1,"BAD, Do not Purchase!",I purchased this product based on all of the positive reviews I had seen on it. It arrived in the mail and does NOT work at all. Then you cannot return it because of the no return policy so I am stuck with a product that I cannot even use. Recommend against buying!
3,Made in Cina,"It smells like acetone or some sort of strong chemical. It is made in China so Doc Johnson should get over there and find out what it is made of and is it safe. The instructions say not to use a lubricant with it, I would sure like to know why. I do enjoy the squirmy and so I just use condoms with it."
4,Works great but wrong color,"I love the toy. It works really well. My only thing though is that even though the box said purple, the toy I received was quite clearly pink. It's not a deal breaker for me, but I could see it bothering someone else."
2,amazing... when it works,"This is the second one of these I've purchased. The first one was AMAZING. It was so good that even though it stopped working after a handful of uses, I bought another one. The second one does not work at all. I tried 2 different brands of batteries (yes, I used all 3, I know theres a battery compartment on the back), and it doesn't work. Unfortunately I didn't get to use it until about 2 months after I bought it, so it's not under the 30 day warranty the company offers. So buy it if you dare, because if it works, you're in for a treat. But try it as soon as you get it because if it doesn't work there's the warranty."
5,Best Vibrator ever!,This is the best vibrator ever! It gives me orgasms almost instantly! In addition its really quiet.I definately reccoment this product
4,DJ Lucid Dream,This DJ product is very good and has a wide range of combinations for stimulation. It is quiet for a combination vibrator/rotating head and for my wife it gets the job done.
2,"Great Design, Poor Materials","I would have loved this product, but I had to throw it away due to the overpowering chemical smell. It was advertised as PVC free, but I can't believe it."
1,The product DID NOT WORK,"Out of the box, I inserted brand new batteries (the correct way!), pushed the buttons, and it buzzed for about 5 seconds, after which it was completely dead. I tried other batteries, combinations, etc. for several minutes, but nothing happened. The product is defective. Do not buy it!!"
2,question,"HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON ONCE PLACING NEW TRIPLE AAA BATTERIES INSIDE?????? I GOT THIS IN THE MAIL AND CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO TURN THIS VIBRATOR ON,"
2,Not worth it,"I have had this item for less than a month now and it is broken. I don't know how, but it has just stopped working, I am very disappointed. I did not even use it in water or anything. I will not buy another of these as I have had another doc Johnson vibrator that quit on me after a week or so also. These products are cheaply made, that's why they are cheap in price. Buyer beware."
4,Shocking Pink,"This arrived in a see through box within a box. So unable to open discreetly or make sure you are alone before opening the outer package.After reading the review I decided to wash it to eliminate the rubbery smell.I did that, put in the batteries and it worked. So we decided to try it out. Works great but to my utter dismay I was left with pink dye all over me inside and out. ICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I jumped in the shower and cleaned myself, hubby was not impressed. I have not used it since but have washed it in hot soapy water and saw no more dye but never saw it the first time either.The product itself is a fun toy and will be used often if no more dye issues."
1,sad day,"so I bought this truly hoping that mine wouldn't be arrive broken like so many other reviewers had experienced.I got it, put in the correct batteries. Nothing happened. Swapped out those new batteries, put in other ones...no dice. Never turned on. Pretty disappointed."
1,dissapointment,i read the reviews that said it didnt work and to not buy it but i didnt listen and with my luck i should of yes i got it and it looked fine but then i put brandnew batteries in and......NOTHING i tried multiple sets of batteries and none worked i am very unhappy and was really hoping it would of worked so dont waste your time and money i would buy a different product brand
1,Good Until it Broke After 2 months,"This was a fine product. The vibrator featured multiple settings and worked very well. One of the nice features of the product was that it was waterproof, which made cleaning it very easy. Battery life was okay--about one hour of use before the three Triple A batteries needed to be changed.Then it broke after 2 months of very intermittent. The vibrator would simply not turn on. Changing the batteries did not fix the problem.This is certainly NOT a value, in my mind. I would recommend looking for a more dependable vibrator."
2,Powerful...but doesn't hit the spot,"I was super stoked to get this from my fiance for Christmas since I own another Lucid Dreams product...however when I broke it out of the package and tried it out I was rather disappointed. It wasn't quite thick enough for my liking, nor long enough to reach my g-spot. The clit stimulator didn't hit my clit. :-( It is rather powerful and I do like the rotating head, but it didn't hit the spots it should have quite right. It's not nearly as thick as the picture makes it seem, but I also like them really thick and long. It also is rather loud! Even on the lowest setting it is louder than other vibrators I have had. I overall gave it a 2 star since it was quite powerful and I do like the rotating head, but it didn't hit the right spots and is much louder than it was claimed to be. Overall I was quite disappointed. :-("
1,Do not buy.. these guys are getting rich off of defective merchandise.,"Brand new right out of the box ( and wow does it stink ) with brand new batteries right out of the package and nothing.no power, no spark.. no nothing..Thank you ""sucker"".. no returns is what they are saying.I will never buy from this company again."
3,"great vibe, poor material strength","the outer material tore at the base of the ""Rabbit"" not long after we got this... maybe 12 couples uses and 10 personal uses for Her... more than the dissapointment of it breaking is that she loved it so much... exellent power, good ""feel"", and comfortable size... (for the price I still reccomend it!)"
1,don't waste your money,"This was a total waste of money. It worked once and then died. I was so totally disappointed. This was the first item I've purchased through Amazon that was useless. Amazon, ban Doc Johnson products and stop selling them to satisfied customers!!!!!"
5,loved it,"The wife was skeptical at first. But after we got it going so did she.An update, after a few months and a few other new toys, this one is still her favorite toy. when the rabbit portion of the vibrator hits her spot she really enjoys it.I would highly recommend this toy even for couples. its not too large and with the 2 motors it really does the job."
2,didnt last very long,she never used it in the shower or very frequently and it only worked for a little over a month
4,"It'll get you there, but...","Squirmy will definitely get you there, but it broke after only two weeks and the rotation stops during the most important times."
1,Loud and Bad,"While the clitoral vibe is great and pretty strong with fully charged batteries, this toy is all sorts of bad. The rotation feature so amazingly loud, to the point I thought it was broken. Personally the rotation did nothing for me and I wish it was just two separate vibes. The battery power was another problem. It runs down fast (less than 30min) even with the rotation off, and it starts to loss power almost immediately. Mine broke completely after about 4 weeks, WASTE OF MONEY."
2,really special batteries!!,"i bought this a while ago and still havent got to use it right bought so many types of batteries and it won't work,the first time i tried it i took the old batteries out of my remote and it moved slow..so i figure the batteries were to weak so i went and bought more new batteries it won't even cut on..still on the search to find batteries to get it to work..the old batteries from my remote i can't seem to find them anywhere..doc johnsons products are normally really good..it suprised me with this one..make me wish i would've just gotten another bullet ..simple is just better sometimes..no need for the fancy stuff :/"
3,Not bad,I've been using it like mad for a while and it's still going pretty good though it's becoming rather loud so I believe it is nearing death but even so it's still going good for me! Even if it is noisier. Very nice toy! I'll have to get another or one like it! I just wish it would hold out longer. Hate to put money into another one knowing it'll have to be replaced in 4-7 months.
1,Waste of money,"I was so excited for this toy and I bought it brand new for around $30.00....it worked ONCE! No, not because of the batteries (they were brand new as well), but I only got one use out of it and I can tell you the orgasm wasn't worth the $30.00; so disappointed with the quality of this product!!!! I even work at a porn store, but our mark-up is outrageous so I bought it on amazon, either way - total failure!"
4,I pretty much love it.,"This is honestly a fantastic product. I love it and use it everyday. It isn't too big, but it isn't too small either and WOWZA is it effective. It was worth the money. The only cons are the confusing on/off function (I thought it was broken for quite a while, but finally discovered that you had to push certain buttons) and the battery life."
4,Definitely Worth 30 Bucks!,"This is my first vibrator, and I have to say I quite enjoy it!It's slim enough to be comfortable for a beginner like myself, but big enough so you feel full ;) The vibrations are powerful but quiet, so you can use that function without any worry of being heard. The rotation motor is a little noisy, though, so I would suggest playing some music if you're going to be using it to avoid being overheard. So far, this product has been well worth $30."
3,It's alright.,Trinity Vibes Pink Waterproof Rabbit is better!!!! I really like how it has both the vibrate and the circular motion. The Nub thingy isn't as good as Trinity Vibes Rabbit.
5,Excellent,"This vibrator is amazing! I wasn't totally convinced at first, because it only runs on AAA batteries, but it really gets the job done! Not only does it have three speeds, but it also spins at three different speeds, too. An excellent purchase."
3,"Not here for a long time, here for a good time","My boyfriend bought me this toy as a kind gesture as he was going to be away for several months. This toy did have a chemical smell when I took it out of the packaging. I'm sensitive to certain smells so I wasn't exactly super thrilled when the smell didn't lessen after washing it several times. The 'whirring' noise of the rotation feature was a bit of a turn off and the feature itself didn't do much for me, but the actual vibe was good. It is waterproof, but make sure the cap is on tightly. I broke mine after only using it sparingly for two months. Somehow one of the wires inside was severed so the connection from the motor to the batteries was severed rendering it pretty useless and boring. I would consider purchasing it again if it weren't for the odor that never goes away."
3,Not the best,"So I got this on the fly cause my previous vibrator broke. I like it and it does its job, so does my husband. But it SMELLS, I don't know why but from the minute it comes out the package it SMELLS HORRIBLE. I have tried washing it several times and it just doesn't go away. Other than that about as water proof as any other waterproof object. Battery life is good. There are other vibrators out there that are better."
3,This is my 2nd,It was a much larger item than I was use too. What it is made of had a loud smell. I wiped it in vinegar to get the smell to go away. The top little piece don't do me any good I think it has to do with the build of ever female is not the same. You can't refund so I worked with it the plastic feels good it does the job it's in your hands.
3,Pretty good value for the money,"I agree with the other reviewers who said that this just smells weird - very chemical-like - but you can get over that quickly. I've only used this a few times but it works like a charm. The vibrator function is SO quiet, which is a big help. One drawback is that the rotation part isn't working very well after only a few uses - when I turn it on it doesn't move but you can hear the poor little motor sounding like it's TRYING to move. But I grabbed it and gave it a spin myself and it worked just fine."
3,ok but not quite for me,"The presentation was very nice, and the product is exactly the same as it is depicted in the photo. other than the smell of plastic/rubber, i have almost no issues. its just too big for me, but im very inexperienced. i suppose with time it will be a more enjoyable toy.this is definately not meant for the beginner!"
1,stopped working in just days,dont waste your money on this poor quality vibrator. it just stops working in days. it took me 2 purchases to realize im not the one with problem.
5,WOW,"Ok- let me preface this by saying I have never gone out of my way to review a purchase. Also, for the faint of heart or those who wandered onto this page accidentally, I'll try to keep it short.So, here we go.Note: This is not my first toy... if this is your first time on the merry-go-round, I suggest maybe trying something smaller like the classic butterfly.My Chronological Experience:1) Batteries were easy to install and the control panel is simple and fantastic. Up and Down (no pun intended) controls for level of vibration, Up and Down arrows for speed of rotation, and a button for size of rotation.2) Insert, immediate ecstasy.3) Found my sweet spot, went off like a freakin bottle rocket!4) ""came"" multiple times.5) Basically in a sex coma after6) couldn't walk straight for at least ten minutes afterwards.7) GET IT!! I promise you'll be happy."
4,This Toy is great!!,"This is my first vibrator and I am very pleased. I am very closely built and many times sex can be painful. This toy is not too big and the rotating tip is great! The material does smell weird but I just use a condom and wash it after every use. It does not stink up my house either, I would recommend this to anyone who is concerned about not getting a toy that's too big. BUY THIS I'VE BEEN SMILING ALL DAY :)"
1,One of my worst purchases,"I took this item out of the packaging and was sorely disappointed in how small it was. Upon putting in the batteries (which didn't come with the vibrator), the product didn't turn on. I replaced them only to be truly disappointed with the vibrations. It didn't feel like anything when I attempted to use it and kept shutting off every time it would begin to do its job. I finally gave up on it when it ceased working completely on the first day of use.This product only provided me with disappointment and frustration, for I'd been so excited to receive it. It's not only the worst toy I've ever had, but one of the worst purchases I've ever made on amazon in terms of quality. What a waste of money."
1,SOOOOO PIIIISSSSEEEDDD OFFFF,I am furious!!!! I was so excited to get this in the mail and when it finally arrive it won't even turn off. Yes I put in batteries...tried several brand new ones in fact. Hard earned money down the drain. Now instead of relaxing with my new toy I have to go work some extra hours just to pay off the damn thing!!
2,Crap.,"The batteries don't hold energy well...This thing died a month after I got it.You can still use it after it's dead - although, you better have extra juice on hand."
2,Pick a different toy.,"I was originally excited to get this toy (in more ways than one), but was severely disappointed. I am fairly gentle with my toys, but this vibrator stopped working after the single initial use. I now have a pricey dead toy sitting in my drawer."
1,bad buy,I would not recomend this product. It broke with in a week. When it did work it wasn't very powerful and the nub part was not comfortable either. It is defitaly not worth the money.
2,Worked fine for a time,Used a lot of batteries. Then the vibrate feature stopped. No fun without the vibration. Will never buy another one.
2,doesn't cut it,"The rotating part doesn't provide much sensation and after a few months, the silicone tore where the vibrator is attached to the shaft. Up until then, it was decent--quiet and a good size. I was really upset by the torn silicone, because my previous vibrators had all died on me from mechanical failure. It's a shame that in this case, the mechanical parts were will working fine, but it's still unusable."
4,GREAT!!!,"FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD LOVE TO PUT 5 STARS BUT IT DOES SMELL. YOU PASS THE SMELL WHEN YOU ENJOY IT. I GOT THE PRODUCT TODAY AND MY HUSBAND WAS LIKE COME ON LETS TRY IT OUT RIGHT NOW AND I WAS NERVOUS BECAUSE THIS WAS OUR FIRST TOY AND I DIDNT WANT HIM TO THINK I LIKED IT BETTER THEN HIM. SO I SAID FINE LET GO TRY IT OUT AND OMG I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IT WAS AMMMMMAAAAAAZZZZZING!!!! WE ALSO GOT ANOTHER PRODUCT BECAUSE I DIDNT JUST WONT THIS TYPE OF VIBRATOR I WANTED TO ALSO HAVE A SLIM ONE. I ALWAYS TOLD MY SELF THAT I WOULDNT BE CAUGHT DEAD WITH SEX TOYS, BUT THEN MY HUSBADN AND I WANTED TO EXPLORE MORE SINCE WE ARE CHRISTIANS AND WE REALLY DIDNT KNOW MUCH ABOUT SEX AND WE WANTED TO EXPLORE EACH OTHER TO SEE WHAT TURNS US ON MORE.SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT ITEIM FOR A FIRST TOY. ITS ALSO NOT TO BIG WHICH I AM GLAD."
1,Not so great....,"I ordered this the other day and received it this morning. Well, it's going back in the mail first thing in the morning. This product is WAY too large. Deffientaly not for your first toy. Maybe I can find something else...."
3,a hot mess,"BESIDES THE SMELL IT'S OK.YOU WILL GET THE PLEASURE BUT TAKE A LONG TIME .YES AM A BBW NOT LONG ENOUGH AND NOT ENOUGH INTENSE FOR ME I HAVE BOUGHT BETTER,FOR A CHEAP PRICE."
5,One of My Favorites...,Dmitri was a favorite of the Haas MBA'97 class. I attended the CD release party and performance for Red Reflections in December 1995 (an infinately better investment of one's time than studying for the econ final two days away) and have enjoyed attending several of Dmitri's performances.
3,A must have for Robin fans. A fad for anyone else.,"This set is okay but nothing special if you have the Joan Sutherland and Mady Mesple recordings. Mado Robin has a light sweet voice perfectly suited to French coloratura roles. I wish she would have sang the second High E in the Bell Song instead of replacing it with a High A-flat (although it is impressive) but her singing is quite smooth as always.The rest of the cast is adequate but not particulary memorable. Georges Sebastian and the orchestra sound fine but the dry boxy recording does them no favors. Now I wish someone would re-release the Lakme excerpts with Renee Doria, Alain Vanzo and Robert Massard."
4,Lakme all in one.,"I have always loved this opera and I decided to get all the songs to listen on my iPod. I liked this album a lot except for it was split into acts for each track which was fine, but I wished that it was split into the numbers in the acts so I can pick each specific pieces if I wanted to hear it again on repeat instead of having to find it at specific time on one track of each act. Even with that fall back this was a great album and I can't help but love it more and more each time I listen to ""Duo Des Fleurs""."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This CD Features Many wonderful tenors. Unfortunately, the tenor singing the title aria ""Nessun Dorma"" is not really fit to sing such a demanding piece. If you are buying this CD for that aria, I recommend you look elsewhere, but if you like the other arias on this CD, it is a great buy!"
5,Just what we wanted as a trunk for the luggage rack of the cycle.,"It is very nice quality at a reasonable price. My sissy bar angles a bit backwards which prevents the bag from fully opening, but that does not prevent it from functioning well. The D-rings on the sides that are visible and the ones hidden by the side compartments are very useful. The appearance is excellent and shows its quality. Very pleased with this purchase."
3,"A middling compilation, not quite in the top tier","The compilation offers a good, low-cost alternative to several other pricier collections. However, I have to admit that I still prefer Harnoncourt (Teldec or Warner Classics), Kertesz (Decca), and Kubelik (DG) in this repertoire, even if they do cost a little more.John J. PuccioClassical Candor"
3,"not bad, but it's not Squarepusher","Venetian Snares is often compared to Squarepusher. Sure, both artists apply the same frentic chopped up breakbeat technique which superficially sounds quite alike. But where Squarepusher still manages to make it all swing and give it a very musical twist, Venetian Snare's beats often sound either stiff or just very chaotic without much musical interest. For me this often leads to some weariness after a a few tracks: it all just sounds too much alike. Of course, Venetian Snare's style *is* breakcore and not drum & bass, but it would be pleasant if he showed some sense of adventure and would venture into other styles more.Still, this is not bad music by far. It is excellently produced and contains some interesting feats of sonic layering. So who knows: Venetian Snares might be onto something really groundbreaking in the future. Not just yet, though."
5,Easy-to-Follow Recipes are Great!,"Bob Skilnik's book not only gives the lowdown on low carb, but it gives drink recipes that even I, a non-bartender, can follow. Now when I have a party, I can impress my friends with drinks that range from the old standbys to ones they've never heard of--all of which taste great! And for those friends watching their carbs, they're grateful to boot.The Low Carb Bartender is a book that pulls no punches and gives it to us straight--or on the rocks."
5,Sweet Byrd,"Propers are those parts of liturgy that are variable, changing with the date as different events or saints are represented in their turn. This disc contains musical settings by William Byrd of propers for Ascension, Pentecost, Corpus Christi and the Blessed Sacrament. The music of Byrd, arguably the greatest composer of the English Renaissance, shines in these performances, which run over 70 minutes in all. Alternatively vigorous and contemplative, these madrigal-like pieces are brought to life by The Cardinall's Musick. I listen to early vocal music on a casual basis, and this is one of my favorites. Highly recommended."
5,Astounding!,"Clive Gregson is perhaps the most talented, insightful, brilliant songwriter I have ever heard. He grasps love, heartache, regret, and cynicism -- yet can rock out, scream on guitar, and fingerpick up a storm -- with unmatched talent. Buy this and ALL his CDs, including those with Christine Collister. HUGELY TALENTED!"
5,Remarkable,"The most authoritative reference book in the field.Impressive!Larger than life.An odyssey of information.Immense.In summary, reading these volumes was a remarkable learning experience."
3,it is ok,"I need more of volumes from the set, for a used book it was in great condition. Will add more of the set over time"
4,Talent Composer !,"When I listen to Vieuxtemps (vyae-tahn) I am really reminded of Mendelssohn and a bit of Tchaikovsky! You can tell Vieutemps was joyful and proud in composing these works, as the flair is one of pleasure and delectation.Dazzling violin expertise and mechanics abound throughout! The good orchestral background assures the quality, concern, and refinement. Exciting and tight is the overall sound!Thanks for another low cost value and tasteful product Naxos !!Have a good day my Friends !"
5,Sorry Wrong Number,"I have always wanted to rate this item. Sorry Wrong Number is the best suspense book I have ever read in my life. It is unique, it is believable, and it grows.Unfortunately, I tried to read another one of Lucille Fletcher's books called Mirror Image, and it was very scary, but there was WAYYY too much langauge and sex. Be careful!"
5,Dame Edna being Barry Humphries,"This CD has many desirable features. It contains three of the most popular musical works for children, by famous composers, which are accompanied by narration. The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of John Lanchbery, performs admirably. But the really outstanding thing about the disc is the narrations. Barry Humphries performs them all. Or, rather, Barry Humphries being 'Dame Edna Everage' performs two of them and the third one is performed by Barry Humphries being Barry Humphries. For many people, his moving narration of 'The Story of Babar, the Little Elephant' will come as a delightful surprise because they have never heard his 'real' voice before. Is there no end to this man's talents? There are only about half a dozen 'celebrities' I would like to meet in the flesh; he is one of them."
5,Simply wonderful for a young imagination!,"My three year old Grandson is fired by other children's experiences at nursery school, not always the best of influences for a child who doesn't have a TV! To fire his imagination positively I sent this version of Peter & The Wolf to him,funnily enough in Australia! My daughter tells me Dame Edna has won his heart & this is played every day and now many of the children in school are playing out the story too, so much better than horrors poor souls have seen inadvertently on adult programmes and home turmoils. He was even allowed to take it into school and it was played with teacher there, further promoting projects for art classes and music appreciation. Thanks again Prokofiev! You were good for me, my Children now my Grandchildren, some things don't need to change!!"
4,"Good for Travel, Fits like a Glove","This is my first bcd and I love it. The sizing tends to run large. If you think you're medium, you're probably a small. And if you think you're a large, you're probably a medium. The great thing is the amount of adjustability in all of the component pieces and it's so comfortable. Having the bladder be on the back makes a huge difference in feeling more streamlined and less stilted. My only complaint is the relative lack of pockets - but this is the trade-off in getting a lightweight BC. There is a pocket on the front right hand side, which pulls out of a pouch. There are 2 tank straps in the back. I'm really happy with choosing this BC."
2,Great information,"Learned a lot about the Jackson family from reading this book. However, never know if LaToya is completely truthful. I don't know...judge for yourself."
1,This book should be in the fiction file,"I have read twelve books about the Jackson family, including LaToya's, and from what I read this book is thirty percent true LaToya even said that her ex-husband (Jacks Gordan) wrote seven chapters of the book, and what the hell does he know about the Jacksons, so when I read this I had to read two other Jackson books so I could tell what is real and what isnt. so unless your a die hard Jackson fan I wouldnt recommend this."
4,sexy and sassy,"I got lots of compliments in this costume and even won ""sexiest costume"" at the party I attended. It is definitely made to fit a size three, no larger, and is very short, so if you aren't comfortable showing off your legs and butt, it is not the costume for you. I, however, had a blast wearing it."
1,Teen Red Riding Hood Costume,The costume itself is extremely small but the biggest complaint is with the company Brands on Sale. Extremely poor customer service> I had to wait for 1 1/2 hrs. to talk to a representative and then he was rude and unhelpful. I would not purchase anything from this company again!
2,"Too short, not enough information","While I didn't DISLIKE this video, I really didn't find it helpful at all. It was more a video on ""what did I do in Rome"" versus ""what YOU can do in Rome"". I'd suggest getting a solid travel guide (DK Eyewitness makes really great ones) and a more in-depth DVD about Rome itself. ""Engineering an Empire: Rome"" was a little dry, but VERY informative; and it was really neat seeing the history of all the Roman landmarks, not just the coliseum.If you're going to buy it, don't spend more than five dollars. It's not worth more than that."
4,Neat,"Throbbing Gristle had produced a legendary series of cassettes with all(?) their live shows. Of course they have been unavailable almost since day 1. This was/is a lavishly produced new edition of that collection. Even if you like some of their stuff, this is completely overwhelming. This is a group that had its moments of brilliance and some of these were live and are thus on these discs. The prsentation is spectacular even if it is expensive. One problem with TG is that already a lot of their shows were available in official/half-official/bootlge format so anyoen interested will own at least part of it."
2,TOO LONG!,"For what Greier is trying to say, ie the state of current capitalism, a half page newspaper add would have been sufficient. He uses basically the same example over and over again.....i hate to be the one who shoots the messenger of bad news, but BANG! Damn you Greider for wasting my time!"
5,He clears the smoke,This book is a must read for all those who wonder what must be done to avert the next economic crash and contain capitalism gone berserk
2,Way too lengthy for the message delivered,"You get the feeling Greider gets paid by the word. He has example after example after example. Basically, he had a trip around the world, took some notes, wrote down everything (without adding much content) and declared it a business expense. Viola'. Welcome to the world of the self-employed. Read the comments of others, and you will understand the message. Basically, the world is changing, labor is cheaper in the 3rd world (duh!) and you better learn new skills. The other 400 pages are examples. Bag it."
1,Poor logic or economics,"I would like to begin by saying that I did not finish this book (read about 3/4). This is a sensationalist book for non-economists who wish to sound like they know economics.The premisse is that the world will be in trouble because productivity is rising too fast (faster than demand) and so prices will plummet, so will earnings, and so will standards of living. This is the old argument that leads to the conclusion that one day robots will do it all and there will be nothing for humans to do. It is an argument that has been refuted, as it is clear that, as soon as we are able to produce more of something than we can consume, we move on to produce other things that are needed. The author assumes there is a limit to things and services that can be produced, which has not been the case and there is no reason to believe that it will be.This is inane economics for the populist mind at its best."
1,Anti-Globalists Disavow this book,"This is a well written book. Congratulations Mr. Greider. However, his anaylsis is of the worst kind. He takes a kernel of truth and constructs a scenario wholly devoid of critical thinking: so he is not an academian. However, he has a reponsibility to present valid, relevant, concrete examples to support his scenario. Instead we get a vaugue book filled with easily debunked innuendo. If you are truly against globalism, then do not use this book to support your agenda, your arguements will be ignored at best."
5,CITIZEN GREIDER,"GREIDER LIKES TO TAKE ON BIG JOBS, FROM QUESTIONING THE ""HOLY WRIT'' OF REAGONOMICS, TO UNEARTHING THE SMUG SECRECY OF THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE, TO MORALLY DISGRACING POWERFUL MULTINATIONALS SUCH AS GENERAL ELECTRIC. ANYONE WHO RECIEVED AN IN-YOUR-FACE CONFRONTATION BY CENTRIST BILL CLINTON DESERVES A GOOD REVIEW. AND NOW HE TAKES ON THE MONSTROUS, NO-ONE-AT-THE-HELM GLOBAL ECONOMY. HERE IS A VERY THOUGHTFUL MAN REACHING THE DARK, DAMNING SECRETS OF THE ONE WORLD SWEATSHOP. CONGRATULATIONS TO WILLIAM GREIDER FOR THIS EFFORT."
4,an excellent look at american inginuity and know-how!,"this video does an excellent job of showing the history of the canal from the earliest french involvement, and eventual failure, to the intervention of teddy roosevelt and the american inginuity, skill and force of will that made the canal a reality. an excellent watch for anyone interested in american history, foreign policy, or science and technology. a must for educators!"
5,classic,The greatest of all mafia/gangster stories. This book belongs in every library. The only negative criticism I have is that Puzo isn 't very knowledgeable about firearms. This is evident a couple of times in the story.
5,Van Wihitfield Does It Again,"The writer below must have a personal problem with this author as he or she posted the same review on Barnes and Noble. It's shameful that anyone would have problems with such a wonderful book. The message is so strong for our Black young men. Where else are they reading about responsibility in such a lighthearted, yet straight forward manner? Whitfield has written an incredibly funny book with one of the most vivid characters in contemporary fiction. I followed his career closely and am amazed at how good he is and how much his writing grows. He is one of the most sought after writers in the business, and writes for TV, film and the book world. I could see this book being a sitcom. The thoughts of a man facing an unplanned pregnancy are priceless unto themselves. I can't wait for his next book. If you're reading this - HURRY UP VAN, YOUR FANS ARE WAITING!!! This is a must read!"
3,A good way to spend a rainy Monday,"I've read Mr. Whitfield's previous books. This was ok. I didn't particularly care for any of the characters bcuz I didn't think I knew them at all. I would have like to read more about Shawn's relationship with Troi. One minute he's not sure he wants to be a father and the next they are spending time together. How did that happen? And Donnie... what was the purpose of his character? He had good lines, but that was just about it. I liked Kelly.... but Dawn was in one minute, out the next, and back in. Like I said above, just a way to spend a lazy, rainy Monday."
5,Excellent,"Excellent text about a very complex issue. While this book focuses on Latino gay men, the psychological barriers concerning risk are very relevant to almost everyone. Definitely worth reading and sharing with friends."
1,Awful,"The first few pages are falling out of the book, and you never answered my question about the quality."
2,Forced . . . .,"Hughes here creates amusing and witty tales, but both the amusement and the wit are mostly mild. The chiefest failing is that Hughes seems to be trying too hard, rather like the amateur comedian who has to repeat the punch line in three different forms. I did enjoy the book, and will read more Hughes, but if I had to sum it up, I'd say he seems someone who always wanted to be R. A. Lafferty when he grew up."
4,Intertaining reading,This book held my attention as there is plenty of action. When you think you know where it is going there is a new twist to the action added. The subject matter will keep the history buffs as well as science fiction readers interested. Would suggest this book to adults of all ages.
4,Good way to pass some time,"Not bad if you're a fan of science fiction and time travel. Character development is weak and the story line is a bit disjointed, but it passes the time. With a bit more attention to details this could have been a really good read."
5,The Time Traders,I have always enjoyed stories by Andre Norton. This one is no exception. Fast paced and tends to bring out the rebellious nature in all of us.
3,Nice action story,"Fun but not one I would re-read. Actually I thought it would make a great premise for aTV series, though."
2,Science fiction,My husband lost interest very rapidly. Too bad. Hopefully he will find something else more enjoyable to read during his time of relaxation.
4,Great story by a master of science fiction,"This story is one that most people who read science fiction have loved since it was first published, and it is well worth having on any person's bookshelf, It is a little dated but the pace and action keeps you on the edge of your seat."
4,Old fashioned fun,What's not to like about good old fashioned cheesy sci go.....a fun easy read. Andre Norton never disappoints his fans.
4,Time Trader,I have been adicted to Andre Norton since I was a mere youngster. Ms Norton is one of the few writers that has never failed to stimulate my imagination. I had a collection of her books but have lost them in my many moves. I never get tired of re-reading her stories. I can't remember ever being disapointed with her work.
2,So so,"Good fantasy book, I like the time journeys the main characters go through. But it gets a little corny, and boring in places."
3,Interesting book.,"I love time travel stories but found this story to be too full of plot changes, location changes, and, frankly, it was just much too much! It became tedious and I found it difficult to keep track of the storyline once I put the book down for the night. It did offer some imaginative and fun ideas which made up for the distracting plot lines. I gave it a 3 star rating which I think is very fair."
4,Good yarn,This was the first Andre Norton book I've read. I will be reading more - I loved the story and the characters.
4,torx,sockets worked fine for removing alternator on mercedes. appear to be very durable and are the right sizes for most jobs
5,Do It Yourself Satellite TV,Great product for use in expanding Satellite TV. Easy to use and priced right. The TV company wanted $60.00 for parts and installation. Do the math and treat yourself with the difference.
2,return,"The DTV dish I ordered from Amazon didn't work, it was an international roof mounted device, not at all what I asked for, I needed the tripod they advertised. DTV replaced it, the multiswitch they said it required was not at all on either unit. How do I return it?"
5,SCHUBERT WORKS,Here is another great set of music by Schubert.The duo was very short but worth hearing.The rondeau is another rare one movement work that is great to hear.
3,PLASTIC SEAT COVER,"I was suprised when I opened the box and discovered that the plush seat cover shown in the picture was actually hard vinyl that didn't seem to fit well on the seat. The product came out of the box filthy and needed to be cleaned before being put together.Size wize it is perfect, fits ideally on my dining room chair and I feel very confident that it won't move. It was easy to put together and the tray removal and recline features are really easy. It is also conveniently small enough to take with you on a road trip, so if you are going to grandma's house it will very easily travel with you."
4,Almost the perfect highchair.,"I almost love everything about this chair. The only problems I have encountered with it is that when I first received it and was putting it together, I ripped the material at a seam. So I think the material should be more durable. The second problem is also with the material. It is very slick which makes it fabulous to clean but not so fabulous when I put my baby in because she slides down a little bit. Not too much but she does slide. Other than that this chair is great! I would make the same decision to buy it again if I had to do it over."
5,Excellent,I LOVE this high chair. It is one of the best baby products I have seen. It's very adjustable. It reclines for younger children and the height adjust also. We have an eat at island and it fits great in our bar stool so our baby can be at our level. He loves to sit in it while we're cooking and I love that it makes me feel like he is right there with me without having a big bulky high chair. Plus it converts to a booster seat for when he gets older. I have nothing negative to say about this product.
5,Great High Chair at a Great Price,"I am very pleased with the purchase of the Fisher Price Space Saver High Chair. It is compact without being too small and it has all the features I was looking for in a high chair: dishwasher safe tray, reclining seat and a seat cover that can be wiped clean. It attached to my dining room chair easily and can also easily be removed if the chair is needed for a dinner guest. I would absolutely recommend this product."
2,"Tsk, tsk amazon","Just received the box that the chair arrived in today. Opened the delivery box to find a very dirty box the chair was encased in. Finally got the chair out and noticed that there were certain scratches on it as if someone had used it. It was on the plastic so I did not mind it. Then I noticed that there was also some sticky marks on the green cushion. Hmmm...? To top it off, the logo on the front of the tray is faded. What is the deal Amazon? If I wanted to buy a used seat, I would have gone to a garage sale!"
3,Basic Cat Care,"I picked this book up at the pet store right before I got my first cat. This book gives a good over-view for someone who is a new cat owner. There is plenty of information on cat care and training. Also good information on cats living with dogs and children. The big downfall of this book is that it is badly translated from German. And it looses alot in the translation, making it hard to read. Some parts had to be read over, because they did not make sense due to the translation problem. I feel the publisher should have checked this over more carefully, because it makes the book, which has alot of good information, very difficult to read."
3,wolfhound,i wouldnt recommend this movie it was extremely long seemed to jump around and was quite dull. if you want a good action movie with a decent plot line then look elsewhere.
3,surprisingly good!,"this film isn't as bad as it seems, the acting is decent, the plot is alright. not a bad buy for the price. the special effects need a bit of tweaking but all around worth it."
2,Huh? Whahoppen?,"Saw this last night. Visually stunning and epically stupid. Inane. Complete rip-off of the first ten minutes of Conan the Barbarian, lumberingly and staggeringly dense and ""huh?"" throughout, and ending with a climax straight from He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (throwing in the Happy Bat from Ferngully).Worth getting just for the shock factor."
2,No heat control?,"I bought this heater for the safety features. When it tips, it turns off. When it overheats, it turns off. Great. But the Amazon description should have told me something: ONE HEAT SETTING. I have never seen a heater without at least a rudimentary thermostat. I can find no control on this one. So, when IT gets too hot, it turns off, but what about when *I* get too hot?? I have to get up and turn it off until I get cold. Then I have to get up and turn it on until I get too hot. This is an advance? It says it is smart, but it makes assumptions about how hot I want my room. It should ask ME what I want. Sorry, no deal."
1,Bad heater,Please don't buy this heater. It shut off after 30 seconds and won't turn back on forever. Do not recommended.
5,hard to find,this was a very hard to find item. My son was very happy to get it and it arrived very quickly. packaging was great.
4,Good Film,"If you like freestyle motocross and Travis Pastrana I highly recommend this video. Its a good story of a kids dream come true. A must see horror, look out Jason and Freddy cause here comes Travis!!!"
4,Get it!,If you enjoy watching Nitro Circus why not get this as well. Get video on Travis's journey through life. It does include things from the Nitro Circus videos you may have already seen but talks more about them.
4,Travis Pastrana's 199 Live's,I thought that this movie was great because it showed a lot about travis's life and explains the reasons why he does what he does.
3,not so fast!!,"my daughter (yes four year old daughter)saw this and wanted it for Xmas. We picked it up (...) to play and see if it was a sure pick. After we figured out where the batteries went. We started it up. It did not come with any instructions!!! It made a siren sound and took off (very loud)driving with the driving motor sound. then stoped and made a siren sound again. This toy was just not for us, it was very noisy (that may be fine for you.) It felt very cheep and the rc pad could be broke easily."
4,my little brothers toy,I asked my brother how much he likes his fire truck he got for his birthday and he said it was a lot of fun he draws a map on it and makes it go like the drawing he made and i like to help him cause its fun to play with i am bigger so i can show him how to play with it right
3,fire truck,"to be honest with you, i was not too happy with how this truck is made......In my opinion, its made rather cheap.the tires on it are hard plastic. its cute yes....but i dont think its very good quality!"
1,Not what I expected,"My first experience ordering from amazon.com wasn't very good. The new battery I ordered doesn't hold a charge, whether the camera was being used or not. The ""equivalent"" is not equal! I will not order again."
1,Cheap battery. Little life.,"This battery held its charge for just over 120 shots. It barely approaches the OEM specifications! The original battery, which is two years old, had at least 10 times the staying power as this poor replacement. But what do you expect for $7? That's about what use I got out of it. I'll keep it charged and in my bag for emergencies, but I know I won't get many shots out it.I cannot recommend this battery. Look elsewhere. And remember, you get what you pay for."
5,Great feel and smell,I have purchased Blue Grass Bath powder a long time ago and until now had not been able to find it at my local cosmetic counter.. I am glad it is available somewhere.
3,Not enough protection,"Company could do a better job of making a real ""full protection wrap-around"" deflector that actually protects the entire front lip of the hood area.This unit, purchased for a 2007 Honda Odyssey, is nice looking and tall enough but only covers the front-center portion of the hood -- not above the top of the headlights to the left and right edges of the hood.In todays tech world, this can be accomplished. This is nothing more than a lack of will on the part of the products leading mfg in this area! Probably would not buy again."
5,Great resource for new and experienced development teams,I found this book a great resource for communicating with clients that have no clue about IT development as well as a refresher in the right way to plan and execute website developmnet that is often rushed and overlooked.It is a good reminder of how to alter one's language when working with non-technical clients as well as explain what to expect. It gives an easy to understand overview of the steps in the process to create a website so that everyone is on the same page (no pun intended).It is well worth having in one's library!
4,Tell All Your Friends - Nonexistent Bonus Tracks!,Can someone please help me? I bought the album yesterday yet when I put the CD into the CD player or the computer the bonus tracks are nowhere to be seen. There are supposed to be 12 tracks aren't there?? Could someone please email me or reply and let me know if you know the answer to this annoying question!
1,What the...?,"This deal was the biggest rip off! What DID indeed happen to the extra videos promised on the back? Victory, just keep reaping that bad press..."
1,Disappointing,"This movie is not a tribute to Flower. It is not even factual. I highly recommend getting the book Meerkat Manor: Flower of the Kalahari by Tim Clutton-Brock. The narration is disappointing. Sean Astin does a perfect job narrating in Meerkat Manor Seasons 1-3. I would prefer to buy Meerkat Manor Seasons 1-3 than this movie. Although, I did enjoy seeing footage of Flower and Zaphod together again as adults (I think it was really them)."
2,Whoopi is Awful,"I love Meerkat Manor and I really like Whoopi Goldberg, but she is really awful as the narrator of this film. She mumbles through the whole thing and is often indecipherable. We're essentially watching a nature show, and Whoopi keeps deadpanning jokes and stumbling through the lines in an unnatural way. They should have just kept the same narrator as from the regular show."
4,Not so bad.,"In my opinion, the movie really isn't as bad as everyone says; I've got one problem with it, and that is the actual footage of the Meerkats shown in the movie are just random Meerkats that basically happened to 'do what the film crew wanted them to,' and when they did, they edited the tape together to give us the movie. If the movie was actually filmed like the Meerkat Manor series in which the actual named Meerkats are being filmed in their lives, then the movie would have been much more pleasing.Whoopi's narrative is a bit different from what viewers may be used to, but I think she adds something 'special' and different for the movie, since the movie IS a bit different from the series. It's a good 'prequel' to the series for someone who has never seen it.I still favour the series over the movie, but the movie is still worth seeing if you love meerkats and are open-minded to a different narrator."
2,Sean Astin - Where Are You?,"I've tried 3 times to watch this movie and I'm only half through it - and decided to see what others are saying. Whoppi Goldberg's narration is AWFUL. Sean Astin's narration made the series dynamite - and we were REALLY watching the one-and-only real Flower. It is sad to see such a wonderful series debased by such a terrible movie. Meerkat Manor, the series, rocks. Meerkat Manor, the movie, sucks !"
2,Disappointing: Not What It's Cracked Up to Be,"Weak script, not enough real film footage and detail about Flower, skims and skips too much, not satisfying. Not like the TV show of Meerkat Manor. I bought the film to watch on my own time. If I had known it wasn't worth it, I wouldn't have bothered to buy it. Was a real fan of the TV show."
1,"Sean, Come Home!","I am completely addicted to the series, but I can't get all the way through it, either. The narration is indecipherable, passionless and, well, just awful. Choosing Sean Astin to narrate the series was brilliant. Why he was not chosen to narrate this movie makes no sense. True, it is a tribute to Flower, but most of it is recreated, with very few scenes of the ""real"" stars. Sean's narration would have made this thing watchable. Don't waste your money; read the Professor's book instead!"
4,software,The software is very useful but with my limited knowledge ofprograms it took awhile to learn how to get the most out of it.
1,False Advertising,"I purchased this program to use on my windows 95. It was advertised as for windows 95, but when I received it, the program required windows 98 or higher."
1,"Don't be suckered by the ""cheap-trick"" title to this really bad work","#1. Write a bad symphony.#2. Give it an intriguing descriptive title -- preferably relating to some heartstring-tugging event.#3. Hope that people will look past the awful music and program/play the composition anyway because of its interesting political or historical context.Thankfully, the classical-listening audience is a lot smarter than that!"
5,Better than expected,I bought them because they were kind of cheap... and they are great. They fit great in my ears and the sound quality is very good. The case is also very helpful
3,For Avid Chona Fans Only,"The only reason to watch this video is if you are an avid Chona Jason fan. I am. Unfortunately, the rest of the actors and actresses are not at all appealing.I was impressed expertise of Chona in the brief martial arts scenes. And in the erotic scenes, Chona is quite gorgeous. All of her erotic scenes are lesbian ones."
4,"JM Mill Valley,CA","With all of the 500 page business books with their myriad proclamations as to what constitutes good leaderhip, I found this book refreshing. To me, the important key message of this book is that great leadership comes from one who has has integrity, fortitude and a keen sense of what is right, and one who has been challenged to apply those qualities when making, sometimes unpopular, critical decisions. Those reading this book looking for a cookbook for leadership will be disappointed. Those looking to better understand how Winston Churchill exemplified the qualities of great leadership and how he applied them throughout his life, not just when faced the adversity, will be inspired and motivated by this book. It is also a particularly good book for young people who are still shaping their own senses of personal values."
2,Torando KC-30-C Review,"Item had a very good price over other sites, as for functionality, I didn't notice any difference in gas mileage. I'm glade I didn't pay the going price of $65."
3,So-so brief tour of Paris,"Very brief.Some good scenery.Not enough on historic buildings/architecture. And I actually found the female guide snotty and sometimes downright rude.I am surprised I feel that way,but she was pretty irritating.Kind of smug.If I was lucky enough to be visiting/describing Paris,I think I would be less irritating and much more delighted in what/who I was looking at.I don't like hurting people's feelings,but I found myself actually talking back to the screen a few times in almost anger.Could be just me,but different strokes and all.I'm sure there must be a lot of Paris travel guides on DVD that are better than this one.I'll keep looking."
3,Too Short!,"This video is too short. It offers very little information before you make the trip, and it seems nothing after you come back from the trip.Globe Trekker does a good job in general, but not this one."
1,Very disappointing DVD,"Rather than a DVD about Paris, this seems to be a DVD about an American woman in her 40s who likes to be filmed in her pyjamas, or wrapped in a towel, or chatting up men saying how cute they are.Virtually nothing here on the sites of one of Europe's best cities.Don't waste your money."
1,painfully bad,"Justine has good energy but her commentary is thoughtless. Didn't anyone write a script for her? She obviously doesn't realize that she is being negative throughout the video - taxi drivers will overcharge you, street and metro are dirty, fashion is ugly, people are rude."
3,"Nice footage, negative host","I am a French teacher and I really like showing Globe Trekker videos in class because of their holistic representation of the different countries, but Justine Shapiro is a poor guide. My students always love the videos hosted by Ian Wright because of his upbeat attitude, but Justine's commentary comes across as negative. She's often critical and pessimistic (""this dress looks like a tent; this one like a flight-attendant's costume"", ""of all the people in Paris why did I cook with so and so"" etc). Paris is so breathtaking that it looks good despite her, but she doesn't add much."
1,Almost a complete waste of money,Why?This DVD is almost exactly the same as the first one.Same argument with same boring taxi driver.Re-hash; get the first one.Yet even that is about as poorly filmed and boring as this second one.
3,Short on examples,"While the HOT photoshop book only teaches through steps and examples often failing to show how to get there independently, this book omits the steps entirely and is not integrated with the practice cd provided. I found myself often frustrated with the lack of examples and the lack of integration with the practice images provided. Perhaps this book is better geared towards intermediate to advanced users, but it falls short for beginers."
2,"Not enough detail, and not up to date","This is the first book that I read on Snort, and I wish I had gone with something else. This book really reads like more of an overview of intrusion detection and Snort, rather than a useful reference for actually using Snort. This would be fine if the title did NOT include the words ""Advanced"" or ""Techniques,"" because there is not a lot of either in this book. It also doesn't help that it's not written to the latest release. If you want to understand intrusion detection a little better and you are considering to try Snort, then this books is fine. If you want or need more, this just isn't the book."
2,Just OK,"I got this book and read through it (didn't take me long. It's pretty short and actually has less than 200 pages really covering Snort). I was disappointed that it did not come with a CD with all the software. Also, this book covers Snort 1.9.0, but 2.0 just came out. I'm not sure why they didn't update everything to the latest version, which would have made it much more usefel. I guess it's not bad if you really just want a quick introduction to IDSs and Snort, but look elsewhere if you really want an in depth book on Snort."
2,Fun Intellectual Property Analysis in Otherwise Poor Product,"Basically, the Riddler in the Dini-produced Batman animated series is an intelligent, creative person who gets little return from his creations exploited by major corporations. The irony of Dini's pulling off this story while Time-Warner was growing and soon to join with AOL is pretty funny. The stories are pretty solid, too. Of course, Batman gets to rely on his mental acuity more in these stories, and the humbling the Riddler gets at the end makes for a satisfying time.Just a quick note here (I've added this note to other tapes in this series I have reviewed)--while I think the Dini-produced animated Batman has been one of the hallmarks of 90s animation, I do not advise buying the tapes in this series because they are not recorded in SP mode. You will get fuzzy pictures and sound. It is a shame that these excellent programs do not get the packaging they deserve."
2,Demonstrating the Pulfrich effect,The dinosaur animation is rudimentary (nothing like 'Jurassic Park' or 'Walking With Dinosaurs') and the video quality variable. Mainly useful as a demonstration of the Pulfrich effect (darker images take longer to reach the brain): the 3D sequences are quite successful.
3,nice but fragile,"Beautiful plates and educational, unfortunately in my opinion is fragile and not allowed to use in microwaves."
1,romantic fiction,"If this piece of work was intended to be a fairy tale, then it is a success. If it was not intended to be a fairy tale, then it is not worth the paper it is written on."
1,Excellent Content but Defective DVDs,"I've ordered the 2nd season DVD set for my wife twice now. Both times at least one of the DVDs wouldn't load in our DVD player. I tested the player with a dozen other DVDs and the player works fine. We have the set from the 1st season and all those DVDs play fine. I have to assume it's the vendor. Maybe these are not new items? Not sure. But I'm very unhappy to have experienced the same problem with the same product from the same vendor twice now. Maybe we'll try another vendor somewhere else. I want to be very, very clear here: we are huge fans of the show. The content is wonderful, one of our all time favorites. And I don't blame Amazon (unless they are using a vendor they know isn't reliable). We do a lot of business with Amazon, including ebooks, books, clothing, photo paper and inks, a wide variety of products. I'll continue to buy from them. But not this DVD set for a 3rd time."
1,Defective item - Amazon won't replace it.,"I realize Amazon has a time limit on refunds and replacements, but I wonder if they expect customers to order the complete six seasons and watch every single episode immediately? I ordered and paid in good faith, and Amazon will not replace the set with a defective disk. Yes, a lot of time has gone by, but I have only now opened and watched this set for the first time, or attempted to watch it. I trusted Amazon to send me a new product in good condition, which is what I paid for. I might add that I have purchased several dozens of other books and DVDs from Amazon over time. This is a very poor way to treat a customer, and one who uses the Amazon Visa card. Or, former customer and former cardholder."
4,Commentaries are lacking ...,"I was disapointed with the commenteries on the season openers ""In the Shadow of two gunmen"". They added nothing to the story. I was hoping it would be more in depth with the story. It was more like having the guys over and made little chit-chat.The commentary on ""Noel"" was a lot better. It told the story behind the story."
5,West Wing Complete Season Packages are Wonderful,"I love this series and these packages. Being on the go, I do miss a lot of the shows when they originally air so this allows me to catch up. Although I am not politically in the same arena, the acting and the writing is wonderful, entertaining, and just plain fun to watch. My only issue is that they can't release the season packages fast enough and I'm just biting at the bit to get the Complete Third Season."
5,A gift for creating interesting characters,"I never watched The West Wing when it was actually airing. But during the last month or two, I've been making up for that. This is a great show to watch. Aaron Sorkin's writing is known for one very wonderful thing: the ability to create complex, multi-layered and intelligent characters who are also interesting. Watching these people interact together, especially the nonverbal interactions, is just fun. This isn't a show to watch if you like a lot of action. Mostly it's dialogue and walking around the office, first with one person and then with another. But if you enjoy seeing people interact, and it does not bore you to listen to a lot of conversation about ideas and politics, this is a show you should not miss. It's also kind of interesting to compare what happens on the show with how things are now. I like the stories that are explored, I like the people, and I really like seeing everything through the lens of the last ten years or so."
5,The West Wing Season 2,"We love using The West Wing to fill the void on evening when there's nothing on TV worth watching. We actually wore out our old copy of Season 2, so we're really enjoying the new copy."
5,It hit me close to home,"My son is high-functioning autistic and I choke up everytime I watch this episode about a loner in the Senate who follows a half-hearted attempt to get money for autism research and training added to a bill and who then filibusters to prevent the bill from passing without it.I recognize Senator Stackhouse as possessing character traits that are common in near-relatives of autistic children, and it is entirely realistic that a man like this would behave in exactly that fashion. This is one of those occasions on the show where you can feel good because of something politicians did."
2,West Wing 2nd Season,"The series is very good however not all of the disks played well on the dvd player. Am not sure what the problem is, but it is with these particular disks as all other disks play without a problem."
3,The Episodes are entertaining but one of the DVD's was defective and skips.,"The show is witty, informative and entertaining. However the second disk skips in episode twelve and sixteen."
2,"Don't get HD, buy the Standard Def THERE THE SAME","Don't get the HD one, buy the standard definition one. There the exact same quality and this is on a very fast Cable Connection so its not lowered quality due to bandwidth issues. Very disappointed."
5,Exceptional storyline,"""Shadow of a Gunman"" 1 and 2 tells the story of how the Bartlett team came together and how Bartlett won the nomination. Part two is very inspiring and emotional. If I say why it ruins the viewing experience. The storyline of these two episodes is excellent and the acting is wonderful. It is compelling, emotional and ties up and answers that really help in understanding the relationships of the cast, how they started and developed. It is one of the best of ""West Wing""."
5,The best television show...ever...even for Republicans,"If you're looking at this, then you obviously have season 1 and you know that this is the best television show of all-time. It sounds cliche, but you will laugh and cry in the same episodes. I always yearn for more when the black screen comes up at the end because the story lines are so interesting and the characters are so endearing. I consider myself a borderline republican and I still love this show. Most of the political issues are background to character development and the way the characters deal with those problems. Don't be frightened off if you are not a liberal; this show is for everyone.P.S. Season 5 is not ""The West Wing"". It is a show WITHOUT Aaron Sorkin and without any real merits. If that is you're only experience with TWW, then please check out Season 1 or 2. The first 4 seasons are incredible. My favorite is 4, but we all have to wait for that."
5,Incredible Fairytale That Comes Alive!,"I loved Marcus who is a seven-year-old on an adventure, Goldest the magical fairy frog in need of a friend, and the Young Black Panther. The characters in this fairytale come alive. The writing is well exectued, the imagination of the author is endless, and the plot is easy to follow. This book should appeal to children and adults as it is truly a delightful fairytale adventure."
1,Ok 293892 Plots,"This book is not all its cracked up to be. It begins to be hard to read when the Molars start trying get out of the cell to save the Tooth Fairy Princess. Its not a page turner. The dialogue of the 7 year old, seemed more like a 16 year old. This magical land was well described, and that's all I liked."
4,Lovely magical story,"I think this book is a truly magical adventure by a new writer. The characters are charming and the book is reminiscent of the work of C. S. Lewis with the characters being humorous ,droll and yet quite entertaining. I think this is a good story for children to enjoy...and perhaps just the thing for an adult to read who needs a little magic in his or her life."
1,crap,"I was disappointed already by the preface, after having expected so much from the book (it is widely referenced). This author does not recognise that there is a great variety of nosological categories that are treated by psychiatry, which cannot be justly claimed to have the same origin. Further reading convinced me that this author ""writes history"", literaly. It is an ideological work par excellence. His comments are apologetic for a bio-medical model and cynically dismissive against socio-psychological ones. Also, his understanding of some of the works he refers to, such as Foucault's, is disputable (he clearly makes the mistake Foucault warns against: history of knowledge independent of power relations). I regret to have bought the book."
1,Psychiatric hagiography,"This is an unbalanced, often inaccurate, and entirely adulatory history of psychiatry, masquerading as scholarship. Shorter finally lost me at the point where he describes ice-pick lobotomies, of which he is mildly diapproving, as an ""adventure."""
1,Shorter is a Pyscho,"Thus man is truly a psycho. He portrays himself as a doctor, and all he is is a medical historian covering up biowarfare experimentation that has affected thousands of citizens and the military, and denying them the medical help they need. Fibromyalgia, myalgic encephalitis, Gulf War Syndrome, etc. A truly arrogant sexist who has no authority to write about diseases, much less about women's diseases or difficulties such as menopause etc he knows nothing about and should not be allowed to write about as if he were some authority on the subject. And seeing as he is not a gynecologist, and knows nothing about woman he needs brain castration among other things. He said GWS (Gulf War Syndrome) didn't exist, and um he's wrong about that as well. He should be ousted, but then and again, follow the money trail...from medical schools Big Pharma, health insurance companies, NIH, CDC, congressmen... He is not a doctor of medicine, therefore he has not sworn to the oath, ""DO NO HARM."""
3,"Good book, but definitely a lot of opinion","I have this for my one of my psych classes at LSU. It's not terrible; there's a lot of information in it. However, Shorter does seem to put a lot of his own bias thoughts in it. Fortunately, I have a good professor, and as we went through the book, he would point out several things that he disagreed with or weren't necessarily true. It's not a bad purchase, just be sure to read it with caution. It's not a text book, so not everything should be taken factually."
2,Shorter's opinion on the history of psychiatry,"I really enjoyed the part of this book on the history of psychiatry. Unfortunately only about 60% of the book is on this topic and the rest consists of Shorter's unbalanced opinions. As a Psychiartic Registrar/resident slightly more simpathetic to the Biological approach, even I found this book extremely biased. Shorter's concrete style of reasoning makes him far more suitable to write a book on the history of surgery. The finer nuances and richness of the field of psychiatry is clearly outside his grasp."
2,a one-sided polemic,"This book is a one-sided polemic. The author clearly believes that only the ""biological"" approach to psychiatry is worth anything, but instead of presenting his case as an honest argument, he gives us a weighted, colored, and biased view of history. I was very disappointed."
2,Like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,"In my opinion, Mr. Dvorak has conducted this pieces so fast that the only good reason for it was to force them all into one CD( I haven't got any other record that has all 4 in 1)"
2,One guitar plenty of echos,"1. I would lie down in front of a train for leo kottke. He saved me from a life of bluegrass in the 70's. So anything I've gotten out of life after that accrues to him. I mean I could be in a jam band now or something.... um... I'm a lawyer...so maybe it didn't work out. Whatever...2. ""That's What"" is one of my favorite albums of his. That immediately and in and of itself makes me a suspect reviewer. So please disregard this review if you have strong feelings about Leo's legacy.3. I do not like this album. I suppose it's fair. In 30+ odd years a genius is bound to produce an egg.4. There's nothing on this CD. It's like cotton candy at the fair. There's echos of Mona Ray and a whole bunch of other tunes. But it's like they are just there winnowing themselves in the wind- mindless masturbatory ejaculations to himself. I hope this isn't his death knell. This really bothers me to say this. I feel like I'm voting for Bush or something.5. What do I know. I live in Boise."
3,Virtuosity yes...fun no,"Ok where to start...ah I've been a Kottke fan for almost 30 years now and own his entire catalog. Since his creative peak in the 70's he has produced an amazing body of work. I've heard him in concert more than once tell of his record labels wanting to pair him with a ""chick singer"", which at this point might not be a bad idea. The problem with much of this, is as one reviewer had previously some of the licks you do recognize from other songs. His best works (Great Big Boy, Ice Water, Greenhouse), included both instrumental tracks and vocal tracks. But more importantly they were fun. His previously release ""Clone"" while it took me awhile to warm up to, I appreciate more and more because it's a departure and fun. Certainly, the die-hard Kottke fan will probably find this more than enough to satisfy them but it just didn't do it for me. The songs just sound like they're going nowhere. I believe Leo has at least one more great release in him, unfortunately this isn't it."
3,I agree with riderz43,"I thought this cd would grow on me but there is way too much of the familiar kottke sound on this album. Every song sounds familiar like you know he did this riff somewhere else in another song, in a different key perhaps. There are some shining moments but if there is one thing Kottke cant do, its improvise. I get totally lost while he is getting lost on these tunes and just skip to the next song. Also, why does he need to keep tuning down lower on each successive album? Im hearing too much fret-buzz and dare I say sloppiness? He has that 12 string down 2 whole steps at least, possibly more. I love Kottkes music but cant find much more than a few songs here worth hanging on to."
3,"Great ideas, but difficult to follow","I was looking for a book on death anxiety and thought this book would be perfect. It presents some great perspectives on the issues that often underlie such anxieties. However I found her writing style difficult to follow as some of her ideas do not progress logically. Additionally she will often refer to previous people/events discussed in earlier chapters without any intro to ""jog"" your memory."
3,OTHER WISEFINE,I'M SURE THIS AUTHUR IS VERY INTELLIGENT.PERHAPS TO MUCH.SHE USES LANGUAGE THAT I VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAMD THE MEANING OF CERTAIN WORDS OR SENTENCES.IT WOULD BE BETTER APPRECIATED IF SHE WOULD USE TERMS THAT A COMMON PERSON COULD UNDERSTAMD.
2,Disappointed,I had already purchased JOHNNY CASH AT TOWN HALL PARTY and JOHNNY CASH THE ANTHOLOGY.This DVD was taken from both of them.The only song was diffrent was the last song.I was hoping to see something different. Not a copy of what I had already purchased on other DVD's.
1,RIP OFF,"Don't waste your money of this DVD. This is a cross between the Town Hall Party and the Anthology DVD. Don't fall for this cheap, worthless piece of garbage and buy the other Johnny Cash DVDs available."
2,Disappointing,"As a Johnny Cash-collector, I was looking forward to this DVD. Unfortunately, I was disappointed when first viewing it as it is a kind of copy and collection of other DVDs on the market. Most of its tracks are based on a release of Bear Family Records, Germany, titled 'At Town Hall Party 1958-59'. On the cover there's a notice 'This production is not authorized or endorsed by the estate of Johnny Cash'.However, if you don't own the DVD mentioned above, you will most likely like it."
1,The author hated his subject and it showed,"I wish I could give it zero stars or minus-20. Terrible book.BLENDER Magazine dubbed it THE Worst Rock Biography of all time, which is why I bought it off e-bay - just to see how bad it could be.It lived down to my expectations."
1,Hold your nose reading this one,"In this book Goldman maliciously sets out to destroy the reputation of Elvis Presley. This is not a biography in the traditional sense of the word, no; it is a vicious hatchet job.Through his persistently negative line of attack and dependence on unnamed or biased sources Goldman paints the ugliest portrait of Elvis imaginable. But he doesn't stop there. His depiction of Elvis's parents as the ""Beverly Hillbillies"" and his condescending reconstruction of the sort of gospel show that inspired the young Elvis could even be considered racist.In short, ""Elvis"" by Albert Goldman is a thoroughly despicable book, written IMO by a thoroughly despicable man -- hold your nose and read it at your own risk."
3,Evlis Paperback Songs,"This book is very helpful for the beginning player, particularly those who have a difficult time figuringout songs by ear. It includes ALL of your favorite Elvis songs. It is also very simple - this can be a great thing for some, and a disappointing thing for others. I used it to learn ""It's Now or Never"" on the ukulele. Good luck!"
4,"Very healthy lasagna, not bad but don't expect it as same as regular lasagna.","As long as you won't expect to taste as regular lasagna, this is pretty good as whole wheat lasagna. A bit gummy, different texture from the regular type, of course. For the health benefit with flaxseed, I can take it to substitute regular ones occasionally. One thing to point out is that one package may not be enough for traditional lasagna recipe."
2,okay,i got this after the reviews...The 7 minute cooking time really left my lasagna undercooked. Was a huge waste and ended up trying to fix it but in vain...I guess it needs longer cooking time that needs to be figured out well...but really dunno if it was me...considering this is whole wheat i should have realized. It really did not do well.
5,spaghetti,I like this brand. It doesn't taste like some healthy pasta. More like regular pasta in taste w/ all the health benefits.
3,They changed the material,"My first pair of these socks were made by Ultimax and they were heaven on my feet. I needed a cycling sock and this was very comfortable and cheap. The material was thin but not cheap. The material allowed my foot to breathe and didn't take up a lot of space in my shoe. I liked them so much I started to buy more of these to replace my everyday socks. Recently, the company WigWam started to manufacture these socks and the material changed slightly but was overall the same. The last pair that I bought in Dec of 2011, the material changed again this time being very puffy, not breathe-able, and not as slim in the shoe. I would not buy these again."
5,I like the sox.,"The Wigwam sox are comfortable, sleak, and they wick away any perspiration. Definitely recommended."
2,"Disappointing, but it has it's good points","As a fan of the Mage background since I've come across it (3 years previously), I would simply like to echo the concerns voiced so far. While some aspects of the system were improved, bringing Mage into line with 3rd edition Vampire, other aspects of gameplay were neglected (such as explanations of Resonance). However, I too find that the background has suffered horribly. Definately worth a look for new players, as finding 2nd edition will become more difficult, and perhaps worth it to veteran players simply for reference or a tool to perform their own conversion into 3rd edition rules.Enjoy!"
4,"Mage: The Complex, But Fun Game...","Before I had purchased this core rulebook, I was sure that it would be too hard to play (probably like many of you). Many of the roleplaying community stated their discomfort when playing the game. This discomfort was caused by not clear understanding of the rules. White-wolf and the authors should have made it clear that this game was intended to be concentrated on, more than the other world of darkness games. Other than that fact, I thought that this game was overall, pretty good. Like I said earlier, make sure that you are devoted and will study the game to clearly understand it, that way you will enjoy your puchase throughly."
5,Finally,"I've been involved with Mage since the release of First Edition. I've run it in all its incarnations, including several sets of confusing House Rules. Now, Mage 3rd revamps the magic system and makes it all work.Some may complain about the meta-plot - that's fine. But Mage has finally managed to capture the occult beliefs of different peoples, something it has always strived to do but fail throughout the years. This revision has helped the game immensely."
5,"Mage, third edition, is the best thing I've read in a while","I started off knowing little about the Mage universe, or much of White Wolf, the publisher either. Thanks to this book, as well as others, I AM HOOKED! The book skillfully outlines the basic story of the Mage universe, after the Ascension War is lost by the Traditions, and gives new readers a whole world, with spell ideas, great characters, and a whole of ""grey area"" for Storytellers to develop their Chronicles with skill and enthusiasm. There are those who don't like the new edition, as it is not as free with some areas as the previous editions were, but I have to say, if your looking for a great direction to take gaming, and are tired of primarily point based, systems, that leave less room for imagination, give this one a try. I also heartily recommend all of the other White Wolf products, for this line, as well as Vampire: the Masquerade, and Werewolf: the Apocolypse.Enjoy!"
1,Junk,"The writers obviously did not understand what Mage is all about. How I wish the writers of Mage 1 and some of Mage 2 were still writing for Mage in White Wolf.When you play in a ""World of Darkness"" you're playing a character that against all odds, in the end, will win, even though despair and darkness are around every corner. Or at least, someday, their cause might win, even if they do not. In this version of Mage, that 'hope' is gone. The Ascension War is lost, and all your character does is sneak around, living his or her little life. Not much of a higher purpose involved there.I haven't purchased the book, just flipped through it at a bookstore and looked at a friends. I wouldn't spend a dime on this travesty. I knew when they were writing it, from rumors that I'd heard, and an actual conversation with one of the writers, that this was not going to be very good, but it's actually downright horrible."
1,"You could just say ""No, you can't play a Mage.""","This book is an absolute piece of [junk] that is the ruin of Mage. I don't know what White Wolf was thinking when they put this together but it completely ruins the game as a playable system. The only possible chronicles that could come out of it are either Technocratic ones or Tradition ones involving the overthrowing of the Technocracy.It was a definate given that the Technocracy would eventually win the Ascension War, but it was altogether a concept that should have been left up to the Storytellers and players to decide. But this book gives no leeway in the World of Darkness for mage players to evolve any sense of creativity or spontanaeity without serious repercussions from paradox. And nobody likes that much.My suggsetion is that you just stick with the Second Edition rules and system and say the ]heck] with the Third. If you want a Technocratic ruled society, become a Storyteller and design your own."
3,Not as inventive as previous albums,"I didn't like this album as much as the other two that I own (Look Left and Quartet). This one is, to be blunt, very bland. I would have a hard time picking out the music from this album from anything played on a smooth jazz station. I could remember the songs on her previous two albums long after the CD ended. With this one they are gone before I hit the eject. It is not a bad album and makes nice background music but it doesn't stand out either."
5,if you want your baby to sleep BUY THIS!,"We bought this when our daughter was 2 months old. and it was part of her night routine!! she fall sleep in it EVERY TIME. plus it was the perfect place to put her after feedings or if we have guest or just doing chores around the house! this is by far our fav. baby gear product. however now that she's 7 months old, she doesn't like it as much because now that she can roll and sit she feels that it's restraining her. but we had to do it all again, we will buy it at a heart beat!! it gave us 5 months of happiness!!P.S. check other places you might find it cheaper."
2,To BIG buy a bouncer,I got this for my baby shower and was excited to try it out. It is way to BIG as well as expensive. I used my swing and bouncer much more than this. Save your money and buy a swing and bouncer. It will be money well spent.
1,Both children did not like it,"We got this as a present when my first son was born. We tried over and over again to put him in it but every time we did, he got fussy and cried. We'd move him to the swing, and he'd be happy and fall asleep. So...we put it away for our next child.We had our second son a few months ago and again, took this out. Again, just like our first son, our newborn didn't like it. We kept trying until our son was 4 months old and he never liked it. So...we gave it away."
3,Not worth the money,"I bought this in hopes to soothe my baby and was very disappointed. The motor in the glider broke within a few weeks of use, but I have to say that Fisher Price stepped up and is sending me a whole new piece. It is very loud when in use and there is nothing to entertain my baby. The motion does not calm her at all. I would say buy a swing instead."
4,Great glider,"At first we didn't think our little one liked this, but with persistance, we have been successful. He really enjoys it now. Works great when you need a minute to cook supper, clean something or fold clothes. He has even fallen asleep once in it. you can also attach links with toys the the bar for something for a little one to play with. This has been a very useful and helpful item in our house. Great quality, very comfortable. Highly recommend."
5,Great Product,"the seller didnt clean it up very well, so i had to. but it was exactly what i wanted. so overall i was satisfied. Baby loves it:)"
4,Great glider,"We started using this glider immediately with our baby. It doesn't take the place of us rocking her to sleep (she still prefers that), but it is very soothing to her. We don't always use the gliding function either. I like that it is small, portable, and not completely flat like her crib. She sleeps on a bit of an incline in this, and that helps her not spit up as often. My daughter is almost 3 months and I'm not sure how much longer we can use the glider- she's a little over 11 lbs. and she's getting a bit big for it. It's been very useful for us though. She wasn't quite ready for her crib right off the bat, and this has been a great alternative."
2,Great product . . too bad the motor died!,"We purchased this glider for our newborn daughter instead of a bouncer. It worked wonders for us, especially at night. By 3 weeks she was sleeping 7-8 hours at night in it. We were quite upset, however, when the motor that moves it back and forth died 6 weeks later. I called Fisher Price and they stated that it wasn't a common problem. I expected that I baby item that cost $70 would last a little longer."
3,Good while they are little,"This glider is great when you first bring the baby home and when they really don't care about being held all the time. I will say it is super easy to move room to room. It is nice that it pivots so you can have the baby go side to side or back and forth. It is easy to assemble and take apart for easy cleaning. But they do lose interest in it after a few months and you have to buy a swing anyway. But this served it's purpose, it also plays music that my son loved. So it was something that I would buy again."
3,"Great for sleeping, but eats batteries, mechanical issues.","This was a lot of fun for about 2 weeks. Sadly, it eats batteries and the motor dies frequently. Eventually, despite replacing batteries multiple times, it died completely. We've had the bouncer for 3 months and we only use it as a place for our baby to take naps now. He far prefers it to his crib as it cradles him cozily. He has slept up to 6 hours in it when swaddled, as opposed to 4-5 hours in his crib, but we're working on that. It is also somewhat bulky. Not happy with the extra ""features"" but love it as a temporary bassinet. The fabric cover machine washes easily."
1,INCREDIBLY noisy!,"I got this glider based on the tons of great reviews on Amazon, but was so, so, so incredibly disappointed when we got it. First of all, it's HUGE. Secondly, it's increeeeeeedibly loud. Not the song - the motors working. I couldn't believe it! We tried it two times with my son and he hated it. I couldn't fathom turning this on because of the noise. Try to go and hear it for yourself before you buy it.... perhaps if you're looking for white noise, this would work for you. I saw the dimensions on the site before I ordered it, but it's much bigger than I anticipated. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
2,"great idea, but...","What a great idea for a product! My son LOVES this glider, but after use the cloth has stretched out, allowing the fabric pocket at the bottom of the product to slip off of the bar. My son could have slipped through and been seriously injured by this product. I did contact the company, who claimed the product was not defective and offered me the option of purchasing a replacement cover for an additional cost. I was hoping the company would be a little more concerned about a potential problem with their product, so it loses stars based on entrapment risk and company customer service (or lack thereof)."
3,Infant seat/bouncer,"I love the looks of this seat, but the only thing that holds the seat to the base is 2- 1"" screws. My fear is that the weight of the base will come sdisconnected from the seat while carrying the seat with the baby in it, possing a fall/trip/injury risk."
4,Pretty and sweet.,"Haven't had the baby yet, but have played with this. Is is easy to set up. It does make a noise but a low mechanical noise, which may be soothing to baby. I'm not sure if it is suppose to make that kind of noise. It is not as noticable with the music going. It moves steady and slow. I think baby will like it, I hope. I rated it 4 because of the noise."
2,Not what I expected,"This was a gift given to me before the birth of my 4th child. It's well built and sturdy but just doesn't do the job. The glider is way too slow to lull my baby to sleep. For the price, is just isn't worth it."
4,Glider,"I haven't gotten to use this yet, but it seems to be great. I put it together alone (7 months pregnant) and it took no time at all. Very easy. My only complaint is that it is quite large! It is as big as out bassinet! Still, much smaller than a swing so that is good. My 2 year old has climbed into it once and it did not tilt over or anything like that. Very sturdy base! This should keep the new little one safe from big sister trying to dump him out of it! Can't wait to see how he likes it, but so far we do!"
5,Great for baby's who have trouble sleeping in crib,"Our child has gerd and has been unable to sleep lying flat since birth. This chair has been a lifesaver. The head is elevated in this chair so there is no need to worry about your child spitting up and choking in his sleep. The chair feels sturdy but the part the baby lies in is soft, it gently wraps around your baby and literally rocks them to sleep. The glider does make noise while gliding and at first I found it annoying....that was before I realized the sound drowns out the other sounds in the house that might wake the baby in it's sleep. Worth every penny!"
5,Works like a dream,"We bought this to be more like a bed for our baby because she seemed to have some congestion when we laid her down flat. She slept 6 hours the first night in it at 5 weeks old. It lays better than a bouncy seat and cuddles them in it. I am sure the motion part is great, but for now, we just use it as a bed and love it."
1,P.O.C,"First off my newborn son hated this glider, my wife and I also disliked the glider. This glider took up to much floor space, and was to heavy which made it difficult to move it from room to room. our son grew out by 4 months. We hardly used the glider, maybe 7 times, and now its broken. this was a complete waste of money !"
3,Not real wood,I ordered the Oak/Black table instead of the Black/Black option because I was looking for a table top that matched my solid oak floor and furniture. I spent a long time searching for a laptop table that was not made with fake wood and thought I had found it so I am pretty disappointed. The words 'style' or 'laminate' would have let me know this was not a real wood top.The mechanics are very nice and smooth and the table is very stable - just disappointed in the laminate top so I'll have to make my own REAL wood top. If you don't mind about the laminate then I would recommend this pneumatic table - purchase the Black/Black model if you are offended by laminates.
1,Back to the store....,"This toy took a verrrry long time to set up, load batteries and sticker. What a big waste of time!! The thing never worked right and my son was major disappointed. I'll think twice about a Hot Wheels toy next year."
1,Bad choice!,"I should have listened to the previous reviews, but my five year old son persisted. (This toy was his top choice for Christmas). He has 50-75 cars and not one would go through the booster chamber. This toy is going back to the store for a refund. For the price this toy should work perfect, but was a great disappointment on Christmas morning."
2,very disappointed,"I GOT THIS FOR MY 5 YEAR OLD SON FOR CHRISTMAS. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. FIRST--SLIME IS A VERY BAD IDEA FOR CARPETS, BUT IT DRYED UP AND HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY WITHIN 48 HOURS. IT CAME WITH NO CARS AND TO FIND A CAR TO WORK IN IT IS LIKE FINDING A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK. THE CARS FALL OFF ALMOST EVERY TIME THEY TRY TO TAKE A CURVE. THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS RIGHT IS THE ROBOT TALKING. I PLAN ON RETURNING THIS. I HAVE BOUGHT OTHER HOTWHEELS TRACKS AND HAVE NOT LIKED ANY OF THEM. THE OLD TRACKS THAT USED GRAVITY WERE BETTER."
3,It's OK,This was the #1 toy requested in 2001 by my 4 year old son. It's easy to set up and use and works well and the pieces don't get lost but he quickly lost interest and hasn't played with it in months. I had a hard time finding it last year and had to pay...for it but right after Christmas the stores had stacks of them for ...
2,75 stickers ?,"Hot wheels should stick to die cast cars. This cyborg city is a horrible piece of junk. When I asked my son what he wanted for Christmas, the only thing he said was the cyborg. After weeks of trying to figure out what that meant, I saw the commercial. Right away I knew this was never going to work. After tearing it open on Christmas morning, my wife began to apply the 75 or so stickers. An hour later... The track snapped together easily enough. I pulled out my son's box of hotwheels. Out of about fifty cars, only 2 would actually make it around the track correctly. This toy will probably make it to the spring cleanup pile in a couple of months. Don't waste your money or time with this."
1,Look elsewhere for style and comfort,"I wonder if the other reviewer and I looked at the same book. I found the photos to be outdated. The style was a by way of the 80's and I'm not talking cool retro. So, I did not find the book to be very inspiring. I was hoping for it to have more of an Arts and Crafts feel, or be along the lines of the Not So Big House series, which I recommend instead of this book."
3,"Not great but better than one and two,","I'm one of those types who enjoys a good post-apocalyptic flick every now and then so this movie appealed t me on that level at least. It's far superior than the second, by leaps and bounds really and I enjoyed the plot more than the previous two. The movie had many flaws and it won't appeal to everyone but it does make up a bit for how bad the second one is. It's your typical B Horror movie with a touch of sci-fi for added effect. If you're bored and want to watch something mindless and somewhat entertaining then you could do worse. While the second installment of the Pulse trilogy earned a solid one star or perhaps no stars if that was an option this one at least qualified for two or three."
1,Barely better than Pulse 2,"Because everyone was just clamoring for another sequel to Pulse, Pulse 3 is here, and suffers from all the problems that made Pulse 2 practically unwatchable. Picking up years after Pulse 2, Pulse 3 finds the grown up Justine (Brittany Finamore) traversing back to the haunted city in search of the mysterious Adam (Rider Strong). In terms of plot, that's about it in a nutshell, as Pulse 3 features more spectacularly awful green-screen effects work, an incoherent and non-sensical story, and one of the most annoying and unlikable ""heroines"" you'll see today. With an uber-confusing ending, hopefully this is indeed the end of the Pulse series, and perhaps Joel Soisson can move on and craft more films that are pretty well close to being an insult to the horror genre. Avoid."
1,"Save yourself, never mind Adam!","Oh good grief.The most amazing thing about this film is that a girl isolated from technology instantly knew how to type.Poor Texas, designated as a dead zone for this movie.As for the plot this time out, a dreary girl takes a long dreary trek to get to Houston to save some guy named Adam. She gets chained along the way, runs into the red guy from film 2, and finds out the hard way what it's liked to be duped (goodness knows, I felt the same way after snorkeling my way through this final entry in the Pulse franchise).I'm just so grateful that it is over and I don't ever have to watch these three films again, ever (as in never!)."
1,PLS DON'T EVEN BOTHER PURCHASING!,"Rented this movie from my local library, and so glad I did, because it was such a waste! I'm glad I did not purchase this DVD."
5,Get a life,I find it very funny! I think it is saying I am cured from schizophrenia but now I have MPD and the one saying it does not realize it. I personally will buy it if for no other reason than to upset the above reviewers. Yes we all know mental disorders are not funny but come on we have to laugh at ourselves and all the obstacles we are faced with in life. Maybe that's why people go crazy. Because they can't laugh at all life throws at us. Get a life stop taking everything so serious. Especially the serious things.
4,Very pleasing,"The liner notes say he studied with Ireland and was influenced by Sibelius. Really? I hear the sweetness of the former, but not the Scandinavian's complexity. Instead, I hear a man who delighted in being a sponge and integrater (ok, not a word, but it should be). There is Debussy, Faure and even Smetana here, but always with a kind of British crispness overlaid. When he goes folk, he looks west across the Atlantic, not over his shoulder at the Slavs. That keeps the piece dreamy, but reformist. The G Major is a special kind of synthesis of compositional strengths and will stay with you for some time (the Adagio presages a significant theme in Shosti's 8th St Qt). The playing is critical here, since the pieces, often gently romantic, might easily go mushy without the interpreter's respect. Maggini does it right. And those liner notes mention a Cello Concerto written for the composer's wife. Back to the shopping cart we go; in for a nickel . . ."
1,The book title could not be further from the truth!,"In preparing for the GRE, I had access to three different prep books. This was by far the worst. It is riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, and the illustrations are very poor and difficult to decipher. I got this book because it includes three practice tests, but I found over 20 factual errors in either the questions or answers in the practice tests (and those were just the ones I caught! I hate to think about how many there were that I didn't catch). Many of the questions were unclear and grammatically problematic, so that much of my time was spent simply trying to figure out what the question was trying to ask.This book needs an editor badly! As it is, it is a crime they take money for it. As far as I am concerned, you would be better off not buying a book at all than buying this piece of [stuff] and receiving bad information."
1,WORST review book.,"This was far and away the absolute worst review book I have ever seen for anything. It was full of poorly worded questions with even worse answer explanations. Tons of spelling and grammatical errors and other mistakes, like an answer being listed with the wrong letter. Is the letter or the answer correct? Who knows? These people need an editor, or need to go back to grade school. I can't believe they publish this book without spell checking it. Very frustrating to attempt to study out of this. Completely useless and a waste of valuable study time."
2,Not a great review book..,"As the previous review mentioned, this book is full of errors of various sorts. Some sections of it repeat almost verbatim other sections, while some sections gloss over important bits entirely. The entire section on plant biology is only 10 pages long. If you think you might need to know anything about plants, try another book. The diagrams aren't very helpful either. There are better Biology review books out there. Try ""Biology Made Simple"" by Rita Mary King for a very basic overview of biology or try ""Biology The Easy Way"" from Barrons which is much more in depth."
1,Horrible horrible horrible book,"I don't even know where to begin with this book. Its written in granny print so just because the book looks huge and full of information its because the font is big enough for you to read from 10 feet away. Has very little information and this is evident when you start taking the ""practice"" exams in the back of the book. Sure they explain the answers but you wouldn't be able to find any of them in their so called ""comprehensive"" review. The practice tests are full of spelling, grammar, and answer errors. The tests don't even closely resemble the format of the GRE practice book. In the practice book from ETS there are approximately 40 questions based on data analysis, the tests in this study book contain 4. This book was a rip-off. Shame on the publisher for releasing such an unrefined piece of crap."
3,Get your moneys worth,"For the price of the shorts you can't beat it, you definitly get your moneys worth."
5,American Warriors Highly Recommended,"In his year-end column for World War II Magazine, book review editor Robert Citino selected American Warriors as one of the best World War II books of the year. I agree. History books should be informative, accurate and readable; American Warriors is all of these and more. The author brings to light the military careers of five of our recent presidents, highlighting their naval service in the Pacific. Extensively end-noted, American Warriors draws on interviews with more than 100 veterans who served with the presidents as well as on a comprehensive bibliography of primary sources. Folklore has no place in this well-researched book. Presidential scholars will find it a dependable resource; more casual readers will find it swift paced and enjoyable. I highly recommend American Warriors."
2,you get what you pay for!!!!,"I do not recommend this product. It is not very good quality. Mine came with a small grey mark on it and one of the embroidered flowers is done in thread that is an orange shade, as if they loaded the wrong thread in the machine but didn't take the time to go back and fix the mistake. Also, one of the shams has a yellow stain on the back of it. I am using it as a blanket under a really nice comforter that I remove at night whenI go to bed, so these problems don't bother me and the shams and the bedskirt are not being used. The price I paid is much cheaper than if I had purchased another blanket for my bed. So for my purposes this comforter is ok, but I would never use this as the top comforter on my bed."
2,disapointed.,Item arrived snagged and soiled. Quality not as nice as expected.Not worth cost listed at.
1,Stained,"This set came the very next day after ordering & I was so excited. Upon opening it my delight turned to dismay. The comforter had several large stains that looked like sewing machinge oil. The color was perfect & had it not been for the stains, it would have been well worth the $$. In fact a bargain...but not dirty."
4,pretty and inexpensive!!,"Very pretty set. Not real eyelet, but it has the look of eyelet - for the price, it's a nice looking set. I can toss it when I get tired of it, and not feel guilty about spending too much money."
3,My Review,"I received this product in a timeley manner. The only thing I was highly disappointed with after recieving them was that they are the locking kind, and I dont like that. I read the description before ordering, and nothing said that they were locking. Disappointing.... But I still use them anyway."
5,Tim Kasher is genius.,"Honestly, The Good Life is outstanding when it comes to lyrical talent, and voice. Tim Kasher, I believe, has one of the most amazing vocalists in the music business. This CD, Black Out, in particular is unbelievable. The lyrical content is so unique and it's like every sentence has a story behind it, one that so many people can relate to. I was actually struggling through a family relationship at the time I bought the CD, and the track `Don't Make Love So Hard` kind of helped me through that time. I really feel as if anybody could enjoy The Good Life, and relate to the deeper meaning within the lyrics. I would definitely suggest this CD to anybody who enjoys Cursive, Bright Eyes, or Planes Mistaken for Stars' softer stuff."
5,Prime Example of Omaha Talent,"A little biased here in Omaha, NE, but have to say that this is the best ALBUM that I've heard all year. Saw The Good Life at the Sokol about a month ago and had goose bumps the entire show. The album offers much the same. Kasher is certainly expressing some deep emotions and does it very well. I just hope I get a chance to see them live once again. SUGGESTION: BUY THIS ALBUM!"
3,Best when focused in it's lovely misery,"3 1/2 starsBetter incorporation with his electronic tendincies lends itself to some beautifully creative moments. We are still dealing with moments though, as Kasher is willing to ride out whatever varied influence he would like to incorporate, for better or worse..When this works best is when he is at his most sincere, which most would say is always since he is as bleeding heart as it gets. However, I refer to the sincerety of his songwriting, not his lyrical content. When he pulls directly for the heartstings through his gutair strings-minus as much pretense as he can muster, his songs resonate so much longer then when he wonders out into mere excercises in his miserable recording genius. His art has always walked this fine line, between the beautifully articulated sonics of emotional fraility, and the caving in to the language of songwriting that emotional fraility entails. Here is to the former illuminating the latter.."
4,Pieces of the Heart - Amateur at its best and worst,"Simply put, this is amateur poetry at its finest but also at its worst. I'll refrain from naming titles, but quite honestly some of these are very amateurish and probably should not have been published. However on the up side, poems of that nature do not make up much of the book. If you're expecting to find only romantic poems in a book with a title like ""Pieces of the Heart,"" then you've not yet learned that a book is not to be judged by its cover or title alone. There is great range in the style and content of the poetry in this book, ranging from the romantic to downright haunting (Schizophrenia, My Last Night). On a lower note, this book has a pretty hefty price tag, but it is probably well worth the money to the poets featured as well as to the die hard amateur poetry fanatic."
5,another great berenstain bear story,got this for my granddaughter who loves the berenstain bear storiesit was a valentine giftshe loved it when i read it to her the same day wemade Valentine cookies
1,Impossible to open,This cup is impossible for myself and my husband to open! We were only able to use this cup once since it never opened again. I have a friend who is having the same problems with this cup.Also it is not what we were looking for it is to spill proof I was looking for a cup to transition from the playtex straw cups to a regular cup. I wish we had removed the valve before giving it to my daughter.
4,Not for coffee,"I ordered this to protect my MAC PRO from my coffee after a mis-hap. It is Great for cold drinks, not meant for hot. Naturally, it is for kids. What was I thinking?Also, I was amazed how hard you need to suck on these cups to get your liquid out. Babies are strong! I love the ""spill proof"" feature and use it with cold drinks. Someone else commented on the small amount that may drip out of the mouthpiece. I learned that if I blow back into the mouthpiece after drinking from it. I don't know if you can teach a toddler to do this.The cup does everything it promises."
2,They leak when thrown.,"Most toddlers will throw a cup now and then and these leak when they do, period. I prefer the Gerber/NUK brand for not leaking."
2,It Leaks,"I ordered these cups because my elderly mother frequently knocks over her drinks. They are nicely insulated and fit the hand well. However, when knocked over they leak. Granted, when they hit, only a couple of drops fly out. But if left on their side they seep liquid. It also takes a lot of effort to sip the drink. I am returning them because they are advertised to be 100% leak-proof and do not solve the problem of spilled beverages."
2,Like the old lids better,"We have a few of the older version of this cup and really like them. But the new locking mechanism thing is annoying. I have a hard time getting them open and when my kids are screaming for more water or milk, it's super frustrating. I wish they had not changed the cups."
1,Style Vs Safety,"I bought these sippy cups after I saw that my daughter's daycare used them and how much her daycare provider raved about them. I love that they are insulated, cute, and especially that they are actually spill proof.After and emergency room visit with my 18 month old this past week my opinion on these sippy cups have drastically changed. I no longer care if a sippy cup is cute, insulated or, spill proof. All I care about is that it is safe for an active toddler to use.My little girl while scooting off her seat (low height) fell catching herself with her hand that held the sippy. The sippy ended up breaking the skin under my daughter's jawline so bad that she needed 2 layers of stitches-a total of 15 stitches.I know the possibility of this happening again is probably slim to none but I felt the obligation as a mom to let otherr parents whose little ones use these sippies or are thinking of getting them are just aware of a possible safety issue with this sippy and an active toddler."
5,Glorious one pot meals,It's my new method of cooking--great pot to go with the recipe book in the title.
3,One book wonder...like J.K. Rowling,"It's too bad that when an author writes their first book, that book companies insist they drag out writing into a whole series...when there is only story enough for one book. This is the case with the Magickers series. The first book is special and well-written...those that follow are a waste of time for the reader...very repetitive and boring. Like J.K. Rowling who only had one or two books in her quiver, this author has the same problem. Stretching them out doesn't add to the story."
2,A wannabee J.K. Rowling!!,"This book was so lacking in creativity and imagination from the writer. Just to give anyone an idea of what I mean, she has 3 main characters, 2 boys and a girl. The girl is the smartest, one boy a bit nerdy, and the other eats a lot!! Sound familiar to anyone who has read Harry Potter! Instead of a mark on the boys head, as in Harry Potter, the boy in this story has a mark on his hand. In J.K. Rowlings books, the evil is referred to as the ""Dark Lord"", in this series, they are called the ""Dark Hand"". Also, there is a dragon in the 3rd book, that has absolutely NO bearing on anything in the story whatsoever so what is the point of putting him into the story at all? I was VERY disappointed with this series and would NOT recommend it to anyone. I am surprised it was even published. Emily Drake is definitely just a J.K. Rowling wannabee. Don't waste your time!"
2,NOT such a good book,"I bought this book because I had read a review elsewhere that said it wasn't just a Harry Potter rip-off. Well, that's debatable, but I found it disconnected, illogical, and boring. Maybe it's ok if you have absolutely NOTHING else to do."
4,Good summer read....,This was a fun book. Imagine Harry Potter as an American kid at summer camp and you've pretty well got the idea. The ending left room for a sequel and I'm curious to see what Emily Drake does with that.
1,Sony batteries are VERY disapointing,"This is the fourth in a series of batteries that I have gotten for the two Vaios I own. They barely last the year and the performance drops to less than half. I dont know if it is the charge circuits or the battery, but I have never seen such terrible performance. Although I like most Sony products, I will be avoiding Sony laptops in the future."
2,bad copy,the book was delivered promptly however the downside was that the book was copied in the opposite direction... similar to a book printed in Japan.
3,Device and Vista 64 bit.,This device will not work with 64 bit Vista out of the box. You need to download a the WIDCOMM Blue tooth software from Broadcom corporation.The driver is a free software download. After installation it works as described. Would be nice if it was noted someplace that it doesn't work with 64 bit Vista.
2,Does NOT work with Vista,"There was no indication that this product would not work with Vista. I wanted to use it to send audio to my BT headset or to my BT receiver connected to my stereo. I'm sure it works great with some other operating systems. Jabra Tech Support said to keep checking their web site for an update. After 3 months, there is still no sign of a Vista driver, even though many other products have been upgraded to support Vista."
5,Excellent Product - Needs Windows Vista Upgrade,"I bought this dongle to pair it with my A2DP ""Stereo"" Motorola HT820. When I received it, I connected with my headset.First, the sound comming out was in ""mono"" channel. it results that the WIDCOMM driver in the CD, is not compatible with Windows Vista, so you have to go - download - and RUN the driver directly from the Broadcom website, otherwise is not going to work in ""stereo"" mode.Once you have that installed in your Vista, you can listen in STEREO which is amazing... If you have Win XP, you don't need the driver from the website. That took me 3 DAYS for figure it out!!!! since they don't say in the ""installation manual"" the incompatibility with Vista so, if you read this, you might save some time...It has worked perfectly with others devices such as Phones and hands-free. Overall this is a Great product."
3,Was not completely impressed,"I kinda expected more out of this, the software has a lot of features but it's kinda cumbersome for me. Even if I connect a headset to my A320 I still have to go in and activate what I want on it. Also I told it to not take a passkey but it does anyway. Connecting the device is always a 5-15 minute hassle depending on how lucky I am. It's not very fluid and it just takes too much time to connect the device...but once you got it connected it works very well, as long as you have a good headset to go along with it. All in all...it's an okay product for my use."
4,"works well but,",No linux drivers so I can't use i on my laptop. It works great on my xp desktop though. I can't comment on vista. Good audio quality.
5,Works so well I forget its even there.,I have had this product for awhile now and have not had a single problem with it.
2,"Jabra fine, software drivers messy","Jabra a320s Bluetooth Adapter I just installed this USB adapter with driver and Jabra bluetooth headset. The installation proved to be not customizable. It installed support files for devices that I don't have and will never use. Irritates me that I can't get rid of them. Nor can I, (and this is purely cosmetic / preferential / minimalist) get rid of that whoppingly bright blue desktop icon that really doesn't need to be displayed in order for the device to work. Functionally speaking, keeping the headset paired is problematic. Frustrating, plus it's been a while, and still no technical support response from either Broadband/Widcomm or Jabra (although in fairness Jabra gets another business day before they're ""late"") regarding either the configuration or the connectivity issues. There are other solutions, I'd suggest checking them out before choosing this product."
1,jabra give no drivers support for a320s,"I was somewhat satisfied with this device until I needed a driver and didn't have the CD. As someone else commented, they do not have the drivers available online. I would advise anyone needed a bluetooth device of any kinda to look elsewhere.NOTE: I have only written maybe one or two product complaints in my whole life. Lack of software support with a device that is new on the market is a huge error in my book."
2,Is it becoming a legacy product?,"This product worked fine with Windows XP Pro and Vista Enterprise (32 bits) only after the Jabra driver was installed. I bought this dongle for a lot of money ($50) last year so that I could make full use of the Jabra headset.Now I have a Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bits OS and there seems to be no driver for this! I really distrust all those external driver sites, if there is one thing I don't want is to install a kernel level driver from an untrusted source.In their site they have a ""Windows Vista Update"" but they don't mention if you have to install the regular (old) version plus the update or just the update. They also fail to mention if that works with Windows 7, even so, would it work with a 64 bit version or just the 2 bit?I would say, if you have Windows 7 better look for something else unless you want to wait until hell freezes over."
1,No Windows 7 64 bit support,"Enough said. Company must be trying to ""dump"" their stock of A320s. Will send back if possible, if not try to find someone with a w95 system."
1,Keep far away if you have Windows 7,We could not get product to install properly on Windows 7 PC. If you go to the Jabra website they do not even list this as their product and hence it has zero support from Jabra. No Windows 7 driver seems to exist. Don't purchase this product at all costs.
5,funniest book I have ever read,My 4 yr old daugter found this wierd book in the library 1 day and I could not stop the laughter. I now have my own copy and several family members who have read have ordered as well. Great book. but not for the faint of heart.
1,poor message,"I found a pop-up book version of this at my local library. I don't enjoy potty humor, but being the parent of a 3-year old boy, I know I'm going to have to tolerate it. I couldn't care less about the fact that the book is about poop, and more power to you if it was a vehicle for opening discussion with your children about bodily functions as some reviewers have indicated.The reason I really disliked this story is that the ""hero"" gets pooped on, then once he thinks he's identified the culprit, he proceeds to retaliate in kind. That is bad enough, but that he does so without confirming guilt and while the other animal is sleeping sends the wrong message."
1,*Sigh* Whatever happened to class in children's books?,"Am I alone in lamenting the loss of class from children's popular literature? Seriously, the plot of this story is:1. Someone takes a dump on a mole's head.2. He searches for the culprit, examining a lot of different animal crap on the way.3. He finds the culprit and takes a dump on his head in revenge.I weep for the future."
1,Not good,Hi.I payed for the new book but got OLD one!!! The book has a staines on the pages and the cover is scratched.The story is very nice and funny.But I will never but from this person again.Do not reccomend this seller!!!
3,Quirky.,"This is not a 5 star or 4 star book. Make no mistake.With that said, it is a little kid's book, and short as all hell. The pictures are sure to charm any kid. The mole is looking for the culprit who has took a dump on his head (hint, rhymes with dog). Just a silly kid's book."
5,Rolling on the floor,The story of the little mole who went in search of whodunit is absolutely hilarious! Roll on the floor funny. My children as well as my grand children absolutely loved it! It's just pure silly. If you want to laugh with your children this is a must have.
5,Recommended by Ina May Gaskin,"At a recent maternity conference renowned midwife Ina May Gaskin recommended this book to us. She loves its humor. She uses it to relax mothers during labor and to help pregnant women who are thinking about birth. The humor helps mothers get over their hangups about poop. So, have a little poop humor!"
4,Wonderful in any language!,"I just translated the Dutch version of this book for my niece, before a friend pointed out that it's available in English. In any language it's one of the most delightful children's books available!"
5,milk running out your nose funny!,"I purchased the German language version of this book in a little out of the way bookstore in Berlin, belly laughing as I thumbed through the pages. In any language, this tiny text is a priceless gem of hilarity. Yes, its potty humour, but the illustrations and story line will make the most serious readers laugh until their tummys hurt. The book is money well spent."
4,"great book, good condition","This book was shipped to me very quickly, and was in very good condition, with a small amount of highlighting."
2,Like quality older sounding stuff but this is nothing specially at all.,Really thought one song outstanding and the rest blah or not worth listening to. Was disappointed as expected more from given the ratings especially from such a large band.
1,Incomplete Recording,"The disc's title is misleading--someone has cut (removed) the opening words (""He began..."") of Joyce's classic 'Ulysses' recording."
4,Show her colors.,"This is an excellent reference book, especially for the modeler who wishes to enhance his kit or scrath built model by building it as it would have appeared during a specific time period. Up until now I had no idea that there had been so many Gallery changes on this ship. And, that because it was a ""war ship,"" and no one was thinking of making it into a museum some day, its Captains would update it with the latest equipment and change its appearance according to their particular needs and desires.One thing that changed every time it was rebuilt or updated, was the colors of any paints used. I wish the author had addressed that the best he could.All in all, a good purchase and a compliment to my ever growing nautical library."
2,A book for children?,"Martin Gardner is an excellent writer and his other books have been a delight to read. Perhaps I would not have expected as much from this book if it had been labeled as being written for the 8 to 12 year old. Very young magicians are likely to enjoy this, but most adults interested in ""mental magic"" will probably be disappointed."
4,A Fun Book,"A fun book for young Magicians, also has some ideas that can be food for thought for older Magicians to develop and put into their shows. A great value considering the high price of a lot of Magic books these days. --L Betz"
5,i loved it. i hate to read and i actually read it in 3 days!,"this book was the best book i've ever read, and if you know me you know that i hate to read. But once i picked up this book i couldn't put it down, i was awake at 1am reading, i didn't want to go to sleep! This story seemed so real to me. i see these things described in the book happen everyday. I loved the discriptions of the weather, the town, the smells, the feelings. i felt like i was really there. i loved this book and i hope you do too!"
4,Gangs are all the same,"This story is about a hispanic gang and a girl's problems withthe death of her best friend and the turmoil with her mom. She'sinvovled with a gang and they drink and smoke all night, but after her friend gets killed she wants revenge. ""Dreamer"" is what everybody calls her b/c she's always dreaming and Ana (her best friend) gets killed in a drive-by by a sawed-off shotgun. I liked the book but I thought it was too short and I think Kata should've gone through more tribulations and troubles. But besides that I thought this book was good."
4,A related to life book,"This book was sad and mournful. It was about a girl trapped in the Gang life, and it had small realtions to me and my friend, Ferny, this is no beach read. It was because her freind got killed in a shoot out, her life started to turn into trash, but she wanted something more...............Am i saying to much?"
5,Great Read!,"Kata must face life without her friend Ana when Ana loses her life in a drive-by. Now she must choose--revenge Ana's death and remain part of the gang or face any equally uncertain future once she quits ""the life"". Choosing is not as obvious as you think. Lynn Ewing gives a voice to any teen struggling to come to grips with a life-changing decision. The characters are memorable, the portrayals of street life realistic and the story thought-provoking."
3,Some Classics,"There are classic tracks on this, though not all of it is going to be favourites of mine. I got it for Bach's Minuet in G by Christian Pezold - which is very hard to find, despite being one of those pieces you'd probably know if you heard it.It's a good collection, well-played. Recommended if you're into classical piano."
4,Good stuff...,I thought these tapes were very good. The humor is excellent and helps those who have difficulty accepting that they have an anger problem. I've listened to them at least 5 times already and I've only had them a month. These tapes sell for at least $50.00-$70.00 at Career Tracks. The prices here are incredibly cheap. They are definitely worth the money if you have an anger problem. You can't get this advice in a therapy session for this price.
1,Book on Big Sky Country a big pig sty,"The Wagon's West series fell flat in a story that is suppose to take place in Montana but actually keeps the reader in nevernever land. If you are a big fan of the series, skip this one and go on to the next one. You'll never know the difference."
4,"Nice storage device, no on/off switch","Nice drive, very easy to use. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because it does not have an on/off switch."
5,Anne Stuart's Out of Print Gems,I've got say because of the one review this collection got I almost missed out on some of the BEST books I've read in a long time! Just the first story alone (Night of the Phantom) would have been worth the money; but each story is so unique and wonderful! Characters are so well put together and each story fun and exciting and different from the one before it. I have thoroughly enjoyed this collection. If you love Anne Stuart then this is her at her BEST! Don't let yourself miss out!
4,Great stories at a great price,I have thoroughly enjoyed this collection and my best stories were The Valentine and The Soldier and the Baby. However all the stories were good and I highly recommend this collection
4,Great Knits - Review,"This is another typical book from Threads - a joy to own and read time and again. The instructions are not for the beginner, but the photos are wonderful and it is a great source of inspiration for your own designs."
5,Worth Reading,Excellent Book! Very easy read but deep thoughts.. Would recommend to anyone! . . . . . . . .
5,Total agreement!,"I can add absolutely NOTHING to ""A Music Fan's"" review other than to say I wore the record out listening to it back in 73/74. My son, who is now 31 years of age, could sit for an hour with the headphones on listening to it seemingly mesmerized rocking back and forth on the sofa.I couldn't wait for his subsequent recordings but ultimately found them wanting as it seemed he sidestepped his roots and original soulful stylings to appeal to a broader audience. Unfortunate. This, his first album, was without a doubt his best.I had the good fortune to see him perform on a late night TV program around the time this album was released. He was dressed in his clown personna. I was absolutely captivated. The showman's, showman.Again, congratulations to ""A Music Fan"" for his or her ability to put down in words what so many of us feel toward Leo Sayer's first and best effort."
4,WEdnesday 13' second solo album,"THis is an awesome album.If your looking or the motley crue sound o the murderdolls,or the alice cooper sound of Transylvania 90210,you wont find it here.This album does have one thing for the fans though,It has a return to the Maniac Spider Trash and FDQ13 days,both image wise.Is this a better album than Transylvania? No. Do I listen to it more than Transylvania? Yeah.I would recomend this album to any rock fan not ofended by horror movies,monsters,and necrophilism"
2,a hit and miss,"ok i will be honest i love W13 but this record.....naw i was'nt impressed by it i had it's moments with me but i really didnt like this one but maybe its me but i guess i expected more from this one dont let what i say encourage you from buying this one everyone has their opinion and this is mine but it was alright if you are a die hard fan of W13 go head and buy it but if you are if-y than i would go for 'Skeletons""."
5,Love it! Love it! Love it!,"I have been a huge Wednesday 13 fan for many moons and I have anxiously awaited this album. It definately has a punk feel to it, but there are still shades of metal in there. In particular, the song ""Haddonfield"" reminds me so very much of the great Alice Cooper. I will say that the previous album, Transylvania 90210, is still my favorite simply because of its heavy metal focus...that and hearing Wednesday request a bucket of chicken for Christmas is a scream!Of course, there's plenty of word play (some of the lyrics are absolutely hysterical) and more than enough mention of blood, dead bodies, and 80s horror movies. What more could a metal head ask for?!And what's not to like about Wednesday? He's hot, he's got the perfect voice for metal, he never lets his fans down, and he's one of the only metal singers that can say the phrase ""warm and fuzzy"" and have it competely rock. Now THAT is what a real artist is!!!"
3,"Good, while not his best work.","What the people are saying is correct, this is more punkish than past albums. Personally, I don't care for punk, so this review might not be for you. But Wednesday 13 always had a taste of punk in previous albums, but also included very heavy/catchy rythms.When I heard the first track ""Morgue than Words,"" I immediately got disappointed. I was hoping the rest of the album was not this lame. Thankfully, it's not. Tracks 2,3, and 4 will make sure you're going over the speed limit while headbanging. Track 6 is personally my favorite track, kind of depressing but helps me on those somber days.However, besides tracks 2,3,4, and 6, the rest is what I just consider fillers to make it an album. If you find this stuff remotely interesting, and love Halloween, then I strongly reccomend Murderdolls, Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13, and Songs for the Death, Dying, and the Dead. You'll either love or hate this guy!"
3,A disturbing story,"""Whitewash"" is a children's book that combines a story by Ntozake Shange with illustrations by Michael Sporn. The book jacket states that the story is ""[b]ased on a series of true incidents.""Helene-Angel is a young, urban African-American girl. She and her brother Mauricio are attacked by a gang of racist white kids who paint the girls' face a ghostly shade of white. The story deals with the aftermath of this repulsive crime.Shange has clearly approached this troubling material with admirable intentions, but I found the results unsatisfying. I felt that the ultimate message of racial reconciliation was not powerful enough to offset the nature of the crime. And a significant plot thread is left hanging. I fear that this book may be too upsetting for some kids; I recommend parental or teacher guidance."
1,Stopped working,"I had no problems with this feeder while it was working, but I have used it for less than a year and it just died."
1,Would only work for pets who are pretty casual about their food,"Knowing my cats, I set up a ""trial"" in the kitchen, letting them go at it with a little food in there for an hour unsupervised. They managed to completely disassemble the thing within the hour. Of course, they have outsmarted EVERY automatic feeder I have tried to date, but I was nonetheless disappointed."
1,Too little for too much,I had expected much more robust content for this operating system. The material was too lite for this subject matter. It was also too over priced !
3,a good overview book,"This a good overview book just for the beginner of mainframe system. What this book tells you is just what and not why and how, So if you want to find detail information, you have to look for other books."
1,Pienso que es una perdida de tiempo.,"Soy cristiana evangelica desde que era pequena, mi madre era presidente del circulo de ancianos de oracion en mi iglesia, Tengo mi fe bien puesta , gracias a Dios, pero me gusta algunos libros de rebeca brown. pero hay que ser completamente ignorante, para creer lo que ella escribe en su libro de "" El vino a dar libertad a los cautivos"" soy lectora completamente, leo muchos libros cristianos y bien consagrada, pero no le creo nada a esta escritora de lo que escribio en este libro, parece fantasia, y si creo que es fantasia, porque satanas jamas se te presenta en llamas , satanas es astuto, si el te quiere, vendra a ti disfrazado de una forma que no le temas, para poder agarrarte. pero no asi con capuchas y vainas. sencillamente no creo, y fue una perdida de tiempo. lo que lei"
3,"Cute, but little room","I like the bowl because it is cute and has three storage compartments. However, each compartment is very tiny ... including the largest of the three. I don't regret buying it, but the compartments are very small compared to the bowl itself which takes up a lot of space."
3,okay,"This is a good stimulator, but it's a little on the ""thick"" side--and I'm a 40 yr.old with 2 teens. Overall it's a good product, and very quiet, but you definitely have to be careful at first, as it's a bit hard to get in all the way."
2,Not impressed,"First off, this thing is MUCH bigger than what it appears. It's about 7"" long and about 5"" around at its thickest point. It's a bit heavy and the vibration is subpar. The only time I've had any ""fun"" with this toy is with a partner. So if you're looking for a solo toy, you might want to check out other g-spot vibes."
4,Good product for the price,This is good. Although there is a nice level of vibrations and does the job (especially if you insert the toy with the tip facing down-towards your bottom) I don't think there is a big difference in the vibration level (increasing or decreasing using the dial on the top). Only critique I have is this overpowering latex/silicone/plastic smell. I store this toy in a breathable cotton bag in a cabinet and everytime I open the cabinet you can definitely smell the toy.
2,Review,In looking at the picture I thought this was much smaller. Once I opened the package and installed the batteries the rubber/ plastic smell was overwhelming!I do like the fact that this is multi speed.
1,This sucks,"This vibe is terrible. Bought it a few days ago, and put fresh batteries in it, and it died after five minutes. Way too big, and wasn't waterproff. Very disappointed. AND there is NO refund of ANY type for this product because of the nature it is used for. I think I'll just stick to my boyfriend for pleasure. That way I won't get ripped off and I'll be very happy >:o)"
4,"Good size, shape and firmness",There was only one thing that keeps this from getting a 5 star rating and its that the vibrations are not strong at all at the highest setting. We use this for the foreplay and the curved tip does get to ger g spot which gets her aroused considerably and opens her appetite a lot. It is firm yet flexible and the textured surface adds new sensations to spice up the sex life. The surface is very sleek and quite smooth which makes it very easy to use and enjoy. Waterproof is a big plus!
2,Mislead by Name of Product,I chose this rating because I was mislead by the name of the product. I understood there to be 9 mult-speeds. There are not nine speeds therefore the product was not what I thought I was buying. I am unhappy with the product.
3,pretty good,It's ok . not great but not bad . good vibrations but just something about the shape that's not for me .
1,Seeing Anthropology,Did not have DVD so it was a bad deal. Couldn't watch the film clips for the course so I didn't do well on the tests! Wont buy a textbook on Amazon again!
3,"Good, but not quite ""electric""","I did like the mystery, though I expected to see and hear more from the main character, Inspector Adam Dalgleish. The story flowed (and sometimes bounced) between points of view of most of the people/suspects in the story, as well as Inspector Dagleish. The mystery was intriguing, though the focus seemed to be primarily on the psychology of the house full of suspects instead of on the actual mystery.Still, I did enjoy the book, and it was a quick read. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series, and hoping that the main character (Dalgleish) shows up a bit more as we go along."
3,Cover Her Face,"This book, written in 1961 is in the British Mystery style with some stilted language and measured events. The final outcome is unexpected and the author has set up a series for her lead detective with her first in the series. The character development is quite thorough. I enjoyed the book but it was slow by 2011 standards."
1,Rubbish..,"This has to be her worst novel. The characterization of the victim is so poorly developed and unbelievable that it is almost ludicrous. It seems the victim played with people's feelings and that eventually leads to her death. In fact, it seemed to me that James read lot of Christie and wrote this mish-mash as a tribute, perhaps?"
2,Don't start here,"This book is perhaps not the best place to start in the Adam Dalgliesh series (although it is the first book the author wrote in the series). This is my least favourite P D James book, and I suggest you read it last!Much better to start with A Mind to Murder, Unnatural Causes or the brilliant Shroud for a Nightingale."
4,Tension at Table,"The distinguished Adam Dalgliesh stories begin with Cover Her Face. Few will find this their favorite book in the series. I decided to read Cover Her Face again to provide perspective on P.D. James's latest, The Lighthouse. From that retrospective look, I came away even more impressed with The Lighthouse.But I do recommend that you read Cover Her Face. Although it isn't going to be a favorite of yours, it will be good reading.The book's main weakness is that the detailed development of the place and characters doesn't quite have rich enough material to work with.The plot itself has some marvelous twists and turns that build around the character of a most unusual murder victim, Sally Jupp, a marginally acceptable servant in a wealthy home. The other interesting aspect of the story relates to several interesting variations on the locked room mystery subgenre.In later stories in the series, Baroness James let her imagination run freer . . . with superb results."
4,Cover: Cover her Face,"PD James delivers expert craftsmanship. The plot was seamless and flawless. The only slight annoyance to me was the conventional end-game parlor convocation of suspects, which did, however, have the benefit of providing a review of a complicated plot. The dialogue was witty and natural, unlike the work of many more recent, less gifted authors. James is in same class as Sayers, Marsh, Murdoch."
4,Cover Her Face,"P.D. James is a little wordy, but her Adam Dalgliesh series is excellent. If you like British mysteries this is a good one."
5,Smooth as a razor blade,"I don't usually go in for dance music, but this tune really rocked me. A little retro 80's, a little Manson's ""Beautiful People."""
3,Cute but Dated,"This is a ""how women see sex"" type cartoon book from the early eighties. I THINK it was serialised in National Lampoon at the time.It's cute, it's light, it's frothy and the drawings have a certain new wave charm. But the world has moved on since then. If I cast my mind back to that time I find it funny, otherwise it's a bit dull."
2,You get what you pay for,I should have known by the price that if you don't pay for X-acto you don't get X-acto. I'm keeping it but with a lesson learned. Flimsy blades and a cheep case.
3,An interesting first novel,"Nick Mamatas will probably gain popularity in increments and remain a cult writer for many years before achieving widespread recognition.This is a more an interesting first novel than a great work of literature. It has its moments, but for the most part it's an interesting failure. The 1860s Draft Riot scenes deliver a nice tension. Will Patten is a scary character simply because you initially identify with him. Unfortunately Patten gets lost in the ghost story and the main character - Ahmadi Jenkins - gay dancer and victim of circumstances - takes over. Ahmadi is a dull character. He has no personality. Most of the book involves nasty things happening to Ahmadi and the lack of characterization undercuts any tension.Buy this book if you're a diehard fan. If you're merely curious, buy another Mamatas book."
5,Outstanding Work By Newcomer,Mamatas is a stunning new talent; his prose is evocative and his turns of phrase alternate between horrifying and fall-down funny. When I finished Northern Gothic I wanted /more/. There's a verisimilitude to the scenes that make it clear that Mamatas has done his research and has a keen sense for the inside of his characters' heads.
2,There are better options that cost less,"I'm sorry to say that this product failed to meet my expectations.ProsTight connection to laptopCons-Too easy to accidentally change the combination which makes it difficult to set the combo and remove the lock.-This product is built to fit on the right side of a laptop. If you're laptop is like mine where the plug is on the left side, you have to turn the laptop around in order to unlock it (unless you don't mind doing it backwards)"
3,"Bad for ""time sensitive"" deliveries","There is no option to select delivery date, and I was not contacted by the distributor. In the end, my mom got her Mother's Day flowers about half a week early - good thing I didn't order in January!"
4,Almost perfect!,"Only missing piece is the possibility to leave a personal note, have I missed something?"
4,Modern Malian pop,"Ornate, expansively arranged West African music, very much in keeping with the world-pop crossovers of Youssou N'Dour, Habib Koite, Toumane Diabate and others. Bambino is one of the younger Guinean griots, son of singer Marlama Samoura, a popular vocalist during the late 1960s. Bambino's approach is pretty adventurous and varied; on with a hip-hop flavored tune, ""Promesse,"" a duet with Parisian-based Senegalese rapper Diziz La Peste. Kinda slick, but kinda nice!"
4,Good Tudor fiction,"There are fewer loftier characters of the Tudor era, than Katherine of Aragon, and I felt this author of years ago presented the tale very well. Lofts weaves a fine tapestry of the much known about era, keeping the facts closely threaded with the tale itself. I felt a lot more respect for Katherine herself, since I've always been more an admirer of Anne Boleyn.I have the book about Henry's second wife ""The Concubine"" and it will interesting to hear of the great matter from a different perspective. The next book is a little bit longer, which might be saying something in that alone."
4,A Royal Treat....,"....a fascinating and very pleasurable read. Even when we know this history and ""how the story turns out,"" it's wonderful to get a bird's eye view into the life of Henry VIII's first wife, by all indications an intelligent, kind, and pious person....truly fit to be a queen. A sad story altogether and yet hopeful -- this lady was inspirational. Don't miss this great read! This was my first Norah Lofts novel, and I will look for more."
2,Its Ok,"I have had the product for more than a year, The distance that you can start your car remotely is very limited and its no where close to what is claimed in the manual, my brother exchanged it with Cobra system which works close to one mile away if i were you i would spend the extra money and get the cobra.Hope this helps."
3,Where the hell is my magazine!! (edit),"Purchased on 07/12/2011, have not gotten a single issue.Other magazines ordered at the same time have already arrived.Guess I'm cancelling this subscription......EditGot the first Magazine.Will report full review after next month arrives."
3,It's OK,"I got this because a friend of mine had the Microsoft Plus! with a fish screen saver on it that I thought was really cool. This is pretty neat, too, but I think the Plus! version looks more realistic. This one has more features and is more customizable, but when you get right down to it, the Microsoft one looks more real and that is the whole point of a screen saver like this, in my opinion. I don't mean to bash the product too much (I did give it 3 stars)--the fish themselves look great. It's just that their movements are not as believable and sometimes they swim through rocks and things (the z-buffering is not right). The optional sound effects are advertised as ""soothing"", but I found them annoying. All in all, a good product, but I disagree with the claim, ""So life-like, you will swear the fish are real!"""
1,Fuming in Florida,"I hate this software! I'm upset that I wasted my money! I can't believe this product is on the market. It is so lousy... the scenery in the tanks is really, really ugly and very fake looking... what's up w/the moss covered bowling balls ? The fish keep freezing for 4 seconds or so. When I try to access the settings, feeding, etc, it stalls and twice i've had to reboot.. i don't have anything else that causes this. Don't waste your money like i did .. fif"
1,Total Ripoff!,"I purchased 2 aquarium programs prior to the Aquazone purchase, so I know what ""realistic"" looks like, and I assure you, this program is anything but! The plants are stationary, and don't sway with the motion of the water; the bubbles look like drawn circles, as opposed to my other programs, where the bubbles look like a real aerator; the fish in this program swim, then freeze for a second, with no motion at all - then swim haltingly again; the backgrounds are anything but convincing, and I recommend looking at other programs before wasting your money on this one."
1,Not good,"The quality of the animation reminds me of Terry Gilliam's Monty Python cartoons. The edges of things are very distinct, which gives the background a flat, 2-D appearance. Unfortunately, the fish are not nearly as amusing as Monty Phyton."
3,Good musical value,"Three of Haydn's most pleasant, if not most note-worthy, symphonies are ably performed on this CD. This disk is an excellent choice for the casual listener who enjoys Haydn's style, but a really serious Haydn fan would probably search further. Typical Naxos competance in the recording quality."
2,Why a book on her?,"Now I'm not saying that this isn't a good book, by no means. All I'm asking is why did they make a book out of a character that plays such a minor role in the original Chronicles that she is in it for only one chapter. Now we all know what happened in the Chronicles to her and her beloved Perechon. But for those who haven't read the Chronicles I won't spoil it. This book has no meaning if you have already read the Chronicles and know what is to happen. Never did I feel interest in this character and the only reason why I bought this book was because it had the DragonLance name on the cover. I have not been so careless since...."
4,this game is,This game was really fun I enjoyed it a lot. It came on time wich was very nice. so I could play it.
3,Ski sun glasses,"Nice glasses, they are a little tight for me but they worked better than goggles for skiing."
3,Pretty decent,"I like the look, they're pretty comfy. My only complaint is that they do fog up. I like that they come with a nice little bag for them and they can be worn as sunglasses without looking too weird. I fall alot when a snowboard, I actually tumbled down the side of a mountain and they didn't break or fall of or anything so I'm pretty satisfied. I wear them under my hat, so sometimes I do get a little bit of pain/annoyance at the tips behind my ears, but it's nothing some adjusting can't fix. Unfortunately, my dog chewed them up so I will be buying more."
1,Cheap product......,"After 3 times it broke in pieces, end up buying something more reliable that lasted the whole ski season and many more to come......pay extra for a better item, cheap materials. Disposable glasses!"
4,Intense smell,Pretty ingenious toy idea. They smell like the real smell and it is intense. My daughter loved these pocket size dolls and played with them quite a bit.
4,So cute,These dolls are SO cute and my nieces LOVE them! The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are smaller than I expected. I was looking for a barbie size doll and they are much smaller than that. Definitely worth the price I paid though (half off original price).
5,Every girls dream,"Well i am a big girl here - 31 - so I can't comment on the toys education or durability as it doesn't need to be those things to me. I just think the Soda Pop girls are gorgeous and wish they were around when I was young. I love their clothing and scents, they are just gorgeous."
3,What i really wanna see...,"I bought this DVD, it generally was good, however it's sopposed to be about the history of WOLVERINE, not his ""currrent"" adventures... the WWII episode would have been better & some of the other Weapon X and Sabretooth oriented episodes would have been welcomed, personally I WOULD KILL(literally) for a boxed set of all 76(or so) episodes, in their entirety on DVD... that would make the greatest Chirstmas gift ever, now that's an X-FANS dream come true!!"
3,"Not bad, could've been better","The video quality is about an 8 at best. Chris Claremont's commentary often has nothing to do with what you're seeing on screen. ""The Lotus and the Steel"" is somewhat boring, and ""Out of the Past"" isn't all that interesting either. So what's good about this DVD? First of all, ""Nightcrawler"" and second, the bonus feature ""The Final Decision."" If you were a big fan of the 90s TV series (like me), then by all means get this DVD. Just shop around first ;-)"
4,Great,"After seeing X2, my interest in X-Men once again came alive. This DVD is great. They picked some very good episodes from the cartoon series and it felt very nostalgic. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because another episode or 2 would have been appreciated."
4,Is that guy kidding?,"""The Chris Claremont interview shows what a dull/uninventive writer he really is. I'm glad he's not involved with the X-Men movies in any way. Only Stan Lee is."" -A Viewer (See below)Is he kidding? Not only is Chris Claremont CURRENTLY writing Uncanny X-men, he's also the best writer they ever had, penning for example a funny little tale called THE PHOENIX SAGA! Which X-Men 3 is going to be based on!! Stan Lee's great, but Chris Claremont did for X-Men what Miller did for Daredevil... he brought them to the next level.I agree with the other reviews that this show was great, but why are they giving them to us bit by bit? X-Men is the most popular comic of all time, and this show is arguably as good as Batman's show, if in different ways. They are releasing Batman properly, so why not X-Men?"
3,Enjoyable.,"The Shanhai Woolies are entertaining and skilled. Although this album will never make it to my ""favorites"" folder, it is entirely enjoyable."
4,Sizzling!,"All right, I admit I'm new to the world of ""Secrets."" Volume 5 is the first I've read and the first two authors (Shannon Hollis and B.J.McCall) wrote top quality stories with racy plots, in-depth characters and red-hot sex ... a bit more than I expected. If you want to read sizzling scenes spiced with romance and excellent writing, keep your eye on these two!"
2,...,"Alisa Smith and Jones - This one had a good plot, but not a good female lead. Meredith was mean and too uptight.Strictly Business - This story had a good plot, good characters, great writing, and sexy erotica.Insatiable - This was a cute story that ended on a cliffhanger really, but not very hot.Beneath Two Moons - This was the worst. Dr. Kelsey was a rude, cold female lead who only really liked Conor for sex. She didn't want to be with him because she thought he'd only think of her as a sex fling and still have other women. But she doesn't particularly care for anything but sex with this gorgeous old-fashioned cowboy. She stupidly walked away from him after one of their sexual encounters like it was no big deal, leaving him hurt. The ending was rushed and totally unbelievable."
2,Not nearly as good as the previous editions,"Having read some of the other volumes of Secrets and been pleased, I settled in expecting something dramatic and steamy and a lot of fun. Instead I found stilted writing, characters who weren't very interesting and a lack of sexual tension. It read more like pornography--strangers having sex without reason--than anything that could be labeled romantic erotica."
2,A reader from Washington,"After reading the previous 4 editions of Secrets, which were all very good stories, I was not nearly as pleased with this edition. The stories and characters were not very interesting."
2,SO disappointed,"As the mother of 2 young girls, I am a HUGE fan of the Angelina Ballerina videos (I own 5)...they are polite, refined and teach exemplary behavior lessons. However, I was SO upset to see that one of the characters on this video cursed...one of the characters actually said ""damn""....I rewound it 4 times to be sure I heard correctly. Perhaps not a big deal to you...and yes, these are manufactured in England where the word has less import...but there is SO little in the world that is still wholesome enough for young girls to enjoy...did they really have to ruin it for me? So, while I am a huge believer in Angelina generally, I take a pass on this one."
1,Low Quality,"All the videos are here, but the quality is not very good. All the videos are in 4:3 except for ""Greedy Fly"" which is in an infuriating 16x9 format trapped inside of a 4:3 box! Obviously the master was widescreen, but it was just thrown in here in bad form. Great videos, just bad production values."
3,Memorabilia,"Since my college days, I've always be a fan of Bush (not the president) and I want to watch thier DVD so I buy this as a treat for myself...if you're really a fan this is for you, but if not well my observation is, it's not giving me any adrenalin when I watch this...thier video are ok, but maybe i am just addicted to heavy death nowadays...."
3,"Good info, but highly over-produced","Paul Sellers is great--a real master and good teacher. Problem is the videos are way over-produced, making it rather frustrating to watch. I wish there were less special effects and more Paul Sellers teaching. It's not quite as bad as you go through the later videos, but the first couple are tough. I'd buy it again, though, as the content is really helpful for an amateur like me."
4,Great Product - Annoying Intros,"Full stop, this is a great series that has seriously helped me to improve my woodworking skills. 5 Stars across the board with one exception, which dropped it to 5 stars. When you click on a chapter or sub-chapter lesson there is a jolting, annoying and time-consuming digital graphic display with music that will make you think you're watching the Bourne Identity. Even with this minor irritation, which get's comical after awhile, well worth the money."
2,Not a tour de force,"Although a solid performance for a low price, I would have to discourage listeners from taking Holten's approach as definitive. It is very difficult to approach these works (esp. the Missa Prolationum) with a larger ensemble knowing that the beauty of the work lies in its subtleties. This is very difficult to achieve with a larger group of singers, no matter how professionally they are trained. This is best accomplished by a smaller ensemble. In this case I would direct the listener to a recording of the Missa Prolationum by the Hilliard Ensemble on EMI (EMI 7497982). This is the best performance I have heard of this work. Virtually everything else is a let down. If you don't believe me, find the Hilliard Ensemble work and compare for yourself."
2,"No continuity, no racing, just clips. No fun.","This is really a lame video. It has a couple of good wrecks, and a few hot babes, but overall is is a disappointment. If you are a real POPBRA or other related afficinado of offshore racing affiliations, I assure you, you will find this as boring as I did. Take my advice, don't buy it, GO to a race!"
4,Holds Up,"I have bought 3 of these for our MP3 players. 2 went to my 9 year old twins and 1 to my husband. There MP3 players have gone on vacations, car rides, to the beach ect and the cover has held up well. We use the MP3 players very regularly and even with the changing of batteries the covers seem to be doing well. We have had them for 7 months and no problems."
4,What Did I Just Read?,"This story was good but strange at the same time. There is not that much to the story itself. It didn't add that much to the Recluce series. Yes it explained some things, but this book is mostly about work and building things. I don't know why, but I just kept reading and reading and reading...."
2,Wish it was better.....a lot better......,"I'm not done this book yet, and so far am page 232. I am forcing my self to read it in the vain hope that i will be able to justify to myself the spending of 8 odd dollars. It seems too predictable, and the characters seem soo one dimensional it makes Curious George books look like university literature. I will continue to read it, if for no other reason than because i do like some books in the series......"
4,Another fine book,"Another fine book in the Saga of Recluce series. It is the story of the Angels and how they carved a niche on the Roof of the World. Personally, I got hooked into the book by the origin of the Angels. I was truely interested in their war against the deamons and in the structure of how their two societies were set up. Unfortunately, that is the first chaper or three. From there it became a survival story on the planet. Which all in all isn't bad, but the ending left me wanting more. To me there are issues between many of the characters that need to be resolved. Especially the Men vs. Women in society. It needed to be resolved for better or worse. I know the next book is out already. I hope it answers the question I have. With the quirky references to some of the other stories, it was a fun read. The unresolved tensions kept me going through the book. It is also a good place to start if you are new to the series"
4,NOT WHAT I REQUESTED,"did not received the flavour that I requested., which was blueberry, I've received it in grape flavour. And it expires in two weeks!, wh lifetime product is year!"
1,This book stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This Book stinks!!!!!! I'm sure you will think that too
2,Great lyrics. Not so great music.,"I waited a long time for Deborah to release another album and just was not pleased. Cooler Heart, her follow up to Stretcher, just doesn't compare to her previous release. (Stretcher gets a 5+. That one I recommend unhesitantly.) It seems to me that Deborah put forth a lot more effort into Stretcher. Cooler Heart does have some great lyrics, but the music is lacking."
4,Fun Inside,"We bought this as a small gift for our 4 year old. She loves it. She slept in it on her floor for the first few nights. The laterns lock for the battery was not designed well so be careful of that, Otherwise great indoor camping set."
4,Apple Strudel Pop Tarts not stocked in local stores,"Apple Strudel is my favorite Pop Tart flavor. I had been looking for these for over two months at local stores in the Washington, D.C. metro area, but was not able to find them. I randomly did a search on Google and discovered that Amazon.com had them in a large quantity. I still haven't run out of them yet, but will buy more when I do."
4,Dance Dance Revolution,"Our whole family loves it. We have an 8 & 10 yr old, the 4 of us all have so much fun together playing. Plus you have the added benefit of moving around and getting exercise. Definitely a great addition to our home!"
1,do not waste your money,I bought this for my two daughters (7 & 8at the time) for last Christmas. They were not excited about it. They tried it once and could not keep up. They felt very frustrated and never played it again. The music and graphics stink.
1,Poor Value,"I am disappointed in the DDR TV Pad for a number of reasons. The sound quality is poor, the video quality is poor, the sound selection is poor and the graphics are 1970's. I would not recommend the purchase of this product until you have the chance to see it first.Not worth the cost at all."
2,Not so great on carpet,We were a little disappointed with the DDR system. The pad moves around alot and gets all wrinkled up. The positive is that you get a really good work-out. We were also very upset that we didn't receive the one we ordered and the seller didn't care. Might be our last online purchase for while.
2,you get what you pay for,"$150+ for a more expensive system or $30 for this product. First of all, the song titles are not what is advertised, and the sound is poor. After using the more expensive DDR system, this does not come close."
3,You get what you pay for,This product works just fine. The dance steps go pretty quick and my kids were quickly frustrated with that but the pinball game is a big hit and they may get back to the dancing later. I just wanted something physical that the kids could use indoors this winter and I got it.
2,Had to return 1st one,"Started out as fun (although pretty primitive and basic). Can't really say much more about this product yet, though, because after a couple of plays it stopped working correctly and we returned it for a replacement. Still awaiting the replacement; hoping to receive it soon because the kids are all out of patience! One other comment, re. set-up - we have an older TV and the only way I could get it to work was to plug it into the front jacks of my DVD player (which was hooked up to my TV) and then toggle through the various input options until it showed up on the screen - not exactly the simple plug and play I'd hoped for. Also, this product seems to work best on a hard floor, not as well on carpet; bummer for us because our TV room has carpet."
4,dance dance revolution tv pad,"great exercise for the kids, instead of being braindead in front of the computer!!! pad moves around a little on the carpet, a little difficult for the under 8 population; would recommend for people without a system like play station,etc."
2,2 Players Blue Twin DDR Dance Dance Revolution TV Pad (No System Needed),"It's good if you don't mind the cheap graphics. It does do it's job, but not too many selection as far as music goes. It does what it says, no system need!!!! That's a +."
2,Too hard to play,Not that fun doesnt stay in one place on the floor. its hard to tell if you have hit the mark. My 8 year old has played it for 5 minutes and decided its not very fun.
4,Fairly Detailed (and good) Rah-Rah,"I enjoyed this book for several reasons. It inspired me to hear the stories of real dream teams and their leaders. These are real dream teams - no question. And it gave a very good introduction/overview of seven practices needed to move teams to become high performing teams. I also enjoyed it because it gave real life examples for each of its practices. It covers the basics and even introduces some new basics, which really makes it valuable. The book is a lot of hype and sales pitches for teamwork, and didn't cover much detail, or the nitty gritty hard work of making teams effective, but as an introduction, I haven't seen better. I'm using it as a textbook for a class and my students LOVE it. Well worth the read."
4,Brian Stokes Mitchell is breathtaking,"I bought this CD immediately after seeing the show. Brian Stokes Mitchell is incredible in both voice and interpretation. It is as if these songs we have all heard over and over again are fresh and new. Sabello's Sancho is a bit schticky for my liking, but if you like that sort of thing, you'll enjoy it. How anyone could not be enraptured by Mr. Mitchell's performance is hard to believe, but then...to each his Dulcinea."
2,Lackluster recording,"The only reason to own this new cast recording is to hear Brian Stokes Mitchell. His glorious voice services the score well. However, he alone can't carry this whole show. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is painful to hear. The heart wrenching dialogue when Don Quixote is dying towards the end is painfully embarrassing to hear. Joan Diener she ain't. Ernie Sabella sounds like every other actor who has ever played Sancho.A big disappointment. The production values are excellent but I recommend you buy something else."
3,Worth listening to just for the Impossible Dream,"While La Mancha is not one of my favorite musicals, this production had some great moments. Great cast and set. The standout is Brian Stokes Mitchell's performance of the Impossible Dream. The performance of this song stands out among the top three live musical theatre performances I have seen and is definitely captured in this recording. For some this may be worth having in your collection just for the one song."
3,La Mancha,"This is an utterly forgettable version of Man of La Mancha, the standouts however are Brian Stokes Mitchell and Ernie Sabella, these two move the show by pure force of will. The other actors don't comply to make just another show on just another resume. The Impossible Dream however is the greatest that it has ever sounded with Mitchells booming baritone."
3,could be better,"yes, i do love pierce pettis, but this is not my favorite album of his. i enjoy several songs (my life of crime, you move me, absalom), but the album as a whole is not one of my favorites. i think Everything Matters is much stronger."
1,Ordinary music - listen to the samples before buy,"These musics are nothing close what I listened in John Fahey's radio in Pandora. I feel I was cheated by Pandora, i already filed a complaint to them as well"
5,WOW!,It's hard to believe a 17 year old wrote this book. I would recommend this book to anyone with a teenager. It is written the way teens talk. The way Michael has written the characters' personalities makes me think I know them personally. I can't wait for the sequels to come out!
5,excellent.,"I didn't expect this book to be as good as it was. Michael D. Sigler manages to tie in a riviting science fiction tale with a bit of social drama from a teenage perspective. During some parts I couldn't help but laugh outloud, and during others I could sincerely empathize with the characters. It is suprising that Sigler is only 17, the writing is definitely beyond his age level of writing.without spoiling the plot, I encourage you to buy this book."
5,Great Story!!!,"I loved this story. I will not say that I was a bit disappointed at the end because I want a HEA for my favorite characters but none the less, a wounderfully written book."
5,my new favorite book,this book was outstandinf. i fell in love with the characters and could not put it down. its a must read for any romance novel lover. sparks is geat at making you feel the emotion. cant wait for themovie!
4,So Sweet,"I really liked the story line. I actually didn't like that Savannah is so perfect. It's tough to feel sorry for a girl that is perfect and whom everybody would fall for. Her best friend is too perfect also. I would rather have a writer add at least one flaw to each main character. John Tyree, on the other hand, is the character with the most flaws and the one I love the most."
5,Very great quality,"I loved this book, it made me cry so hard! It is written very well, but not too heavy. Nicholas Sparks is such a great author and I would love to see a Dear John sequal."
4,A Quick Read,"I enjoyed this book because it is told from the perspective of John, which was different from many of Nicholas Sparks books. It was loving, sad, heartbreaking,and wonderful. It showed how love sometimes doesn't always work the way we expect it to but in life in all situations it is still present. I couldn't put it down."
4,It's The Notebook meets The Bridges of Madison County!,"This was a realistic tale of two-star crossed lovers. I enjoyed reading it immensely! The only way to describe it is that it's The Notebook meets The Bridges of Madison County. Everyone wants to read the novel with the happily ever after, but this one wouldn't have worked any other way! Although the ending is sad, it still is good and bittersweet. I can't say anymore or I will spoil the good read!"
3,Good But Not a Favorite.,"I don't know why but this just wasn't one of my favorite Spark's stories.Maybe it was the ending that threw me off or maybe I just never felt that connection that I normally do to his characters, either way I just didn't love this book and that is hard for me to admit because I am a HUGE Sparks fan."
2,Couldn't finish it...,"I'm sorry, but I couldn't completely get through this one. I didn't enjoy the plot and the characters were not engaging to me. I have liked some of this author's other work, but this one was not a winner."
2,"Slow, fails to bring depth to the characters.","Not one of Spark's best. The book moves at a slow pace, the characters are predictable and worse, flat; Sparks never manages to make the reader care about what happens to them. Die-hard hopeful, I read to the end, hoping for a twist or for some type of redemption in the slow and non-engaging story. It never arrived."
5,My heart ached,"I just finished the book, and the ending isn't what I had in mind but the way Sparks ended it makes it that much more unforgettable and leaves us with a strong emotion. You must read it and feel for yourself the aching in your heart. I especially love the relationship between John and his father. A father son relationship isn't something I would find amusing, but this one is special. It is beautifully written, and I love how Sparks uses letters as a way of communication. I was able to understand from deep down inside the feelings portrayed in the letters. It's funny how you get so much more from a written letter than from a conversation in person. I highly recommend!"
3,"Very disappointed, all this reading for a crappy ending. This is a very tragic love story.","Without spoiling the book for anyone all I will say is some love stories are just tragic, if you don't like tragic love stories don't read this book. Very disappointed in the ending"
3,"Too much detail, but a good story","I feel that this book had a lot of detail that was quite boring. It left me wishing for the end to come faster. I also felt that the description of the characters didn't fit the time period. It felt to me like the characters belonged in the 1940's. While it may sound like I didn't like this book, I did enjoy the story. It is very predictable, but still enjoyable. The last 100 pages were more interesting and kept my attention. All in all, I would suggest this book to those that enjoy romantic stories by Sparks. I think you have to be his fan in order to like this one."
3,Average read,It was a good book...not great...but good. It was a good summer day type of book. Nothing terrific or outstanding just average good.
3,A disappointment but worth a read.,"This book was very predictable. But worth a read. I really wanted to read the book before I watched the movie but I not only was disappointed with the movie, I was also disappointed with this book. I wanted a change and it seems like more of Nicholas Sparks' books are becoming more and more predicable.I highly recommend his new book called The Last Song. Not only was the book the best book ever, but the movie was amazing! Miley is a very talented actress!"
5,don't read the amazon reviews,"There are too many spoilers in the comments by other reviewers, you will enjoy this masterpiece a lot more, if like me, you don't know how it concludes. I picked up the audio book at the library read by Holter Graham (to perfection) and fell into a very realistic tale of Savannah the pretty college student and John a soldier on two-week leave from the Army. The easy ""down-home"" storytelling and dialogue was so real it almost feels like it's not made up. Nicholas Sparks is a fantastic writer who I've enjoyed before but Dear John was easily on a higher level of entertainment value for this reader."
3,Not a military book,"I'm a military officer who recently returned from Iraq and thought this book would be a change of pace while giving me some Iraq action to boot. Even though I would not tell my soldiers I enjoyed the love story, it did nothing for my thirst of Iraq stories. If you are looking for an easy to read and nice story with a wonderful ending you have come to the right book. Even though love hurts the right thing finds its home."
2,Not his best,"The thing that made me not want to read the book right off the bat was the fact that he gives away the ending in the prologue. The plot was ok, but it was just too predictable. Nicholas Sparks becomes very monotonous in his writing at times, which makes reading some of his books tedious. Honestly, this book made me mad with the way it ended. Not one of his best."
3,Disappointing,"John, a young army recruit, grew up with his autistic dad in North Carolina. While on leave from the army, he falls for Savannah, a young college student doing a charity project for the summer. After 2 weeks of bliss, they face a year of separation as John is based in Germany - can their relationship survive? I don't want to reveal anymore, but I thought that this story was unrealistic and there were a lot of cliches. The parts on autism are interesting but Sparks only scratches the surface and at the end of the day autism doesn't really add much to the story. Not Sparks' best."
1,Boring,"Don't know how this book continues to be on the Bestseller list. I am up to page 180 and find it the most boring book I've read in a long time. There's just nothing interesting about this book and I'm having a hard time finishing it. Based on other reviews here, it doesn't sound like I'm in for a fantastic finish."
4,Great read,Great love story. Typical Nicholas sparks book. Tugged at your heart and filled you with hope. I didn't care for the ending. I need a fairy tale ending.
5,Good book,The book was good and definitely for 13+ though. If you want to read this book know that it has a lot of romance
5,Best book ever!,I would highly suggest reading this book! It will really show you what true love is and it makes you feel like it's real!
2,"Even for a romance, this was a little thin, at best <m>","I have to say that this book was a bit of a let down. Part I was the best part of the whole book, full of vivid depiction of character, both in the town and in dialogue. Things fell apart in Parts 2 and 3, mainly because Sparks falls back on cliches, generalities and vagueries that are frustrating to read. It almost feels like in the fear of getting things wrong, it's better not to get them at all, or capture things as blandly as possible.And it IS bland, which is unfortunate. But, on the upside, at least he's original. Or as original as you can be in a genre that's been mashed to a pulp.Not that I am a fan of abandoning a read, but if your time is important to you, close the book at the end of Part 1."
3,More like the old Sparks books but....,"I love Nicholas Sparks and I was not as thrilled with his two previous novels, ""True Believer"" and ""At First Sight"". This book was more like the Sparks I know but still seemed to be lacking something for me that I can't quite put my finger on. It held my interest though and I still enjoyed it but his earlier books are definitely better. This one doesn't seem to have the substance to be made into a movie as some of his other books have. I could be proved wrong however."
2,Sparks worst book yet,"I have been a Nicholas Sparks fan and I was very disappointed with this book. Too predictable, very depressing..."
2,A total disappointment and very depressing,"I've always been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and I couldn't wait to read Dear John. Well, there was no reason to rush. It starts out okay, but then just gets more and more depressing. The main girl character is annoying and you hope that John will find someone who deserves him, instead of just pouting over her for most the book.I cannot wait for another Nicholas Sparks book, but only because I want to know that he hasn't lost his touch, and that this novel was just a fluck."
3,Dear John,Robin in Tennessee (Disappointing)I loved this book in the beginning and couldn't put it down. The romance was amazing but then it fell apart into depressing sadness. I like to finish a book and be happy I read it.
2,"Great beginning, but horrible ending.","Thought this book would be a good romance, which it was @ first. but then took a horrible turn. I HATED the ending!!!"
5,Great Book/Quick Read,"Loved ""Dear John"" and I couldn't put it down! Can't wait to watch the movie now! Wonderful story of true love and the lengths people go for those they love."
2,Much better romances out there,"I was so disappointed with this book. It felt rushed and shallow from John's perspective. I didn't get the depth of feeling that normally accompany a plot like this. Instead it felt like a chronology of events from when they meet until the end. And although I enjoyed the premise and found the ending sad I felt it an appropriate ending. It was about the only thing I truly felt was done right. I doubt I will go see the movie now, since I only read the book because the movie looked good."
1,OK if you like cliche,I have read many Nicholas Sparks books and for the most part have enjoyed them. I loved the notebook and I am always hoping that he will write another book along those lines. This book is over the top and very dissapointing! I found myself skimming and skipping pages of the book and a general feeling of annoyance as I read. One of the main problems with this book is that it is so cliche it is ridiculous! Almost every page is filled with either a cliche sappy romance scene or overkill on tragedies and the worst part is the way it ends. I felt like it was a waste of my time.
5,Great Book,"I read this book in about 2 days, I could not put it down. Although it is a typical love story I found the characters intriguing and likeable. I am embarrassed to admit it but I cried in the middle and I cried in the end. I don't know if I will feel the same way when I watch the movie. I think the ending of this book is sad but it shows that life doesn't always end with happy endings and that love alone sometimes isn't enough, other circumstances and LIFE gets in the way. I really feel for John's character in this book, in the way he feels for his father and Savannah. Great book but totally cheesy/romantic and I loved it, much like I loved ""The Notebook""."
3,Not My Cup of Tea,"I have to be objective with this review. Romance novels are NOT my thing, actually, I cannot stand them but for some odd reason, I read this book. Having said that, for what it was (Romance Novel) it was okay.I love me a good thriller or mystery so this really could not hold a candle (entertainment wise) but it was okay.The characters were just okay as was the plot. The ending was bittersweet and I appreciated it.I'll put it this way, this book did not change my opinions of romance novels. I'll steer clear of them in the future."
4,Good book,"I enjoyed reading Dear John. It's not just about John and Savannah's romance but also about John's relationship with his father and how over time it evolves into something much better than they had before. Sparks does a good job of showing that although mistakes can be made in a person's youth, it doesn't mean they're a lost cause. On a negative note, I wasn't real happy with the ending. John's a nice guy but the ends a little unbelievable no matter how nice he is."
2,Sorely disappointed. Not a fun or flowing read,I was disappointed in that it was a very hard read. The flow was not easy nor natural. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan. But not in this instance.
2,"Always a fan, but not my favorite","I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and have read every one of his books many times over. I was really anticipating this book, but felt disappointed while reading it. The writing style is very casual, awkward and lacking ""spark"" between John and Savannah. It often seemed more like a stiff, researched play by play of the day in the life of a soldier rather than a classic Sparks love story. The most redeeming quality of this book is the love story that developed between John and his father, which moved me to tears. Although this turned out to be my least favorite Sparks book, I will not hesitate to pick up the next one on release day!"
2,It dragged...,"Didn't care for it much, haven't watched the movie either even though I love Channing. Sorry but It dragged way to long for me."
3,Slow and boring,"I love romances but I found ""Dear John"" to drag on way to long, he was too ""noble"" and she was way too ""nice"". It didn't seem realistic and definitely did not hold my interest. I should have read the beginning and ending and saved myself the trouble of the entire middle of the book."
3,Great Read,"This was my first Nicholas Sparks book and I rather enjoyed it. It was a quick read and I couldn't put it down. He tells the story how it is and I appreciate that in an author. He doesn't get into these lengthy descriptions about unimportant things that make you want to skim or put the book down to return to the scene later. I enjoyed the characters. I also enjoyed the tugs on my heartstrings. I can tell you this will not be my last Nicholas Sparks novel.The reason I gave this a 3 out of 5 was because the story, though interesting, was very predictable. Other than that, this book was excellent!Can't wait to see how the movie turns out."
3,"Predictable, but heart-wrenching at times","I loved reading about the relationship between John and his father. It felt so real. The relationship between Savannah and John, however, felt contrived. I could understand why John fell for Savannah, but not the other way around so much. Towards the end, it became too predictable -- all aspects of the story. On the other hand, it was a good read -- I couldn't put the book down until I finished it, which is a rare thing for me, as I'm a little ADD that way. I would recommend the book as it is an easy read and Mr. Sparks' ability to create believable characters and their relationships is incredible. However, don't say I didn't tell you so if you feel let down by the predictable, unbelievable ending."
5,LOVE IT!,"I absolutely loved this book. I was never much of a reader before. But after reading this book it has made me want to read more Nicholas Sparks books. It was smooth reading, I didnt want to put the book down. I also recommend ""A Bend in the Road""."
2,What was that?,"After all of that development of how much they loved each other, Parts II and III just ruined it. It skimmed through 9/11 and the war, and why he stayed in the military longer. That was put in the story just as a little interlude of why he didn't come home at the end of his service. There was no depth or feeling about what that meant for anyone. Then, all of the sudden she found someone new, and when he returns, low and behold, she's married to Tim who happens to be dying? Wait, what just happened here? I didn't find what any of them did as a sign of true love. John, Savannah, and Tim suddenly became victims of their own selfish thoughts in the name of loving the other too much for their own good. Selling his Dad's coins for that? Stealing John's girl? Dumping John because he hasn't come home yet... to be with your best friend instead? I give it 2 stars because the love seemed like it had great promise to mean so much more, and it fizzled at the end."
3,Simply okay,"The book did not meet my expectations. I find myself comparing all his books to how I felt in ""The Guardian"" and nothing compares. One sided account of a soldier that you don't connect with."
1,depressing and not beleivable,"i think that this is a classic case of purposely trying to give a book an unhappy ending regardless if it fits the characters or not. in my opinion, the ending would have never turned out this way if the characters were real. not believable...depressing....waste of two nights. thank goodness i read it on my kindle and didn't pay full price for the book."
2,Disappointing ending,"I enjoyed most of the book until the ending. It really ruined the book for me. I wish I had never read it. One could make the argument that the main characters' relationship would never have worked, but I disagree. I did not think the ending was realistic. Really, who would ever do what this character, John, did? No way. I am very disappointed."
4,True Love,"This book was a love story about true love and not so much about romance. That's what I liked most about it. I found myself pulling for the girl even though it was written in first person from the guy's perspective. It showed how important it is to not rush into making decisions on a whim because the choices we make impact our lives forever. I especially liked the love relationship between the father and son and the tender moments they shared together reminded me of my dad and me. I liked the book and it was a fast read. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the author gave away the ending right in the prologue so I knew how it would end from the beginning.-Karen Arlettaz Zemek, Author of ""My Funny Dad, Harry"""
2,First disappointment by Nicholas Sparks,"I have all of Nicholas Sparks novels, and I can honestly say that this one left much to be desired. I have also raved about Nicholas Sparks' works to everyone; however, I don't have much to rave about this time. The book was too predictable; although I have often figured out other story lines written by Sparks, but this book did not have half of the depth that the others have had. I am disappointed in the book and hope to see that Nicholas Sparks goes back to his heart wrenching story lines. Hopefully he can find time (outside of coaching track) to write another wonderful novel such as The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, The Wedding, and the list goes on (but stops at Dear John)!"
2,"disappointing, but entertaining","I admit, I used to think Nicholas Sparks was dull and unimaginative, and that ALL of his stories sounded the same but with different characters, but after reading almost all of his books, I have to admit that I like his simplicity, and he has slowly become a favorite of mine. I was excited to hear about ""Dear John"" coming out, since my husband is a Marine. The book was great at the beginning (aside from using the word 'portending' about a thousand times) up until Savannah sends him the fated ""Dear John"" letter. I understand, waiting a long time for a loved one while he is in the military and deployed is painstaking. But to break up with them for choosing to defend your country over being with a loved one? That's a little BS, if you ask me. Especially after John sells his father's collection for a lousy price and then gives it all away to help Savannah's husband. No one in their right mind would do that, but then again, this is Nicholas Sparks."
2,Dear John review,"This is my first, and maybe last Nicolas Sparks book. I read it simply because of the military situation. It was a bit boring, but found it to be a quick read. I had absolutely no interest in Savannah at all. What was so great about her? My deal was with John. As short as their relationship was, I wanted to tell him to ""Get over it already!"". His depression when they are apart, to the point where he was an outcast with his other squad members in his unit, was just pitiful. No friends? Kept to himself. Whatever. The only true interest in this story was John's relationship with his father. I'm going to stick with Spark's movies only."
3,Hard Sell,"I normally like all of the books by Nicholas Sparks, and I would have liked this one, if not for the fact that my husband himself has been to Iraq and I know firsthand that wives and girlfriends are usually warned beforehand that delicate news can endanger the life of the soldier. I found it a hard sell that a girl claiming to love a man so deeply could knowingly endanger someones life, though I am sure that wasn't how it was intended. It's probably a better book for someone to read if their husband didn't return from Iraq in the last three months."
3,A little disapointed.,"I know that everybody it writing such great reviews about this book, but i am not sure i agree. I loved most of it, and thought it was a great love story, and could not put it down just like everyone else. I was for some reason really disapointed though. I think i am ready for him to make a happy book. The past two books to me have turned out poorly and i am ready for a happy ending such as The Wedding! I really hope Sparks adds some light at the end of the tunnel for his next book, and I really hope it doesn't take as long this time to get this book out."
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping to like this book since of course the Notebook by Nicholas Sparks was such a huge success. This book was very one dimensional and elementary. The book was predictable and the characters became annoying after awhile because they were so whiny. Perhaps this is Nicholas Sparks style, but if you are looking for an interesting, unpredictable love story that wasn't written for a 13 year old, this isn't for you."
1,Couldn't make it past page 70,"I read ""The Notebook"" a few years ago and loved it. Read ""A Walk to Remember"" a couple of years later, and thought it was ok. Picked up ""Dear John"" this week and I just can't stand it. The writing is just bad, period. The characters are so predictable. I think I've grown out of Nicholas Sparks. There are much better books out there - life's too short to read this stuff."
1,Very Disappointing,"Absolutely the most depressing book I've ever read. Well written and kept my attention, but I was very disappointed with the ending."
1,Longing for Something More,"This story lacked something that I feel is fundamentally required for a love story to be functional. And Nicholas needs to write a new story line, not Rich girl loves Poor guy who can never be together after one great summer fling, and then years of agony go by before anything comes back together for the couple...COME ON.And the movie is not anything close to what you would expect after reading the book."
2,love sparks but disappointed with this book.,i love n. sparks and this book was great until the end. i dint think it was fair the soldier didnt get a happy ending. if any one deserves a happy ending its hi. sorry this review is horribly written. im writing it on my kindle.
5,"hugs, kisses, and tears","I absolutely loved this book!! I finished it in 2 days, I just couldn't put it down!!"
5,I cried! It was so good.,This was another great Nicholas Sparks book. It is a very emotional and gripping love story - which of course is Nicholas Sparks' speciality. I love him as an author and can't wait for the next story. Highly recommended!
4,"A great story, but such a sad ending!","As always, I absolutely ate through this latest Nicholas Sparks novel. Romantic, a page-turner, a great story!! However, I'd have to agree with previous reviewers that I'm ready for a happy ending--mix 'em up now and then with the tear-jerkers."
1,Ending ruined the book,"I really enjoyed this book but just couldn't believe the ending. I know that I should be prepare for it after reading first chapter, but somehow I though there is no way these two won't be together.I would give it 5 stars if only the ending would be different.After reading that John sold his dad's coins that he was collecting for all his life to save Tim ( by the way he didn't have any guarantee that he will save his life! And who would do that after the guy stole the love of his life?! ).And to write that the realetionship between John and Savannah would never work after all that happened to them!!!! How in the world relationship with Tim would ????? Obviousely Savannah is still madely in love with Jim and still looking up to the moon and thinking about him constantly.How Tim can be with her knowing that? This just shows how nice guy he is.....The ending made me feel like I wasted my time on this book. I will never read Sparks book again."
2,"""Dear John""","Dear John,Next time fate smiles on you: Finish your time in the Army, let fate take its course with the husband of the women you love, Marry your soul mate, raise the autistic child of the fore mentioned,and now deceased, husband of the woman you love, keep your father's coin collection to honor his memory, have two children with your soul mate, and... OK finally sell the coins to pay for your children's education.Yours truley, sanityP.S. Have fun howling at the moon every month...you bleeding heart sapp!!!"
4,Got so involved in the story.. Really enjoyed it!,"This was the first book I read from Nicholas Sparks and I really enjoyed it; couldn't put it down and was angsty to finish it! After I started reading it, I found out that he was the author of The Notebook (one of my favorite movies) and A Walk to Remember (liked it), so I knew it was going to be a good read... and he didn't let me down! I loved the way Nicholas Sparks described every emotion that went on with the characters, by the end of the book I felt like I had lived that story myself, as if I knew John and Savannah. Looking forward to reading more of his books, and for the movie to come out!"
3,Good beginning bad ending,The first two parts of the book are excellent you won't be able to put the book down. The third part is boring and almost doesn't have to do anything with the main plot. If this part had been written in less than 50 pages the book could be wonderful. While reading the last hundred pages you'll forget how good were the first parts.
4,Dear John Book Review,"""Dear John"" is the approiately named book by Nicholas Sparks that tells a story about a obstinate boy who falls in love with the girl of his dreams at one of the worst possible times. Right as he is about to go back to his infantry in Germany. With only months left of his tour, John and Savannah frequently write letters back and forth. After 9/11, John feels that it is his patriotic duty to reenlist. Even though Savannah is averse to this, she beguiles him and leads him on to believe that she's okay with everything. Letters become less and less frequent and it's obvious that their once love was slowly fading. John tells himself that once he completes his deployment everything will be okay. The next and final letter he recieves from Savannah is the true ""Dear John"" letter... I'd recommend this book to any Nicholas Sparks fan and anyone interested in a real tear jerker. It's one of his best novels and is a modern day romance novel between a soldier and his sweetheart back home."
3,The book is a nice book,I like the book and the movie. I got the book so i could watch the movie. I read the book first. It shipped in a timely manner.
4,great read,"This was my first nicholas sparks book and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. And I look forward to reading more of his books. I think that any book that makes you feel some kind of emotion whether it makes me laugh or cry, as long as I feel something while reading then that book is a success and I definitely had alot of emotion while reading Dear John. Hope everyone else enjoys it as much as I did."
4,More than a Romance,"Nicholas Sparks does not write ""formulaic"" romance with happy endings. But readers know if they're in the mood for a good tear-jerker, they can pick up a Sparks novel. It's a tear-jerker because Sparks is a master at creating characters the reader cares about.I especially enjoy characters that struggle with issues other than (and in addition to) a complicated romance. (Although in my own writing I'm more of a happily-ever-after kind of gal.)Dear John is about what happens to a relationship when one of the participants is in the military (a theme I often explore in my writing). It also has a strong sub-theme with John's father (who is assumed to have Asbergers).All in all, a typical Sparks ""hero"" - complex, deep - who loses a lot but still manages to keep the reader's admiration! My only complaint is that our hero was a bit too mushy at times (which may just be my expectations of a soldier character)."
2,Not his best,I actually found this book boring. At times I had to make myself keep reading. I couldn't idenitify with the characters.
2,Easy to read;predictible;sad,The only thing I really liked about this book was the father of the main character. He was quirky and different and throughout the book you begin to understand why. The rest of it reminded me of a Soap on television. I would recommend this read to anyone who wanted to kill time on a plane ride or just needed something easy to read that would not make you think. Otherwise read the paper.
5,Dear John,"This is a beautiful and romantic story of a young couple who fall in love after meeting at the beach in North Carolina during the summer one year. John is an Army Sergeant on leave and Savannah is a college girl helping to build homes for Habitat for Humanity. They notice each other for the first time on the boardwalk. Savannah's purse falls from her shoulder into the water, John dives in and rescues it while the Frat boys stand and watch. She notices then he is a caring and tender man, although not her type with large tattoos and a crew cut. Shortly afterward, they begin an unforgettable summer romance. Unfortunately, John must return to the Balkans where he is stationed. Additional stress is added because John is so far away and then later reenlists for another term. The book is about true love, commitment and caring about another's needs above our own. It is truly inspirational!"
1,Disappointed!!!,"Let me start by saying.... I LOVE NICHOLAS SPARKS. I was very disappointed in this book. I thought the charactors were not believable. The middle of the book was slow, more about the war then the love story. I give all his books a 5 star, but just not this one."
3,Not quite up to Sparks Standards.,"I would like to start by saying that I have read most of Nicholas Sparks books. I've loved each one and awaited the arrival of the next.However I am only 2/3 through Dr. John and am forcing myself to finish. Sparks usually draws his readers into his books and you can really feel like part of the scenes. Like a by-stander in the room. Maybe it is that the subject matter, while real, is not something I want to read for enjoyment.I'll finish the book and if my opinion changes I'll up my rating but for now, I think I'll reread ""The Notebook"" or ""The Wedding"" or something else I can really become a part of."
2,Dissappointed,"I was dissappointed when I read this book. Normally, I rush out and buy every book he writes, then I can't stop reading them. When I finished this one, I just sat there and thought, ""Wow, that was just not good."" All that anticipation for a book, then I am not even satisfied. I will have to try his next one."
2,Dear John (means goodbye),"I was a little disappointed in this novel - I was hoping for a happy ending & it came up short. I don't want to give it away, but the book was really good till the end, I just wasn't happy with the ending. Otherwise, it made me cry & laugh through out the book. Recommending it is hard since I wasn't too happy."
1,A reason to swear off this author,"Having read several of his other books and enjoyed his storylines, I expected a modicum of character development. This book was thinly written and provided no plausability or engagement with any of the characters."
3,"Ehh, ok","Johns view on his life was in great description. I felt like I knew him and felt like I was there in the story. However, I feel like the emotion was missing. There was hardly a moment that I felt on edge except for maybe when his father passes away while he's away. That was sad, but overall a great read for someone who likes romance novels with out the dirty details :)"
3,Dear John by Nicholas Sparks,"I love all of Nicholas Sparks's books, but this one was a little different for me. Although I found the idea of the book inspiring, and the movie looks flawless, I found myself skipping significant parts of the book. Others found this book very emotional, and I simply did not. I liked the twist, though. The typical love story always involves a happy ending, and although the ending may not spark happiness immediately. I felt a sense of accomplishment, almost. Like John and Savannah have learned to accept their differences and are able to successfully move on with their lives without losing each other all together."
3,Really 2.5 stars,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but this book did nothing for me. It was just OK. At one point, I thought about putting it down and reading another book instead, but I stuck with it. I just wanted something, anything to happen but it droned on about the same old thing."
5,Excellent,"I love Sparks and all of his books and Dear John is just a great over all story of what alot of people are going through right now being in the Army and how it is so hard to have a relationship. But this is a great book and I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who is a Sparks fan, or who just likes to read."
2,"Wildly mediocre, very disappointing","I honestly can't understand the gushing reviews for this simplistic, bland novel. About half way through I went back to Amazon to see if this was in the young-adult category, because that's how it reads: Teenaged, uncomplicated, lacking in depth and complex emotion and very self-indulgent. There's very little real storyline here and it's full of page after page of incredibly stilted and trite dialogue. I not only wasn't invested in what happened next to the characters, I actually couldn't care less."
2,"LOVE John Tyree, hate Savannah - spoilers","I really loved the character of John Tyree but could not stand Savannah. She did not deserve such a man. What a horrible ending for this book, though I am very glad John did not get stuck with her for the rest of his life. He deserves so much better.The only reason I gave this book 2 stars was because I cared for John so much, and for his father, too. In fact, in my mind, the love story of this book was between John and his dad.Whatever you do, DO NOT listen to this audiobook. The narrator is HORRIBLE."
3,Just OK,"I've read all of Nicholas Sparks' previous novels and this is one of my least favorites...maybe it's cause I just couldn't relate the prim and proper female character or really feel a part of this ""great connection"" they supposedly had. The relationship between John and his Dad is very touching as is the end but not sure I'd recommend this to anyone."
3,Depths of Heart,"Nicholas Sparks, takes the reader deep into the depths of the human heart with DEAR JOHN. The strongest contrast in characterization is Savannah Lynn Curtis, who constantly exhibits intuition and strength of purpose, but emotionally is drained by separation. I was delighted to discover a southern novel that used war and responsibility instead of religion to bring about change and growth in the narrator. A Sparks story that is stark in contrast.Perfect to take to the beach.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
5,nicholas sparks is an amazing writer,This novel is so sad yet so inspiring. i love all his books and this novel def topped them. every novel gets better and better.
3,"Alright, kind of empty...","I had only read one other Nicholas Sparks novel before this one ('The Notebook', which I loved), and I had not seen the movie adaptation before reading this novel (now I have, didn't care for it). I thought this was an okay book, it felt kind of empty to me though. I felt like there wasn't enough character development in this book, I really didn't care what happened to either of the two main characters. The thing that I was most interested in was the relationship between John and his father. I liked that story and would have enjoyed a longer story based on that alone. I was just disappointed in this book. I had had high hopes for it, had heard very good things about it. I was let down, unfortunately. I did not like the ending at all. I can't get into it on here without giving away too much, but I will say that I didn't find it believable at all. I don't see that situation ever happening in real life, ever. It was put in to seem romantic and selfless, but it backfired."
4,"Dear Nicholas Sparks, keep writing novels like this one.","I have always been skeptical about romance novels and must confess I was never a fan of The Notebook or A Walk to Remember. However, throughout the years I have become noticeably more interested in Nicholas Sparks novels. Dear John is an addiction and I couldn't put it down. I admire Sparks' ability to create real characters and prove to his readers that happy endings do not always occur the way we would like. Its not as good as The Last Song, but it is a novel you dont want to miss."
4,Bittersweet and Pretty Predictable,"Well...what can I say? I'm a sucker for Nicholas Sparks, and picked this up in paperback the other day. I finished it in about a day, it was a pretty easy read.The characters were likeable, but the storyline felt a little lacking. Knowing that Sparks books pretty much always have a sad spin, it wasn't hard to figure out the ending. I was not surprised, it ended exactly as I figured, but the ending did seem a bit too...perfectly bittersweet.I won't give any spoilers, just suffice to say, if you like Sparks other melancholy romances, you will enjoy this one. No surprises, but Sparks knows how to write emotions, thats for sure!"
3,"Entertaining, but predictable","This book wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. I felt like the story dragged on a little and just had some fillers. I usually love his books, but I felt like this one was pretty predictable. It was entertaining though, and I did enjoy it for the most part. I just didn't feel satisfied that I got much out of the spending the whole day reading it."
5,Simply fantastic!!!,"Sparks' magic at work! I felt as if I was in love and right there in the middle of everything! It made me realize how passionate two people could be. Sparks' has created another ""The Notebook"". With him holding the pen anyone can fall in love."
4,more the same,"I title this ""more the same"", that's exactly what it is. If you've read Nicholas Spark's other novels chances are you found this one as predictable as I. don't get me wrong Sparks is my favorite author. I look forward to each new book he has out. He has a talent for really making charaters come alive. However, unfortunaely for those of uswho do read all his books his writing style is becoming a lttle too transparent. I knew Svannah would end up with Tim from chaper one when they intorduced his character. Still worth reading, especially if you haven't read many of his books yet!"
1,none,i am really upset till this day i haven't receive this book and i order it for my daughter on the 1/16/10 and she's looks forward too reading it i guess that if i don't hear from amazon i will no longer shop here that's too bad because i am a regular customer...
2,Depressing!!,"This is the most depressing book I've ever read. By the time I was done with it, I was sad and mad about all the unfortunate events that John had to go through and yet he can still be so generous and love the other unconditionally. I mean.. really?? I know it's fiction, but it's a bit unrealistic there. I understand that with a memorable ending, it will make readers come back for more, but this just about crossed the line for me. This is the first Nicholas Sparks book that I don't like. I would have given it 1 star, but he is a great storyteller so I say 2."
2,Not a true hardcover book,"I specifically ordered this book to replace a library book that had been lost. The library required the hardcover edition, which the description says it is. But it is not - it is basically a softcover sized book that has a hard cover on it - the size of a typical ""pocket novel."" It is not a full sized hardcover edition. My library wouldn't even accept it. So if that is important at all to you, this is not the right edition.Dear John"
5,A rare jewel,"This is truly a wonderful story. Nicholas Sparks is a master storyteller. Dear John is positively captivating. It's heartfelt, realistic and bittersweet. The ending was surprising, but fitting. The absolute tale of what anyone that loves, truly loves someone would do. I highly recommend- just as good as A Walk to Remember!"
4,Good Book,"I've never read a romance novel, but my wife got me to watch The Notebook and I thought it was a pretty decent movie. I decided to get this book for my Kindle and, after the somewhat slow start, I got into it. It's a really good story with a great ending. Of course the ending is debatable by some, but I enjoyed it. My wife and I are going to watch the movie tonight. I have a feeling I will be let down by the movie, as it always is when you read the book first. I already see certain things I don't like, such as the fact that the actor doesn't have any tattoos or muscles and he seems like much more of a ""pretty boy"" than Sparks describes him. I am still curious to see how it is. 4 stars only because I'm still not sold on romance novels."
4,"good, easy read","I wasn't expecting that much from this book. I loved the Notebook but I know that Sparks is an easy going writer and easy to digest. I read this quickly, snowed in from a blizzard and it was exactly what I wanted, easy romantic fluff. Nice beach read."
2,With the hype of the movie I thought I would review....,"This book. Read it years ago and thought this was not up to the standard of lets see maybe the ""The Notebook"" !!! Terriable!!"
3,slow middle,"Very good beginning and good ending, although predictable. The middle was so slow, I almost could not finish the book. Bored me to tears. I struggled to make it through to the the ending"
1,"Accents are so terrible, we had to turn it off","My aunt and I had an 18-hour drive from the south back to NYC and decided to get a book on cd to pass the time. I love Nicholas Sparks, he is a wonderful writer, but the audio version of Dear John. I wanted so badly to enjoy the reader's story, but his accents were terribly cringe-worthy. We were trying so hard to listen past his voice and just hear the story, but it was inevitable--we had to shut it off. I was terribly disappointed. My theory was that the actor chosen to read for this had to be dashingly handsome. My theory was correct--he is gorgeous. But.....it's audio......?......If you can stand horrible southern accents that create an illusion of the characters as being unsympathetic and cold, then purchase this book on cd. However, I strongly discourage it."
5,best book ever!!,"I am not much of a reader, but I loved this book. I had a hard time putting it down.... LOVED IT!!"
1,Very disappointed,"I recieved this audio book with a note on the second disc that stated that the disc was very scratched up and didn't play much at all. They were right, it was ruined. I can't figure why they would send it in the condition it was in knowing the person recieving it would be most disappointed, as I certainly was. dl"
1,Dear John was amazing!,"I have learned while reading Nicholas Sparks to never underestimate his abilities to catch you in the beginning and keep you there until the very end. Dear John is a wonderful love story that makes you realize sometimes life is not always a cup of tea, and opens your heart to the possiblity that love, as strong as it might be, might not last through the changing lifestyles and triumphs of time. Great story, amazing ending. I loved this book, I even bought a copy for my grandmother!!"
5,Sparks Does it Again,"Great story of a young love with a heart-wrenching ending. Sparks manages to pull off some subtle twists and turns without using a fear mechanism. Great, fast read."
3,Hardcover Option is Misleading,"I've been trying to find this book in hardcover for a long time. When I was able to find it on Amazon, I was happy. However, I was expecting a book that looks like the average hardcover book complete with jacket. The book I received was the size of a mass market paperback with no jacket. It resembles something that I'd find in the library. Just be aware that none of that is listed, it just says hardcover."
5,Such a good lovestory,"I really enjoyed this book but if you see the movie you will notice that it does not end the same way the book does and obviously the book has more details, so it is always good to read the book first or see the movie to exchange different points of view of the novel.I liked better the end of the movie though."
4,In awe,"As a military wife, this book broke my heart. But it was worth all the tears I put into it. Defiantly a book to read."
4,Amazing.,Amazing book- but utterly predictable. I would like for anybody to read this book. I loved it. One of the best.
3,not at all like the movie,"I saw the movie first, but enjoyed the book. It's a good book to lose yourself in if you're a little weepy."
4,Great book,I love Nicholas Sparks books. This book kept me reading wanting more. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good love story.
2,Cliche after Cliche,"I have read several other Nicholas Sparks books in the past so I knew not to expect literature, but rather a quick easy read. Unfortunately, this book offered up only cliche after cliche. After reading the first couple chapters, I could tell you exactly what was going to happen (although there were some twists that added a little to the story, which is why I gave it 2 stars). Sparks really needed an update in conversational language that people use today, because these two sounded nothing like 20 somethings around 2001, especially Savannah who sounded like a 50's era character most of the time. He also relies to heavily on letter writing and completely ignores modern ways soldiers and their families keep in touch. This couple has none of the magic or spark of Noah and Allie in the Notebook."
5,great purchase,great book- wonderful movie -- very innocent and romantic that is about it it it it it it it it
4,Wife Book,"Got this for my wife who is the book reader in the family, she likes the book a lot, a must have she says."
3,Great Theme,"I realy enjoyed this book overall. Their were a few parts that were kind of slow,especially in the beginning. But once the story progressed, it got better.The story starts off as John is a troubled kid, with a father he does not relate too. He is at the beach and falls in love with a girl named Savannah. They hit it off, and hang together for awhile, until he has to go back to germany where he is stationed. He is about to get out of the military and then 911 happened. He wants to do his country a favor or the right thing and reenlist. After he does this, the couples problems start to happen.The end is good, if you love someone, you do anything to make them happy. No matter what that is."
1,Novel..Dear John,Predictably terrible writing. I'm half way through the book and rapidly skimming. I won't be too anxious to buy another Nicholas Sparks book.
3,Teenage Indulgence,"This book bored me. Maybe that is because I'm not fifteen. I found it indulgent, obvious, and simple minded. The only thing that really interested me was the relationship between John and his father and this is not really central to the story. This book lacked in passion and depth."
3,Just ok,"I had several people recommend this book to me so I decided to read it. I liked the second half of the book much better than the first, but overall I just felt it was way too sappy and unrealistic."
1,i couldn't stop reading until..............,i got to the mid part of the book first everithing is good summer goodlooking guy on the beach dating the summer they ' re in love bla bla but then the guy chooses the army over her and later on her huband is sick and he sells his father coins to save him no guy would do that ok no a very realistic story
4,Not like the others,"This book was very moving, but it wasn't one of the better Sparks books. And it didn't end in typical Sparks fashion I believe. But still overall, it is a good read."
4,Another great book.........,Nicholas Sparks continues to amaze me with his touching stories. I always look forward to another one of his.........
4,Heartbreaking Story,I love Nicholas Sparks books! This one was another great that I couldn't put down....even though it left me very sad the next day. I felt so sorry for John through the whole book! The thing I didn't like about this book was the ending (hoping the movie has a better one). If you are a Sparks fan you will love this book!
3,Boring,"I hate saying boring about any of Nicholas Sparks books, but this is what I have found in the past few I've read. I want the old Nicholas back, 'Notebook, Time in a Bottle', etc. I have found the recent ones are like watching soap operas, which I do not watch. Maybe the new one coming out soon will be the old Nicholas.Rm Lamatt"
2,"A well developed, poorly concluded book","This is a book that started off with good character development and a solid story line, however the ending lacks any moral consequences for the woman who left a fighting soldier cold, in the dust, and cheated on him.This is a book written for women who have cheated on a man, felt guilty about it, then need to read something to make them feel absolved of all guilt.This is not a book for most men and definitely NOT a book that you would want ANY soldier to read.The ending lacked the intelligence and craft found in the beginning of the story, and it is not a book that I would recommend for anyone to read."
2,This book left me way too sad!,"I have enjoyed so many of this author's books. When I finished this one, I was bummed out for two days. I understand the importance of honor and choices, but the ending could have embraced both and still not have been so unfulfilling. It's a long book, I invested many hours reading it. I did not like the unhappy ending."
5,Good read,"This book is an easy read. It has the same elements of all of his other books. If you like Nicholas Sparks, you will like this book."
1,Must remember to play back the reminder,This product seems like a great idea for someone with memory problems except for a major flaw in the design: one must remember to push the playback button to get their reminder. The design would have been much more useful if it had a digital time set function that played back the message after so many minutes and/or at a certain time.
2,This boat barely floats.,"Ouch. I should have read the reviews before forking over the dough. I had no choice, really - the kids found it at the grocery store check-out. The kids liked it - they didn't notice that the animation was no better than 1960's Hanna-Barberra cartoons and that the story was 3 stories awkwardly stitched together. If you liked the moral theme of Atlantis, don't ruin it with this dumbed-down cartoony follow-up. The orignal Atlantis was a visually stunning masterpiece of animation almost in the league of The Lion King and Fantasia. This DVD is not nearly worthy of the Disney name ..."
1,BACK TO HELL FROM WHICH YOU CAME! 2.25 OUT OF 10,"Atlantis: Milo's Return is absolutely horrible, and there is almost nothing good to be had from this craptacular movie experience, except divine hatred for all things about Disney sequels. The plot is simply too hard to figure out, and it will only piss you off when you're able to figure out some parts of it. Everything good about the original has gone horribly wrong in its hellish sequel. The original actors are basically no where to be found in the sequel, which also ruins the experience. The artwork doesn't seem very good either, and will only make you wonder how a Disney movie can manage that. If you value your soul, please avoid this awful movie at all costs if you don't wish to get a glimpse of hell."
1,"Do not rent, and definetively do not buy!!","Probably the worst Disney-release I have ever seen, badly drawn, and no ""movie"" at all, it is a collection of three different, but thin(!) stories. In other words; not the usual Disney-charm on this one."
5,Better than expected,"My grandson was looking for this movie. I found it here on Amazon at a great price. It arrived quickly, and I was impressed by the condition of it. Amazon.com continues to exceed my expectations! Thank you Amazon and Movieswanted for an excellent product!"
2,Only a Video Release,"I bought this DVD. I do like Disney cartoons, but I'm also a big Anime fan. I did buy Treasure Planet, Spirit Stallion of the Cimmeron, and Spirited Away. I have a whole list of collections of cartoons, but I have to admit the original theatrical movie is much better than the video release sequal.First of all the characters look very different. For a 2 hour movie, they put three different adventures into it. They should have just kept the story to one big adventure. Also, I'm not too sure but the voice actors might also be different. There is definitely a lack of a evil villan in this sequal.I would not recommend this dvd. I would prefer you buy the new release of Star Trek Nemesis instead. It just also came out at the same time."
1,Disappointed,"Although this dvd was supposed to be in very good condition, it had a serious scratch that prevented my little boy from watching the whole movie. It's one of his favorites, so we're very disappointed."
1,Atlantis,The dvd was received cracked. therefore it was too much trouble to return it to the states so I threw it away. thank you
2,Oh Please,"First off, Atlantis was probably the worst movie in history and now Disney is making as sequel!? And I think Disney must have copied the name for the giant octopus because ""Kraken"" is Octopus in German."
5,This movie was better than what people give it credit for.,"I am 15 years old (16 in august 2004). I enjoyed the movie. Even though one actor died and they could not rehire the another, thier voices almost matched. Even though the animation was made for Atlantis: The T.V. Series, the animation was still good! The only thing I did not like, was the plot progression, it went too quickly. Besides that, it was still was a great movie!"
3,Television Pilot,"This movie was really the first three episodes of a series based on the movie. After the movie pulled in weak returns in the theaters, the series was scrapped. However there episodes made and thus merged together to be this movie. The series would have featured Milo going all over the world and running into other characters from the movie. Pendding the sales of this movie, the series may get the green light."
1,way lame,"I really liked the first one of these and got excited about the second, but its just lame. the characters don't even look the same ( or have the same voices ) and its just horrible. Looks like some crappy tv show or something bad dunno. not worth more then 3 dollars. lol"
2,Definitely a rental. Seems like a Saturday morning cartoon episode.,Definitely a rental. Seems like a Saturday morning cartoon episode. I'd pass. It's great for little kids though. Have fun watching.
5,Atlantis,Another great deal on a wonderful children's movie. This movie was priced very well and arrived more quickly than I expected.
3,I'm glad that you had it.,My daughter Skyla will be amazed. I did Try your website For it and there it was. It is what she wanted.
2,Cobra 9551,This radar doesnt really catch much it will tell you somthing is there right in front of your face u will catch a cop with your eye before the radar will. Plus now a days cops dont turn there radar on untill cars are pasing them so they can clock u without u havieng a warning of the radar blinking
1,waste of money,This was just was not a good product at all it does not really work right about the only things that works good is the compass that is build into it.
4,Surprisingly good,"When I first heard of this comic, I was less than thrilled to read it. In fact, I didn't even pick it up until a good five years after it came out. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised.Writing a series of adventures from Jabba's point of view is no mean feat, but the authors do a superb job. Jabba is presented as true to his movie vision (more so in A New Hope Special Edition than Return of the Jedi, but these are supposed to be his early days), and the adventure and action are very Jabba-ish. More importantly, there are some real sci-fi elements, which are sometimes lacking in other SW adventures.Basically, this comic series was an excellent recapture of the SW comics that came out back in the days when SW was young, both in theme and artwork. This is a good, short, fun read, and a nice addition to the Star Wras universe."
3,Worth a look!,"Although the cartoonish look (very reminiscent of the Star Wars Early Adventures by the same artist who created Magnus-Robot Warrior (I forget his name!)) is off-putting at first, the bizarre humour as well as the portrayal of Jabba as sort of an intergalactic Sydney Greenstreet (think ""Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"") make this collection quite amusing, if not outstanding."
2,written by a 11 year old,first off i dont mean to knock this TPB. it was quite fun to read... and gave me a few good laughs.... my problem with it is that the dialogue is really campy and cheesy. the premise is that jabba is going around robbing people (the art of the deal is the title... the deal is that he rips you off... so he always wins... get it?? lol) The art reminds me of something that i drew when i was day dreaming and doodleing in grade school. to make a long story short... but it for $1.54... but dont pay much more for it... the end
4,Songs for WOMAN,"This CD is nice for woman and make you laugh because is very logical about men. What I mean is when we want to go to dance, they say they are tired and want to sleep. Sometimes I get mad the same as the singer! So for pretty music and also good joking for the men, listen to this CD."
4,Review,"Love the cell phone cover! The bottom fits very snug, but the top slides more than I think it should."
4,Very Helpful Book,This book is above average in bringing to your table the parts of a publicity project. It disects the task and offers bite sized pieces to work on. The book includes a section for people new at writing--with lots of examples. If you are responsible for the publicity/Public Relations of your company or organization--this is the book for you!
3,Dominoes Again,"I bought this item for my little cousin this past Christmas. He plays with it occasionally but prefers regular dominoes. There are so many versions of dominoes out but alot of the kids I talk to prefer just regular ones. All of that said, this product was still somewhat fun to play with, however I think it is meant for younger kids than what the box actually says."
3,Ok,"The book is about Denzel, an African-American high school senior in Brooklyn, NY. Denzel gets accepted to Princeton and goes for a six-week course in the summer for students who have a lot of potential but who may need some help to be able to compete with students from more privileged backgrounds. Denzel finds he can't slide through the program like he slid through high school which causes him to reconsider his future.This book deals very honestly with issues such as racism and class. I enjoyed the fact that the book takes place in Brooklyn, NY because I spent this past summer there and really loved my time there. I did not like this book much because I thought that Denzel was too cocky and cold-hearted. I'm not sure if I would recommend this book to kids or not-maybe to kids that are similar to Denzel and come from a similar background. It may also be valuable to show kids from the Midwest and the suburbs what life is like for a minority from an urban background."
4,Fast Talk on a Slow Track,I beleive that this book is an average book. Many people really would enjoy this book if they like hearing about other peoples problems.
1,disappointment,"I was disappointed to see that i did not receive the CDs I had ordered. I had put in an order for the Discover the Classics Vol. 2 and received in the correct box two CDs from the band ""REM"".It is an unfortunate lack of attention by the sender, however to repair the damage I would have to make who knows how many phone calls and probably undergo more frustration and, of course, spend more money.More attention is definitively needed. I give one star because there is no option for zero."
2,Pas tres bien ma belle,"I'm not carzy about this CD. I have some previous Dion CDs in french, and they are all great, but ths one... not. She shouts too much, the music composition lacks of talent. Dommage"
5,Great album from a great singer,"She did it again, what a great album.. all songs are great. Even if you don't understand French you will love it.This is must for everyone who loves Celine DionThe most songs that I love1. Je Ne Suis Pas Celle2. Je Cherche l'Ombre3. Lettre de George Sand a Alfred de Musset"
3,Not my favorite of Celine's albums,"I can't get into this one, and I'm a real big fan of Celine. I think the problem I have with it is that, unlike her other albums, the songs on D'elles don't seem to have a climax to them. I don't get the feelings behind the songs. I love Celine in both French and English but this album doesn't rank as a favorite for me."
3,good buy if you get it cheap,I still like her in English better as the songs written for her there seem to be more vocally dynamic but this is also a good buy if you get it for cheap. Fun to listen to.
4,Nice book!,Nice book with some good wedding ideas! NIce color photos of each cake listed. Not quite as many as I thought there would be but they do list what you need for each one and it has the wilton techniques as all their books do. Also has wedding cake supply order numbers. Overall a nice book.
2,Maybe 2 1/2 stars - A silly book,"The idea that an angel would fall in love with a man is interesting, but the man is completely uninteresting, as is the parallel story of the man's fortunes and ever-growing family -- may of whom are just names to confuse the reader. There is a side story of a murderer, who cares? There are some discussions between the angel and the man, not very well done. The chapters are mostly short, corresponding to the annual visits -- an old writer's trick to avoid having to write a cohesive story. The author writes well enough, but I'd think only readers of fantasy would actually like this book."
4,Thoughtful Relationship Driven Fantasy,"It takes about a 100 pages for this book to begin to attract the reader and really involve one in the characters. The structure is built around each chapter being one year in the life of Sabran Jodeau. Every year, he meets with Xas, an angel with a past we learn progressively with Sabran. These encounters alter Sabran's life more than once within the story and the lives of those surrounding him. One interesting reversal during an age of post Enlightenment is what would an atheist (not Sobran, but Aurora, an intelligent woman of his acquaintance) react to the knowledge that angels and therefore God actually exist. Although the theology isn't as detailed as I'd hoped, still, the ideas presented in this book are thoughtful. Recommended for fantasy enthusiasts looking for something a bit different. This book would also be of interest to those who pursue literature featuring homosexual themes."
2,"well, the book and the movie","have both tested my logic. first of all, we got to make sure whether the gender of the so-called ""angel"" is something beyond male or female or in between. does it have to be a male or female? or is it just a unisex? or a creature(or creation) without a gender or a gender in between; either this or that? does the angel also get sexual desire, lust or homosexual identity crisis? the scene about the angel in this book has also made me think that an angel's body weight must be as light as an eagle or sparrow, otherwise, no matter how strong and how big those feather wings on the back, the gravity will simply stop them from taking off and flying away. the most ridiculous ones are those fat baby-like angels with those tiny wings on the back. are those baby angels drink milk to grow up into adult angels? do they need to attend flying school to get flying licenses or permits? every time before they fly down to the earth, do they have to file fly plans?"
1,"worst kitsch since ""memnoch the devil""","it's such a hard task to combine sex and the spiritual that I wish writers gave up trying! there is one single idea in this book (fallen angel falling in love with human) and this is not really worth the trouble, the rest is decoration and the desperate attempt to create a Anne-Riceish atmosphere. fake philosophy, fake emotions, dreadful ""theology"" and bad storytelling too.one star for the wings though: they are pretty!"
1,The Vinter's luck will be your bad luck,"Tedious in the extreme - other reviewers read it in one night, I took three months. Boring story, dreadful writing with pretensions to prose. Glad its all over. Sorry Lucy and Elise - worst birthday present EVER !!"
1,Dreadful piece of garbage,"I cannot fathom why this book has received such great reviews. Maybe the author has many friends whom she asked to write positive feedback on Amazon. It is crass, poorly written and tends towards the maudlin. I can't even bring myself to finish it. Don't waste your time or money."
4,"Lovely, but not quite what I expected","I bought this book on the strength of the spiel on the cover, and whereas it is a very good book with strong well defined characters, it was not quite what I expected. The Angel Xas is definitely the centre of the story, but (and perhaps foolishly) I expected a gentler and more angelic character. So if you're looking for the standard story of beautiful angels with wings that smell of snow, this is not for you. That aside it is still an engrossing and clever read, and I do recommend it."
2,odd writing,"I gave up about three quarters of the way through. I would read passages that I thought beautifully written and interesting, but as the story progressed, the characters became many and unnecessary. Persons that started out significant became lost in the threads of the insignificant. Someone described it as choppy. That seems fitting. Too long on miracles and short on continuity for my taste."
5,Fanciful Beautiful Moving,"I loved this story. As Elizabeth said in a recent interview - a dream she had to write. I laughed out loud many times - sometimes from the humour, sometimes from the beauty, once or twice from the horror of human existence, and once when Lucifer turned up! I just finished it this morning - and I am here at Amazon.com about to buy it and send it as birthday presents to friends overseas."
3,Don't usually like these kinds of books but gave it a chance,"I don't usually care for these kinds of books, but read so much about the author that I thought I'd give it a chance; I was pleasantly surprised. I'm hoping Ms. Knox writes another novel soon. Her style is quite refreshing."
4,Interesting and fun!!,"This product is interesting and just a little different than your average Lego product. I purchased it for my 12 year old nephew who had ADHD and has a really tough time staying interested in one thing for very long. He loves to read and learn. He opened the box up right after opening the gift for his birthday, and workked non-stop until he built his first project. Even the adults and the the other kids, including the girls were interested. I wish this product came with a storage container or bag to keep everything together, and I wish the price wias a little more reasonable. I love that the different sets work together to have extra pieces. Great purchase!"
2,Love the item - but the book inside was flawed,"Missing about 20 pages, just have not had time to resolve with the company. Who does really, you expect that a book would have all the pages. Really! Get a new printer."
5,Delightfully fragrant body lotion at an attractive price,Very happy to find this fine product at an affordable price. It is a superior product from a well known cosmetic manufacturer.
4,entertaining,"this dvd was very informative, and entertaining. james brown performs with so much heart and soul it is unbelievable. his energy level is through the roof, i'm really glad i have it in my collection. the only reason i gave it 4 stars was because due to the technical difficulty that the network experienced during recording the concert, it was blocked out for a few minutes, but james more than made up for that, it was like you didn't miss a beat. the audio was not that great but if you have a surround sound system like i do you can kinda make it work. a must have for serious music lovers."
5,History On DVD,"Classic must see DVD, Master preformer with lot's of Heart.... On stage he was the Original. He put on a show that saved a city from burning!!! keep in mind, that the quality of the video is lacking. But it's the content that matters..."
2,James Brown Review,This concert was not very well recorded. I did not appreciate the constant disturbance during the concert and I could not hear or see the band playing.
1,Disappointing,"It has been forty years since I saw James Brown live in concert, and I still remember how much I enjoyed watching him perform. When I saw this peformance listed on Amazon and read some of the reviews, I couldn't wait to get the DVD. What a disappointment!First of all, the disc I received was defective. The last two songs would not play, and my BluRay player started making a clicking sound like the laser head was banging against the wall. Second, I knew the concert was filmed in black and white, but I wasn't expecting the lighting to be so bad. It looked like the theatre lights were turned off. Besides James, most everything else was a shadow. Third, the camera angles were beyond amateurish. There were a lot shots taken from behind with the view of James partially blocked. Some of the shots didn't show his feet until the dance moves were almost over. Fourth, the quality of the sound was poor. The DVD looked like the thing was shot in the early 1950's. not 1968."
4,For James Brown Fan...no matter what,"Closely resembles a bootleg dvd but if it's sold on Amazon, I imagine the sale is legit and that the fair quality of the film is due to the technology and equipment available at the time of filming. If you can get past a few little 'pre-tech' annoyances of darkness, misdirected shots, and fuzzy sound, then you're in for a treat! I didn't know James Brown did all of those cool moves. I like the hesitation then bird flaps. I think I'll try that move 'only' at my next dance party. I recommend for true James Brown fans....no matter what! Enjoy! Oh yeah, you do not want to miss the brief altercation with some young fans crashing the stage...LOL"
5,Excellent resource,Excellent gift idea. Book looks great and seemed to be a great edition. Not the easiest to navigate but a must-have for any Catholic.
3,Book Review.,"I think this book was very fairly priced and I've been quite pleased with it. I feel like the seller was VERY honest, which in or world today you don't see much of. So thank you very much!"
2,Caveat Emptor! Incomplete edition,"This Doubleday edition of the Catechism is incomplete - it lacks the Index of Citations and Glossary, and the Subject Index is incomplete. It is dishonest to present this as the second edition."
5,Two thumbs up!!,"Finally I got it on my bookshelf today. It is the first day and I have already finished 100 first pages of the Cathecism. This is to me a perfect reasoning to explain Catholic faith, how the Church interprets the Scripture, put it into the context of the Church's doctrines, and explains it in the most sensible way to everyone: Catholics, non-Catholics, even non-Christians.It is really interesting to see how ""rational"" the Cathecism has presented, especially how the book describe the concept of God and His Trinitarian nature as the foundation of Christian belief. This book is certainly a source of information as well as a strong defence material for Protestant attacks on Catholic doctrines."
5,The Catechism of the Catholic Church,"This is the play book for the catholic church's teachings and religious beliefs. Anyone who is serious about forming an educated opinion of what is going on in the mind of a good catholic or their church, this book will bring tremendous insight into what are they doing and why are they are there."
3,It's ok,"I received the book in great condition! My only complaint is that it too so long to get here (2 weeks). Due to the inflation of gas prices, I'm not that upset about it getting it so late, although, I wish it could have gotten here sooner. I would buy from this company again."
5,The Catechism of the Catholic Church is a statement of the Church's faith and doctrine - John Paul II (Fidei Depositum),"The one book along with the Bible that all Catholics should own. Excellent resource for study. The CCC is also an excellent resource for discussions among the faithful on contentious issues.(ie. War,Death Penalty, etc, etc). One of the attractive features of this edition is its compactness and durability."
5,Excellence and then some,"This Catechism provided many answers for questions I had and some answers to questions I never knew I had. It is truly informative and a solid foundational explanation of the Catholic Church and the beliefs it has been established upon. A great read for all of those who seek and who want to know why their faith is what it is and why they do what they do during mass. It is revealing, inspirational, and able to fill in gaps one may have or may never have known they had. One of the best books I have ever read and one that will never, ever get old."
5,Excellant Condition-Like new,"I was a little leary about purchasing a used book, that it would look like it went through a lot. But instead the book almost looked new. Thanks"
3,Doubleday's Second edition of the CCC,I was disappointed in Doubleday's second edition. It lacks the great index of citations contained in my original Cataechism of the Catholic Church by Liguori Publications.
3,a little small,"I actually just exchanged this item for the larger ""Catechism of the Catholic Church: Revised in Accordance With the Official Latin Text Promulgated by Pope John Paul II (Paperback)"". The reason being is that the format is better. I felt the pocket version was too small and the other one has a glossary and an extensive index."
5,Excellant Resource for Catholics or those curious about the Catholic Faith.,As far as the book goes it is built very durable. I bought this book because I wanted to grow in in knowledge about my faith. It goes over everything and I would recommend this book to those Catholics that want to learn more about their faith. Those who are not Catholic and would like to know what we believe this would be a great book to get as well.
5,"excellent item, true to the last word","This book does an excellent job of explaining Catholic doctrine in a very detailed and simple manner. The Catechism of the Catholic Church also talks about many of the so called ""difficult issues"" (which aren't difficult at all if you took the time to read the bible) and give a detailed explanation about that the right thing is. Excellent read for all Catholics!"
4,Good,"The index is basically useless when looking things up for me. It's set up in a unique way. Make sure you read the note in the beginning of the index. And it will explain it. Other then that. I flip through it and find it riviting. It's great to understand things more in depth as a Catholic, and will certainly help my faith be in a better direction. This is a must have for any Catholic. It's just understanding the index that is the problem. Other then that. great explaination of the commandments, and the prayer our father, and understanding the human condition."
3,Pretty Good Prison Film,This was actually better than I expected it would be. Sutherland's menacing performance as the warden was one of the highlights & the end was a good satisfying revenge.
4,Trout Summer,"Its a good book if you like camping. Its about two kids that find a ranger. Its good ,but the ranger is mean."
5,Great Book,This book is a very good one. It is an experience hopefullyyour children will never have to deal with. Jane Leslie Conly did agreat job writing this book 5 STARS!
1,"Gee,I smell MST3K!!!","Oh dear,I once watched this movie on ""Earth Day"" at my High School once.I wanted to storm out of the room.Yes,""Last Days of Planet Earth"" is THAT bad.Suicide cults,metion of cannibalism(cut from some prints though),LSD fiends,Mutant plant and animals are just too goofy.This movie ranks up with ""Manos:the Hands of Fate"" on the top bad movies of all time."
2,Pretty silly and very mediocure,"Man, quite alot happens in this movie. Motorcycle riders kill themselves; the air becomes so poluted that kids attend school in gas masks. Killer plants, blood sucking slugs, giant leaches (at least not as silly as the ones in Attack of the Giant Leaches), and radiation mutated humans kill people. And eventuly the sky turns into a giant mirror. Banned in Japan because of the radiation mutant sequice."
1,Absolutely Awful,"This movie is virtually unwatchable, makes no sense, and reapeated viewings just might lead to brain damage. Stay away. Do not purchase this movie."
2,Can't recommend this Floppy Drive,I found that while the drive would read the contents of disc #1 it would not run the setup file so I could install the software. I wanted to install some old games on my new computer. I found this to be true on three sets of installation discs. I was able to do the install by copying the first disc to a thumb drive and running the setup file from there. The floppy drive did run the additional discs in each set.
1,Kindle Version not translated by Paul Roche,I purchased this item because it had the picture of the book of the Oedipus plays that were translated by Paul Roche. When I started reading the book it said that it was translated by F. Storr. I am very disappointed because the kindle version did not tell me that the translator was F. Storr. I want my $2.85 back.
2,Oedipus at Colonus,Oedipus at Colonus was a fairly good sequel to Oedipus the King. In this book Oedipus and one of his daughters go to Colonus the Gods sent sickness because he killed his father and then married his mother.This book was a lot easier to read than I was expecting. Usually I have a tough time reading these old kind of plays but this one was written in such a way that I was able to understand it which was a plus. The whole plot is really good; Oedipus's sons are fighting over who gets to be king. If you read any of the previous stories of Oedipus you should know about the oracle. This is a wonderful element to these stories. When you hear the oracle's prediction you know that you should believe it because of what happen in the first story. Recomended for ages 15 and older.
1,THe plot is interesting.,"I thought that it was really weird that he killed his father so he could marry his mother, I didn't think that things like that happened way back then."
4,Good textbook,"I used Reisberg's book as the textbook for my students. I like several aspects of this book: (1) distribution of the content: Reisberg has given each subfield of cognitive psychology a fair share of pages; (2) coherence: a coherent theoretical framework runs through many chapters; (3) proper evaluation of cognitive studies: this textbook makes proper evaluation to merits and drawbacks of different studies cited and does not just list major findings. A significant setback of this textbook is its lack of neuroscience materials. Studies using neuroscience techniques (e.g., fMRI/PET, MEG/ERP, neuropsychology, single-unit recording) have significantly enhanced our understanding of human cognition, yet there is nearly no coverage of these studies. Still, this is perhaps the best textbook available for students of cognitive psychology."
2,"Good introduction, but way too much.","This textbook is a fairly good introduction to cognitive psychology, but is way too dense. By that, I don't mean it talks about stuff too much, but it talks too much in general. Depth is good, but without illustrations, the text and meaning doesn't come up. All 500 pages of this book are primarily text, and thus it is boring. And when you consider each chapter is 40 pages long, no illustrations, or at least very little pictures and diagrams, doesn't really help you gain an interest in the ideas the textbook tries to present to you."
2,Swisher 44 in. 12.5 HP Rough Cut Trailcutter,Be prepared to reinforce the arm and movable towing parts. Swishers view of the terrain is more in line with how a finish mower should perform. Once you spend an additional est 300 dollars to reinforce the towing assembly be very careful with the manual extension cord use to engage the mower blades. This repeatedly comes loose and must be checked frequently. Replacing the belt is not an easy task either. Once you make the modifications still use caution. The towing are is this products weakest link.
5,A wonderful and high quality CD at a bargain price!,"This is one of my favorite collections from NAXOS. The 1812 Overture, conducted by Adrian Leaper, is exciting and dynamic! Many of my favorite pieces are featured here: the Waltz from Sleeping Beauty, the Waltz from Serenade for Strings, Andante Cantabile (Symphony #5), June (Seasons), and many others. The musicianship of the artists and the sound quality are excellent. High quality CDs need not be expensive. I bet you'll enjoy this CD as much as I did!"
4,"Interesting book, but stretches stories unneccessarily","This is not a book without merit; it simply is a book that strectches out storylines that could have been wrapped up in one book. Toby Holt stills has to quell the northern tier from Ma Hastings and Red Cloud, such as he had to in Montana. Meanwhile, Beth Blake undergoes captivity and a homicide trial that has little in the means of suspense.Still, I like the story dealing with Toby's and Gentle Doe's affair, and the introduction of Kale Salton continues the Ross tradition of having ""ladies of ill repute"" seens as angels trapped in a bad guy's profession. I give this book a generous 4 stars."
3,left wanting ....,that's the problem with Naxos .... real average !!!for much better work at the same low price ... get DG !!!
3,Review,"Not Bad, but the film quality leaves a lot to be desired. Strictly for the fanatic and a bit too expensive for the length and or the content."
1,NOT WHAT YOU GET,THE PICTURE OF THIS SKATE IS NOT WHAT YOU GET I ORDERED FOR MY SON AND THE LOGO ON THE HEEL IS NOT ON IT AND THE WHEELS HAVE LIKE SPOLK HOLES ALL AROUND THEM AND WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE SKATES THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS AND THE WHEELS ON THESE SKATES WERE USED VERY DISAPPOINTED
3,Great Skates for the price,The skates seem to be great quality for today's standards.The only issues I see are the wheels and bearings. I believe you can buy the same wheels for $8.00 total to replace. I am upgrading to different bearings since I do not think they are truly precision bearings. As far as the rest of the skate seems to be high quality which should last for many years without the thought of wearing them out. Our local skating rink wanted $86 so truly this is a bargain.
3,Ok...but not the best...,"When I received my skates I was disappointed on a few levels. One, as soon as I took my skates to the rink I realized the wheels that came with the skates were meant moreso for outside skating, NOT indoor rink skating [even though they're labeled as ""rink"" skates]. Once I replaced the wheels with better wheels I noticed an IMMEDIATE enhancement in the way my skates rolled on the floor. Two, the stopper of the skate scuffed the floor of the rink floor when I used it to stop/brake. I wish the stopper wasn't so cheaply made. At this rate it will be a nub in another year or so if I go skating every week. I'm going to be putting more money into my skates to make them better than I initially paid for the skates themselves. These skates are a decent start for a beginner pair..."
4,sweet ride,I really enjoy my skates.... it was truly worth the price....thx....ps let future customers know they do run big in size....i wear a 12 but had to get an 11 ....
2,Uncomfortable Ankle Support,"As the title suggests, these skates are very uncomfortable around the ankle. Even with the addition of multiple pairs of socks it there just is not a good fit. In addition, the skate is a lot heavier than your standard pair. Let's just say I'm searching for another pair if you're thinking about purchasing these bad boys."
3,fine,"London ballet dancer mutually falls in love at 1st sight with forester, quickly marries him & quits ballet to move to his rural town, where she realizes how different her life is now. When she gets pregnant, her r/s with hero turns a different direction.It was a good enough read. Like other Lamb books, this one got my emotions involved. Writing, dialogue, & characters were fine. Sexual chemisty was good. Love scenes were not detailed. It was a realistic love-at-first-sight romance, depicting the challenges a couple faces when they start living together day in & day out. The Big Misunderstanding, though, seemed contrived. It seemed like it was added to make the story more dramatic. It wasn't that much of a bother but made the book more typical.Recommended as an average read."
4,Simple and surprising sturdy,"Simple and sturdy construction. My 17"" Macbook Pro doesn't slip or slide. It's not amazing to look at but its completely hidden beneath the lap top. Packs away easily and the swivel function is very useful. I'm very happy with the stand."
4,good product,"Good product, well built, makes it easier to use a laptop since it angles the keyboard. Also keeps the laptop cooler, works with a 15"" Macbook. Seems a bit expensive though."
2,does the job i guess,"The hooks over the door are just a little too thick for my door to shut completely. We are going to cut the tabs off the top and screw it into the door. Also, I purchased a new iron and after researching online, if you use a steam function iron, you should always store the iron vertically - this hanger holds the iron by the handle which is horizontal. If it wasn't such a pain, I'd return it."
2,Clumsy...,"I probably should have returned this item... the hooks that 'catch' the ironing board are really made for legs that go straight across vs the 'V'. The legs of my board barely catch. Also, there's not enough space between the bottom and where the iron is held. Very clumsy design.."
4,Her writing defines America,"Okay, so my headline is corny and ultimately misleading. We were once a nation of regions and, to some extent, we still are. Followers of folk music are always looking for the next Dylan. While it is true, there is only one Dylan (for that matter, one Bruce Springsteen and, if you are English, one Richard Thompson) but Kate has the potential for becoming the greatest woman songwriter in America. Her songs and voice are Southern -- one of the most highly defined regions in America. She knows this country and the events that shaped it. No where is that knowledge more brilliantly displayed than in Galaxie 500 or in Delmos Jackson. The former ties a popular automobile model with change and with the assisination of Dr. King. The latter, a more challenging song, purposely marries mundane, everyday sounds -- a deceptively simple melody and lyric -- with a salute to an everyday hero, the janitor of the title."
5,Great family storytime book!,"My grandmother would read this to us when we would come over to her house, and it was always a instant favorite. Guaranteed to bring smiles to everyone!"
4,Great but Better Retitled,"Though the two-parter on this tape, 'Shadow of the Bat' is a fantastic story, it would have been better released as the Batgirl video. The episodes do not explain Two-Face's origins but show how and why the Batgirl came about. Watch it. Decide for yourself."
2,melted/stale,I have ordered the bars before and really enjoyed them. this recent order came to me - both boxes like they had melted and tasted stale. I called the company and they said they have a disclaimer regarding the possibility of melting but no way could they be stale. Well I got news for them they do not taste fresh but rather like they have been around for sometime- so since they wouldn't even consider exchanging I will never order from them again. I can deal with the chocolate issue but not the staleness.
5,Cat Christmas,"Was the funniest and oh, so true holiday card I've seen this season. Since I purchase at least five different sets a year and almost all are animal/cat themes, this one had to be in the group."
5,"Route 66, the Mother Road - and the Video to match!","Kirk's video treatment of Route 66 and its Illinois landmarks and personalities parallels what this historic highway was really all about, and about the people responsible for its many past claims to fame. His homespun easy going style confirms his deep love of this famous road that once connected Chicago and Los Angeles - a love and respect bound to be felt by all who see it. Well produced, narrated and choreographed the program is a ""must"" for any video library. And if you happen to be into cross country motorcycling, the appeal is an added bonus. Far more than just a ""travelogue"" the video is an experience long to be remembered. I look forward to his treatments of the remaining states once served by ROUTE 66."
1,good looks bad quality,"I bought a blue one.The mug looks nice enough, but it cracked the first time I filled it with hot water for tea.Get your act together guys -- it really is not so difficult to make dishes that can withstanda little heat. As for the claim that this can go in the microwave...after the mug cracked, Ididn't bother to try."
2,Hungarian Rhapsody Number 2 - awfully orchestrated,"Liszt, as one may well know, wrote some extremely beautiful music. Therefore, any bad review which I give must be due to the performance of his work. Hungarian Rhapsody no 2 is one of the most beautiful pieces of music in existance. It is originally a piano piece, but the piece on this CD has been orchestrated - with an absolutely disastrous effect. One not only does one not get the wonderful strong rhythm that the hungarian rhapsody should provide, but the choice of instruments of whoever orchestrated this piece actually makes this work sound bad. The other tracks on this CD are played well enough, but if you are looking for the best of Liszt, you will not be satisfied as Hungarian R. no. 2 is a monumental work of Liszt."
1,"No Code Included With Purchse Of ""New"" Text From Amazon","Potential Buyers,If you are a student who is taking an accounting course and your instructor requires you to use the accompanying Wiley Plus website, do not expect to get a Wiley Plus, registration code with this product.I purchased the text ""new"" directly from Amazon for an accounting class I am taking and I assumed that I would recieve the registration code I needed; I assumed wrong as there was no registration code included with my book.If you do need the code for class and you do choose to buy this book from Amazon, you'll be best off buying the cheapest, used edition and going to the Wiley Plus site directly to get a standard registration code for around $60 dollars. Of Course keep in mind shipping costs may eat up any savings you'd get buying from Amazon in the first place!The 1 star review actually reflects my dissatisfaction with the description of this product on Amazon's site, and not the quality of the text.Happy Shopping!"
2,Why make a busy topic busier?,"We used this book in my accounting class. The coverage jumped around a too much for my taste. Also, not having an accounting background, the constant language changes (with no cross references and very superficial glossary), especially between the chapter text and the exercises made the endeavor excruciating. The worst part was not being able to check answers. The answer key should come with the book. Not having an answer key invalidates this books use as a learning tool even if it were better written."
1,This Book is Terrible!,"This book is terrible! It gives different definitions for the same term several times in the first few chapters. Why doesn't it just give one coherent, comprehensive definition for each word?!! The concepts are broken up and presented helter-skelter, so reading this book is like working a tedious jigsaw puzzle. Then it includes lots of problems at the end of each chapter, but there is no answer key, and the Solutions Manual is only available to teachers. Do they think that my professor is too lazy or too stupid to make up his own tests? (Hint to oblivious writers/editors: a textbook is useless if students cannot practice working problems and check the answers on their own. This is not third grade, and my professor is not a babysitter!) I bought the workbook (which contains practice tests) separately, but I still don't have the answers to the problems at the end of the chapters. I will speak to the department heads at my college and beg them to switch publishers next semester."
2,Terrible,"This was a required text for my accounting class. Let's just say, if you're not familiar with accounting, or not fond of it, this text will make you hate it even more! Be careful because I somehow received the loose leaf edition of it and had to place it in my own binder..."
3,Beginner's Accounting Book,"The book covers the basics of what you need to know for financial accounting. Most of the concepts in this book will carry over to later accounting classes. I still have it as a reference just in case I forget some things. However, the read is extremely boring and it costs way too much."
2,Prepare to be bored to death,"Well I'm sure I don't have to tell you how completely boring accounting is going to be so prepare yourself. This book is not written barney style. It's super confusing and the accounting jargon is a little hard to understand. The exercises in the book are pretty hard core but they're possible. All I'm saying is prepare yourself for boring chapters, boring exercises and boring lectures. Thankfully I'll be done this course in two weeks, but I still have to take managerial accounting. :("
2,disappointed,"book was not described correctly in ad.shipping time was acceptable, book received different cover, should have not been posted under original post."
4,Good Seller!,"I was really happy with this seller because she sent me the book right away. Not to mention that it's nice to get what you expect. She promised a used-like new edition, and I got what I asked for. I would defeneitly recomment this seller to anyone."
1,Highway robbery,"This book and the service surrounding it is absolute garbage. The positive reviews it has received are highly dubious. The book is very unclear with terminology, and the lack of answer keys to check your progress makes this worse. If you're buying this used be prepared to wade through red tape to get access to an answer key. 70 bucks for a single semester of access, and you won't have access as soon as you pay, you will also need a url from your instructor to access the site. I understand why this is needed for your class specific information but to simply access the sites tools, like an answer sheet, should not require anything more than your subscription...actually it should have come with the book.I have taken two other classes with website support material and I did not have to go through near the trouble. I am likely to take my complaint to my colleges administration as this book would only be tolerable to someone strong in this field, which defeats its purpose."
2,Total Rip-off,"The book is good, but $130 dollars!!!! You still need to buy a 3 ring binder to put the sheets in, it's not even a paperback, meaning the publisher didn't even spend the money for binding. Who owns this company, Shell? Exxon? Enron?!? There are other accounting books for a fraction of the cost, but the organized crime (my community college) requires this particular one. I wonder what their incentive might be???"
1,Used really means used and in this case bad!,"The book arrived on time just like it said on the order form, but the condition of the book was horrible. If I'm not mistaken the book was advertised as used but in good or excellent condition. The corners of the book are rubbed or scuffed off showing the gray cardboard underneath, and the pages are soaked from water damage from pages 1-144. I'll never order from them again."
5,Terrific,The book is in great condition. I ordered on a Tuesday and it arrived the following Tuesday. I saved significantly over the college bookstore.
4,"Good quality book, long wait to receive it","It took like 3-4 weeks for this book to ship. There was no communication whatsoever and I was ready to cancel my order. Then all of a sudden the book arrives (in great shape) with a note apologizing that they were on vacation. That is fine but I just wish that would have been communicated up front when I placed the order. However, I am not going to bash mother and daughter's books because it was in great shape and the price was very good. Just a little stressful for a couple weeks."
2,Used book advertised as New,"The book I recieved was adverstised as ""New"" but actually wasn't. There was a couple of pages with things written on them. The book also was a little weathered. It was clear the book was ""Used""."
1,I NEVER RECEIVED MY BOOK!!!,"I ordered this book well before the start of the semester. I realized that I may not get it right away, I also realized that I may have had to go a week or so in the class without it. But I never thought I would have to withdraw from the class because I NEVER received my book and in turn also lost a couple hundred dollars!!! I'm hoping for a refund, or store credit, for the book and the stress of not having it.Thank you"
5,simple and easy understanding,the book provides examples and graphs to help demonstrate the text.it has a lot of details and online reviews if u want to learn more and deeper
4,Clear & Concise,"This book is required of my Financial Accounting course and it is a great choice. The book displays many colorful illustrations and is pretty clear in the messages that it attempts to explain. This book will definitely help you to get an A in your class...or at least pass! The only flaw that I see is that it does not give many answers to the exercises and problems in the chapters. Otherwise, it is pretty good."
5,This isn't Hornblower,"After viewing A&E's Hornblower series, I began devouring books on the Napoleonic wars. After the Hornblower books, the Aubrey/Maturin series and finally the Ramage series, Needles characters are a breath of fresh air. Not to take anything away from the previous authors, I feel Needles gritty realism is something sorely missing in the genre (especially in the Lord Ramage series). I look forward to see the development of Midshipman Bentley for the very reason that he is so flawed. Lets hope that someday Bentley becomes a fine and noble officer, but not too soon. I have just ordered #2 in the series and can't wait to see where young Mr.Bentley ends up next. Keep up the good work Mr.Needles!"
1,"Too brutal, nasty","This is not a nice book, its really sadistic. We dont know if this kind of stuff really went on back then, but if it did, its realistic history.But this book, just read by my husband, is not going into our library where our grandkids can find it. They have enough violence in their lives just from watching the news, videos of car accidents, and playing their creepy video games.So this book is going into our chiminea. Good thing to get the fire going."
2,Not Your Hornblower type hero,"So the characters you are drawn too are not those who transition to lead our series here. There is no heroism. There is atrocity. There is great characterization, but this is not what we have come to expect in the genre.Then if you are looking for something that gives you a sense of victory and uplifts you at the end of the story, it does not come. Our protaganoists whom we are left with our anti-heroes.There is no feeling that their survivial is something worth investing three to four hours to read this tale."
1,A Bummer....,"I bought the slippers for my boyfriend and was very disappointed to find they are NOT ""one size fits all""...if your man is a shoe size 10 1/2 or more these slippers will not fit."
3,slippers,first pair lasted 1 year started to squeak very loudly 2nd pair i bought new the right slipper motor was so loud i could'nt hear so i returned them and so far the new pair are ok however they are not one size fits alli have to stuff my feet in them and my heel still sticks out over the back and i only wear a 10 1/2 shoe so i wish they would make a larger sizebut all in all they do make my feet feel better after being on my feet all day would have to think about buying another pair but can't find any other similar
3,One Size Fits All??,"These slippers are worth exactly what you pay for them here.They are relatively comfortable and the ""massaging"" beads are neither annoying nor very effective. However, I am only an 11 1/2 shoe size and these things BARELY fit. I have to jam my toes pretty far into them so that my heel doesn't stick out."
3,Good,Dated but good My husband never saw it when it first came out. and the VHS quality was not too great
4,Great book for children,"The series of the Unfortunate Events books are exceptional books for children, especially ages 10-15. The Miserable Mill is a continuation of Snicket's brilliant series of the unluckyBaudlaire children. It begins warning you to not read this book if you are in search of a pleasant book to read with a happy ending, and believe me, you should take its word! TheBaudlaire children are headed on their way to one of their many guardians house, and encounter on many disastrous adventures while working at the Lucky Smells Lumber Mill.Read this book if you are not interested in a serious reading!"
3,"Okay, but repetitive","Lemony Snicket's first book, ""A Bad Beginning,"" was a fun book and made me want to read more. However, four books later into the series, the storyline became extremely repetitive and predictable, and I found myself concentrating more on what the Baudelaires could have done if they had more common sense to save themselves and I spent less time enjoying the book. The plots have all been the same, and the books end up just being depressing."
5,Different from the first 3 books.,"In the first 3 books, the Baudelaires had a guardian,lived with them,Count Olaf kills them and they get a new one.Their Guardian this time is a business man whose face is covered in smoke. The orphans have to work at his mill.While living there, Klaus breaks his glasses and goes to an eye place and when he comes back from the eye place,he's been hypnotized. Count Olaf doesn't make a direct approach to the orphans, he lets them come to him.the good news is that their guardian doesn't die, but they can't stay at that mill, its terrible.If you thought that the 2nd and 3rd books were repetitive,then you'll be happy with this one."
4,This is a very good book!,I like this book alot. It has very good description. At first when I started the book I thought I was not going to like it.Then when I got into the book I really started to like it! I love the awesome words he uses! He makes it where you can see what is going on. My favorite part is when the kids go with Klaus because he got tripped and his glasses broke so he had to go back to the eye doctor and Violet and Sunny go with him and they find out who Count Olaf is acting like. I like this book a lot and I am sure you will to.
5,Best Book in Series,"The Miserable Mill is the best book in the series so far. I have read the whole series except for the newest book, The Penultimate Peril. For people who love these books I would like to tell you something that you might already know.....Book the Thirteenth is going to be the last book in the series. When the series is over and you find yourself stuck with nothing to read, I suggest that you read The Thief Lord by Corneilia Funke. It is very good and is about more orphans! When you finish that you should read Inkheart by Corneilia Funke. They are all very good books!!!"
5,lemoney snicket,these are one of my favorite series lsmony snicket is the best. at my scool i read all the books they had they only had a few though.
3,Not one of the best,"As readers of this series will undoubtedly agree, Lemony Snicket makes a very entertaining author. The characters in these stories are unique and fun, however this individual story failed to stand out from the rest. It's plot was ok, and it had it's moments, but it didn't make itself memorable. Although it didn't stand out, it still is a must if one is reading this series."
2,Very sad!,"I just could not get into reading this book. Very sad and negative. I read it with my 11 year old granddaughter, which I would not recommend."
5,A Series of Unfourtunate Events #4,"I've read the whole series. This is by far my favorite. I wished the series could go on after the last one.P.S. I recommend The Mysterious Benedict Society, if you like Lemony Snicket, it is even better."
3,"Most entertaining, less strict word usage","This episode of the series has the most entertaining plot so far, however, I am beginning to tire of Snicket's defining of words within the story. Where at the beginning of the series, he appeared to be giving near-dictionary definitions, his adherence to this has deteriorated to where he is using the events of the book to define the word. For example: ...the words ""grotesque"" and ""unnerving"" here mean ""twisted, tangled, stained and gory."" Which they do not, always."
4,By a seventh grader,"I think the book was an exiting,suspensful book.It was so exiting , once you read the first chapter, you dont want to put it down. It's a mystery book, and every chapter has exiting, suspensful,and mysterious events."
2,Boring and not expectant,Oh my gosh this is the worst Series Of Unforunate Events Book I have ever read. it was boring unlike the other books it was very bad the others i loved though
2,Losing steam,"The fourth book in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, THE MISERABLE MILL, begins just like the previous three: with an introduction abounding with wit and humor rarely seen in most children's literature today. Indeed, the witty narrative and humor are (for the most part) just as plentiful in this book as in the previous three.But in terms of plot and characters, Lemony seems to be running out of steam. The plot twists and happenings in the previous books were always far-fetched but still believable to some degree or another. However, in this book they are simply far-fetched. Also, Count Olaf (this time in drag) came across as far less menacing than in the three previous books.I will soon be reading the fifth book and expect it to far exceed the quality of this one. I realize that with thirteen books in a series, there's going to be a bad apple or two."
3,And more,"As the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans continues, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are sent to live and work at a lumber mill. Almost too late, the children uncover Count Olaf's evil plan and associate's disguises. The only thing that can save them is if Violet is able to take over her brother's role as the voracious reader, and if Klaus can take over his sister's role as an inventor.There isn't nearly as much new vocabulary in this story. Instead, as the children problem solve, there is much attention paid to how to navigate a nonfiction book (how to use the features of the text, such as the table of contents, to find information) and what to do when you come to a word you don't know. The author uses several illustrations of Violet coming to unknown words in a text, skipping over them, and using the context clues to make sense of the selection."
1,Yt? hal,Run on the second half a million dollars to the kindle is an important part in the second half a screenshot on the second half and dumb enough of unfortunate that the kindle and a screenshot advertisements for t
4,Great book,I love all the Lemony Snicket books. He is a great author. The Baudelaire orphans have a miserable life indeed.
3,Most depressing book of the series,"Hmmm..... this book was unfortunately less enjoyable to me than any other book in the series. I found it to be depressing and full of sawdust, however the character persona of Shirley made me cackle like a hyena."
3,The Miserable Mill on audio book,This is a good story. My kids love the orphans. We have been listening to the audio books and have enjoyed hearing Tim Curry read the first two books. The Miserable Mill was read by the author instead of Tim Curry and we enjoyed listening to Tim Curry more. Bring back Tim Curry for all future books! One of these audio books in the car promises a quiet ride.
4,READ ME!!!,"Not as good as the rest, but still hilarious! If you ever wanted to see, or read about, Count Olaf in a dress, hypnotized children, lumber mill workers that get paid in coupons, or evil eye doctors, then this is the book for you! LEMONY SNICKET IS AT IT AGAIN!"
4,OK,I my self am this series maniak. Altough the book plays & fullfills the requirements of the series it doesn't cut it. The other books in the series are better. What the book lacks is a large chunk of problems. The only big Baudelaire prob. is the hipnocious DR.ORVILE because of her hipnotizing skills. The book is ok not extraordinary like the others.
4,Must Be Snicket,"We all know that Lemony Snicket's books are so unfortuanate its hard to bear through it but this one is probably just another time passer to just make the Baudelaires a little more miserable, LIKE ITS POSIBLE! I like the books alot but I didn't enjoy this one."
3,"Good, but could be better","I think that Snickett has great talent,however I find this his worst book. There are a few scenes which I find unimaginable, and the characters do not seem to learn anything or change during the course of this book."
4,The Miserable Mill,"This was an excellent book. I would give it 5 stars, but It fell short of some things I had expected it to have. The plot was brillant. Sir was a most mysterous character."
5,OUTSTANDING !!,"""Outstanding"" is a term which, when used here means ""really, good, great, entertaining - and more than initially meets the eye."" Be sure to read the dedications - and as the volumes continue: what, if anything, did Cout Olaf have to do with Beatrice? Why is the writer ""compelled"" to write this tale? I am sure the answers to these questons will be revealed as the saga continues... For me, money very well-spent for an entertaining, well-written, totally-original two hour read.Those of you who have read the books will understand the structure of my first sentence."
4,Couldn't put this down!!!,"Max McCaffertyThis book is for peoplethat like horrible thingsthat happen to childrenand very narrow escapees.ages 8 thru 12.This book is the story of the three Baudelaire orphans when they get sent to there sixth guardian and they start working in his lumber mill even to there many protests. The triplets hate it there! They get gum for lunch,they have to scrape bark off trees all day long and the forman (forman Facoolno) push them around like a bully. And the forman keeps on tripping Kiaus and every time he comes out like a zombie...."
3,Really three and a half.,"This book took a pretty long time for me to get into,and is probally my least fav. one out of this great series.Even though it is not horrible,it still isn`t as good as the three before this one!"
1,under-aged workers at a lumber mill,"If one wants a book thats full of action,adventure,thrills,and misery then one should get the book the miserebele mill by Lemony snicket. The story bigins with three children named Vilot, Klase, and Sunny their parents died in a horrible fire in the begining of the series. Misfortune seemes to follow them everywhere they go. They have an evil relitive named Count Olaf who is after their fortune. In the biggining of the story they are on this train going to this city named Paltyvill with a banker named Mr. Poe, who is in charge the orphans bank affairs and keeping Count Olaf away. When they got there their gardian is making them work in a lumber mill for 3 years to keep count olaf and his thugs away so its kinda unfair but when vilot comes of age I highly recommend this book I really like it."
2,The Tedious Book,"I thought that this book was really boring. In the first chapter all he did was describe the Baudelaires. Then in the next few chapters it wasn't very exciting. I expected some thing exciting to pop up in about the third chapter, but nothing happened.Then finally at the end there was something that was kind of exciting. I thought it was really weird that for lunch and dinner they had to chew gum. That doesn't even make any sense. Also that they tried to hypnotize Klaus. The part that I thought was funny was that Count Olaf had to dress up like a woman. I can't even imagine what he would look like because I bet it would be too much of an ugly site to see. I rated it a two and not a one because Count Olaf's disguise was really goo and that there was about one or two exciting and mysterious parts in it. That is all I have to say about this boring book. I would definately not read this book because it is really boring. If I gave this book a letter grade it would be a D-.P.H."
1,This doesn't deserve a star.,"Unlike the other books in the series, this book is AWFUL! I am telling ya! It is the worst in the series. If you are reading the series 1 through 9, you should entirly skip this book. It is so terible. Now the best in the series is the 2nd, so read that one instead of this one.It is about the miserable orphans, and they have to work on this mill, then the young boy, (Klaus), gets hypnotized. His sisters don't know how to research, but they figure it out.Don't even pick this book up in the first place."
1,TOO CUTE FOR WORDS,I really disliked this book intensely and find it hard to believe that any but the most sophisticated child would ever pick it up or read it on his or her own. This is an adult book for adults.
3,OK but Skimpy,"Good reference ""pamphlet"" but a little short on number of pages and ideas. More like a pamphlet than a reference book. Not so sure it was worth $10 but that is Wilson for you! Paying mostly for the name and not for the value of information."
2,Disappointed,"I have to say that I was expecting something more from this book . . . . more like a ""how to"" than a ""see what you can do"". It is still a helpful reference for aspiring cake decorators, but I'm still lost as to how to make the beautiful designs with the specific tips."
3,Could Have Been Better,I was disappointed with this book. Was hoping for more information and pictures on how to use the tips. Not certain if I would recommend this book.
5,L'encre t'eyeux,We purchased it for one song and my mom loves the rest of the music as well so it was a worthwhile investment in her joy! Great buy for the francophile in your life!
4,Time travel romance,"A time travel romance. The lead character is female and she travels from the distant future back to old England to solve a mystery. Naturally she meets up with our hero and falls in love but fears she will leave him once her mission is accomplished. A very good story and one that was easy to follow. No heavy sexy scenes, just two characters of that time period falling for each other. There was adventure but not too much. A fun easy read."
4,It's not your standard time travel,"I'll admit, I'm a Lynn Kirkland addict and was expecting something along the same lines. So different and quite entertaining. I don't want to spoil the plot, but there's a time traveling machine, anchors who help manage the time travelers and some very entertaining characters, unexpected twists in the story and a surprise ending. It's fun, a little different and more interesting than your average novel. Have fun."
3,different,It was different to read a book about space travel more or less. I did read it to the end. I envy the writers who can write a book and keep you interested.
4,helps keep laptop cool,"I wanted to get a little stand/pad for my laptop, and the only ones I could find in stores were huge or overly complicated. I didn't want extra USB ports or fans or for my laptop to be elevated 3 inches. Finally found this one on Amazon, and it gets the job done just right. It props up the back of the laptop about 0.5 - 1.0 inch."
3,"Doesn't work with ""any laptop""","Basically, i ordered this product becuase i wanted to extend the life of my laptop by allowing airflow. I measured my laptop to see if they were relatively the same size and it looked like it would work, but as the description claims this product does NOT work with any laptop, it ONLY works with the three listed above and no other. It made my laptop, which is in similar size to the macbook, wobbly and unstable, i felt more comfortable leaving it safely on the desk. Only purchase this product if you have a macbook, it wont work for any other similarly sized laptop."
4,Charming Read,"Baldacci does a great job when he concentrates on writing mystery/suspense novels and The Collectors is no exception. David nails this one with a cast of characters that are not the run of the mill ""perfect spies"" that so many authors fall back on. Instead we get an unlikely team of 4 older men and a new delectable con artist who will outwit the bad guys in ways you can't imagine.I liked watching the pieces coming together as I read this book, wondering how Baldacci was going to weave it into a seamless story and he did. His characters have history, depth, soul, intellect, and spirit without being cloyingly perfect.The ending sets us up for the next novel to take right off with his new character, Annabelle, and perhaps the conclusion of her con. The storyline is fresh and interesting and seems very reasonable.Bravo David. Can't wait for the next novel. This was worth the wait!"
3,.disappointed,"I have always enjoyed David Baldacci' books. The Camel Club was different but his new one reminds me of the 1940's. There was an author by the name of Enid Blyton who wrote mystery stories for youngsters. There was 'Five go adventuring again' and other Five adventures. Unfortunately 'The Collectors' reminded me of these exciting stories for 11 year olds. What happened Mr. Balducci? Where are your good, well written old ones?."
2,Terrible,This book does approach Baldacci's usual standard. The story is both predictable and far from believable. Save yourself some money... reread the Dan Brown or Clancy sitting on your shelf. The best thing I can say is that I was able to get through it.
3,Not Up To Baldacci's Normal Standards,"David Baldacci is an author who usually writes a great thriller. This book is an exception to that.This story is a sequel to 'The Camel Club'. As with the previous book, 'The Collectors' features an elderly group of oddballs who outsmart and out investigate the FBI, the D.C. Police, and everyone else. Although that sort of plot may work at times, it doesn't here. There are just too many implausible situations that make this story too farfetched.With another author, this book might be considered pretty good as it does keep moving even though it is a huge stretch at times. As Baldacci started his writing career so strong (Absolute Power, Total Control), it is a disappointment. It is kind of like Tom Clancy going from his numerous brilliant novels to the Op Center series.If you are a fan of Baldacci's earlier works (excluding Wish You Well and The Camel Club), I would not recommend this one. It will be a let down."
5,Amazing,Omg what an amazing book!!! One of the better david balsamic books!!!! This is a must read for david balsamic fans
3,Camel Club saves the day,"this is my 2nd of the series, and I have not read them in order which I don't think matters but I hope to start. The pattern is a handful of characters and how they all tie together with the camel club. I enjoy the personalities of our main guys, they are fun and likeable. Parts of this read is somewhat far fetched but I guess that is what makes it entertaining. I have to admit that there were some parts that I my little ol heart was beating fast and I was reading twice as fast."
3,A Bit of a Thin Plot,Unfortunately this book is not Baldacci's best effort. The plot is not terribly well supported and is unbelievable.Yawn.
5,Th Collectors by David Baldacci,"I enjoyed this book, it's part of a series. Oliver Stone is a great hero."
5,An absolute MUST READ,"I loved this book. Read it in 2 days. It picks up right where ""The Camel Club"" left off. The characters are entertaining and the author aptly pulls you right into the storyline. The ending obviously leads to the opening of the next book, which I anxiously await. I really enjoyed this book, and hope many others take a chance on this one."
1,save your pennies,"There was a time when Baldacchi could be considered a fair writer, but judging from this turkey, he stayed too long at the fair. The characters, presumably intended to be ""cute,"" are merely grating; the plots - two of them - don't come together, and the cliff hanger ending did nothing to make me want to buy another installment.There are lots of good books out there, more deserving of your hard earned money."
2,Science Ignorance Spoils Good Story,"Pretty good story with some credibility problems It is, for me, severely compromised by the appalling scientific ignorance of the writer and editor. The murder weapon is carbon dioxide, 5000 parts per million, which would a)be entirely non-toxic, b)be incapable of suffocation, and c)would not create dry ice snow when expanded. Unfortunately, this silliness plays a central role in the book. Nothing beyond grade school science class should be required to avoid this mistake. There are also frequent grammatical and word usage errors, another editorial problem."
2,"Decent, but didn't finish","This was an engaging book at times. The two plots were a little frustrating, but came together. It seemed like they would fully join in on an explosive ending. However, it left me with an empty feeling that I can only fix by reading another long winded book."
1,Amateurish narrative and on-the-nose dialogue.,"This is the first Baldacci novel I've read, and I have to say I was surprised by the ham-handed narrative and dialogue. Every plot twist had to be immediately (and sometimes repeatedly) summarized and explained as if readers are incapable of making intelligent inferences. It was more like having someone retell a novel than reading it yourself. The plot was not as tight as I would expect from a NYT best selling author, but good execution can compensate for a pedestrian plot. This book lacked in both areas."
3,not bad,"This book was ok. The plot was decent and the characters well developed enough to enjoy. However, I really had a problem with the ending..it was rushed and not very satisfying. I can understand the author wanting to leave some of the plot on a cliffhanger so as to make his audience interested in the next novel, but I think it could have been ended better than it does. Other than that, I would characterize this book as a decent summer read."
3,one more time,"same characters, different crime - I throughly enjoyed the first one and thought revisiting the same wonderful characters again just as enjoyable - a good read worth picking up."
3,Not as good as his first books,"It is strange that all my favorite authors seem to go the same way; their first book is fantastic, the second one is great, the third pretty good and it keeps going down. Why is that, I wonder. You would think that experience improves the writing, but apparently not!"
2,Don't reward this author for leaving the reader hanging.,"In this book Baldacci introduces two stories. While both stories are ""OK"", the second one; (actually the better one) is not concluded. The reader is left hanging and ostensibly forced to buy what will likely be his next book in order to finish this first book.I bought this book expecting to read a complete story. What I got was 1.5 stories neither of which are great or up to Balcacci's norm. I won't be buying another one of his books, however incomplete, in the near future."
3,Good enough to read.,Typical Baldacci.16 more words required;12 more words required;8 more words required;4 more words required.I'm done.
5,Review,I love it.I have it in hardback but wanted a second copy to read when at our beach home.Good read and Baldacci is as good as ever.
2,Waste of time to read,"If it wasn't for the plot, I'd rate this 1 star. The writing is elementary at best and the style is very generic. Many lines and descriptions are very cheesy and a little bigoted at times."
3,Pretty Good,This is better than The Winner. Lots of things going on. Baldacci does a good job with edgy scenes but he's very much plotting his stories from a fill in the blank story line. Doesn't mean you won't be entertained but not the one book you should read if you only read one or 2 books a year.
2,Unfairly left hanging,"Prior to reading this book, I didn't know that it was a sequel of a sort. It was fine as a stand alone book, but at the end he leaves the story line that comprised half the book unfinished. Apparently, it's so you will buy the next book. I'm not really a fan of this type of thing. If you are going to do that, then put something on the front like ""number two in a series of six"". I have a limited budget for books and when I get a book I expect it to have and ending, good or bad. I will hesitate before buying any of Baldacci's books in the future."
2,Not Again?,"Once upon a time David Baldacci spent the time to write a couple of pretty entertaing novels. His most recent work, however, has become progressively worse with ""The Collectors"" really starting to hit the bottom. On the positive side, the story is interesting and we have some good characters. The problem is the quality of the writing. I have to believe he doesn't believe in editors or if he does, he doesn't allow them to do their jobs. ""The Collectors"" reads much more like a weak first of second novel than it does a veteran author who has proven to have a talent to entertain. Disappointing."
5,The Collectors,Thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to the continuation of the characters in his next book!
2,Incomplete,"""The Collectors"" has two story lines - spies and con artists. The action is fast and gripping, but Baldacci only wraps up the spy story. The con artist story, which takes up half the book, is just a setup for some future book. Whatever that book is, I'm off Baldacci; I refuse to take out a Baldacci subscription to see how his plots end."
2,The Collectors,"I don't watch soap operas,I don't watch episodes marked ""first of two parts"", and I hate end-of-season cliff-hangers. I want to see, or read, or listen to a complete story and then move on to something else. I don't like to have an ending held hostage.I was enjoying this book on CD as a way to be entertained while driving, but was really annoyed to find it a cliff-hanger. I'll just assume that things turn out alright, but will avoid this author in the future. Books that play this trick on a reader at the end need to have a disclaimer on the cover."
3,Good but not great,"This is a very entertaining read. However, I found that there are two distinctly different stories within the book. Baldacci hastily tried to link the two with a single female character. There is really no clear reason for the two to be together. Each story on its own would be good, and I can think of a lot of ways to better link the two stories.Overall, I enjoyed the read as long as I didn't spend much time trying to understand the reasoning for the plots."
3,Annabelle is a Star,"Baldacci tells a wonderful story and he introduces some memorable characters. In this book we meet Annabelle Conroy who is memorable even if not believable. On the other hand he leaves the development of the characters in the Camel Club. They were interesting in the first book because we met them. In this book there is no effort to develop the individual characters.I enjoyed the two separate stories that do come together. The rapport between Oliver and Annabelle was good.On the negative side, even though I realize that thrillers are not supposed to be completely true this was a little far fetched. Also it did not have the quality of past efforts.I also must comment that I do not like books that end with the beginning of a sequel. If you invest in over 400 pages you deserve an answer.I do wonder why the fixation with rare books. Dunning started it but others such as Meltzer and now Baldacci have picked it up."
5,Great as always,"What a fantastic writer. Books that you can't put down. ""The Camel Club"" is really a series of books that you can't put down. Great."
4,Great read/formatting issue,"Great read, but my only negative comment would be the formatting. At the start of each chapter, two letters of the first word were left dangling on their own right justified. For example, if the chapter started with the word ""Stone"", ""St"" was on one line and picked up on the next. Needless to say that got annoying.-WG"
5,Fantastic book!,"This is the fourth David Baldacci book that I have read, and I am hooked. This is book 2 of the Camel Club Collection adn I look forward to continuing to read"
4,Nancy Drew meets The Hardy Boys... for grown-ups,"Balducci's thriller is like the grown-up version of the old favorite comfort foods. Think tuna-noodle casserole but made with fresh sauteed mushrooms in a white sauce sparked with sherry. Very nice to hunker down with on a chilly early winter evening. Engaging socially challenged characters, intricate mystery. Back-up provided by the real grown-ups; the FBI obligingly steps in when called upon. Sequel promised. The Camel Club plus Annabelle take on the bad guys once again. What could be better!"
5,The Truth,"I like reading his novels because: !. Lots of action, excitement. 2. It is hard to put the book down once you start reading 3. his fiction is more like reality than fiction 4. what a great author."
3,"Enjoyable...Not his best, but still worth your time.","I enjoyed, once again, reading about the Camel Club and the predicaments that they quite often find themselves. I thought that the book started slowly; however, it redeemed itself as the story shifted into high gear in the second half. Some of the details about the cons that were perpetrated against the unsuspecting victims were, I found to be very interesting. Overall, it is definitely worth your time. Enjoy!!"
1,Not worth the time invested reading it!,"I can't believe this book has received so many 5 star reviews! To me it was like Baldacci got to a point where he thought ""nup, can't be bothered with it anymore, I'll just wrap it up"" - either that or he was past deadline. The `con/casino' story, which I thought was a more interesting plot than the main story, disappeared somewhere half way through the book only to be given a brief paragraph at the very end. Not to mention the ""Scooby Do"" ending that was the old cranky guy fooled them all with a wig and fake beard - laughable!"
3,It really should have been two stories,"This is the first Baldacci book I've read. This one really seemed to be two stores that were combined, in my opinion, very poorly. The book started out emphasizing the casino scam, with a little bit of the other thrown in, and then halfway through it reverses, with only 3 little sections on it in the rest of the book, which covered the espionage bit. The thing connecting the two stories was Annabelle, and it was a very unlikely connection (right before she's gonna flee the country she just happens to read about her old ex-husband's death in the paper and flies across country to attend the funeral - a little unrealistic). I was kind of disappointed with the ending. The espionage bit ended well, but it left much to be desired with the casino and Jerry Bagger.Overall, I did enjoy the book and look forward to reading some more by Baldacci."
2,Why does this guy sell millions?,"Poorly written English - predictible, often idiotic characters - choppy little chapters and stereotypical plot. If MTV did a soap opera they would use this guys's stuff as scripts."
5,Could not put it down!,I am very new to Baldacci's work but I think I am addicted already. Who would have thought anyone could make the Library of Congress such an exciting place. The book is very tight. The bad guys are downright nasty and the good guys are the usual odd lot.Only their unique skills help them solve the crime(s). This one belongs in the rare books section of your library. You will read it many times over and enjoy it each time.
1,If you like Scooby Doo....,"This book started off at a pretty good pace but quickly spiraled downward as the story line became more and more absurd.Essentially, a group of old men, who apparently hang out together, gather as friends in order to monitor the U.S. government and save the world from imminent danger. They call themselves ""The Camel Club.""In this case, a high level government official is murdered as is a caretaker at the Library of Congress.The group springs to action to solve the murders, along with Annabelle--a woman who makes her living hustling others out of their money. Sound ridiculous? It is......The end, which I won't give away here, gets even sillier and is reminiscent of a Scooby Doo cartoon. When they catch one of the evil doers, all I could hear is, ""And I would have gotten away with it too if it hadn't been for you darn old men.....""I don't recommend this book."
4,Kept my Interest,"A collector of lost chances; a collector of a personal item from each of his murder victims. The Speaker of the House is murdered; the Director of the Library of Congress Rare Books dies suddenly; his neighbor is shot dead; a skilled con artist pulls off a big-time con on an Atlantic City casino owner. The Camel Club guys (yes, this is a sequel of sorts) and others get into big trouble. This skillfully told story comes together neatly and leaves the door wide open for the continuing saga. There's plenty of action, and it's well-written. My review cannot do it justice...buy the book."
4,Camels and elephants,"If, like me, you got angry at Baldacci's early work - The Winner for example - where you could see the ending as easily as the elephant in the circus parade, you must have been happy to see The Camel Club. Like that best seller, you will find this one much fun. He does a nice job of entangling two plots and two improbable settings - a casino and the rare book room of the Library of Congress.The ringmaster - a retired spy operating under the nom de zany of Oliver Stone is dedicated to finding ""the truth"" and his elderly gang of friends are of assistance. A new character, Anabelle Conroy, daughter and heir to the family business of a premier con-man enters the scene and promises a number of sequals. These novels promise a series that looks like a thrill ride, good holiday reading, winter by the fire reading and a set up for future beach books. Not yet Hillerman or Burke, but it will cheer you up in the style of Travis McGee, and with extra sidekicks."
2,not his best,"This novel is almost incoherent with a terrible and totally unsatisfying ending.Baldacci has been cashing in on his first and best work ""Absolute Power"" for far too long. Time to get a real job?"
2,Camel Club... it is not,"Listened to the Camel Club, which was excellent... This sounded like it was written by another writer that was not up to the quality of Baldacci."
5,Great Read,"This is a great read, in fact, all of the Camel Club books are really good. I am now enjoying more of David Baldacci's books."
5,Great for all ages,I ordered this book to read with adults with special needs. They really enjoyed learning more about someone they've heard of. Great pictures to keep them interested and enough story give actual facts.
5,A Fine Assortment of Music from Saint-Saens,"Camille Saint-Saens is arguably the most famous French composer, and his large body of works is well-represented here. ""The Swan"", from the Carnival of the Animals, the most recognizable work, is nicely done. Selections include a portion of his Second Piano Concerto, and his Third Violin Concerto, two of his best works. Also featured on this disc are two other works that feature the solo violin: Havanaise, and the Intro and Rondo Capriccioso. Enjoyable works these! A fine variety of other works round out this very nice tour of the great 19th-century French composer's music. This label, Naxos, is widely acclaimed as the absolute best BUDGET classical label. However, don't let the nice price fool you. Naxos delivers fine QUALITY recordings, time after time. The major critics concur. I do also, as in my personal collection I have over 100 CDs from this excellent label. You will not be disappointed with this ""Best Of"" disc."
2,SHELL SEEKERS,NOT AS GOOD AS THE CRITICS WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE. CERTAINLY NOT A NEW YORK BEST SELLER TO ME AT LEAST! PLEASANT READ NOT THRILLING BUT WELL WRITTEN
3,Great for setting...,"The setting of Cornwall in this book is brilliant, but the rest is a bit stilted. The concept of what happens to an inheritance is interesting among siblings, but does drag a bit. Read this if you'll be heading to Cornwall to gain an appreciation of the setting!"
4,Very positive,This was a used book that I had been searching for sometime. It is one of my all time favorite books and R. Pilcher one of my very favorite authors. It is in excellent shape and I am very pleased.
5,None,I loved this book. I did not want it to endI think it is one of my favorite books. I do not wish to spoil the story by telling you all about it but if you like a good story you will like this book
5,One of my-all time favorite books,"A great story with believable characters. I'm re-reading it for what must be the fifth or sixth time. It's a love story but it's not maudlin; the good guys win without it being a cliche'; the dialogue is intelligent and humorous, and the settings are unforgettable. As well, the WWII history is fascinating. I feel the same way about her other novel, Coming Home."
4,Great Book,"Very good book, kept me interested from start to finish. Great believable characters and storyline. First one of Rosamunde Pilchers books I have read and will definately be looking for more."
3,SO FLOG ME . . .,"I just didn't get it. The book was recommended to me by friends who adored it, and I kept waiting for something to happen within the pages. My friends kept saying ""Keep reading"" and I did, but other than it being well written, and maybe a nice period piece, I can't find anything to recommend it. I was never pulled into the story and didn't care a whit about the characters. This book is widely popular, so maybe I'm missing something, but I wasn't compelled at all and had to force myself to turn the pages."
2,Product was fine; content over-rated,"I bought this having seen the title on a 'Best of...' list. The book was in fine condition, but I don't see what the fuss was about. I find the writing somewhat amateurish and the story isn't all that intriguing. I'm halfway through and determined to finish it, but 350 pages in and it reminds me of a glorified soap opera."
1,The Shell Seekers,The condition of this book was very disappointing. It was listed as good or very good but the pages are very yellowed and overall condition is fair at best. I have purchased used products from you before and I have been very satisfied. Not this time. (The book is an excellent read.)
4,The Shell Seekers is fantastic,"Rosamund Pilcher does a fantastic job of writing in a style that immerses the reader in the very lives of the character she creates. Although the book jumps around into different time periods, it stays true to each character and leaves nothing hanging.This book was fantastic and ended far too soon."
4,The Shell Seekers,"Fast reading. Fun book! It is the kind of book, you do not want to put down until you have finsihed."
3,A pleasant escape,"The Shell Seekers is pleasant escape reading. The kind of book good as an airplane or beach read in the summer or with a cup of tea by the fire in the winter. I recognized the stereotypes of siblings that Pilcher describes as being representative of my own family members. I thoroughly enjoyed the setting -- a few places in England. The story was fairly predictable yet I was compelled to keep reading to see if it turned out as I expected. It did. I don't feel I was a better person for having read this book, but I did enjoy it and appreciated the escape."
5,A must Read,"This has to be one of my all-time favorites. I was introduced to this book several years ago and loved it. As with any yearly tradition, I pull my worn copy from my bookshelf once a year and curl up with this book. Ms. Pilcher spins a marvelous tale that weaves you in and around the characters in this book and no matter how many times I read it, I'm always left wanting more."
5,An absolutely beautiful tale,"""The Shell Seekers"" is a true modern masterpiece - a great book with a fascinating and endearing story, wonderful characters with complex and believable natures, and set in some of the most picutresque country side in the world. It is difficult to do this book enough justice - it is simply magnificent. Have a laugh and a good cry with this book (and you would have to be very strong not to shed a tear!), and hold it close to your heart.It is a book to love and treasure and always recommend to others."
4,Abridged version,I love reading this book as it really brings to my mind what I should consider important in life: family and friends.I recently checked out the audio book from my local library and Lynn Redgrave does a wonderful job at reading the story and decided that I wanted my own copy.The library's copy was unabriged where this particular copy is abridged and it tends to loose some of the story and the pieces of each character.
5,A great escape from every day life,"I read Rosamunde Pilcher to escape and every one of her books takes you away. I love her ability to give you all the little details about the settings and people without bogging you down with minutia. A delightful, relaxing read."
3,WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED,"Everyone I know has read this book and raved about it. Okay, it's well written and the characters are kind of interesting, but I plodded through the book. I was told to ""Keep reading, it gets really good!"" so I finished it and was disappointed. I thought it was slow and needed a shot of adrenalin."
5,Another Great Book by Pella!,I have to say I was a little skeptical about the 2nd book in the Daughters of Fortune series because I liked the first one so much! But it lived up to my expectations. I became completely involved with Blair's story this time. She was such a spoiled brat in the first one but I grew to like her. Being in the middle of a war sure changes peoples outlooks on life. I'm just hoping the 3rd one lives up to my expectations as well
3,Glad I got it.,"The book was ancient, but did'nt smell old or mildewed. When I receive book one my set will be complete. This my second all time favorite book set!"
4,Somewhere a Song,"This book arrived in good condition and very quickly! I love this series, it has some very profound Christian statements in it and the author weaves a very good story."
1,1 star only because there's no zero.,"As a longtime Ultima Online player (3 1/2 years) I cant even begin to describe how angry and upset I am at what EA has done to this once great game with the release of Age of Shadows.They've changed Ultima Online from a fun, easy to understand game to a complicated, irritating headache. It's not even the same game anymore! It's a poorly thought out clone of Diablo2 and that was a loser of a game and Age of Shadows is no different.Couple this with EA's poor to nonexistant customer service I strongly urge anyone who's considering buying Age of Shadows to save themselves the [money] for the game and the $... a month to play it. Not to mention saving yourself the hassle of dealing with EA's poor excuse for customer service.I'm going to cancel my Ultima Online account right after posting this review. If a 3 1/2 year Ultima Online player doing that dos'nt say it all about Age of Shadows I dont know what will."
2,10 bucks a month for servers that are crashed half the time?,"I used to be a fan of UO but now its just not worth it, the gameplay still keeps its goodness and that's why I gave it 2 starts and not 1. But the servers are getting worse and worse, and now it's just not worth paying 10 bucks a month for a game that is laggier than Diablo 2. Don't get me wrong this is a good game with good gameplay and great fun but the lag is destroying it. If they decide to fix the servers I will bring my review up to a 5. If they make the game free but keep the laggy servers then I will only change it to a 3 because that would prove that Electronic Arts are just too lazy and don't care enough about the players enjoyment of the game to fix anything and they would have basically just give up on the game.If you want a free online RPG with less lag then get Diablo 2.If you want an MMORPG with little lag then get Asheerons Call, Asherons Call 2, or Dark Age of Camelot."
1,Hmmmm.....,"well for one thing it gets quite boring, there arent many jobs to select from, the graphics ..., theres bugs, not for dial - up users well its a waste of time its terrible trust me there are a lot better mmorpgs out there like everquest and please dont buy this and stay away from it if you see it on the shelves trust me this ..."
2,Moving Backwards,I'm not sure what they were thinking. The changes that went into this game should have been saved for a different game entirely. I've been playing Ultima Online since September of 1997 and after upgrading to this new release its possible that the game is at its worst. For new players I suppose they wouldn't know the difference. For older players? I've got a mage who can't leave the house without dying anymore because they thought it would be clever to change the magic resisance rules. As far as the advertisment of building your own house? I've been in the game for over five years and the friend that I have that does have a house bought his on Ebay. I upgraded figuring I'd be able to buy a house in the new lands. ..... I've found Dark Age Of Camelot to be not nearly as deep a game but the people are FAR more polite and the game has infinitely superior graphics.Thanks and good luck to you all.
1,No Hooded Shroud of Shadows,"Don't order from here if you expect to get it. They give you the run around and you never end up with it. Other than the fact that you miss out on this item it is fun, but order it from somewhere where you can really get the Hooded Shroud of Shadows."
1,Outdated gameplay,"You would think that a mmorpg game ,backed by a large gaming company like EA, would revamp this game to keep up with modern game play. In it's time, UO was an awesome game. But now games like Neverwinter Nights have left this game behind in the past where it belongs. I quit playing UO in disgust waiting for phase 3 of the Housing to kick in over six months ago. Checking the UO website I have found to date they still have not started phase 3 . The quest,(yes singular)were drawn out and you had to wait for the next part of the quest to be activated, what a joke. The expansion pack will be more of the same. Don't waste your money on this game."
1,Electronic Arts dropped the ball on this one.,"This game was released 5 days ago and it still is un-playable. Origin systems, the designer, failed to test the game properly before introducing it. It was sold on a pre-release basis with added extras. Massive problems have arisen since the release ... Buyer beware! ..."
1,Waste of Cash,"OSI really Drolled the ball on this way, they have NO CLUE what the players want or how do get it done, the Shards have been down for 2 days now, and no clue when they'll be back up, the Bugs and issues are Everywhere, and they are in ""closed ranks"" people are quitting left and right and they refuse to answer the simplest Questions... STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME."
3,A turn for the worst,"I played UO for three years and then quit for the last two so after a two year break, icame back expecting myself to love it more than ever. But NO NO NO. Why? THis came is based purely on ITems. I played back when there was no trammel, only felucca. There was tons of PvP, guild warfare. IT was great. But then something happened. 100 resist useless. it used to be that your skills counted not your armor. THe delay time for casting spells is insane. You didnt used to have to spend 6 months working up the money to buy the armor and jewelry you need. So anyone thinking about coming back to UO. DON'T. I suggest you try out DArk age of Camelot, a good game from what i hear. well thanx OSI for ruining the best MMORPG there was."
1,Not for DIAL-UP!!! Don't buy it if you are on dial-up..,I've played Ultima Online for years on Dial-Up and now I can't play it at all. I'm not alone either. Check out the Ultima Online message boards. Everyone on Dial-Up either can not play at all or can do nothing but sit in an empty town and do crafts.Not worth the money!!!
1,Very Disappointed,constant struggle to connect to servers; constant lag when you do connect during peak hours; poor customer service through game/website/telephone calls; 90% of game play time is spent dealing with continuous bugs
5,Mixed Feelings,"Ultima Online is a fun game but I have mixed feelings about this latest version. I've spent countless hours playing this game over the past three years. However, this latest version just doesn't have the same feel. The new character classes are great and I think they accomplish what a lot of players have tried to do over the years but, don't get sold on the custom housing feature. It's a really neat feature but, you will probably have to spend even more money online to buy a house before you will get to use that feature. If you are a veteran upgrading you will probably find this to be a whole new game. If you are new to Ultima Online you will find plenty to excite you and keep you entertained for a long time."
3,"Some bugs, but getting better","What happened with the Age of Shadows launch surprised everybody. The login and registration servers got hammered. Why? Because more people ordered AoS than anybody had a right to expect. What does that mean? People still want to play UO.There are a lot of changes in AoS, and change scares people. MOST of the changes are decent, keeping the game fresh, which is a challenge for a 5 year old title. When you do massive changes to a title, your bound to get bugs. The Development team is working 7 days a week working on fixing the problems. Age of Shadows is a must have upgrade, but be warned - there are some major bugs still. Give it a month and things will definatly be much better."
3,ultima Online:Age of shadows,"I really disliked this version over the previous, its really a waste of money. In my personal opinion I'd rather play Avalon-rpg.com if i have to pay a monthly fee to play a game anyways. Its more diverse with better roleplaying and killing."
1,Not recommended.,Age of Shadows is very bugged to say the least. I've been very disappointed with game play. There is almost constant lag and disconnects due to server overloads because of lack of preparation by company. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone at the current time.
1,OSI fails,"Well I started playing this game before all of the UO grandeur, and that is what I truley miss. With each of the subsequent upgrades and patches, I believe UO has gone down in rank bringing it alas to the humble rating of one star. This newest version is perhaps the worst debacle to visit the virtual world that is Ultima Online, and to anyone who has witnessed the mayhem inherent to Age of Shadows will understand of what I speak. If you are knew to this gameplay experience then I tell you you have already missed the best of what was to offer and furthermore it will never return. This version of Ultima Online was a debacle from the point when I ""preordered"" it. With a slew of daily bugs and client crashes, I'm sure everyone who purchases this game will be quite disappointed. To those who have permanently quit the UO community I can't say that I blame you.Oh and ask yourself: ""I wonder why EA removed the daily opinion poll from the Age of Shadows website?"""
5,Playing UO until Ultima X: Odyssey comes out,"I have been awaiting Ultima X: Odyssey for a few months now and so when I found out that EA is offering a deal for UO players who want to play UO, I thought I would give UO a try and guess what? I LOVE IT. The best thing is that UXO is going to take a pretty amazing PC, but when I installed the 2D installation of UO onto my subnotebook -- I can play this super cool ""Old Skool"" UO and since I don't have any history on it, I can say that I am pretty psyched. But I am still waiting for UXO. The lyric is true, though: ""And if you can't be with the one you love / Love the one you're with"" So, now I am addicted to it and really can't get enough it the game and even play it during my breaks at work since I am sill that way. And its really only a little over $12/month, so its cool with me. And its been around so long that I have neven gotten into a corner I couldn't get out of."
2,Fun Doesn't Last Forever,I purchased ultima online a while ago and bought hte new expantion. The game is fun but once you do the basics fr each charcter it gets boring. The game is alot of repition and is very hard to get a good character.
1,If there was an option for 0 stars I would of gave it,EA took a once great game and added 1000's of bugs and hacks. Its the worse thing to happend to an online game.
3,Reads like a textbook,"This book is full of great information and is well organized; however, it has the read quality of a textbook. If this is what you are looking for, than this is the book for you. It really works best as a reference guide."
4,Excellent casual referance,This book has achieved just the right balance between throughness and overview so that I have been able to refer to it in a casual manner (once every 3-6 months) and been able to use the results without taking a new college course. I am a practicing Analog electronics engineer and thermal engineering is something I only do once (perhaps more ?) during a design/project.
2,great as a reference but with some confusion,this book is good as a reference however the two authors gave contradictory and erroneous analysis on some pagesexample: page 5.18 -5.19 totally contradicts page 7.10; 7.11.and also in 7.10 W2 is totaly wrong with sin.
3,Decent with no new information,"Just about everything that can be known about Napoleon (exept perhaps whether he was poisoned) are known today. So this book adds little value in terms of historical importance. Given this, I put higher emphasis on the readabilty and the entertainment value of the book. Although not badly written, I felt the writing could have been more salacious. It is written somewhat like a college history textbook. More than a few times, I put this book down and fell asleep. Very few lives have been as remarkable and as interesting as Napoleon's. This book is a classic case in which the author fails to emphasize on the interesting aspects of his life (his rise, historical significance, brilliance, lovers, marriage life, and how people worshipped him etc). Instead, each aspect of his life seems to be given even distribution. The book could have had more sizzle without compromising historical integrity."
3,Decent,"This is a decent biography but nothing really groundbreaking. However in his conclusion, discussing Napoleon as a military commander, McLynn claims that he should not be counted among the great( peerless )commanders in history. I wonder where he got that. Napoleon fought more battles than Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Gustavus Adolphus, and Frederick the Great combined and won all but a handful of them. No other commander in military history fought more battles under more different conditions than he did."
5,One of the best Napoleonic bios ever!,"I have been studying this mystery of a man for many years and when I picked this book up, I could not set it down. Not only does it go in depth, but the author also mentions several things I had NEVER read anywhere else (i.e. the Little Red Man, etc.) and I would recommend it over almost every Bonaparte bio currently in print."
3,A good book on Napoleon,"A good life story on Napoleon - full, complete, but there is not much on the man himself, more the history of his life. If you want to learn about the battles, the people around him etc, this is a good book. If you are looking for a book about the man as in his character, then I would suggest this book:The History Of Napoleon Bonaparte: A Man Of Genius, Vision And Power"
4,A Good Historical Overview,"Probably not the best of Napoleon bios, but for the naive like myself, it does the job quite well. Gets a little repetitive in wording at times, but will hold the average readers attention. Especially if you're a history buff. Decent psychological insight into the the mind of the man Napoleon."
2,Too much psychoanalysis,"I quit reading this book after 80 pages. At times I thought it good, but I got fed up with the constant reference to psychoanalysis."
1,Won't work on Pioneer A06 (1.08 firmware),"This is the first media I have encountered that wont work on the A06. Defective disks??? According to Metline's compatibility list, these disks should work on the A06 with 1.08 firmware."
1,Incompatible Media,"I also have an ""old"" Pioneer Drive - DVR-104 (May 2003). There is nothing in this ""editorial review"" or ad that suggests that there is an incompatibility with slower drives. I guess 25 DVD-RWs can make good coasters."
1,Just did not work in Pioneer DVR-105,"I bought Pioneer DVR-105 in March 2003. Till date I have had zero coasters and every media has worked fine. This is the first that did not work. It may be because of 4x rewrite speed - my writer supports only 2x. However, its not mentioned anywhere that this media cannot be burnt on 2x and I did not find any other reviews."
1,Won't Work With Pioneer DVR-810H,Incompatible. Unit does not recognize this media. Unit is DVD-RW compatible. What a waste of money.
2,Really not for video,"Run this disk through ""DVD Identifier"" and it turns out this is a ""restricted"" disk, meaning it is intended for data only. What you want is ""General Purpose"" and this is not it. That probably explains a lot of the trouble people are having. Nowhere is this fact made clear for people who want to use it in DVD recorders, not computers. My Toshiba D-R2 insists this disk is ""write protected""."
1,Cannot burn using Sony DRU-500A writer,"I have been able to burn other RiDATA/Ritek DVD, such as DVD-R, DVD+R with different speed with my SOny DRU-500A. However, I just cannot make this DVD-RW work on the writer.Tried different DVD burning softwares but all of them failed. I suspect that the problem is in this blank media, not in the software or hardware."
2,Please be fair to Ritek,"While this media is new and the faster writing of -RW has yet to be perfected it is not fair to blame Ritek or Amazon for leaving out the fact that older drives (especially year old Pioneer 104s) might have trouble writing to something not conceived of at the time of production. Correct writing strategy requires that your drive firmware recognize the disc media ID code. This means that you have to visit the Pioneer website and update your firmware in order to write to new media. If there is no newer firmware you have to stick to older media. Also, both the 104 and the 106 are limited to writing -RW media at a speed of 2X regardless of the rated speed on the media.That being said, the quality of the burn with these discs is just fair. If you want a better disc go to the much better Ritek +RWs at the same price (assuming that your drive will work with +RW)."
4,Look what a hurricane can do,"Rob Wyatt, a lawyer in Charleston, SC, has been drifting through life, until a hurricane blows through and with its damage knocks him for a loop. But he soon meets 19-year-old Billie Poe, whom he helps out of a marriage and into his own life. Of course the novel is a voyage of self-discovery for Rob, especially regarding why he failed getting the girl of his life (Louise) before meeting Billie. I thought this book better than Humphreys's RICH IN LOVE but not as good as DREAMS OF SLEEP."
3,Real Avg !,real average ... like all Naxos CD's ... 3rd rate.have any Naxos fans even heard of HvK and the BPO ???didn't think so !
3,It works but it's fragile,"Strengths: You will be able to pick up stronger signals or maybe one or two extra signals. However, don't expect to connect to your mom's wireless network if she's more than one block away. It is a lightweight device with cool packaging.Weaknesses: Unfortunately, it is very fragile you have to be very careful not to break it. There is no way to fix it, so it keeps moving whenever I move my laptop. I think it should be cheaper (got mine for $70)"
1,noth worth it,I am not sure why they are still selling this. It was made in 2005. The accompanying software is no longer supported. Don't waste your time/ money. I returned it to Amazon without problems 2 days after it arrived.This item should be removed from resale anywhere.
1,Unusable,I tried three different copies of this thing at my local computer store. All had parts fall out when I attempted to install the battery. No one at the support desk could get it to work.
4,Power now,Good service & quality.. On time and as advertised.Will continue to buy online due in part to the quality products & service.
2,Boring,"The book did not pick up until the end. The older brother got on my damn nerves. The whole book was about him I wanted to learn more about the other characters. And I thought Desire had 4 kids what happen to the younger boy that she and Ice had, they had 2 kids right?????? Loved slim!!!!!!!!! And I liked the first Block Party but this one was slow and boring................................The last 5 chapters were the best part. I don't know if I even want to read the 3rd book. I can not find a description anywhere. I would be made as hell if it was more of the same thing."
5,DAYUM BANGMAN!,"ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS PSST,PSST BANGMAN HAS DONE IT AGAIN. AL-SAADIQ BANKS IS PHENOMENAL...THIS BOOK IS ON FIREEEEEEEE. HE JUST KEEP HITTING US WITH THE DAYUM WHAT THE WORD FOR HIM IS THAT HE IS DOING DA THE DAYUM THING. IF YOU DIDN'T READ HIS BOOKS YOU IS MISSING OUT BIG TIME,.........I FEEL FOR YA.

4,Excellent Unheard Stories,"This is one of the better books on fire side chats. The stories were all unheard of by me, and I have been studying the Civil War for over 35 years. This book gives great insight into the lives of our ancestors that fought and lived during the Civil War. It is told in a humorous way that is easy to laugh at the fun and still shudder at the horror of war.I reccommend this book highly to students and followers of the Civil War."
5,"Great ""tunes""","I agree with the above review. This is incredibly good music. The sonatas with violin and guitar are beautiful, and the caprices are certainly astounding. Everyone knows Paganini was an unmatched violinist, but he was also a great composer. This disc is a steal."
2,"sweet tone, bad recording","NAXOS is good to discover new/younge artists, but it should also apply good techniques in the recording. If Ilya is playing in front of us, we will be easily moved, but the bad recording simply destroyed his performance"
4,Miracle Mile,"In the mid 70's, Dana Cooper and Shake Russell were the hottest commodities in regards to folk/rock music in Houston and through- out Texas. Its sad to see such great artists CD's not as readily available nationally as they are in Texas. They are STILL pumping out great music. With Miracle Mile, it appears that Dana has taken a step toward commercialization and one step away from folk, although the folk roots are still quite obvious. He is a GREAT folk songwriter as evidenced byprevious songs such as ""My Gift to You"" and ""I Keep Having This Dream"" from previous albums. Will the songs on this CD hold true? I think some will. Those of you who are fans of Dana Cooper, should add this CD to your collection."
5,Among my all-time favorites of Dana Cooper's CDs,"Great songwriter/lyricist from my hometown in Missouri. Miracle Mile stays fresh through the years. Thought of mostly now as a excellent solo singer/songwriter, but this effort contains songs that are more polished and produced than his others (not to put down his previous and newer releases). But with co-producer/engineer/guitarist Josh Leo and a cast of excellent musicians - Lyle Lovett, George Marinelli (Bonnie Raitt), Maura O'Connell) Cooper weaves a masterpiece. Put it in your player and enjoy as he lays it all out on the table and you are taken on a musical pleasure ride."
4,J.C. Chasez....Hmm...,"J.C. Chasez is what makes *NSYNC harmonize theing song so good. An underated singer and with much vocal talent and energy, he is what makes *NSYNC harmonize better and makes a song a ""pop"" song. Although I feel that his voice wasn't as great as singing a real deep vocal tenor on an example song like ""This I Promise You,"" he still gives the teenage audience an exciting fixture to ""what is he really going to do on his record?"" and is it ""a record like his fella Justin Timberlake's?"" We can sure expect a different vibe to the album of Mr. Chasez. As expected of the ""Game is Over"" on the *NSYNC's Celebrity album, we get that ""Drumline"" vibe this this album as well."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"I didn't know who this was the first time that I heard it. I found that fact impressive given that this artist could more or less insure a hit by sticking to the formula that his very successful group has already proven. Instead, he chose to explore new ground. This song is very different from most of the things you will hear on the airwaves today, and truthfully the first time I heard it I wasn't sure if I liked it. However, it has a very infectious beat and cadence, and it was locked in my brain in no time. I think this is a worthy purchase, and I look forward to other solo offerings by this artist."
4,After a few listens it certainly does grow on you...,"I am first to admit, I hated this song when I first heard it! But after listening to it a bit more I found myself singing along! It has a very interesting quality, and a VERY different sound, but it aint all bad! :)"
3,JC Chasez solo debut,This song has some good points and some bad points. the verses that he sings are alright andthe chorus is not too great. I don't think he has matched Justin yet but I still would go ahead and buy his new album because it will have many great dance beats. JC is very talented and I really think you will love his new album.
1,"Make it Stop, Make It Stop!","Oh the horror, the humanity!!!! AHHHHHHH!!!!! Who ever likes this bottom dwelling music needs their ears checked (if they actually can hear at all after this) and their head examined to fullest extent. I like NSYNC, but this, JC go back to NSYNC, because this NSUKS."
1,Simply Awful,"This is the saddest of all pop music that I have ever heard. Who allowed this to be broadcast on the radio? I am not a pop hater, I like most music, and I even respect Justin Timberlake as a talented singer-- but come on! All JC does in this song is yell and make a lot of unpleasant noise! The trumpets in the background, combined with his yelling, make this sound like a freak circus."
5,This Man Can Sing,"With pipes like his, JC Chasez of *Nsync is by far the strongest singer in the group. Just thinking of him as ""one of the guys from *NSNYC"" is a drastic understatement of this man's talent. Not only can his sing to the likes of Brian McKnight, but he like Brian, he writes most of his music. He's even known for writing and co-writing some of *NSYNC's biggest hits. I am awaiting his upcoming CD because he's just as talented and good looking as his bandmate Justin Timberlake. Who know's maybe more. This single is just a preview of what's to come and it's all grown-up."
4,Nice vocal harmonies with a tribal drumline..,"This is a tough song to rate. The lyrics and song structure are slapping simple, but the vocal melodies and bass line are well structured. The instrumental bridge doesn't really fit the song, but everything else goes together nicely.JC Chasez, formerly the vocal lead of N'SYNC with Justin Timberlake, has a great single on his hands. I wasn't expecting a ""hip-hop"" type song because of his silky smooth vocals, but I'm happy with it. I'm looking forward to his official album - should be good!"
2,Antique Woman,"This is not a bad album but there is really only one GREAT track (#3). The rest is a quiet electronic breeze with some noise thrown in now and again to wake you up. I'd say it would be perfect for some non-obtrusive study or relaxing music, just to play for the sake of having some music on. A bit of a disappointment from the BUBBLECORE label."
5,love this cd!,My daughter loves this cd! We bought this cd to do yoga to but we also sing and dance along with all the songs. It's a great cd to spend some family time together.
1,What's on this CD,"I'm not reviewing the CD, I'm reviewing your listing. What's with this ""Best of"" title where I can't find out what's on the CD. Better info please."
5,just great regae,"This album, Hebron gate is the standard for Groundation. It's what Exodus was for Bob marley and Handsworth revolution for Steel Pulse.Only solid tracks , especially the last two songs wich are with the congos and don carlos. classics already.most of the songs are played at every concert. the following cd's were less i think. sometimes groundation loses itself in complexity .Zion....dreaming of an iron gate...Dragon....Fire gonna burn them All!!need I to say more? Get this one and forget the rest."
5,Give thanks and praises!,"Make a joyful noise, brothers and sisters, for Roots is not a thing of the past. If someone told me that one of the finest roots albums I would ever here not only was not from Jamaica, but also was released in the 21st century I would have been skeptical.Then I stumbled across this treasure - a magnificent blend of horns, guitar, searing organ, and vocal splendor. The lead vocals have a delightfully raspy feel, picture Ziggy Marley meets Burning Spear with a hind of Alpha Blondy. The brass is tight and brings in a nice jazzy feel.These elements combine to bring forth songs of struggle, of hope, of strength, and of spirit in line with any of the great Rasta offerings of the 70's. They speak of pain and suffering, but with a promise of liberation that will set the listener's soul free.Get this album and rejoice!"
3,Not for me,My first problem with this band is the singer. He just tries too hard. It's full of cliches and bringing in famous Reggae names to collaborate doesn't help. It might help catch people's attention but this is just re-heated stuff.There's so much good Reggae out there that this is just not enough for me. Maybe if you're new to Reggae... Next!
1,Come On People!!!,"This album stinks. I have over 2000 reggae CDs and I don't get the hype. Groundation does indeed have musical talent, but the lead vocalist sounds horrible. The only thing worth mentioning is Don Carlos and Cedric Muton on the last two songs. They are so...so, but just when you start enjoying the songs, the lead vocalist from Groundation chimes in and ruins the tunes.I am very disappointed in the CD. Sorry to all the people who like them, but Groundation is nothing more than wanna be reggae artists who obviously do have a knack at convincing the unrefined ear they are real."
2,Quality issue with this one...,"Before buying this wallet, I had a two-tone red and black Taxi Wallet that I used for many years without any trouble. The stitching around the coin pocket eventually started to come apart and I decided it would be easier to order a new wallet rather than trying to find a way to repair my old one. I was excited to have a ""pretty"" Taxi Wallet this time around but, upon receiving it, was unimpressed with the quality of the leather. It seemed much thinner than my old wallet. But I transferred all my stuff to the new model and tossed it in my purse. After just a few months of use, the snap that holds the coin flap down broke off, rendering the pocket useless. Unfortunately, it was too late to return the item but it was definitely too *soon* for this item to fall apart. Needless to say, I am very disappointed with this wallet..."
5,Greatest wallet EVER!,"I am one who has a ton of wallets and always changing them out. But when I got this one, it really is the all in one wallet. I am absolutely in love with it and have not switched our yet. I will definetely be buying another pattern in the future."
2,"Interesting design, but....","This is an interesting, imaginative design. (Yes, the front face is a bit scary!).I downgraded it because I was disappointed in the colors of the product. They are weak, and appear ""spotty"" (think pixelated), and faded. I returned the wallet, owing to this. If you can live with that, then this is a cute, unusual design.The taxi wallets are great if you need a small, secure wallet. I use mine daily.... please see my review under the Nancy Drew image wallet (where you'll find lots of comments about the wallet design, etc.). That has very strong, bright colors, and I receive comments on it almost daily.Enjoy!"
2,Doesn't Live Up to Potential,"The story begins with potential about a farm girl that fears she won't be able to handle managing her family's farm when she gets older. However, the story structure is made up of almost issolated events in Kate's life so that the plot does not flow properly. There is more telling than showing in some places and some of the sentences are oddly worded, making it difficult to understand. The story is told in first person past tense, but in some places present tense is mixed in, contributing to difficult reading. I expected more and was disappointed."
3,Comforter Set,"Pretty set, but quality is not that good. Picture looks like it would be a smooth satin finish, but it is a lot rougher and kind of itchy. More for looks than for function."
4,Not really a mix CD,"This is as much a response to the previous review as it is a review of my own.This is not really a mix CD. The tracks may be mixed together but that is just for flow purposes.This is an original album. They are all his tracks, and this CD should be viewed as such.Some are edits and remixes of older tracks such as Hardhouse Raver and B Raver, but there is a lot of new stuff on here like Monochroma, Samurai and The Rain.If you are expecting a Yoji mix, it's not but it' not his fault if you didn't know what you were buying."
4,GREAT !!,"Great CD, though not the best from Biomehanika.My Favorite Track ""The Dignity""> I think I've listened to it on an average on ONE day ... like 15 times. lolSo really if you like Trance ... this is hard trance, but you'll like it *wink*"
1,Spring Worn out. It Won't Rewind!,I was going to give this 5 stars last year because I really liked it. But the spring is now worn out after about a year of use and the hose won't wind up completely.
3,a bit disappointed ...,"so this is what Naxos is all about eh ?get the cheapest East European symphony with a bunch of rookie no name soloists recorded asap and release lots of stuff quickly .... hmmm.not the way to go ... the selection is ok ... music is ok ... but not what I was expecting .... for real music, ie Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Wagner, go with Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic ... serious music by serious artists !"
3,Flat,The medium squeaks a lot (very hard to control if it's possible at all). The hard sounds very flat even when the tuner says it's the right pitch.
3,It was beautiful but came broken,The cup and saucer were very pretty but not packaged very well. It came broken. I had to return the item although the return went well.
5,full of emotion,"I was pulled into this book and couldn't put it down.The characters Of Ashley and Dillon show the kind of relationship that all of us want to have. Even thru their down times, they hang in there and keep their love strong.G.Glass is an exceptional writer and i look forward to reading more from her in the future."
2,Peeved,"For the most part, this book has good intentions, and I applaud the author for her bravery in holding her creation aloft for all to see. The plot isn't concise as it waffles through time and experiences, but the writing created some warmth for the characters. I liked that they had distinct flaws and I liked that they did have to work to achieve goals. I did not like that the main character was dull, and I seriously have to question the decision of naming a protagonist ""Spit"".My largest amount of frustration arises again in the form of bad editting. I feel very strongly that a book is the result of a partnership between author and editor. In this case, I believe the author was done a disservice as the editting was deplorable. I strongly encourage the editor to use spell-checks and grammar checks in the future."
1,Editor should be fired,"A first grader could write a story with no worse spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors than this book. While the story left much to be desired, it is not the worst that I have read. The editing is appalling. The writer needs to take some basic English courses if this is the best that she can do, and the editor needs to go back to grade school. It was almost too distracting to read. The further I got, the more appalled I was. I don't know how this book made it to print, or how the publisher allowed it. Don't waste your money, or more importantly, your time, with this one."
5,Spitfire is hot!,"You won't be able to put this book down. I also understand there may be a movie, in development based on this book. ;)"
5,Exquisite,"Nuanced, finely honed, crafted songwriting, sung with equal aplomb. A shimmering jewel of a record."
1,Incomplete!,Beware! The tannhauser overture is not the complete version. I received this as a gift because this overture is one of my favourites only to find out to my dismay that it is only about three quarters in length. This is inexcusable since there is no mention of this anywhere on the CD.
3,Miss Piggy Rules,"If you love Miss Piggy, you will enjoy this book, for some of her wit, charm and karate-chopping style come through loud and clear, emphasis on loud. While not as insightful or enjoyable as ""Miss Piggy's Guide to Life,"" which seems more consistent with The Diva Herself, this is a very funny read. It won't do you any good to read with an eye for consistency--you simply can't reconcile Piggy's rules with her undying love for Kermit--but if you read with an eye for humour, you won't be disappointed."
1,Very disappointing! Not a good Miss Piggy book!,"I agree with the reviewer from Kansas 100%. I wonder if the reviewer from MA is a member of what a friend of mine calls ""The Dead Puppeteer Society"", someone who worships all things Henson and has hardly what you could call a discriminating eye. I thought when I bought ""Miss Piggy's Rules"", I would enjoy Miss Piggy ripping up that dopey book, ""The Rules"", and maybe something about the legendary Miss Piggy-Kermit romance. The book is hardly that! It's a debasement of the lady herself. The Muppet people really blew it"
1,NO WAY THIS'LL MAKE THE TOP TEN!!!!!!,"Since the reader from MA mentioned ""Miss Piggy's Guide to Life"", I dug out my old copy and compared it to ""Miss Piggy's Rules"". Teddy says she's always lusted after men. In ""Rules"", maybe, but in ""Life"" she lusts only after Kermit. And while in ""Rules"" she's after men for their money, in ""Life"" she says, and I quote ""The best thing in my life that's green isn't money."" So I think MA should do his homework. ""Rules"" is nothing like ""Life"" - it STINKS! This book is yet one more reason for me not to watch the Muppets any more"
3,Amazon item,"Shipped in a timely manner, however could have shown a bit more detail info. on how many episodes it had or if it's the complete tv series which in this case it's not, not too pleased because it's too short."
3,In small doses it works...,"Season one is the stronger of the two seasons on DVD. Maybe it's the guest stars, the fresh ideas, storylines, etc. I personally found myself wanting to see more of Dr. Myron Finkelstein (Fred Landedberg) I think he was really underused. Overall the show is entertaining but it's best to watch one episode at a time (small doses) and the improv is only as good as the subject and actors, it's no Curb. IMDB has it listed as three seasons but the DVD Complete set is two seasons. I think this show had some webisodes too bad they aren't included on the DVD. I would suggest viewing some clips on the web, Netflix it, or rent first. If you find yourself laughing at the dialogue it's probably worth adding to your collection. Get the full set though unless you already own season one."
2,Weak,"My wife and I were very dissatisfied with this product. Its highest level of stimulation is rather weak. You get what you pay for, and you don't pay very much."
3,Ummmmmm ok,"It was just ok. The vibrations are medium strength and it's not too noisy but there's nothing spectacular about this toy except the price. I think the finger seperations are a little wide for a woman's hands, but maybe that's just me."
2,Luv,Cancel reply to the two level of unfortunate that I can come up with attitude game is a touchy subject to the hands on children's museum of unfortunate events rent movie the series of unfortunate events rent movie the series of unfortunate events rent movie the series of unfortunate unfortunate events events rent movie the series of
3,More of the same,"The Baudelaire orphans are sent to a boarding school where, once again, Count Olaf manages to hatch an evil plan while witless adults are unable to protect the children. However, in this book we get a glimpse into a bit of Count Olaf's past, Lemony Snicket's past, and are left hanging with several clues that might be able to stop him once and for all.Until the new information toward the end of the book, I have to say I found this book to be just more of the same stuff as the others, and wasn't terribly entertained."
5,Fabulous ideas to cut fat out of your diet,"I know that some fat is good in our diets and I don't advocate eliminating all of it; however I know I personally can eat WAY too much in my desserts. This book has given me tremendous insight into how to reduce and/or cut out the fat in my desserts. The recipes are tasty, moist when they're supposed to be, chewy when they're supposed to be, crisp when they're supposed to be (you get the idea - these are not gooey, nasty fat replacements). I especially like the Prune Puree and have used it in other recipes very successfully. I highly recommend this book as a sensible addition to your healthy living cookbooks."
2,Save your money!,"I bought this book because it sounded like it would have good receipes. Once I got the book, I didn't find any of them appetizing. A good rule of thumb is if a recipe calls for oil, substitute apple sauce and you'll be cutting the fat.."
5,Your baby will grow up with this story,"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas when he was eight months old. He is now 15 months old and has it read to him every night. He loves this book. He often grabs it from his book table. It's the perfect book for small children - short, colorful and rhymey. Just remember that the book actually ends on the back cover, which I thought was a little strange. My sister has memorized this book since she reads it every night and so have I. I plan on giving this book at baby showers."
2,not as good as the others in the series,"This book just isn't as good as the others in the series. I like the artwork with the seed beads as roe, etc. but the flow of the poetry just isn't all that.The one I love is ""Hola Jalepenjo"". It's far better than this one."
3,pricey,i bought this thinking it would be more of an explaining sushi thing... but no its just a cute lil story. the book is smaller than i thought too. a bit too pricey as well.
2,doesn't compare to Hola Jalapeno,I bought this because my two and half year old nephew has enjoyed Hola Jalapeno for many months and I thought I'd try something new. He loves to be read to but this one just won't keep his interest. I'll keep trying. Maybe when he's a bit older.
5,SushiLoving Toddler!,"My daughter received this book and 2 others (Yum Yum Dim Sum, and Hola Jalapeno) as a gift when she was born. In the last 3 years we have grabbed these books over and over again at bedtime, to go out for dinner, overnight trips... all the time! She recognizes the pieces of sushi she just had for dinner and LOVES to read the book to herself (from memory... of course). The illustrations are vivid and fun to look at and the rhyming words are like lyrics to her (""Someday I'll Eat With Chopsticks, But Today Just With My Hands"")! She often asked for ""Miso In My Sippy Cup, Tofu In My Bowl""!Don't miss this one! Makes a great gift for your little ones and thier friends!!!!"
5,Great for Little Ones,The whole Wild About Safety series is a great way to teach kids safety. My nephew watches this one over and over
3,Okay but...,"The numbers are hard to read - experts won't care, but newcomers have to leave the line and approach closer to make them out."
4,Great buy,"This product is an excellent buy. It was purchased as a gift, and I was pleasantly surprised by its durability and quality."
5,Great board,Great dart board. Very nice and heavy duty. I have never had a dart fall out yet and have played every night for the last 3 weeks.
2,I have to play Negative Nelly. This bites!,"I was so excited after reading all these reviews. A $22 great board. Well, the good thing about the board is just that, the board. It's made of good material and heals nicely. The metal is way to thick which encourages bounce backs, the color of the numbers are nearly unrecognizable. That's no big deal, I painted mine white. There was about 1/16 th inch gap between metal and board which ridiculous. It can't simply be re-anchored....because... It was all warped and so something was inevitable to be ""off"". I gently removed it and took a picture. If I had to do again, I would probably buy the same board. Obviously, I'm one of the unfortunate. Oh, mounting instructions would have helped. 3 nails a few screws and some bracket I had to figure out."
4,Works fine,"A sturdy product. We've used it for a while.The metal frame above the dartboard is somewhere disturbing. Sometimes we throw darts on to it, and the darts drop off.The darts are of low quality. One was broken when it arrived, and another has already been broken."
5,Perfect,"Worth the money to get the perfect/ageless dartboard. Just buy some good plastic tipped darts too & all set to go. Only complaint, would have been nice for it to come with a hanger attached, or at least one included to attach."
4,Good for the price,"I'm not really sure what it meant about darts not bouncing off as much, they bounce off pretty often for me.But that being said, I'm glad I bought it. The darts are pretty decent quality and for the price, I have a decent dartboard that's fun to play."
3,Many Bounceouts,Board is nice Bristle Quality very goodbut there are a lot of bounceoutsnot sure if it is the wires or something elsestill a VERY NICE BOARD
5,Perfect Quality Dartboard,"I was lucky enough to grab this dart board at a price I couldn't refuse. For the price, this is an exceptional board. I would pay upwards of 50 bucks because I feel this one is the same as any other dart board. definitely worth the buy."
3,"Ok toy, but not much to do with it.","We bought several of these Christmas Cabbage Patch dolls, and they sat on the dresser for a few months. When we brought them down to play with, first thing to go was the shoes, and I still find them at the bottom of the toybox. My daughter was 3 when she got them, so we just undressed them, and they went back into the toybox. We really didn't play with them too much."
2,1.5 stars- Not my cup of tea,"I was really excited to get this after reading the many five star reviews but I just listened to it and it doesn't really rock out. I thought that it would be more like prog-metal but it's just sounds really trippy and not metal at all. I don't like the way the vocalist sings and the songs just sound dumb. The cd has very good to great sound quality, even better than groups that are far more popular, but that doesn't redeem the album from being a real stinker. I just listened to their album THE END IS BEGUN, and it's a little better, but this group just isn't my cup of tea. This could be up the alleys of some Amazon customers, just not mine. Cannot recommend!!!"
4,Ormandy conducts Rachmaninov and Stravinsky,"This is a well produced video of Ormandy conducting ""his"" Philadelphia Orchestra in the last few years of his long tenure. Fine performances, and there is a good balance between images of the conductor and the various soloists within the orchestra.For students of conducting, Ormandy is interesting to watch. To the casual observer, he doesn't seem to be doing much - the orchestra KNOWS exactly what he wants. Yet how quickly he sorts problems out in the few moments where things begin to stray. Further, the fact that the players watch him like a hawk throughout is a sure sign that, whilst these performances have been carefully prepared by people attuned to each other, they are certainly not playing on auto-pilot.As a bonus, there is a brief clip of an interview with Ormandy where he discusses Rachmaninov's connections to the Philadelphia Orchestra.In short, great orchestra, fine performances with good video and sound."
4,A must have for mage revised storytellers.,"This book contains a lot of the material that didn't make the cut into Mage Revised. Including rules for Wonder creation and description of the modern day disparate groups.You learn the rules for creating all manner of artifacts from simple prime batteries to more powerfull talismans that carry a bit of your mages soul with them.Reasons for why the Wu Lung, the Templars, and the Solificati joined as a subsections for other traditions are explained.Overall I consider this book a strong buy. especiall if you liked Mage Revised."
3,A good supplement for Mage Revised,"The storyteller's companion is a compilation of all the material that got cut out of the Mage Revised sourcebook. It contains a timeline of mage history, a section on Umbrood, and how to make magical items. There is even a bonus section on disparate crafts and a handy storyteller screen. This book served to make Mage Revised feel more complete. I would recommend it simply for the quick reference screen and the section on how to make magical items."
4,Useful Rules and Information,"This book contains some lesser information, not of earth shattering importance, but still important. Mainly information on crafts.A key thing in this book is it goes over every type of wonder! I didn't even know of many of these things until I read this book and learned about them. It gives very good examples of how wonders are made, and even brings up the idea of giving them merits and flaws of their own.Besides the cover, this book is actually very good though some of the Wonder information deserved it's own book."
5,Its a companion,"Sure, you can do without them, bu you could surely use the help and the screen is cool and useful."
4,HP TC 1100 Pressure Pen works fine - but costs $50,"This pen or stylus is for writing on the HP TC100 tablet pc screen. You can't write on the screen without it, so get an extra. I lost mine and had to go two weeks before getting a replacement because I was out of the country. Then, you have to use just the keyboard. Pictures are on the hp.com website."
5,an book that treats the subject with the depth it deserves,"Greene's book draws on many disciplines to explain a whole fabric of history, design, and construction. It explains how and why furniture of the period came to be as it is. The design and construction of the furniture is presented in the context of the time it was made. It illustrates and explains the construction through representative examples. It shouldn't be confused with ""how-to"" books of measured drawings."
5,What I was looking for,"This is exactly what I was looking for -- good, clean and clear images of how a piece is constructed. Shows evolution of various joints. I liked the geographical breakdown between the regions."
4,Really entertaining and well acted independent Thriller!,"Enjoyed this well crafted movie with wonderful performances by the whole cast -- especially Mark Pellegrino, Alicia Witt, and Tom Guiry. Engaging dramatic thriller for an adult audience. This movie is definitely worth checking out! Would agree #JointBody is a winner."
3,A scientific companion to Genesis,"I started this book very interested in learning news things yet hidden to me in the bible, seen from a scientific perspective. After getting so entangled in all the observations and exegesis of the sacred texts, I thought to myself if I really cared if it was older or younger (how much older or younger?); I mean, if I cared enough to keep reading till the end. I admit I failed to keep my interest alive in this discussion. Whatever the age of the world is, if the Spirit of God didn't make it more clear for us to know, it's quite understandable nobody else would.However, the book may be a great book, if you are interested enough in the subject. To me, it wasn't the most exciting book I ever read."
4,"Good read, could have used a bit more muscle","Snoke is a capable scientist with a very capable grasp of scripture and theology. Actaully, I felt that the science was a bit lacking and he could have expanded his scientific defense of an old-earth. He seems to anticipate more criticism on his biblical hermeneutic than his science - maybe he's right in that. Still, I would have appreciated a deeper treatement of old-earth science."
1,Came apart after minimal use,"Not made well. Mine lives in my van, for camping trips, rarely used. After 3-4 uses, the orange cord cover detached from the plug end, and yes, I pull on the plug, not the cord. The wires are still attached to the plug and it still works, but there are white insulation fibers from inside the cord that have pulled out from the cord end, making the end look like it has doll hair. Though it still works and looks new, it can't be safe and I'm looking for a different brand."
3,Not a Bad Quick Ref.,"This is a very 'no frills' quick reference for the basics that you need to know for your cardiac anesthesia rotation. Dont expect answers to the ""pimp"" questions in this book just the ""need to knows"" to get things done.Not bad, but not a true reference like Kaplan or Hensley. What it does allow is popping into your bookbag and taking it with you."
5,first printing fo a useful book,"this is the original printing of dan carlinsky's book, which is a great practical way to build familiarity and knowledge of the Bible. geared to all levels of reader. hundreds of questions, games and puzzles."
3,Tuneful peek at Gregson's beginnings,"Clive Gregson started his career by writing great Elvis Costello-influenced pop songs and this disc features quite a few of them. The problem is that Any Trouble was influenced by Elvis Costello in the same way an avalanche is influenced by tumbling rocks. As the old adages go: imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and flattery will get you nowhere."
4,Top Tunes That Will Keep You Humming,"What can I say?Any Trouble's 'Where Are All The Nice Girls' contains everything that anyone could ever need in one album. The contrast of up-beat, catchy pop songs against the soulful, insightful lyrics of Clive Gregson's ballads will just keep you singing along all day.Some class playing, fine lyrics and above all, full of heart. This album was made with real dedication. Well done boys!Mark McDee"
1,High Limb Chain Saw.,"I had no problem getting the saw into postion, but once there it had a tendancy to flip over if I wasn't careful, and then eventually get stuck in its own cut. The learning curve is quite long with this tool, and at its best it works poorly. I found myself using the saw to cut into my branches a couple of inches (until the saw got stuck beyond removal) then I used a long rope and my car to pull at the branches to force them to the ground. If you are dealing with large branches, and are desperate, it is worth a shot."
3,Rope style chain saw,"Circumstatially handy... Not very useful in and of itself for limbs above 20' and limbs having smaller diameters. Smaller limb diameter encourages the chain to catch or bind in the cut. That said, I have made quick and safe work of two five inch thick limbs at 20-25' in height. Decent tool. Do not ignore instructions."
3,Great......but,"The saw worked great for the first two times I used it. At one point however it became stuck (not unusual) and upon freeing it, the clamps that held the loop, which it turn held the chain, loosened and broke. I had to put a new clamp on and am back in business. I think these clamps should be stronger since there is a lot of pressure on them as they are pulled over the limb. Other than that It is a pleasure to use the straps that come with it give much comfort to your hands as you cut through larger limbs."
4,Worth the money but could be improved,"The Rope and Chain Saw did the job and was worth the money. It took a little practice to toss the bag,but it was like a carnival game with no bear prize for getting it over the limb. They could have charged another dollar and put a better clip on the toss bag, it broke on the first toss. I suggest not using the clip provided but take the one off you water bottle that you use to clip it to your belt and use it. I can also see that in not too much time the rope will break. The only problem we had was on a broken branch the chain would not flip over so the saw teeth could cut. Someone should invent a chain saw that has teeth all the way around to avoid this problem."
3,High Limb CS48 Chain Saw,"I received the product promptly thank you.The product does work as stated but it is not an easy task to cut branches that are 3"" or thicker.Also if you have never cutoff upper branches a word of advise make sure that you tie off the branch that you are cutting."
5,Rope Chain pretty decent,"I was surprised on how well this worked. I've only used it on small limbs, maybe about 3-4 inches in diameter, but it does a great job, especially if you would rather not have to climb a ladder to do any pruning. I'm gonna test it out on a much bigger limb eventually, will let everyone know how that goes"
1,"chain too light, twists along its length and won't cut","I did not have a good result with this saw.I tried to cut a 3"" limb about 20 feet above the ground.The chain was so flimsy that, even though the one end is weighted so the teeth face down at that one end, the chain itself twists along its length so that just the side of the chain rubs on the branch without actually cutting any wood.After bring the saw down on the ground, I held the 48"" long chain stretched out between my hands and found that it easily twisted 180 degrees along its length with a very light twist of my hands. This product needs a more substantial chain so that it does not twist, and it would also help to just put cutting teeth on both sides of the chain, in addition to orienting the cutting teeth in both forward and backwards directions, and also a sideways direction if that is possible."
2,Factory rope crimp fittings failed on first use,"I had a high limb with a very difficult throw but managed to get the rope over the limb. In the proceess of cutting first ther crimp fitting on the end of the rope where I attached extra rope and where the tossing bag goes failed...had to retie and retoss it over a difficult limb. afet getting it on the limb the second time and got to cutting, about 1/3 of the way though a 8 inch limb the ropes crimp fitting at the end of the blade failed!! I pulled it down and also noticed the crimp fitting on the other end of the chain was about to fail too. Packaged it up and returned it for a refund.My advice if you are going to use this on anything but a small branch with any easy throw to reach it is to redo the ropes at all the ends where the cheap, weak, factory crimp fittings are but better advice would be not to buy it."
3,"Worked on first branch, but now won't stay tooth side down","Once you get the weight thrown over the branch you want to lop off, then it's easy... IF the chain part stays teeth-side down. On the second branch I tried, I could not get it to do that... the cutting side was up, away from the branch. And the little weight that's supposed to make it go cutting side down just isn't up to the task. So it's just the luck of the draw whether this thing works or not. It should have teeth on BOTH sides of the chain... that way there'd be no question of it cutting through the limb. Time for a re-design."
3,Great idea; fair execution,"Having used this thing to remove a couple of branches, I now know some modifications i need to make to it. The first is to replace the kinky ski rope poly stuff with proper hard rope, so that twist can be controlled. the other is to add some wright to the little righting tab, which is close to useless because it is so light. As it is, making the necessary undercut to avoid hangers is close to impossible. But after modification, it should be a highly useful tool."
5,Worth the purchase.,"Initially when I was looking for one of these, I made a big mistake buy trying to go cheap and buy the $15 one from Harbour Freight. Don't make the same mistake I did; buy this one. It works as advertised and did just what I wanted it for. It is well built and you actually get what you order."
1,Junk - stay away,"On the 1st try the key snap for the throw weight deformed out of shapeOn the 2nd try the end of the rope pulled out of the metal sleeveOn subsequent tries the chain without fail got stuck in the branch to be removed, necessitating a climb up a ladder.Don't even think about buying this product; mine's going back for a refund."
3,Did work but!!,After making a couple of cuts I experienced the following- It is difficult to through the weight bag over the proper limb when the tree has thicker (bushy) small limbs present. The weight bag has a very chinsy snap attachment - it broke right away when retrieving a misguided through. The chain seems to be very light and gets stuck often. If the chain were to get badly stuck I am sure someting would brake if a lot of pull is applied. It was nice to bring down a couple high branches but I know it will take a lot of work to complete my pruning needs.
1,CS-48 rope and chain saw,"Like I said before this is the worst product I've purchased on Amazon.com, it broke the first time I used it on a 3"" branch. I would not recommend it to anyone, very cheaply made, rope is weak and throwing bag broke on third throw. Also for price very expensive product for quality."
4,Worth Every Penny,"I cut down a 80 foot tall oak tree that was in a very tight space with this saw. I was able to limb the tree down to about 30 feet high and then used a gas chain saw to finish. The quote to take this tree down from a professional was $600. It took me 4 hours and a lot of elbow grease but I saved a bundle and the saw is barely broken in.A tip that will save you time and frustration - as soon as you open the package, throw away the rope and use 1/8"" uncoated aircraft cable in its place - trust me on this!"
4,saw works quite well,I used the rope saw on a few dead branches and it worked fine. It can be a bit tricky though to get the chain right-side-up over the branch. But after a few attempts it worked. So far so good and certainly cheaper than a tree removal service.
4,Environment Friendly Chain Saw,"My husband loved his environmental friendly, hand operated high limb chain saw. More people should discover this product. It does take a little practice to work it right and to get proficient with it, but worth every minute. Plus it is so much safer then climbing a ladder and using a chain saw while up high in a tree. No need to be a professional landscaper for this product. We have found many uses for it. This product comes highly reccomended by this family of nature lovers."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! This 48"" high limb chain saw worked well on three 3"" cuts. It worked so-so on one 8"" cut (kept getting stuck). After that, it just wouldn't work. It keeps getting stuck. You have to have a tall ladder nearby to get up there and get it unstuck and it seems to be duller than a butter knife. Save yourself some money, lots of time, and an enormous amount of frustration, and get either a chain saw or a motorized pole saw. This thing is NOT worth it!"
1,Trouble flipping chain to saw side,Worked well on the first limb. Tried for 45 minutes to get the chain flipped to the saw side but to no avail.
1,Don't Buy!,"Inferior piece of crap!Waste of money and time.It broke first timeout.How??!!The clamp that ties or connects the rope to the ""saw tooth"" let go on my first try.The rope is made of weak material and the clamps that connect the blade are made of cheap materials.I'm a glass is half full kind of guy. Always looking for the positive in life.This ""rope and chain saw"" is $50.00 now you see it now you don't!"
2,I really wanted this to work...,"I'm willing to accept that maybe my expectations were unreasonable, but here are the issues. The weight wasn't heavy enough to pull the rope down the other side of the limb. I removed it and added a heavier (3 lb) weight, which made it really difficult to throw, but I got it in the right spot. But the saw wouldn't make a dent in the branch, which admittedly was quite thick. I tried again on some smaller branches, same problem. In theory it should work, and I'm sure others were successful, but for my end...it couldn't do the job."
2,counter productive product,"The chain is sharp and actually cuts but you would need infinite patience to actually get it over a high limb and work the handles back and forth to be effective. If it lands cutting size down, that's a bonus if not a necessity. Otherwise, you have to extricate it from the tree and start all over again hoping it doesn't get snagged on a branch. In the case wher you don't have a ladder or a ladder high enough, it might be useful. But those are the actual situations that make it extremely difficult to use!!"
2,Rope Broke,"I bought this to cut some high limbs and perhaps the top off a difficult to access tree. I managed to cut almost all the way through a one 3"" limb before the rope broke off one end of the chain. Pulling on the other end only caused it to dig into the wood and get permanently stuck."
3,Expensive for what it is,"First off, this is a very frustrating piece of equipment to use. Second, you will cuss your way to Hell and back using it. Third, its very frustrating to use. I bought this to cut 4 high limbs (60-70') to make way for a swing. It eventually worked for three of them, but on the last one it got stuck about 1/3 of the way through the limb. I was able to break the weakened limb with a rope but the chain stayed and remains stuck 65' up in the tree. So if you can handle some aggravation and nothing else will work, then this tool might be of some use. It is also quite expensive for what amounts to a chainsaw chain with opposing teeth."
2,too many $ $,"nice idea, but not easy to use. binds and then climb the tree anyway. not worth the $ $ ."
4,Rope and chain saw,"Came in a small package but well wrapped. Pretty much as descried, only used it once so far and it did the jobadequately if a little awkward to use. As the branch was reasonably high it was not possible to cut the under side at all so it eventually broke off leaving a bit sticking out. however it is handy for those branches you just can't reach any other way and saves the risk of being up a ladder trying to use chain saw with both hands while balancing!"
3,Somewhat useful,Tends to get pinched in cut after 75% thru the cut.Loops on end of ropes need to be alot stronger.
2,High Limb CS-48 Rope-and-Chain Saw,"The concept of the cutting chain with a rope pull on either side is a very good idea, but it is difficult to postition the cutting edge of the chain to the branch to be cut. In addition, the clamps holding the rope to the cutting chain let loose during operation. After replacing the clamps the unit worked better."
2,Chain saw?,Haven't given up on it yet but have not had much success with cutting any limbs yet. If the limb is high it's very difficult to get the chain over it without any stray branches getting in the way and in the correct position. Slingshot was no help and my throwing arm isn't what it used to be.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this tool to trim some dead 3-inch diameter ash branches about 20 ft. up. It's not like I never trimmed a tree before--I spend a summer working as a tree trimmer while in college. However, this tool doomed the operation from the start.First the bean bag used to throw the rope over the limb got stuck. When I pulled it back, it ripped open, losing the sand and ruining the bag. The two of us used a padlock for a substitute weight and got the rope and chain over the first limb. During the early stages of sawing one of the red handles broke. Then the chain refused to saw further, wedging itself in the saw cut.I now have two pretty yellow ropes hanging from my tree, with a stuck chain, and no prospects in ever getting it down without calling the pros and their boom truck.Although the chain itself seemed to be of reasonable quality, the rest of this product was made with poor quality materials."
4,great for limbs out of reach of pole saw,"I found the saw easy to use, but had some problems getting the rope over limbs. I ended up using strong string attached to the bean bag to get over the limb, and then tying the rope from the saw to the end of the string.The best way to cut seems to be to first run the saw on one side a few times, then saw from the other side a few times, and finally saw from directly beneath the limb.I worked alone, but it would go much faster if two worked together from each side of the limb.I couldn't successfully cut some limbs because the leaves made it too difficult to get the rope off. However, I should be able to complete the job once the leaves fall from the tree."
4,Rope chain saw works well,"This rope chain saw works well. I do notice that this 48-inch chain model tends to kink a little more than the shorter-chain model. I would also recommend trying to cut your tree on a dry day. It seems to me that the wood swells up on a humid day, and the saw can stick a bit."
3,"better than paying someone, but not easy to use","I had a tough time with this saw on larger branches. It got stuck a lot, which led to me pulling very hard, which in turn led to the metal D ring that holds the handle on the rope bending apart. Still, this is the only solution for cutting high branches that I have found so far. But I can't recommend it. I returned mine."
4,High :Limb Chain Saw,"I have used this saw a couple of time. It works very well. There are a couple of short comings. I would recommend using a bow & arrow in order to get one side of the rope over the limb you want to cut. Using the bean bag is not as easy as it seems. There is also a knack to get the chain set right to cut. Directions say to undercut the branch you want to cut. This would be easier with two people. I find that when one person use it, the chain gets caught in the bottom of the cut. Then it becomes a hassle to free it. If there are two people the chain would not be able to slide back up into the under cut."
1,High Limb CS-48 Rope-and-Chain Saw,"The chain saw is great. The weighted bag is a great idea. The small clip holding the bag is cheap. Clip came undone while throwing over tree limb. Also, rope broke while cutting limb. After market rope and d-ring will make it a better product."
3,Cutting difficult,"Rope saw was able to be placed on the target branch after several tries with the bean bag. Problems came with the cutting edge on the branch side. The cutting blade turned up side down, this had to be readjusted (reversed toward the branch). A cutting blade could be placed along the other side giving a double cutting edge with out the need for flipping."
4,"Good product,with some minor adjustments","The CS-48 High Limb saw worked well once I made some simple alterations.Thanks to the previous user comments, I replaced the wire factory rings that are to weak and come apart when pulling,I also replaced the ropes with stronger and longer ones.I was able to add weight to the small tab that keeps the saw in a downward position by drilling and adding a nut and bolt near the end of the tab,I used larger rings to hold the rope,this will stop the rope from getting pulled into the cut.Make sure you buy the 48"" model for larger limbs,(also works great on small limbs).We were able to cut a 12"" branch in about 15 min.It does take two people to cut larger branches.As stated in earlier comments,the hard part is getting the line over the branches,good luck.P.S. don't forget to oil the chain for smoother operation."
1,Not useful - avoid this tool,"Product is nicely made and some aspects are well thought out. The throw bag works well (though the clip has to be reshaped every time as it bends). The hand straps work very well for working the rope. However, the whole idea falls down due to the chain. Despite design attempts to keep the cutting edge of the chain pointed to the tree (there is a metal piece that you are supposed hold between the ropes to prevent this) the chain always rolls and the teeth only fan air. Since the metal piece is at best 6 inches long any limb exceeding 4 inches and you can't effectively engage the guide. I will go back to using a pole saw and ladder - that works every time."
1,directions?,this did not work I would not recommendbetter directions need to be provideda waste of moneyvery difficult to fliip the blade when trying to remove the limb
3,"Good idea, but could be better.","I bought this to remove some limbs that were just about at the maximum diameter this thing could handle. While everything looked great out of the box, once it was put to use it was quickly realized that the nylon rope is not the best choice for this. When you get the rope saw situated on the branch and begin cutting into it, you're going to get stuck a few times. The nylon rope stretches a bit as you try and force your way through the snag, and that's when you start wondering if the rope is going to snap and whether the segment of chain saw is going to stay stuck in the limb or come flying out. So, unless you're going to be using this product for smaller branches, you may consider replacing the nylon rope with a different type."
3,Could be better,"Generally speaking it worked well and I accomplished the task that it was purchased for. The problem I had was in getting the chain oriented so that teeth of the chain were against the limb. There is a small metal plate attached at one end of the chain that I assume is there for that purpose, but it seems it is too small or light to function well. A more substancial piece would likely work better. I'll add more weight to the end of the plate before I use the saw again, and I will because it does get the job done."
3,OK.....,The saw worked ok. I got the limb down I wanted to. It is very flimsy at the connection point of the throwing bag. Had to replace ring with mechanic's wire. The pull handles came apart on the first pull. Took several tries before the actuator worked.
4,Paducah Ice Storm 2009,"I bought this 48"" rope saw after Paducah, KY had a major ice storm Jan 2009. We used the rope saw on 3 branches so far. Each branch measured about 6"" diameter (oak). Our experience is that it takes about 15 minutes to put the saw into the correct position, then 2-3 minutes to saw through the branch. The chain has a weighted bar attached to one end that should position the cutting side of the chain towards the branch. It still takes some patience to get the cutting side correctly on the wood. We used the two-man method when cutting, trying to keep the ropes as horizontal as possible. This keeps the chain from pinching as the branch breaks away. It also keeps you from being under the limb. Also, as others have said, make two cuts. Make the first away from the trunk because the first cut will split the branch as the branch breaks away. Then the second cut can be closer to the trunk to neaten the cut. We just tied the rope to the handles and skipped the cheap clips."
2,high rope saw,The high rope saw can be difficult to use. It doesn't always stay cutting edge down so you have to throw the saw back up to change which side is down(Only one side of the blade cuts). It binds frequently and sometimes gets stuck. Make sure you read the directons and udercut the branch or the bark will tear. It is difficult to use by yourself if the branch is more than 3 inches in diamater. It bent and had to be thrown our after using it on about 15 branches.
4,Happy with purchase,Purchased this saw a week ago and was able to use it this weekend. We are very happy with this product. It works best with two people and patience. We are working to clear dead and some live branches from our fir trees. The few we have done look so much better.Like other reviews the clip for the weight bag is flimsy. We just made a wire loop out of some heavy electrical wire and if it gets stuck it will just straighten out (with a lot of pulling).This product works great and saves money.
4,cut it,This is a good product. I did get the throwing bag wrapped around a limb and had to devise another method to get the rope over that limb to retrieve the bag. I bought some other rope to extend the ropes to cut higher limbs. Also I bought thinner line to get the throwing bag to higher limbs. It works great though once you get it working for you.
2,Hard to use,After the early October snow storm this year I bought the High Limb Rope and Chain Saw to try to get down some of the hanging branches that were left around my property. I picked an easy branch to start on but found that the Rope Saw was hard to use. If the branch is high up it takes many tries to get the chain over the branch and in the right orientation. When I finally started sawing the chain was working well and cutting through the branch but then got stuck. We even had two people doing the sawing (which helps the angle) but the chain still got stuck. We had to get a ladder to get the chain down. If you have a tall ladder it is easier just to use that and it really can reach just as high as the rope saw. So when the rope saw works it's nice to have but I've found it frequently hard to use.
1,Waste of Money,"This product does not work. It is a total Waste of money. The rope that came with it is cheap and breaks. The hook that attaches the sand bag is cheap and bent out of shape. Save your money, buy a trim pole instead."
2,"Good for comic relief, not so much for cutting","I might have to re-review this tool if I ever cut anything with it, but so far I have been unsuccessful.Amazon suggests other people have bought a slingshot with this tool, which I assumed was used to shoot the weighted bag over the limb. Save your money...the slingshot is not nearly powerful enough to send this bag more than a few feet, especially when weighed down by the rope and saw. Throwing the bag by hand is more effective.When throwing the bag, be sure not to catch the metal hook on your finger, or it will cut you.After several attempts at throwing the bag over a 40 ft high limb, I instead got the weighted bag and rope wrapped around a limb of a different tree, and couldn't get it loose. I ended up just cutting both trees down with a chainsaw to be done with it.It seems like a good idea in theory, but it didn't work out for me."
4,Does a good job if used with a bit of practice and care,Works quite well- not as precise as a regular chainsaw but much safer than climbing into a tree to carry out limb removal. Takes some patience to thread the weighted end of the rope into cutting position. Works really well with two people especially if you are tackling larger branches. Keep the chain sharpened and oiled and you should be fine.
3,"Did a few cuts, but....",Unless the branch in question is nearly horizontal the saw keeps flipping over to it's non-sawing side despite the flimsy weight tab. Instead of a section of chainsaw blade I would recommend some aggressively toothed wire saw which could cut from any angle.
1,"Good concept, poor execution","Had I known this was a little more than a section of chain-saw blade attached to a rope, I probably would have made my own. It was all but impossible to have the chain ""roll over"" so that the blade was next to the limb and not the back of it..."

3,Target,"You can get most of the Cars toys at Target for $3.50. I have seen them at all prices online, and then I went to Target and bought Doc, The King, Hudson Hornet, Ramone, Lightning, Sarge and a few more for $3.50 each."
4,Exactly what our 3yo wanted,"This is the size of a Matchbox car (some of the ""Cars"" cars we've bought on Amazon were a smaller scale) and is exactly what our 3yo had been asking for. The tail fin is made of plastic, but it's a high quality plastic and the rest of the car is a high quality die cast metal that feels as solid as any other Matchbox-style car I've seen (and we have lots of them around, including a box left over from my own childhood)."

5,Great quality.excellent price,Nice prewashed feel...excellent craftsmanship...I did buy a slightly larger size than my son wears so he could wear them over jeans...this worked out well...Nice price and fast delivery....can't compete with driving to 10 stores for best price and in stock size...would buy again if the need arose
3,The Copy I Received Was Defective,"I had previously seen this documentary on TV and enjoyed it thoroughly which is what prompted me to buy it as a gift for someone who is a big Gregory Peck fan. A while later, however, I found out that the DVD was actually defective and would not play at all! Unfortunately, I received this news too late to orchestrate a return (the return window had closed). So, if you do choose to purchase this product (which happens to be a very enjoyable look into the life of a great actor), I would encourage you to try out the DVD soon after you receive it, in case you encounter the same problem."
4,"Yes, it's a great book but it's nearly 12 years old!","_Never Buy Anything New_ was my shopping bible for several years in the mid-90s.

4,DON MCLEAN The Voice -The Music -The Concert,"1992.I have had this Don McLean concert video in my personal collection ever since it first came out, about 15 years ago, and it has endured as one of the ""most watched"" that I own, largely in part simply due to itsexcellent choice of songs, all sounding quite nice to the ear, Dons vocals backed up by a very rocking little band who themselves put out quite a good sound, too. Lighting is fine, as is the sound quality. An enthusiastic audience,in addition to Dons witty remarks here and there,round things out to make for one very enjoyable concert evening on tape.Filmed in Color, the tape length is 77 minutes. The songs: Everyday, Love in my Heart, Orphans of Wealth, Seaman, Castles in the Air, And I Love You so, Supermans Ghost, Prime Time, 1967, Headroom, Dreidle, Crying,American Pie, Infinity, Stardust,(and my all time favorite) Vincent."

5,"Cat who hated wet food, loves it!","I don't see how anyone couldn't like this food. Our cat, a male about seven years old, hated any canned food. This is the only one he will touch! Our new kitten loves it also--she is about a year old. She eats a can per day. She was undernourished and had been viciously attacked out in the wild and on top of that had had a litter of kittens, even though she was still a kitten herself. This food has helped her so much. She is bright eyed and plays and looks like a different cat since we started her on this."
5,One of kitty's favorites,"Recently, I got as many varieties of Merrick's for my cat to try as I could. I got them from my local PetCo, not Amazon. I usually feed him a custom raw chicken diet, but for travel or when friends are taking care of him that isn't practical. I used to use Wellness CORE dry and wet cat food but it was just getting too expensive. I was pleased when I found Merrick's, and love that it is made in Texas (my native state!).I do recommend researching how to switch your cat's food safely to avoid any possible digestive system issues such as diarrhea or vomiting.My cat really liked the Ocean Breeze food. I mixed this with the Wellness CORE to get him adjusted and he licked all the wet food off of the kibbles before starting on the kibble.I rate Merrick's Ocean Breeze five stars. It is made here in Texas, and with real quality ingredients, I can feel good knowing my cat isn't eating meat flavored corn and wheat!"
4,The Hebrew vocabulary of the Old Testament,"The editor says the the purpose of this dictionary is to analyze the religious statements of the Old Testament with the aid of all accessible resources and the present them in their peculiarity, in order to shed as much light as possible on the connections of the content of Old Testament though in a given text, tradition, or institution. To accomplish this goal 39 international Old Testament scholars have written articles on 53 Hebrew words found in the Old Testament, ranging from the word for ""father"" to that for ""alone."" There are articles on ""light, ""man,"" ""God,"" ""land,"" among others. While the words are arranged according to their Hebrew form, all Hebrew words are transliterated. This is the first of several volumes translated from the German original."

3,Quirky but not that funny,"I had never read Grizzard's work before this book, but when I read the description and reviews I imagined that it would be akin to Bill Bryson, with wry humor and interesting, witty observations. I may have smiled a couple of times, but largely I was just confused. The cultural references were so obscure that I was completely lost half of the time, even though I am fairly well-read and knowledgeable about history and world events. And the other half of the time, I could tell he was trying to be funny but, well, he just *wasn't.* The stories felt disjointed and aimless. Meh."
5,Laughs and tears,"This was my introduction to Lewis Grizzard, and I found this book full of essays that warm the heart. I especially liked the columns about railroads since my own childhood was full of trains. Lewis's thoughts about love also were well worth reading, and some of the obit pieces were enough to bring tears to my eyes."
2,Disappointed,I found this book to be disappointing. From the discription I expected to laugh out loud alot. I didn't. I will say the chapter on what he learned from his mother is good advise though.
3,Not what I was expecting,"I enjoyed reading this book. But I strongly agree with one of the other reviewers that the title to the book is misleading. I expected the book to be a quest on the part of the author to tag and release a marlin weighing more than 1,000 pounds. Instead, it is a collection of the author's stories of fishing tournaments and boat deliveries with bluewater fishing mixed in with the delivery. There are a few tales of grander marlin mixed in.The book reads almost like one is reading Mr. Elias' journal.Hard core billfish anglers like myself will enjoy this book, but I would not expect it to have appeal beyond this group."
4,Hood Pins,"I bought these for a project car. They do seem to be very well worth the money i paid for them. I am very excited to use them. Good product, buy them!"
4,Sex!!! Lies!!!! and Video!!!!!,"Sex!!! Lies!!!! and Video!!!!! What a mix! Mister Mann Frisby has done a wonderful job on this novel. It is packed with suspense, excitment , humor and was just a down right page turner. This is sure to be a hit.Reviewed by Nakea Murray Of AsThePageTurns Book Club"
5,Crazy people..Hot scenes,"I picked this book up off the clearance rack at the bookstore. I was hooked from the first few pages. I found it to be a busy book because it was always something happening from chapter to chapter. I found it interesting that cuz' never had a name (I guess that's what they do in the hood call everybody cuz'). Cuz' finally came to his senses and realized that money wasn't everything and that usually how you start (when doing things wrong) is how you end up. Meeting Onyx was the best thing for him because he needed somebody he could trust besides his mom however Onyx wasn't a dummy either even tho' her feeling had deepen she knew that wasn't the way she wanted to live her life on the run. This is a good quick read about friendship, trust and love."
1,How dare you folks compare this man's work to Donald Goines,"This book is garbage. I wish I could have given it a half of a star. I am so glad I only paid $1 for this book from a used book sale. I read the other reviews and I'm sure no one over 25 would give this book more than one star. People, do yourself a favor and read Eric J Dickey, E. Lynn Harris,Walter Mosley, Mary Monroe, just to name a few real authors! If you are looking for an exciting street novel, read Iceberg Slims books. His and D. Goines books can be found on amazon or holloway house publishing co. website."
5,This book is a must read,"I absolutely loved the book. It had the local Philadelphia vibe that I was familiar to. The reader can really relate to the characters, because they're either people that you know, members of your family or it may even remind you a little of yourself.The book was a page turner from the first chapter. Once you pick it up you won't want to put it down. I'm personally waiting for the sequel to see what happens next in the lives of the characters. If you've read ""True to the Game"",then you'll love ""Blinking Red Light."""
4,Green Light on Blinking Red Light,This was a great street novel with a story that will amaze you.This reminded me of an up to date Donald Goines type tale.Mister Mann Frisby did an excellent job.
5,BOOK OF THE YEAR,"This book was good from the first page until the last. I loved this book and was fast pace and not a dull moment. I cannot wait for Mister Mann Frisby's next book. I have recommened this book to several people. When I was at the Odunde celebration in Philadelphia and saw his stand, I was telling people to purchase the book. THIS IS DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE!!!"
4,RED LIGHT. STOP AND READ!,THIS BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD. THE FIRST PAGE WAS AN ATTENTION GRAB! I LOVE WHEN I OPEN A BOOK AND THE FIRST PAGE CAN DRAW YOU IN!
4,Roller Coaster,"This book took more twist and turn than the ""Cork Screw"". VERY CLEVER how the main character's name was never revealed yet you felt like you totally knew him. I certainly felt like I was watching a movie it was so fast paced. The teasers at the end of each chapter kept the when,where,what and how's in motion causing me to keep reading into the wee hours of the night. Dex was a slimey snake, who teaches you that you have to watch your back & your women. Those that are close to you can be the very ones to bring you down. I was a little disappointed with the ending. I like drama so I wanted drama, but it's cool. There was plenty of it throughout. Just like a roller coaster,going through twist and turns for 90 seconds and then it's over and my thoughts are I WANTED MORE! Mister Mann Frisby, pat yourself on the back for a great first novel. The sneak preview of WIFE BEATER had me drooling for another roller coaster ride."
5,Blinking Red Light,"Blinking Red Light was a surprising treat. I found myself caught up in a fast-paced psychological, emotional and physical chase -- a real roller coaster ride. The reader doesn't get to blink because you're caught up in the frenzy.BJ Stevens, Author of ""Singing Soprano.""Summer 2002"
5,Blinking Red Light,A friend of mind went into the Tower Book Store and purchased Blinking Red Light for herself and allowed me to read it first. When I opened up the book and read the first two pages I was hooked. The story was so amazing that I just could not put it down. May I give you a round of applause Mister Mann Frisby for writing such an EXCELLENT book. It is the perfect example of how a good guy with one bad friend can completely turn your life around. I truly feel that any person who has grown up in Philly can relate to the book. I advise anyone who reads this review to puchase the book. Believe me it will be money well spent. Once again thank you for such a great story. I can hardly wait until the release of your next book. Until your next book is released peace be with you.
5,"Awesome lens, but....","everything about this lens is awesome. if you are thinking about it for your kit, it is clean, crisp, and well made. however, don't buy the lens on its own, it's cheaper to buy it as part of the DMC-L1 bundle!! i don't understand the pricing of this lens as a standalone. right now on amazon the amazing DMC-L1 (which is comparable to the Leica Digilux 3) is available for around 800 bones and comes with this exact lens. i know!!"
2,Extremely disappointing....,"Well, maybe I didn't do myself justice by making this my first Vic Wooten album, but that shouldn't be an issue. I am an avid bassist of over 10 years and I bought this album thinking that I would hear some great jazz with some eccentric bass to it. I was wrong. There is no percussion on this CD, and half of the tracks are 30 second studio outtakes of Vic mumbling about things before he starts playing. He's a great bassist if you like hearing appregios, pops and slaps, muted strings, and finger tapping. I would just love to hear what Vic can do in a band with drums, keyboards, etc. I was disappointed to say the least."
2,Uninspiring,"Ok here's the deal. Victor Wooten is without a doubt one of the world's top bassists today. But simply put, I find this album little more than a novelty. Sure, Victor showcases some amazing chops and great tone throughout the album. However I find I tire of this album easily. His compositions are distinctly ""bass"" compositions, which is not a compliment, even coming from me, a bass player. I could never see a band playing any of them. The best track here is the medley of standards. Another problem with this cd are the annoying radio interludes, leaving you with barely half of the ""real"" tracks you expected. Granted, this is a very interesting album to listen to, but I don't like interesting music. I like passionate music, and I find little of it here. If you want to here some great technical bass playing, buy this album. If you want to here some great music, look elsewhere."
3,Hmmm,"Victor Wooten, I've seen him live. With Bela Fleck. Amazing stuff. Cool jams that he goes into as a soloist occasionally during shows. The album is a collection of those kinds of jams. They're amazing. He's amazing...."
2,"About ""Collecting Fossils""","A very well presented, attractive publication. The range of fossils presented is very limited and many of the examples shown are below average for the type. There are far superior publications available within a similar price range."
3,Not quite comprehensive,"While Mayr took on a monumental task in researching the history of ideas in 3 important areas of biology, this book feels limited. The most glaring weakness I found is the heavy Eurocentrism displayed throughout. It gives no mention to the large contribution made by scientists in Asia to many of the issues it addresses. The book also feels highly repetitive in some areas, explaining the same concepts every few pages at times. I feel that it would have been better served as a series of books, each one more detailed in the branch of biology with which it is concerned."
2,The Globemaster,"The book was apparently written by a flight engineer assigned to the Hamilton AFB 336 MAS in the aircraft's later years. While fairly detailed regarding the aircraft's mechanical systems, it is either in error or otherwise devoid of the bird's flying characteristics, navigation and communication systems. The typical mission from Travis to Vietnam was not typical of anywhere else in the world. As a former navigator, the book was simply wrong regarding flying over Africa, S. America, Antarctica, the northern latitudes, the Atlantic, and most other places in the world. There are many interesting and factual stories to be told, and a lot of former crew members who would be willing to share them."
1,Wasted my money,"I purchased this belt to go with a new dress I purchased. It was exactly the color and style I wanted. The problem is - when I put the belt on and clasped it the clasp would slip out of the hole. It didn't matter which hole in the belt I used, the clasp would always slip right out. I was very disappointed. We tried using a pliers to bend the clasp, but that didn't help. I threw the belt away."
3,"Vic is God, but he needs the Flecktones behind him","As a beginning bass player and a long-time Flecktones fan, I picked up this CD in hopes that it would showcase Victor's unreal bass technique and skills for composing the funky grooves. After listening to it a few times, I decided I got the former, but not really the latter. The layered bass tracks and synth-drum lines were and are technically superb - no one can match Victor for his speed and accuracy, not to mention his soloing abilities. But I was let down by what I think are some weak compositions, and Vic's singing and rapping just aren't up to par with his playing. While there are a few gems in there, some tracks hint at a lameness that drags the album down a bit. I agree that this is a must-have for any bassist's library, just don't expect it to be as musically strong as anything the Flecktones have produced."
3,"Not his best, far from it in fact.","Simply put, if you want to hear Vic at his best, get Show Of Hands. The majority of this album is experimental ""effects"", overdubs, and pure weird. Norwegian Wood is a great song though, could take out the Beatles version in a heartbeat."
3,Too weird.,"Victor is a damn good bassist, but this is just way too bizarre! ""What did he say?"" sounds like it's being sung by a chorus of midgets!This album is just very inconsistent and uneven and it takes away from his skill. The Radio skit is pretty funny though."
2,Talented but overrated,"Gimmicky sounds, like hearing Eddie Van Halen play Eruption for two hours. He butchers jazz standards, Beatles, and Coltrane with equal aplomb. Go check out Gary Willis & Tribal Tech if you want to hear what a modern bassist should sound like.Ironically the best musician in the Flecktones is the pianist/harmonica player Levy; and you never hear anything about him!"
4,Terriffic follow up album,"This is a quality follow up CD to those of you who have not bought ""A Show Of Hands"". Victor is again at the top of his form, and shows a versatility rarely seen in bands across the country. He has continualy been voted ""Best Bass Player of The Year"" by his collegues, and it is a joy to hear him establishing his own following, in addition to us regular Flecktone fans. Get the CD, and if you can, hear him live. And to the music fan from Philly, you're intelligent enough to use the word ""aplomb"", but you're stupid enough not to know that Howard Levy stopped playing with the group in 1993. Nice try, poser. Flecktone fans, you've got to own this album!"
3,Cross Roads for Victor and me,"I am not an expert, I do know what I like. Personally I think Victor is the next best thing since Jaco and Stanley made the scene. Inventive and sometimes outrageous.Well for this album it is a little of a cross between Frank Zappa and Stanley Clarke along with a slice of Victor Wootens Life scape in the little short pieces that he always seems to include on his albums.It isn't my favourite album but it does have some very interesting cuts.Bottom line, I'm luke warm on it, BUT, when I take what I like out of it , there is more than enough to make me smile."
4,A fabulous beginning,"Put simply, this is the best CD I've heard in a long time by the best musician. I find Vic's work to be moving, passionate an' just plain funky. I liked this CD more than ""Show of Hands."" On both of these CD's Victor seems to still be looking for exactly the ""right feel"" and so there is a great deal of variety and the CD comes off a little eclectic. Personally I find some of his best stuff is the funkier grooves (""What did he say?,""I Don't Wanna Cry"" and ""Buzz"") Hopefully, Vic will continue to put out more solo CD's and we'll see where he goes next and what he decides on. Overall, a must for anyone that can appreciate good music (and gets so bored with pop)."
3,Amazing bass player but really weak song construction,"I love bass guitar playing as much as the next guy, but great bass playing without a great song can grow very tiresome. Don't get me wrong, there are a few gems and all of the tracks have some bouts of brilliance, I'll take a jaco pastorius album or a weather report album any day. If you are a diehard bass player and you really don't care about songs per se, then you will love this album. However, i would lean more towards any of victor's brilliant work with bela fleck and the flecktones."
2,"Hate to be a wet blanket, but it's not the best","Yes, yes, I love these pieces by Fauré, too. However, John Georgiadis' conducting is so slow and dirge-like that they lose all their spontaneity and appeal to me. He drags the Prelude to Pelléas & Mélisande out to nearly 7 minutes (6:56) when the delightful old record I'm replacing did it in 5:27. Fortunately he didn't conduct everything on this CD. Now I need to buy another recording - arrgghh!"
1,"Poor CD, boring music","I went looking for music from this composer because of a pretty piece I heard on classical radio recently. This CD was not at all what I'd hoped for. First of all, whoever mixed this did a piss poor job. You have to turn the volume WAY UP just to hear anything. Too much mid level, not much high and no low (bass) at all. One of the poorest audio quality CDs I've heard in awhile. As for the music, most of the pieces selected just aren't really all that interesting. I ended up only liking the piece that originally prompted me to buy this. All around, a very diappointing purchase."
5,Alicia Drake Really Knows What She's Talking About,"I'm impressed. As someone who often shops in Paris, I was amazed that Alicia Drake tells it like it is. Her descriptions of the merchandise at particular stores is dead-on and lively; she's not afraid to call a store overrated (& she's right!) This book makes it easy to plan a shopping trip to Paris since she goes by neighborhoods and describes each store as though you were walking down the street with her. Her recommendations also include descriptions of Parisian neighborhoods and some interesting eating options - mostly for lighter meals, with a strong emphasis on tea houses. Unlike the Born to Shop series (w/ its annoying, snobby/cloying cuteness), she discusses shops in all price ranges, in a clear writing style that allows you to decide if a particular shop is for you.I hope she turns this into a series."
4,Solid Introduction to Fireworks,"Fireworks 4 for Visual Learners presents Macromedia's rich featured web graphics program in a clear, understandable format which is understandable for the beginning web page designer. Using screenshots with graphic prompts, Fireworks 4 for the Visual Learner introduces concepts and then builds in practice with that concept as other concepts are introduced. The book covers many of the features of the program with a concluding section on incorporating graphics into simple webpages. Fireworks 4 for Visual Learners provides a firm visual foundation for using Fireworks which should enable the new user to quickly use the program and later explore the richness of Fireworks."
5,An excellent and easy visual book Fireworks book,This is an excellent Fireworks 4 book that lets you get the hang on Fireworks 4 in a no-nonsence manner by doing a hands on tutorial.This will reinforce your learning by doing and will accelerate the learning process.I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about Fireworks 4.0.
2,I just don't know...,"This is the first Danielle Steel novel I have ever read, and I dislike it more than I like it. The plot, although slightly unbelievable, was interesting. I cared about some of the characters and their situations. The writing was surprisingly good, at times. But I did feel it was unrealistic. How many problems can one girl go through in 23 years of life? She had some BAD luck meeting the WRONG people... Some of the writing was bad, just as some of the writing was good. I could sense when she was hurrying through a particular passage or scene. All in all, I'll probably read another...but I wasn't terribly impressed."
5,its the most heartwrenching book i read,it is an excellent book.i finished it in one day and cried all the time.the typoe of book u want to share it with your family.a must read.
4,The Long Road Home by Danielle Steel,This was truly one of Danielle Steel better books. At times I wished I could step in and help it drew you right into the book.It makes you really wonder if the abuse is going on next door and you either turn your head or do not pay attention. Give this one a try I am sure you will not be able to put down.
5,You Can't Put It Down!,"This had be from beginning to end. Very Hard to put down..its usually a hit or miss with her books but this one was a hit! another good book is ""Missing"". this will give you a whirlwind of emotions!"
1,A Long Road Home,"Danielle Steele- A Long Road HomeThis is the worst book I have read in a long time. It is the most depressing book I have ever read. She spends too much time on the beating of the child which is done over and over, then the beating by the man in the boarding house and its only in the last 20% of the book that anything looks a little better. This book is so unlike any of Steels books and I would definetly not recomend it to anyone."
1,Worst Steel book I've read,"The plot was completely unbelievable; far beyond willing suspension of disbelief. I read it as fast as I could to see what happened to get it over with. It's a shame Steel took such an important subject matter, child abuse, and created a book that is pure misery to read, not because of the subject matter, but her poor craftsmanship. Gabreilla's innocent years in the convent and the beginning of her romance with Joe were classic Steel, but the horror of the end of that romance and the subsequent plot line will make you cringe if you've read some of her best such as Jewels or Crossings."
5,Can't put down book,"I read this book so quick, I didn't want to put it down. A sad, scarey, heartwarming, love story. What this poor Gabriella went through was terrible and it scares me to know things like this truly happen to children growing up. This is a must read book."
5,its the best one of her books,"I read this book in one day and I could not put it down it hit you at the very heart of your soul you felt for that little child you felt all the emotions like crying, hatred towards the mother and happy that she end up happy"
4,"I loved it, although, I felt the ending was little weak.","I really enjoyed reading The Long Road Home, although I feel that Danielle Steel ""wimped out"" in the end where Gabrielle goes to meet her mother (I won't say any more than that so I don't ruin it for people who have not read the book)...I would, however, recommend it to friends...Enjoy!!"
4,The Emotional Book,"This book tells so many stories, but it leaves you with a thought of comfort, especially when knowing that a child has been through hell, and is going to still be sane. I recommend for anyone to read this book.Although I do believe that it is gearded towards more mature readers because of some of the material. This book can probably be described with one word and that is emotional."
1,DIDN'T READ YET,"I used to enjoy reading any of Steele's books, but lately, i've been getting agitated with the re- dundancy of her characters. The best book ever was ""No Greater Love"". Does anybody agree with me?vondelevondele@netscape.net"
2,Bland.....Not really enrapturing.,"This book was not good! It was the first, and let me assure u the last, book of Steele's that I've ever read. It was slow, the characters weren't done well, and the dialogue was unreal. Halfway through the book, I wanted to stop, it was so boring, and nothing had happened, but I was on a plane and had nothing better to do, so I finished it. At the end, I felt empty. It was a waste of time and money. The only reason I gaave it two starz was that it had its moments, and I had to give Steele credit for trying."
2,Typical Steele - followed her formula to the letter,"If you've read her other books, you could have written this one yourself. I could absolutely put this one down, because it is so depressing, and one tragic episode after another - the minute something good starts happening you can predict what will be next. I wouldn't recommend this if you've read all her others, but if you haven't, and enjoy tragedy than this is great!!"
3,True depliction of child abuse - how to overcome low esteem.,"I found this book very hard to get into at first. The first 6 chapters described the child abuse in such detail that I found it hard to keep reading. This book does not seem like a regular Danielle Steel book to me, but it was a great read after all."
3,Very uncomfortable reading,"The abuse both as a child and as an adult were very difficult to get through. I forced myself to finish, it is a subject we should all be aware of. But the ending left me feeling empty - this serious problem does exist and there is no 'happy ending'."
4,I found it a very moving book to read.,I have read many of her books but found the story line very moving. I really enjoyed reading this book and found it hard to put down.. Would recommend this book to you to read.
5,The Long Road Home,"The Long Road Home,was an outstanding book to read. I didn't understand how the parents of this little girl could not love her. It showed me that not all people are made out to be parents. I thought the little girl was a strong person for putting up with her parents. When she was sent to live at the church with the nuns,it was good for her to get out of the situation she was in. She was still very quite and was into writing her novels. I thought what she did when she got pregnant by the priest, was an excuise for somebody to love her.When she had lost the baby,she found hope in finding her parents.She found out her mother had died and her father was living only a block away.I think this book is a great book for almost everyone to read."
4,Slightly less formulaic due to unusual storyline,"This is a MUCH darker and more graphic outing for Steel, and more risque because of some of her subject matter. However, I think her antagonists do not meet the fate that they could or should have. The writing is superior to THE RANCH or more recent publications-less repetitive in the narrative descriptions. It was more compelling than the usual Danielle Steel fare-pretty woman, distressed situation, white knight eventually swoops down and aids her. While the pretty woman exists here too, the setting is unique and it takes the white knight a much longer time to ride her off into the sunset. However, I kept wishing for stronger consequences for the parents in the story, meted out by the heroine, Gabriella, or at least some intervention by those she encounters."
1,Rubbish!,"This was the very first Danielle Steele book I ever read, and I decided to buy it to find out why she is constantly on the best seller lists. My, was I disappointed. Her English is childish and the some of the chapters were crying out for proper editing! For an author so popular I had expected a highly skilled and eloquent form of writing. That is definitely not what I got. Although I was in suspense for most of the book, and some of it did bring out feelings of anger and sadness, the story was too dramatic and unrealistic. I mean really, how could one person go through so many tragedies in their life? I brought the book on holidays with me and every time something bad happened to the main character (every 5 minutes!) I told my friends who were with me and we just laughed and laughed and laughed. It was so stupid! If you want a trashy novel, go ahead and buy it. But otherwise, stay away, stay well away!"
3,This actually gets 3 1/2 stars from me,"This is a good book by romantic standards, and a decent book by my standards. The abuse that Gabriella suffered was realistically written and so was the way Steel described the scars that it left on her character. I liked most of the characters and the book was fast paced. However, I find a sexual relationship between a priest and an almost-nun disgusting. I didn't like the priest and found him to a weakling. I also didn't like that through out the book Gabriella was constantly leaning on a man to give meaning to her life. It would have been nice to see her be more independent. All in all I say this book is worth reading."
4,not a Steel fan but this book is surely one of her best...............,well written book.........story keeps flowing and isnt so predictable either.......i just wish DANIELLE STEEL wrote suspense....her book are like Sidney Sheldon's books without the Suspense.........all in all a GOOD Book....
2,Poorly written and unrealistic,"No one is all bad or all good. I wish someone had told Ms. Steel that before she began writing this book. The characters throughout the book are exceedingly unbelievable, with the main character's mother being the Devil Incarnate. The book was tolerable and elicited a gasp from me in one place, so I grudgingly gave it two stars instead of just one."
2,You've Got to Be Kidding Me,"I cannot believe all the 5 star reviews for this book. If you want to read a book filled with graphic descriptions of child abuse, then this book is for you. I am a DS fan, but I was shocked and disturbed by this book. BUT, perhaps that's what DS wanted to achieve, and if so, she succeeded. But for me, I will stick to her other, uplifting stories that are not so brutal."
4,Loved it... except the ending!!!,"I fell in love with the charactor of Gabbie and the nuns however... I felt like the ending seriously needed some help. Although thats how it is with most of her books... it stopped a little too abruptly and I was thinking ""Thats it?!?"" But it is a really amazing story of love and strength and courage and it was very inspiring. It was one of my favorites."
5,The Long Road Home,I really enjoyed this book. I felt like I could relate to Gabriella in some way even though I haven't been treated like she had. Just for some reason I did.Danielle Steel wrote a good one. I think this is the best book I have read so far.
1,The Long Road Home,I could not finish this book; I do not like books that disturb me and I cannot stand to read about or see children abused. I would not recommend this book to anybody and have deleted it from my Kindle.
5,A Book that you must read!,"This book takes place in a rich home of a little girl who is constantly beaten ny her mother who is excessibly jelous of her little girl. Her mother not only beats her phisically, but emotionally also. Her father who she portrays as Prince Charming never steps in to help his little girl who was also afraid of the mother. Eventually he leaves the mother and the little girl to fend for herself, luckily her mother meets another man and decided to go to Reno while her mother sticks her in a convent and never comes back for her. That happends to be the best thing that happends to her, as she grows up in the convent and wants to live a rich a healthy life but always afraid to go outside the convent walls afraid of what she will find there. But once she is older and commits a sin that is so great they must force her to leave and she is now learning to live on her own. This book is one that you will love! I really recommend this one!"
4,The Long Road Home,"Another Danielle Steel story written well and very even spaced, as drama goes. This book should give everyone the courage to face life with everything within themselves and be able to keep on living and loving."
3,The Long Book,"I enjoyed another of Daniel Steel's books. I do admit that it was rather long. I didn't expect to read about such graphic scenes nor feel so angry and helpless. Children who are abused lead a broken life and are scared for life. This novel touched, taught and moved me. This book should be read by all. This book contains inspiration for forgiveness and the healing towards abuse. This topic is a very untouched one and Daniel Steel's novel portrays it very well."
4,great - up until half way through,"I thought that the book was excellent, i couldn't put it down, however it was a real disapointment when Joe (the priest) killed himself and Gabbie found someone else. I mean it was good for her, but it would have been much much sweeter if Joe did live, and they both got kicked out of the convent and the rest of the story talked about how they survived New York, this is the only reason I was not able to give it 5 stars - great, but a disapointing ending"
