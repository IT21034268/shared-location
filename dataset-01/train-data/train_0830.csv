1,bicycle replica,"This is a low end product. It will work at least for a while if assembled correctly but it is heavy and uses bottom of the barrel components. Obviously not everyone can go out and buy a better bike so if this is what you can afford then go for it. But be realistic as well. A bike is something that you may have for years to come. A better bike is just that- better, as in easier to ride, maintain, and have fun with. I learned my lesson. Now I'm saving a little while longer for a real bike."
2,Ouch!,"When I first purchased this product for my son he was enthusiastic. Once we got it home, assembled it, and started riding, the enthusiasim quickly wore off.The derailers shift very sloppily, Had to replace them in week 2, the ""shock"" is a cheap spring that has little or no adjustment (replacement ~$ 200.00), the handle bar neck (2 bolt clasp) comes loose during every ride, replaced that neck in week 2 with a 4 bolt version, the front shocks started sticking in the 2nd week, I'm looking for new ones (avg cost ~$200.00).Save your money and buy a more high end bike that already has these quality components, otherwise you will be spending lots of time at your local bikestore upgrading like I am."
1,The bike is beautiful,"but arrived with lot of scratches and the bike peddles r too delicate , with normal use of 1 hr it is ripped from sides, the gears r not aligned and the front tire rim wobbles slightly"
4,Looks great,Had for a season and has a well built frame. Great price for a full suspension bike. Tires and tubes not so great..First upgrade I made. Shifting takes time to adjust..Need stem riser to raise handlebars to be comfortable. Pedals are plastic and not so comfy on long rides. Seat just throw away and get a Cloud 9 gel seat. Have done many upgrades to get bike the way I like it. Still cheaper that those $6000.00 dollar bikes.
4,Definitely not for beginners / not for people with our patience,"Great bike! Very fast shipping! I was expecting it to arrive on Mar 22-24 but it arrived on the 19th... Requires a lot of patience and a few handyman experience since you will be assembling this bike. I will already start using the bike tomorrow. No more buses for me then! I will now shop for some accessories... the reflectors that comes with the package is not that good, one of the reflectors snapped and break with just a slight effort."
2,Get something else,This bike is not worth $300 but if you could get it for the $150 some reviewers got it for that's a different story. It's heavy and very slow. It seems like I'm using all my energy and going 2 mph. I usually ride a road bike 100 miles per week so it's not me. I would go for a hardtail columbia bike or something for $300 if I could do it over. The suspension just adds weight and soaks up all the pedaling power.
4,Bicycle,"I enjoiyed very much to buy across your site. Amazon is a goog way and the product is very beautiful, I am very satisfyied with my bike and I recommend for all of your customers.Kind regards,Alexandre Alcolea."
4,Solicitud de envio de Factura al embarcador,"Estimado Sres. al producto GMC Topkick de doble suspension, en el envio al parecer no recepcionaron la Factura, agradeceria la ayuda que pudieran prestarme ante tal eventualidad.Cordial saludo,Victor Alfonzo"
1,LOL,"This bike is a joke. GMC makes vehicles, not bicycles. Do not waste your time. The cheap mechanical disc brakes on this bike are no more powerful than a standard rim brake, and will rub no matter what. Disc brakes are nice, but only when you upgrade to the hydraulic systems found on high end bicycles. The dual suspension shock system on this bicycle will only bob and cause you to be less efficient. The single wall wheels will buckle or bend if you ever hit a rock or curb. Go to a bicycle shop and ask for help finding a bike that will best suite you. Trust me, if you ask a mechanic at a bike shop what they think of GMC bicycles, they will laugh and tell you to look in another direction."
1,Not safe,"I had used this product every now and then for a couple of years. I went for a ride a month ago and was pedaling very hard when there was a malfunction with the gears and the chain and something broke. That gear no longer works on the bike. Because I was pedaling so hard, and all of the resistance in that gear suddenly disappeared, I was off balance and took a nasty spill. I was lucky and will only end up with a few scars.I am tall and weigh almost 200 lbs. So keep that in mind if you plan on buying this. I will most likely still use it, but only to cruise around slowly with my wife and kids. I don't think this bike is very sturdy and I don't recommend it."
3,Not as pictured,"Upon taking bike out of box, spoke was bent due to packaging. Several dings or scratches on bike. ""Owners manual"" is terrbile. Does not show how to adjust the disc style brakes the bike is equiped with. Sticker on front of bike is peeling off. Color of graphics is completely different than pictured on website. All of this, and I haven't even put it together or taken it for a ride."
3,Heavy,"The bike was easy to assemble. The gears need adjusted by a bike shop but I'm too lazy to take it there. It rides great down stairs and over obstacles but it's weight makes it a lot less maneuverable then I expected. This will be great for getting around my college campus but I won't be riding it on the trails anytime soon. It also looks a lot more expensive then it was, so I will be 'aging' it purposely so it doesn't look so new."
1,Broken Product and have yet to receive money back.,"When I looked at the reviews this one had the best so I decided it was safe to get my bike from this seller. Yes my bike came in on time, but the packaging could have been a whole lot better. The frame of the bike was scratched because of inadequate packaging materials. During the 2 hours of putting my bike together I noticed that the threading on where you screw in the pedal was defective. I then took the bike for a ride and the pedal came off. I figured I could buy some extra things to make the bike possibly work but in the end I figured it was not worth the hassle when I was sent a defective product. I had to take the bike apart and then drop it off at a UPS store. When I sent the bike back I was supposed to get my money back immediately. I have yet to see my money come back. Overall I am very dissapointed."
2,GMC Topkick Bike has nothing to do with a truck rigidity,"Images on the web look great. The reality is very different:First impression: I was surprised to see half way detached GMC logo on the front of the unit.The frame is 19"", not 26"" as listed by mistake or on purpose on the web.The frame welding is very poor.The unit is not as stable as it looks - if more pressure is applied to the pedals (speeding up), squeaking noise can be heard from the crank shaft area.I received the unit with a bent rear derailleur bracket.I understand that the unit is inexpensive, but I was expecting at least Walmart bike selection quality of a similar price and this was not the case.Thanks to Amazon's great policy, I returned the bike and got my refund.I will never buy another bike that is not a bike brand.Alex"
3,Rare Inner Tubes...,"First, based on my experience, don't rely on the specifications posted here for the GMC Topkick Dual-Suspension Mountain Bike; actual parts used and their specifications may vary. Kent does not publish the same specifications.Second, the original inner tubes for this bike are short on MTB durability and replacements are rare. The tubes on mine have a 48mm or ""Long"" Schrader valve stem rather than a standard length Schrader, which will not extend through the deep-v rim used on this bike. You can order replacements directly from Kent, use a Schrader valve extension, or convert to inner tubes with 48mm Presta stems.In a little over three months of ownership, various components and assemblies have needed repair or replacement, including the inner tubes, pedals, brake discs, hub, and cables. Kent International has been very courteous in my dealings with them."
4,ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS,"THIS BICYCLE IS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED. ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT THERE WERE NO ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS PACKAGED WITH THE BIKE. AN OWNERS MANUAL CAME WITH IT, BUT ALL IT TELLS YOU IS TO SEE YOUR DEALER IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, PLUS ALL THE SAFETY INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR A BICYCLE. OTHER THAN HAVING TO FIGURE OUT THE ASSEMBLY, THIS IS A VERY NICE BIKE."
2,GMC Topkick bike,"this bike is not made by GMC! Don't let the stickers fool you. This is a KENT bike using GM logos and trademarks under license. The bike is pretty good for a KENT but first when i got it there were many adjustments to be made. like the gears, middle and rear, and the brakes. The rear suspension sucks. I don't mean its defective, just the type of it, i feel as if there was no rear suspension at all. I gave it 2 stars because its pretty good for a KENT and all the extra options were pretty nice to have. (after a lot of work and adjustments) for a GMC this is very bad. i am very annoyed with it. If you are looking for a high quality bike this is not a good choice"
3,"Poorly edited, well written","I have had the book for many years, (since 1983), but had never read it clear through. Just finished it yesterday. Smith does a good job of writing, but whoever edited this thing was asleep. Misspelled words and duplicated paragraphs abound.I was particularly impressed with the insight Smith had into the way JFK manipulated the media and anyone who would dare to disagree with him. His brother, Robert, misused the office of Attorney General to threaten, investigate, and blackmail anyone who dared cross JFK. The documentation Smith has provided is great.Can't help but think all the way through the book about what Matt Drudge would have been able to do to JFK with today's technology.Altogether worth the read. Just try to ignore the poor editing."
5,The Films of Robert Taylor,Fantastic book for Robert Taylor fans!! Has an in-depth biography of his life and his films and great photographs of his various roles in his movies.
4,A Pretty Good Buick Book,"Well, I must say that this is a unique and one of a kind book. It has tons of pictures and collectible prices (values). It has alot of items that I don't have in my collection and the ones that I do have it was cool to be able to see the average value of them. I found one in there, a Dale Earnhardt Ertl car, that has over a $500 value. If you collect buick stuff you need this book. Its about 70% racing items and the regular stuff only goes back to about the 1960's but thats really ok with me as I am only really interested in the buick muscle cars and the turbo cars. Anyway, hope this helps you if you are thinking about getting this book. And, since there really arent alot of buick books on the market its a great one to just add to your library even if you dont collect buick stuff but are just curious."
1,Misleading title - Only similar playlist from original LP release,"Note that some cuts are missing or substituted from the original playlist. The original LP release of Brubeck on Campus had the following cuts:Balcony RockOut of NowhereLeSoukTake the ""A"" TrainThe Song is YouDon't Worry 'Bout MeI Want To Be HappyOne Moment Worth YearsThese Foolish ThingsSt. Louis BluesI'm Afraid the Masquerade Is OverBru's BluesCampare for youself, what the CD with the same title has to offer. I think this is VERY misleading for those folks who don't have the original to compare it to."
5,A New Cathy Jean Fan,"Hey there! I've been looking at her ad in all the Blues magazines for months and finally picked up ""I Want"". Wow! I am impressed with the vocals and all-around quality of this CD. It really is terrific! So inspiring, that I am going to order her first CD for me! Its one thing to be a pretty singer, but she also backs it up with the music! Thank you!"
5,Holy Momma,She punches the dirty bastards right out of their misery on this one! Great sounds...I like it...sure sounds like she went through a bit of the real life blues. I sure hope that an absolute knock out gorgeous lady like her really is not a blues singing alcoholic...keep up the punching...knock em dead...the band is tight.
5,Immitation is flattery you betcha!,"Here we are more than a decade down the road and I say, ""take a look around at all these sexy blues women, blues folks!"". Seems Cathy Jean had it goin' on then and she has it goin' on now-- continuing to open doors for generations of sexy blues-rock women-- all the while she's still a youngin' herself! I love the raw wounds dripping from Cathy's voice on this record. The pissed-off-ed-ness of ""Be Glad""' ""Unfinished Business"", ""Suffer"", and ""I Want Your Mother to Know/Rotten B."", the true despair of ""**4 in the Morning**"" and ""Please Stop Seeing that Girl"", and the joking (?) ""Blues Singin' Alcoholic"". This girl has a brilliant mind. Love it!"
3,The Lamplighter,"In a nineteenth-century Edinburgh both real and psychological, a brutal monster stalks the streets.This is a strange, strange book. O'Neill has a wonderful sense of incongruity and sometimes of humor, but often his diction is distanced and formal, in keeping with the historical setting but having the effect of pushing the reader out. The speculative elements are fascinating on an intellectual level--particularly the characters who may or may not be physically real--but despite the guts sometimes splattered across the page, I didn't find them viscerally effective. What was metaphor, and what was not? The boundary is uncertain. The distanced tone tends to rob the narrative of drama, though allowing wonderfully subtle turns of phrase.Here and there something in dialogue struck me as vaguely anachronistic. The leeries, though, were very cool.An ambitious book and an intelligent one, but one which in the final analysis never really engaged me."
2,Disappointing,This book could have been so much better. The story was interesting for a while until the author got bogged down in a philosophical/religious quagmire. The characters aren't developed well and the ending was unbelievable.
3,An interesting but tough read,"Echoing the feel of a good Victorian novel, The Lamplighter successfully pits men of Reason against the supernatural. I recommend reading this book as a piece of fine literature, but I must also warn the reader that it's not a light or easy read and requires attention. There were some sluggish moments, but the book's resolution was very well paced and rewarding."
3,LOST IN THE FOG,"THE LAMPLIGHTER is one of those books that leaves you feeling a little confused. While marvelously written scenes evoking the 19th century Edinburgh frame this novel, much of its substance gets a little too esoteric. Evelyn Todd's character is certainly multi-faceted, and her powerful imagination certainly breeds a rather contemptuous killer. I agree with a fellow reviewer's comments that the overlapping of the investigations by the police and the freelance professor and his friend does bog the novel down somewhat. The transference of Satan from body to body stretches the imagination a little too much and we end up with a novel that doesn't know where it wants us to go. O'Neill is definitely talented, but I was expecting something a little more straightforward and accessible.RECOMMENDED FOR ITS LITERARY MERITS."
2,far out,"This was no page turner for me. I found it something too far out in weird land, plus you have plod through too much to get to the story, and then it is really too strange."
1,The Lamplighter,"I had high hopes for this novel, but instead it turned into a very good book to read if you want to take a nap. The author has a great talent for description, but abuses it in the extreme. He will use paragraphs to describe a scene, when a few lines expertly written will get the reader there much more enjoyably. There was so MUCH description, theological references and red herrings in the text that it put me to sleep quicker than reading a text on trigonometry. But, I persevered, as I was interested in what the 'beast' would really turn out to be. The finale was underwhelming in the extreme. We are supposed to believe that these people have walked in hell and come back out. I guess if I was a great believer that the devil likes to come and play tricks on police inspectors, gravekeepers, and professors, I might have found this a better read. I was very disappointed with the ending, the writing and the fact that I wasted my time."
3,Confusion,I found that the plot and some of the characters were a bit weird. At times I wasn't sure what the police detective was trying to accomplish and he came off as extremely insecure.
2,Plodding,I found this book hard to stay interested in. I read at least 5 other books while this one sat on the bedside table waiting to be finished. I only made my self finish it because I had paid full price for it.
1,Period piece with too much language,"I'm all for exercising one's extensive vocabulary, but unfortunately Mr. O'Neil takes that to the extremes in his book ""The Lamplighter."" I will preface this review by stating I have little desire to finish the book because of O'Neil's overwhelming prose. Dear sir, we live in the 20th century (your book is copyrighted 2003), this is no longer the Victorian era, thus you should not be writing that way. There are easier ways to get your story out than to exhaust the reader by making them read the same sentence three times to understand it. The premise of the book is excellent and it did pique my curiosity, but I'm not in college anymore and I want to enjoy what I read."
2,Salty eye candy,Looks great from the cover....Should have remembered...dont judge a book by it's cover. There are no color images in teh book which based on the content was a bad editorial choice. This sort of publication needs to have color. You look at the cover and think it's going to be color.
4,My New Favorite Christmas Album,"This is now in my top five favorite Christmas albums. The arrangements are incredible and moving. A perfect blend of voice and instruments in most of the songs. My favorite song from the album is: 14 What Shall We Give to the Babe in the Manger. I give it 4 stars because there are a couple of songs that are not my favorite, although the good ones make up for it. I would give it 4 1/2, but that is not an option."
4,fun horror-fantasy,"A young adult horror-fantasy, well-characterized, with unexpected but welcome bursts of humor, a tight, fast-moving plot and excellent writing."
4,comfortable,I bought this seat for my daughter. She said that the springs in the seat worked well when she went over bumps. The seat is not too large for a kid's bike and it works well for adult bikes.
1,Velo Webspring Bicycle Seat,The bicycle seat is comfortable however it does not wear well. As you continue to use it the material will tear and as time passes the foam will show through. The covering on the seat should be made of a more durable material
4,Nice little glove.,Got this for my 8yo son and it is a perfect fit for him. Very soft & easy to close with virtually no break in required. Durable and sturdy.
1,Horrible aftertaste,"They taste good at first, but they have the absolute WORST aftertaste ever. I ate the strongest-tasting things I could find, brushed my teeth at least 3 times, and when I woke up the next morning, it was still there. DO NOT BUY THESE."
5,THE VERVE PIPE EVOLVES WITH EVERY ALBUM!,"I adore this album!!!!! The Verve Pipe has done it again! There are many gems including La La, Hero, Television, She Has Faces and Kiss Me Idle, to just name a few. The thing I enjoy most about this disc is how diverse it is.Those who had negative comments on this album must take a few more listens! This is one of those CDs that get better with every listen. The Verve Pipe right timeless music, and their latest release is no exception."
2,Recording???,Good music. *BAD*- recording. I can't believe EVERYONE has not said something about the recording. What the heck is the production crew thinking with this one? I can't even listen to it. Too bad. Love those guys.
4,"Worth it for Verve Pipe fans...otherwise, I'd think twice","What: the follow up to the Verve Pipe's excellent Villains album.Style: The same grungy-but-harmonious guitars and kicking drums, but with a new element of buzzy keyboards and drum machines.Pros: flows well. Most of the songs segue together, giving the album a feel of being an integrated whole, as opposed to merely a loose collection of songs. The keyboards add another dimension of the sound to the mix (they were present in Villains, for example the organ in ""Photograph"" and the piano in ""Cattle"", but were always very peripheral to the guitars).Cons: less variance than Villains. Most of the songs are love songs of some form or another, usually very upbeat (with the notable exception of ""Generations"" and ""The F Word"").Bottom line: Verve Pipe fans would probably enjoy this CD, even if it isn't the 90s' Dark Side of the Moon. People who just liked ""The Freshmen"", though, probably won't give this one much time in the CD tray."
3,"unsatisfying follow up to ""Villains""","When I listened to TVP's major label debut, ""Villains"" for the first time, I was taken aback at the amazing chemistry this group had. I've been anticipating this new album for more than a year. However, it clearly does not live up to ""Villains"" standards. The worst part about the sound of this album is it seems Vander Ark's voice has gotten much younger and higher, especiallly on La La. Gone are the heaviness of songs like Villains and Cup of tea. Also, the songs and total CD are much shorter than their last album. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent band, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars; however if I were a professional critic I would give it 1 or 2. Don't waste your money on this and buy ""Villains"" or "" pop Smear"" instead"
4,A CD worth your investment...,"Some of the songs on this album bored me a little, but most of them rocked! I especially love HERO and LA LA, and SUPERGIG is a great song too. I thought there was something really different about this album and the last, though I can't put my finger on what. Even still, I recommend this CD to most/all alternative fans."
2,What happened?,"From the first time I heard Villains, I knew it was a great album (even the radio-sap of ""The Freshmen"" is OK in the context of the whole), and repeated listenings to Pop Smear reveals a different yet equally great work.I wanted very much to like ""The Verve Pipe"". A lot of the songs are good. A couple are great. The SOUND is what's missing. Technically, the guitars sound like they were recorded direct instead of through cranked up amplifiers. There's a lot of distortion that screams incompetent recording engineers. There's a clinical iciness to it all-no warmth or punch (especially the drums!).Too bad. This could have been a really good album when rock really needs it. Fortunately, there's Radiohead."
4,very excellent,"this is a very good cd. most of the songs could be blockbuster hits in themselves, especially hero, television, and in between. my only qualm is that the recording quality is only slightly above average. other than that this is a great cd for any fan of rock and alternative. enjoy!!!!!!"
4,Critics way off - new album is better,"To qualify my review: I hated Pop Smear except for ""Sugar"" and liked Villians except for ""Freshman"". That said - the new album: I can you could listen to this album only once and give it a lukewarm review - which probably is the case with most of the critics (like Rolling Stone magazine). Granted - it's not as easily accesible as ""Villians"", and yes the sound is a little scratchy in a few places - but the more I listen to this album the more I appreciate it. The lyrics and vocals are top-notch - every song on the album takes you somewhere. The guitar work is awesome - but you have to listen harder to get it. I love the inclusion of Craig Wedrin (of ""Shudder to Think"") as a backup vocalist. (Check THOSE guys out if you really want to blow your mind!). If ""Villians"" is like Budweiser - decent enough so that alot of people like it - the new album is like Sam Adams - it won't appeal to as wide of an audience, but those who catch on to it appreciate the difference."
5,i liked it,"having bought Villians, then this album, I probably approached this band differently from most. I didn't know anything about them, or what they sounded like - but I wanted to find out. I lilked this album - no, I love it. It is great. Just like every other tvp album, there is a great variety of songs, each telling a story, and each one makes you want to find out where it came from. There are some stunning melodies, and Brian Vander Ark's voice is so well suited to a sweet ballad like ""kiss me idle"" - and ""half a mind"" is a brilliant song, and one I'm sure a lot of people can relate to. It's got rock, and pop, and is yet another album to be taken seriously, while having fun!"
4,their best so far...,Yihaa - the new verve pipe sounds really good. Sure - I just listened to it once but the results sounds really promising! The style is Tonic type of refrain rock with a touch of more alternative acts. All with a great melodic sense. A sure check out if you like modern rock with a touch of some god damn it.
1,White bread and watered down.,"My guess is that, in the not too distant future, the Verve Pipe will be just about ready for a VH-1 ""Where are they now?"" special. On second thought, skip that. They're way too boring.Yours in haste, Bryan Charles"
3,florida's hsct: preparing for the communications,"follow directions; what, when, where, who etc.;cause and effect"
2,good product but POOR shipping,"i ordered this product on december 6, in plenty of time for christmas; it took several weeks to arrive. very undependable because of this."
5,"Perfection, Organic Essential Oil",I prefer to wear a spicy scent rather than a flowery scent. I found the aroma of this oil a wonderful combination of both!
3,"Not happy with this bread, it is too sweet for all but butter and jam","I have been eating gluten free bread for some time and tried many, but this bread is too strange. It is sweet enough to be a problem if you want to eat it as a sandwich or with anything salted. It becomes quite obvious that it is sweet. I am assuming that this has to do with the sorghum and grape juice, but mostly with the sorghum, I am sure as I have made bread with grape juice in it and it tasted just fine with all salted and sweet condiments on or with it.I am very disappointed and really don;t like this bread much as a general bread. I was going to make some pizza but am worried that it too will have that sweet aftertaste, not exactly great for pizza.So, if you mostly eat bread with jam then its an okay bread but if you want this to be your main bread for anything including breadcrumbs, don't use this."
1,NOT a white bread mix.,"I found this darker bread to have an off putting slightly sweet taste. I will probably use the remaining packages to make a spice cookie. It's most like a quick bread, and it doesn't toast well. Too bad amazon doesn't carry the 'Cause Your Special' brand of white bread, since it actually taste like the real deal."
4,Glad I Gave it Another Try!,"I had tried this bread mix when I first went GF and didn't care for it, but after becoming so disappointed in other mixes (Gluten-Free Pantry, Bob's Red Mill) I decided to try it again and pay more attention to the directions. This time it came out better, although as noted elsewhere, it is rather sweet, which for me is not quite what I'm used to for a sandwich. However, the flavor is certainly tasty (vs. the bland, cardboard taste of GF Pantry), but it's much denser, and doesn't make as big a loaf. I only make it in a bread machine, and the directions have you use the regular cycle rather than the GF one, which is what I had not done before. It takes much longer, but I was pleased with it, and will buy it again. I think perhaps adding herbs might cut the sweetness, although maybe it will clash - I'll find out!Debbie"
5,More classic stooge mayhem,"In Healthy, Wealthy, and Dumb, Curly wins the Coffin Nail cigarette contest. The boys go out and spend the prize, and wreck a fancy hotel room before they find out that the prize has vanished because of taxes. More good stuff from the stooges."
3,A few good shorts.,"This is an okay DVD. There are three shorts I like, and three that bore me. I enjoyed HEALTHY WEALTHY AND DUMB, IF A BODY MEETS A BODY, and ROCKIN' THRU THE ROCKIES. WHOOPS I'M AN INDIAN, GENTS WITHOUT CENTS, and PHONY EXPRESS bored me. Still an okay DVD."
4,Nice Rainy Day Book,"Gwen thinks her ditszy,widowed mother may be having an affair with the young,handsome writer boarding at their historic Louisiana home. Worried that he's taking advantage, she comes home from NY to check him out. Then, she falls for him herself! Several red herrings in plot lead to a surprise ending.Excerpt from the back of the book:""Her mother needed her, Gwen had decided. So she took a vacation from her demanding NY job at prestigious Style magazine to go home to Louisiana. She was sure her mother was being duped by author Luke Powers. How could anyone fall for such a man?When Gwen met Luke, she discovered the answer to her question:Luke was the most attractive man she had ever met. Gwen knew she should persuade him to return to his native California, but how could she, when she knew that he would take her heart with him?"""
2,mediocre story,"I found the entire concept upon which the story is based, that Gwen left her job in NY and came home to new Orleans to break up an assumed affair (which turned out to be unfounded) between her 47 year old mother and a man 12 years younger, to be totally proposterous.One thing I find very annoying in romance novels is incessant and unnecessary bickering between the characters, supposedly representing sexual tension or a conflict. Gwen immediately responded to Luke with undeserved harsh animosity, judging him without knowing anything about him or having the facts straight. Gwen was so quick to assume the worst about him (she was also too quick to have sex with him, especially while proclaiming to dislike him so much). Luke summed it up best when he told Gwen that one day, she just might be the woman her mother is, one who looks for the good in everyone and finds it."
5,J.R.R. Tolkient he Greatest writer that ever lived.,"Lord of the Rings is the greatest movie I`ve ever seen. It has great special fx, it was very well planned, and it has awsome details. I think that the director has an incredible imagination, but i give most of the credit to J.R.R Tolkien for creating such a place and for having a greater imagination than any other child in this world. J.R.R Tolkien was given an incredible gift and I thank him for sharing that with us. J.R.R Tolkien the greatest writer that ever lived"
1,WOW,"I cant believe how many people like this movie for that Elijah (or however you spell his name) kid. I personally think he is butt ugly. No offense to his mom if she reads this, but its true, your kid is ugly :)PS: Ive never heard of this kid in my life."
5,Classic,Very good video. We purchased the movie after we read the book. Kids really understood story line. Definitely a keepsake.
4,Cute Show!,"I bought this for my little sister, who has just seen the live musical of Huckleberry Finn. She absolutely LOVES this disney version and watches it all of the time. It does have some language and violence that surprised me for a Disney movie. Great characters and the story is told very well."
4,The Adventures of Huck Finn,I used this as part of a literature unit with my students and it followed the book very closely but not so closely that we couldn't make some interesting comparisons.
2,For Mr. Holmes,"This movie was very dissapointing. I have recently spent over a month reading and going over this book in my 11th grade english class and afterwards we watched this version of the movie. Not only did the movie leave out many key scenes that effect the main character Huck greatly, the film fails to even half-way portray the main themes and satire of Twain's novel. Although this was a Disney version of the story and others who have posted previosly have said it has been cleaned up(implying that the novel was dirtly), the makers of this film could have done so much more. The fact that all it took was Huck's loving attitude to convince everyone around him, is almost an insult to all Twain did to make this great American novel convincing."
4,Tight!,"Well, i really liked this movie! So, i went and read the book. I know, i know, too big for a 12 year old, but i did. And jeez! It was thick! Ok, about the movie, it was sooo good! I absolutely loved it! Elijah Wood was cool in it, well, he is the hottest guy alive...yeah, anyways. And, i thought that he pulled off the character very well. And yes, they did lower Huck's age to accomadate for the appearance of Wood, because in reality, he was 12 years old. Or, was that his age in the movie? Can't remember. I saw the version made in the 60's, and was not impressed by it at all. Ok, it just was too old fationed. This one actually brought the book out, and made it seem real! The others are just kinda dull, if ya know what i mean. So, i would recommend it to anyone! It was such a cute movie! Wood is such a cute kid!!!"
3,Fine as a movie-Poor representation of Twain's novel,"I don't believe those who criticize the movie are necessarily of the opinion that it is a poor movie; I think it is a fine movie for kids. However, it does not do justice to the novel. No one should think that this movie comes close to depicting the story of Jim and Huck's adventures. Two of the best elements of the novel, Huck's realization (slow but sure) that Jim is human and Mark Twain's mockery of the people on shore, are simply not conveyed by this, or any other, video. Again, as a movie, it's a fine story, but it certainly fails to develop the Huck-Jim story, the most important storyline in the entire novel."
1,DESTROYED MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is a second rate job given to a first rate book! There isn't a raft in the movie until after Huck and Jim meet the muderers from the wrecked ferry. Tom Sawyer is barely mentioned in the movie even though he plays an important role. He is the one who gets shot and frees Jim, NOT Huck. The Romeo and Juliet scence with the King and Dulphin is completly removed from the story. This scence shows the town that they are frauds. On a final note the dialect of the time was disregared in the lines of Jim, and Huck's lines were not much better!!!"
3,Relax and enjoy this in spite of yourself,"Does this film capture the more difficult themes in the novel? No. Does this film accurately present the author's use of local color and irony? No. Is this a movie that can be taken seriously on any level? No.Is it enjoyable? Yes.This adaptation presents Huck Finn as pure childhood adventure, more in the spirit of Twain's _The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer_ than his more serious _The_Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn_. In its best moments, it is fun to watch.Unfortunately, in its worst moments, it is nearly insufferable. The soundtrack is unfortunately repetitive, and much of the humor is lost in its uninspired delivery. In this, it is your typical live-action Disney movie: great fun at times with little substance, tainted by moments of eye-rolling inanity.If you are willing to relax and turn off your brain for an hour and a half, this film is rather enjoyable. It's just not worth going out of your way to watch."
4,scientific discovery,The process of scientific discovery is rarely highlighted in movies. This DVD is a wonderful exception. Highly recommended.
1,Insects refered to as Animals?,"Well i wont waste much time on this review, Just to say 10 minutes of caving the rest reporting about animals that live in em'not such a great discovery considering most caves have the same insects (animals such as tigers and elephants would be offeneded to be put in the same catergory as things the size of pinheads ) wouldn't buy it not worth it hard to find any good caving DVD's this ain't one of em'!!"
5,Reading from my past,"This book has stories that were printed in a magazine that was printed for American children living in Japan during the 1950s. I remember reading them and am pleased to be able to now read them to my grandchildren. The pictures are the same, which is a thrill, as I remember these pictures almost more than I remember the stories. A great book of Japanese life and fairytales."
2,Dumbed down for Western kids,"I haven't read ALL the stories in this book, but sadly, the authors have tidied up the elements in the original folk and fairy tales to make them ""suitable"" for young readers. One example, in the classic tale The Monkey and the Crab, originally Monkey kills crab (in this version Monkey just kind of injures Crab); and in the original, charmingly, one of the friends of crab that ambushed Monkey was a cow pie! The cow pie is just sort of left out here. I would LOVE to see a collection of translated classic Japanese kid stories with the warts left where they are!"
5,MOST COMPREHENSIVE,"This book is, without a doubt, most comprehensive in understanding Basic Christian Doctrine. It was a textbook in the college I attended, and I am so thankful to again have a copy after 50 years. It is well assembled as far as areas of importance and interest."
5,This book is awesome,"Wow! Dr. Dave has given the pool world an amazing resource. ""The Illustrated Principles of Pool and Billiards"" is the best pool book I have ever seen ... and I have read lots of them. There are illustrations and photos on almost every page and the book is very easy to read. The book also presents some useful systems I have not seen presented anywhere else ... for example, the 30 degree rule. The book website is also great. The video clips have helped bring my game to a new level."
3,A GOOD BUT INCOMPLETE BOOK,"This is a good book, but with a few minuses:- is not talking about DIAMOND SYSTEMS which is a must for any serious player;- is not having a section/chapter about practicing drills - practice is vital for success;- it is too repetitive, the book should be less than 150 pages;- poor editing - many times 2 pages apart the diagram and the text.A much better book is PLAY YOUR BEST POOL by PHIL CAPELLE, the true deal for beginners, intermediate level and advanced players too. Probably the best book ever written about billiards/pool."
2,Disappointing,"I was so disappointed in this version of ""Emma"" on Masterpiece. Being broken into three parts, I was hoping it would be of the same caliber as A&E;'s ""Pride and Prejudice,"" but that was not the case. Jane Austen's carefully crafted dialogue was dumbed down into a bland, modern-day screenplay that frustrated more than entertained.From language to posture to expressions, the true essence of the characters, from Emma to Mr. Knightly to Harriet, was completely lost. As other reviewers have mentioned, the 1997 version with Kate Beckinsale is infinitely superior (though too short) in its authenticity, and that's the one to which I'll always turn when I don't have time to turn to the book itself."
5,Most enjoyable version of EMMA,"Truly the most enjoyable version of EMMA; perhaps not the most faithful recounting of the spirit of Jane Austen's work, it was most pleasant to watch. Ms. Garai is an excellent actor and this was her best work.I look forward to seeing more performances by her."
2,2 1/2 stars; disappointing,"If you would like to watch a period film with nice production values, one or two good actors, and a plot reminiscent of Jane Austen's novel ""Emma,"" you might be interested in this BBC offering. If you would actually like to see a film of the novel ""Emma,"" I suggest either of the two 1999 Emmas, with either Gwneth Paltrow or Kate Beckinsale as the heroine.Not recommended for those who value faithfulness to the spirit of the novel."
4,Best Adaptation Yet.,"This is by far the best adaptation of Emma yet. Romola Garai is brilliant as the effervescent, selfish, but good-hearted Emma. Johnny Lee Miller is a sympathetic but not overly dramatic Knightley. Their friendship is particularly well-built in this adaptation, and the way that the writers tied together Emma, Jane, and Frank Churchill is very well done and creative. The filming is beautiful. If you like Austen, you will love this!"
4,"Great movie, disappointing format","I absolutely LOVE this adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma! Naturally, I bought it for my own collection as soon as it was available at a financially reasonable price. The movie itself deserves 5 stars. It is charming and witty, plus it has its funny moments! (Perhaps not as much as Pride and Prejudice, but still...)Sad to say, the way that Emma was put onto DVD was quite disappointing. I hate how the movie is divided into the 4 episode format as it premiered on BBC. It gets annoying after a while to have to skip through the credit interruptions throughout the movie. Why couldn't the film just be all one thing like all of the other Jane Austen films? (i.e. Persuasion, Northanger Abbey, Pride and Prejudice) Why did it have to be different for this movie? This is where I have to give 3 stars.I'm not trying to discourage Jane Austen fans from buying or viewing this movie, but I'm just bracing them for a little surprise or disappointment on how Emma was put onto DVD."
4,Charming adaptation,"Maybe it is not by the letter but this adaptation is simply charming. All characters, All the locations, Emma's house really takes you to another time in the past. The cloths are very pretty. The additional material is not very good or interesting. I would like to see more subtitle options even this is a reg. 1..."
4,for true jane austin fans...,This was different than I expected...kind of a strange beginning and generally more light-hearted than other Jane Austin movies. If you are a true Jane Austin fan I think you will enjoy it because it does seem to follow the book more closely than shorter versions. It does seem to move slower in comparison to Pride and Prejudice which I think is partly due to the diversity of characters and that they are not as intertwined as other Austin classics.
1,Appalling,"For an average television production this is adequate. Beautiful costumes, beautiful settings, adequate acting. But as a televisions adaptation of Emma by Jane Austin I am simply shocked that this program has received so many good reviews. Why? The story does not adhere to the book. There is so much artistic license that at times I think that the writers have no sense of the spirit of Emma at all. The characters are not true to their literary nature. I could go on criticizing but I actually don't enjoy putting the creative efforts of others down. If you are looking for an entertaining period drama this is great. If you are looking for Emma you won't find her here. The writers are primarily at fault. Then the Director. Then the primary actors... in that order. If this were any old period flic I would give it a three star rating. As a adaptation of Emma by Jane Austin I wish I could give it a zero... a one star had to suffice."
4,A Fella's perspective - a review from a dad,"Hello dad's and gentlemen... one thing that I've learned over the last few years is that a great way to learn to understand your wives and daughters is to take the time to enjoy a good Jane Austin flick.... and this is a great one.This blows the other Gwenneth Paltrow one out of the water. With J. Austin, you need to take the time to tell the tale.So, guys, take the time to watch, learn... and push aside the need for sex and explosions.This is a well told tale of the inner workings of meddling relationships and prejudices, and how we overcome them with honesty and sincerity.The acting is incredible and photography is dead on for the tone, not to mention that it's clean for gals of all ages if they're interested enough in the tale. (which even my 6-year-old was)Gentlemen, take a couple evenings and snuggle up with your lady or daughters and let the story immerse you in this world of deep relationships, love, frustration and joy."
5,Great rendition!,I have seen a couple of versions of Emma but loved this 4 part miniseries. It described much more details in the story and added a great deal to character development. Excellent show.
5,Emma,It came very quickly. Was brand new like the description stated. I am very happy with everything!
5,Wonderfully entertaining,"I'm quite a big Austen fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I've read all of her books, and seen all of the movies, and this one was one of the best adaptations I've seen. I thought they did a great job bringing Miss Emma Woodhouse to the screen. Every single character is played so well, I felt myself being pulled into the movie. They did a great job casting perfect people to play each role. If you're an Austen fan, whether a huge fan, or dabbler, give this one a chance. You'll love it!"
2,Boring,"It was okay, but seem to drag to me. I also didn't feel a real the chemistry between Emma & Mr Knightley."
5,The Best Emma adaptation EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this adaptation of Emma! Romola Garai is so much better at the part than I expected, she doesn't just deliver lines like Gweneth Paltrow did, she IS Emma. And Jonny Miller is the most charming Mr. Knightley ever! The lenghth of the picture does it true justice and you get all the wonderful details from the book, nothing hardly is skipped over, if you truly love Jane Austen's book, you will enjoy this adaptation. My only regret is that it didn't last even longer than 4 hours :)"
5,"The best version of ""Emma""","I have seen all the film on Jane Austin's ""Emma"" that I can get my hands on and this is far the best. Romala Garai's acting is wonderful. The sets are superb. My favorite scene is when Emma dances with Knightly at the ball. For anyone who loves Jane Austin, this is a must."
2,Pointless Remake,"Sorry, Ms. Garai, this is almost a complete waste of time . . . Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow have said all that needs to be said. This version interprets the heck out of this thing, and adds a lot of dialogue to clarify their interpretation while cutting much of Austen's (superior) dialogue . Harriet's voice is grating, although they do develop her character more than some of the other versions. Emma constantly echoes Gwyneth Paltrow's portrayal--not surprisingly. I do like some of the points they make and some of the contrasts they draw: Emma's childhood fate, Miss Bates' poverty. All in all, though, not worth it. I would highly recommend either of the '97 versions over this."
2,Where's the humor?,"This is the most humorless Jane Austen adaptation I've seen. Wonderful comic characters such as Mr. Woodhouse, Mrs. Elton and Miss Bates are rendered boring. Pales in comparison to the Gwneth Paltrow version, both in casting, music and wit. I've enjoyed Romola Garai in the past, but here she overacts -- constantly making faces. The location photography while pretty, has no particular style. Biggest complaint: why is this spread over four hours? Hopelessly padded. Johnny Lee Miller is no Jeremy Northam. This production is only adequate."
4,Emma,A more light-hearted version than the one with Kiera Knightly. I enjoyed the comedy in this series and thought Romola Garai did a fabulous job in the lead!!
2,"Emma - Badly done, Emma, badly done","I have to say that Emma is one of my least favorite Jane Austen Characters to begin with. She is not especially sympathetic and in this version I am most displeased.First of all, Knightly (Johnny Lee Miller) is way too young - isn't there supposed to be a 15 year age difference? It looked to me like the producer's wanted a good looking actor instead of staying true to the story. That brings me to my next point - the dialouge. It seems that the screenwriter has decided to make changes that were un-necessary.The best versions of all of Jane's stories are the ones that stay true to the entire story. In the case of Emma, the version starring Kate Beckinsale is far better.This movie is watchable, but if you have read the book and have seen better productions, you will be disappointed."
4,Wonderful...until Emma turned to a watering pot!,"Watching through the first 2 parts of Masterpiece theater, I was convinced that this was the best Emma ever. However, the ending left me with much to be desired. Was Emma crying when Mr. Knightley was trying to confide his feelings to her? And then bursting into Mr. Knightley's study, sobbing that she cannot leave her father to marry him. Emma was such a strong character in the beginning, I don't understand why they turned her into a watering pot in the end. Perhaps it was that time of the month for Emma or the writer?I still watch the movie over and over again, though I always cringe and try to stop myself from fast forwarding at those parts. Other than that, I love Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller's portrayal of the characters."
4,Best Emma yet!,"Romola Garai is all wide eyed innocence, and earnestness. She is my favorite Emma. I have seen many versions of Emma, and I think this particular actress seems to nail the heart of the character. I was very moved by her performance."
5,Fab!!,"This version of Emma is definitely my new fav. Romola Garai is great as Emma Wodehouse, a spoiled, conceited, even at times manipulative wanna-be matchmaker but she still manages to be pretty darn likeable. I also liked that this version took the time to examine the lives of the other characters a bit more deeply. Of course, in true BBC style, the sets are lavish, the costumes are gorgeous, and every actor tailor made for their parts. Very well done!!"
4,Shorter version,Saw this movie on Masterpiece Theater and then saw another version that someone posted on You Tube. Noticed that they cut a whole scene out on the one televised on TV. Looked up the original running time posted on IMDB and noticed it said that this movie ran for 240 minutes. But noticed that the one being sold on Amazon is only 229 minutes. So I have a feeling that the one being sold here will be the version that cuts out that scene. Why do movies that were originally released in the UK always have to be edited down? That would probably be my only complaint.
5,"Finally, a LIKABLE Emma!","The previous two versions of Emma (Gwenyth Paltrow and Kate Bekinsale) left me completely frustrated with the character. Romola Garai has created an Emma that is likable, maybe even lovable. Her character flaws are depicted as symptoms of her unworldliness and loneliness due to her father's terror of the outside.The other character stories are fully developed, so the focus is not on Emma alone.My one objection would be the casting of Jodhi May as Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston. She and Romola Garai played romantic rivals in ""Daniel Deronda,"" (another Masterpiece, literally) and here she depicts Emma's governess. They are but 7 years apart in real life - she should not be playing matronly figures just yet.The screenplay is superb, the directing divine. Charming adaptation!"
5,Emma,I felt it followed the book. It gave my son greater understanding to the book. It was a great addition to our movie collection
5,"The newest Emma, enchanting","My absolute favorite version of Jane Austen's Classic Book. Within the first 30 minutes I'd fallen in love with the characters and the amount of detail from the book. Though events are somewhat out of order, or rather you learn the information about the characters a little out of order, this version is close to perfection. Add in the charming Edmund from Mansfield park, Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley, and who can help wanting to watch this mini series over and over. Well done!"
5,The very best Emma ever,"We have 4 movie versions of Emma: The kate Beckinsale version, the Gwyneth Paltrow version and the 1972 BBC production- and this one. It is head and shoulders best the rest of the lot. Obviuosly you cannot put every detail from the book into the movie- there simply is not enough time. But i thought that the writers did a very good job with what they selected and did not depart from the spirit of Emma- which spirit was channelled very well by Romola Garai in the title role."
2,Meh,"I can't get enough of these types of period dramas, but unfortunately, this portrayal of Emma didn't do anything for me.Romola Garai as Emma was not good. I found her portrayal of Emma as mostly vapid and annoying, although she is certainly beautiful in a luminous way. Johnny Lee Miller was much better as Mr. Knightly. Unfortunately, there was ZERO chemistry between the two of them.Watch the Gwyneth Paltrow Emma-it is much better all around with better acting performances and chemistry between the two main characters. Haven't seen the Kate Beckinsale one; must be better than this one.Makes me appreciate BBC Pride and Prejudice even more when you see how these movies can miss the mark like this one did."
3,not great,"I didn't think this version of 'Emma' nearly so good as the one starring Gwyneth Paltrow. The problem, for me, lay in the casting of Emma herself. The actress portrays her a bit like a first year undergrad. just arrived at college...all excitement, gossip, giggliness, and (to my mind) lacking a little depth. She also looks like a first year undergrad. just arrived at college! Lacking grace and poise. For me, Emma is far more self-assured and haughty, and I think Paltrow captures her character far better. I was also not in love with Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley, though he is better cast than Emma, and brings some gravitas to the proceedings. But I didn't really believe in his love for her...she's just too irritating (!), unlike the Emma in the book."
4,An entertaining romantic drama,The filled out story was excellent compared to movies. It explains a lot more about the background of Mr Churchill which is necessary and also is good.
3,Emma,"This is not one of the strongest versions of Emma I have ever seen. Still, it is good. There are other versions that I have enjoyed more. One would not go wrong getting this version because it is enjoyable enough. It is just lacking the substance other actresses have brought to the character of Emma."
4,Well Made British Comedy,"This is a very high budget British comedy.It's pretty fun to watch but my wife likes it much more than I do.So far the comedy is centered on ""Emma"" who gets herself into trouble by meddling in other peoples business."
4,One of the best,"I have enjoyed Jane Austen books for over 40 years so I like to see the movies of the books. This version of Emma is one of the better ones. It contains the fun, wit, and charm of the book and stays pretty close to the book's story line (as much as a movie can do)."
1,McGoorty,"I can't imagine anyone wanting to write a book about this man.He was nothing but a vulgar,lazy,lying alcoholic.Half of the things that he says are nothing but B.S.For instance,Chicago police officers murdering suspected gangsters @ black men for 200$ a pop.I could go on @ on but you should get the idea.Save your money.As for me, I am going to line my cats litter box with my copy."
2,The tale of a life wasted,"Danny McGoorty was a gifted pool and billiards player. He was also a lazy, drunk petty thief. He spent his life trying his best to avoid honest work. He took as much as he could get from everyone that crossed his path without ever giving anything back. He died bitter and broke.There, now you don't need to read the book."
4,Pool's Fool,"This book is one of the few biograghy's i've read that had a true voice of the subject. Gritty, smutty, vulgar and incitful.It tells the tale of the wayward life led by one of this country's greatest pool and billiards players, witten from audiotapes by Robert Byrne, Mcgoorty comes to life."
2,"Too slow, too repetitive, too boring","I have listened to the first 4 lessons, and cannot continue. The pace is way too slow. The only thing taught in the first 4 lessons is: ""I can (or cannot) speak Thai"" or ""I am (or am not) from America"" Up front it seems to be promising, given the number of tapes and lessons, but in realty you are no further along by the end of the 4th lesson as you were at the end of the 1st. Save your money, see if there are any other lessons available"
2,"Disappointing, but probably the best you'll find","I did a ton of research on Thai language CDs for my honeymoon last year. I needed a CD-only option, as I was using them on my daily commute. This eliminated most of the audio+computer options like Rosetta Stone. While I learned some basics from these CDs, they weren't worth the time I committed to listening to them. Essentially, almost all of the lessons teach you language that would be helpful if you're an American businessman trying to pick up a local woman in a bar. If that doesn't fit your description, I'd avoid these CDs. If it does fit your description, these would be perfect for you!"
1,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING,"'This program has no further Pimsleur Thai learning programs beyond this. This is the only program for Thai that Pimsleur offers (It is a very basic program). Consequently, when you decide to learn more, you can not use this as a stepping stone to intermediate language level. You will have to go to another language program and start as a beginner. No star rating below 'one' is accepted by this site, so I am forced to give one star, although zero is my desire. You will have wasted not only your money, but your time as well.

1,Bait and switch,"I just wanted to buy 2 German CD's for $9 each friends. I recall opting out for buying the whole course for several hundred dollars, but they sent it anyway. It's that deal where if you don't cancel, they start taking out monthly payments from your bank account. I failed to fully read and follow all the directions, But I'm Very Busy! Still, this is that sneaky policy that gives them monthly access to your bank account. They were mean on the phone. I had to change my bank account. Watch your step if you don't have lots of time to jump thru their sneaky hoops!"
4,A Good Approach to a Tough Language,"My wife and I are preparing for a year-long stay in Bangkok, and this audio program is a great introduction to the Thai language. Having said that, I'm not sure it will be enough; perhaps Pimsleur will someday publish a Part Two..."
3,"Good, not great","I thought the camera work, and angles of some of the footage was tremendous. Being an italian fan, I was not too thrilled that they picked their quarter final game as one of 2 not shown. I purchased film because I thought Pearce Brosnan would add something dynamic to film, instead it sounded as if he was doing play by play for golf- very disappointing."
3,World Cup 2006,"the DVD was not what I expected, some great games were not covered. The interviews are OK."
2,not alot for the champions,"Note to the producers. Usually the people who buy these sorts of things are the winning teams fans who want it for their collection. I mean do the French fans order this to say ""wow remember how we lost in the finals on penality kicks to Italy."" Do the USA fans want to see highlights on how they were eliminated in the first round? No Italian fans are the people who are going to order this. You might want to have some content on their games."
4,Give the film a break!,"I do not own the DVD, saw it last night on HBO, and thought of going online and buying it to watch it with my family, huge Italy fans. Remember this was one whole month of the worlds finest teams playing against each other, so trying to squeeze all that soccer into a 2hr film would definitely result in a lot of things being left out. It was great to re-live those glorious moments for Italy. Although I agree that it would have been pleasing to re-live Brazil's elimination as well. Go Italy!!!"
2,why did they leave out the best stuff in the tournament?,"How can you miss the signature play of the Tournament? Maxi Rodriguez goal of the tournament was no where to be found, instead they spent wayyyyyyyyyyyy to much time on other games. This video was poorly crafted, the narration was slim, and there was too much dead air. I watched all the games, I didn't need to see them again in their entirety. What I needed was a summary of the tournament from the group stage through the elimination rounds. Many elimination games were missed and that was just sad. Fifa should take a hard look at this video and create another disk of highlights to cover the ones that were missed. A prequel is in order.Oh and by the way, I don't need to see EVERY yellow card in the Portugal / Netherlands game. Come on. You guys making this should know better than that."
3,"Meh, it's better than the Reedswain video","Would have liked to have seen more of the goals, Brosnan sleepwalks through the very skimpy and unrevealing commentary.The best Video FIFA ever produced was GOL!, the 1982 World cup summary, with a great commentary by Sean Connery. Would like a DVD of that one!"
3,Cheap but useable,"This is a very lightweight folding table that greats for the occasional picnic or beach trip, but don't expect it to handle too much weight. One negative is the material used for the top - it's a compressed paper or wood laminate that sags when it gets wet. While the top finish resists water, it will not stand up to use in the rain. A all plastic top would be much more durable."
2,A Serial with Mr. Spock,"""Zombies of the Stratosphere"" is one of Republic's last serials, a dying breath of the genre. ""Zombies"" isn't exactly about zombies... despite the title. It's about the evil Martians, led by Leonard Nimoy, who want to blast Earth out of its orbit and replace it with Mars. Only Rocket Man can save the day. It's quite boring, unfortunately. The plot plods dutifully along, and even the Mafia is involved (maybe ""Godfather of the Galaxy"" would've been better) However, it paved the way for long-running science fiction series,like Star Trek, which is now in its eleventh chapter. ""Zombies"" will have you fast asleep. As history, it's interesting. Plot-wise,not so much."
2,SERIALS WERE PRETTY MUCH DEAD WHEN THE 50'S GOT HERE,"THIS IS ONE OF THE MORE MEDIOCRE SERIALS. IN A FINAL ATTEMPT BY REPUBLIC STUDIOS TO REGAIN ITS POPULARITY, THEY RELEASED THIS 12 CHAPTER SERIAL ABOUT A MARTIAN [LEONARD NIMOY, IN HIS FIRST ROLE] WHO EMPLOYS TWO GANGSTERS TO BUILD AN ATOMIC BOMB SO HE CAN BLOW UP THE EARTH AND IT'S UP TO AN AGENT WITH A ROCKET SUIT TO FLY IN AND INVESTIGATE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. OCCASIONALLY INTERESTING [MAINLY BECAUSE WE GET TO SEE LEONARD NIMOY, PRE-STAR TREK] BUT THE EXCITEMENT WEARS OFF AFTER A WHILE. MOVIE SERIALS HAD ITS TIME [WHICH WAS THE 30'S AND 40'S] AND THEY CAN NEVER BE BOUGHT BACK. AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT THEY'RE ON VIDEO TAPES AND DVDS TODAY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE ME TO SEE."
3,Alice Cooper - 'A Nice Nightmare' (Sony),"Decent compilation of Cooper's better tunes off two of his catalog CD's, '89's 'Trash' and '91's 'Hey Stoopid', plus a cover of Spirit's ""I Got A Line On You"". Pretty much for the really big-time Alice Cooper fans. Great live photo on the cover. Heard some fans ask about (when) the date of cover photo is from. My guess would be either from his 'Raise Your Fist And Yell' or the infamous 'Trash' tour. Wouldn't you say?"
4,"Wow, wrong release date on this CD. Check it out though....","This CD was actually released in 1997. Not just another ""hits"" cd, but one that has a total heavy list of tunes until the last. Also, if you study the track list, it tells another version of Steven's story. Nice touch. I've had it for 2 years and it is a compilation of hits from Coop's Trash, Hey Stupid and Last Temptation CDs. 1-Hey Stupid 2-I Got A Line On You 3-Bad Place Alone 4-Dangerous Tonight 5-Snakebite 6-Poison 7-This Maniac's In Love With You 8-Trash 9-Bed of Nails 10-Lullaby."
1,UGLY!,"This is suppose to be a Wal Mart Exclusive. It's a boring doll, what's so special about it? There too many Zodiac dolls to keep up with. I mean, It's just a doll with a dress with some sign on it. All the Zodiac dolls are basically clones(except for the colour of the skin, hair, and dress) That's it! It's just boring. I don't think it's even a Barbie collector at all. It think it's just a barbie that you take out of the box and play with. BORING!"
5,An interesting discourse on Pessimism,"A collection of Schopenhauer's Essays speaking on the Sufferings of the world, the vanity of existence etc.. He further dwells on subjects like suicide, immortality, education, women, noise, parables... The essay on women would raise some eyebrows today though... Probably just a reminder that reading any philosopher's work requires some understanding of the context of his writings that moulded his views... But hopefully the best of them can rise beyond such petty concerns?"

3,"Watchable, but not the best installment of the series","While it's not a bad movie, The Substitute 4 is the worst of the 4 Substitute movies. One of the main reasons is the film quality. The first 3 movies seemed to have better ""look"" to them and seemed like they could have been shown in a theater. This one looks more like a straight to video release. Some parts of the movie are slow, but it still has enough action to keep you interested.Treat Williams is good as usual. Angie Everhart is OK - but I don't know why she was there, and some of the bad guys are pretty bad actors. The fight scenes are ok - even if they are a little predictable. A ""special effect"" explosion at a dam is pretty funny looking. There's some decent nudity, the classroom fight scene is funny, and a kid falling on some spike at the dam was cool too. The final battle with the bad guy was cheesy - and like the other reviewer said - why would a racist have a asian henchman?! The twist with Everhart is a little unexplainable as well."
3,Up The Academy!...,"SUBSTITUTE 4 has Karl Thomasson (Treat Williams) going undercover as a sub-teacher once more. This time, he's using his unique teaching skills at a military academy w/ a white supremacist problem. A small band of Nazi-types, led by the colonel of the school, are out to cause terror and bring about ""racial purity"". Thankfully, Mr. Thomasson is on the case! He shows the wannabe-gestapo-brats what-for! With guns, explosions, and the most beautiful doctor (Angie Everhart) I've ever seen, S4 is a feast for the action fanatic! Boy howdy!..."
2,the substitute/failure is not an option,"I bought this one only to complete the ""Substitute"" movie collectionthe substitute 1 to 3 where ok, #4 on the other hand kind of sucks, compared to the other movies. adds up to be a movie that must have run low on money, like an old "" B "" movie. save your money on this one"
2,Substitute 4...Need I Say More?,"Well, here comes the forth and hopfully last in the Substitute series. They should have only made one. This show is not worthy of sequels. I guess that Artisan thought that they could profit off of this series. Don't get me wrong, Treat Williams is a great actor, it's just too bad that he always lands in the straight to video movies. (Everwood may take up a lot of his time now so he won't have to make these types of movies). Angie Everhart's acting is not superb but decent. As for the others, judge that for yourself. The only thing that caught my interest in this movie was the scene between Teague Ted and the girl. The guy who plays Teague Ted is so hot. Being a teen boy having the girl in this movie was nice to see too."
2,Where's Tom Berenger?,"Whoa! this Movie was horrible! Wouldnt it make more sense to have Tom Berenger in the movie? Why even make a SUB 4 if he's not in it? Also, besides him not being in it, there were many flaws, Dont get me started"
4,Interesting blend of Native American musical sounds and r&r,"Redbone's music is truly an interesting blending of Native American musical sounds and early 70's rock n roll. ""Come and Get Your Love"" is the most recognizable cut on the CD but a few others received airplay on FM stations when originally released. Overall, a fine rock album."
4,Perhaps the finest overview of Charles Ponzi!,"To understand the Ponzi scheme, is to understand the basic root of all types of [cheating]. This book gives a wonderful overview of the life and times of Charles Ponzi. It is written as a historical novel, but seems to be very well researched! The epilogue alone is full of details concerning an important subject about whom little has been written. I only wish the book was footnoted as to references. Donald Dunn has done history a great service by documenting the life of Mr. Ponzi. THIS BOOK IS A ""FUN READ"" ABOUT A SERIOUS HISTORICAL EVENT!"
5,excellent true crime story,"Great story of Charles Ponzi. You really get into his mind and get a feel for what this man was thinking. Pretty amazing that he was able to go on for as long as he did when you think that most people would have given up with any of the good reasons he had to do just that. Leaning about this kind of attitude is something that will help anybody in business, even legal business. :) Lots of lessons to be learned from this man, mostly of what to avoid when in your business career. Ego, greed, selfishness, charity, work ethic, etc. It's all here."
3,"OK, But Digital Underground is better",I liked this CD but I liked him better with Digital Underground. This CD is a little more hardcore instead of a fun dance jam.
1,Diasappointed again,"I bought this score to study Servilia's aria and her duet with Annio, but they are written on a clef I've never seen before. I've found that the German publisher, Barenreiter seems to be the best publications for opera scores. However, they are only in Italian and German. They are worth spending the extra money."
1,Ugh. What is with this format?,"Man, I love this show. I haven't seen it in such a long time, but it's still up there in my five favorite cartoons of all time. Which is why I'm very upset with the manner in which these episodes were released on DVD. I mean, really. What IS this? Is it so much to ask for this show to be released by season as most shows are, with complete theme song and credits for each episode and no editing? Jeez. I realize it's neither the most brilliant nor the most popular television program ever conceived, but c'mon, DVD people, throw us JCA fans a bone here! Everyone else is doing it right. Surely a regular DVD release is not so much to ask?"
3,You'll never know . . .,"Here's the thing I want you to know . . . I enjoy the cartoon. I think the series is pretty good. It's good a pretty good basis for an ongoing story. The characters and enjoyed - the heroes are likeable and the villains are believable. However, Columbia/Tri-Star never finished putting out the series on DVD. So, you'll never know how the series ends if you stick to picking it up on DVD. Sure you can catch reruns on Fox and Cartoon Network, or figures out good triumphs over evil. But, just wanted you to know . . ."
1,Needs moar!,"I rated one star not for the show itself, but for this DVD and the few others that were released. These DVDs are missing a few minutes, often the teasers before the theme song comes on. I am also befuddled at the lack of a complete season or series set.It would be so awesome if a series boxed set was released, with each and every minute of the show accounted for, and the Ask Jackie bits as well. I'm not sure why the quality of these DVDs are so poor, or why only a couple were ever released."
5,CHANS THE MAN!!!,WE REALLY DO FEEL LIKE CHAN IS A LIVE ACTION CARTOON & NOT HUMAN! HE'S SUCH A REAL LIVE WOW! WE R SO THRILLED TO HAVE HIS SERIES OF CARTOONS!WE ALL ENJOY WATCHING THEM TOGETHER.... GRANDAMA MOM DAD & THE BOYS!AND WE SO LOVE GRANDFATHER..... ONE MORE T H I N G!!! FAMILY FAVORITE!
1,"Great songs, poorly presented","There are some great Jimmy Cliff classics on this album, but I didn't know he'd ever recorded such poor versions of them. A complete waste of money. Just incredibly overproduced. Track 1 is especially disgusting. Jimmy Cliff fans will NOT be pleased. Save your money. Get the soundtrack for The Harder They Come instead."
5,Dude! This book is awesome!,"Wow!! California has been analyzed and humorized in this delightful book that will keep you laughing from beginning to end. Mr. Marais doesn't miss a beat as he rattles off one quip after another about this culture of characters that even Hollywood couldn't dream up! From pampered pooches to personal growth weekends, from smog alerts to freeway traffic jams, California has set itself up for this author's hilarious take on the ""sunshine state"". Enjoy!!"
1,A poor idea.,"I found this book to be a very poor refernece, full of factual errors, slanted writing, and other offences against good history. The section near the beginning where the author bemoaned the hardships endured by the Spanish in reaching the Aztec capitol, and praised their preservation of conquored peoples, was particularly shocking. I found it extremely ironic, considering the Spaniards suffered light casualties due to travel and fights along the way to whipe out better than a third of the population of the capitol city and almost completely destroy the Aztec culture. All told, I would say a good encyclopedia would provide a better view of the Aztec Empire than this book."
4,Action packed sword and sorcery,"Sword Play, the first volume in the Netheril Trilogy, is a fast-packed, hack and slash, sword and sorcery tale. The book immediately jumps into the action and continues almost non-stop throughout the book. There is an extended lull about a third of the way through the book which lasted a bit too long -- hence my rating of four stars instead of five.After the lull ends, the action starts again with the meeting with the One King and his task to Sunbright, the barbarian main character. The basis for the story is two wizards placing a bet on the barbarian's survival. Eventually, the bet comes back to haunt them and they, in addition to Sunbright and his newfound companion Greenwillow, must try to right the wrongs caused by the bet.Creatures abound in this one -- dragons, pit fiends, hordes of Nine Hells creatures, etc. It's a fun read, but don't look for much character development. Although the trilogy is now out-of-print, copies can still be found ..."
4,Good Read,"This was an entertaining book that I would read again. I felt that the only real draw backs came in the lack of information about the land and people that the story takes place in. A little more background information would have been nice. Also, what kind of a name is ""Sunbright Steelshanks"" for a barbarian? Shouldn't the name be more gutteral? Sunbright sounds like the name of a preistess of sune or some such thing. If you can get passed the name of the hero, and the general feeling of not really being familiar with the land it takes place in, then you will enjoy this book."
4,A good Book,Clayton Emery realy gets into the charicters. A book filled with action and suspense leaving you anxious to turn the page and see whats next. If you would like to talk to me E-mail me.
3,Not Bad,"It was better than the novels of poor authors like Greenwood. In other words, every single female in the book didn't end up naked and the heros weren't invicible.It was worse than the novels of great authors like Salvatore and Niles. That doesn't mean it was a bad novel. There were some enjoyable parts but overall Sword Play was mediocre."
2,Not even good enough for a 3 year old,"We bought this as a gift for a child who didn't have Christmas presents, and she actually asked for something much higher end, so we gave it to my 3-year old so she could take her own pictures and leave our camera alone.The picture quality is about as bad as you would expect. You would be much better off getting a 35mm with film than using this. Every time the batteries come out, whether they run out which happens quickly or fall out which happens easily, you lose all the memory.The inclusion of software was nice, but cheap and not as good an much of the freeware out there. I would suggest downloading Google's Picasa if you would like a good free picture filing and editing program.All in all, I didn't want to waste the money to ship this back, but I should have."
1,High School Orchestra,"Save your money, the performances are mediocre at best. The string section sounds muddy and cannot keep time. The recording seems to be done by amateurs."
4,"If you climb, this movie is for you!","This movie is a classic and a great one to watch if you are a climber. If you teach climbing or outdoor skills, it it great to use for staff training. the plot is OK, but brings about many conversations about human nature and family ties. I highly recommend it!"
3,Mountain Madness,"If you enjoy action movies that slowly build to an exciting climax you will enjoy this one. Spencer Tracy as the older brother was a bit old to play the older brother to Robert Wagner but I guess they felt the younger brother needed to be much younger and irresponsible. As for Tracy's feat of strength, people in stressful situations get the adrenaline flowing and can do some incredible things. You have to be strong to endure that type of climbing. This movie takes place on a mountain where the two brothers go to see if there are survivors to a plane crash. Tracy's intentions are pure of heart while Wagner's are of looting. The turmoil between the two and the treacherous mountain terrain make it a movie that will draw you into this well made drama."
2,Too Improbable,"This movie isn't really that bad, but there are too many improbable and doubtful aspects in it. For one thing Tracey plays Wagner's brother, although he looks more like his granfather (when this film was made Wagner was 26 and Tracey was 56 and looked 20 years older). Also, the feats of physical endurance are so overdone to seem almost ludicrous, even for a nineteen fifties film. The ending was OK, but I couldn't figure out why Tracey's character would bother claiming the looting of the airplane as his doing to save his brother's reputation (since they were the only two up on the mountain he could have just not mentioned it at all). But despite all these faults, the movie isn't that bad. But not one of Tracey's better films."
5,Easy to use!,I can finally understand electronic theory! This is the best way ever to actually understand what is going on in an electronic circuit. Whereas before i was only able to board swap; i can now troubleshoot down to a component level! Just fantastic! Six stars!
3,List and NSDAP,"For misinformed poeple, this book has no direct relation to National Socialism and its doctrines. Guido von List has definetely been demonized by modern propaganda and subjective historians. The Secret of The Runes has little to do with National Socialism, and for those who expect a clear connection, with List being the monstruous, unsrpululous racist-nationalist as he is usually presented, it will be a disappointment. However, I still recommend it to anyone who holds an interest in the occult aspects of the Third Reich and Occult Organizations in the German speaking lands in post-World War I Europe. It is, after all, a question of interpretation. It may prove informative and of special interest to students of the roots of Nazi ideology and symbolism after reading Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke's ""The Occult Roots Of Nazism""."
2,Von List was a fraud,"As a piece of history, The Secret of the Runes is a fine addition to anyone's library on the runes. As a good source of information on the runes of the ancient Germanic peoples it is a total flop.Von List made much of his interpretations of the meanings of the runes out of whole cloth. He lists eighteen runes as his futhork (which we know never existed before his writings) based on the eighteen runic formulas within the Havamal. As we have discovered since (and was probably known in his time) these eighteen stanzas in the Havamal are not associated to just one rune, but to a series of ""bind-rune.""If you are looking for a piece of history, I highly recomend this book. Otherwise, get one of the books by Edred Thorson or Freya Aswinn."
1,BICYCLE SOLITAIRE Windows 95,The CD received was obsolete by 15 years and won't run on Windows 7.The box liner states that it is for Windows 3.1 or Windows 95.Windows 95 is 15 years old. The Amazon sales web page did'tlist any Windows versions for this product.This is a good program when run on a very old computer.
3,The color is great the top is bad!,"I recently purchased this product and I love the color of the blush it is great. But the top to get in the product sucks. It is so hard to get the top off I almost regret getting it. The packaging is so important because I am a freelance makeup artist and I need to get in and out of my makeup with ease. This blush is very hard to get into, which slows me down. So, I love the color but hate the packaging."
3,a decent bike,"I got this as a gift for my partner and she likes it. I test drove it and it works pretty well. It was fairly easy to put together although I needed to take it to a bike shop to get the brakes adjusted correctly. My only criticism is that the gear shifter is a bit weird and clunky and it's easy to get caught between gears as you're riding causing the bike to make a slight grinding sound. This is because it uses a twist adjuster so it's hard to gauge what gears you are on without looking down to see the number display. Of course as you are cruising through traffic this is not recommended! I may be old-fashioned or just haven't gotten used to it yet, but I prefer the traditional up-down push gears - you can tell where you are by feel. But it rides smoothly otherwise."
4,"Real good bike for the money and good looking, too!","It is a very comfortable riding bike. Unfortunately, it did require a bit more ""putting together"" than I thought, but fortunately, my husband is very handy. It rides well and I would recommend it to others looking for a comfort bike."
4,"Low price, all parts worked.","If you are looking for a high quality vehicle this may not be it. Nevertheless, for the price, it is hard to beat this Chinese manufactured bike. My daughter is 11 years old. She'll destroy anything I give her in a few years. She likes the color.All of the parts fit together. The kickstand is useless.Shipping was fast - and just before XMas."
4,Very good bike for the money,"Gears are somewhat difficult to tweak in and stay in adjustment. Lady friend said it was a nice bike but doesn't like the gear shifting,"
5,very nice,"this price can get a bike like this is incredible.....tthere is a very tiny problem is the tire is not a perfect circle when we see it from top.... anyway, it is a nice product and can ride very well"
2,Kent Sierra Women's Bike,I too bought this bike and have had problems with the chugging of gears. My husband had to adjust the brakes a lot so that they wouldn't rub on the tires. I'm not impressed with the quality of this bike and am sending it back tomorrow. I will buy from Dicks sporting goods where I'm sure the quality will be a lot better.
2,Tires bad,The tubes of the bike tires were all bad and I purchased two of these bikes. Both bikes are brand new and yet I have to go to the store and replace all of the tubes on two brand new bikes. Not happy at all with this.
3,Brakes took me 2 hours to adjust....,"Bike seems like a good quality item, but I was dissapointed by how poorly the brakes were put together. I had to completely disassemble them and rebuild them in order to get them to work properly. Both the front and back V brakes has 1 side that was not releasing properly, and the tension was completely off. I removed them to find that the factory had scewed up the installation by not putting a small aluminum spring into the properly place. Once I corrected the issue, the brakes seem to function OK. I don't understand why in this day and age you buy a bike that takes you 2 hours to adjust the brakes on!?! There is no way a normal person could have handled this, and it would have required a trip to a bicycle shop and probably a $100 service bill. Thankfully I'm a handy guy, and know my way around the garage and my tool box! Wife likes the look and feel of the bike, and the seat so far. I liked the fair price for a good brand name."
5,You Gotta Get a Gray Card!!!,"After having had a cereer as a photographer, my advice is for anyone who wants to end up with ""bang on"" exposures,,, get yourself a pack of those cards. It's really the only way to GUARANTEE the correctness of your exposure. Using them is both easy and fast.Do yourself a favour! You'll be glad you did!..."
4,A very basic itroduction to Dianic Wicca,This booklet is a very basic introduction to Dianic Wicca. If you know anything about Wicca it will probably be no use to you personally. I think what it might be good for is to lend out to others who are curious or apprehensive about what you practice. There is nothing wrong with this booklet--its just that it is very basic.
5,Great for any collector!,"I bought this simply because I collect everything 'Britney'. So I think this is an awesome single to have. The bonus remix of Born to Make You Happy is the coolest remix of it ever! I love this, and is worth having."
4,Nice reference!,"I really like this book, especially the long entries. Wish all the references were long ones. Informative, historical, practical."
5,Very Pleased!,"This was shipped so quickly and as soon as I received it, I started reading!! It covers everything you want to know about oils and ailments!! I'll be reading this over and over!! It's a great book!"
5,A Helpful Guide,"As a neophyte to the area of aromotherapy, I found Aromatherapy An A-Z helpful in giving general information. I was encouraged to look further for more in depth information, but I appreciated the book as a starting point."
4,good info,good info easy to retain. I like the history and explanations of what and how things work. recipes are great
5,Definitely the most comprehensive aromatherapy book yet!,"Aromatherapy: An A-Z is a comprehensive guide to the therapeutic use of essential oils and herbal remedies. Patricia Davis has compiled a vast amount of medical, pharmaceutical, and scientific knowledge into an organized, fascinating, easy-to-understand guidebook. Her expertise as an aromatherapist is reflected in her introduction to essential oils and various natural healing methods and procedures. The historical origins and traditions of healing herbs are presented with recent scientific findings of their properties and chemistry to make this book truly the most comprehensive guide to aromatherapy yet."
5,A wonderful reference book!,This is one of the first Aromatherapy books I bought and use it constantly. This is a great book when you want more than just a few lines about a certain oil. The formulas/recipes in the back of the book are wonderful too. I recommend this book to anyone interested in aromatherapy...beginners and pro's!
4,great stuff,"i borrowed this book from the library (before i bought it!) and it was a good read. It is thorough, well presented, and has enough recipes to get you started. You are steered on the right path in terms of oils that you should be cautious with ( which is a far cry from the recipes that you get on the 'net that just throws out any oil/herb combination without telling you the risks). For a starter aromatherapist, i can truly say that i do feel confident with the products that i make for myself and my family. It is really worth the price and more. You will find yourself reaching for it over and over again.The reason why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the illustrations could have been more oraganized, and more attractively done. It may sound like splitting hairs, but if you tried to use the illustrations as a guide for plants for infused oils, you may be disappointed."
2,The Most (Un)comprehensive Guide,"This is far from ""the most comprehensive guide"", indeed every entry suggests ""massage by a caring therapist"" or adding essentials oils to bathwater; the whole book could have been edited down to about 50 pages. The entries for the various afflictions suggest upwards of 5 or 10 different oils can be used, but then never offers suggestions for the instances in which they may be used. For example, under ""Anxiety"", she says ""The personal choice [of essential oil] of a person you want to help is often very revealing."" Huh? In what way? Who knows, she never tells us why. I never made it out of the ""A""s (the section on Arthritis is so full of medical misinformation that I finally just put it down and walked away). Save your money and get something better; I wish I had."
2,pure stupidity,"Well i could kick myself for buying such garbage. Having just enjoyed Erotic sound effects, I thought this would be just as good but I was wrong. The woman in this one is annoying to no end and there is no variety whatsoever. Its just her, moaning and groaning and giggling; give me a break; Some nonsexual tracks are so redundant I don't even know why they included them. One or two tracks were okay but I can only take so much of the same thing over and over again; People who make such CDs can do so much more with sounds and settings but they always seem to fall back on cliches; Is there no imagination left? I wish Erotic sound effects would put out a second disk; if you want erotic audio that will give you a jolt, buy that one. Don't even get this one for a laugh. END"
3,"Charming, But a Slow Read","I fell in love with the voice of Sally Jay Gorce from page one. I loved her whimsy and sarcasm instantly. However, the book was a slow read for me. While I enjoyed her exploits in Paris -- drinking, carousing, losing her laundry, and attempting to become an actress -- I found I could only read the novel in installments of 10 to 15 pages. Sally's day-to-day routine felt repetitive to me, and I often found myself putting the book down and reading another book in its entirety before picking up The Dud Avocado for another ten pages. Ultimately, I liked Sally Jay enough to finish reading the book, but it was slow going due to the repetition."
2,"Starts off promising, but tapers off...","In ""The Dud Avocado,"" protagonist Sally Jay Gorce is reminiscent of Holly Golightly in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" Sally Jay is an American girl who sets out to conquer Paris in the 1950's. The book contains funny stories about Sally Jay's romantic encounters, experience with alcohol, and general misadventures. Although the novel contains some amusing anecdotes, the material is rather dated, and after a while the story felt like it was dragging on and on and ON. I cannot in good conscience recommend this book."
4,Romp of a book,"I don't know how else to describe this book except as a delightful little romp into 1950's expat Paris. With a personable narrator, and roughly drawn characters you feel that, while perhaps a bit contrived and self-conscious, you have dropped into someone's diary of younger years. The flavor of the language is definitely dated, but in a good way, one that brings back a sound that was bound by time and location, not just generation. This voice is just right for a story focused on the moment, that very moment, something that is almost impossible to do in today's world in which everything is overcast with the impending future. What a refreshing existence--even if it only lasts for the length of the book."
2,Must admit I never finished it.,"I just couln't do it; I couldn't finish this book. I was not captivated by any of the characters and just had to move on to greener pastures when I was nearly three quarters through it. There is scene near the beginning of the book where the main character is having a conversation with a potential lover in an outdoor cafe. Their weird conversation set the tone for the rest of book (or up until the point I stopped reading).I think if you get through the first forty to fifty pages and want to continue, then you are heartier than I."
3,See Paris and Die,"As others have stated, not quite the lighthearted romp I was expecting. An honest account of a naive American girl wanting to taste the bohemian life in Paris.Wanting to be ""free"" leads her to make a lot of mistakes. She isn't the first and she won't be the last. But it almost turns ugly when amour proves deceiving. More of a cautionary tale than the funny read you may be expecting."
3,50's-esque Carrie Bradshaw?,"Like a few other readers, I really wanted to like this book. A 50's-esque Carrie Bradshaw was in my mind when I first picked up the book - more of an annoying Holygolightly...I suppose I can understand why this book made (makes) such a splash - it just wasn't for me."
3,Whats the big deal?,I never identified with this book... as a 20something I didn't find the story to be engaging or something I could relate to... it literally took months to read because I kept finding better things to read and just not getting back to it. Maybe it's a great book for you but I've got better things on my reading list.
2,"amusing, yet tiresome","Sally Jay's self-absorpion and constant over analyzing frequently reminds me of Carrie Bradshaw. While this book does have its moments, it doesn't have the interesting palette of characters for Sally Jay to interact with that ""Sex in the City"" did. She grew tiresome to me, and I didn't care about her, so I did not finish the book."
2,Oh how DARLING,"It was just so...I could actually hear the sweeping 1960ish musical romance score in the narrative. I kept thinking ""Gidget."" And sometimes ""Bridget Jones."" And there are a lot of people who like that sort of thing, and so they'd probably like this.I hate books where it is early established that the heroine is a silly darling and the romantic interest is going to tease her about it. Tee hee."
1,Annoying character and story,"The story is narrated by Sally Jay Groce, a spoiled, young American girl on her own in Paris in the fifties who falls in love constantly, has affairs without remorse, and is just too, too bored with it all. She's completely self-centered and shallow, can't be bothered to think of tomorrow, and is happily living off her rich uncle's hefty allowance.I enjoyed the first third of the book when I found Sally Jay's silly and immoral lifestyle somewhat interesting, but as the book wore on, it became a chore to finish. She's a pretty unlikable (if not odious) character, sounding more like forty or fifty than twenty, and the way she just floats from adventure to adventure seemed not only irresponsible and pointless, but sad.I can assume this was quite shocking when it was published in 1958, but by now it's all been done before and better by the likes of Bridget Jones. I found ""Dud"" relentlessly tedious."
2,Superficial attempt at wit,"Excited to read a book from an under-represented member of the ""Beat Generation"", I plowed into The Dud Avacado with relish.... and was sorely disappointed. Unlike contemporary Kerouac's On the Road, The Dud Avocado sadly lacks spiritual, moral, or intellectual development. The primary character starts out as superficial, vain, and unbelievably gullible. Unfortunately, though she miraculously scrapes through disasters of her own creation, she never grows as a person.I too was twenty once and I too did many stupid things. But, I'm really not interested in reading about somebody else's ignorance. Stupid is as stupid does."
5,A Smart Hot Mess of a Girl and Novel,"I am very thankful to have had a chance to read this classic from 1958. This novel is truly entertaining and clearly way ahead of it's time with its insight to the modern woman. Could Sally Jay Gorce be the original Holly Golightly? Read this book, you will forget it was almost 40 years ago as you are sucked into heroine (should that be the correct term for this modern feminist classic) Sally Jay's life. She is a smart, hot mess."
4,Revival Rejoice,"Thanks to The New York Review of Books, this relevant gem has been revived.The ageless battle of Yin and Yang in a feminine framework is pleasantly portrayed by the author."
4,Great read!,"I am glad that The Dud Avocado has hit the popularity mark again, if it ever lost it. This was a very fun read, and I was tempted to start over from the beginning the second I read the last word. I will definitely be reading it again soon. I would go into specifics about what I like about the book, but there's so much great stuff, and I am known to go on forever about these things. So, rather than give a detailed description, I would just highly recommend others to read it for themselves. This book does not disappoint!"
4,Finally!,"I don't want to date my mother, but I remember her telling me about this book ages ago. Growing up, my mother was a stickler for books such as this and The Best of Everything and The Group. I remember digging into this book as a girl and finding myself drawn into a world that at such a young age I couldn't relate. But I so wanted to. The main character had such a 'pop' to her that she was instantly relatable, and as I got older, I never forgot this book. Sure, it's dated, but navigating a world of cads and cruel streets never go out of style when it is well written and has great bite to it, The Bell Jar is a shinning example of that.The Dud Avocado is a little more poignant to me now, and a lot more ripe."
2,A relic of the 50's,"I wanted to like this book--travel, romance, a light-hearted, liberated American girl--what's not to like? But it wore me down fast. I just didn't find the image of a young, very hung over American girl stumbling about in Paris ""the morning after"" in a bedraggled evening dress very funny. Our heroine, Sally Jay Gorce, is totally clueless in a sad sort of way. And although I suspect her flip dismissal of a near-rape is a relic of the time, I just couldn't pass over it as lightly as she did. I have to admit that I got 80% through this book and then just couldn't pick it up again. I can't recommend it."
3,NOT FOR GUYS,"First of all, I think I should apologize for being so tardy with this review, but this was one book that was really tough for me to read. It wasn't tough because it was difficult but simply because it held absolutely no interest for me. Do believe it is not at all a guy book.The story of the young woman going to Paris in order to really live seemed inane, and her doings there (such as wearing an evening gown to go out in the morning)plain silly.I gave it to my wife to read and she really enjoyed it. But, since this is my review - that's the way it was for me."
2,This was a sleeper for me...,"So, how do I write a less-than-stellar review for a book that appears to enjoy so much critical acclaim? I read only about 30 pages before boredom forced me to give up. If I were to describe the book in a single word, the word would be ""trite.""Sorry..."
1,Just a Dud,"I know that this book is supposed to be some sort of cult classic, but I am not sure why. I just couldn't get into it. Normally, I like any book that takes an American to another country and then details his or her adventures. I like to live vicariously through these travelers, fictional or real. However, Sally Jay annoyed me from the start. It is hard to enjoy a book when you cannot relate to the main character."
2,Maybe just too old?,"Dull. Insipid. Unfunny. Hard to believe this was ever the way people acted or thought. And I'm 60, so it's not like I can't remember the era."
3,Terribly trite.,"Where to start?The annoying 'heroine' that was touted as funny, but was anything but?The lukewarm writing, that was easy enough to read but insanely lackluster?The plot that was paced to keep you moving in place for the 255 pages?Or maybe at the ending that was, well, unbelievable?Choose one, though no matter because each questions answer is the same, there is a reason it keeps quietly disappearing.I just can't rate this book higher than a three... and thats on the high side already.Really this book was a dud for me.Nothing new or innovative, especially not now."
5,quite a character - a fun book,"I had a great time reading ""The Dud Avocado.""Sally Jay Gorce, the heroine, is an exuberant, irresponsible, somewhat flaky nut with quite a story to tell about her adventures in Paris. There were times that I cringed at her poor choices, crazy risk-taking, and self-indulgent behavior. I was also thrown for a loop by a plot twist/character development towards the end of the book.However, Sally Jay is likable and the conversational style of the book keeps the tone light and fun.I looked forward to picking it up every chance I got. By the time I was two-thirds through, I couldn't put it down and read through the wee hours of the night until I reached the ending.It was a very entertaining read, and I'm glad it's back in print."
3,not my cup of tea,"I have read a lot of really positive reviews about this book, however, I had a hard time getting through it. It just didn't grab me and hold on. Maybe I'm too old for a book about coming of age in Paris. I didn't laugh out loud as others have said they did. I kept waiting for the hilarious parts, but I'm sorry, I didn't find them. It was humorous in places but also kinda sad. It was well written. Just not my cup of tea."
2,Just didn't capture my attention,"I tried to read this book several times over the last two years, leaving it beside my bedside. Yet I could never get past the first twenty pages or so. In many ways, for a ""classic,"" it is very much a contemporary novel: told in first person, more about character and place than plot, self-absorbed. Unfortunately, all three of those are things that make a novel less interesting for me personally.The basic premise is following a young, idealistic American girl in Paris in the mid-20th century. You may find this more your cup of tea if (a) you are a young, idealistic American girl or (b) you are interested in a picture of Europe in the middle of last century."
4,Funny and poignant,"This is one of those books that at first seems like it will be horribly dated. We've read it all before, and seen the movie too. Another story about a young woman coming into her own? But the prose is crisp and enjoyable, there is no over-sentimentalizing. Just quick wit. Another reviewer compared the author to Hemingway and I think that is apt, though she is more fun to read. The author is brilliant at capturing a setting, and making it real for the reader. The characters are equally well written, existing on multiple levels, with all the complexity humans bring to relationships.Totally enjoyable read."
2,"Amusing, but dated","The Dud Avocado is certainly charming and entertaining, but also trifling. This is a book that belongs to a particular era and style, a period when J.D. Salinger inspired admirers and imitators, or better put authors who found Salinger's vein satisfying and sought to explore it for themselves. Salinger himself can seem slightly dated nowadays, in that his language belongs to a specific period in cultural history, and this book is dated as well, with the added detriment that it is not Salinger. It's not a bad book per se, but rather is a good example of what a young author, having read Salinger, would like to produce in perhaps too great and enthralled response. Enjoyable enough while it lasts, it's quickly forgotten. Perhaps that was the goal?"
1,"A dull, dated dud of a novel","Maybe this was hip when it was first published, but it's very dated now. The stilted prose is hard to read. In addition, the narrator is annoying, shallow and spoiled; she's not the kind of character who can engage a reader in 2012. This should have been allowed to fade away into obscurity--this is not a book that deserved to be re-issued, and I don't think it will find an appreciative audience today."
4,A fun read.,"I enjoyed reading this book. It is a light hearted trip with a young, over-confident,and intelligent young woman who also lacks common sense. It is fun to travel with her across the world. Throw caution into the wind and experience life in youth with freedom. My issues with the book are that 1) the end seems suddenly rushed to tie it all together; 2) The girl did grate on my nerves by about 3/4 into the book and I had an urge to reach into the book and slap her. But that may have been the intent of the author. Overall, it is a good book. Well worth your time. It is fun to read, and the reader easily bonds with the main character. The story flows in a believable fashion. If you want a book to read for entertainment and to experience the complexities of freedom it is well worth the time."
4,Ah...Paris,"The Dud Avocado was a very enjoyable novel filled with imagery of Paris. In reading the well-written book , one could not help but be filled with desire to enjoy that beautiful city. The author does a fine job with character development , as well as providing the reader with a plot-line that is engaging and well thought out."
1,"Not worth the effort, IMHO","I was intrigued by the description of this book. It seemed a bit like Holly Golightly goes to Paris. Since I loved Breakfast at Tiffany's and Paris is one of my favorite cities this seemed to be a perfect book for me.Alas the author is no Capote and the heroine no Miss Golightly. Her ""adventures"" are dull and could have taken place almost anywhere.The book is disjointed and doesn't flow. Despite the quote from Groucho Marx attesting to the humor in the book I found little of it.I tried to finish it 5 times but just couldn't get though it. I know some people love this book but it just doesn't appeal to me at all.The best I can say about this book is that the title is apt. The Dud Advocado is most certainly a dud."
2,DON'T BOTHER READING,"I read only about the 1st third of this tome and was not impressed. This was a few weeks ago and I cannot recall enough of the specifics even to write a decent review. I bought it primarily for my wife who was leaving on an extended trip back to her native Turkey and I did not recommend that she take this with her. As I recall, it just didn't seem to be going anywhere.rbm"
3,Very Hepburn-esque,I found the Dud Avocado to be reminiscent of an Audrey Hepburn movie. I could almost hear her voice when I was reading the pages. It's a pretty good book and a somewhat easy read but I did not find it as humorous as it was purposed to be. It's an OK book that is an easy read.
5,lovehealth!,Love these vitamins. I'm glad I found this one because it's made from real food not like all those over the counter man made vitamins that are advertised on television.
3,Quality issues,"I like this brand, and have used it before. Whether I missed seeing it, or it wasn't clear, the serving size is 2 pills, and I thought it was 1, so thought I was ordering a 4 month supply. I only take 1 anyway. There have been a number of broken pills, so I don't want to take those, so that further reduces the number of pills."
5,Great,"Great Price from Amazon. I installed it on top of an over the rail bed cover (with minor mods) and it works great. I'm unsure about the gas milage increase, but it seems to have some affect. ++++"
4,out if this world,"I bought these for my son, who just happens to have a thing for unique or interesting items. Kinda pricey for a pair of socks, especially since no one really sees them unless he points them out, but he was happy with them and artwork is certainly nicely done."
5,"Excellent, Realistic Guidance for Parents","I found this book interesting to read yet straight to the point. It's as much a good parenting book as a how-to guide for music education. It offers realistic guidelines and specific suggestions for almost every situation, and there's even a section on when (and when not) to quit! I liked the sample pages for getting kids to take responsibility for their own practice time, instead of parents having to nag them. This book has something worthwhile to offer for every level of musical ability, not just aspiring orchestra players, and it is obvious that the authors have in mind not just the ""success"" of the child in music, but the development of the child as a whole person."
1,Don't go near it!,"This embarrassingly awful CD is musical pollution. The most obnoxious of the songs is Jazzman. CK's voice sounds like a siren, for crying out loud! I can't believe people buy this! The woman's voice is so unpleasant to listen to and the lyrics are so childish that hearing it makes you want to crawl under your seat with embarrasment. Carole King has as much musical ability as a boat's whistle. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS TERRIBLE MUSIC!"
5,AWESOME,"Incredible! It is so good, it borders on creepy! Yoda's eyes narrow when he speaks. His posture and hand gestures change as he tells stories. Any Star Wars fan will love it."
2,Um.,"Well. What exactly do you say to this movie? Treat Williams is terrific, I must admit. There's the required reference to Tom Berringer's character in this one, just to have the tie-in. There's the family connection (this keeps up, I'm going to believe that every merc is related somehow to a high-school teacher). It's really a very sequel-sih sequel. Sort of a crayoly copy of the original. It's like, you know how you have those old music files called midis, where the notes to the song are on key but played in that awful synthysized tone? Well, that. The original Substitute was the song; this is the midi.I should have rented it, not bought it. I'm still glad I got to watch it, but unlike the original I'll probably never watch it again."
1,Awful movie,"This was a truly awful sequel. Poor acting, awful action scenes, predictable plot. Very B grade movie. A true waste of money."
2,D+,This new teacher just doesn't cut it.He can't compete to the bad ass that is Tom Berengor.The kids are supposed to be afraid of him?He is not very intimidating.He's to laid back.The sound was also bad in this film.Sometimes I could hardly make out what they were saying and there is no subtitles.The bad guys weren't as good in this one either.B.D. Wong from Law And Order:SVU is in at as a bad guy but it just doesn't work.I think I will skip on part 3 & 4.If you like these type of movies I strongly suggest you watch The Principle with James Bulushi.
4,More High School Hi-jinx!...,"SUBSTITUTE 2 moves the action from Miami FL to NYC. Treat Williams (DEEP RISING) takes over for Tom Berenger, going undercover as a HS sub in order to solve his brother's murder. Once again, we get a classroom full of thuggish psychopaths, out to do anything they can to keep from learning. Of course, the time comes when Williams' character must bring the major discipline! While not as fantastically fun as the original, S2 still has enough gun-play, karate, and sneering punks in it to make me watch it a few times..."
1,A vacuum of the brain,"This movie was so bad that I felt that brain cells were dying every minute that I actually payed attention to it. Horrid acting, from ""who were those guys""? This is a sad sequel to a great first movie."
3,"A hot mess, but it has its moments","This is one of those movies that was supposed to be in the style of Dangerous Minds. The script is not the best, but Treat Williams and B.D. Wong do a good job with what they have to work with. If you like violent, campy films this might be your thing. Lionsgate Films has the entire movie posted on their channel at YouTube if you want to check it out before buying this DVD."
3,SUBSTITUTE 2 Review!,"As is the case in just about every straight-to-video sequel, the original star is out and a newer somewhat lesser known star is in. Treat Williams does the series justice as a mercenary who fills for his slain brother's history class in a mean Brooklyn high school. It wouldn't be a ""Substitute"" film if he wasn't kicking and punching his students through the halls with the help of a few unlikely faculty members. Good straight-to-video fare with a decent cast featuring B.D. Wong, Michael Michelle, Eugene Byrd, and a few others but Angel David taking over Raymond Cruz's ""Joey Six"" role is about easy to believe as Tommy Lee Jones filling in for Billy Dee Williams. Oh wait! Anyways, you get what you pay for."
5,this movie rocks!!!,"Okay, so the movie has a terrible plot, script, and acting (with the exception of Treat Williams and B.D. Wong0. Despite all that, it is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in years. The movie is hysterical when viewed from the proper perspective. If you are able to laugh at this movie because it is sooooo bad, you will thoroughly enjoy it."
5,"Wow, It's About Time!","When I first heard this set was being released I was more than a little ecstatic! This cartoon was a major part of my childhood and helped fuel my lifelong obsession with the character of Spider-Man.After years of bad bootleg copies holding place in my personal collection the price of this set was more than well worth it! I actually paid more for terrible copies than I did for these, which are not necessarily remastered but still ""cleaned up"" just the same. Trust me, they are gorgeous for their age! Season three has a few episodes that leave a little to be desired due to a bad original print, but don't let that detract you from this set. We all know that theme song and now it's available for every collector to enjoy with his or her own children some 35-years later.Enjoy, true believers!"
5,Looking for the Original - This is It!,"This was indeed the Original Spidey from my childhood that I remember.If you remember these original installments on Saturday mornings, you're in luck.They've been digitally remastered, all 52 episodes from 67'-70'.Kudos to Stan Lee and Marvel for putting this out.Great collector's item, and your kids will appreciate the original Spidey.Nick"
2,"Spiderman: please, higher next time, A cartoon show.","Much better than its sequel, Sisterhood of Traveling Pants."
2,Some bloopers to watch out for!,"I loved these cartoons as a kid. A lot were on the Wee Willie Webber show in Philadelphia. As an adult I can see so many flaws. I'll list them for your amusement.1) The store in the opening scenes is first seen as JEWLERY (no typo by me) store...in the next swing by it is spelled correctly as JEWELRY.2) Unless spiderman has several suits and changed them in mid flight there were many errors in continuity. The spider on his back (looks more like a tic) sometimes had six legs, sometimes eight...in some very long shots, 4.The spider on his chest was sometimes the same as on his back, or a more spidery-looking version.3) In many episodes, Spiderman would see trouble at Point A, change into his suit, swing all the way through New York to arrive at Point A again???4) Many scenes were borrowed from other episodes and thrown in making you think you saw that episode before. ex:mole people episodes.I guess this is why cartoons were meant for kids!"
4,COOL,I LIKE WATCHING ALL THE EPISODES BECAUSE I'VE ONLY SEEN A FEW OF THEM! SPIDER-MAN IS SUPER COOL AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE THE 60'S SPIDER-MAN CARTOONS.
4,Appreciating the Arachnid,"I was only familiar with the 60s Spider-Man Series due to its theme. I didn't pick up this set when it was initially released (around the time the 1st Spider-Man movie was released) because at thought it was too corny to watch. As of late, I've become more nostalgic of some animation that aired before my birth, and after viewing a few episodes on [...], I realized this series is not just good for its time, it holds up quite nicely to TV animation of today."
5,"Wolloping Websnappers, this compliation is GREAT!","I love Spider-Man. I love the 60's. I love Ralph Bakshi. I love the music used on this show. The show was cheaply made. The scripts were bad and they reused footage again and again. BUT, this show truly was INSPIRED! Unlike most of the kids shows today, Spider-Man had a unique mood that has never been rivalled."
5,Here Comes the Spider-Man!,"Every Saturday I would wake up at 5 AM just to watch syndicated Spiderman episodes. Some of my best memories of childhood were of tuning in to these classic renditions of Spider-man battles and quietly swinging my fists in unison with those of Spidey, so not to wake my family.And now they are all in a DVD, each leading with the infamous Spider-man theme song. Classic villains such as Doc Ock, Lizard, and Green Goblin make appearances, as well as villains designed solely for the show (for example, Parafino).This is good for long-time Spiderman fans, it is good for family entertainment on those nights where TV has nothing to offer, and for anyone who is big into comics. It is a great example of classic comics come to life; the battle with Mysterio is almost a direct transcript of the two first meeting in Amazing Spider-man. I think it is great."
1,Very Poor Sound,I have the VHS tapes of both of these concerts and the sound from the two DVD discs fell far short of coming anyway near the tape versions. It was a great disapointment.
5,Flashback to the Freaks of the Industry,"Money B and Shock G of Digital Underground fame have done it again. Do you remember the ""Freaks of the Industry"", well this song will put you in the same frame of mind. It will have you attempting things you only see in those adult movies, and of course you will be stopping and rewinding to make sure not to miss a beat or skip a word. My hats off to the nastiest men in the rap game."
4,cool watch,"i like the watch....I will exchange it for a pink one though because I cannot see the numbers and the hands because the orange face is too dark, and the hands and numbers are lost in the background to my old eyes. otherwise I like the watch!"
3,Dented,All of the edges have dents in them exposing the wood; i kinda expected better for a $15 item rather than a $2 one but it still holds pens and pencils
5,A MUST HAVE,THIS IS THE COOLEST ACCESSORY I PURCHASED. I'M ALWAYS USING IT. THE HARDWARE COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT MORE LUXURIOUS BUT A FABULOUS FIND NEVER THE LESS. I WOULD NOT TAKE ANYTHING FOR IT. IT'S LIKE STRIKING GOLD FOR ANYONE INTERESTED ON DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY.
3,Not nearly as good as usual,"This installment of the series had my interest up until the end...and then it just fell apart. It was too pat and convenient, without Desiree having to do any legwork or dig for the truth. Add that to the fact that we never found out the resolution to the ""sub-mystery,"" and I finished this book feeling really disappointed, which doesn't usually happen with Desiree."
5,Saved me in class,Great book! It breaks down every conflicts topic and makes it much easier to understand than my professor does in class. Good review questions for exams and great analysis of essay topics.
3,Problems with the 9740 Tiger Claw,"The Tiger Claw is a great innovation amongst reciprocating saws and we have tried most of them. The saw has ample power, the problem is the reciprocating shaft, we have had to replace 2 of them with in a 60 day span. We are an Auto Recycling business and yes the saw is operating under cruel curcumstances such as cutting Qtr Panels and other metal parts on cars and trucks. This is where I give the Tiger Claw well earned praise for performance. I agree with the other reviews in that a year from now Porter-Cable will have fixed the problems and will have an awsome portable reciprocating saw."
4,Suprising very good and nice twist at the end...,I'm a big fan of both Petersen and Cole but bought this mainly for William Petersen's role in it. I like the diversity of both characters in roles that they play and knowing from Bio's that they are real life friends there was a chemistry on film with them that was very believable.I expected the film to be more risque and was pleasantly shocked that it was handled very adultly in the adult material content. The end was suprising and more towards the realities of life and how they play out vs. Hollywood's view on people and their lives. I honestly enjoyed it much more than I thought and will watch it again.
4,William Petersen HOT,"If you are looking for a William Petersen movie that will keep your attention- this is it! The movie is really good, but the main reason I think any Petersen fan will buy it, is the hotness of William in this movie! Make more movies like this one Billy!"
2,Billy Petersen Fan,"I really enjoyed this movie because I am a huge Billy Petersen fan. I have watched it several times and my only critisism is that I find myself screaming at the screen, ""Get over yourselves""."
1,Would not recommend,"This movie was awful. I kept watching it because I thought eventually it was going to get better but it never did. The plot: two men abandon their wives and children to find themselves, but really all they are doing is chasing young women in the tropics. They carry on a ""three-some"" relationship with one woman. One guy continues travelling, the other finally goes home to his family but in all his arrogance suggests to his wife she's lucky to have him home for as long as he stays. Do not waste your time - you will wish you had the two hours of your life back."
4,WHAT IS THE NAME OF THAT SONG?,"When I first watched this movie, the introdution song caught my ear. I have been trying my hardest to figure out who does the song, but have had no luck. It is the song that plays while the movie shows all the different masks in the beginning. Can someone please help me figure this one out!?!"
4,Pick a level...and watch it!,"You settle down for a nice evening with a home movie and you note when it is over that you haven't touched your beverage or popcorn, and you may well be sitting on the edge of your chair.In an adventure that begins as an adult/adolescent rebellion against ""acting like a man,"" this story evolves, sometimes gently and sometimes with ferocious leaps, into one of the most spiritual movies you will ever see. The characters are believable. The story involves one of saddness, search, transformation, and reconciliation. The acting is beautiful to behold, and you sense that they really felt what they were portraying. The viewer will feel it too. This movie was recommended to me as being ""very erotic."" It is erotic,in the sense that a life well-lived is erotic, but it is so much more so. An earlier reviewr recommend that this movie be rented and then purchased. That is exactly what we did in my house."
5,Great fantasy video with positive life lessons,"I bought this as pure relaxation, because it has Petersen in it. No disappointment there - his acting is superb. Great fantasy video with positive life lessons as well. Yes, life. And love. And how decisions affect you and those around you."
3,Title Of Review,"Okay, I gave this one 3 stars because it is an Okay EP. Whereas the Superjudge album would get 5 stars, and God Says No 4 stars, for example, you see? Basically, if you are a Monster Magnet fan, you need this EP for Lizard Johnny, Freak Shop USA, and a different version of Nod Scene. The other tracks can be found elsewhere. Lizard Johnny is a very cool track. The overall sound of the EP is similar to Spine Of God and Tab. I don't know why I'm writing this review. Bottom line: this is the one to buy when you've already bought all their other CDs."
5,Awesome game.,"This game is cool. It's a game that's not always easy but once you do the hard parts it's very fun! I'm one the last level(I think)! It's good game. It's very good to play when you're bored or anytime at all! So if you're just looking around for something to buy, this is it."
5,Dragon Warrior Monsters 2 Reveiw,This game rocks personally I think that DWM1 wasn't that good but if their going to add over 100 monsters and another monster class I think it would be the greatest game ever (2nd being DW3)
3,Overpriced for millet seed,"This seed is almost entirely millet and I was expecting something much better for the price. Some birds prefer millet, particularly ground feeders, so they will be happy, but most feeder birds prefer something more substantial, like sunflower seeds. The real advantage of no-mess feed is that the sunflower seeds are hulled, but this feed has so few sunflower seeds, it hardly matters. For the price I paid for 15 lbs, I could have gotten 20 lbs of high quality no-mess at the bird store or three times as much millet seed at the grocery. This seed may be especially fresh or some other advantage not immediately evident and some of the birds will like it, but I don't consider it a good value for the price."
1,NON SPECIFIC,"I bought 30 pounds of this bird seed, because I live in Montana and thedescription said ""for many kinds of birds"" WRONG..of all the birds in my part of Montana...not one bird has eaten one seed! What a waste of money."
4,Very Helpful Manual for Boys Only,"I found this book to be helpful and insightful. After a slow start, Mr. Beausay gives practical advice in recognizing the changes that boys are going through and there inability to express how they feel at a given moment. I found the chapters directed to encouraging them most helpful. I highly recommend this work."
1,"Not a book, a tent revival with exclamation points!!!!!!","Ugh. I don't know where to start. It reads like an informercial. It doesn't really provide advice through serious reflection, it simply makes generalized statements about ""boys being under attack for decades by society"" and then neither backs up the statements or provides solutions. Rather, it punctuates niceties with exclamation points. Lots of them!!!I was looking for a common sense book about raising a teenage boy.I'm still looking."
2,Poor Quality of Assembly,"I bought this unit instead of the Delta, because I didnt like the comments about its light weight construction.So now I have the Heavy weight, and it looks like it will do the job, however. There is a lack of attention to detail in the way things fit together.My biggest gripe is the the alignment hole that the guide plate fits into is not perpendiclar to the belt and the disc.Which means you need to adjust the screws on the bottom of the plate whenever you change from belt to disk.Then the 4 holes for the dust scoop do not align with the 4 threaded mounting holes.In this modern age of CNC machining, one would think this would be a simple task.The unit is made in Tiawan, but smacks of early Chinese lack of quality.So far it has sanded well."
1,you get what you pay for,"I recieved this sander two weeks ago and just had the time today to put it together.Assembly went easy.Started it up and the belt guard was clanging aroud (factory installed). There are two screws that hold it in place. They were loose, tightened them. Restarted still clanging,Upon further examination the bracket was loose inside the cover. removed the cover and disc plate the spot weld did not holdCalled Fisch and guess what they are not open on Fridays. It is a business day.Stay away from Fsch, poor customer service, poor quality control and poor product."
3,Diana deserves better,"This video was much anticipated. I am a big fan of Diana Krall and enjoy all of her CDs. However, the audio on the Live in Paris video falls short. Her vocals and basic band sound ok. However, we can hear ""pumping"" in the orchestral accompaniment and applause tracks, and the low end is pretty much nonexistent. The wonderful bass playing of John Clayton is barely audible; also, there are visuals of instruments (e.g.,wind chimes) whose sound is absent from the mix. Diana is wonderful to see and hear. I'm sorry her effort has been so poorly produced, recorded and mixed. It reaches new lows in the 'Swonderful segment. Diana gets five stars as an outstanding musician. I wonder why her producer, Tommy LiPuma was relegated to associate producer status? His work on her behalf has been on the highest professional and aesthetic levels: he, along with Diana's fans, must be saddened by this undeserving production."
5,Nice company to dinner,Estupendo concierto para disfrutarlo solo o con amigos . Suave y dulce pero no empalagoso. No pense que fuera agustarme tanto. Todo un ejemplo de como debe planearse un buen DVD
1,Disappointed,"Although the video was up to standards, the audio was so substandard that I am seriously thinking of asking for my money back. The strings sound was tinny, the bass was nonexistant, and the precussion sounded like a high school band performance. It was produced by an outfit named Eagle Eye Media. There is no comparison to these tracts to those recorded in a studio. I have some of these songs on other CD's of hers and all I can say is, ""What a difference!"" If I were Diana, I would withdraw this CD from the market and sue Eagle Eye for damage to my reputation.I could never recommend this CD to any one. These guys should be stopped from ever recording another live performance."
5,wow again!,"There is little that I can add here that hasn't already been said on here before.I bought this one after Live At Montreal and as much as I love that one and as much as its hard to compare them,given the differences in material and personel,I would have to give this one a slight edge.The ballads on here are exquiset-I've never heard her sound better.And,to top it all off,after a night of standards,for the encore she leaves us with a gorgeous solo rendition of Joni Mitchell's ""A Case Of You"" It doesn't get any better than this."
5,A Must Have,"Every sane person on this planet should own this DVD. If you like jazz, you'll love this. If you don't like jazz, you will.This dvd is extremely clean, the picture and audio are perfect. Listening to Diana Krall's CD's is one thing, watching her perform is an entirely different and wonderful exprience.Buy this DVD."
5,Wow....a life performance that will let you taste the rain.,This is a great evening if you have a TV with surround sound...it is like being there. Diana is really a treasure...I enjoy her work very much.
5,I am speechless.,"I always liked this type of music, but never really spent time listening to it except for special occasions. One day I did a search for top selling jazz albums and came across this one. After I watched it for the first time, I was taken through emotions I haven't felt for years. I felt like hugging my wife and dancing with her right there in my livingroom! This is purely magical in every sense of the word. Not only are the arrangements stellar, the individual performances will delight the most ardent jazz enthusiasts. I highly reccomend this."
5,It shoud be 50 stars... no wait! 500 stars!,"I received it yesterday, and since it was my birthday, it was one of the best presents I got in my whole life.Looking and listening to it was like being in heaven.Do you a favor and buy this DVD right now!"
5,Great talent and great show!,"Diana Krall plays the kind of jazz that is both energetic and also melodic, moody and sensuous. She has surrounded herself with awesome musicians who complement her playing and vocals wonderfully. She's a great ambassador of jazz and this performance was a masterpiece."
4,Best viewed on a big screen,"I'm pretty new to jazz but this DVD was a great introduction. Diana is in fine form and so are the 'band' I watched this on a 55"" flat panel TV and it was like being there."
5,Diana Krall - One of the Best!,"This production of Diana Krall's live performance in Paris is first-rate. It runs for a long time, and there was never a moment that we thought to stop it to take a break. It is truly awesome. DO NOT miss this one!"
5,Another winner from Canada.,"Diana Krall truly has it all! To say her voice and phrasing, along with a great jazz piano style are outstanding would be the epitome of understatement. This performance of her Paris concert not only is of very high quality, technically, but the tune selection and the musicians that play with her is nothing short of inspiring, to the musician and listener alike."
4,Diana Krall -You've won me!,"I am not really interested in jazz, but this DVD knocked my socks off.Beautifully filmed and recorded, it reveals Ms Krall's great talents as both a vocalist and pianist. Her choice of tunes was appealing, with most of them being old favorites - but presented with silky smooth new arrangements.The whole performance was enhanced by the caliber of her supporting group.Great stuff!"
5,The Best,"I agree with the other reviewer idea of a peek performance here. This is a great DVD and a must-have for anyone with any taste whatsoever. I have all of Diana Kralls CDs including the latest The Girl in the Other Room which was a SEVERE let down. I assume her latest DVD Live at the Montreal Jazz Festival will also be a big let down since she is playing some of those tunes which are obviously something to do with her new husband Elvis the completely different and quite less talented Costello. I do not like to give negative reviews so I will get back to this DVD. I highly recommend this DVD. I think it is, by far, her best work. I am just sad to see her declining. I hope she may again return to be as good as she was here. If you are trying to decide between the other DVD and this one I would say this one has to be the better choice."
3,DTS recording is wrong,"Why does 50% of the piano sound come out of the rear right speaker? Am i supposed to be sitting on Diana's knee?very dissorientating.I think the sounstage has been put on disc wrong, unless its just my disc."
4,It's like being at a concert.,"Overall this movie is excellent and a visual treat, like most reviewers say. I have all of Diana Krall's audio recordings (CD's) and thus cannot help comparing her singing and musical backup with her earlier audios. Musically the audio records are in better form and voice than this live concert. They probably should not be compared however; a live concert movie is an event by itself."
1,Krall is Great - VIdeo on Demand Version of this DVD Isn't,"Had I been paying closer attention, I would have noticed that the amazon video on demand version of this excellent performance was 60 minutes, as opposed to the 130 minute listed running time of the DVD. Which means that I'm missing a lot. Don't make my mistake - get the DVD."
5,Awesome dvd!,I have really enjoyed this dvd. It's like watching a concert over and over. I can't wait to order more music by Diana Krall and other music by some of my favorite artists.
4,It don't mean a thing if it's buried in strings...doowatdoowatdoowat,Big five stars for DK as well as AW and JH....her quintet is just fabulous.But oh how I disliked the syrupy orchestral arrangements and performances of Claus Oberman (sp?) and the European orchestra. It's the antithesis of jazz and there is a lot of it. Cloying sugar water.
5,This puts some BluRay Concerts to Shame,This DVD is simply amazing. I am so glad I own it. I will never get rid of it. This is reference DVD quality. DTS track is to die for.
2,"Not strategy, don't be fooled","Play this game and wonder why your strategies aren't working? It's because this is not a strategy game like it's advertized; it's actually a puzzle game with one, maybe two, solutions to each level and your job is to figure out what the creators thought would be the best way to go about your mission.The computer game was the same way, but at least you had the benefits of a mouse and sharper monitor resolution. Trying to play this game on any television less than an HDTV set is seriously straining on the eyes. The very cruelly-designed action icons are so tiny, and offer no text accompanyment that just figuring them out is half the puzzle. Get the computer version if you REALLY have patience, but don't waste your time on a console version."
2,Great on the PC not so great on the Playstation,I have played several of the Commandos games on the computer and love them.They are challenging and addictive. When I purchased commandos for the playstation I was disappointed. The controls are much more cumbersome and the game play just seems to be slower. I believe the Commandos games are great but I would definitely stick with computer versions.
2,"Whatcha gonna do hen you play this game, THROW IT OUT!!!!!!","This game is so stupid. Yeah the sound is pretty good and the price is low, but guess what.......YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!!!! Too many controls buttons, the enemies are too tough, I mean if you're 1000 yards away BOOM BOOM BOOM oopsie big man get shot(and I'm not talkin about your enemy.) The Graphics stink and this makes it incredibly not fun. If you're a big fan go rent the game before you BUY IT. TRUST ME!!!!!!"
1,The controls are impossible,"This game's premise is good, but the controls make it impossible. It takes hours to just get the controls right and really detracts from the fun of the game. It also would be better if it was a first person strategy/shooter game. Overall, this game has promise but it's destroyed by the controls being too intricate and difficult."
5,Massive change,Excellent vision and unhappy scenarios are show us. How could we do this? It's time to change!Robson Quinello
1,Wrong Serial Key Version,"When I ordered this, I was very excited to work on my school project however, when I received the the disk, I got version 11, but a serial key for version 10. I call Amazon and they said they had no control over that and sent me to the manufacture who CHARGED me another $9.95 to get a serial code for the right version...which...might I add...DIDN'T WORK EITHER. I would steer clear of this product in my own opinion because now I have to buy another product and am out 20+ dollars."
1,Wouldn't buy it again,"I bought this hoping it would provide a nice distraction during my down time (if any) on an upcoming deployment to Afghanistan. However, after installing it, half of the icons were non-viewable without internet assistance and the program as a whole really lacked user-friendliness. I have a master's degree so I'd like to think it's the program and not that I'm a complete idiot! Probaly would not buy this again. On the bright side, I got it cheaper online than if I'd bought it at Best Buy."
1,Very Poor Software,"I bought this software to design a floor plan for a house. When just laying out the walls, its user interface is very crude. I found I had problems placing walls and could not nudge them to the positions I wanted once they touched another wall perpendicular to them. As a result I continually had to delete and redraw. Eventually I started placing objects such as a bathtub or a door. This became a fatal blow to the program. Adding even a couple of objects slows the program down so much that is useless."
4,Natural Slipcover,"I bought this slipcover to dress up my dining room chairs. It fits somewhat well, though it is a tad big in the back. I was slightly disappointed with the color, however. The picture shows the product a bright white. It is much more of an off-white hue than indicated. Still, this is a simple and affordable way to dress up your boring chairs. You won't be dissapointed unless you're looking for a bright white color."
3,Just OK,"The fabric on these chair covers is very thin. The price was so good & I needed something fast. Like most things, you get what you pay for. That being said, it's still better than looking at the stained fabric on my chair seats. These chair covers will do the job until I have the time to have the chairs recovered."
2,The picture does not represent the actual color at all,"I'm sending it back... I ordered the green sweatshirt based on the picture color which I would call a Kelly Green. However, what I got was a dark forest green, almost to the point of being charcoal colored, sweatshirt. Be aware of what your ordering."
4,Good quality,"Sized right...I wear a large 5' 10"" 46 REG. Would give 5 stars if not Made in Mexiconice zipper and hand pockets"
4,solid performing hoodie - be careful about sizing,"Good thick material, seems to be well made, strong zipper, seams etc. Definitely a cut above other brands of basic hoodie. I do think it's worth paying the little bit extra for this if what you want is warmth and comfort from a simple cotton sweatshirt. Carhartt and Dickies both sell other models that are 'thermal lined' and 'pique bonded' - they're good too, having bought one of each for comparison, and they're perhaps even better than this cotton number on the warmth front. But this one is the most comfortable and the thick cotton feels cozy. Watch for sizing though. Don't go off the standard Amazon sizing charts. I'm an Australian, 5'10"", 85 kgs, normally wear Large here but bought medium in the carhartt hoodie and it fits well. A large would be way too big. Even the medium is a touch too long on me (though you get an inch or so shrinkage up on first wash and dry)."
2,too small,"Nothing was wrong with the product. It just didn't fix my camera. I'm back to looking for where I could have put the orginal cable. If don't find it, I going to order the micro-b cable and see if it fix."
1,It was defective...it didn't work.,"This item was priced so low that I didn't even complain about it when it didn't work. It was 3 weeks in yransit from Hoj Kong' I tried it on several devices to no avail, just didn't work."
1,Junk,"First of all, it took over 2 1/2 weeks for the item to arrive from Hong Kong. When it finally did, the packaging was half open. The cord itself was severely damaged, missing large sections of the rubber coating, which had exposed the actual wiring inside. Needless to say, the cord doesn't work and is complete junk."
5,great,"Works perfectly for our applications (a professional studio environment). Good design/construction, built to last. No problems at all connecting this cable to a camera. Will definitely buy more if needed."
4,replacement cable,"Just what I needed; had lost my old cable and this one is working perfectly! now I can charge my cell on the go, using my ipod charger, just switching out the cable. Very convenient and it works like a dream. Thank you!"
2,Doesn't work for all devices,"It's a pretty thin USB cable 1 meter long. I bought it to replace the cable that I have for my external hard drive. Sadly, it didn't work because the cable doesn't provide power or enough power and is mainly used for data transfer. It works for a Western Digital 2.5 inch drive, but I would be wary of using this unless your device has its own power supply.I bought it to use it with the Vantec Nexstar hard drive enclosure on Amazon because their cable is absolutely terrible. It frequently disconnects even when no one is touching it. Anyway, the drive doesn't load up and continually clicks or it freezes after booting Windows. As a result, I need to use their old cable until I can find a replacement.Final note: I would suggest buying a cable with two USB cables at one end or the Y-cables as these are made to provide enough power. A funny thing is that a Western Digital cable with only one end works whereas this cable does not."
5,It works,"Not much to say about this product. It works for what it says it is. Seems a bit on the stiff side to me, but appreciate the free shipping and faster than usual delivery."
5,great for charging ps3 controller,I ordered this after my 3 year old bent our original ps3 controller charger cable. It works perfect. No complaints.
5,Just dandy,Product was just as expected. Works accordingly. I use it to charge PS3 controllers. I purchased 3 and they all work fine.
3,Oops... this doesn't work for Kindle,"I was actually looking for a Kindle 3 USB cable (because I lost it). Kindle actually uses a Micro-B NOT Mini-B. I should've researched a bit more. Either way, the cable is fine. I've need of a Mini-B cable as well, so I'm going to just keep this one."
1,Not working when arrived and wants me to pay postage to return,"Not working when arrived and wants me to pay postage to return, would cost about same to send it back for what I paid not counting what time is worth and the 4.00 in gas haha ,, Owell you get what you pay for!!"
5,Exceeding expectations,The cables are short and more durably built than I expected for such a low price. Ideal for charging of PS3 controllers. Does exactly what I expected of them. No problems to mention.
5,Great Quality Cables,"I was a bit shocked at how well built and solid these cables seemed to be. It seems sort of trivial, but I've had all sorts of cables over the years that eventually stopped working because they'd been crimped one too many times in my travels or just seemed to wear out. These thick, semi-rigid, and I doubt I'll have the same old problems with them."
4,"Works and fits on MacBook Pro 15"" unibody","Excellent product. Works perfectly. Size and profile fit perfectly between my minidisplayport plug and ethernet cable (Macbook Pro 15"" - 2011 model). Price is a little high but a one time only purchase so is OK."
2,Not his best,"I have been a John Waters fan for many years. I thought he could do no wrong until I saw this yawner. The expression ""mailing in your performance"" shouldn't apply to a director, but this film shows none of Waters's usual wit or cheek or in-your-face style. I almost stopped watching halfway through, except I kept hoping for some spark. Disappointed is not a strong enough word."
2,Melanie Griffith RUINS this film,I love John Waters but Melanie Griffith is so bad that she's unwatchable.
5,"A Great and Fun time, watch this movie!","I just want to say that I abosultely LOVED this movie, it was so funny- I am a huge fan of John Waters, anyone who is a fan or not for that matter should really give this film a chance, you may love it you may hate it- I know I loved it!"
3,"Good, but not quite up to snuff for Mr. Waters","Yes, Melanie does a good job of playing a bad Hollywood actress, but it comes natural for her. Some classic John Waters scenes, like the terrorizing scene of the Baltimore Film luncheon, but overall, this film just seemed to drag a little. I would still recommend it if you are a John Waters fan, but the cameo appearance of Mink Stole says something is lacking."
2,technique is nothing more than failed style,"i am easily one of john waters biggest fans and it pains me to say this, ""this is his worst film to date"". many will say that i did not understand this film. trust me i did. i got the jokes and references but it simply does not work. the dialogue is forced and laboured. the characters are not memorable at all and their violent and grotesque deaths were welcomed by me simply to keeep from having to watch them any more. there were many attacks on the city of baltimore and none of the cast seemed as if they wanted to be in this film. i can not blame them. all fans of waters will of course want and will see this but plan for the worst and hope for the best. this film is neither technical nor styled. please mr waters release your former films on dvd. hollywood success has seemed to have squashed your uniqueness."
3,Cecil B. Demented,"I saw the premiere of this movie at the Senator in Baltimore. It's kind of fun. The movie has a fast pace, and is a commentary on the state of modern, mass cinema. It's the most fun when the movie-terrorists go around filming their masterpiece, causing mischief and mayhem. If you're from the Baltimore area, you'll recognize all the locations used in this film. Keep an eye out for Eric Barry, aka Cheezey-E the White Mystery in his first role as the compulsively onanistic Fidget. Yo cheezey, studio pimpin ain't easy!"
1,How do people like this movie,I do not see how there are all of these positive reviews for this movie. It is awful. I do not want to write a lot because what I have to say has been said by others who gave it ONE STAR. Read those one star reviews because those are the reviews that truly show this movie for what it really is.
1,OH NO!!!,"First off I want to start by saying I am a big John Waters fan. Sometimes he may not come up with the best movies but at least they are interesting, that is until this one. I found myself bored stiff watching this and couldn't even make it half way through. Let's hope it is just an abberation. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen"
1,The Worst Movie Ever Made? Perhaps.,"There is nothing to like about this movie. The plot is idiotic, the characters are not even one-dimensional, the acting is low caliber, the soundtrack is like torture, and it is not funny. This is not even a movie you love to hate. This is a movie to simply hate. Picture the result if you were to give a group of not particularly bright high school kids a camera with the instructions to shoot a movie by the end of the week. Then make the movie 100 times worse. That is how bad C.B. Demented is. So is this the worst movie ever made? Only time will tell. As of February 16th, 2001, it most certainly is."
4,"Where's The Hot Brand? I'm 'Demented Forever', too...","....this is hilarious! And Waters is right that Mela G is overall a good sport to be subjected to the Demented Mania. What I dig about C.B.D.: in the ""family film is another word for censorship"" scene how the good mothers throw Jujubies at Demented and crew, how Honey Whitlock's jump from atop the building was shot and edited like a big-time 70's B-moovy (she lands on her feet like a cat), how Cecil reminded me of Depp's Ed Wood, how Waters tossed in Patty Hearst in a story kinda like her own, and how dead on that hilarious ""Gump Again"" sequel business is. To me it looks as if Waters is gonna stay a Hollywood outsider forever. That's okay, I'm digging on his Hollywood East sick cinema...."
4,Renegade Cinema,John Waters knows how to make a film that really gets to the heart of the subject. This film inspires young filmmakers to want to go out and make a movie and tell hollywood to shove it. While the flick is fun the story is unrealistic. I fell that anyone who is tired of standard hollywood movies should see this movie.
3,I kinda liked this.......,"This film spoofs not only hollywood, but the cultists as well. In that respect, I actually found this to be entertaining and funny."
4,THE WILD AND FUNNY NEW JOHN WATERS FILM,"Renegade director Cecil B. Demented (Stephen Dorff), kidnaps Hollywood diva (played to perfection by Melanie Griffith) and forces her to star in his latest masterpiece, along side a cast of lunatic's...a porn star, a junkie, a homosexual limo driver, a not-sure-about his sexuality hairdresser, and a few more loonies...hey this IS a John Waters movie.Battling Hollywood moguls, the police, and the media, Cecil will stop at nothing to finish his ""underground"" movie, and save cinema from the curse of HOLLYWOOD!""Cecil B. Demented"" is John Waters the way we like him...totally crazy! Although, NOT a movie for everyone, those looking for something out of the ordinary will be pleased with this send-up of renegade movie making. A great cast including: Dorff, Griffith, Alicia Witt, Adrian Grenier, and Waters' regulars Ricki Lake, Patricia Hearst, and Mick Stole, add to the fun.Nick Gonnella"
4,Eclectic Appeal...Great for Coffee House discussion,"First off...not everybody will like let alone stand this film. However, its' appeal to the iconclastic crowd is strangely bewitching.I once showed ""Being John Malkovich"" at a Friday gathering when the film was in its' hayday. Many seemed confused as to why the film had garnered such great reviews. Cecil was the follow-up movie of the evening that answered their questions. A fun time discussing it was had by all that night.I can best describe Cecil as a tongue and cheek dark comedy lampooning the movie industry, Hollywood, its' biases and image. The punk, anti-establishmentarian and counterculture fringe element in you should enjoy this feature."
4,I like it,"I like this release by Waters,However, I find this film to be influenced heavily by Street Trash,But I definitley recommend this movie."
1,This movie is one of John waters worst,"This movie was a suprising dissapointment after watching it. I barely cracked a smile through most of it. (Notice its not in his recent ""john waters collection"". Reasoning is because it stinks! His films are slipping with each one coming out. Pecker was awful too, a dirty shame was ok. Check out his earlier movies for some real trashy fun but if you must with this one please rent it first!"
1,What a disappointment,"I am a huge John Waters fan, but this movie does not come close to living up to his usual standards. It seems Waters is trying to balance between mainstream filmmaking for the larger audience appeal, and keep his previous biting cutting-edge. Serial Mom was able to do this -- this movie absolutely failed. It is poorly written, poorly acted (Melanie Griffith a bad actor? Yeah, that's a stretch), and poorly editted.The movie is suppose to be making a statment against Hollywood turning out so much mediocore garbage. This movie is a prime example of the type of garbage that shouldn't be turned out.John Waters' movies are by all means still worth buying and watching, just avoid this one."
1,"Rated ""R"" for Ridiculous","This movie is without question is the stupidest movie on the face of the earth! Besides all of the cussing, crude jokes, and wobbly cameras, this movie has the dumbest plot. ""Outlaw Cinema?!"" What the crap! Do not waste your time or money. THERE IS A REASON THIS MOVIE WENT STRAIGHT TO VIDEO!"
4,Stephen & John Waters Rock!,"Stephen rocks in this movie and that's good to see compared to his latest unsuccessful releases. He's demented and devilishly sexy just the way he needs to be. His portrayal of Cecil will not only have you laughing your head off but you'll find yourself impatient to see what happens next. He leaves the entire cast in the dust except for Alicia Witt who put in an equally interesting and terrific performance as Cecil's pornstar girlfriend Cherish. Stephen brings charm to this role and it will remind his true fans of his role as Deacon Frost in terms of sexuality and creativity. Stephen is a gifted actor and though Cecil B. Demented isn't the best movie at times, it's Cecil himself that carries it along. Definitely the best John Waters flick too and I definitely think Stephen and John should reunite in the future. Suffer for Celluloid!"
3,Not the worst John Waters movie...,"[...] It's very interesting and funny to hear him reminisce about the old days, and also to know about some of the scenes where some of the old ""Dreamlanders"" made cameos.I only gave this 3 stars because there is more than the usual amount of corny gags as compared to other John Waters movies. There is a passe scene where the heterosexual hairdresser laments his heterosexuality....PUHLEASE! And every now and then, the movie looks like a cheap 80s comedy...not sure how to explain it, but whenever the crew pulls out of their porn theater hide-out, it looks like a scene from DC Cab or something.Anyway, there are quite a few laughs to be had. Melanie Griffith is particularly hilarious in the openning hotel scene, and there are a few surprises as far as cameo appearances. I liked Serial Mom, and the humor quotient was about equal here, so I guess I can say I recommend it, but probably only for Waters fans, who are accustomed to overacting and cheesiness."
3,To send a message use Western Union,"Film starts out fresh and funny and is outrageously similar to the PattyHearst kidnapping, but the characters then progress into cartoon dolls,each getting shot or burned at least five times before the end. SouthPark was similar to this. Why do they bounce back when hit or land ontheir feet jumping three stories down? Satirical pokes at genre filmaudiences get laughs, but the violence is overboard and believable only on a comic book level."
2,Wrong region :),Was looking for this season for over 10 years and when I finally find it and spend almost a fortune for Amazon to send it ... It's the wrong region :). Really love the season and am thankful to have found it but I can't watch it in it's true glory
4,an issue with sound,the series was delivered well on time and looks great but the background music is SO LOUD compared to the dialogue that we literally have to readjust every time.. very annoying and interferes with the enjoyment of the show..not sure why this is happening which is why I only gave it 4 stars..
3,JAG: JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL COMPLETE SERIES,"THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS NOT AS GOOD AS EXPECTED BUT, OKAY. IT WAS LIKE VIEWING AN ANALOG PICTURE INSTEAD OF HI DEFINITION."
4,great series. poor packaging,"was slightly disappointed with the overall packaging. It is 10 separately packaged seasons with no consistency throughout. JAG is an awesome series. There was no question in that with this purchase, i was just hoping for better display packaging."
5,A must-have for your DVD library!!!!,"I got hooked on this show when it was in prime time, then watched it again in re-runs on HDNET, and then I knew I wanted the full set for my family to see with me. We love the military men and women with tons of respect, and this just gives us a look into a side of the military we don't see everyday. And who, of us ladies, wouldn't want David James Elliot on our screen for hours without commercials!!!! Nice!!!"
4,buy it,"This game is great>> If you are in for graphics. Don't buy it. Is you love FIFA don't buy it. Is you are into the game play and strategy and know something about soccer then buy it. One time I played FIFA because people would keep talking about it, and I could not believe how unreal it was. I could not believe that I made all my goals from about half the yard, and whenever I got close to the goal the keeper would always stop it. In the real life is not like that, sorry to tell you. That's why I pick MLS extra time ten times over FIFA."
2,World cup fever,Being an Englishman I feel very well placed to rate soccer games as I have been playing them all my life. I was really looking forward to MLS extratime as Konami make the best soccer games and I thought with the GC it could only be a winner.First impressions were bad as the game looks like an old PS one title and unfortunately when compared to the PS2 version it looks woeful.Gameplay is simple and fun but compared to Pro Evolution on the PS2 this game will only ever be a subsitute and not in the starting eleven.
1,Very far from ISS or Winning Eleven,"As a Brazilian, I don't believe I would buy this game if I had played it before. It's much worse than international superstar soccer of N64, Winning Eleven and even FIFA 2002 is better (I never liked Fifa series).It doesn't even have a proper international tournament.It's better to wait for International Superstar Soccer, which has already been released in Europe. Unfortunately, neither Nintendo website nor Konami websites give any information about this product and when it's gonna be released in USA."
5,I like the Naruto necklace!!,"I am a Naruto fan, and I brought this necklace for my birthday! It looks great on me, not to mention the meaning of the leaf symbol. It made my birthday special."
4,A misunderstood artist with groovy music,"I first found out about Crystal Waters when I first started downloading midis from the Web a number of years ago - I downloaded ""Gypsy Woman"". I liked the catchy rhythm, jazzy, bluesy harmony, and the 3 versus 4 rhythm that dominates much of the piece. I bought the album to see if her other songs have the same good attributes. Sure enough, I find that I liked ""Surprise"" and ""Good Lovin""; the latter had a relaxing and rhythmical feel, and ""Surprise"" features numerous discords (e.g., an E sitting atop an E maj7 chord, conflicting with the D#) and notes sung flat or sharp - I feel these make the piece INTERESTING! My main fault with the album is that some of the tunes go on and on an on with the same motif, making them boring. I feel that her voice is adequate. If this is not one of her strong points, she still makes the most of what she has. For good dance music, I would heartily recommend this album."
5,Very Interesting artist.,"Crystal, was very interesting from the start.Like NYC is the birth place of Hip Hop.Chicago is the birth place of House music!When Chicagoans got word on Crystal and her material, we were confused, she was like 6yrs too late. Seriously, when (CW) hit in 1991 House music had packed up and went overseas. HipHop was the new trump in Chi!(CW) hit the town hard, with her odd sing along, however, message in a bottle style.This artist ran the Town crazy, we had never heard anything like it.Gypsy woman, Chicago, wanted to hate this record, we couldn't, it was very deep, and it was a smash, Surprise was another. There are so many cuts on this project, it is a must have.This album can easily hold an entire party on its own. No, mixing, no DJing, just press PLAY!"
4,Good stuff!,"Good album to bang your head to. Good crunchy guitars and driving rhythms. If your seeking intelectual fodder, skip this but if you just want to rock out, this is the band to do it."
1,Product not tested at the factory,"The trimmer doesn't work at all.....new batteries, nothing......everything else is ok but not pleased with the product at all..."
2,Cheap product,"Product looks great, and the kit comes with plenty of extras and guards, but the actual trimmer is of cheap quality. Plastic parts working the trimming blades broke by the 4th use... and I know it's certainly not my hair thickness, I'm slowly balding! Poorly made, which is a shame, my previous conair trimmer lasted nearly 10 years. Bought a Wahl in a store afterwards, and it's worked very well."
1,"cheap, blades slipped","I received this item with my reward points, mostly because I needed new clippers and because it was the only option. I shave my head so I did not need all the other items in this kit and only used the clippers with no guard. It worked great and I got a close shave for a total of 3 times. The fourth time the small blade had a piece inside it the broke away so it slipped and was not even with the larger front blade so I knicked my head several times. Cheaply made and had I been doing quick hard swipes like I normally do, I would have cut myself several more times because the blade was literally sticking out and in effect worked as an electric knife. Stay away from this plastic item."
4,Good kit with all we need to cutting hair,I've used several different brands in the past and this Conair has worked very well. Been using it for over a year now to cut my hair and my now 3.5 year old's hair. The only thing we have not used is the small battery powered trimmer. I tried once but I think my batteries were dead. Anyway overall it's a solid product.
1,Absolute Junk,Pros:Comes with lots of pieces in a nice case.Cons:None of that matter because it doesn't cut hair. It just glides through your hair without actually cutting it. If it gets any significant amount of hair in it's teeth it will lock up and the head will pull off of the trimmer body.Bottom Line:Absolute junk. Do not buy this.
1,Shame on you Amazon,"So Amazon, you can buy the complete Alias season 1-3 set for $169 or each individual season for $52.49. Hmmm so how does the ""Amazon Exclusive Alias 1-3"" set save me money? ($52.49 x 3 = $157.47). C'mon Amazon it was bad enough when you started offering to let us buy an additional book with the one we wanted and still charge us full price for each book, all the while trying to make it look like you were saving us money, but now you are asking for more money to ship 3 DVD sets together than you would to ship each set individually? Maybe you should teach your pricing people how to do basic math."
3,Pump my Price Up,"I still think that Walmart had a much better price by buying them seperate, but wekk /borders is just really expensive if you want the truth and they should lower thier prices because then maybe more people would buy things from thier store and I really don't care if you post this on your website or not. This is just for you to know."
1,A Female James Bond,Alias must the most boring and dumbest show on TV in years. The acting is lame and EVERYONE is always looking down and try to act. The story is boring and always so typical James Bond. Don't waste your money and time on this crappy non-funny piece of crap.
5,keenlyside is a wonder...magnificent....,What a wonderful performance...quality is great and keenlyside is wonderful...I am new to classical...and just adore his voice...you won't regret this purchase....
3,Overstylized Monteverdi,"Tempos are slow, costumes strange; semi-choreography irrelevant. Singers are good, but the whole effect is flat--on its way to a mobile Robert Wilson production. I'm not even sure I would prefer just the CD."
2,"Good citizenship, bland graphics, good for kids.","I was excited about this game, because I thought this game would allow you to build Lego models, cars and buildings, I could not be more wrong! This is a role-playing game, where you are Pepper, a Lego kid on Lego Island. Basically the point of the game is to walk around the island talking to the Lego people who send you on tasks and give you various things for your work. Such things as items, Lego pieces and trading cards, which hold no importance, its just a picture of a Lego character. Also, you can discover mini games, like a Lego skate park, Joust and a few classic arcade games that are fun. For the older more cynical gamers, avoid this game, but if you are a parent that wants a game that inadvertently teaches your child about good citizenship and being kind to others, pick this up. The graphics are not the best, but they are good considering that this is a game with Legos."
2,Kids Only Game,"The Plus point about this game is the amount of sub-games it has. Some of them are boring, but most of them are interesting. The plot of the game can get very boring. Basically you are this lego fellow, whom is trying to recover all the pages of the various building in Legoland that are being destroyed by the bad guy. This bad guy fellow constantly pop up during the game to give you useless remarks. some of the pages require the player to complete certain tasks before u can lay your hands on it. I would say this game is more for kids, whom might find it interesting. Personally I find the game a turn off. completed it twice within one day of buying. Check out what other reviewers have to say about this before buying it. Don't think this game is worth buying"
1,NEVER WORKED,"The system requirements on the box are misleading. Your computer needs much more to run it, and to this day, the game never worked and Lego admitted there were problems and replaced it WITH ANOTHER GAME. Disappointed 5 year old."
5,"Intens, hard-rocking, original.",Up till now my favorite Chris Whitley album was Dirt Floor. There's another favorite now; this latest album by the late great floor-stomping singer is raw and rocking with a twist. The hard drive works to perfection in combination with a souring violin. Buy this CD and if you do not own a copy of Dirt Floor buy that one two
3,Hmmm.,Not my favorite or even second favorite. It's pretty far down on my list. Has a couple of good songs but not his best work.
1,one for the obsessives,This was a disappointment for me...the recording quality is poor and it was obviously released post-mortem...maybe to milk the legend?? One for the obsessives only..stick to his studio work.
2,actionair diver,"it takes too much air pressure to operate it,and this small pump cant handle it.it alsso has no action at all."
2,Software Problem and Freezing Up,"I've own a number of laptops including other Toshibas and never had a problem like this.After a week of using this laptop it started freezing up at random times. I ran scans, cleaned the registry, etc,.. no luck. Finally I took it in to service, they had it a week and then said it was software related and must be caused by a software conflict. They did a factory re-install and I was forced to loose all data.After getting it back, I very carefully did the windows updates before installing any software of my own. Sure enough it started freezing again after window updates only.There must be an incompatibility with some of the software loaded in this laptop and Windows update, but I'm still stuck with this problem until someone figures it out.Anyone have a solution??If not for this MAJOR hassle, I'd be quite happy with this laptop."
5,Excellent Pictoral History,"Decades of Beauty is both an excellent pictoral as well as literary history of beauty through the decades. Great pictures that have not been often seen showcase the fashion fads of each era along with the fashion icons who are responsible for that decade's fashion hype. I loved that this book also gave equal space to the history of cosmetic beauty through the years. Its fascinating to see what type of makeup each generation ""had to have"" along with the ""hippest"" hairstyles of the day. The contents are easy to read and allows one to pick and choose a decade of interest without having to read the book start to finish. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a cosmetic junkie, fashion obsessed, or just a history buff. This would also make an excellent gift for those in the beauty industry. Enjoy!"
5,Interesting Look at Styles Through the Years,"This book covers the changing styles and images from the 1890s thru the 1990s. Each section covers the life & times, faces in vogue, film and media, fashion, hair and hats, cosmetics, body shape and underwear, and work and play for a particular decade. Filled with interesting facts and tons of photographs, this makes the perfect addition to the library of anyone interested in fashion, cosmetics, or history! Fun and unique!"
4,IT'S GREAT BUT COULD HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER,"I think this book had a lot of great insight to it , but to me it never got fully to the point of fashion . The picture selections could have been better too ( except for the Edna Purviance one , a distant reletive of mine ) But the illustrations were nice and the colors worked well . Overall , I was entertained with this book for a couple of weeks but now when I open it i know what to expect . In my opinion , books should be a fascinating new journey each time you open it . This book only gives a peek of what is really behind the fashion world . But i agree this is a must have book and thats why i rate it four stars ."
5,carpe noctum,possibly the best pagan world/folk beat music I have heard. Each song carries you into a visual landscape where words tell it all to a compelling beat. I want more!!! I can actually see myself IN the story-line of each song. A rich tapestry of word and music.
4,"Nice, Fun, Family Game","Crash is almost a must-have on the Xbox.It's fun for everyone in the family (my 7 year old played it without a problem - but younger kids may not be able to). It will keep you busy for a while (there are about 25 different levels to fight through, plus 5 ""bosses"" - and you can revisit levels to get more lives or other bonuses). There's almost no learning curve.It's just plain old fun!If you liked Fuzion Frenzy, and you don't mind single player games, then you'll like Crash.Some complain that it's graphics aren't breakthrough - but they are certainly sufficient for you to clearly see what is going on.The only real complaint: I wish there were a 2 player mode."
3,Crash plays a tough game!,"When I bought this game, I thought that it would bem fun and easy to beat. Boy was I wrong...the game is fun...for a while, but it is very hard. Each level is 3D, and some of the camera angles are horrible. Anyway, this game will give you lots of fun, but frustrating hours of good gameplay.Graphics get 5 starsSound gets 4 starsGameplay gets 4 starsControls get 3 starsOverall, I'd buy this game if you love Crash (like me) and are a good gamer (not like me)."
3,"Fun for all ages, but a bit too hard for the younger kids","The game is average in just about all aspects: graphics, gameplay, and storyline. The game doesn't provide anything over the standard Mario-type-smashing-crates-and-collecting-fruit game, but is still fun, nonetheless, and provides a good amount of play time. Many of the levels are too challenging for younger players. There are some levels where the player ""dies"" by missing a jump, falling into water, and drowning. I thought the image of the character floating face down in the water wasn't appropriate for younger kids. For the most part, though, it will provide entertainment for all ages."
4,FAR less loading times...,"I'll keep this short. This is a quality platformer with some solid visuals, so-so sound, and some very good controls. On the PS2 the load times were 45-50 sec. in and OUT of levels, on the Xbox the load times are way down: 13 sec. into and about 8-9 sec. out of levels. So, there is a difference of 32-37 sec. different in loading time. This makes a big difference b/c the levels themselves though enjoyable are actually pretty short. So, who wants to spend more time loading than playing? Not I. Kudos to Travellers Tales for crunching down that code... however, they should apologize to PS2 owners!"
4,Crash Bandicoot The Wrath Of Cortex is the colest game ever,"...This game is real cool the graphics are great,sometimes the camera angles trick you but you can hadle it right?Another thing is crash gets to ride cool vehicles from a crop duster to a giant robot suit.You can also use crash's sister coco in some levels and control her like crash.Some levels are frustrating and are hard to pass.Crash gets one new power tiptoeing so that nitro boxes that explode if you make sound wont blow up.Now I will tell you neo cortex'es scheme he makes a strong bandicoot named crunch powered by the evil masks of water,fire,earth,and wind.I tell you you should get this game it's really cool...you will have a lot of fun I promise!"
5,Fun for Hours,"I am 11 and I first played this game at a friend's house, and could not stop. I heard that it was not being made anymore. I found it used and new on amazon. it arrived two days later. it is fun for everyone in my family, me, my little sister, my mom, and my dad."
1,Ew,"I got this game with an Xbox a long while ago. I had already played Crash : Mind Over Mutant with my friend and was super-excited. But when I played this I was disappointed with bad graphics, a boring plot, and it was simply confusing. DO NOT GET THIS GAME. If you want Crash, get Crash : Mind Over Mutant. Or settle for Spyro : Dawn of the Dragon, Mario, or Call of Duty."
4,I take back what I said about this game,I changed my mind about the game. It is pretty fun and plus the console version of crash is better than the GBA version but that's okay.I'd give this game 4 stars.(usually it takes long to load to a level)
5,Great Fun 4 all!!!!!!,if u liked the one's on PS2 and PSX then you'll love this game!!!!!!!...........im not sure but their may more levels on the XBOX version!!!!.......and im sure this game well have better graphics than ps2 version!!!!!...........i say get this game its great fun!!!!!!
5,Excellent!!,Top notch platform/action game for the xbox. Hours of fun for all ages. Excellent graphics and sound. A must have for any xbox owner.
1,bad,"i placed a order on december 21, 2012 and i still have not received the game i emailed the sender but they did not reply.....do not buy anything fron this person"
1,Very dissappointed,This item does not work with my xbox at all - says I need a hard drive storage - and I also did not realize that even if it did work it was only for one player
3,Very fun,I originally bought this thinking you can play it on Xbox 360. I was disappointed to know that it doesn't play on the newer version of Xbox but I'll be sure to pay attention to detail next time. Regardless we also have the original Xbox and the kids play it for hours. Graphics suck compared to the new video games that come out nowadays but it is good clean fun and is worth the price.
4,If you like mario...,"Crash Bandicoot is a classic platform game. It's fun and appropriate in most aspics, as in all games sometimes crash may die but no blood or gruesome scenes occur. There is a promising amount of play time and the levels vary a lot in difficulty. Younger kids and adults would find this game fun. There aren't many frills and the graphics are a few steps above N64 but the camera angle and controls are fairly easy to master. There isn't a two player mode (which would make the game better). You can save after every level that's a plus, and there is crashes sister(?) Who you get to play some levels with. The variation in setting makes the game even more enjoyable"
4,"Extremely difficult, but a very good game!!!!","This is a awsome game, but it is very hard. So if you like adventure and difficulty you will like this game. The graphics are cool and so are the levels. so you'd better get this game!!!!!"
3,Moss Method Randy Moss Present,Moss Method Randy Moss PresentRandy Moss is the wonderfull WR but this documentary is too short !and we can learn a lot of things about him. If you like Randy Moss learn more about him.
5,A 'must-have' during high school,"In order to get all the information that The Little College Handbook gives you, you need hours and hours of research, and most of the things that this book tells you, you wouldn't find anywhere. This book is easy to read, understandable, and interesting. It guides you, and shows you how to get into college, receive the financial aid you need, and tells you what might happen once you're in college. Melissa knows how to talk to teens and make them understand that college isn't as hard as it sounds."
1,The Little College Handbook; Mapping your College Dreams,"The Little College Handbook was very difficult to navigate given the lack of subheadings, index, and page numbers. The information was over-generalized, and narrowly focussed on the author's own experience rather than capturing more universal perceptions."
5,ORANGE COUNTY CHOPPERS,"STUNNING COFFEE TABLE BOOK, SUBSTANTIAL VOLUME, EXCELLENT PHOTOGRAPHY - MAKES A LOVLY PRESENT FOR CHRISTMAS."
5,Like an educational I-Spy book,"This book is so much fun. It has pictures of animals in their natural habitats. It tells facts about the animals. You have to search for some animals, on the borders of the page it tells how many of a species are in the search. They provide the answers at the back of the book. We've been stumped a couple of times. :)"
2,the wine club,not really what I expected. Would like to have been able to see the contents before buying.I'm sure there are much better books and resources for organizing a wine club.Would not recommend to anyone for purchase.
4,Never a Better Beginners Book,"Without a doubt, this is my favorite ""welcome to the world"" book for new college grads. Who else needs more help making friends in the real world and impressing new colleagues with a little specialty wine knowledge? Besides, entertaining at home takes on a whole new twist when you have a few secret weapons (yummy recipes and wine pairings) that will impress just about anyone coming over to enjoy your company."
5,Must have book from awesome wine educator!,"The wine club is such a great concept -- there couldn't be a more rewarding way to learn about wine than to share it with friends and be guided by a CIA grad and certified sommelier. Petrosky certainly has the notches on her belt to be a true wine snob, but she so smartly chooses not too. Her friendly voice and candor indicate that at some point in her life she too walked the first steps of learning about wine -- and therefore knows just the way to teach it to the rest of us! This book should be handed to everyone on the occasion of the purchase of their first bottle of wine. It is a great guide book to the rite of passage that is wine drinking."
2,BOB HOPE The Vietnam Years 1970,"Ordered this DVD because I was on the USS John F Kennedy when he was aboard. I was kind of disappointed as they only did a very quick out take on all of his stops that year and only 3 or 4 of the skits were even shown and only one performance of one of the people with him.. We all loved and appreciated Bob and the people with him. This DVD will only give one a very brief look at his performances. Apparently this is a copy of his tour that was edited for release to the TV audience and trying to get 8-10 stops in to an hour was just too much to be really good. Just wish someone would put together complete shows for each of the places he visited. To Bob, Thanks for the memories."
2,Hugely disappointing,"I wanted to relive the moment Barbara McNair sang ""[I am a ] W-O-M-A-N"" to thousands of bedazzled GIs at Bearcat on Christmas 1967 and all I got was silence. I can't believe it was cut! I also got tired of Bob Hope's championing of the war."
5,Great Video!,"This series covers all 9 Bob Hope USO shows he did in SEA. Although a few of the jokes were carried over each year, these shows remain fresh after many years. A must have for the Hope fan in everyone!"
5,A Vietnam Veteran's review.,"As a Vietnam Veteran; I happily recommend this DVD collection to anyone who was there, or has an interest in either Vietnam or Bob Hope. Bob Hope was one of those rare individuals who was able to entertain without being too ""edgy"", too offensive, or too political."
5,SAlute the Troops,"I watched these dvds of Bob Hope's Christmas Vietnam years, and they did a lot to cheer the troops who were so far from home, and who would give anything to spend Christmas with there loved ones.But now that Bob Hope is GONE, who has taken his place to entertain the troops during the CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY SEASON? I think its time for entertainers who say, we support the troops and put their money where their mouths are. Spend a Christmas with the troops it would probably be the best Christmas EVER."
3,mindLESS station,"Not sure why, but I could not get the light to indicate that power was being supplied to the mind station to turn on. I was kindly sent a replacement. The frog on the replacement light up for about 3 minutes then no more indication of power.It looks like someone else reviewing, has an issue with her mindstation and cable, When I get it to power up, I'll see if I have any success getting my daughters spelling list to down load."
3,"If the Mind Station worked, it would be great!!","We purchased the Turbo Twist Spelling with the Mind Station. The Turbo Twist on it's own was a good product, though it gave some words that not even the most intellectual person would know. But the Mind Station...forget it!! It would not download any of the activity packs or the lists that we entered ourselves. The computer thought it did, but it would not transfer to our cartridge. The support on-line was not very good either. They kept telling us to remove things from our system (eg. our palm pilot (which we needed), our virus protector and our camera ports>things we use almost daily),just so the game would work. I did not think playing a spelling game was more important than protecting our computer or using our camera. Needless to say, I returned the product."
5,Great grow with educational toy,I bought this for my son and even with out a cartridge the toy works! Has built in stuff and games to do. We have not yet used mind station or a cartridge but plan to within the month. I was bumbed out that there was no AC adapted with the toy and will be running out to get one. My son loves this soo much that I had to give him head phones so he could play with out disturbing others. The sound is adjustable but it can be tough to hear what words are being said if you have other noises around you. So since switching to head phones he has no problems at all.
4,Next -- the Deadly Piratical Killer Rabbit,"Monty Python's Flying Circus in piratical dress. If you like Monty Python and are in a cheery mood, Defoe's light-hearted romp is a lot of fun. Sometimes the jokes get a little old, and the Pythons were wittier writers; but Adventure with Ahab is nevertheless a great weekend read. Best of all, it never succumbs to the pitfall, so common in contemporary books, of taking itself too seriously.It'll be interesting to see what the next book in the series brings."
4,looking forward to new titles by this author,"from beginning to end, the priate captain and ahab was a great read; a fun read and someting i'd recommend to readers who sometimes find little time to really read for just plain fun."
4,Not the Prized Ham!,"Very enjoyable book, light read with amusing footnotes (I'm still ltrying to figure out if all of them are real or not). I'm going to have to read the first one just to see what it is like, I was rather dissapointed to find out all the books in the back are fake.The Pirate Captain is fantasticly whimsical, and I loved how he makes fun of Ahab.Just a fun sort of almost Wodehousian read (though the one reader who compared it to Series of Unfortunate Events wasn't far off the mark--its that sort of mock seriousness which it is narrated with)"
2,book review by:matt kelly mod:1,"The book ""pirates and the adventures of ahab"" is a book about a group of pirates and there captians name ia ahab and he is a real nut case.There boat is falling apart so the are tryen to get this new boat.The book manly talks about that one adventure.My favorite part of this book was really funny.So, the pirates Ahab and some other salars were sitting down to eat.Then one of the salars was telling ahab how a whale bite made him get a fake leg.Then ahab starts talken about how he a a bug bite that lasted a while.I thlought it was funny because one guy talks about a missing leg and the other guy talks about a bump on his skin.I would recomend this book to someone who would like a good laugh.It's a easy read for people who wait till the last minute.This book was recomended to me,I wilol recomend it to you.The book keeps you interested.THe book i s could and i give it 4 stars out of 5 stars. You will always want to know what ahab does next.All and all read this book."
2,"Amusing, but a little TOO lite","Is this a kids story that adults would love? Or a story for adults that kids could read?""The Pirates!"" is amusing, nonsensical and fun, but it's a little TOO cheerful, a little TOO lighthearted. We get it, the Pirate Captain is an empty-headed egomaniac and the nameless crew members are all dolts except for the one who seems to be the only one who understands the trouble they're walking into. It's not a pirate story at all, really. It's a ship of fools wearing pirate clothes.Don't get me wrong, it's funny for a while, but it's doggedly cheerful tone gets old fast. It's so light it floats away.If you want to read a real, rollicking pyrate tale with adventure and humor and anochronism and it's a great sea yarn, read George MacDonald Fraser's ""The Pyrates!"" That's a book for adults. This is kid stuff."
1,STAY AWAY!!,"I recieved this game along with my GBA as a present. I am 26 years old and have been playing games since ""Pong"". This game has to be one of the worst games I think I have ever played. I LOVED ""Legends of Zelda/Links"" and this game falls close the the same game play...but the story line is non-existant and the game play is difficult at times. This game is no for anyone over 12 years old or so...under 12 might find it somewhat fun. I the only good part of the game is the graphics. Buy it used!"
2,bad,"this is a bad game. period. however, for little kids that have gba and this is the only game they will ever get, it may be great. but, to experienced gamers who have seen the likes of great games like thps(*for every system but gba), dragon warrior, and even the new advance wars and golden sun, this game just bites.*see my gba thps2 review"
1,A Gamer,This game stinks! Its the worst game I've ever played! If you have been thinking about getting this game don't do it!
1,this is not a game,the graphics are fairly decent but its not long at all I finished in a week and I think the hole story line is messed up the action is poor too.Do reaserch before you buy the game and make sure its what you want.
3,A disappointment,"Man, I thought this game was going to be fun. It is, up to a point. But it's nearly impossible to get the light right, and the storyline is missing. And the point of Bionicle is it's story. It only gives you one bit of story related information. The game is also glitchy. You can easily get stuck, walk on water, or float in midair. Especially if you are hunting for the elusive second disc, or the hidden ""life-up"" berries.The reason I give it 3 stars is because it has a bunch of extremly fun minigames. Also, this game may have the best graphics of any GBA game. Almost. Check out the final lava surfing sequence. (Not the minigame). The nice extras are that the discs and ""Volo Mapta Launcher"" (a hookshot thingy) will adapt to your colors of the Tohunga you choose.But the game is the same in each level. Save the Turaga. Get the crystals. Get the stone. Go to next village. Repeat six times. Surf on lava. End of game. I beat it in 6 hours.I hope the gamecube one is much, much better."
3,A Game For Those Who Are Vigilant,"I thought that the bionicle toys were pretty cool and so when my brother got this game I was expecting the best. Well, the graphics are the most amazing I've seen in any GBA game; they truely show the best of what a GBA can do. That's about the only reason I rated this game three stars. That and the exetremely fun minigames. The first two levels you start out with are fairly easy, but after that it is extremely hard - nearly impossible. It is the most frusterating game I have ever encountered. Plus, the worlds are hard to navigate through. Sometimes you have to jump or throw at bizarre angles, and there are little things like rocks and patches of grass dotting the terrain that you can't walk or jump over. Some of the monsters are very very hard to beat, and when the kill you, you have to start back at the beginning of the level (all of them are very long). So if this is the kind of game you enjoy, by all means buy it. Otherwise don't waste your money."
2,its a little complicated,"i dont like it. Whenever you are playing it, and you get stuck behind a tree i could not move and on the rock boss on level 1 pushes me in the wall to kill me. I also cant see the screen because its too dark. And the level with the giant scorpion, i cant figure out what to do.Where do i go?"
3,Stil not that great.,"Hey, author of not that great here. I just want to say thanks for a 20 out of 24 good review! But this time it's differant. Oh I still think the game stinks it's just I think it's gotten worse. The gameplay is still dull, there's no way to navigate or way to now where to go next, your player is slow, and the weapons and trowing systems just were not designed well. The mini-games are okay but kinda weird. The reason it has a 3 instead of a 1 is because its still a good concept and they might still have a chance at a sequel. (...)"
4,"This is good, but . . .","It has good graphics, and requires strategic thinking. But if you get stuck at a level, it can take a long time to figure what to do."
4,The third toa stone,"Okay, ill start off by saying to get te third toa stone you just use the drill to go undergroung when your at the big scourpion and then pop up from undernath him. Its hard to do but he only takes 2 hits. ANYWAY this game is okay. Graphics are good, and all but that backwards summersoult he does when he lands on a bush or something-awful. that little thing single-handedly lost the game a whole star. if you love bionicle and just want to feed your passion for it, then get this otherwise, dont pay retail."
2,Zzzzzzzzz...,This is a bore. Why would anyone waste 40-50 on a GBA game like this one?! The object of this game is to retrieve all of the 6 Toa Stones and participate in pathetic mini games. I don't like this game. The last part of the game is impossible. Spend your 40-50 dollars on one of these games below:Super Mario AdvanceAdvance WarsGolden SunAdvance Wars 2: Black Hole RisingGolden Sun: The Lost AgeThe Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
3,Not the best...,"First off, the graphics are nice. Some of the parts in this game are challenging, which caused me to kick my dog and yell loudly. You have to be a villiager. No toa.:( It's not so bad, but some lack of effort to make a game is visable. I suggest getting it at a low price, so you don't feel cheated like I did."
3,a 11 year old gamer,this gane is one of the weirdest games Ihave played it is challaging and fun well for the first weak or two then the enimes get harder and you get bored of seeing your little guy fante agin and agin but don' get me wrong I like this game it's just to hard
4,This game is awsome!,I really love this game but I only have one problem that I can't seem to find my way to Po-Koro and every road I take in Ga-Koro is a Dead End and going Northeast takes me back to Onu-Koro so I'm not sure how to get to Po-Koro...
3,an ok game,its an ok game. i dont really know what to do. i made it to the underground place.it stinks you have to be the earth villager. save your money and buy a GC AND sUPER MARIO SUNSHINE. see my review on THe other bionicle matoroan adv.
5,Outstanding!!,Karenga has done a wonderful piece in the Husia! I take this book as a counteraction to all self-help books by modern authors. Of who most of them have had some sort of power in one area or another. But who better for Africans to read than our own people of power about how to realize their blessings and priviledges that the Most High has put upon them in any given sitution. I love this book because it translate African minds of the past when power and domination was our footstool. And how we didn't use these blessings to produce negative thinking and action. And how we always gave prasie to the one who help bestowed those great achievements for us. I take this book as a holistic mental and emotional playbook. To see any sitution better side! And to remind us that nothing is new under ATEN-RA. And if you stay in the heights of the positive you would be able to see clearer all the blessing we have! TUA NTR KARENGA!!!
5,"""THE BLACK MAN'S BIBLE""","This book is recommended to all Africans period. Excellent book. So excellent, i got to buy another one to keep in my car for transport and my home. This is the real bible for the African"
4,A Good Read,"I got this book as a gift for my son, he said it was a good read. He is learning a lot from this writing."
5,Excellent source of spiritual and practical life sessons,"I would like to applaud Dr. karenga and all of those who helped to make this project a reality. There is no substitute for speaking your own truth, from your own mouth, in your own way. I think that this document should be required reading for all aspiring clergy and other people of good will. The only remaining challenge relative to this book is for Dr. Karenga and others is to expand upon this great, historic work by conducting further retranslations and expanding the legacy."
3,authoritative English rendering of specific works source unk,While I genuinely respect the work of Dr. Karenga I find this material to miss his intended mark. The regeneration of the much maligned tradition of Kemet(ic) people creates a window of opportunity for those who are able to free themselves for the dogma of aggressive religous works. I applaud the attempt and look forward to more works hopefully with original material integrated.
4,Its OK only,"Ok the reason I dont give a 5 star its because they dont proper explain that these are NOT mounts, guess is my mistake because i didnt research better, my mounts were pretty bad so I needed new, now couple tips if ur putting it in your sentra SER, use some WD40 to lubricate the insert and the metal piece when you put it back together..that helps a lot to push it back in position.Performance improve a lot, yes and car feel like a race car, just bcuz sounds so agressive..vibration is minimum in my opinion but in the freeway on long distances it might b anoying, but im ok with that... $40 that r worth it. My engine runs smooth and stiff at the same time."
2,"Oops, I did it again!","Welcome back Norman, or not...Blochs sequel to his most popular book is somewhat disappointing. That said, I will still read Psycho House, just to finish the sequels although I do so with a strange feeling that I may be disappointed again."
2,Not Like the Movie,"Surprisingly this book has nothing in common with the movie ""Psycho II"" other than the title. I was glad, because I didn't enjoy this at all and that is rare for me to dislike something by Robert Bloch. It's a most forgettable book. It's good to obtain to see what it's like. But for entertainment purposes, I'd watch the movie instead. The movie takes us back to the Bates Motel with Norman getting out of the mental hospital after many years. And that's what we expect when we hear ""Psycho II"". Not this."
3,What a surprise!,"Not the best book around, but good enough to have been the basis for the film sequel."
1,DON'T get this book.....,"This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. It started out good, but the end is horribly dissapointing. For one thing, the book was supposed to be about Norman Bates. Norman was in the first three or four chapters. In short, if you're looking for a book about Norman Bates, buy Psycho 1. If you want to read a book that really misleads and upsets you, buy Psycho 2."
5,a great addition for any collectorwho is a Cancer,"I hate it when reviewers write the same stupid review for 24 different dolls. Some bozo has written the same stupid thign for all 24 of the ZOdiac dolls and then complains the dolls are boring becase they are not different. DUH! The idea is THAT THEY ARE THE SAME and you pick your OWNzodiac sign and ethncity and you don't have to worry that if you are a Cancer, that the Capricorn doll has MORE RHINESTONES! Unlike previous birthstone dolls like these, this was NOT a Wal-mart exclusive."
5,Pure genius!!,"Mr Show with Bob and David is easily one of the greatest comedyshows of all time! I don't mean that lightly. I hold Monty Python's Flying Circus, SNL (when it was funny), and the Kids in the Hall with the highest reguard, but Mr Show may be the funniest of the lot. How is it that these guys aren't household names? HBO foolishly put them on at 12:00 am Mondaynights with little promotional support. Sadly, I think the bigger problem lies in the fact that many people don't like their comedy (or entertainment in general) to challange them. Mr Show does just that. It's comedy thats edgy and surreal while remaining extraordinarily relevant. A must own! Absolutely hillarious!!"
5,Shake the Crime-Stick!,"Please, let them release Seasons 3 and 4.A few of my personal favorite sketches:Shake the Crime-StickShampooBilliards VideosPit-PatChange for a DollarThe Independent Nation's OlympicsThe Joke: The MusicalIf you have a pulse, this should make you laugh! Period."
2,Great expectations... but kinda l[sad].,"I had never seen Mr. Show during its original run, ... and couldn't wait to get the DVD. Man, were we disappointed. There are glimpses of the greatness of, say, Monty Python, SCTV and Kids in the Hall, but more often than not the sketches are... kinda [sad]. And like SNL (during the ""bad years"") many sketches don't know when to stop and run out of steam before the creative and surreal transition to the next one. No doubt Cross and Oderkirk are talented, but--at least in the first 3 shows that we watched--you have to wade through lots of cringe-inducing mediocrity for the few genuinely out-loud laughs."
2,Kids in the Hall/Monty Python it is not,"The first season of Mr. Show is absolutely painful to watch. Without any of the brilliance but in the style of Monty Python, poorly drawn sketches are fumbled through in a manner reminiscent of a college theater production. The ideas are not terrible, but the execution is abominable and the writing is half-baked.The second season is far superior to the first, but remains just lukewarm.See the title of this review."
2,Disappointing,"I could only get through the first season. It felt like a rough draft for a bad Kids in the Hall episode. I saw the comparisons made in other reviews, and felt I had to chime in, this doesn't come close to their stuff, and (as some people that have maybe watched 3 hours combined of television and movies in their life) is the furthest from Monty Python as I could find. Yes, it's ""conceptual"", and if you love bad concepts (like New Coke) then this is the show for you. They try, they strain, and they [disappoint]. I gave a couple of chuckles, but as far as comedy goes, I laughed harder at Krsystof Kieslowski's ""White."""
2,Overrated,"After reading the reviews of this DVD set, I felt that I must get it. It sounded so great. Unfortunately, it's nowhere near good. Some reviewers say that the comedy is over people's heads. Yeah, no. The skit where someone is asking for change for a dollar is not over my head, it's just stupid. I didn't give this set the lowest rating(1 star) simply because Brian Posehn was cool and the incubator pants(they'll get you chicks) skit was cute. But that's one skit out of many. If you want truly awesome sketch comedy, try Kids in the Hall. They're hilarious, which is more than I can say for Bob and David."
3,Not the best sketch show ever,"I like the show, but the hyperbole in the reviews is over the top. It's better than SNL, but not as good as Kids In The Hall. David Cross is great, Bob Odenkirk is mediocre. The writing is top-notch."
1,really not funny,"i remember watching the occasional episode of mr. show on hbo and thinking it was pretty funny. the seasons must have gotten progressively funnier or something because this was terrible. i'll admit that i laughed a couple times. the laugh to annoyed eye roll ratio is probably 1:500. i know, i know, to each his/her own. and i know a lot of people on here gave this a 4 or 5...i just can't help but wonder if they thought they were reviewing a different tv series."
2,"I rait this Dvd as ""fair"" ONLY!","This Dvd is good, but it's not a great Dvd. I have others that are more funny. I would rank this DVd 16th out of 52 funny (comedy) Dvd's that I have bought over the lasy 2.5 years. I started in Feb 2000 buying Dvd's and I have mostly comedy (Men in Black) but others, too."
5,"Smart, funny, hip, all that [stuff].","It's poetic that the best American comedy series of the past 20 years (you heard me) stopped production after 4 seasons by the artist's choice. They had very high standards, and they stopped at the peak.Thank you, HBO, for doing SOMETHING smart. And thanks again for relegating their last season to Minday night at 12:00."
5,You Will Pee Your Pants,"Restore some modicum of justice to the world by indulging in the dark satirical wonder that was Mr. Show. Unless you don't like dark satirical wonders, that is."
4,Not the best episodes,"The first two seasons are okay, but you should buy them anyways so they generate enough sales to put out the rest of the seasons. After the 2nd season, I don't remember one bad sketch. Given the present state of the world, its people(including you and me) need to do some laughing, and there is no better medicine than post-2nd season Mr. Show. And if you need to teach your kids to swear really well, nobody does it better than Bob."
4,Mr. Show on DVD at last!,"Well it's about time that HBO gave recognition to this great show from the mid-nineties. There are some hilarious sketches on here from the first two seasons, including the ""Pit Pat"" sketch and Three Times One Minus One.However, even though the first two seasons have their moments, it's seasons 3 and 4 that really shine. I don't know whether or not there are plans to put these seasons out on DVD, but I really hope there are, because they really are funnier than the first two seasons."
5,A dream come true...,"Mr. Show is the most fantastic, intelligent, and simply hilarious sketch comedy show EVER, perhaps with the exception of Flying Circus. But as an American with a Brain, drowning in the banality of the modern age (and sometimes loving it), I would have to say that, for me, Mr. Show tops even those lads from London. If you love funny, if you love sarcasm, if you love excessive swearing, this is the must-own boxed set of the year. It will make you five times cooler than you ever were."
2,"I tried, I really tried.....","I've been told by many people that this show was an American Monty Python. While it is slightly better than SNL (Bob Odenkirk, the co-creator of this series, rarely got any of his sketches on the air while he toiled at SNL, so this show was the result), it still isn't particularly funny. The only sketches I liked were the ""burger"" commercial in Season One, the Iguana sketch (Odenkirk plays an Iguana very well), and the Jesus Christ Superstar parody is really good (though not particularly funny...just well shot and edited, it feels almost like a tribute). But other sketches drag on and on (particularly the infomercial parody), and many feel forced. The repartee between Cross and Odenkirk doesn't really work well either. I tried to get into this show, but just couldn't. Sorry..."
5,taint a lie,mr show is the funniest ever ever ever ever ever ever ever EVER ever ever ever EVer ever
2,Its alright,"I bought this due to reviews and word of mouth. A few of the sketches are hilarious. The rest I watched without so much as a smile. from what I hear, all the good stuff is in the third and fourth seasons. So buy this so they will put out the others."
5,Hilarious Show,"This is probably one of the most over looked and hilarious television shows of the 1990s - if you find yourself questioning what the rest of America finds so funny about Full House, when shows like the Ben Stiller Show and Get a Life get cancelled, than do yourself a favor and buy this dvd! Commentaries for each episode are almost as hilarious as the episodes themselves -I guarantee more laughs on one episode than on the entire run of Suddenly Susan. Buy this DVD now!!!"
4,Mr. Show First Season - Alternative Funny!!,"Not laugh out loud in many places, but brilliant with regards to what I would call ""cerebral"" humour. Very interesting and provocative. Plus, you get to see early footage of the dawning careers of Jack Black, Jeanine Garofalo, and of course, David Cross & Bob Odenkirk. Was hoping to see some of David's stand up stuff in video form but was happy to see the infamous Ronnie Dobbs' entrance into comedy reality."
4,Brilliant but noisy,"I love Mr. Show, and this DVD is worth having if you are a die hard fan. A word of warning, there is an annoying woman in the audience, with a horrid, evil laugh. Her voice appears on episode 1, and episode 4. She ruins many of the jokes with her high pitched cackle. I hate people who crave attention, especially at the expense of others."
2,Not very encouraging,"I'm with the last reviewer. This devotional is more discouraging than anything. It is also full of ""shoulds"" for people going through infertility and made me feel guilty for feeling sad and upset. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone seeking encouragement or a salve for their soul."
4,Thank you,"This devotional book contains something for every woman no matter where she is at on her infertility journey. The day to day honesty,wrapped in truth and humor is just what my soul needed."
4,You are not alone,"In a ""fertile"" world, dealing with infertility can be a very lonely experience. This book encouraged me with Scripture, made me laugh and put into words so much of what I was feeling. You will definitely feel like someone understands you when you read this book and I believe you will feel supported in knowing ""you are not alone."""
4,Classic First Call,"""Somethin' Takes Over"" is a great vintage First Call album, recorded in the days when they still were a trio (1987). This was also the year that I got into Christian Music, and there were lots of other artists out there with fine albums (The Imperials, Phil Keaggy, Heartbeat, etc.). The tracks on ""Somethin' Takes Over"": 1. The Comin' of the Lord 2. Somethin' Takes Over 3. The Reason We Sing 4. Billy on the Boulevard 5.Forever in His Care 6. O Sifuni Mungu 7.The Look 8. Back to His Heart 9. Double Talk 10. Lord of All.The standout tracks for me are ""The Reason We Sing"" (wonderful harmony vocals), and ""The Look"", a powerful well arranged rocker that spotlights all of the vocalists. ""Billy on the Boulevard"" has a Manhattan Transfer feel to it. Their next album, ""Human Song"" was nearly as good, but with one singer gone and another in her place. If you are only familiar with the more current First Call albums, ""Somethin' Takes Over"" will be a pleasant change for you."
5,4.5 stars,"This recording was made on ELP's Manticore label in 1975. It is, essentially, a collection of compositions from their first four Italian releases. Each version is completely re-done. The production is certainly superior to the originals and in most versions the arrangement's and performances are as well. Some compositions are recorded in English, others in Italian. Highly recommended...Simon"
1,Rape and Stockholm Syndrome on road to romance?,"There aren't many words to describe this book. It had the makings of a great story which quickly degraded to kidnapping and rape of the heroine by the 'hero'. These rape scenes were described in meticulous detail, all with the heroine succumbing to the charms and wiles of the hero. And of course, she 'falls' for him. All I could think of was this writer had a major bondage issue and fantasized about rape as an exciting way to spice up a boring love life. I'm sorry ladies, but there is nothing spicy, exciting or fulfilling about rape.I searched through the story and it seems that each encounter between every man and woman began with rape. Rape of young women, rape of elderly matrons, the holding of women in brothels...it defies description.I'm sorry, I won't be reading any of this author's other works. Rape is rape and it should not be enshrined in a romance story."
3,"WHERE'S A ""GREATEST HITS"" COMPILATION???","I love this guy!! I've got every LP, mint condition, but I anxiously await either a box set, or greatest hits compilation!! What gives, Sony/Epic??"
5,"Escape Artist - Maybe an acquired taste, but a very good one.","There are a lot of musical artists that are an acquired taste. Garland is clearly an acquired tasted. If you like any of his music, then you have to have ""Escape Artist."" You might find you like one of the other albums better, but this is a stunning combination of all the sophistication and the power that mark Garlands music. Rock, reggae, soul, garage, he has it all in this one place. Superbly written songs, musicanship to be awed and singing that stands up to anything in these genre's."
4,"Not quite 5 Stars, but a good collection of Mana's past hits","Being an avid Mana Fan, I have all their CD's and decided to get this one, just to have it. If you've never heard or owned a Mana CD, this would be a good starter CD, but I would recommend buying all the originals instead. There are too many classic songs left out of this collection. To do them justice a real Mana collection would be at least a 4-CD set! This one is just an appetizer!"
3,"Good, but not ""my faves"" with Mana!","I find this cd, kind of boring, where is al their incredibly good rock alternatvie songs?, that is the reasons why they are the best rock bands ever, like ""Ana"", ""Robame el alma"" ""Antifaz"" ""Me voy a conventir en un ave"" and ""Me vale"" just to menitoed a few. But this is good, if u love their latin sounds, My faves here is with no doubt ""Clavado en un bar"" which was the first song I ever heard of Mana, ""Vivir sin aire"", ""No ha parado de llover"" and of course ""Rayando el sol"" the others are ok, but not that much in my cup of tea. If you never have heard Mana buy this, but remember buy their original cds, since they are the best!"
4,IDL in bits and pieces,"This book goes into more detail about IDL than most people care about. However if you start wondering why your interface is not being properly marshalled, knowing your IDL will save you from scratching your head in biwilderment.If you dont want any surprises from COM marshalling this is the book to get. Even in the .NET world, this book will be useful. All the COM components out there today are not just going to go away."
4,Much Revealed,"My oldest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"
3,Not The Best,"Spends way too much time on sanding skis, using klister, conditioning wooden skis among other outdated or rarely used items. Not a thorough enough book for the skiing enthusiast and not simple enough for the basic skier! Needs more time spent on the newer glide and kick waxes and their application. Plus the review of snow crystals is more complicated than it needs to be. Get ""Complete Guide to Cross Country Ski Waxing"" by Nat Brown its a better guide, especially valuable if you're an enthusiast."
5,Love it!,My two girls and I love this story. A great moral tale about the difference between generosity and humility versus greed and arrogance. The illustrations are also beautiful.
5,I am impressed!!!,I've been studying Muay Thai and Jiu Jitsu for a while and I just found out there is a Greek Martial Art so I decided to give this book a try. I am very impressed! The techniques can be applied to what I know and I definitely learned a lot. This is definitely one form of martial arts that I would reccommend.
5,A Great Book From a Greater Martial Artist,"The bottom line is that Jim Arvanitis was promulgating NHB training and techniques long before it was ""fashionable"". The book is a testament to his hard work. A work and a man deserving of respect."
2,Mu Tau Pankration,"THIS BOOK IS VERY LIMITED. THE TECHNIQUES ARE NOT ORIGINAL, THE PRICE IS NOT RIGHT WASTE OF TREES. MAYBEE THE AUTHOR WILL DO BETTER IN THE ADVANCED BOOK HE PROMISED TO PUBLISH LAST YEAR."
1,IT'S BORING AND IT REALLY SUCKS,"The only good thing about this game are the graphics. Other than that all you'll see is a pile of crap covered in radio-active material. Almost everything about this game is really bad. The missions are laughably bad(Example: while flying, keep the children at your side or you fail the mission), the flying controls really suck, the combat is clunky and very unreliable, and characters are very annoying. Not even kids should be allowed to play this travesty unless it's a cruel punishment for doing something bad."
2,BAD and GOOD,"This game is something that u don't want to spend too much time on. The Graphics are really good, but the game play just didn't appeal."
2,The Scorpion King is far from king.,"I recently got this game because I heard it was going to be like Castlevania:Cotm but, this game is a far cry from that game. The game is just so straight forward. It also features a password system simmilar to the Now-Classic Aladdin on the SNES. The game could have used the gameboy advances saving ability. The company apparently spent to hard to try to capture the Rock's looks than making everything come together. One last thing that bugs me is that the enemies are either Big Fat Arabs, snakes, bugs, or zombies.+ The Rock is in itGraphics are ok- Just about everything else"
1,STUPIDIEST GAME EVER,this is the stupidiest game ever. at the beginning its fun but then you get to a board where when you walk the floor falls in and you can't get to the other side. this was a total waste of 40bucks.
3,Cynthia Rothrocks body with Brinke Stevens voice ???,"Because I know the filmmakers and how this film came to be...Well,I survived. Stock footage of Cyntia Rothrock,voice over by BRINKE STEVENS and some very kewl walkons...Leo Fong and Stack Pierce. Tulare ,California was supposed to be what BIG city...Anybody know ? Lawsuits have arisen because of Rothrock paycheck or lack of."
4,"Good Soundtrack. Say You'll ""Be My Baby."" ""She's Like The Wind."" ""Hungry Eyes.""","The tracks ""Be My Baby,"" ""Do You Love Me?,"" ""Hungry Eyes,"" ""The Time Of My Life"" and the heart-wrenching ballad""She's Like The Wind"" (co-written and performed by Patrick Swayze) are reason enough to purchase this soundtrack. The remaining tracks aren't very good. ""She's Like The Wind"" is romantic and moving. Guys will be singing this to their wives for a long time. Makes for a great song at a wedding or a romantic dinner together followed by passionate and sincere lovemaking."
5,The Greatest Soundtrack to the Greatest Movie,"Dirty Dancing is my fav movie and music on it is so cool. The songs on this CD is great! The #1 one song one thing is ""Love Is Strange"" - ""Sylvia how do you call your loverboy!"" ""Oh loverboy!"""
5,Love the movie and the soundtrack!,"I first saw Dirty Dancing when I was 12 and since then I've watched it about a billion times! haha. its one of my favorites. I love all the music in it, its such happy music! :)"
2,Very disappointed,"The sound quality is not what it should be for a CD, in my opinion. I am very disappointed in both of the ""Dirty Dancing"" disks and wish I had not purchased them."
4,Missing a song??????,"The CD is great. My only problem with the ""soundtrack""????? is that it is missing one of the best songs from the movie.I have the CD, but was greatly dissappointed that one tune was missing. I don't know the title or artist, but I want and need that song. Can someone help me out with the missing tune?It was played the night that Jennifer Grey discovered the entire dance group at their cabin doing the greatest dirty dancing I've seen in a long time.Thanks to anyone who knows the tune."
5,Songbird2000,"This is definitely the ultimate cd. It is my best purchase to date. The combination of music is immaculate. My favourites are ""Some Kinda Wonderful"", ""Cry to Me"" and ""Yes"". This music rocks the soul. You just gotta to sing and dance when its playing. For those of you in love, looking for love or just love the great music of the 80's this is the cd for you. I have an eight year old niece that just loves this collection. I have the words to each song printed and boy you should hear us sing. So just sit back and allow the music to flow."
5,Dirty Dancing,"The CD is worth it, my husband loves it. He listens to it all the time. Brings back alot of memorys."
5,Worth while,Great CD! Would recommend it. If you love sound tracks then you will love this. All original songs. Good to have.
3,"Wow, the snare drum goes to 11!","This album has a bunch of tunes from the movie that are mostly well mixed. Mostly they are not to my taste, but the one song I was really looking forward to was the #1 track ""The Time of My Life"". Sadly, the remarkable singing of Jennifer Warren and Bill Medley ends up backing the remarkably uninspired snare drum of some anonymous session musician with his girlfriend on the maracas.The rest of the songs seem to be recorded with more balance.I recommend not buying this if your main interest is in track 1"
3,Gotta Love It,This Cd is cool. I went out and bought it as soon as i could. The tunes are happening and are great to listen to at sleepovers and just when iam on my own. Me and my friends quote all the best one liners and sing the songs even when the CD is not playing. What i like best about this CD is i know when the songs come into the movie. If you love this CD go out and get the Collector's Edition. It has 27 songs on it!!
2,average cd&movie,alot of hype for both the cd&film.which was overrated then and is now to this day.catchy but no real substance.who wants to hear hungry eyes? and even worse Patrick Swayze singing? very average at best.
5,Couldn't be better!,"""Dirty Dancing"" is an okay movie, but the soundtrack is awesome! The songs ""Be my Baby"", ""Hungry Eyes"", and ""She's like the Wind"" are my favorites. They are great to listen to if you're having a bad day. If you want to buy a great CD, I recommend buying this one. It's fabulous!"
4,This sountrack is a great addition to your cd collection!,"I've had the time of my life listening to this CD! Some people may like Korn and some people may like Motzart, but you just can't replace the good ol' oldies in this soundtrack. Some song from the movie aren't on the soundtrack which would be the only reason that i don't give this a five star reveiw! I love this soundtrack and when you hear it you just want to get up and dance! it is just the best thing that i have heard since the soundtrack animal house, there are no bad songs on this soundtrack, you will love it and it is a great christmas gift! Have the time of your life! Again"
3,My Opinion - subjective of course,"This is a good cd, especially if you like the music of the time setting this movie took place. Great music to work out (dance) to or drive with."
5,The c.d. was so excellent. It made me feel like dancing,The music was really awesome. It is probably the best soundtrack ever made.
5,The best movie with the best soundtrack!,"Dirty Dancing is my all time favorite movie. It has been my inspiration for dancing and acting, ever since I was a little girl. I still enjoy watching the movie, and singing and dancing along with the characters and the songs. This would be a great gift, for anyone you know, who enjoys the movie, and it's songs."
1,Product was defective. Has defect on CD,Received CD. Apeared to be in good condition. However upon playing it it was defective. There was a bad spot on CD so it just kept repeating and would not continue playing. Now i do not know how to return this defective product.
3,"I don't like it, but my girlfriend does","Personally, I thought that Jennifer Grey did a better job in Ferris Bueller, but what the hell, my girlfriend likes it, so I tolerate it. I just wish that Cris Farley would have made a cameo and done his Chippendales dance with Patrick (He's Soooo dreamy!)"
5,This C.D. has the best music ever!,My favorite song is the time of my life. I loved the dancing in the movie and it made me want to Dirty Dance as well!
2,"Actually, I only liked the first song :)","I must be the only person who absolutely hated this movie, but didn't mind the sound track. I actually don't think I've seen the movie all the way through, though I've been to Lake Lure where it was filmed...pretty place. But back to the soundtrack.....first song, a classic, and who could forget patrick swayze singing his own little song there :) Otherwise, the songs are older than me...and really don't interest me :)"
4,I find the treasures!,"Yes! i find! In this moment when the world music going for a crazy and a trash i find this great and increrabul moment( yes, moment! i relza completely when i listen these musics! ) i can't stop to dance! I puch my big tv 9 50 "") and i free dancing in my dinnerroom ( my tv stay always in this place...) That's Great! Love forever for all! ""who sing happy live ! """
1,all have I have to say is,"THIS bubblegum junk outsold the latest michael jackson release at the time Bad? what a joke, who the hell talks about the music on this soundtrack these days? And that patrick swayze song was alright but should have been given to someone else."
3,Music is good but,Would have liked the music the young dancers were dancing to in the big room after working hours when Babybrought the watermelon in and met Johnny.
5,The Greatest!,This is an all time classic! I love all of the songs on here and can think of what part of the movie they were played at.This is a must have for any Dirty Dancing fan!
3,NO CD AVAILABLE,I was surprised upon receiving the book that the CD was UNavailable as promised on the website. The price of the book droped also within 2 weeks from the date I purchased it from 97.2$ to 79$.
2,Inappropriately Titled Tome,"Having written many 8086 assembly language programs many years ago, and after having used PPC and SPARC chips for a number of years, I decided to purchase this book to refresh my knowledge of Intel assembler. I was very disappointed in the contents of this book. The title would suggest that the subject matter covered relates to writing Intel assembly language perhaps in a platform agnostic manner, however the book should rather be titled ""Assembly Language USING MASM for Intel based computers RUNNING WINDOWS"". The book does not even seem to acknowledge that there are other OSs apart from Windows that run on Intel based machines, and also makes use of features and peculiarities of the MASM assembler. If you are looking for a text that will assist you in writing assembler using MASM for Intel based machines running Windows then this is it, otherwise stay well clear, and try to find a text that is less partisan."
1,Will never use Irvine's books for my classes again!,"Sorry, but I have been teaching assembly language for over 15 years. I try to use Irvine's books, but the last thing I want my to do is use a book that ""dumb"" downs the students learning! I absolutely hate the include files and prewritten routines that Irvine uses. I want my student to write these and learn. Assembly language should not be ""easy"". I want my student to learn the hard, gut-level hard knocks writing of this language. That's when they understand the power of assembly!"
5,Great book,"This is a great book. I have to say that I know the author. However, my review is based on this book alone. I will never say something good or bad about a book because of a given author.I actually like the 5th edition better than the new one because it has more chapters. This is due that the new edition, while it has some important new features, it has some stuff online. I'm old school, so I like to have everything in paper.First, I have not been able to find an Assembly book so complete about Intel Architecture :) I also enjoy quite a lot the chapters about MS-Windows Programming and High-Level language! And how about the chapter ""Disk Fundamentals"" ... that's a GEM.I know some people complaint about the MASM... Well MASM is mature, but use anything... is not about MASM, is about the concepts...Other people say he uses library... well, don't use them...It is a great book!"

1,Good For An Antique Collection But Little Else,"This is the Newest edition of the classic Hebrew dictionary that is arranged by word root. It seems that the publishers of this new edition wanted to give it the classic antique look, as it is so famous. Although the cover looks nicer than the older edition, inside it is a different story. The typeface in the inside looks like it was typed with a typewriter a century ago, and is therefore very hard to read, even to those who are familiar with Hebrew. Also, the fact that it is arranged by word root makes it harder to find the words in it. For those looking to own their first Hebrew dictionary, I recommend ""The Vocabulary Guide to Biblical Hebrew"" by Van Pelt and Practico. Also, for those wanting a readable version of BDB, I have found that the one included in BibleWorks is pretty readable."
3,B and D for the Lay Person,I bought this for my husband who is a lay leader at our Temple. He finds it difficult to use.
5,Best Hebrew Lexicon I've used,This is a wonderful resource for a student of Biblical Hebrew. I used it all the time in college and couldn't have gotten through my Hebrew classes without it. Make sure you get the index by Bruce Einspahr too.
3,"Good for amateurs and advanced levels, not beginners","It's a good book for those who already know hebrew and want to improve themselves. To find out the meaning of a word in the Hebrew bible using this book, you need to know its root, which is very difficult for beginners. I would recommend for a beginner to buy a lexicon that explains every single word as it is without the need to go to the root."
5,the only hebrew lexicon,"THIS LEXICON HAS BEEN THE NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDED BIBLICAL HEBREW TOOL BY ALL HEBREW EXPERTS THAT I HAVE WORKED WITH. IF YOU KNOW HOW TO READ HEBREW AND YOU LOVE TO WORK WITH THE BIBLE, YOU MUST HAVE THIS TOOL IN YOUR LIBRARY. THIS IS THE BEST HEBREW LEXICON YOU CAN BY. (NOTE ALL WORDS TO BE LOOKED UP ARE IN HEBREW)"
5,"An Excellent Reference, but knowing Hebrew would make for easier use","This is an excellent reference source in lexicons. However, it translates from Hebrew to English, and so the best way to use it, if you don't know Hebrew, is to cross reference it with Strong Exhaustive Concordance. The lexicon is indexed to the Strong's concordance, to make it possible to look up the words in English."
4,The New Brown DB Lexicon,Thank for your service in sending this book. It came in very good condition.
4,A Welcome Addition to My Library,"BDB is recommended at the end of a Hebrew primer for adults that I often consult. I agree with other reviewers that BDB requires a fundamental knowledge of Hebrew. If you already have a familiarity with Hebrew, and if you enjoy deep reading of the Tanakh, BDB is an essential resource.As an example, I used BDB to research the etymology of the root ""bet-kuf-resh"". BDB led me on a fascinating journey that led me eventually to Psalms and the Shulchan Oruch! At the end of it I had a fair amount of good material for a devar torah.I have one reservation on BDB. As with many of the older lexicons, BDB was written before the discovery of Ugaritic (i.e., prior to 1930). Study of Ugaritic etymologies has added enormously to our knowledge of obscure Hebrew words. I anxiously await the arrival of a single-volume biblical lexicon that incorporates Ugaritic!"
2,thought it was interlinear,"i thought it was interlinear but its not, im sure its great for what it is but wasnt what i wanted, my fault"
4,Good Product,"I have had this toy for a month or two now and I have not found any faults yet. Its functioning well,I must say that overall it was money well spent. Good product.."
3,Far Stretch on many of his posited theories,"Carroll does an interesting job of trying to explain a geometrical calculus related to his magic principles. While not altogether convincing, he sets in motion (with candor) the ideas of attaining magical goals through gnostic equations. This is no new idea, in itself, and has been manipulated and used to various ends by every magical agenda, to some extent, but Carroll finds an interesting way of wording things.I can honestly say that this book is a decent complimentary novel to Liber Nox/Psychonaut. While its theories and applications I do not altogether agree with or fully grasp, I can understand its spark of interest in readers.The one suggestion I have is to read this novel with an analytic mindset or you're apt to be carried off by his dilliniations in physics and mathematics without ever understanding the original principles that his dilliniations were taken from. And of course, ""Reader beware."""
5,Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.,"The mind subject ov the book: BELIEVE. After that, everything comes as easy as the infamus kingdom of heaven came to Jesus. Ja,ja,ja."
5,Essential For The Serious Student,"Less than 3% of all books on magic are worth reading. LIBER KAOS is one of them. The first part of the book attempts to explain magick in terms of quantum physics and chaos theory(interesting...that's all I can say). The second part of the book however,cuts straight to the nitty gritty of how to do magick properly to get results. Step by step procedure stripped of all religious, supersticious, and cultural symbolism and baggage. If you do not study these principles and use them you are shooting yourself in the foot."
3,Good but wordy,"I do in fact like this book. However, I feel that a great deal of energy was spent by the author in a mixture of trying to show us how intelligent he is (I.E. crazy math equations he made up), and trying to over complicate simple concepts. Although I feel both of these are true, it is a good book if you can read around those bits. If you are not new to magic, I would suggest skipping to the practical section of the book. You will miss some clever things you may enjoy, but its a lot less annoying than reading his pointless sections like math equations he made up to try to show magic can be proven scientifically. If you are new to magic....I still suggest doing the same. Still good practical section though, worth a read."
1,Broken in Shipping,This was a video tape shipped in it's sleeve and brown paper wrapping. The video got broken in the mail. I felt the item should have been better protected before being shipped. I did get my refund after I returned broken tape.
3,"Warren is the movie,Sountrack is outstanding,Vera is good",Leslie Ann Warren is great...Julia Roberts fair...Billy Vera is good...The music is perhaps the best overall thing that holds you...I would think the soundtrack will be the most memorable part.
2,Where's The Rest Of It?,"I saw this movie on cable and loved it. I was very happy to find out that it was on video, but when I rented the VHS I was surprised to find that some Hollywood lunkhead thought the thing would move faster if they edited out all the really good parts. The VHS made no sense. I want to see the movie I saw first...please...somebody put it onto a DVD. I'll buy it."
4,Great book!,I read this book for a school project. I had to learn about the culture in Vietnam. The book went into great detail about the culture and the way people live there. It told true stories about the people who went through the war. Great book for young readers who want to know about the war.
2,Barry makes it sound like this was the most boring war ever!,I guess that this book was okay. I didn't really like it. I thought it was quite boring at most parts. It was a struggle for me to even reach the end of the book!
1,CRAP,"I didn't like this book because it was hard to find out what was really going on, and it was extremely confusing in most of the book. It was like waiting for paint to dry, but doing that would be more fun than reading this horrible book."
3,Too big,"These are gorgeous stalkings but one size most certainly does not fit all. I am 5'2"" and 125lbs and they were much much too big for me. It was nothing some cutting and sewing couldn't fix, but if you're little and can't mend you own clothing i dont recommend these. That being said, they were exactly what i was looking for, and now that i have re sized them i absolutely love them."
2,Definitely not one-size fits all.,"I'm not a big girl at all, 5'2"", average size. A little bottom heavy but not crazy. These things were SO tight on my thighs I couldn't wear them. They fit fine except for a very tight band around the top. Couldn't wear them at all, very disappointing."
5,HIGH ENERGY,"This is a grat single! I've been trying to find it for about a month and now I have it! I love this song, and I suggest you buy it!"
1,Same Old Stuff,"John seems to have one outline that he simply fills in different illustrations. He can only ride this horse so long. It is time for him to update his material. This book does not accomplish that. Sorry, I like him on the platform, but his writings are getting stale."
1,Too little substance,"While the author seems well-intentioned, the book is very superficial. It seems to be recycled bromides and platitudes, connected by anecdotes and quotes, and punctuated by occasional exaggeration (like ""everything rises and falls on leadership"" - everything?). There are hundreds of leadership books with more meat."
5,Thought provoking - yet easy read,"I have found this book to be very thought provoking and a great tool to benchmark your existing leadership skills against. It also reminds you of your values that may have been affected by the pressure of leadership.Good for beginners, intermediate and proven leaders."
3,Good Read,"I read this in one sitting, couldnt put it down. A lot of this book is common sense, but not commonly put into practise. Knowlege can be applied in any avenue of your life.good read."
4,Good,"The book gives practical, digestible essence of leadership. This makes it much better to digest as one can read and not be overwhelmed with pages upon pages of info that will keep you from reading it.The points are specific, he uses stories to highlight the quality, as well as some practical ideas/recommendations for each quality. It also gives you a suggested way to read as one should not try to read it in one sitting, but read one quality and meditate/live it for a day to have it sink in."
4,Good Reference for the Leader,"Maxwell's title focuses on 21 qualities needed for successful leadership and devotes a chapter summarizing each quality. While I tend to agree with others that Maxwell's books sometimes can be simplistic and full of hype, this particular title is a timely read in light of the ...failures the world has seen in the areas of politics, business, and religion.Some of the helpful pointers Maxwell offers include:1. Ways to improve your listening.2. Improving your problem-solving ability.3. 3 things needed to cultivate better relationships with others.4. Traits of insecure leaders.5. Ways to improve your teachability.6. Ways to improve your servanthood.7. Imroving your discernment.8. Cultivating generosity with others.In my opinion, this title is better than some of Maxwell's other books because of the focus on character.All in all, a good read. While Maxwell is an authority on leadership and has a readable writing style, there are better authors and books out there!"
4,"Once Again, It just needed to be said!","The book was a compilation of items that everyone should be doing to be a leader. Maxwell, as usual, brings this to our attention. We need to get more of our positional leaders to follow some of these words."
1,Can I get my money back??!!,"Dear John Maxwell, I didn`t need to know about how good leader you are, about your organization and that material anyone could come out with. I made a mistake buying this book, at least I learned not to buy another one you had written.Dear friend who wants to buy a book on leadership, I was once in your shoes, if I could turn back time I would have appreciated if somebody had told me: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
1,Useless,"I bought this book on Maxwell's reputation and when it arrived it was little more than a pamphlet of cute little anecdotes you could get via email chainmail. This book appears to follow a standard format of Maxwell's and he tries to use what has worked in the past. It can't make a leader and doesn't offer substantial instruction or insights.Each chapter gives a short story that attempts to highlight the leadership quality of the chapter. Shortly thereafter a few self-examination points are discussed that nearly anyone could hvae written. This was truly useless and disappointing.At best, it may wet the appetite to go learn more from a non-Maxwell book or serve as a conversational ice breaker at professional development courses. As a stand alone tool though, it is of little value to anyone who knows anything already about leading people."

1,"While the Leor may not be awesomely enlightened, they do not need to be boringified","I was feeling really uncertain about picking up this book after the last one with the Leor subplot. The thing is that they are an interesting if not particularly likeable species. I hated Lani with a passion in her earlier appearances, so while she only shows up a few times in this one, they were enough to color my entire perception of the books. Basically, by the end of the book, the writer is getting rid of all the alien 'barbaric' parts of the Leor culture. If you will allow me a nerd moment, it just like that DS9 did to the Ferengi. Ugh I hated that. While the relationship between Jenna and Arion is sweet enough. They never seem to really learn to know each other so their relationship is a bit lacking in depth. I basically skimmed it to get to the end and see to what extent the author would ruin the Leor. She does a pretty good job of it :)"
1,Very Poor!,"Up to now I've been enjoying Baxt's Hollywood mysteries, but this particular one was written extremely poorly. It was disjointed and made no sense. And Garbo seemed like a cardboard cutout - there was no life to her at all. The premise was a good one - espionage in Hollywood after the bombing of Pearl Harbour, but it went absolutely nowhere. It was so unmemorable that I don't even remember the names of the lead characters who were at the heart of the conspiracy. I do hope that the others remaining in the series get back to the old format that the first four books had."
5,A GREAT BEAT-EM UP!!!!!!,"When I picked up this game the other day, I wasn't too sure what to expect. I saw pictures of this game and it looked great.So, I popped it into my ps2 and i was blown away!! The graphics are great! The gameplay resembles that of the bouncer and State of emergency. You get different weapons with special functions, and a whole lot more!! The game runs smoothly with no slow daown whatsoever. If you're a fan of fighting games, Then go get this game right now!!!!"
5,Under rated Gem,"This game is a classic that wasn't really heard of. A game that was unfortunately released at a time when bigger named games were released. Controls are a bit of a hassle to get used to, but once you get accustomed to them, the game is great fun. I recommend it to anyone who has a thing for either anime styled games or action/beat 'em up/hack n' slash games in general. You wont be disappointed."
1,Bad Controls and Bland Storyline Make This Game A Miss!,Let me first say that this game is better than State of Emergency although not by much. The controls are absolutely horrible. I found myself spending more time trying to make jumps and climbing down ladders without falling and dying than actually fighting. The enemy characters are generic and are not the brightest enemies in the videogame world. I think those ghost on old-school pacman and the Mad Gear thugs of Final Fight are a whole lot smarter. And the main character's girlfriend is very annoying perhaps more annoying than the controls. The storyline is right out of some low budget cheap ripoff made for television [stuff] you'd see on the scifi channel too often. I suggest renting this game first!
3,A Decent PS2 Release,"Let me start by saying that E.O.E. is a fun game. There's a good storyline, but not so much that it takes away from the gameplay. The game is very action based and a lot of good old fashioned beating people up. There are some cool and unique weapons that have special powers and the levels so far (I am only 3 levels into the game) are pretty decent. The main thing to remember about this game is that it is fun to play. If you're looking for an epic storyline than this game is not it. But if you're looking for constant action and killing bad guys than you should like this game too.The bad sides: The camera controls are one of the most annoying you will ever see... But, if you can ignore it, then you got a decent arcade type game to play."
1,Utter crap!,"Name says it all. This game is not challenging, predictable, and is at times more vague than Bush's sobriety. I had to purchase this game for a class. The assignment was to take a less than favorable game, play it, andwrite any changes we'd make. Needless to say there was a laundry list of changes. I was one of two people in my group to finish the game. Don't waste your time and money with this game. It's not even good to play stoned. Get something else, like Burnout:Takedown, Halo 3, or God of War. There are much better games out there than this."
2,Not a game worth playing,"Ok, first off, the plot is given to you flat out. The game play is horrible and it gets boreing after, oh, 2 seconds. Do not even rent it, it's not worth it."
5,"very thorough,in depth explanation of every aspect training","Podhajsky spent his whole life training horses and he is also adept at communicating all his knowledge to the reader. This book includes a step by step guide to each aspect of training the horse, from walk trot to passage and piaffe."
5,complete training of horse and rider,This is a must read for any aspiring horseman or horsewoman. It is detailed and written in a format that is easy to understand and comprehend. Each section gives detailed explainations on building your seat for balance and what your horse needs to be in balance with you as a rider.
5,One of the best...,"equestrian-related books I have read. Most of it confirmed what I already knew (but its always nice to know you're doing it right), but the tidbits of ""new"" stuff were invaluable. And I found it emphasized three main points 1) establish and maintain forwardness, 2) take your time to do it right, don't take short cuts, and 3) the horse's well-being (both mentally and physically) is paramount.I also very much enjoyed the final section on the Spanish Riding School, including how they train the Airs and the history of the School. One warning: it will likely be dry for those not truly interested in producing a well-trained, very responsive mount. I also tried to read it in small doses, so I could process the information. But it is a MUST for all dressage riders."
5,Complete training of horse and rider,Classic that deserves to be on every horseowner's bookshelf. Wished I'd have read this gem long ago.
5,Best role I have ever seen Burt Reynolds in!,"I love this movie! I rented it on it's release date and watched it 3 times...Then I rented it again 2 weeks later so more of my family could see it! I found the story line and characters very moving. It is a real portrayel of faith, forgiveness, and the gift of grace! It is one of those movies that makes you laugh, makes you cry, and, perhaps most of all, makes you realize how important love and forgiveness is to each of us and to families in general. A truly uplifting, must see movie."
4,Heavenly Surprise,This movie is just a wonderful piece of human drama that echos with a heavenly chorus of redemption. If there is any movie that will move the heart this is it. The section on the making of Waterproof was such a wonderful bit of info that it is a must to review.
5,TRULY UPLIFTING AND INSPIRING!,"Wow, this film is incredible! I just finished watching it about twenty minutes ago (I got it as a Christmas present from my par...er, Santa Claus). It's been awhile since I've seen a film so uplifting. The story was written perfectly, and the acting performances were exceptional. This is, by far, Burt Reynold's best performance. A great tale of family, faith, and forgiveness that no one should miss! Grade: A+*NOTE: Most of the film was shot in the city of Wilmington, in my home state of North Carolina."
2,Slow..Boring,"I purchased the DVD, watched and felt so much bored and slow.I sold it back on Ebay. B-Movie."
4,WATERPROOF,"SLOW MOVIE WITH BURT REYNOLDS IN IT, NOT A LOT OF ACTION BUT QUITE A BIT OF DRAMA. EARLY MOVIE WHEN HE WAS STILL DOING WHAT EVER CAME HIS WAY. HE STILL DOES THAT BUT HE HAS ACHIEVED SUPER STAR STATUS DISPITE SOME OF HIS EARLY MOVIES. INTERESTING MOVIE WITH MANY TWISTS TO IT."
5,Insightful and informative,"It has been two years since I read this book, but I see it hasn't had a review yet, and I think it deserves one, so I add my two bits.A very detailed analysis of the developments in rural Chinese society over a period of massive upheaval. Provides tremendous insight into the social mechanisms at play, and the interplay of contemporary political movements with the traditional power structures in rural China. For anyone interested in or involved in rural development in China, a drama which is still going on in the 21st century, a must read. Also recommended for anyone interested in the interactions between policy-directed, centrally planned development and the way society responds to it.Would like to see a similar follow up on the years between the cultural revolution and the present."
4,"Dame Cleo, stripped","Forget the frills and the 5-octave range, this is Dame Cleo stripped to the bare essentials. There is untold honesty in the singing of first class songs, old and new. Listen to her rendition of Indian Summer in this album and compare it with the version she recorded in 1958. There is no stopping Dame Cleo. She just gets better and better. The backing musicians are superb and the inclusion of the Dankworths' self-penned Dry Martini is appetizing to say the least. After listening to the earlier That Old Feeling album, I had been wishing for a similar follow-up. My wish has been granted. Thank you, Amazon.com for having this in your catalogue, without which, I would have missed out on a real gem."
2,somehow got worse after N64's ISS 98.,"Bad news first: International Teams - they used to use fake names, now everything is fake - no real uniforms, players aren't based on anything real, and somehow the U.S. is the best international team.Gameplay: no shoulder tackles like in ISS 98, the line-up menus are more difficult to navigate through, and the gameplay isn't as fast as it used to be.Good news - if you're a big MLS fan - it has all the stadiums and players.But, I like my international play, and hate EA's FIFA series. What am I to do?"
3,This game is not as bad as I previously thought,This agme is not as good as Fifa 99 or striker pro 2000 which I like very much. It is not a bad game either. I like it.I think it's worth the money.
3,Whatever Happened to Mark Lindsay?!,Arizona put on your Indian braids! Love his music and time! Where did he go?! Highly Recommend!
4,Satisfactory,The battery works fine and appears to be an equivalent product to the Casio original. The plastic wrapping is a little sloppy which makes the battery look a little unprofessional and give slight trouble inserting into the camera. Those issues are worth dealing with in light of the cost savings in my opinion.
4,will likely last forever,"It is heavy and it takes 10 minutes to heat up, but it produces very nice grill marks and that mass provides even heat. I preheat the grill on high on the stovetop for steaks, and preheat the oven at the same time to about 300. Brown the steaks quickly once the griddle is hot, then place in oven to finish unless you prefer rare. Nice grill marks, and the griddle is easy to pick up (but hot and heavy and you need good mitts) when the grill side is up. However, when the grill side is down (the smooth side is up) this griddle is darn hard to lift off the stove top because the handles are flush with the stove top if you have a glass top stove. I have to slide a thin spatula under the edge to pry it up enough to lift it off the stove top. This is a tricky task especially if the griddle is hot."
2,Rusty Griddle,The griddle did not come with directions on how or if it needed to be seasoned. It rusted after the first use.
1,Heavy,"I realize cast iron is heavy, which is why I only keep a few essential cast iron items in my kitchen. This thing weighs a ton! It arrived in a flimsy broken box that was not strong enough to contain the item. I didn't like the way it looked - it was rougher/scratchier looking compared to other cast iron items I have. I returned it. Also, lastly please note the return label was USPS (not UPS). Items this heavy have to be taken to the post office...not fun standing on a long line carrying this thing."
3,DSGB!! BLESS AMERICA!!,"if your a pastor troy fan, like me, then this album is just like FACE OFF. nothing spectacular, but he has his own style which is why we buy his music. i listen to it, but his last 2 albums aren't the same PT from his underground days, PASTOR TROY FOR PRESIDENT and WE READY, etc. track 4 with BUN B is decent, but BUN needs to come with a different verse, he says the same thing in almost every song. i must say that track 15, BLESS AMERICA, ABOUT 9/11, GAVE ME CHILLS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT. dont want to spoil it, but it is well done with a good chorus, and lyrics--must have--it almost makes it worth getting for just that song. but, can only give it a 3, cause after 3 days, i only found myself listening to TRACK 15. so if you like him, go get it; if you don't even know who he is, and just want to check it out, my advice would be to borrow a friends."
2,O MANNN,"I never really liked the Pastor Troy's style. I gave this CD a chance because his last CD really caught me and the song Champion is stuck in my head. So I got this album. Production is the greatest thing on this album. Pastor Troy basically talks or screams out WAR CRYs on some songs and he didn't rhyme sometimes. However there are decent songs, just not enough to carry the CD.ProductioN: B+Lyrics: C+Delivery: COverall: B-"
2,man what happened?,I was trying to listen to this cd... but after carefully listening to all the tracks and based off his classics We REady I declare war and Face off ( I won't mention I am DSGB cuz I wont) man this is the wackest cd ever came out by him... I lost respect when I heard his commercialized lyrics and beats. What happened to you Troy?
3,troy SWITCHED UP STYLE?(2.5 stars really),"This CD is not too bad. But Troy switched his style up into more of a ""mainstream/club"" style, which I'm not feelin from him. Here are some of the songs that I'm refering to: Are We Cuttin, Tell'em its on, and chug-a-lug. Those songs I mentioned just sound TOO BLAND. The only reason this CD has gotten as many stars as it did, is cause some of his original style songs like:If they kill me, ""who what when where"", and If I wasn't rappin. There are some other decent songs but those are the best. If you are a Pastor Troy fan I'd say LISTEN TO THIS CD BEFORE YOU BUY IT. And if you are a REALLY big Pastor fan and like it enough get it, if it is TOO MUCH a disapoinment then just drop it and don't buy it."
1,This movie is mon-crazy!!!,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand, it's an enjoyable kids movie that's somewhat entertaining. On the other hand, it sends a very negative message to our youth. It's all fun and games until halfway through the movie where Dodger gains mutant powers from eating a toxic banana after sneaking into a government bio engineering plant and decides to use his powers for evil rather than good. Eva gets sick and Dodger decides to rob a bank to pay the medical bills. Jean Claude Van Dam is a special forces agent working to stop the monkey in time (I think he's a pretty good actor). There is a plot twist that's somewhat good but I won't spoil it here. I recommend picking up ""Slam Dunk Ernest"" instead."
3,"Great for the Kids, not so much for adults.","This is a great babysitting movie for the children. It's just not geared towards the adult mind. Mimi Rogers does an okay job, but nothing stellar. Harvey Keitel does a slightly better job as a con man with a monkey and an organ grinder. Again, the kids will watch it over and over again for the cute monkey, so this film has it's value in that regard. It's free of foul language or any off color innuendo, so Monkey Trouble is safe."
4,Cute movie!,"This was a cute movie-and it's pretty good all except for a few words. If you have the TV Guardian, then this will be acceptable for all ages to see. It's funny. Eva hides a monkey who is the pet of a crook and has been taught to steal. Eva is getting blamed for the robberies, and when she tells people that it's her monkey causing the trouble, even her parents won't believe her! :0 All in all, it's a great movie and remember, everything is not as it looks."
4,Fun family movie with a cute star,"This is a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy together. The star is a monkey named Dodger who is amazingly well trained. He is not really bad- he's just been trained to do bad things by his gypsy owner (Harvey Keitel who has a lot of fun with the villan role). The kids in this movie are cute, especially the younger brother, and the locations around the L.A. area are beautiful. There's also some interesting comparisons between the monkey's family unit and the little girls."
2,Okay if you're bored,"Though advertised as a ""splendid family film,"" the cuteness was spoiled by non-stop bad attitudes throughout the film. There were some funny scenes, but our kids (who are usually very easy to please) were not that impressed. Save your money for Because of Winn-Dixie or MVP (Most Valuable Primate)."
2,Yuck,"This product stinks. Whatever you think I mean, you are correct. Leaves a bit of a greasy feel and the smell makes me nauseous. I can only descibe it as an ""old hair-tonic"" odor, like something my grandfather may have used. I just threw away a near-new tube. If you don't like that stiff feel, this may be okay for you. I just couldn't get past the ""fragrance."""
5,great book with easy to understand explanations,"Starting back up in the dark room after 12 years I needed some refreshing and bought this book. It is great for beginners or those to need to refresh their memories. Easy to understand, going through the process step-by-step."
4,Nice shirt,"Yeah these are actually comfortable and they look good. The only thing is that the green do not look as good as it is in the picture, but I guess they are good for the price..."
3,Eddie Paul's Extreme Chopper Building:,"This book, although very interesting, serves very little pratical purpose for those of us who are interested in building a chopper we can ride every day. The book only describes one outrageous, (and by outrageous, I mean WILD!), bike that Eddie built in five days, for what purpose, I have no earthly idea. All said, it's a cool bike, Eddie, and I love that double blown, big block Chevy, but would rather have it in a car, a 'vette or '68 Camero, or even an ""A"" '32 coupe, for that matter, (open hood, of course). If, perchance, Eddie reads this, I would be very interested in knowing if you've actually ridden this beast, and if so, how far? Could you even control this monster through the 1/4 mile? Not sorry I bought the book... keep it up Eddie, MJ"
5,Great scent!!,I gave this as a gift and it was very well received. He loved it and he smelled great after he put it on.
2,DISAPPOINTED,BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS ONLINE... I WENT 2 MACY'S AND SPRAYED IT ON... LOVE IT... PURCHASE FROM U... DOES NOT SMELL THE SAME...!!!... I PURCHASE 2 BOTTLES ... NOT HAPPY AT ALL... VERY UNHAPPY CAMPER.... SEXUAL....!!!..JAMES........jwdisnuke@att.net
5,A co-worker was wearing this..............,This is one of the sexiest smells I have and I seriously could sit around all day smelling this cologne.I followed my co-worker around all day until he told me to stop.I ordered it the next day.
3,B52's served with a side of wasabi,"This is an off beat recording that's fun from start to finish. While fans of the B52's and the 1980's Japanese group, the Plastics, will be in absolute heaven, (In fact, memembers of both bands, along with the singer Yuki, from JUDY & MARY, make up NINA) other listeners will enjoy it for it's weirdly crafted alternative power pop. This was a big hit in Japan and it's easy to see why. HAIRSPRAY, OLD DELHI and ROUTE 246 are old skool new wave tunes that sound like long lost B52's tracks. AURORA TOUR and HAPPY TOMORROW, which were the album's two hit singles, are totally sweet and smile inducing. Although most of the music contains a sugary center, the centerpiece of the album, however, is the haunting I REMEMBER YOU, a heart breaking lament sung beautifully by Kate Pierson. Give it a spin!!"
2,If it weren't for Kate...,"Lord that girl from Judy and Mary sucks. This project was a real loser except for Kate Pierson. She saves it completely. I live in Tokyo and really don't like J-POP since most of the singers are of the same calibre as this girl. Only buy this CD if you are a huge fan of Kate Pierson, like myself."
3,RERUNS?,Seems that the recording is excerpts from elsewhere. The waltzes were better in their original contextys. I don't have four more words that are required.
1,Didn't even last a week.,"I recently bought a truck. I love my truck. Unfortunately, the handle on my truck had been broken before i bought it. Not a problem - the truck is 20 years old! So i did some Amazon research and found this Dorman handle. It was easy to install, it wasn't too expensive, and it was shipped quickly. HOWEVER, the handle seriously didn't even last a week. It snapped during the first day that i really needed to use it (moving a bunch of junk)... the wimpy metal handle snapped on its little arm that pushes down the tough metal innards. i'm disappointed."
3,gel seat,I ordered this for my wife. She isn't complaining about her uncomfortable seat anymore. I only wish the seat encouraged her to ride more often. LOL
2,Double Laptop Case,"The case is ok as long as you don't put the power chords in there with two laptops, as it will not snap close if you do.The leather has more of a cheap plastic look and is very disappointing."
2,Its Halsten not Halston,"I just received this laptop case. I thought it was going to be an upscale designer product (Halston). It is in fact, an okay, leather case, however, the way it is marketed (can't see the price until you place it in the cart) gives the impression that it is something very expensive that you are getting at a great price. It is a basic leather case nothing more and so far (I haven't used it yet) nothing less. I plan to keep it and see how good it really is!"
4,Great Bargain Book,"This review is specific to the Modern Library hardback. You probably know ""A Christmas Carol,"" but you may not be familiar with ""The Chimes"" or ""The Haunted Man.""According to the introduction, Charles Dickens wrote a Christmas story every year after the success of ""A Christmas Carol."" This edition includes two of those tales as well. If you are a Dickens, or 19th century English literature, fan, you will probably enjoy those stories. Noticeably missing from the book is ""Cricket on the Hearth.""Overall, the book has nice paper, text, and a great little biographical introduction. I will definitely look for more Modern Library titles."
2,Chipped within a year,"While it worked this knife was great and I loved its clean cut. Then, less than a year after I got it, it chipped on the cutting edge while I was cutting a butternut squash. It had to be thrown away as it seemed unsafe to use after that so it wasn't a good purchase for me. I'd look for a different brand next time."
5,It just keeps getting better,"These four episodes not only capture cards but also give us greater insight into Sakura's family and friends. The last one with her grandfather meeting her is both sad and sweet because she never learns who he is. Another episode isn't what the background note claims: Sakura's brother doesn't dress like a girl to impress his best male friend, its part of the gender reversal of a high school play! Its so sad that American television edited these so much, the relationships between characters may cross gender lines, age lines, and het lines but they are the most interesting part of the show. I'm so glad my spouse got me to watch these with him."
4,great!,"great movie! you all just hafta have it! get it while it's in supplies ppls, cause you don't wanna miss this movie of ccs!"
1,Not reliable,"I loved this sub woofer when I first bought it. It lasted about 2 months and then kept shutting down. many, many fixes later, (all under warranty), I would say that this amp just isn't any good. Wish I could get rid of it."
4,Perfect birthday gift,"With her favorite color being pink and her having few pieces of jewelry, this was the perfect gift for a favorite friend of mine. The workmanship was great and the color and clarity of the main tourmaline stone was outstanding. Although the diamonds were small they definitely helped the the ring catch in sunlight when outside. The ring design is simple, yet very elegant, and my friend (and HER friends) thought it was very beautiful.The item I ordered was actually size 5. She has small hands, but not size 4 small!"
2,Negative review of Snackbar Budapest,"Compared to other Tinto Brass good bright sexy movies this is poorly made. Stupid gang violence story line, bad dialoge and the video poor quality. No charachters here.I love Giancarlo Gianini, but his talent was wasted here. Just a bunch of girls running around. Don't waste your money. Rent/buy: The Key, Frivolous Lola, Miranda, Cheeky etc...."
5,Big ideas from a little man(no fault of his own),"If you are a fan or devotee of this performer, then this is Chaney at the height(no pun intended)of his long and distinguished career. In my humble opinion, there has never been, nor will there ever be an actor of his magnitude. It is too bad that Jr., will only be remembered as Larry Talbot:("
5,good price on some classic books,"books that are still pertinant to todays christian reader even though written decades ago, requested as a christmas gift by my twenty year old college student"
4,Very insightful introduction from the 1912 edition,"E. de Selincourt's 1912 introduction is very insightful, and there's a useful glossary and critical notes in the back, which, unfortunately, make them cumbersome to access. The complete, original text is included, however, all in one book, making this a very worthwhile reference."
3,bailalo gozalo,"Great tunes here ... great cuban production. Merengue in the style of kinito, salsa a la charanga habanera, and some weak bachata ... FIESTA !!!"
4,Weeds,"Best book on weeds that I've found so far in terms of pictures. Still, some pictures are not very good lighting-wise making it tough to discern the leaf shapes. The information concerning each plant can be sparse. It seems almost 25% of the book is partitioned for grasses which was disappointing because there are other books that can be purchased that are devoted to grasses alone.Not being a scholar or and expert on plants (just a curiosity to me), it seems that they've missed a few that I've found in other books. Maybe because those missing plants would be in a different category and not specifically ""weeds"" whatever that definition was for this book (I didn't read the introduction).All and all, I'm happy with the book. I discovered the names of many plants growing in my area through the use of this book, and I recommend it."
1,Nice pictures but that's all,"Ever try to look up a word in a 600 page dictionary that isn't in any order known to you? Unless you know this book's secret you'll have to look through the entire book to find your weed, if it's in the book at all. There is a key on page 603 but no instructions on how to use it and the author apparently doesn't return email inquiries. This book is full of great pictures but if you want a book to help you identify a weed in your garden look somewhere else."
5,this is a great book for weed indentification,"WEED LOVERS ALERT!!!HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO IDENTIFY A WEED? HAVE YOU ALWAYS LOVED THOSE NASTY LITTLE WEEDS IN YOUR GARDEN AND WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE? WELL, IF YOU LIVE IN THE WEST AND CAN ANSWER YES TO ONE OR MORE OF THESE QUESTIONS, WEEDS OF THE WEST JUST MIGHT BE THE BOOK YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR! WEEDS OF THE WEST OFFERS FULL COLOR PHOITOGRAPHS, WHICH IS HANDY IF YOU'VE EVER WONDERED WHAT NIPPLEWORT LOOKS LIKE, OR PERHAPS LOWLAND CUDWEED IS MORE YOUR STYLE. IT ALSO HAS INFORMATION ON THE LIFE CYCLE OF EACH WEED AND WHERE YOU CAN FIND IT, THOUGH MOST OF US DON'T CARE WHERE THE WEEDS ARE AS LONG AS THEIR NOT IN OUR YARDS. THIS BOOK ALSO TELLS YOU WHERE THE WEED ORIGINATED SO YOU CAN PLACE BLAME ON AND NEVER VISIT THOSE NATIONS THAT BROUGHT THE LOVELY THINGS OVER. THIS IS A GREAT WEED BOOK AND I RECCOMEND YOU USE IT IF YOU EVER GET A CHANCE."
5,Really good book- worth your money,"I'm a high school student. I have tried many stuff out there for SAT. But... because English is my foreign language, it's hard for me to remember all those vocabs. Rock the SAT makes learning vocabs so much more fun and easy. The music are quite similar to what I usually listen to. But don't espect the songs to be exactly like what you listen to normally... They are really good for vocab songs. In the end, if you are willing to learn something... This book will help you a lot."
5,IT REALLY WORKS!!!,"Rock the SAT is an unbelievable study tool...I gave the CD to my 15 year old niece to listen to, and later that very same night at the dinner table she used the word ""jejune"" in a sentence. I almost spit up my food...Thank you so much for introducing this product to the world. I only wish this was around when I took the SAT's."
4,Great Buy,"At first, I thought the songs were a little cheesy and was pretty reluctant to listen to it. However, I gave the CD a shot and found that I actually liked many of the songs; after listening to it only 3 days, I feel that my vocabulary has expanded. I suggest you buy this, Up your score, and the college board book."
2,pretty corny,"The music is pretty corny on this cd if you want to know the truth. I'm not a parent. I'm a student. And I couldn't get down with this. Sorry to the people who made it, but that's just how I feel."
1,Rock the SAT,"The product was suppose to come with a CD, it was not there. Guess that is what I get for buying used."
4,interesting...,"It's a lot more fun than the other SAT books/flashcards out there, I must say. As an avid music listener, the music isn't amazing, but it works. The words range from really easy (moasic, parallel) to difficult (the first song - reticence, taciturn, laconic). You can prevew a song on the Rock the Sat website too.There's also Vocab Rock, and it uses more than one genre of music - it had R&B; and everything else, not just rock music like this book. I haven't tried it yet, but I'm thinking about getting it."
5,Real Alternative Rock by Real Rockers with Degrees,"This book/cd set is well written, easy to follow, fun to read and will make learning the esoteric SAT words a pleasure rather than a chore. I've seen these guys play in NYC on Bleecker Street, and they are the real deal. The music and words are very catchy and memorable, and before you know it, you will be telling your friends they are solipsistic egomaniacs. And maybe they'll be contrite and buy you lunch."
1,Don't Bother,"Magnificent production values cannot rescue an utterly lame, unbelievable script. The love interest is a scrawny, fat-lipped model who looks like 1000 others. Never has the adorable Amanda been more missed. Add the inexcusable waste of Peter Wingfield and Jim Byrnes, and you have no reason to buy this bore-flick. One star for photography, music and costumes. And I'm a devoted Highlander fan."
3,A rebound movie,This moive was made for one purpose. To apologize to the fans of highlander for makeing that dreadfull moive Highlander part 2. Yes this moive does not really add too the story line of the highlander series but it dose not take away from it ethier. The director did a great job with the action and Lambert looked like he enjoyed makeing the moive. No it is not as good as the origanal moive but it does make up for the blunder that was Highlander 2.
1,end this game,"Maybe i'm just stuck on nostalgia, but there is no way this film is a proper sequal to Highlander. First of all, it is too inconsistent & pays no respect to the original film or to Connor Macleod. This films storyline is almost as pathetic as Highlander 2. There is no purpose for it & its plays out like an extended episode of the tv series. The title ""Endgame"" which suggest the end of it all, is nothing of the sort as it is obvious that there are still immortals left. The character of Duncan is play like a lost soul, & the character of Connor (the original Highlander) is butchered. This film is complete blasphemy to the original. The one star I gaveit is based in the touching scene between Duncan & Connor. It is the one decent scene in this film. There can be only one, but this is not it."
1,Not worth the money,"I missed the movie in the theater and when it was released only on DVD, I just went ahead and bought it on video. What a mistake!! Although it did bring together the original character with the series characters, I was not impressed. Actually it was awful. To have Connor admit defeat and Duncan accepts that is ridiculous. Thank goodness it was the end. I will just enjoy the first movie and forget about the botched attempts to follow that up."
4,The Further Adventures...,"Highlander: Endgame seems to pick up not long after the ending of the television series, with Duncan seeking his mentor and fellow clansman Connor, who has grown tired of the Game and gone into ""Sanctuary"" (I'll not give away any more of the plot....watch it to see what happens..).One thing though...any die-hard Highlander fan knows that Duncan was never married (see season 2, episode 4, ""The Darkness"", in which Tessa dies), yet in Endgame, his ""wife"" reappears....whats up with that?"
2,One word: ouch!....,"The effects are really where it's at in this film, and the DVD really make them shine! I missed seeing it the week it was in theaters, but this DVD transfer makes all the lightning shots look very real...the effects people must have taken quite some time to get that lightning to look so awesome! I just started listening to the commentary for insight into how this all came together.....breathtaking!....Kudos to the crew!"
2,"Bad film, but a must have for fans....","If you are not a fan, STAY AWAY! This feels more like ""The Scorpion King"" than Highlander....YUCK!But its on my shelf of DVD's, 'cause I am a fan!"
2,A Shame,"The first Highlander was such a great movie that I still find myslef drawn to anything related to it. But Even after the horrible sequel and what I think is better termed a remake with mario van pebbles this one is even a further departure from the original. The premise and mythology that made the first movie so extraordinary has been perverted to the point of making me sick. Not to mention the fact that each one of these movies seems to forget that the one before it ever happend. I liked Adrian paul but the ""we need more bad guys"" premise to make a bigger sequel just doesnt play in a movie based on single combat."
2,Ugh...,"This movie is pathetic. I consider myself a fairly big Highlander fan and I felt deeply insulted after watching this seemingly hastily-thrown together slop. I walked into the theater expecting it to be more of a guilty pleasure intended only for true Highlander fans, but I walked out just feeling dirty. The television series on which most of this ""sequel"" is based appears much better produced/directed and with a comperable budget. This is a horrible way to ""end"" the series and leaves a very poor taste in my mouth after the cancelation of the tv series and the semi-watchable Highlander: Raven series. The only reason this gets 2 stars is because it's not quite as bad as some of the earlier attempts to continue the series on the big screen. This movie might actually be more entertaining for non-Highlander fans simply because they won't be groaning throughout the entire movie watching and agonizing over what could have been."
5,Surprisingly good,"I had heard a lot of things about this movie, including hearing fellow Highlander fans panning this beyond belief. Well, I'm a devoted Highlander fan, and I must say I loved this movie a hell of a lot. True, it's nothing worthy of an Academy Award, but it's the best since the original (God only knows ""Final Dimension"" was horrible beyond belief), and the fight scenes are great (the best in the Highlander series). I hope they make more Highlander movies with Duncan, Joe, and Methos, or at least bring back the series (I really miss it, the new series ""The Raven"" sucked). All in all, I was pleased with ""Endgame"", and the extras included are pretty sweet too."
5,Engame was Outstanding!,"Say what you will ... and the legions of Connor fans will doubtless disagree with me ... but Endgame shows the *only* way that the Highlander series could possibly continue, and handles that continuance with grace and dignity. The DVD contains an alternate version of the ending (same idea, less the odd morphing), just in case you think there might be a different outcome than you saw in the theatres. I cried in the theatre, and I cry when I re-watch this marvelous addition to the Highlander canon."
2,Not necessary,"To all those who have never seen the Highlander series before, just watch the oiginal and stop there. Both sequels try to start a new saga, but the fact is that MCloud won the ""Prize"" in the first Highlander. I won't give it away, but with Mcloud winning in the first movie there never sould have been grounds for sequels. (Perhaps I just gave it away, oh well)"
2,Poor quality rewrite of the first Highlander,"If you've got the original don't bother with this one. The writers seem to have taken some elements of the first movie, thrown out most of the story and gotten weird with what they saved.I've never cared for Mario Van Peebles, his character in this show was terrible, didn't even fit in with the first story as a prequel or sequel should. Sure, there are some good moments, but if you're going to do a movie put some effort into it don't do this kind of slop."
1,Endgame - Endmovie,"Although I am a big fan of the Highlander series, this movie was aweful. There was no character development. Characters die and you could care less. I think they needed to do ALOT of rewriting - didn't - and rushed this to the screen. It was a waste of money and was a huge disappointment - I was waiting a long time for this movie to come out. I think they owed it to their fans to have created a better movie than this."
1,Highland Garbage.,"This film makes no sense, and really doesn't fit into the highlander timeline.it starts off 400 years before and Mcleod is hanging out in a cave in fuedal japan with some sorcerer Dude., how he got there is a complete mystery.then in walks the bad guys, another bunch of sorcerers and they are immortal. Well there is battle and our hero wins out and the cave collapses.. Cut to 400 years later and an archaeological team discover the cave and the sleeping immortals awaken, their clothes still in pristine condition after all the centuries, must have been sprinkled with pixie dust. The main bad guy Kane, kills the other Dudes and then teleports to New York to hunt Mcleod, oh and Kane now speaks fluent English.Usual crap then insues and mcleod saves the day.absolute crap-don't waste your money."
2,Sad rewrite of the first film...,"This movie was a disapointment.It is almost a complete rehash of the first film and Mario Van Peebles sounds and acts exactly like Clancy Brown! Even his scenes are so reminicent of the first film it made us groan when watching it in the theater.It had some interesting concepts, I think they would have been better served to have this a ""Prequel"" to the first film instead of a sequel. And they should have made a stronger attempt and crafting a different villian instead of trying to capitalize on the excellent character of the Kurgan!See the first film, watch the TV series(an alternate timeline where Conner and the Kurgan's fight was not The Gathering) Both are much better than either of these pitiful sequels. Even the Highlander TV series movie was better, it had some weak spots but it was far more interesting than this film!"
1,Not again...,"Let's face it, the first movie was the best and will never be equalled. The t.v. series was also very good, and I liked it a lot. But this movie was a waste of $6. I don't think the editing could have been any worse, totally choppy, and cut in to the continuity. As far as the acting goes, Adrian Paul looked lost, and Christopher Lambert looked to be in a great deal of pain. (And what ever happened to Paul's character ""laying down the sword"" at the end of the t.v. series?) I would love to see a t.v. movie with Adrian Paul as Highlander, but please no more theatrical releases."
4,Highlander: Endgame,I saw the movie several times in the theater and enjoyed it more each time I saw it. I am an avid fan of both the movies and the TV series and my only disappointment was that the movie was too short. The director has said the DVD will contain more scenes and additional 'making of' material. I am looking forward to buying the either the DVD (with the Director's Cut) or VHS version.
2,What is that smell????,"I'm happy that I simply rented this dvd. If you've only seen the television series, you may enjoy it, but it doesn't stack up to the best episodes there. If you're a fan of the first movie (where Connor killed the Kurgan and won the prize) and hated the following two sequels---then you'll hate this one too.Not to ruin anything, but the plot was pretty weak, the acting was sub-par (execpt for the series regulars, who were as good as usual), and the special effects were only so-so.I loved the tv series, and this movie bridges the series to the big screen, but to sacrifice some of the best characters from the original movie was a bad idea and in bad taste.This release gets 2 stars only because I made it through the entire thing before feeling completely let down.Have a nice day."
3,At least they ignored the 2nd abomination,"A good effort given the [stuff] that was touted in the second fillm. I appreciated the history with the swordmaker and all, but the idea that Connor is suddenly a master sword maker in the tradition of the old Japanese masters is a little hard to swallow. Overall a better effort than the ""original"" sequel, but not great by any means."
4,"For Connor And Duncan ""There Can Be Only One""","`Highlander - Endgame' released in '00 brings a fitting and well-constructed conclusion to the Immortals Mythos and the adventures of the cousins MacLeod. The legacy of both Connor MacLeod as played by Christopher Lambert in the three previous Highlander films and the six season television series starring Adrian Paul as Duncan MacLeod come together in grand Highlander style. You know with those two fighting side by side its got to be good! The only question that remains to be answered is ""Who's the One?""Also strong performances by Bruce Payne, legendary martial arts expert Donnie Yen and Peter Wingfield as Methos.This DVD is a must own for all Highlander fans!"
1,What the?!,"Well I waited for this movie with such high hopes only to have them dashed!This movie totally disregards all the others, did the writers just forget that Connor is the last and wins the prize or what!??Both my husband and myself were really disappointed with this movie he walked out on it!I did love seeing both McClouds togther but they distroyed it by killing Connor when any fan of the movies knows he lives well into the future(see no 2)so I was very disappointed with this movie and am left wondering why they ever made it???"
2,Depends on your mood.,"The main thing about Highlander 3 is that is looks good. The photography and camera work is good, the locations and sets/lighting are excellent. The FX are also pretty impressive although not that inventive.The best way to watch the film is to be slightly drunk and a bit tired. That way the visuals are more impressive and the story washes over you. The fact that it makes no sense with the first film and doesn't explain itself anyway won't bother you to much. I got the impression that the original script had interesting characters (Macleods son, his sons' guardian and the police man) that were cut out to concentrate more on the action and up the pace. But the result is a mess. I also think that the original script was more romantic than what ended up on the screen. Even with the messy plot, the film could have got by with more rounded characters and a slower pace with better build up to the action."
4,Highlander:Endgame lets get ready to rumble!!!,I thought that this movie was pretty good then I got the DVD version and saw the early cut of the movie and loved it. But what I don't get is what happens to Conner I mean what happens to him then what happens to the timeline of Highlander 2 I just don't get it.I like the uncut sceens to whoever reads this I sugest that you buy on DVD than on VHS.
3,okay... little bit odd... think I'll watch the original,"For starters, what's with this suddenl appearance of another immortal? I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't MacLeod alread win the Prize? This strikes me as too odd. People have said that you should watch this movie second then ""Highlander II"" and only then if you are very brave. I watched this movie, and found Van Peebles' performance quite admiral. Anyone who can go head to head with Christopher Lambert, and walk away laughing, has to be commended. Lambert needs a sense of humor. Van Peebles definetly has one. This movie is fun, but the original is better. The original had Sean Connery. This one needed Ramirez's great personality, but it still managed to save itself. Good soundtrack, though, I'll give it that!"
1,Annoying,"If you are a fan of the first movie, don't bother with this one. This is not just full of plot holes, it has plot craters. The WWII orphan Conner raises, is killed in this movie, when in the first movie we last see her as he says goodbye to her as he goes to the last fight before winning the prize. His place is destroyed, and the biggest crater of all is Conner is killed. Hold on there, he was the last one, he won the prize. The plot problems are so big the movie becomes annoying, and the total disregard for the stories that have gone before borders on insulting. This was a hack job of milking more money out of a beaten franchise."
3,there can be only one,"better than Highlander3, way better. this one has Adrian Paul and Christopher Lambert, both McClouds, teaming up to stop the evil Brucy Payne(the preist Jacob) and it tells of great storys with nice action scenes including scenes with Donnie Yen(from Blade2 and Iron Monkey). theres like one scene with sex and thats with Adrian Paul and his wife. though I hated seeing Lambert's head get chopped off but hey, thats the way it is and the ending where Paul thinks his wife is dead but shes not and she appears is a great ending."
4,"Forget Connery and Van Peebles, They Say This Is Last One!","Didn't they say that the Final Dimension was the last one? Well, anyways, this one was good, even though it was nothing relating to the original ones. Adrian something stars as the ""brother"" of Lambert, the immortal who travels across time, and together they join forces to battle the evil Kell (Bruce something). There were some scenes that were not added from the theaterical trailer but this one was a good one, but there might be another one supposidly."
1,They are the Same,"I saw Highlander, The Final Dimension for sale and I bought it. Thank goodness I didn't open the package as I noticed that one of the scenes shown on the back of the package looked just like one of the scenes on the back of Highlander III, The Sorcerer. Gee, it would have been nice if they had either kept the same title (I thought it was a whole new movie)or made some reference that it is a reediting of Highlander III, The Sorcerer. You can't even find the initial release date anywhere on the package for The Final Dimension. I give it a 1 rating, not because I don't enjoy the Highlander films, but they should make it clearer that this is not a ""new"" Highlander movie."
2,Stick with the first one,"I've only seen a few episodes of the TV series, and I've seen both sequels. I have this to say: STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL. It was fine until people tried to capitalize on its cult success and tried to make sequels. If you're not prepared for a bigtime headache, created by trying to figure out the continuity of the show and the films, then just stick with the original. It's much better."
2,OK,This movie did nothing for me. I will always be a fan of the first but not this one. Highlander 2 on the other hand. I really enjoyed Highlander 2. But for those of you who don't like it check out the Highlander 2 The Director's Cut Renagade Version. It makes more scence. then the The Quicking. Getting back to this movie. I thought it also was very violent. After Kane kills a man he likes the blood off his sword. He is a sick cookie in this movie. Stay away please it disturbed me.
3,Not bad...could have been better.,"I have to say that, after seeing this movie for the first time, I noticed it did not live up to the original Highlander..or Highlander 2(director's cut). But...I thought it was an entertaining film, especially since I'm a fan of the films and t.v. series! I think Mario Van Peebles made a great villian. C. Lambert, as always, was great. I think if they had gotten the director of the first two, it would have been a more exciting picture..since he is more familiar with the concept of Highlander."
4,Not shabby,"This movie, to me and other Highlander fans, was a relief. After Highlander 2 and the series totally detracting from the original film, this movie ignores the previous blunders and is a true sequel. This is it's major redeeming quality. The downside is that Mario Van Peeble just does an imitation of the villian from the original film, and there are a lot of loopholes in the story. Great fight scenes. A good idea that's sad because it could have been so much better."
5,Second best movie,I am a huge Highlander fan and believe that this should have been the second movie in the series. I was ecstatic to find it available on the Kindle since I have not been able to find it on DVD.
1,What Where They Thinking???,"what where they thinking when they made this movie. it completely ignores the movies, and the characters are weakly portrayed. the villian was horrible, the broad was a bad actress, and worst of all it didn't even have the music the 1st movie and the tv series did which added the great atmosphere to those. the only redeeming quality is that you get to see connor, duncan, methos, and joe again. Any of the two or three parter tv series episodes would have made better movies than this. this is just weak i expected more out of this movie. so you should rent this movie instead of making my mistake and buying it!"
3,Tough one.,"I was a HUGE fan of the original movie. It was nearly perfect. The 2nd movie was absolutely terrible. The 3rd was acceptable as it ignored all elements of the 2nd. The series was good, but just not the original.This movie tied them together with a strong leaning toward the series. I saw it in the theatre and my first impression was disappointment as a fan of the original movie. But, I would like to see it again to be sure."
1,One of the worst sequels ever....,"If there was a movie that you could give a negative rating to....this is one of them. The entire highlander francshise could have taken a different turn from the first movie - which is a cult classic and spectacularly done, but no.Hollywood has to make money of it somehow. So we end up with trash. This movie has so many logic plot holes, and passing the torch from Lambert to Paul? Terrible idea. Since Paul is not really a worthy immortal. Lambert on the other hand, played Connor Mcleod with style and panash. Paul is just....boring. Lets hope they do not do another sequel."
1,"belive me, this movie bites","i am not so much of a fan of the hihlander series, but the firts movie i realy enjoyed...and this one its so bad i had to see it in two separate times, the ""bad guy"" its awfull and it looks like its from the tv show...in fact the WHOLE MOVIE ITS LIKE A TWO HOUR SHOW!!! it has no ending and poor actors including cristofer lambert who is just to old to be and inmortal.theres only one true and good hilander movie and it was made in 86."
4,"Y Connor,y did you have to die!!!!!????NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!","...This is the only seqaul in the series that i liked.I think that this is almost as good as the first one because everything is almost the same,only flaw i see is to many flash backs.The only thing that keeps me from giving this movie 5 stars..."
2,I wanted to like this more...,"I am a Highlander fan and I liked this flick infanitely more than the other sequals, but it just didn't quite make it. The concepts are interesting and even ""cool"" and I did have some guilty pleasures, but who let those bad-guy motorcycle guys in? That, and several other lapses of sillyness just punched holes in the good points of the film. Typically, fans will like this flick better than two stars, but not love it. Non-fans should stay far away and might rate this in the turkey range. Still a helluva lot better than some tripe in theaters."
3,Would this film appeal to me if I only saw the Films ??,"I have only seen the films and wanted to have some closure, however not having seen the TV series would I be left guessing as to what has been happening in TV land. Having seen the other reviews which really didn't help I bought it anyway.Basically the answer is yes I understood it, it gives a degree of closure to the series and yet leaves enough room for a future film / series, more importantly did I enjoy it. Yes if you take the series as Highlander 1,2 (renegade version) and Endgame you would have a decent trilogy, if you realy wanted to include highlander 3 I feel you would ruin a good series.Good set of extras on this DVD, lots of trailers.yeh ! 3 stars 3.5 if I couldNot a great DVD but cerainly not a bad one certainly worth the $15"
2,"Not so High, lander...","I remember seeing the trailer for this film, absolutely certain that it couldn't be much worse than the second sequel.Isn't it just like Hollywood to surprise at will?Not only was it worse than ""The Quickening"", it insulted most die-hard fans by the blatant re-scripting of the first film, and the uninspired casting of Mario Van Peeples as the main villain. There's a difference between over-the-top and conducting a seminar on hammy acting, and his performance fits the latter in this case.The high points, if any, are the ... uh... naughty scenes involving the incredibly beautiful Deboragh Kara Unger, but the rest of the film is a bore. You'd do better to skip this and check out ""Highlander:Endgame"" if you're in need of a Highlander fix."
3,A thoroughly average movie,"This movie is a marked improvement over the second movie in this series, but overall it was simply average.The plot followed nothing in the original movie or the TV series.If you are a die hard highlander fan then you will want to watch this movie, otherwise spend your money elsewhere."
3,good movie,I loved the first highlander movie i hated the second and id have to say i liked this one.It starts of where connor goes after his wife dies he leaves scotland to japan.and the bad guy kills the the soccererer gets traped in a mountain goes back to present day bad guy escapes kills one his henchmen goes after conner.At the of the movie when he fights the bad guy youd swear it was a rock video.I liked it so watch it.
2,A True Disappointment,"Being a tremendous fan of the first Highlander film (especially as a Queen worshipper and follower of Sean Connery)The sequals have all been a disappointment, this one in particular. I was hoping that this film could sort out the timelines throughout the series, but no, they have caused even more confusion - where on earth do the Canopy and the explanation about Aliens from Outer Space ideas fit in - and at that time where was Duncan?. Did they shoot the Continuity Director at the end of the first film? Haven't the writers and production teams seen the previous movies? If you don't try to connect this film with any of the others then it may have deservered 3 stars, but from someone who likes to make sense of a story, it was lucky to get 2."
2,"Wretched Remake, but better than Highlander II","This movie was horrible. I got the impression that they wanted to apologize for Highlander II, but making a worse version of Highlander I is not the way to do it. Many inconsistencies, poor acting, avoid at all costs unless you're a Highlander completist."
1,Not as good as one would think,"I didnt feel this movie was good at all, in fact i felt it was a huge dissapointment. I reccomend even if you are a highlander fan rent it first. See it for yourself, then decide on it. I disliked this highlander the most. the first was great and the rest seemed to go downhill. This one was wrock bottom. But dont take my word for it, rent it and see for yourself"
3,"What happened to ""there can be only one""?","This can only be an attempt to unseat Connor as the best immortal. Can Duncan fill his shoes? This can only be seen down the road. The biggest mystery that should leave anyone viewing this Highlander episode is; do we see a new type of immortal emerging? Faith/Kate, Duncan's long lost wife, loses her head to Jacob Kell. She emerges later intact? Has someone lost their train of thought on this? Would Widen approve of this? Other than this point the movie is pretty good in the Highlander sense."
3,A Good Movie With Problems,"Highlander Endgame was great. The acting was good, effects excellent, and it is very entertaining. The only flaw is the storyline. The storyline doesn't follow the original plot, and is somewhat hard to learn. In the first highlander we learned there could only be 1 immortal left to win the prize. 2 and 3 both explained a way for there to be more immortals. This one didn't. The plot didn't follow the original story, and it was a little hard to follow at sometimes. The movie is great, and I recommend it to everyone if your a highlander fan."
3,More Good Than Bad - 3 and 1/2 stars,"This is the 4th Highlander movie and the best one, next to the first one.It stars Christopher Lambert (Conor MacCloud from the first movie) and Adrian Paul (Duncan MacCloud from the TV show) who get together to chop up a real bad dude named Kell and his cronies. What makes a good Highlander story? A good plot? Yes, this one has a good plot, Kell is a villian from long ago (they're immortals, remember?) who shows up to mess with Duncan's ex-wife and Conor's head. What about the swordfighting? Ahhh, there we have a problem. There simply was'nt enough for me; the scene in New York was good but there was a little too much ""Boo-hoo, I'm an 400 year old immortal and I'm so lonely"" type stuff going on in the film (reminds me of Crouching T.H.D.). Sheesh! But don't despair, there is some good swordplay and head-chopping towards the end. Don't get me wrong, this film is waaaaaaaaaaaay better than Highlander 2 & 3."
2,Highlander Endgames,Being a faithful Highlander viewer i felt that this movie had no relavence to previous Highlander films. Being that Connor MacLeod is the one that recieves the prize in all previous movies i found it ludacress that in Endgames he would die at the hands of Duncan Macleod an immortal with less experience.
1,This Movie Is Torture.,This is one of the worst movies ever.It is completely awful.There is not one good thing about it.Avoid this movie like the plague because it is completely awful.Stay away from this garbage.Peace Out.
1,Why was this garbage ever made,"I just watched this load of Ass, and neither enjoyed or disliked this movie.My question is why was this film ever made, lets be honest the tv series really was a different entity to the film series. What this almagam of crap is, is neither one thing or the other and makes no sense whatsover. Adrian Paul was good in the TV series, but this Dude ain't Lambert. lambert was always the Highlander, and the tv show just a distraction in between movies.One word in a nutshell ""crap"" give this movie amiss, if you like the Highlander."
1,"Umm, where does this fit in the timeline?","If you haven't seen any of the other Highlander movies, then you will like this one. It's not a bad movie really. It just doesn't fit in with the established timeline for the Highlander story. We know, from the first movie, that Conner wins the prize. However in the world his death at the hands of Duncan fits into THAT, I have yet to figure out. My friends and I were sorely disappointed with this one."
1,Pure garbage and lies upon lies,"This is my first review of anything. I found this movie to be an honest piece of garbage. Conner MacLeod appears to be totally different from the original movie. He is aloof, shadowy and distant. He won the prize. How the heck are they still fighting Immortals. Why couldn't the dummies who wrote this film had some sort of continuity with the 1st film?They could have made a movie by placing it between events in the first film. Any true fans of these films must agree with me. I am not one to nitpick on minutiae (spelling??) but this is pure nonsense. Duncan kills Conner?!, c'mon what kind of bullcrap is that. I'm going to try to send this back and get my money back. Why didn't a review explain this blatant contradiction?"
1,There is no pit deep enough ...,"... where to drop this. Unbelievably bad sequel of a cult movie. It only compares favorably to Highlander 2, but the special effects are not as good..."
2,Another Horrible Sequel,"Do yourself a tremendous favor. Watch the first Highlander movie and forget that sequels even exist. Although this one isn't anywhere near as pathetic as Highlander 2, it's still pretty bad. Connor was the last immortal left at the end of the first movie. He won the prize and was one with all living things. Therefore it is completely and utterly ridiculous that there could have been any other immortals left on Earth. The movie also has no originality to it at all. It is pretty much just a remake of the first Highlander. So like I said, just watch Highlander 1 and stop there. Trust me. You won't be missing anything."
4,BETTER WITH EACH VIEWING,"When I first watched ""Highlander: The Final Dimension"" a few years ago, I was disappointed. But after watching the film a couple of more times, I started to warm up to it more. True, its still the worst film in the series, but it is still a pretty good movie. The story is a bit weak due to the fact that the writers pretty much rehashed the plot for the first film. Still, the acting is great, and the battle scenes are pretty dang good. While non-fans will find little to enjoy in the film, established fans will be pleased for the most part.Movie/DVD Grade: B"
1,"whimpy,whimpy,whimmmmmmpy!",where did they find this schmoe lambert?why did they settle on him?how did this become a franchise?the best thing about this is that it must end sometime!
1,No constancy in the movies,"1st movie Connor Macleoud becomes the last immortal 2nd movie really pushes the story line, but if you ignore little details it follows 3rd follows the original polt this movie Connor Macleoud gets killed by another immortal which goes beyond the whole consistencies of the movieI know the time line and the tv show has problem with timelines but the general storylines still follows.Also the great special affects in the commercials are not in the movie"
5,INTERESTING,"I liked this movie because the settings and locations kept changing quickly and introduced new characters thru-out. One minute they're in old France, then old Scotland then present day Egypt etc. Lambert is cool too and Van Peebles hams it up nicely a the bad guy. It's a cool movie. Trust me."
3,"Good story, but the end doesn't make much justice","Yes, this one it's a very mixed bag. It have some elements from the movie franchise plus the elements from the TV serie with Adrian Paul. The end of this Ending Game is not my favorite thou, because I like more Connor than Duncan. Well, not exactly for that. I just thought it wasn't time for Lambert to leave the franchise. Not that way.Anyway, it is a very nice story about hope and faith. It also have Jim Byrnes as Joe Dawson, the watcher. The final battle is great, but the end makes you watch all other old Highlander movies again.Now they will again give a new direction to the story of the immortals with the new movie, The Source, the first part of a trilogy. It will have Duncan, Methos and Dawson on the script. Let's hope that the end of Connor at least have left a legacy. I wish them luck to bring us another great and epic story."
2,Actually not a sequel,"The first problem is that the first highlander could not have sequels. All you who have seen the first one know this. I dont say that the first one is better, but it is.You do get to see some flashbacks from the first one in the beginning, but thats just to show us that this one is supposed to be a sequel. Not that it is, as i said. All the other immortals were dead, but now suddely macleod finds more of them...how? no explanation.How about the movie as it is..... Well the evil one is played by Mario Van Peebles, which does a good job, and the good guy as alaways, Christopher Lambert, who is also good. The fight scenes should be more brutal and much faster. why do they draw out everything? The swordplay scenes should be short, fast and well choregraphed instead of being outdrawn and quite boring. But thats just my opinion.The main highlight is that the sex scene is the best of all the higlander movies.Rent it before you buy it!"
2,I shan't waste too much of your time,"I read another review describing ""Endgame"" as a ""complete waste of potential."" That pretty well hits the nail on the head. The screenplay is badly written, and acting is all right in some places, sub-par in others. I was so disappointed, I threw the film away after one viewing."
5,Nice and Solid,"This DVD epitomizes the best of the best from the Highlander series. There were a few cheesy moments and a touch of overacting here and there, but over all it was a solid hit. If the story were to stop here this would be a good way to wrap it all up."
3,"""There can be only one"".","""There can be only one!""Is the catch phrase for ""Highlander"" saga. The original movie seemed to have concluded the story. When the producers realized maybe they were hasty in concluding the story they decided to breath life into twogod-awful sequels then developed the series. At first I was resistantto the series however, after catching a couple of episodes my interest waschanged from curiousity to be the thrid season to ardent fan. However,I felt that Connor Macleod was always the ""true Highlander"" but you cannotignore the market. While attending a ""Clan convention"" in 1997 I was trhe only attendee to wear something to do with Conor Macleod. Endgame had some good points and some not so good points.Had they released the ""Director's Edition"" in the thearters the movie would have done a better box office."
5,A thorough and readable analysis of the British media,"This book contains a thorough insight into the history of the British press and broadcasting. It's historical review examines the interplay between successive British Governments and the emergence of a free press and broadcasting. It goes on to assess the consequences for the 'new' media in Britain; satellite and cable. Key themes include the BBC, as the world's first 'public service broadcaster' - a unique institution which has suffered many trials at the hands of the Government, in particular, during the '80s administration of Margerat Thatcher. I achieved a degree under the tutoring of the book's co-author Jean Seaton and am now successfully employed at the BBC. A fantastic, level headed critique which renders an enormous topic palatable."
1,Spring Waltz,I never received this movie - not available since sold out. Would like to purchase if another copy is available.
2,"Beautiful, but not recommendable","This drama is so beautiful, and I enjoyed it when it was broadcasted in Japan.However, I later knew that the version which had been broadcasted in Japan was ""director's cut"" edition, and that each episode only lasts for around 50 minutes.In original ""uncut"" version, each episode lasts from 50 upto 68 minutes, and I think this is a big difference. I once had a chance to see ""uncut"" version, and I enjoyed it very much!I bought this DVD because I thought this was ""uncut"" edition (there were 20 episodes, and here, it says ""Run Time: 1200 minutes""), but when I saw this, I noticed that this was almost the same as ""director's cut"" edition, broadcasted in Japan. I think I made a big mistake!If you want to enjoy ""uncut"" version, I would recommend you to buy Korean edition with English subtitle (there are ""special features"", but no English subtitle ).Sorry for my poor English!"
3,Spring Waltz,"After viewing a few episodes online, I decided to purchase this mini-series. Even not knowing the language, I could tell there were many edited scenes from the original series. The story is good. The actors/actresses are good but in my opinion the editing was much to be desired. Still a good story but more of the original should have been left in for all to see."
3,Spring Waltz,"This is the first Korean dvd I own. I am so thrilled because my husband ends up watching it with me. It is quite dragging on the first part of the story when they did a flashback when they were young, but its for the better understanding of how the story goes. The director is very good, the casting, the music, the scenes, and the story line is perfect. If you love drama, I recommend this one."
3,Good natured family film,"This is one of those movies that left me feeling happy. Call me corny, but in this day-and-age it's hard to find a movie that the entire family can watch and enjoy. I loved the nostalgia of the 50's and imagining Waikiki as it once was. The movie portrayed a time in life when families and friends were loyal and committed to one another, even when their lives weren't perfect. I would recommend this movie to families with kids in their early to mid-teens, not to soul searching, Adrenalin junkies looking for the perfect wave."
2,Pointless.,"This movie is a waste of time. I bought it (for too much money) over E-Bay because it was compared to Endless Summer. None of the feeling and emotion from Endless Summer was apparent. The writing was particularly bad. Like Maltin says: bland, (I might add corny and formulaic) and I blame it on the script. Don't even bother to pursue this movie for purchase. It has no real point. Although the cinematography is good, this movie is pointless."
4,Hard Popcorn Science Fiction,"Swanwick combines hard science fiction speculation about the future of the moon with a fastpaced action-adventure story that wouldn't be out of place in Hollywood. This is a short novel, orginally published in Asimov's Science Fiction as a novella, and it well worth reading in one sitting. So what are you waiting for? Pop some popcorn and start reading."
2,Swanwick's done better.,"The protagonist is a loner on the Moon who wants nothing more than to be left alone to commune with virgin territory, but circumstances throw him into proximity with others as well as wake him up to responsibility. This is a grand theme in the old SF tradition--in fact, except for the explicit sex and the up-to-date science references (specifically, nanotech), this is something that wouldn't have been out of place in 50s SF. This is a short book, technically a novella, that oftentimes seems rushed. The pacing was kind of a jump-up and wait proposition, very irregular feeling. Michael Swanwick has done much better than this in both characters and plot.(This ""review"" originally appeared in First Impressions Installment One [http://www.owt.com/users/gcox/fi.contents.html].)"
4,Some companies may want to move in this direction,"Increasingly, it appears that for many of us and our companies, our core competence focuses around knowing certain things and being able to use this knowledge better than others. Especially with all the publicity about outsourcing and offshoring to developing countries that have many smart, educated people willing to perform skilled tasks at much lower wages.The authors are therefore correct in asserting that many companies are fundamentally knowledge-based, or at least they should be. It is for the latter companies that the book may prove more useful. That is, you think your company should move in this direction, but, for whatever reason, that has not successfully happened. In this case, you may want to at least consider this book. It can be applied to a company in any field. There is no restriction to an Information Technology context."
4,A Pensive Tonic,"Though not as aggressive as ""Sugar"" this recording nonetheless offers up a quality effort featuring more than a few dynamite tracks (what this fan has come to expect). If you like Tonic you'll love this one - a few licks into ""Roses"" and you're hooked again. Whether called taking a breather or steadying a perspective, I'm glad the guys feel they have their ""Head on Straight"" and look forward to their next. Tonic rocks!"
1,Unsatisfied Customer,"I was dissapointed with my transaction from this seller. I never received my product. I have made several attempts to contact the seller, and have yet to receive a response. I hope this matter can be clarified soon."
2,Disappointing . . .,"I'm surprised by all the glowing reviews. I loved the previous two CDs -- in fact ""Sugar"" is maybe my favorite CD EVER. This is not in the same league with Sugar and Lemon Parade. I find the songs to be whiny and silly. The lyrics don't really make sense -- and since when does Def Leppard sing back-up for Tonic? The backing vocals are the overproduced, lush, Mutt Lange type vocals. Yuck! How many times do I have to listen to Emerson Hart begging his honey not to leave him? ""I'm keeping my head on straight"", ""I don't want to be alone again"", blah, blah, blah. I don't think this CD will do as well as the previous two. But I'll wait patiently for the next one. When Tonic is good -- they're the best there is."
5,"Tonic rocks on with ""Head on Straight""","This CD, from beginning to end, is downright spectacular. The lead singer (Emerson Hart) has a great voice and fits the sound of the band perfect. Tonic has so much talent that isn't recognized and it makes me somewhat angry. I really can't choose a favorite song on this album because every song holds 5 stars in my book. I suggest you buy this album. You will NOT be disappointed."
5,Can't get it out of my head...,"I have been a fan of Tonic's for years now, and have had the great pleasure of seeing these guys play live at least a dozen times. Hands down, one of the best live acts around and hands down, one of the most under-appreciated bands out there today. Emerson's voice is simply awesome, and both Dan and Jeff blend in their amazing talent in this album (as well as the other two). I definitely think HOS is my favorite of the three (and believe me, it was a tough choice), but I absolutely cannot get songs like Do You Know? and Let Me Go out of my head. And I love Roses and Liar---classic rock songs. I promise you'll listen to it over and over and over---and never get tired of it. Buy the album and then go see them live! You won't regret it."
2,Read David Waldo's Review - He's Right!,"David Waldo's review of 2-23 said it best. There's not much more to add. However, to the 18 year old who's enamored of the lovesick lyrics on this CD -- yes, you're right -- most of the CD appears to be about Emerson Hart's screwed up love life. There are several problems with this: (1) I don't really want to pay money to hear a guy beg his wife to take him back for an hour, and (2) in between the begging and whining, the lyrics don't make much sense. When I hear the lyrics, ""Give me love/Give me fascination/Give me strength that I can save my relationship"", I actually cringe. I love Tonic. I'm proud that they were nominated for Grammy's. But for the life of me, I cannot figure out why it was for this CD. It's alright. I listen to it sometimes, but it's not their best work. Buy Lemon Parade or Sugar instead."
3,Flashpoint by George La Fountaine,"They found $850,000 in abandoned cash. It was their ticket to luxury -- and terror....It began as a stroke of incredible luck for Robert Logan and Ernie Wheeler, border patrol cops. Partners and pals who enjoyed whiskey and women, they suddenly discovered $850,000 in cash buried in the sand in an abandoned jeep -- next to a skeleton.It should have been their ticket to a first-class life -- if they didn;t land up like the thing in the jeep.What was in store for them was something much more terrifying.FLASHPOINTA chilling drama of intrigue, murder, and brutal suspense."
5,Clean and Funny,Hilarious. My husband and I were able to enjoy good comedy with the kids in the same room and not have to worry about needing a mute button.
4,Pinchers Hot Leroy not!,"Pinchers is one of my favorite singers therefore I had to make this a part of my collection, but that leroy guy isn't that great. He's a good singer but the beats are too fast for his stlye of singing unlike pinchers who can rock a fast beat just as good as a slow one. peace & unity"
4,"Well, The Mastering Is Good","The idea of Universal's Millennium Collection to highlight various artists catalogs has been going on for a few years now, I thought Richard was going to skip an entry to this series. Um, I was wrong. Instead of looking at this project as a blank canvas, featuring an exclusive remix available only on this collection, or maybe an outtake of some kind, we are treated to another collection of previously remixed singles already available on domestically released collections. It's a good highlight or introduction to the Carpenters body of work but if you're a completist, take comfort in knowing you're not missing a thing."
2,Rather Disappointing,"This is a nice book for those who will not read the Nikon user's guide. There is nothing technical here that is not in the user's manual, and no special tips or tricks. Any general photographic advice can often be found in better, free tutorials on the Internet. (e.g. see Luminous Landscape) A much better guide is Mastering Nikon Digital Cameras, an e-book (CD) by Peter iNova. His e-book should be recommended accessory #1. I bought the Short Course based upon advice from Steve's Digicams, and was disappointed in his recommendation. I looked at Short Course once, and put it away, to sell whenever I sell my CP 990. I have referred to iNova's book repeatedly, and keep finding new tips, from which I derive new thoughts and ideas."
2,"""Home made manual"" with the price tag of a Hardcover book!","It is fine for the novice trying to understand general photography, but if you are new to digital photography this ""manual"" makes it hard to understand the Nikon Coolpix 990.I was not impressed with this ""manual"" The owners manual is much better for explaining, through photos & diagrams, (which this ""manual"" has few of for the camera) the workings of this digital camera. NO index makes it very inconvenient. Stick with the owners manual till a better book on this camera comes out."
2,"Generic text, Not specific to the Coolpix 990- Don't Bother!","My first impression lasted with me - cheap black and white pages and not many quality pictures. For the pictures that were in the book, they could not have been taken with the Coolpix, because the quality was not great. The spiral binding was cheap and you could not flip the pages without fooling with the binding.As far as content, the book was good for general and generic photography tips. A beginner would learn from this book, although there are much better general photogarphy books (in color too) for the same price. References were made to the Coolpix, but no more than you would get than from reading the owners manual. They could very easily be talking about any other camera. You are much better to read the owners manual and not buy this book.Pass on this book. Certainly not worth the price. I will be returning it today."
2,There are Better Alternatives,"Does not compare with Mastering Nikon Compact Digital Cameras (CP950/990), an e-book (on CD-Rom) authored by Peter iNova. That e-book has high resolution photos, full coverage of the Nikon Coolpix Cameras, explanations of digital photgraphy,and many tips, tricks, and digital darkroom aids which are all lacking in the Curtin book. INova's digitalsecrets.net also provides full support for the e-book something you don't get with the really ""short course"" by Curtin!!"
4,"Good value, well worth buying...",I learned more about my CoolPix 990 in a few hours by reading this book than in the past 2 weeks of pouring over Nikon's Guide to Digital Photograpgy that came with the camera. The book is a great value and well worth the price and the time you invest in reading it.
4,"Graphic Pictorial, Just missing the smell of Gun powder!","Excellent book! The photography speaks a thousand words to make up for lack of text! This book is not meant to be a blow-by-blow historical account of the war; there are other titles that cover that in detail. This is also an excellent book for uniform collectors to reference, or anybody wanting to visually comprehend the war in Angola."
5,GREAT DRAMA - MUST WATCH,"I normally don't watch historical dramas. However, I was actually on vacation in Korea for several weeks and got swept into watching this drama. Despite what the other reviewer writes, I can't emphasize enough that this is a DRAMATIZATION of history. No matter what your ethnicity, it's a fun DRAMA. I've watched over 75 Korean drama mini-series and have recommended only a small handful. Most are predictable with similar plots (love triangle; deadly disease with a miraculous happy ending; tragic). This drama is worth watching. However, even if your semi-fluent like me, you're gonna need subtitles to watch this drama due to the use of old-fashion Korean."
1,Fell apart immediately,"My son loves Spiderman and this costume looked great. When we got it we were all excited about how it looked and fit, but within 24 hours of receiving it, it literally began falling apart at the seams. It's made of a nylon material and there are several spots where major runs are happening. There are two sizeable holes at the waist and the shoulder seams are coming apart as well. I am very, VERY disappointed at the shoddy workmanship, and am NOT looking forward to taking it away from my son. But I am not going to spend money on a product that can't even last one day, so I am going to try and return it. PLEASE, do not waste your money if your child wants to wear this costume for more than a few hours on Halloween."
4,great lil costume!,The costume is great! My little boy loves it and won't take it off! It was really well priced and shipped promptly!
1,Fell apart within two weeks of purchase,"...maybe we just got a defective product. I don't know. But future buyers should be aware. Within two weeks, we have a hole around the waist big enough to put your hand through, and the material around the neck and Velcro closure at the back is just falling apart.Also, FYI, it doesn't come with the feet shown in the picture."
4,Great Costume,"My son LOVES this costume. I'd be worried about the mask for trick or treating, but for dress up at home it's great. He's a small 4 1/2 (30-50% on growth chart) and it fits him well (size 4/6) with probably an inch of length in the legs and arms for growth. The chest muscles are great. My son feels tough, but they are nice and soft vs some of the hard plastic costumes we've had. This wouldn't be good for a chunk kid-it's a little slim. The CONS....The velcro is bound to cause a lot of snags. I wish manufacturers would put flaps in to cover the velcro when they take it off."
5,Two thumbs up!,"So happy with this purchase! My 3 year old son has been wearing it around the house non-stop since getting it and it's still in good shape. I'm glad I listened to the reviews and went with a size bigger than what he normally wears, bc it definitely does run small. It looks exactly like the pic in person."
3,one day wear,Very cute for costume parties or Halloween but the problem is my 4 year old loves to play dress up. After 2 daya of him wearing it the costume was falling apart. The stitching came loose and the whole costume looked like trash. Sorry but not worth the $30 in my opinion for two days of use.
3,Product,The costume material is not that great. It fell apart within days. Have had to sew it more than a few time. But my son still loves it and plays with it all the time.
4,My son loves this!,I bought this for my son to wear around the house during play time. He wore the darn thing out! The mask didn't last long and eventually began to unravel and fall apart. The body lasted longer but began to do the same around the top of the arms. He loves spiderman so it was prefect for him!
3,cost was too much,"The outfit is made of poor quality material. Around the neck it ripped very fast and I was required to pretty much stitch it with a needle and thread in hopes it would stop fraying and tearing. It worked, but I would look elsewhere for a spider man costume."
2,Waste of Money!,"Please save your money. It's a cute item, but it's made so incredibly cheaply. From the moment we removed it from the packaging the seams began to unravel. The material is so thin that there's hardly anything to grip with a needle, so I'm not able to fix the problem myself long-term. The back only attaches by velcro and is perpetually coming undone. Our six-year-old son loved it at first but quickly grew tired of it coming unfastened and falling off his shoulders. Big disappointment."
3,Spiderman Costume,"My son loves the costume. You can purchase the exact costume from Walmart for $19 even. My son is age 5 and average sized. I read the previous reviews and purchased a size 7/8. I'm glad I did. I fits perfect. I love the costume. Just beware, that it runs small, also look at Walmart if you feel comfortable purchasing from that store. You can save a few bucks."
1,Deluxe Kids Costume,The zipper broke off within the first hour. The mask was way too small and the back of the costume started come apart at the rear seam by the end of the night (after only 2 hours). It would be a great costume if it was better quality.
2,¿Aprender a volar?,"Con este libro se trata de llegar a cierta profundidad y reflexión, aunque en realidad se hubiera podido llegar más lejos no fue así, debido a la carencia de argumentos para constituir en sí buenos consejos. Puede ser objeto de lectura durante un viaje aburrido o algo por el estilo.Cynthia Alvarez"
1,Well.,"I think that I was happy when it had came in, but it also had a good number of scratches on it which upset my boyfriend, whom I had got it for."
5,wonderful love story,"This is the second in Tess Mallory's Highlander time-travel trilogy. This story rates right up there with the best of the best.A shy, modern-day woman, Cheslsea Brown, is thrown into the 1800 wild West with Scottish clan leader, Griffin Campbell,to save Griffin's cousin from being hung for murder. Chelsea has to figure out a way to rescue all three of them and return them to present times."
2,Couldn't get past the vomiting,"Ordinarily I love time travel Scottish highlander romances. Sorry, but I found this book somewhat laughable and not sexy or romantic in the least bit. A hero who throws up everytime he kisses the girl he loves? Aside from the convoluted plot of jumping around from place to place, the heroine was so tiresome with her inferiority complex and jealousy of her friends. I won't be reading another by this author."
3,Serviceable Towel warmer,"I bought this towel warmer after about a year of contemplating whether this would fit in my small bathroom. Amazon was running a terrific sale so for the price, under $100, it is hard to beat. Installation was fairly easy (I have mine plugged in). Most important, it does warm my towels. Although it's not a hot as I expected it to be. The satin nickel finish is cheap looking and the adhesive used for the stickers on the rails removed part of the finish when I took them off. Overall for the price I am happy with my purchase."
1,cheap knockoff of original Warmrails,"I've had this experience before - a quality US brand gets taken over by a Chinese maker, they cost reduce it and turn it into an inferior product. The picture is of the US made Warmrails - that is NOT what you will get - no welded seams, painted NOT satin nickel. The rails were loose on the one I received. It says ""UL"" on it but I doubt the new model was really approved from what I know about UL requirements.DON'T TRUST ANY REVIEW WRITTEN BEFORE 2009 - IT WAS A DIFFERENT PRODUCT!They do get warm and do the job, and the price is lower than most of the other brands. CAVEAT EMPTOR."
5,It's perfect for a small bathroom space.,"We bought the Warmrails Hardwire/Softwire Towel warmer a few weeks ago, installed it ourselves and we really like it. We actually had an ulterior motive for buying the towel warmer: We wanted a safe, ongoing heat source in a small bathroom to help keep the moisture content down in a room that typically stays damper than we'd like. So, on that note, the Towel Warmer is successful. Having the towel warmer going 24/7 is keeping the small bathroom space dryer overall with no extra moisture clinging to the windows and ceiling. The towel warmer fits well on a small wall space, AND, we are enjoying warm towels when we get out of the shower. This one works perfectly for us. We'd recommend it to others. Thanks."
2,Not Warm Enough!,"This towel warmer looks great but barely gets warm at all. Although several reviewers indicated it did not get very warm, I thought perhaps they expected it to get super hot. Having owned a couple of towel warmers in the past I wasn't expecting it to be burning hot, but I did expect it would heat the towels through so that you could at least notice they had been on a towel warmer. I leave it on 24/7 and can barely feel any warmth in my towels. You can keep your hand on the bars without any discomfort--it does not produce sufficient warmth to do the job properly. Warmrails really needs to address this problem. I would return it but it is already installed and too much trouble to remove and return. Oh, it does hold 2 towels easily."
2,Disappointed,This was a Christmas present for my husband and I'm sad to say it was a disappointment. We can not return it but would have returned it if we could. When left on for over 24 hours the towels are barely warm not hot. It also does not warm the room as stated in the description.
3,It is not perfectly rectangular.,The shape should be perfect. It works well so far.It seems to be expensive to put in if hard wired.
3,Not worth the price,"After using towel warmers many times while in Europe we decided to buy one for our master bathroom. It looks nice, and we hard-wired it, but it really doesn't do the trick. The towels are slightly warmer than they would have been, but for the money (we paid $120) and the electricity it uses, we would have expected to grab nice, warm towels off the rack in the winter. We don't usually have to worry about towels getting dry on a normal rack, so that wasn't an issue. Now that it is installed it will have to stay, but I wish I'd saved the money and the holes in the bathroom wall."
3,Warmrails Hardwire option review,The cover plate over the wall elecrical box is not designed to mount on recessed wall box. It does not cover the the wall opening for the electrical box leaving unsifghtly appearance. Poor design choice.
3,It's OKh,"Price is OK, does not dry towel as well since it just Bars and not metal panels. The dry area is smaller, but it does the job with one towel at the time."
3,Prefer larger model,I purchased the smaller Regent model due to size constraints. It does the job of drying and warming but only for one bath size towel. If you have the room I would suggest the larger Kensington model.
1,Doesn't keep towel as warm as expected,"We are not thrilled with it. First, it does not keep the towel warm even if it was left overnight with heating turned on. We have installed it on a wall by the door in place of an oridinary towel bar. The towel warmer protrudes so much, the door does not open completely. We are not happy about that either."
3,Not what one might hope,"I ordered 2 in after a fair amount of research and review verification. As described by some, they look a little cheap (one is a little different-shaped and more twisted than the other) and have a sticky name tag--but they work, with the caveat you have to spend an extra $30 for a separate timer which must be separately grounded (more $ for installation) for bathroom use. Also, one of mine came broken--the top bar bar rotates endlessly and clunks when a towel is placed upon it. I can not return it because Amazon is out of stock. If I could, I would still get another--although I would vet it better--because you get what you pay for and I don't want to shell out $600+ for better-made models."
2,inadequate towel warmer,this item neither dried nor warmed our towels after being on for 24 hours. we were greatly disappointed and returned it.
4,gloomy but informative,"This book has no table of contents, no index and no pictures but just newspaper reports from 1880 to 1961 on various lynching incidents. The headlines are all in bold type and the complete articles are given. The articles are not an easy read for the squeamish. All of the gory details of the lynchings are given including why the victim was lynched, how the victim was tortured before the lynching and the method used for execution.Here are some examples of a few headlines to give you an idea of the content:""First Negro at West Point Knifed by Fellow Cadets"" ""Texans Lynch Wrong Negro"" ""Lynched for Being Black"" ""Wrong Man Lynched as Rapist"" ""Negro Youth Mutilated for Kissing White Girl"" ""Negro Shot Dead for Kissing his White Girlfriend"" The redeeming value in a book like this is that it's a study of human behavior. It shows how far people can and will go in the name of hate and what kinds of things people are capable of."
4,You Must Read This Book,100 Years of Lynchings obviously won't make you feel good but it an absolutely necessary book to have in your collection if you are serious student of American history.
4,TRUE HISTORY,"I AM FROM THE SOUTH AND WAS TOLD HOW THINGS WERE DOWN THERE AS A KID, SOYOU HAD TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE WAY YOU ACTED, LOOKED OR SPOKE AROUND WHITE PEOPLE AT THAT TIME. THIS BOOK SHOWED THE REALITY OF WHITE PEOPLES CRUELTY AGANST THE EX-SLAVE,[BLACK MAN]WHO WAS NOT EVEN CONSIDERED A HUMAN BEING.SO WITH PICTURES AND POST CARD OF THE DEEDS.WHY ARE WE PRETENDING TOWORRY ABOUT WATER-BOARDING A TERRORIST WHEN WE USE GO TO SEE ABLACK MAN BARBECUED AT THE STAKE LIKE A CIRCUS ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON. OH YES,IT WASN'T ONLY IN THE SOUTH,BUT ALL OVER THE USA THE BOOK SHOWS THAT TOO! GOOD BOOK!TRUE HISTORY."
4,respectable horror novel,"I thought this was fairly good, it had some funny parts and chilly horror bits as well. I liked the plot, about a paparazzi photographer who accidently takes a demon's picture at a funeral. Somewhat cheesy but fun horror story."
3,Not quite Koontz,"I picked this book because it was suggested for fans of Dean Koontz. Not quite. It was an okay read, but I won't look for this author again. If you appreciate British style, or an anti-hero, you might like it more than I did."
5,Phantasmagorical thriller,"I loved this book. The main protagonist may be a sleazy papparazo who will do anything to get the picture but that makes him all the more believable in this intriguing, phantasmagorical thriller. Joe Creed finds himself the unwitting participant in a game of cat and mouse with the forces of darkness which puts his soul and sanity to the test. This is most definitely now one of my favourite novels by a true master of horror."
4,A little of over the top,"to be convincing as a horror novel, therefore it can be comedic at times even if this was sometimes unintentional by the author. On top of this there is not a single likable character in the book. The hero is really an anti-hero. Yet even though the book is far from a masterpiece I still enjoyed it. This is the 3rd James Herbert Book I've read. I loved ""The Magic Cottage"". However, I did not enjoy ""'48"" much. Creed rates somewhere in between the two."
4,"Cliche today, but still exciting","The subject of this book (steal two atomic bombs and hold the world hostage) would be considered cliche these days, but only because this was the first book to use that formula.Fleming wrote a pretty good one here, but it seemed to end in a hurry. You really don't get to know what happened with the SPECTRE operatives in full detail. The character of Domino was only seen briefly, and you don't get to see her tortured by Largo (thank God, though) but she's described well enough to be a ""real"" person. The beginning was a little slow. On the whole I'm really glad these novels aren't too long, they're exactly the length they need to be.And those two points are the only complaints I have...it was otherwise a great book, certainly a classic James Bond, with enough excitement and detail to make it real. And I like the sexy covers on the new editions :)"
4,Super Reader,"M has received Bond's medical report. Basically it says two packs a day smoking ain't good. He sends him to a health farm to get himself back together. He comes across a man from a Macao tong, who is also working for Blofeld, head of SPECTRE. A confrontation between the two is violent, and Bond is helped out by a nurse. He gets some of his own back.Bond ends up in the Bahamas, and working with Leiter again, now back in the CIA. Emilio Largo is working there with his bombshell woman, Domino, and he is Blofeld's top man.SPECTRE had hired Domino's brother to nick a couple of warheads, having access as a military officer to at transport flight. Then they offed him.When Bond tells Domino this information, he turns her and uses her to his advantage. The book ends with a confrontation between Bond and babe vs Largo, and an American submarine vs Largo's crew."
4,James Bond saves the world from nuclear disaster,"Secret Agent 007 first encounters SPECTRE in this exciting tropical adventure. This spy novel reads like a mystery as Bond gradually puts together the pieces of SPECTRE's plot to hold the world hostage. As always, the tale takes place in exotic locations and is filled with beautiful women and thrilling action. Fleming includes another tension-filled casino showdown, too. In addition, the titles in the James Bond Classic Library are inexpensive but very nice-looking hardcover volumes"
3,Another solid offering...though been retreaded by earlier work,"Fleming presents a solid novel here that again is entertaining and recommended to all, though you will see similiarities with previous offerings and may seem that he was getting a 2nd wind."
5,Good jokes,I wish I could tell jokes like Jackie -- without his annoying laugh. There are a few jokes on the disc that alone are worth the price of the disc. I'd pay serious bucks to go to his show but he's never going to play here. Getting his CD's and books is the next best thing.
1,Waste of Money!,Don't bother with this cream. All it did was make my skin dry and 'thirsty.' It didn't do anything with the wrinkles at all. In my opinion it is a complete gimmic and comes from a dubious and 'unregulated' source. A complete waste of money.
4,Works on my forehead frown lines,"I have been using this product for a few years. My frown lines have not gone away, but they haven't gotten worse either. I am 43 and my forehead is mostly unlined. I used to also put it on my crow's feet and smile lines but it doesn't seem to work as well in those areas. I know it works because I went on a two week trip and did not bring it with me. When I got home, my frown lines were deeper!"
4,A window to the past,"The story is slight--one Christmas for a young girl at the turn of the century. But Susan Hill creates the world of a small English village in winter and peoples it with villagers seen through the eyes of a child. Death, birth, joy and awe are all part of the story. It is the perfect length for a Christmas reading. It will become part of my tradition in future years."
5,"Supportive, Encouraging, and Fun","I'm glad this has been in print since 1996. I hope it is available for a long time. It appeals to the imagination of LD children and other children. It is supportive, encouraging, and most of all fun. I didn't see a place to recommend other books so I'd like to mention Little Lemon - Activities for Developing Motivation and Memory Skills by Betsy B. Lee. It has specific strategies along with the story. I think these two books are a helpful combination."
3,tiny shapes,I find most cookie cutter shapes unexciting but I like bugs and flowers. Cook's Illustrated recommends metal cutters over plastic ones. These may call my Forschner cutproof glove into service.The sizes are basically bite size which is just perfect for me plus the designs are just what I like so this set is doubly perfect and I recommend it. I think its okay to make tiny cookies. I can't wait to make different recipes for each shape. And to finally use royal icing.Ideas:gingerbread crocus with lemon icingsugar cookie butterflieshazelnut daisy with raspberry jam centerthyme bee with orange icingsage dragonflymung bean ladybugtarragon cocoa grasshopper with green icingbrown sugar honeycombMade in China
4,Very Nice,"Fits fine, holds the charge and has improved my charge time. Great item. Color on cover is ever so slightly of the pink on the phone but livable."
2,Cute but not especially user friendly,"I like the idea of this mask but I believe it could be improved with some tweaking:1. Don't pack it so full of ""natural buckwheat, rice and spice"" so ita. cannot conform to your eye area;b. make it virtually impossible to get the ""filling"" out to wash the cover (a larger opening?) andc. heavy... it just feels heavy on your face and not in a good way. Perhaps altering the balance of ""filling"" in favor of the lighter, buckwheat hulls.2. Make the strap a soft, wide, fabric-covered elastic. The plain fabric strap with velcro is uncomfortable and the hook part of the velcro gets tangled in your hair easily."
2,A Disappointment,"Being a repeated watcher of their Complete Works of Shakespeare I was really looking forward to this. I could get past the cast change, but for obvious reasons, they saw fit to just bring everything to a screeching halt in order to go after George Bush. Besides rooting this DVD in our current time (how relevant are jokes about Richard Nixon today?) it just went on and on. If you are expecting a companion piece to their previous brilliant work , then give this a pass."
1,Not Good,"I saw these actors live in London, performing The Reduced Shakespeare's Complete Works of William Shakespeare. Afterwards, I immediately set out to purchase that performance on DVD. Thinking that the Complete History of America was of the same caliber, I purchased this DVD as well. It was a waste of money. There were moments of humor, but these moments were few and far between. The most humorous part actually had nothing to do with their skits, but rather occurred ad hoc as they discussed a late arrival to their performance. It was so disappointing that I could not even watch the show to the end. While I highly recommend their Complete Works of William Shakespeare, I would run from their performance of the Complete History of America. Honestly, you could not pay me to watch this again."
1,A piece of junk,"I bought this camera for a Christmas gift. My mistake was to buy it more than 30 days before Christmas [Amazon.com will not refund anything over 30 days]. So I have to eat the [expenditure], I spent. The camera will not take a clear pic,in any setting. All pic look like they are out of focus. In addition the software that comes with the camera continues to create faults and re-boots both of my computers. The camera is going into the wastebasket"
3,doable in a pinch - a real toy camera,"Granted the price can't be beat but what I can't seem to get over is how quickly the batteries run out and how unstable the software seems to be. I take it out to the beach for quick scenic shots. The pics came out decent. Though, any indoor or people shots normally come out rather fuzzy. I didn't take any more that maybe 10 pics each time, but I had trouble getting the software to download them. Had to boot and reboot several times to get the viewer app to load. Photos have to be downloaded right away, as in within an hour, else the battery will deplete and photos are erased. I've lost many that way. It's great for quick snaps for ebay and such, but other than that, I wouldn't count on it for much."
3,Great little camera for traveling or sporting events,"I like this camera because of it's very small size and design. It is great for traveling, hiking, and sporting events. I wouldn't recommend it for someone deeply devoted to photography and great quality. It is a good camera but not a high end camera by any means."
4,"Compact, Candid, and Cheap","Perfect for capturing unplanned memories,easily fits into pant/coat pockets, cheap toreplace if damaged, resolution is lowbut what do you expect from a DigitalCamera under $50? Start your childrenout on this camera and eventuallymove to something better"
2,Cool size but doesn't work,"I was very excited when I got my SiPix after almost two month in order. I love everything about the camera from tiny size, cool design, and resolution. However no matter how much I love it and I can't take any decent pictures. I tried everything possible to get enough light and hold still, the pictures are always blur. I have to return it."
2,compact size,"it's such a cutie,shame the batteries don't last long enough for you to use it properly.also i can't get to grips with the settings before i take any pics,otherwise a real bargain.something to give the kids to let them learn how to use,so they can show me.I CAN'T KEEP STILL TO TAKE ANY STILL PICTURES."
5,Super fun happy camera,please to be buying this camera! wonderful fun and super price for picture taking.
2,Cheap Camera,"I've only had this camera 2 days, the first thing i notice is that the camera is a bit faulty when it comes to battery's even with fresh ones in it sometimes reads them as empty and turns itself off,also the software is a pile of crap, i cant get the camwizard to install on xp, which means i cant see any pics i've taken and i cant upload them"
2,Battery problems,"This is a fun little camera, but very hard to take pictures in any kind of focus, and many pictures are overexposed. The battery runs out extremely quickly, so quickly that I am probably going to ditch the camera, since I don't like filling up household hazardous waste sites with batteries."
2,Digital 101,"If you're looking for an affordable way to test out a digital camera, this is a good place to start. This very portable camera (about the size of a credit card) does perform the basic tasks. The software program is fairly simple, and if you are computer literate, you will have little trouble navigating it. Outdoor shots are better suited to this product, although with good indoor light a quality photo can be achieved. Enough pixels to e-mail a decent photo. Overall, a good starter camera for the money."
1,Can't give it away because its inability to focus.,"I asked several co-workers if they would like to have the camera for free. Unfortunately, they have already heard about the problems of the camera and no one wants it. The biggest problem is that you need it to be perfectly still when taking a picture, or it will be blurry. I am unfortunately unable to keep that still. I ended up buying a new Minolta Dimage XI which takes much better picutres in all kinds of situations.I would avoid this camera at all costs."
1,Much like a poorly edited diary written by a 4th grader,"I do not recommend ""Will This Do?"" It is much like a poorly edited diary written by a 4th grader who constantly pratts on about his success due to his own achievements. The achievements though minor in character were not due to his relatives, endlessly described in his diary and include his brillant father, mother, grandmater, grandpater, eccentric uncle, great great grandfather on his mother's side nor his friend Biff (whose father went to oxford with grandpater). The only thing keeping me from chucking this book into the fire was the fact that it was a library book."
2,Its more than enough,"Perhaps if you grew up in England or knew something about many of the obscure people he mentions and the country houses (Mansions is more like it), I don't know any houses that look like these even of well off friends, you might find it interesting. Much of the material is included in a much better book by his son Alexander Waugh, Fathers and Sons: The Autobiography of a Family. Reading this book at least prepared me with some of the background that Auberon Waugh goes into. I would strongly suggest reading Alexander Waugh's book and skipping Auberon's. His snobbery is boring and after all his real claim to fame is being the son of Evelyn Waugh also snobbish but something that is part of his persona and also something that is not as extreme."
3,"Witty, funny, and eccentric, just like A. Waugh himself.","If you have ever lived amongst the literary or monied class of England, this book is a bittersweet retrospective, a tattle-tale, and an apology all in one. If you haven't, then it seems to be a pompous, overblown biography of a rather ordinary life of a rather unordinary aristocrat. Waugh tells tales of his youth, adolescence, and adult life as best as sees fits, which is to say he writes what he wants you to know, and HOW he wants you to know it. It is, at every turn, witty and funny, and worthy of reading for those reasons alone. For those of you who don't know, Waugh edits the Literary Review magazine, which is available in most English speaking countries, including better parts of the United States."
1,I was fooled by the pictures,"They look very nice on the pictures. I bought the earrings and the matching necklaces. But when I received the real things, they look so crappie. The metal parts and chain have sharp edges all over the places. The ""Black-Diamond Crystal"" are actually cheap plastic beads with big molding offset edges. The service from the seller is even worse. I paid for shipping and have the item returned the next day but only got 60% of my money back. Don't be fooled!"
2,Small,"ALthough I liked these earrings, they were way smaller than I expected - - very pretty blue, vintage feel but much to small for my liking."
3,"Stylish, but not the best stovetop","This VeV model looks slick, aside from the Carmencita it's probably one of the most unique looking stove top espresso machines around. It also fits onto a stove top and makes a coffee quickly on a medium to low flame meaning faster than typical turnaround time. My only problem with this is that it makes virtually no sound when the coffee is moving from the lower chamber into the upper. Therefore you typically only are aware the coffee is ready when it starts spilling out the top. Other than that, the 2 cup device makes two espresso sized cups nicely which is a pretty solid choice for daily use. If I had my druthers however, I'd stick with the Carmencita although I will use this one until it falls apart because it does the job."
5,does it's job to a T,I have the older style hands free First Years gate and was a little concerned if this would fit but it fits perfectly and my gosh it really makes a difference. The gate fit our hallway before the extension but the supports were almost all the way extended so when we saw that the extension was only 15.00 we decided to give it a go.I do not know how we lived without it. It used to be kinda wobbly and I found myself tightening it every few days. I have not had to tighten it since we bought this extension. I is sooooooooooooooooo much sturdier.
4,Hands free gate extension,These extensions are very helpful to get the hands-free gate positioned the right way in different size areas. They are easy to install and hold together well.
4,"Good, but measure first","We really enjoy the gates, but one of them came without a set of parts, so we had to order them, which was a pain because Amazon couldn't do it for us. Also, we installed them in a hallway with irregular molding, and it was hard to install them because the height of the molding was exactly the same as the height of the gates. So for smooth walls and regular doors, they work great; if there's anything irregular about your setup, make sure to measure it first."
4,extension great for medium spaces,"we have a big gap before our bedroom, and we needed in fact 2 of these extensions to make our gate fit. now with one, it seemed it would be sturdy, but with 2 extension, it gets a little flimsy and the whole gate can fall off the wall if you press the foot pedal too hard or shove the gate by mistake..."
5,Works great,"I bought 2 of these extensions to accommodate a 42"" opening to our dining room. They fit the step gate with no problem, installed easily, and are holding securely."
1,Hands Free gate Extension,"I loved the gate. So when I moved to my new house and found that the doorways were wider than the gate, I needed the extension. It was well worth it. My daughter is always pulling on it and hanging on it, and it still stays very sturdy within the doorway. I am also happy that we got to re-use the hands free gate because I would have hated to fasten a gate right onto the wall and make holes in my wall. This gate was a great purchase."
1,Extention Ordering is Misleading,"The hands free gate works beautifully. However, when you need to order extentions for a larger doorway realize one extention kit does not give you the maximum 44"" coverage. I had to order an additional one when I realized the error and had to pay shipping twice."
4,"New House, New Gate Location","We moved to a three story townhouse, and our Hands Free Gates didn't fit in the stairwell (where we needed them most). I found the estensions on Amazon, and in just a few days they showed up, and I was able to make the stairways in the house safe for our 1 year old, without having to invest in new gates."
4,Not as good as being there but pretty real,"This dvd was worth every penny. I've always had the need for speed. IT""S AWESOME!! Flying through the dunes from the p.o.v. of the bumper of a sandzilla rail beats the hell out of my quad. Glamis suck it Glamis!!"
2,It is a good work to put all the information together.,"Some parts are not reflecting the Turkish mentality. It is not the same with local people's daily life. The writer shoud have spent more time with the local people to see the real life, family etc. Although it is a good guide-book, it is not enough for those who would like to learn more about history on the country and the sites. Also there are some parts need to be corrected."
1,A Catastrophic disappointment,"I was looking forward to a light read... I normally read ""The cat who...."" books over a weekend. This one took me 2 long weeks to read because it is so poorly written. The murder hinted at on the cover never transpired; when there finally was a murder it was towards the end and was wrapped up very quickly (by then I didn't care who did it anyway). And the continuity was completely lacking (a toy that Yum Yum is sleeping with on page 221 is taken out of a drawer and introduced to the cats for the ""first time"" on page 231). What a dismal waste of time and mondy!"
1,The Cat Who Liked Red Herrings,"What's going on? Dead ends? Unanswered questions? Red herrings? Ms. Braun has led us down a garden path to a resort town where whodunnit is no surprise, nor are the motives imaginative. I won't even attempt to figure out what she intended with the dead man on the beach. Though she has several excellent tales to her credit, Ms. Braun, or whoever wrote this, might consider re-reading some of her earlier work for inspiration."
2,"Sloppy, very sloppy---","I just finished this one (having read all of the others over the years) and I had to go back and skim it to see if I had missed something. The plot is weak, the many characters fleshed out but superfluous, and the satisfying quality of LJB's other ""Cat Who"" books is mostly missing and just about as thin as watery gravy. Do not read this one if you have never read her earlier books. LJB is getting very old, and I fear she did not actually write this on her own. Whoever helped her out would be well advised to hang it up before it gets more horrible than we, her faithful readers of the past, can bear (very rough paraphrase): 12 pairs of hands from 24 older ladies at Safe Harbor began clapping??????????"
1,Even the hard core won't find much to purr about,"The good news: there's lots of update on small-town life in Moose County. The bad news: the rest of the book. There's no discernible plot. A mystery should mystify. This one airily dismisses its opening ploy (the disappearing hiker) and discloses a murder only through the testimony of a single witness - if Qwill (or Koko) does any detecting, it's not evident here. What was the author thinking? What was the editor thinking to allow this book to damage the reputation of an otherwise delightful series?"
1,What a Mess!,"This is my first Lilian Jackson Braun novel, and will probably be my last. I thought I was reading a mystery; however, Ms. Braun decided to challenge the genre by presenting several mysteries and only resolving half of them. The real kick in the pants is that our hero Qwill has to be told ""who done it"", rather than solve the crime himself. I'm a cat-lover, but not enough to waste my time on such a poorly constructed story."
5,Fun Read,I just love the cats in this book and Mr. Q. Just a fun and quick read when you want something different.
4,The Cat Who Saw Stars,The beginning was a little slow but as I got into the story it started to pick up . It was a very good story as usually.
2,This book is 400 miles in the middle of nowhere.,"This is my first and frankly my last attempt at reading a book by Lilian Jackson Braun up to now the only books that I could not stand were pulp romances. I have found a new can't stand book and this is it. I hope I never run in to the target audience. Because I do not like negative reviews I can say the binding is well made. The book is not too heavy. Oh, they also made a CD of this one."
1,Not even going to bother with it after reading all reviews.,"I have been a devoted fan of Ms. Braun's ""The Cat Who..."" series for years. I almost pre-ordered this book back in November, but something held me back. So today I read every review I could get my hands on for this book, and finally decided that it would not peak my interest and would probably only leave me in the dumps if the various sub-plots were not knotted neatly. So I decided to pass on it. Maybe Ms. Braun will recover from her slump or will develop some other twist for the series. Maybe the publisher WAS to blame for this ""unsolved"" mystery and lack of ""parts"" to be played by the hero's sidekicks. For whatever reason the book was not accepted well, I do believe that Whomever it was that allowed it to go into print as an UNfinished product needs a serious reprimand. I will await the next book by Ms. Braun."
2,"An OK effort, not as good as some of her earlier works","I've read all 21 books in the Cat Who series, and found this one to be a bit of a disappointment. I think the ""surprise ending"" is out of character with the rest of the series, and is kinda stupid. The book is a pleasant enough visit with your favorite Moose County characters, but not much else happens. (Qwilleran doesn't solve anything in this one!) I think Braun is coasting on past successes-- she certainly didn't strain herself on this one."
1,Drivel,"Lilian Jackson Braun's series has become so ""cozy"" that the recent books are almost devoid of elements of mystery altogether--they've become chatty little books about a group of people and their pets. Some of those people I could do without: Polly is the most insipid invention an author could conjure up, and considering the number of times the skinny Braun reminds us that Polly is size 16, I suspect that even the author is contemptuous of her creation. The only public socializing Qwill does with Polly is eating dinner, which doesn't actually surprise me. And the amount of boozing that goes on is hilarious. Can't people in Pickax City visit one another without having a drink to get through it?"
1,Big mistake reading this book,"The author does not get to any point in a timely matter. The end of the book is rushed to the point where many of the mysteries are unsolved. If you read this book you will be frustrated by the ending ""Cat UFO"" with no conclusion."
2,"Not her best, but read the rest","I have read almost all of the Cat Who... books, and this one was clearly the worst of the bunch. The plot was unexciting, the detective work on Qwill's part was absent (another character basically spontaneously reveals what happened), and the ending was completely unrealistic and totally out of character. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do read Braun's other books in the series: she is an awesome writer. Unfortunately, this one fell far short of my expectations."
1,Response to other reviews,"Another reader asked if those of us wondering what happened to the backpacker read the ending. The answer is of course we did but we also know when you find a dead body burried in the sand you don't dismiss it as natural causes in the end of the book. (Sorry for ruining that but really the backpacker doesn't even feature in the story.) I also agree that the Cat series is like ""eating comfort food"", or ""visiting old friends."" LJB provides a nice light read for those of us wanting to get away from the real world for a while but I think to claim the loose endings exist because Qwill is exploring his beliefs gives LJB too much credit for literary talent. The fact is leaving those loose endings is simply messy writing. I am looking forward to the next book because I like the characters but I'm also hoping it is better written."
3,Loose ends left questions,"It seems as if Ms. Braun is no longer taking as much time and care as she used to in writing her books. The reader is left with too many questions. What about the backpacker? What about the Mark Twain celebration? Why the diversion into Crowmania? Also, Qwilleran seemed less involved with the investigation this time. He started out curious about the backpacker and ended up with Owen Bowen and an alien encounter. There was just too much going on in this book that didn't make any sense.Long time readers of the series should at least browse though this installment. No doubt that some of these plot diversions will make future appearances in later books. For new readers, start with the earlier books in the series, you won't be disappointed."
1,Not as good as it should have been!,"Having read all of LJB's ""Cat"" books this one was a big disappointment. I love her books and always eagerly await for the next one to be published. Unfortunately in this one LJB leads us around town with no destination in mind, no interesting characters to discover and nothing to show us except ""sand."" The only mystery here is ""who is wrote this book and why did they bother?"" I know LJB can do better unless the ""green men"" have taken her away! Koko would never push this one off the shelf for a read!"
2,A mystery without a mystery,"I was disapointed in this book- it was like she was sick of writing this series, and especially sick of the mystery part of it. The mystery details were lacking and incidental while Quileran plodded through his vacation with no conflict but a prolonged boredom. Koko should leave him and find a new master, one who is more active."
4,Love the series,Have read all of the Cat books and enjoyed them all. Great books for unwinding at the end of the day.
1,terribly disappointing,"My first thoughts on Ms. Braun was for writing this was of extreme disappointment. Though I have never read any of the other ""Cat Who..."" books, the fact that there were 22 previous to this was some encouragement... that was quickly lost. The story is almost a straight narrative of events, nothing more detailed or fascinating, and the characters were dry and boring. Though reviews of her earlier books give me a bit of hope that at one time Ms. Braun was a better writer, this experience may have put me off for good."
2,The worst yet.,I am a big fan of LJB and Qwill and Koko. Although I did not enjoy this one. The plot was not there nor the humor. I have read all of The Cat Who books at least 6 times and listened to the tapes more. My favorite is The Cat who Played Post Office. PS Please do not give Qwill a dog!!!!!
1,A huge disappointment,"I used to await Braun's new ""Cat Who"" books eagerly so I could snap them up at the bookstore, but the last few have been somewhat disappointing, so I was content to wait for a friend to lend me her copy of THE CAT WHO SAW STARS. I am pleased that I did not pay for this book, and I'm sorely tempted to discontinue reading the series altogether.Actually, I am concerned about Braun's health. This book felt to me like she didn't have the energy to do anything more than slap together a few disjointed Qwill observations on rural life. There isn't even a coherent mystery to follow in this book, and it contains the biggest plot hole I've ever seen: the sleuth decides to just chalk the whole thing up to UFOs.This book can be enjoyed by only Ms. Braun's most die-hard fans, and I am sorry to say I no longer count myself among them."
1,HELLO! Where is the Plot?,"I usually enjoy the ""Cat"" books but with this one I happened to notice that I was on Page 187 and still had no idea what the story was about. What a waste of time and money. I will certainly check the review before I buy another."
2,Don't Start with this Book,"As a big fan of the ""Cat Who"" stories I am let down by this story. Ms. Braun usually does a better job of describing the area, characters, and tying all of the story together. This particular book references UFO's a couple of times but only as a side plot. Also there is reference to people on the beach of the cabin who are not used for anything else in the story.I also missed the cats being more of a center of the story. Koko and Yum Yum are usually a major part of hte story. This time they seemed to be almost an afterthought.I usually recommend Ms. Braun's books with gusto, not this one."
1,The mystery was missing,"I agree with the other readers that this installment in the ""Cat Who"" series does not come up to usual standards. A lot of extraneous loose ends and people are introduced for no seeming purpose, like the woman on the beach and the UFOs. The backpacker mystery is never solved, other deaths (although accidental) are glossed over as everyday occurrences, and Owen's death is confessed. The local color is interesting, but that's about it. The editing is also sloppy. Niagara is misspelled through the first half of the book. Yum Yum sits with Gertrude the Kalico Kat 5 pages before Qwill gives it to her. The 12 pairs of hands at Safe Harbor belong to 24(?) widows. The cats and Polly have become one-dimentionsal backdrops. It may be my imagination, but in this book Qwill the reformed drinker seems to ply guests with liquor (and no food) at every opportunity. Sorry, I'll go re-read an old favorite."
2,But what about.....,I was just getting into the characters in this book and wondering how all of the facets of the story would come together when I noticed that the end of the book was nearing. I wondered how she was going to wrap it all up in just a few pages. I am still wondering. What about the mysterious woman? How does the missing hiker tie in? UFO's? The Sand Giant? What about...? What about...? What about...? Qwill never gave Polly the embroidery he had framed. I am more confused now than I was midway through the book. How did this ever get past an editor?
3,The Beginning of the downward sprial.,As far as I am concerned it is this book that begins the decline of this series. Here you just don't get the feeling that you are reading a story Ms. Braun felt much like writing. Her heart is not in it. There are long discourses on such toatally uninteresting things as roasted potato's on skewers.It is like Ms. Braun is {understandably after 18 books}running out of ideas and is having a tough time filling space. The ending of this book is just plain stupid. It explains where KoKo came from and a more disappointing explanation Ms.Braun just could not have found. It's almost like she just tossed off something to put an end to the book and her out of her misery. From this book on the series is not nearly as well written as the previous books are. For die-hards go ahead if you feel a bad cat who book is better than none. For those just discovering the series stay with the earlier books.
2,Where are the cats,"I've read all of the books in the series. After I read the first one I just kept going and read all of them in a year. I was very disappointed in the lack of including the ""antics"" of the cats. I have 2 cats also and enjoy reading about how they communicate to Quill. Hopefully her next book will enclude more about the cats."
1,This book is more of an outline than a finished work.,"Lillian Jackson Braun latest in the Cat Who series is a real disappointment. The characters have nothing to do, including Koko and Yum-Yum, and Qwilleren himself is reduced to exhibiting unprovoked anger and plodding aimlessly through town. This book is nothing more than a preliminary sketch and sorely lacks the polish and charm of Braun's previous works. The early books when Qwill was still Down Below are by far Braun's best writing and are true to the mystery genre. Sadly,this book doesn't even resemble the same author."
1,Amateurish....did Ms. Jackson Braun really write this?,"Having read all of the previous ""Cat Who...."" books, I looked forward to this latest edition.I had grown fond of the regular characters and light escapism that the rather gentle plots afforded.This latest effort is sorely in need of editing. I don't expect a new reader would become enamored of the series based on this book. Quite frankly, the story appeared to be thrown together (to meet a publishing deadline?) and certainly did not live up to the series' usual standards."
3,A good read but disappointing.,"Having read all the other ""cat"" Books by Lillian Jackson Braun with anticipation of the next to come out, I think this book leaves the reader wanting, looking for the ""hook"" the ""grabber"" something to pull them into the story. It wasn't there. It left a dead body up in the air..how did it get where it was and who did it ? How about the ""aliens"" where were they ? I think fans of Ms. Braun Will be disappointed, it seems that she ended the book just to end it because she ran out of ideas. I reccommend ""cat"" fans buy the book knowing that it isn't as good as the last."
5,Vintage Braun - As Addicting as Chocolate!,"I've been a big fan of the ""Cat Who ... "" series every since grabbing one off a drugstore shelf to kill time while serving jury duty. That was ""The Cat Who Blew the Whistle"". I've since back-tracked through the whole series and like millions of others, wait enthusiastically for the latest installment. ""Cat Who Saw Stars is vintage Braun. All the favorites are back, Qwill, Arch, Mildred and Koko, as well as the Booze Hotel and the FOO restaurant.As always, there is also a tutorial for the reader, this time on the intricacies of knitting.My only complaint and maybe I just missed something, is, what did happen to the hitchhiker?"
2,Not my cup of tea!,"In this novel the author is guilty of breaking the number one rule of all writing...""Show, don't tell"". The story could easily bore the reader to tears as page after page tells a running commentary on the relationship between Pietro , his mother and his environment. The reader is forced to jump from situation to situation the difference being a number of years and a number of different countries. The characters finally introduced to Pietro never at any moment cause the reader to read on in anticipation. If this continual jumping about on the calender is meant to be a metaphor for a Fool's Alphabet then I'm afraid I didn't see it. I managed to force myself to continue reading up to half way but I am afraid that the ending of the book where no doubt all was revealed never came to pass for me. Until this novel, I had been a keen reader of anything written by Sebastian Faulks."
3,A Fools Alphabet,Beautifully stitched story line. Getting the time-line established in ones head a bit of a challenge but then lovely nuances of time and place revealed.
4,Well put together,This is one helpful book for NT certification. Seller was also very helpful in filling order.
2,Not much meat on these bones....,"This is a story about why these boats were made, not how they were made. It was an interesting story of how a native people are trying (and largely succeeding) to hang on to an important tradition. Boatbuilding, not so much..."
5,Excellent Tripod,Comes fully assembled. Made from quality materials with better than average workmanship. Appears to be identical to DeWalt tripod that sells for almost twice the price.
1,Beware,"I am a PC challenged person and the product is sofeware. Because of my limitations, I made my selection carefully. The product was described as XP Compatible. My operating system is Windows XP on my Dell Inspiron/5100. After many hours of trying to install this program, it is my belief that the program is not compatible with laptops. I wished that the descriptions had included the aforementioned.Amazon.com has been a pleasant experience. However, because of my limited knowledge, I best purchase software off-line."
2,Book Doesn't Discuss Many Important Topics,Doing construction work for the past 25 years makes me very knowledgable about houses. I bought this book to become a home inspector and found it to be lacking in many ways to say the least. Your local handyman could teach you more about inspecting houses than this book can. The most important topics for home construction and inspections were not even discussed in this book.
1,Terrible book for anyone who knows home inspections.,The author of this book needs to learn proper home inspection procedures before he sells himself as knowledgable. I have been inspecting homes for 19 years and often give lectures on the topic. After reading most of this book I realized what a waste of money it was because the information was incorrect or incomplete. I can't believe how many mistakes I found in this book. I'm glad I returned it for a refund on my money but not happy I wasted my time reading it!
1,I do not recommend this inspector book.,"For many years I have been working in real estate and I found this book to be very brief and basic. I cannot see how a home owner would benefit from the basic advice talked about in this book. Perhaps a book on home contstruction would be far more helpful to you. My customers ask me for advice about books to read when they buy a house and this is not one of the titles I would give them. This is not an expensive book but my main concern is reading a good book that I can learn from, not just getting a low price on it."
5,Perfect,"I am a degreed engineer w/ 25yrs. experience in the residential / commercial construction industry. I found Mr. Cauldwell's book to be informative, professional and enjoyable to read. I would highly recommend this book to professionals in the construction field who are considering the Home Inspection profession. Yet anyone interested in home inspection would greatly benifit from this book and it's a terrific value for the money.Thank you Mr. CauldwellEd Szajna Bayport, NY"
5,Inspecting A House,"This is a great starter book for a general introduction into the field of home inspection. It is widely used and recommended for the Humber College - online home inspection certificate program.Over 100 online course participants have commented on the easy reading style, and excellent photographs that accompany this book. Its also used in our face to face delivery. Its personally one of my favourites."
3,Interesting story,Interesting book written in the early 1970's about the British Free Corps.The author basically shows that the members of this unit were the dregs and misfits of British society.He used pseudonyms for the members of the BFC to protect their identities but I feel that real names should be used.I feel that these men after reading several books on the BFC that these traitors are comparable to John Walker Lindh (an American serving with the Taliban in Afghanistan)who should have had stiffer prison sentences after the war.
5,Matters of the Heart,"Bob Bennets Small Graces is outstanding. I just wish I had his entire collection.I have been searching long and far for ""Matters of the Heart""I used to have it as a kid, but the tape got messed up.If ANYONE, and I mean, ANYONE has it or know where to find it, please let me know how I can get a copy. P>Thank You Kindly"
4,"An ""Underdiscovered"" Artist","A powerful poet and musician.... Few artists reveal or translate emotion in their music as effectively as Bob Bennett.In this, his sixth ""album,"" Bob Bennett continues his rich vocal blends and pleasant acoustical melodies. The album is at once uplifting and pensive for the Christian or Seeker. Discover Bob Bennett for yourself."
2,question,"I have a question for the people that have ordered any of the Jack Paar DVDs.....Are there any shows with Brother Dave Gardner on the show???He was guest host june17,1958 but was on the show many many times.I would like to order that particular DVD,if anyone has seen him on the DVD that they ordered.Please list which DVD he is on...Thank you soooo much...cj"
3,"Good introduction to Pimsleur's technique, but . . .","This four tape (eight lessons) set will not teach you enough Portuguese to be useful. But if you want an introduction to the Pimsleur technique, which involves listening to native speakers, repeating what they say, and translating from English (no text), then consider buying these tapes. It will allow you to see if this method of instruction is for you before buying the full, two volume course..."
2,Not much of a good read,"I'd heard of ""langauge poetry"" from some literary friends and picked this up to see what one of its advocates was up to. Prof. Hejinian may be a fine teacher and person, but most every time I waded into this volume, the results were disappointing. Many of her selections seemed to like the sound and juxtapositions of certain phrases, but their meaning often escaped me, overall. Without that, this reader wondered what was the point."
3,elephants and blind men,"I have loved poetry ever since childhood; my first favorite poem started, ""Once there was an elephant who tried to use the telephant."" As I've matured, so has my taste in poetry. Rather than ranting against this poetry as I've done on another review I've decided to accept that this poetry is cutting edge and a little over my head right now. A book of The Best American Poetry should seek out poems that are the highest state of the art and not put out a book of the best liked poems. So, -feeling some envy of those who can enjoy such poems, I will spend my time, as I have for years, on those poets in between the Best and the Worst."
3,Review of carafe.,The carafe is what we were looking for but you sent us the wrong colour. We ordered white and a black trim was sent. 50:50 chance of getting the colours right and you failed.
5,Excellento,This was a great story never would've that they would take that route. I'm waiting on another to come out. The person who played Capatain Hook was an excellent hook. A must see.
4,i like it,Its an after the fact prequel Syfy put out about what made Peter Pan become to boy we know him as(keep in mind this is not written by JM Barrey. Its a version where Peter and James Hook were friends and partners in crime (literally). James wanted an orb but Peter didn't know why. Peter broke into a building so that James could find what he was looking for and it turns out (I'm not telling you much) that it is a transmitter to Neverland. A place on the other side of the solar system where there are fairies and pirates and indians have come from earth. In Neverland they don't age. Tiger Lily is apparently over 100 years old. Its how Hook and Pan went from being friends to the rivals we all know them as.Its not written by JM Barrie but inspired by his story like so many others.Everytime I see the guy who plays Hook I think about the character he played in Notting Hill and him standing at the door with his underwear wedged up his butt but other than that lol its a really good story.
3,Neverland,"Entertaining if you love mini series. It is a typical syfy mini series, the acting was not bad but was also not exceptional. All in all, I thought it was a fun reimagining of Neverland and all it entails."
3,Before Peter Pan,"Neverland is the history of Peter Pan before Peter Pan. It is a great idea by the people who brought you Tin Man. It has a number of faults including too much green screen vs actual sets, some acting that needs work, and some editing to the story. Overall it is fun and imaginitive. Hook's history is more interesting than Peter's. Tinkerbell is too much CGI. A fun ride with a lot of bumps."
3,Disappointed.,"Having enjoyed Alice in Wonderland by the same director, I sought out this movie. Disappointed. Timing wasn't quite right, didn't like the editing. It seemed wooden and forced, even with quality actors. Needed more money spent? Better special effects, engaging music... something. Poorly produced film, should have been better."
3,Dead words live,"Picked up this cd , which is out of print because I knew that Robert Hunter was the grateful dead lyricist. With the addition of John Cipollina of Quicksilver fame and Jorma k. from the airplane and Merl saunders on keyboards what a mix! The only weak link is Robert's vocals a few are melodic but some are strained. The true meat of this mind meal is the the words themselves which flow like lavender scented honey. The background music is good country rock almost New Rider with out the pedal steel on every cut. I would have to say that this Rock novel, it has a plot line throughout is still for serious dead heads and 60's music mavens.It is easy to see where the words came from for alot of great Jerry's kids songs."
3,"Okay, but nothing spectacular","I got this book because I had never read a novel written from a native Irishman's point of view. I was looking forward to learning new slang and getting a feel of rural Irish culture in the 19th century. The story was okay, but it wasn't very memorable. I read it a couple of months ago and I don't even remember how it ends, which is pretty rare for me."
2,it was not what i expected,i purchased this for my reef tank. i didn't use it. i didn't like it. #1 its made from china. the paint on the ship looked toxic so i really did not want it anywhere my reef. maybe it just wasn't for me. thanks -Nick
5,Rambo 1-3,"wow, the Blu-ray from Rambo 1-3 is amazing what a perfect picture and sound. i can only say who love the rambo films must buy the collection."
4,its rambo,"all i can say is, it is what you expect from stallone. bad acting but lots of action and killing and overall just manly stuff. a set of movies thats you know is not good but you still love to watch"
4,Pure Action,Rambo it's just a classic among the action movies. I bought this box to complete my collection of action movies. There are so many movies probably better than this but I considered it a classic so i got it. It's entertaining and it's packaged with a lot of action
4,Great Action!!!,"I enjoyed the Rambo Trilogy so much I purchase the latest movie to complete the collection. The creativity of the action sequences are top notch for its time and the beautiful sceneries in blu-ray certainly enhanced the quality. If you are looking for plenty action and fun, this is worth it.My only challenge was the pricing. The boxset was $32.99 when I purchased it and I realised after that they were individually sold for $9.99. Then the box set dropped to $24.98 a couple days later. While I appreciate Amazon's great value and specials it is something to consider. However, the price of the Rambo 1-3 Boxset is still worth it."
4,"Memories of the 80's, RAMBO",Good picture quality for an 80's movies on blu ray while audio is somewhat good too. A nice box set to own if you are a fan.
3,Rambo III review part 2 part 1 on Rambo III Blu Ray reviews 7.5/10,"Back to my Rambo III review. The part where Rambo & Truatman are surrounded I love the part where Rambo says ""F**k em!"" That whole finish of the movie rocked btw C4 tipped arrows ftw. So it's a good sequel that comes pretty close to 1st blood Part 2."
3,Stick with DVD version for now,"While I love the series, it's not worth the price to get it in Blu-ray..."
4,what dts/5.1 sound,"This a great package overall, much better than what is availible here in Australia but the dts/5.1 mix on the first two movies is non existent everything comes through the center channel you get more out of the channels on your surround system by watching them in two channel mix the third movies fine."
3,Good movie's...Not so good special feature's,"I really used to like the rambo movie's but was never what you'd call a HUGE fan.The first one was the best then i think they basically should have laid it to rest,cause it was a good classic.And no one really cared what happened to rambo after that.They just new he was upset and needed to start a new life,which would have been better.But all in all the other to movie's were'nt all that bad.The bone i have to pick is with some of the special feature's on the disc,there is to much Documentury material,about Vietnam,Afghanistan,etc.And also some lame elements about how they used mythological stories and images to come up with the charactar's and the movies.This is Rambo people,an X veteran of NAM,not Hercule's or Zeus,he seeks out and destroys enemies plain and simple.Just kinda ridiculous if you ask me.But not a bad box set if you just like the movie's,although interesting you can watch the History channel to hear about the Story's of war."
2,Not So Ultimate/Stick With Special!,"What a waste! How else can I say it? The Special Editions had trailers, great documentaries, and informative production notes on top of that. Why didn't they include the deleted scenes?! That's the only thing of value on these new Ultimate Editions, because all the rest is missing. If it really was an ""ultimate"" set, they would have included all the previously released great extras. (For those with the far-superior Special Editions, don't bother replacing yours with these; even the deleted scenes aren't anything to get worked up about, with possible exception of First Blood's alternate ending.) And those nonsense ""Meta"" features are a pathetic insult to serious collectors. Can't comment on audio commentaries. I gave up wasting my time on those things years ago, having OD'd on them back in the days of laserdisc!"
1,Totally Waste of Money,"First : Where are the special features were available in ""Special edition"" Release?Second : There is nothing tempting on these Disks! Nothing. even deleted ScenesThird : They say these movies are mastered in high definition. yes. bitrate is very high. but quality is nothing better than ""Special edition"" & they sacrificed DTS sound although all 3 Discs had enough remaining space for DTS!Fourth : DVD Cases are defected. there is no way to remove disks from them without a fingerprint or scratch! Buy it and experience it!Fifth : Print quality on DVDs are as good as Pakistanese bootleg DVDs!"
2,Lipstick on a Pig,"The only reason this gets 2 stars is that First Blood is a decent movie. The other two are horrid examples of sequels gone bad. Putting them on BluRay is like putting lipstick on a pig.... No matter how red those lips get, it's still a pig."
1,Stop!,Horrible movie. C'mon! Rambo?! Its like my Grandpa trying to scare me! Not realistic. I enjoyed the first ones...but this is Too much
5,great collection,"great collection, had to pull the trigger when it was on the ""lightning deal"" for $18. reminded me when i was younger and would watch the Rambo cartoons and had the action figures.. it's a must for any decent collection."
5,Awesome,"Everything arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The ""Ultimate Edition"" isn't ultimate at all, it's probably the worst special feature I've ever seen but you don't have to do mess with it if you don't want."
3,Metawhat! not impressive,"Nice box if you want to have all Rambo's movies but don't buy for the MetaStuff. This extra is far from being impressive and when I've tried to watch them on my computer, it's just frozen it. I was really disappointed as well as for the alternate ending in the first Rambo. If you already have the movies, don't waste your dollars on this box."
5,War Action + Sylvester Stallone = The Perfect Movie,"No one could have played the part of Rambo better than Sylvester Stallone. He fits the profile of an invincible soldier perfectly: his war-trained, war-stricken , ripped-out body; his serious, aggressive, and somber disposition; and his reputation of being a hardcore action-packer. If Stallone alone isn't enough to draw you to the movie, the action contained within is. From crashing helicopters, to explosive arrows fired from his compound bow, to highly explosive napalm bombs, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. A single viewing will not be enough once you have seen the series once. Inevitably you will want to see it again, so I recommend purchasing it."
4,Rambo apologist,"I have this soft spot for Rambo movies - except for the last one, that one was a piece of crap. But the first 2 were great action flicks, specially in light of the times they reflect. some cheesy lines along the way, but the action is awesome...Blue-Ray, thank you..."
2,Plastic treasure chest,"When the chest arrived the bottom right corner was broken. There we no broken pieces in the box so it must have been broken before it shipped. Due to the urgency of the timing of when I needed to use the chest, I had no choice to to use the broke chest. I was disappointed."
3,About what you expect,"I purchased this treasure chest to hold novelty prizes for my library's summer reading program. It's about what I expected. It looks exactly like the picture. It is very large and holds a lot of trinkets. My only complaint is that it came with the lid taped to the bottom with massive amounts of packaging tape, which did not come off cleanly. There are a lot of large spots with sticky residue that is a magnet for lint and fuzz. It just looks bad. Shrink wrap would have been better."
1,WORST CD I'VE EVER HEARD!!,"The quality is so poor, as if it had been made in someone's garage. Buy the original songs, not these poor re-mixes!"
2,Marine Aquarium + Sharks,"It's nice,but not as beautiful as Marine Aquarium 2.5 and a have all of them."
4,"pretty pictures, disappointing stories.","I bought this book because the pictures were pretty, but as I started to read some of the stories, I found they inserted interpretations that are not in the bible. It's not just with a few, either. Many stories have added emotions, characters, and conversations that aren't in the scriptures. It's almost like stories based on the bible, which is slightly disappointing.Other than that, it seems like a good way to teach children the basics of the bible stories, and the end is nice."
5,Making Faces,walks you through step by step in his lessons. i love that b/c its great for beginers. Or for pros you can just mimic his great faces.
2,Written by Liberals,"I am currently taking a course with this book as required reading. The book is very well organized, well written, and easy to read, however, the reason I only give 2 stars is because this book is NOT objective in its approach to teaching the material. The authors clearly would like to see the USA become a socialistic state with funding for welfare programs to go through the roof. It is obvious that they would like the government to be in charge of redistributing the money successful people have made to people who have not been so fortunate.I'm interested in a less subjective view of Human Services. I didn't take this class to listen to a rant against Republicans."
3,Intro to Human Services,There is a ton of information in this text. I do think it is entirely too wordy! I understand that a text needs to give information and examples but this text could have been a bit more direct.
5,One of the best scents out there,"Burburry Brit is one of the best, most masculine and freshest scents out there. I love it. It carries such a clean, even fresh scent filled with wood and citrus tones but not overbearing. It last quite awhile. I have had more compliments on this one than any other and I have worn many. many different colognes over the years. You can wear this for any occasion any time of the day or night. I have even found my eight year old boy sneaking in to the closet to spritz himself with this before he goes to school....so, that says something too! If you're looking for a reasonably priced unique manly scent this is it."
5,i like eggs,"this video is so funny, I love Amanda Bynes and the crazy things she does in the show. from the hillbillies to the girls room with ""I like eggs"" I love it :)"
3,Loved it...but...,"Over all, I would say this book is a very good read. The main characters are well defined, and their quirks and insecurities only make them easier to care about.The storyline was laid out well, although, in my opinion, the climax was a bit unbelievable. If Carr were to return with these ladies I would probably purchase it... I would love to see them a couple of years into their relationship.A couple of things that I didn't care for, was the neverending use of the word 'friend'. Also, I read romance novels for the love scenes. I am not saying it has to be soft porn, but a good steamy love scene or two never hurt any romance."
3,Deb,"It was okay. It was too predictable. There weren't any suspense in the book. I also didn't care for the romance because one of the main characters wasn't very appealing, she was weak and unattractive."
4,Dorothy and Toto would've had so much fun...,"This is a delightful book about ways to have fun in Kansas City! When my friends and family found out I was moving to Kansas they were so full of remorse for me---you know, the stereotypes of flat, flat, flat cornfields with remnants of Dorothy's house, one-room school houses and forgotten lands (no, make that undeveloped lands) where everyone wears gingham frocks and plays their fiddle after dinner (nothing wrong with that!)...well, this book is going home, to EVERYONE'S home that I know for Christmas this year! HAH! Look who's house will be the guest flop next! Thanks for your fun book!"
5,Book Delivery,"I was very pleased with the promptness with which my book arrived, and with the excellent condition of both the packaging and the book itself."
5,Not the Cheaters shoe that many claim,"Gms are amazing shoes!THey are as advanced as pointe shoes get. Don't believe the rumors about the shoes being ""cheater shoes"" thats the old school thought of ""no pain no gain""The shoes are incredibly strong and very comfortable. They are also very quiet and perfect for romantic ballets.PLEASE be sure that you get the PROPER fit by a GM fitting PROFESSIONAL and know your codes!!!"
1,Paramount is the pits,"Great show, but as is the case with many Universal/Paramount releases, they simply stop releasing DVD's after a few seasons if they think that the show isn't selling well enough: Even if the low sales are because of splitting seasons into volumes and ultimately charging twice as much per season. They are notorious for ending the release of a series after a season or two. Some real geniuses working there. I'm now stuck with partial runs of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Night Gallery, etc... and now Cannon. If you like to collect full runs of classic TV shows like I do, it's almost better not to buy the first seasons from Universal/Paramount in the first place. They're the the worst, and obviously couldn't care less about their customers."
5,"hey, where's season 3? or 4 or 5","I once again enjoyed watching the early seasons of this show, now come on, Paramount, lets get the rest of them out so we can watch 'em."
4,Great Show / Fair Picture Quality,"Cannon was one of the best P.I. shows of all time. It is a shame CBS Paramont isn't remastering this series. I have the first season of Barnanby Jones, (another Quinn Martin Production) It has been remastered, and looks great! Come on CBS Paramount, give Cannonthe same treatment."
1,volumes of seasons?,The show is great. The set is not. Splitting up a season is like a cake without the icing. As smart as splitting War & Peace into War. And Peace.
5,"Meet Elmore Leonard, the man behind all those novels","If you have seen the movies based on Elmore Leonard's novels (""Get Shorty,"" ""Out of Sight,"" etc.), then you have probably wondered what sort of guy WRITES stuff like this. Well, ""Elmore Leonard's Criminal Record,"" a 1993 BBC documentary shows us the man behind the curtain. Over a dozen of Leonard's novels have made it to the silver screen and if you wondered why his books seems so adaptable the answer is that the author researches his characters by watching videotaped interviews with cops, judges, bail bondsmen and the like. You also get the bonus of Leonard reading from ""Killshot"" and other favorites. This is one of the few documentaries on a contemporary writer that actually gives you some insights. But please remember: you are still required to read the man's books, not just see the movies."
5,Excennet book,This book was in perfect condition. As promised. Received before the expectant promised date. Thanks for the excellent and fine service. .
3,Not so simple,Neither the game or this book is so simple which makes it good but not great. I learned a lot from it.
2,Not much here.,"Before i bought this book i read reviews on here and figured it was good. Turns out its a short book and has nothing to offer if u have Nimowitzes . my system or any other good all around chess book. I find 100 page chess books are lame, u can find a better book for same price and get what the 100 page book tells u and more."
5,Superb Introduction to Chess Strategy,"I had never heard of this book until someone recommended it on a chess forum a couple of years ago. Since that time I have read this book 3 times, and it is a joy to work through every time. Stean does a nice job explaining the different concepts, and has chosen a nice collection of games to annotate and illustrate the points he is trying to make.Topics covered include outposts, weak pawns, open files, half open files and the minority attack, black and white squares, and space. Games involving Botvinnik, Tal, Petrosian, Bronstein, Benko, Najdorf, Fischer, and Spassky along with others are included in the book. At 160 pages it is a fairly easy to work through, and at $9.95 it is a great deal.I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for an introduction to chess strategy."
5,An eye-opener,"If you want a book about chess strategy,this is the one.it is simply written,and still very instructive.An eye-opener for weak players and a great guide for stronger ones.Highly recommended !"
5,Not a book for beginners. Fantastic for the right audience.,"I made the mistake of purchasing this book as a beginner. It collected dust on my shelf for a long time. I've since read it, and it's probably one of the best books on Chess I've ever read. After reading the first couple chapters, I promptly went out and trounced someone rated 200 points higher than me. It's great.It's also short, so it can be easily read in a couple of days. Also, work through the games. You won't get much out of it if you don't. At least not the first time through."
4,Good for the price.,"I'm really happy with this purchase because we can carry everywhere and my son is more integrated to the family's table.Only con is that if your kid is strong enough, he/she can open the straps on his/her lap just by moving to a side. Bottom line, keep him/her as close to the table as you can so nothing else keeps your baby's attention.It is also REALLY easy to clean."
5,Perfect for Hip Dysplasia Babies,"After our daughter was diagnosed with hip dysplasia, we bought this booster seat as a recommendation from many parents of DDH children. It arrived just 1 day after her surgery and was a COMPLETE LIFESAVER. If your child is having an open or closed reduction with a spica cast, this seat is a must. It was the only thing that would allow her to sit upright with us at the table with her legs hanging off the sides. For all other purposes, it's a great seat and the cushion is completely deflatable so you can take it with you wherever you go and it flattens out. We've saved it for any time we eat at someone's home rather than bringing the big high chair.It does get crumbs in the cracks, but it's so easy to wipe those up. Since it's plastic you can just hose it off. I only wish the backing was a little more sturdy. The straps were really what held our daughter up in place.Also, great purchase for the price."
2,Not a great product,"It's too light and not firm and sturdy. Our 15-month-old daughter usually can sit pretty still, but even she gets toppled over once in a while in this seat. My husband and I have to sit closely on either side of her to make sure she does not fall off. I wonder if the eddie bauer one is better, but now that I have bought this one we have to make do with it. I wouldn't recommend it to others."
2,unstable seat,"This seat was a gift and I thought it was an ingenious idea. It had pockets to put diapers and whatnot in it, but the problem was that if you didn't put an even amount of diapers in the base of it, it was an unstable seat for babies and toddlers. Great idea, but maybe a stable base to put diapers in would had to the function of the seat."
2,hmmmmm,"I didn't have any problems with the ordering or shipping. That went well. However, I wouldn't recommend this seat. My kids leaned over to far and almost fell out. I don't feel it's really safe.."
2,Not tall enough,I bought this for my 1.5 year old son and found that it simply isn't tall enough to allow him to sit comfortably at the table. It really only added a few inches to the height of the chair. We've never had a highchair at home; we've always used a Fisher Price Healthy Care booster (which we LOVE). That seat works great at local restaurants and friend's houses. We were looking for a light-weight alternative for international travel and found the First Years booster to just be too short for our son to actually feed himself. Might work well for a child at 2 years OR if you mostly feed your child (instead of having him/her self-feed with utensils or hands). Too bad because it is a nice little compact product.
5,Great for Guests or Travel,"I've had this booster seat for over a year and have found many uses for it. It's not only great for travel, but is useful when a friend comes over and needs a booster seat for their child. My own children are out of high chairs and booster seats, but this one is so compact that I keep it nearby and use it when guests need it. This would be a great gift for grandparents who don't want a bulky booster seat."
5,Great for on the go!,This booster seat is great. It is compact and stores easily when not in use. It is able to be securely fastened to all kinds of chairs so it's perfect for restaurants and dinner at friends. A friend of mine also throws hers in the washing machine. I've never tried it because I think it cleans up nicely for our occasional use but good to know.
5,Very useful,"We take it with us when we travel, very useful, or daughter loves to sit on the table on a normal chair, so this is perfect to make that happen."
1,Not Efficient,I got this for my son when we visit friends and family so we don't have to drag his high chair along. We ended up having to buy a real booster seat anyway. This seat is very unstable and just isn't safe or efficient.
2,Deflation,Great idea. But having a problem with right side deflating. Can't figure it out. Just the one side. Was great before it broke with less than a year of use.
3,never properly inflates,"This is a great way to keep your munchkin safe on a regular chair, but it doesn't bring baby up to table height. Mine has never inflated properly but we still use it for traveling since it keeps baby safe."
5,A very good solution for traveler,"The booster seat gives us a good solution for meals during travelling around U.S.We used it anywhere - in diners, retaurants, homes, hotels and more..."
4,Pleased,"We just did a 2 week vacation with our 11 month old twins with two of these. They were really invaluable as we visited different family and friends' houses and stayed in a hotel. We had no problem with the inflation. There were a few things about it that keep us from rating it a 5 star: the straps are not detachable for a thorough cleaning and there are no shoulder harness straps so the babies were constantly leaning all over the place making it hard to feed them, but we never felt they were unsafe. It was very nice that they were boosted up to table height, which several other seats we considered didn't have that ability. If you're going to use this for local use, I'd recommend a booster seat with a tray to help keep the babies in place and an easier feeding situation. However, for travel, it does the job!"
2,Don't buy for younger baby,"I thought this item would be okay for my 11 month old for a few weeks while we were without our usual high chair but it is not. She felt VERY insecure it in, even pushed up to the table. She would cry when I placed her in it. Because it is not enclosed I think for the first time she could tell how high up off the floor she was. She is a great sitter but the side strapes are not very securing either, and at the tightest she still would lean over to the side. I think this product will be better for her when she is older, when she is able to almost sit like a big girl at the dinner table. I also do not feel that it inflates well, and sinks down towards the back, tilting her backwards. I do plan to keep this item for the future and perhaps I will review it again when she is older."
2,not thrilled,"We bought this chair to use as an everyday booster seat for our toddler. I found it quite easy to attach to a chair (and remove and reattach when traveling). However, after only a short period of use, the chair became very lopsided and will not sit straight. We have a second one at Grandma's house which does the same thing. Also, the chair stains very easily and is quite difficult to clean. Crumbs are forever trapped between the seat and the back/sides. We attached the seat to our dining room chair, and the way the booster rubs against the wood removed the finish from our chair.Overall, this product is priced well, and would be fine if you only plan to use it once in a while. Now that our second child is ready for a booster, I'm looking for a solid plastic chair."
5,The Budapest Gambit,"I personally spent about one and one half years trying to find a reply that I liked against queen pawn openings. I finally was convinced by this book that the Budapest was for me. The book is very well written. It helps you quickly find the variations that you would like to play and contains many subvariations in model games to help you against strong moves as well as unusual moves. And many club players don't encounter it often, so the opening has surprise value. The top scholastic players in this area use it on a regular basis. If you like to attack, and hate defensive positions against 1. d4, then try the Budapest Gambit."
2,Please Don't Buy,"I rented this movie at my local library thinking I would buy it, like I bought many others. Are you kidding me the woman had spunk and a little sass that said that she had a brain and she demanded respect for herself. Somewhere between beginning and middle she became a brainless cryer.The prince was a boring lazy nare-do-well along with his rich and a obnoxious friends. The other prince was selfish and a workaholic. Tell me which one would you pick. Me neither one of them. Who does she pick and why ? A leopard doesn't changes it spots.Club Med anyone????????????So far this was THE worse K-Drama I've seen so far."
4,Good stuff!,"My family has been using this for about 5 months now. It has a wonderful flavor, but sometimes the fish flavor coming from the seaweed is strong. I'm not a big lover of strong fish tastes, but the Japanese would find this a mild taste."
2,No gentle warm up,It starts out with the cardio workout and there is no warm up. There should be a gentle warm up since this is for a woman who has recently had a baby and has to be gentle on her body.
1,awful workout,"I love Denise Austin, and always have, but this dvd is awful. She is going at such a fast pace that I couldnt keep up with her at all. One of the moves put alot of strain on my ankels and shins. Even after doing the workout 4 times a week for over a week I still just could not get the hang of it. Wish I wouldnt have bought it."
2,De Blij,"Convoluted, has a chapter devoted to American housing styles, he talks with his hands, run away, run far away..."
4,Going In Style - when simple works,Lots of cliches - lots of fun to watch these three work. The computer animation and special effects were left out and it makes it all the better.
4,A Great Caper Film for the Young and Old,"""Going In Style"" is one of those rare movies that has a clever concept as well as a character-driven story. Burns, Carney, and Strasberg all give fine performances as three retirees who decide to spice up their dull lives by robbing a bank.This film proves that youngsters can enjoy a movie about oldsters when the characters in it try to find a way to feel young again.The DVD also has interviews with Art Carney and George Burns on the Dinah Shore show, which is very funny. I would have liked to see more features, though, like commentary by writer/director Martin Brest. Otherwise, a great caper movie for the young and young at heart."
5,Freedom of Expression for Suicide Bombers,"For years now, sympathic voices have been explaining to the media, and the world, why troubled souls resort to killing themselves because they have no other means to further their cause.Finally, Pierre Rehov goes into the prisons and interviews the suicide bombers who were apprehended before they were able to complete their mission. Finally, the world can hear first hand the motives behind the suicide bombings. But the world will only hear if they care enough to listen.Once the world listens, it will know how to act... if it is not too late."
2,Not what I wanted,"This does not have the radio version of the song on it, instead it is called pop & club mixes. Four different versions and bonus beats. Heavily synthesized! The funny part is that you can actually make out more of the words in these versions! Not what I was looking for!"
3,my review,"there was only one song that i really liked. After playing it over so many times, i started to get tired of it."
3,Castro Bias,"I also saw this film @ the Toronto Film Fest. While it gave a different (Castro) Point of view, that was refreshing, but it was clearly biased, especially after having recently been to Cuba. Things aren't great... and it's not completely the fault of the US... Fidel Castro is a Capitalistic Opportunist. Communist? Socialist? Maybe 40 years ago... Now, he's living the POSH life and hated in Havana."
5,Great film,"I was not going to buy this because I thought it was a documentary seeing as how they have the real Fidel Castro on the cover. However this is a movie and a great one I might add. This is the next best thing to ""Che"" as far as films go about the Cuban Revolution."
4,could be better,"If somebody wants to tell a story on Fidel Castro, it has to be told in Spanish. Listening to Fidel and the Ché speak broken English is I guess like listening to Chairman Mao tell his life story in French, or something like that. The film loses a lot of power by just not allowing the characters express themselves verbally in their own language. Still, a good film not to me missed."
3,full of drama,"The cover here may look happy, but this is far from a happy movie. Don't fear, there is a somewhat happy ending, but it basically plays out like your average soap opera- back stabbing, betrayal, and all that jazz. It's one of those movies you watch more than once because all in all, it's a satisfying story. Best of all, it co-stars Sandra Bullock!"
3,"When the party is over, you talk about yours mistakes...","Good movie, I was happy to see Sandra Bullock with an attitude. The true story about your friend a the corner of the street, the up & down of comming out of college and in the Adult-life.The only thing that bored me is the ""Documentarie"" look or all the ""Flash-back"" episodes. It is the story of a bunch of kids who speak up about there relashionship and how the have been throught that. They're all bad-mouthing every one and finaly realise that life is a B**ch... :) and when they talk about an event, well, you see it in ""Flash-Back"".Rae Dawn Chong is great in the ""Handy-Abused-Friend-who's-having sex-with-everybody"" !"
1,What a waste of time,"I didn't think it was possible that I would NOT like a Sandra Bullock movie - that's like not liking Tom Hanks right? However, as they say, you can't win them all. This movie was a total STINK-O story. Sandra as always puts in a good performance, but the characters and story are just not worth the time of day. This movie should be buried in an unmarked grave and forgotten. Skip it - she has so many other good ones."
5,ac powered,"I bought the Chill Hub to use as a cooler when I am printing pics or other things. I have two other coolers--used for different applications. All 3 of these cooolers do their job well. I was especially attracted to the Chill Hub because it uses AC power not power from a usb port and it has 2 very large fans situated in the middle of the unit. This particular cooler blows air into the backside of the computer. The fans are very strong and create alot of airflow into the computer. It also has 4 usb ports so my printer is plugged into it all the time. All i have to do is connect the chill hub to my computer and I'm ready to go. A very ""cool"" product. Highly recommened but be sure to look for this exact model as other Targus chillers are not the same. This is the best one they make."
1,Broken after 1 day!,"I bought this chill pad & within 24 hours one fan stopped working. Within 48 hours the second fan failed. So beware, this is not going to last!!"
3,One Year Warranty,"One year warranty is very accurate; that is about all it will last. The fans are cheap and will fail (very loudly) within one year even with no visible damage. However, while it works, it works very well. The frame is sturdy but not flat; the laptop will rub the case surface midway between the two front top rubber feet. I would buy a replacement if it was made with higher quality fans."
3,Targus Notebook Chill hub,I though this product did a pretty good job of cooling the computer however I wasn't able to velcro it to the bottom of the laptop like I was with my original chill pad. It worked pretty good didnt have any major coplaints beyond that.Then after 3 months of use I had one of the fans attached to this experience a massive blade failure with two of the blades completely cracking apart and coming off. Targus was happy enough to be willing to send a replacement however when I got the replacement they sent the ORIGINAL Chillhub not the newer model.
1,Hub Hangs,"I replaced a 3 year old cooler that was too small to use with the docking station. I liked the idea of the USB hub because I often have a wireless mouse, USB floppy, several USB hard drives, TV adapter, digital audio converter and a numeric key pad in use.The cooling fans work great and are a necessity with graphics heavy processing such as 3D games like Quake or Halo.Unfortunately, I will have to return it. When my Compaq X1000 powers on or just reboots with the cooler USB hub connected the machine hangs on BIOS initialization. I have to remove the USB connect to the cooler hub, force a power off and re-power. After Windows is up I can reconnect the hub."
2,The Pits,"Climbing for 20 years I have thumbed my way through a fair share of guidebooks. This book is very poorly done.I would consider Richard Rossiter's Eldorado Guidebook to be the 5 star Cadillac of FrontRange guidebooks. Along side this Hubbel's book wreaks. If you don't get lost in transit to a rock formation (e.g. car and/or trail), don't fret, Hubbel will soon send you awry with an errant topo.Do yourself a favor and use one of the older guidebooks to this area (i.e. any one will suffice as all are superior to this one).It's only saving grace is a few of the areas documented are not available in any other guide. Caveat emptor!"
5,Everything you ever wanted to know about eBay...,"...but didn't know who to ask!I always knew there were better ways to take advantage of the potential bargains on eBay, but I didn't know what they were. And I had no idea who to ask.Julia Wilkinson's book is just the guide I needed to help me get the most out of eBay while wasting less time. She is a clear writer, and I've enjoyed her other books (her ebook, ""Best Bang for Your Book,"" on marketing a book was really helpful.)If you want to get more bang for your buck on eBay, and you have a life, you'll find this book helpful and fun to read."
5,I really like this book!,I found this book to be very nicely laid out and it is very easy to follow the instructions given. It is very user friendly. I think its a great eBay read!
2,Not needed to sell on e-bay,"This book did not really help me out for selling on e-bay. Unless you don't know one single little thing about e-bay, then this book is not worth it."
5,Worth a reread,"I have to admit that I almost put this book away 10+ times, but something made me stick with it. The abrupt changes between then and now require dedicated attention on the part of the reader, but unlike some other reviewers, as I neared the end I became more and more interested in the outcome. And the ending was a triumph! What a brilliant way to tie the ends together and finally explain all the unanswered questions from the chapters before. I will definitely reread this book with the final chapter in mind. Very nicely crafted book."
2,Disappointing,"I wanted to like this book. I was expecting something like a Barbara Erskine novel with great characters, time travel and bits of history and romance. What I got was a couple of self absorbed characters stuck in a decrepit house in a small village they weren't allowed to leave! Thank god I continued until the last few pages as there was a lovely twist to the end. Now I have to endure the next book to see how it pans out. I better not be disappointed!!!!"
4,Ferney,"A very enjoyable light read. Slightly unusual to the normal love triangle, a bit of a surprise ending. Have recommended it to friends, and would read again."
2,Interesting...until the very end,"I enjoyed reading this book until I reached the very end. I still cannot figure out what it meant. I love Barbara Erskine books and found this book very similiar. The buildup to the climax was enjoyable and I was interested throughout. The ending left me wondering what the ""twist"" really meant and I just cant ""get it""."
5,"The item was just what it said, just exactly what i wanted and arrived quickly, I couldn't ask for better service.","The item was just what it said, just exactly what i wanted and arrived quickly, I couldn't ask for better service."
2,Meh,"It does not fit very well. You have to gingerly place your phone otherwise the charger just slips out. i tried it on several phones. it works, but not well. It also charges much slower than the brand name version."
2,Decorative but not effective.,"Attractive display for thermometer, however first version purchased cracked during shipping. Replacement was received intact but registers a temperature that varies signficantly from the actual temperature."
5,Winner of prestigious Klinger Book Award,"I just want to let people know that At the Desert's Green Edge was awarded the Klinger Book Award by the Society for Economic Botany. This is according to an announcement in the members' publication for the San Diego Natural History Museum, where Dr. Rea is a research associate."
3,Operation Wandering Soul,"Extremely talented writers walk a fine line between loyalty to plot and characters and inspired word play. No one who reads this novel can deny Mr. Powers's intelligence or his talent. Nimble phrases and clever insights fairly lift off every page. However, this novel seems to be more about writing than about the characters cast adrift in the miasma of modern life. What might have been a satisfying mix of emotional engagement and brilliant writing remained an intellectual exercise for this reader. Impressive? Yes. Engaging? Unfortunately, no."
5,A must for h/s students even thinking about college!,"I first read this book in high school (in the mid '50's). I still haven't stopped laughing when I think about it. I want my h/s son to read it, since he's thinking about going to college soon. I think Asa's adventures would help him. Or, have I misspelled ""Asa's name."" I sure hope not. It's a great book, really, and are Shulman's others."
4,Aqua Lover,When i first heard the album version i thought it was cute and funny. Then i happened to find the mixes to it and i really enjoyed both sets of singles that i found. I did'nt even see the video until i bought the first single which had it on it. Even the video is cool Lene covers just about all the different types of barbie dolls that were out when the video was made! If you have'nt heard it yet by all means find the singles and buy them you won't be disappointed!
3,HIGHLY ENERGETIC!,"I find this cd very highly spirited; filled with energy and pumps you right up. The lyrics are hilarious! Aqua is pretty unique! I think track two is one of the best; and I absoloutly love the beat, forget about the lyrics...geez."
2,OK track,"The song is pretty catchy, but is poorly produced. You are better of buying the album, which isn`t good too, but you get more for you money."
1,"I hate Barbie Girl, I hate Barbie World","Life In Plastic.... who in their right mind could like a song like this, it is absolute rubbish. And as for Aqua, haven't they ever heard of writing different songs, every single one of their songs sounds exactly the same, except for Turn Back Time which was okay"
1,Should get 0 stars!,"This is quite possibly the worst song I have ever heard in my life. Sure, alot of bands just want to sell an album and don't care about the music, but this song is more than that. It's an insult to our intelligence! If it's possible to have a band that's worse than the spice girls, Aqua is it!"
1,Alvin and the Chipmunks on steroids!!,"Who ever said this song is great for kids should listen to the lyrics again! Yep. ""Undress me everywhere"" and ""you can touch, you can play"" definitely signifies a dirty song rather than a great kids singalong. Also, the high pitch singing in the song gave me a seizure. If you must own this song, get some dance track with only one version of this song, rather than four."
3,Flawed but informative,A biography of John Rae in more capable hands could have been a fantastic read. This is a mediocre presentation. Informative but annoyingly contrite and difficult to read unless you enjoy reading mattress pad labels.
5,SPEED's finaL aLbuM,"To those who have thoughts of buying this CD: the songs in it are really very nice! Especially track 01, 03, 07 and 11. It is quite different from their previous album, MOMENT, as it has more 'slow' songs in it. It surely worth ur $$, moreover its their final album.*take notice of Eriko's voice, in this CD, she sounds more mature than the previous*THUMBS UP!"
5,A Refreshing View of Lincoln,"When this book opened with a comparison of Abraham Lincoln to grape jelly (each a ubiquitous presence in American life), I wasn't sure what to expect. But I had never read anything by Jan Morris that wasn't well-written and unique. This little book on our greatest president is a gem. It is helpful to see ourselves as we are seen by non-Americans, so thank heavens Jan Morris, one of the greatest travel writers of all time, has graced us with numerous visits and reflections over her career."
1,This book is rubbish,"Giving 1 star is too much praise - I rate it 0 stars!I too started to read this book but gave up...I don't claim to be a ""Lincoln expert"" but the book is riddled with errors- almost too many to list.I can only repeat that it is rubbish."
1,More Telling About The Author,Ms. Morris' American animus is a leitmotiv throughout the book. The idea that Lincoln was gay is ludicrous. I've read several books on Lincoln from Vidal to Sandburg and this loose psychoanalysis from a smug Brit is not worth the paper it's written on.
1,Bitter Brit who can't get enough of attacking Lincoln,"I couldn't believe how often the author equated ""political correctness"" with defending Abe Lincoln! This author is one bitter Brit who doesn't appreciate the contribution the USA has made to the world.This book is for the dumpster."
1,Lincoln Assassinaated again by Jan Morris,"To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I expected an interesting book from a realistic perspective. This book was a GREAT EXAMPLE of the old adage of not judging a book by its cover. The cover was great on this book---it gave it character and substance. It was what the author wrote that was a HUGE disappointment. I only made it to about page 60. Yes there were errors in the book, but what I could not live with was the statements regarding Jan's explanation that Lincoln was Bisexual. This is simply nonsense. Jan should be writing for some grocery store rag not publishing books. My book is now exactly were this book should be........in the trash!"
3,lincoln with homosexual tendencies???,a late 1990's exploration and analysis of lincoln from the eyes and research of a british writer. why she includes grape jelly inthis book may be a clever writing tool but it was a more of a put-off than a lead-into the book. her reference to lincoln possibly having homosexual tendicies as a result of his awkwardness with women is an eye opener. some good stuff is how she reveals that lincoln was a little more cut throat than what history portrays him as and that is a refreshing peice of information because you had to always wonder if lincoln was a shrewd and cunning enough type of guy to maneuver thru the politicis of his day. obviously he was. also--where we learn that there may have been a northern backed assasination attempt on jefferson davis' life that failed but may have resulted in booth's vengeful inspiration to assasinate lincoln is very interesting. not a bad read really if you are open to a different viewpoint.
3,Uneven but sort of interesting,"Jan Morris' account of her quest for the ""real"" Lincoln takes her from cynical and irritated about how Lincoln is treated as an icon by the American public to her reluctant conclusion that there really was something remarkable about the man. As an American, I found her point of view interesting, her depiction of Americans condescending and her history not well researched. She makes some good comparisons (Lincoln's family of origin as being like ""white trash"") some wildly off base statements (Lincoln's religous statements may have been disingenuous) and I frankly found her personal travelog to be pretty much a bore. If you want to know about Lincoln there are dozens, probably hundreds, of more accurate books. If you want to know how the person of Lincoln still manages to seep through to even an unwilling investigator, this book has some interest."
4,Almost greatest!,"This is one cd and about 70 minutes long, so the individual mixes are long, but the cd itself is not mixed.Fairly typical zxy stuff, with some good opening vocals and nice for the first 7 songs, then it becomes more progressive/hardcore oriented. So, I felt it was a good effort, but a mixed bag. If you are able to get it cheaper such as about $5, then the investment is worth it."
2,"Nicely described, humanely built, kinda cheap to use","Sounds great, comes with a nice personalized, signed postcard from the people in India who made this. Made me feel great until I tried to play chess with my kids with this.Most wood chess sets come with weighted peices (so they don't fall over when you cough) and have felt-covered bases so they both slide and stick a little.This one doesn't. This one is very comparable to the $5 travel chess set you can buy anywhere in terms of useability. It may all be hand-made but the individual components are not weighted, not felt-based, have lathe-buds on the bases so they aren't even stable unless you sand them down yourself.This is a cheap set. If you want a nice wood chess set, aim for at least 21 inches, get weighted peices, plan to spend at least $75, as I've now done. Anyone want this one?"
2,Another Desert Dreamtime Journey Review,"I purchased this DVD based solely on the three reviews below.I can only assume the reviewers were watching on 25 inch or smaller analog sets. On my Toshiba 57HX81 HDTV, with Sony progressive scan DVD player the video quality was poor to say the least. Very grainy, and almost blurred at times, it came across to me like VHS tape resolution not DVD. The film is also full of dust specks scattered throughout the 77 minutes.What's even more disappointing is, it was shot in standard 4:3, not widescreen. A movie designed to show the majesty of the desert and they don't shoot widescreen?The audio quality is OK, but you only get Dolby Digital 2.0 not 5.1."
4,Just kept watching,Came across this on Fox Movie Channel. Caught my attention right away. Wife and I watched whole thing. Has some minor laps in logic. Still seems to hold your attention. Enjoyed it very much.
1,One of the worst movies ever!,"I can't believe Candice Bergen was in this movie...hello!!!! The acting was terrible, the plot was so..whatever. I believe we've been there and done this before. According to the synopsis, it should have been like a newer version of Misery. But it was NOT! Terrible acting by everyone. Please, leave this one on the shelf."
4,More than meets the eye,"It's hard to tell this from an on-line picture, but this sturdy little board book is made up of interestingly cut out pages layered on top of one another. The cut out object on one side of the page becomes a whole new item when you turn the page, and the pictures showing from behind the page turn out to be different than how they seemed on the page before. This is a very clever book for toddler exploration."
4,martin atkins on too many downers :),"COMPLETELY different from any other PIGFACE album, but that's the essence of PIGFACE. they are NEVER the same, ESPECIALLY live.i'll make this short (due to lack of sleep).if you want nightmares (nice ones), listen to TRAIN. it's 24 minutes of train tunnel like noise. bizarre, unruly, wicked, poisonous, and FRIGGIN AWESOME. lest i forget to mention, ORIGINAL? well, how much of PIGFACE isn't orignal? hahaha!anyways, KISS KING (high high high), NUTOPIA, and YOU KNOW/YOU KNOW/YOU KNOW are wickedly delicious songs.:warning: this music may cause intelligent, bizarre and/or random thoughts to occur. :)"
3,International Adoptions--Public Appearances,"This book describes how to tactfully deal with rude or simply ignorant people when they point out the obvious differences to a mixed race family through accounts of personal experiences, good and bad."
2,Faulty or Incomplete? Criterion Might Be Safer Bet,"WARNING: My copy of the ""(Enhanced)"" version, does not contain the entire film!!!Shortly after the Devil has compelled a nun to exit her office with a knife, the DVD abruptly ends! After some research (on youtube), I discovered that this act continues with the culmination of a dance frenzy at her convent, followed by the concluding act depicting the woes of a woman's psychosis. All said, the final 15 minutes of the film are missing.The DVD states it is 90 minutes long. The feature length of the film is supposed to be 105 minutes! There is no sign of these final acts in the chapter menu either.Whether a faulty DVD or an incomplete version of the film, you might do better purchasing the Criterion release instead."
2,Incomplete,"I was extremely excited to get my hands on this cult classic, however, I was highly upset when the movie cut off right in the middle of the 8th chapter. If this was a defect in the movie, it would have been nice to know this before going through the inconvenience of purchasing then returning the item. It't unfortunate, because I really wanted to see this movie simply because I have seen clips of the movie used in another classic, Maniac."
2,Odd curio for collectors only,"This feature packed DVD has everything fans of this film could want. The trouble is, how many fans are there? It is an odd silent movie about witchcraft. Some scenes are over the top. Many are just dull. I did find the commentary interesting. In fact, the commentary was more interesting than the movie. Only for silent collectors and hard core film historians."
2,ummm... yeah slightly amusing,"this is really just a live action (for most part) documentary about witchcraft and all, but in terms of entertainment, it's not that great, just slightly amusing."
3,bewitching witchcraft,"While not the best copy of this fascinating and controversial film, this video is the only one currently available. Benjamin Christensen's stunning compositions convey the horror and beauty of medievel devil lore and illustrate vividly the fear of witches throughout history. William s. Burroughs narrates in suitably somber tones. This Swedish production of Danish director Christensen best illustrates why he was revered for his visual style and later brought over to work in Hollywood. Let us hope that someone transfers a pristine print of this masterpiece to dvd soon!"
5,This movies has become a tradition,"Once a year, every spring, the ladies in our community have what is called Goddess Weekend. And each and every year we watch this movie. Granted, there are factual and sometimes uneasy parts of this film, but I just have to say that because it has become 'campy' it's quite entertaining for all. Even with the subtitles.... even better when someone reads them aloud, this movie is actually fun and the symbolism is just darn funny. For instance, in one part the 'devil'.... your basic horned ugly entity, has the witches lined up to kiss his butt. And the makeup on the priests is just down right scary! I have the vhs but plan to purchase this dvd even though it is a little pricey, it's worth it to me and my friends. If you are hesitant to purchase this, get a group together and try to rent it before you spend the money. This film is not for everyone and shows some really ugly old crones.One of my favorites!"
5,1989 World Series Battle Of The Bay,"This video is a fantastic video yearbook for both the SF Giants and Oakland A's and their amazing World Series Season that was disrupted by the San Francisco Bay Area Earthquake just prior to the start of Game 3. From the view as the biggest Will Clark and Rickey Henderson fan, there is lots of footage that adequately display their great talents and the impact they've had on their respective ball clubs. This video is a must have for any fan in the Bay area of either of these teams."
3,Not that good,"Just couldn't get along with it, tried it for a while but got annoyed by the ends curling up every time your sleeve catches the edges. It does a good job of protecting the Macbooks wrist pad which is prone to cracking on the front, but I have ordered the Moshi pad guard instead. Although the Moshi does not protect the keys from dust or spills it will protect the wrist pad from the cracking issue that all white Macbooks suffer. If you have this generation of Macbook I would urge you to get some protection for it, either this skin if you can tolerate it or the Moshi, as your precious Mac will eventually crack due to opening and closing."
1,Piece of junk!!!,Does not fit the keyboard flush. You will not be able to properly close your macbook. If you order from hightek toys it will take about a month to get to you. Just so you all know.
4,Great!,"fits like a glove, has kept hair out, dust, and other debris out of my keyboard, and has convinced people who use my laptop to buy one for theirs. It doesnt stick, but as long as you're aware of it being there, it wont slide off or fall out."
1,bait and switch,Looked all these over ordered one that was made by i think Razpro i had seen my daughters made by them and liked it supposedly thats what this one was suppose to be came in differant very cheap made differant brand tryed to use it but it was junk just thru it away and went on until yall asked me to reveiw it
3,It works,"This cover is excellent for keeping my Macbook clean - no crumbs/dust in the keyboard or stains on either side of the touchpad. It's a thin, white, transluscent layer of silicone that fits quite precisely over the keyboard and area below. The touchpad is left exposed, but the part you click is covered. Two complaints: 1. The cover is not at all attached to the computer - there's a little cling/traction that prevents it sliding when in use, but I often accidentally lift off the sides; 2. I lose a lot of typing sensitivity and find myself pressing extra hard on the buttons just to ensure that I haven't missed any letters.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this item if keeping your Macbook nice and new is important to you. But if you don't have much patience for clumsier typing and unsecured accesories, you should probably stay away."
3,"Mediocre, I suppose.","I ordered this item thinking it would be pretty good having 4 1/2 stars and all, but it's not really all that great in my opinion. I haven't had it for all that long, so I guess it's no surprise that it's not very dirty, but my main issue is the way it fits on my Macbook. It fits pretty loosely, so I'm frequently having to adjust the edges, pulling or tugging it into place because it moves. It also moves pretty much every time I open it. Other than the fitting issue, I guess it's alright. But I think I might just resort back to using alcohol wipes to keep my keys and palm rests clean."
1,Try something else,"I purchased a bed like this a year ago and it was great. So a little over a month ago, I purchased another one. HORRIBLE! It's like a feather pillow. It's suppose to expand to 10"" or more - it doesn't. I contacted the manufacturer - sent one back and got another one. The second one was just as bad. By then I had over $25 in shipping costs - not to mention time and packing materials - so I just gave up."
4,great big doggie bed,"I bought this for my mastiff puppy when he came home at 7 weeks and 12-lbs... he's now 10 months and 155-lbs and still loves his bed! The outer cover did only OK in the washer, it tore a bit at the seams - but the design is what I love about it! It stays mostly out of the way but is still big and comfy enough for my big beasty, there's no other doggie bed out there that he'd still be comfy on and I'd have room for - it's the perfect combo of size and space efficiency."
4,Excellent,"Very clear, unedited action. Disc 1 has the entire death match tourney, including pre-match announcements and locker room interviews. Disc 2 has several hardcore matches from XPW, of which I have never really been a fan. If disc 2 had contained more Japanese death matches, this purchase would have gotten 5 stars, easily."
2,Doesn't fit roland speakers,"Another reviewer mentioned they fit Roland speaker DS-90A. They don't and unfortunately after trying to make them work, I cannot return them."
5,Well made,"Very well made. Just make sure to shop around local stores to get the best value. I got it onsale on Amazon and with a special coupon. Price was close to similiar products at Lowes, Home Depot, or ACE. This as a bit more(I spent about 50 cents more), but the quality is much better than what I found at my local box stores. So I was happy with the purchase."
3,mostly a play item,Bought for my 8 yr old daughter and within a few days the light bulb went out and theres no way to replace it. I have checked every website associated with Bratz and no results. She still uses the mirror but its not the same.
3,Bond Spoof and Origins,Charles Feldman's Casino Royale is a colorful psychedelic mess 36 years after its creation. This film was the first James Bond spoof and a precurser of the Austin Powers movies. Unfortunately the film has not aged well.The jokes seem as dated as the costumes. There is virtually no plot to speak of and the sequences by four directors seem cobbled together by fifth director Val Guest.The film is fun to watch with its great musical score and vibrant colors but there isn't a lot holding this thing together.Perhaps the most interesting feature of the disc is the 1954 TV movie from Climax Mystery Theatre which featured Barry Nelson as the American spy Jimmy Bond. It was fun to see the true origin of the Bond franchise.Bottom line rent it for its place in history but don't go in expecting greatness.
2,How Such Things Came to Be,"After a mercifully unviewed version appeared on CBS in the early 1950's, Ian Fleming sold the film rights to actor/director/producer Gregory Ratoff. Nothing ever came of it and Ratoff died owning the rights. It later passed to former agent Charlie Feldman. When Feldman could not obtain the services of Sean Connery (still under contract to Cubby Broccoli & Harry Saltzman), he decided to make a spoof instead. His instructions to Terry Southern and the other writers was to ""throw out the plot"" -- inwhich they thoroughly succeeded. Large cast of well known actors, several different directors and an imprehensible waste of time -- even with Woody Allen, Peter Sellers and Orson Welles. For a completist only. If you want a spoof watch Derek Flint, Matt Helm or Austin Powers."
2,1960s Train Wreck,"I think part of the attraction of this movie is its distinctive Sixties elements. So psychedelic, so mod, such intrigue. The music and clothes and sexy women.But CASINO ROYALE is a disaster as a film and a comedy. It's AUSTIN POWERS without the laughs.It's such a disaster that the star, the emotionally-disturbed Peter Sellers, walked off the movie and they never stopped the production. (Depending on which books you read, Sellers walked off either after his dead mother visited him in a dream to tell him to, or when Orson Welles mistook him for Woody Allen at an elevator and he ran off in a huff).David Niven is then forced to carry on the chaos as it noisily crashes to its climax, the kind of madness that would be much better used in BLAZING SADDLES seven years later.There are moments, but very few. Woody Allen's part at the end at last hits on the zaniness that should've been there from the start.Only for pure Sixties nuts."
3,Psychedelic Happening on Film,"Casino Royale came out at the height of the Summer of Love era. It's an artifact of that time in many regards, including the production design, the camera angles, the weird effects and the array of actors wafting through the film. Helmed by too many directors, Val Guest (according to a interview I saw with him) did most of the shooting after the muddled production drove away the other directors and most importantly Peter Sellers. Uneven, sure, but there are bright moments in the film too. For me, the absolute highlight is Burt Bacharach's music, including the great theme and ""The Look of Love."" Still, the this version of Casino Royale is fun and a document of the time. It's not erased by the more recent remake, but stands in contrast to the typical Bond films. Interestingly, after Casino Royale, the Bond films, especially with Roger Moore, took a less serious approach, and were almost self-parody. But Casino Royale is a real parody."
3,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 24",**1/2. I certainly missed a lot of references to the James Bond films shot before Casino Royale but I liked the homage toThe Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Edition)and to the German expressionist films of the 20's in the Berlin scene. Good entertaining value for a film that hopefully allowed John Huston to pay his taxes. Deborah Kerr is also great as the nymphomaniac Lady Fiona McTarry. Recommended.
2,Ill-Fated 007 Spoof With Few Laughs,"Originally intended as a Peter Sellers vehicle, ""Casino Royale"" (1967) became something radically different when the mercurial comic actor abandoned the project before its completion. Rather than throw in the towel, producer Charles Feldman threw away more millions to salvage the unsalvageable. Hence the multiple directors and numerous guest stars filling in the gaps left by Sellers' departure. The result is an extravagant mess. Sellers provides the best moments in this ill-fated 007 spoof - highlighted by the baccarat sequence with Orson Welles."
1,Buy the sound track instead,"It's a star-studded cast, but the story line lags badly in several places leaving the viewer wondering when the movie will finally end. The sound track is a classic one featuring many of the premier musical performers of the middle to late 1960's. I would buy the sound track rather than the film if I were you, which is also available through Amazon.com"
2,What can one say???,"What can one say about this complete & utter mess of a movie. I was waiting for a good laugh, very few and far between. Yes I too noticed lots similar to the Austin movies, aleast they had a story line and a lot of laughs. I guess this movie made in the sixties explains why it is what it is. Too much of something they were on back then. After reading some reviews on Casino Royale I really expected more of a laugh than what I got. sorry, this one is not for me."
1,Sony should burn this movie,"Multiple Bonds! A Bond scared of women. Ya ya ya, this Bond is an Austin Powers one... yech... I find it unfunny... I could not wait for it to end. By the way at least the Barry Nilson one is much better.Oh yes Sony, please dont bundle this flim with the Daniel Craig one in a special edition in the future. Sony, please burn this movie."
3,rent it i guess.,"the movie starts off well with it's humor, but you eventually find yourself lost as the plot branches out. there were plenty of scenes that really had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. what i really got out of the film was that peter sellers was the only one keep ing the movie together. there's too much humor that is just dated now. atleast rent to see peter sellers."
2,"Somewhat entertaining, mostly dull","Casino Royale isn't a terrible movie; it has its moments, and, truly, has a superb cast. That much can be said for it. There are some scenes with Ursula Andress, especially, that are very funny, and the beginning isn't without its humor. However, in general it is a mess of movie; loosely constructed, making little to no sense, and, what is worst of all, not even all that funny. I had to fight off sleep to keep consciousness during the movie, something I almost never have to do. I actually got to the point where I couldn't wait for it to end. Not the worst film ever made, but save your money. Rent it if you must."
1,So bad that its not even laughably good.,"The jokes aren't funny and the plot doesnt make much sense but there are tons of ""A list"" stars in this terrible Bond spoof.Not really watchable even for the fun of it.The soundtrack however is one of the best ever.Bond fan or not...it was awful then and still is."
1,trash,"The unfunniest comedy ever made. Might have worked as a 89 minute film...but at two hours plus...ouch ouch ouch. You will laugh at the 4 or 5 minutes in which Woody Allen stars, otherwise this is a piece of trash. Save your time..save your money."
1,Casino Un-Royale,"Spend your money on popcorn, not this film. The story is poor at best, acting is so-so, and the theme is awful. Sellers and Niven are much better actors than portrayed here. This is a horrible movie. Nothing to do with a ""007 James Bond"" type film at all. Very disappointing."
4,casino royale,I know that this is the original casino royale but I really prefer the newer one with Daniel Craig in it.
4,The Real James Bond,"I have always loved the original Casino Royale... Peter Sellers is wonderful in this movie, as is everyone else. Image is fairly good for a mid/late 60's production, and Hughes does a wonderful job of directing this epic."
3,Casino Royale - NOT the real one!,"Well worth the purchase and is a zany addition to any Bond fan's film collection, despite it being outside the franchise. The extras are extensive & informative and the movie itself has many fascinatiing moments even though it disintegrates into mayhem in the final quarter.I'd still recommend it as fascinating & amusing Bond paraphernalia."
2,Don't Pay Too Much For This,"I knew this was a spoof, but I bought it anyway since I'm a huge Bond fan. I really didn't see much humour in this at all, and I'm not sure how people back in the 60's did either. If you like silly spy spoofs, get the Matt Helm collection with Dean Martin."
3,"Classic Bacharach/Dusty Springfield music, so-so film","Burt Bacharach's score for Casino Royale and Dusty Springfield's classic breathy version of the Look of Love, came to define something about the late 60s. In fact, the LP of this movie is considered one of the standard audiophile discs used to test high-end audio systems. It has something to do with the quality of the recording equipment used at the time.BUT.... If you are renting/buying this disc in hopes of a James Bond film, you will be disappointed. More a spoof than anything else, the movie doesn't really work on that level. David Niven, Woody Allen and the rest of the cast are fun to watch in some spots. But overall, it's a barely passable film. But that score! Even the opening number by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass will jolt you out of your chair.Classic Records released a DVD audio version of the soundtrack. It's also available on regular CD."
4,Peter Sellers = Austin Powers,"I watched this movie for the first time in years last night. Great for all the stars, the ""swinging sixties"" atmosphere and the great music(made me think of my late grandparents and their Herb Albert albums!) I'm glad I read the other reviews about Sellers walking out and all the production problems--that explains alot about the plot problems and why Sellers character was killed off before the conclusion. Still a really fun film I enjoyed as much now as 25 years ago. After watching Peter Sellers performance I have no doubt Mike Myers thought the same. When Sellers(with his nerdy/hip looks and thick black glasses)took off his shirt and exposed his hairy back all I could think of was Austin Powers! + The scene in the first Austin Powers with Bacharach's ""The look of Love"" was lifted staight out of this movie. Obviously a big influence. GREAT FUN. I WOULD BUY A COPY"
4,Bond with a hand buzzer,"This is by no means the typical Bond, James Bond movie. Even though it is only in name the same as an Ian Fleming book, it is a zany comedy. It is an absolute riot to watch. The cast includes such notables as David Niven, Peter Sellers, and Woody Allen. Fans of the off the wall comedies of the Sixties and Seventies should love it. In fact fans of the Austin Powers movies should enjoy it too. A nice mixture of comedy and action. Will the real James Bond please stand up? Good quality DVD but nothing special about extras. Well worth the price. A must have for any fan of the James Bond movies."
4,Funny Good,"This is a good movie that I found funny. If you love James Bond 007, you'll love this off handed version."
4,"Funny, but not Bond","Since Casino Royale was not definitely going to be a real James Bond movie, and the makers understood that, they evidently decided to compensate by having so many Bonds in the movie that they made up for it. LOL If you watch this dieing to see a Bond movie, you'll of course be utterly disappointed.If you watch it with the expectation of seeing a 60s zany-style comedy, it delivers in spades.The theme song is just too cool. Herb Alpert at his best.And for a 60s flick, its pretty sexy as well.""Have no fear ... Bond is here""."
4,Another fun 60's flick,I think you had to be a late teenager or early 20's and have gone to drive in movies to appreciate these types of movies. They were fun. Not to be academy awards winners. Just silly fun. Music is great and worth getting the movie just for the music
3,The Original Austin Powers,"This movie is akin to Austin Powers in that it satirizes the James Bond spy movie of the 60s. But it is (probably unintentionally) a satire of that whole 60s ""hip"" ""swinging"" pop culture since its actually from that period. There are some interesting cultural and cinematic references (like the expressionist inspired scene set in Berlin). Mildly funny, but a good period piece."
3,James Bond is back...,"I first saw Casino Royale when I was 7 years old. (Wow!) This was the film which caused me to fall in love with Joanna Pettit and believe that someone other than Sean Connery could be a credible Bond. The highlight of the film is the opening score featuring the horn of the late Al Hirt. That's not to say that the film doesn't have it's moments. Various conventions and mores of the time are parodied, some rather hysterically, and Woody ""sleeper"" Allen and Orson ""Citizen Kane"" Welles are quite good in their roles. When veiwing Casino, this has to be done from the perspective of the ""swinging 1960's."" If taken with a piece of good 'n' fruity candy and tongue against cheek, the film is quite enjoyable."
3,When Your Brain Needs a Break,"This is a movie for when you want to give your brain a break and just sit back and laugh. Shallow plot, skimpy special effects, and just dumb humor."
2,Uggh,"My parents took me to see this when it was in the cinemas in 1967. We were expecting an actual BOND movie, with suspense, etc. And then we ended up watching this poor attempt at slapstick satire. It's ""What's New Pussycat"" warmed over. (And I don't even like ""What's New Pussycat,"" even though Peter O'Toole is my favorite actor.) I will say Herb Albert's theme song is brilliant, and almost worth the price of the video, alone. I love that theme song!!"
2,Rubbish!,"British comedy of the 1960s is pretty cheesy at the best of times, think 'Carry On...' but this one, Casono Royale, is just mindless pap. Sellers, Niven, Wells and Andress do nothing to uplift this trash for me. And oh dear, as that Woody Allen? It's so awful, it makes Austin Powers look GOOD! Long, overplayed sequences and gags so devoid of humour, they sound as though they were lifted directly out of 'The Goon Show.' But there is one redeeming feature, hence the two stars for my review: I love the theme tune! I'd buy that on MP3 but leave the movie well alone, and go and watch the new version instead!"
1,No wonder it doesn't have a sequel!!!,"If a James Bond novel is to be butchered in a spoof, 007 should not be an older fellow.One highlight:Bond has a nephew!"
