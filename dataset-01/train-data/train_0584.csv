1,I hate Ja's New Album,This album sucks cause it is not original and cool like venni vetti vecci wich is like one of the greats forget this one and buy limp's new album much better than this piece of crap.
3,It is too long,"A potentially decent film which is just dragged out with endless episodes of the ""hero"" getting chased, kidnappe, shot at, tortured (mildly), etc. Then about 20 minutes before the end it becomes rather clear what's going to be the answer for one of the questions in the film. Other questions either are not that interesting to find the answers to or are not really answered, though implied. The latter wouldn't be bad except that the answers don't seem to lead to anything relevant as the movie ends focusing on the earlier ""exposed"" answer. Yeah...I don't want toruin it for anyone by giving the ending points away, but at least 90 minutes of this long film are, as I note, a repetitive series of chasing around with no real advancement of the plot. So I give it a three for the other 90 minutes which is okay, though I would not watch it again."
3,Cerebral hijinks,"Death by Unches' characters are reminiscent of Miss Marple and Monsieur Poirot, and its clever plot will delight the avid puzzler."
1,"Nice pattern, but not as functional as I'd like...",I bought this for my newborn a few months ago. I don't like that the outer layer and inner layer are not attached to each other except at the edges. This makes drying a wriggly baby a bit more difficult because you move one layer and the other doesn't move with it. I've settled on the one layer thin hooded towels (BabiesRUs/Target varieties). The thin towels make it easier to dry in all those little creases.
1,SENSELESS,"Clive Barker produced but did not write THE PLAGUE...but what a stinko movie.All the kids in the world under the age of 9 go into some kind of vegetative state; ten years later they awaken and start killing people. Why? We are never told..and the ending is the biggest copout of all.DAWSON CREEK's James van der Beek frowns throughout the movie, and Ivana Milocevic just looks bored; the movie makes no sense whatsoever, so don't waste your time like I did!"
2,Plot...what plot,"While the concept of the movie is interesting the follow through of the plot leaves much to be desired. The plague itself was interesting but the reasoning behind it was a little farfetched. As far as I understand it the children of the world (below a certain age) fall into a coma, and the only reasoning is that as a collective decided not to live in our barbaric world. Please....I could've made a better explaination. Try this on for size: Aliens were trying to take over through the use of younger generations, because something about their nature prohibits actual aggression. In reagards to the movie don't waste your time."
2,"Shake, Rattle, And Roll...","In THE PLAGUE, all children under ten years old are plunged into mysterious comas. They remain in this state for ten years, only moving when they all (simultaneously) enter seizures. Of course, the kids (now teens) wake up, and seek to rid the planet of those pesky old folks. The problem w/ this movie is not in its premise, but in the execution thereof. As killer kid movies go, PLAGUE is unpardonably slow, dull, and non-terrifying. I kept waiting for the thrills / chills to begin, only to have all hopes dashed. The kids themselves are devoid of any real creepiness. They look just as bored as I was watching this donkey log!..."
3,an average Zombie flick,"The movie looks and feels like a 70s horror movie. I detected no cgi. If you like Zombie flicks, this one will not disappoint. I like where the movie explores the friction of the young vs the old generation as it grows stronger over the years in our world."
3,Cute for older Jewish adults,"References to competing Bar Mitzvah efforts. Who can think of the most expensive, creative affairs. You have to be Jewish ro really appreciate this although Darryl Hannah is a nice distraction. I loved it (age 75) but my children and grandchildren were not impressed."
1,"Don't waste your money - stupid, boring movie.","Thought the subject matter would result in a funny movie - not the case. Stupid, strained humor. Turned it off after 45 minutes becasue I figured it would be more entertaining to watch paint dry.Save your money - don't bother buying this movie!"
2,Daryl Hannah Is the Only Thing that Keeps it Going,"This movie was enjoyable at times, but without Daryl Hannah's comic relief, it wouldn't have been halfway decent. The fact that there needs to be comic relief in a comedy certainly says something about the film...I also agree with the reviews in that the grandfather character takes over the film, resulting in way too many ""jokes"" that aren't funny at all. However, if you're coming to see Daryl Hannah, I suggest this film 100% because she is just hilarious. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
4,A cute family movie,"Calling a movie nice, clean, and wholesome may be the death of Hollywood blockbusters, but then this movie is not exactly a blockbuster. Which is a good thing. This is a good heart-warming movie for the whole family. Some viewers may not be able to relate to the theme of a young man's Bar Mitzvah, but this is only the vehicle used to carry the story, and it makes for good comedy. I loved the scene where the young man is looking into the mirror, trying to reassure himself by repeating ""Today I am a man. Today I am a man"", and then brushing his teeth with a Sponge Bob tooth brush. Not exactly great theater, but great fun and lots of moments that make you laugh and smile.This is how life is. We all look into the mirror from time to time and try to reassure ourselves. The story of the search for what is truly important in life is an old one, but one that needs re-telling each generation."
2,"Preschooler loves it, but it's not this parent's favorite","Although my daughter loves this book, I was a little disappointed to find that the plot of this book is a competition between Emily E and her new neighbor, to see who has the best dog. Of course, each girl concludes that her dog is best.The book does show how competitive comparisons can be damaging, but along the way it may leave the wrong impression on your child."
3,A good childrens book,"When I was young I would sit down and read this book. I always loved it however the book I have is a little different. The Title, and story are the same but I have a book that is mostly black and white with few colors. It's in a small rectangular shape, and has no copy right date. It's very interesting. However this is a cute book for any child, and has good illustrations that would grab any kids attention."
4,"High paced action, but short of perfection","This movie, when I saw it, had everything and then lost some part. There wasn't much depth to the story and it was a little meaningless, but as always, his high-flying stunts are excellent. It could have been perfect if story was tuned up a bit, though."
4,Quality Jackie,This was good Jackie. Some incredible fast paced action scenes and a cheesy plot that you just have to laugh at. The fighting is some of Jackie's best and this is a much better buy then Rumble in the Bronx or Supercop.
5,Jackie Chan does it again,"This movie has one of the most amazing fight scenes that I have ever seen. As Jackie fights thugs in a construction yard, everyday construction objects such as cement mixers, wheelbarrows, and boards become deadly weapons in his hands. There is a lot of humor thrown in and some great special effects. The only disappointing part is that the ending is somewhat cheesy. The movie ends by a means other than Chan's own lightning-fast hands. Other than that, Mr. Nice Guy was a great movie and I definately recommend buying it."
4,Worth it just to see Chan almost get buzzsawed.,"This isn't Chan's best film, but he's made so many, that's not really saying anything. Nearly every film he's ever made is worth seeing if only to enjoy his acrobatic madness.The plot for Mr. Nice Guy would fill a postage stamp, but who watches these for plot? They're always just a thinly veiled excuse for some brilliant action sequences. And this movie is full of them. They're not exceptionally creative by Chan's standards, but they're still lovingly executed and a joy to behold. I just wish there was one last fight instead of the dumptruck ending, though it is kind of cool to watch stuff getting crushed."
3,Not up to scratch,"I expected better things of this movie after seeing the preview. Jackie might have said that it was good to have his old friend Samo Hung direct this movie but it sufferred badly from being a low budget movie. Judging from the scenery this was filmed in Melbourne, Australia using local actors and it shows. It seems to lack the atmosphere of his Hong Kong films and the glitz and polish of his Hollywood adventures. You only have to compare this movie with 'Who Am I' which was made more or less around the same time to see the difference. Maybe it was Samo - I don't know. If you're looking for a first time Jackie, non-Hong Kong movie you can always go with 'Rumble in the Bronx' or maybe 'First Strike' but not this one."
4,"Good stunts, funny momments","Not one of his best, but certainly one of his funniest. Mr Nice guy is a good JC time killer since it is full of plenty of high kicking and funny one-liners (An example is when Jackie hides in a Chinese vendor's ice cream truck. When one of the gangsters approches he has the vendor if he's see a chinese man around the park, and the vendor responds ""Yeah. Me.""). Another funny momment is the cameo of Sammo Hung as a cycling pedestrian who sticks his nose in the van where Jackie is getting beaten up. As usual, the stunts (like the cool horse carriage scene) take precedence over the plot (TV Chef gets caught up in gang fight). Also, the actors play second bannana to JC's performance (Richard Norton has the most notable credentials, while Vince Paletto was on All My Children for a brief time). That doesn't matter since it still is entertaining, but I would take Police Story or First Strike over this."
4,Not bad but could have been better,"This movie was a decent Jackie Chan film but with all of the bad actors it made it uneasy to watch. Also the American version has been butchered with a few scenes deleted and some moved around. The bad thing about New Line's version is that they took out the theme song at the end with Jackie singing it. If you can get your hands on a Golden Harvest imported version then get it cause it's a lot better than the New Line U.S. release. If you want to get one of the newer Chan flicks then go with ""Who Am I?"" because it's much better than this one."
2,"Jackie rules....this movie, however, is awful.","Jackie Chan is one of the most talented people working in entertainment today, and probably the greatest action star ever. Mr. Nice Guy however, is a horrible movie. Combine a cheesy and absurd script with 90% brain-dead actors and you get Mr. Nice Guy. The only thing that saves this is a few cool stunts and fights, although there is nothing here that would make any of his Hong Kong films look outclassed in the least. Also notable is a humorous cameo with the director, Samo Hung, who is also Jackie's lifetime friend. If you want to see some of Jackie's great work, check out Police Story, Drunken Master 2, Project A or Armor Of God 2 (AKA Operation Condor). Unless your a serious Jackie fan, don't bother with this."
2,Jesus Christ they kidnapped Kenny,"Jackie's Girlfriend is Kidnapped ONE MORE TIME, and he rescues her ONE MORE TIME. Jackie's Chinese Movies are lot funnier than his English ones. My favorite is Police Story Part III(three) which is not available on Amazon."
1,"Jackie Chan Brilliant, everything else garbage","I am ashamed that this got out of Australia, Jackie Chan and his fight scenes is the only good thing about the movie. Very low buget with the uniformed police that look like the keystone cops to the cardboard security fences and actors that can't act (except for Jackie). Lets face it people Mr Nice Guy is just crap."
1,Unknown,I don't remember ever purchasing this from Amazon. But if I did-it is not my style of movies. I don't have it in my collection of DVD's.
3,"Stunts are fine, but in real fights people get hurt","Moving from Hong Kong to Melbourne Jackie Chan continueshis dance routines. Choreography seems to be the method in his movies.He can probably disable somebody with one punch ( if he wanted to).But action, comedy and gangsters make people pay to see these.For me this is a boring kind of film. Jackie Chan is a master of bobbing and weaving, but must have scars to prove you can't always get the stunts right.He does seem like Mr. Nice Guy."
3,Not Jackie's best movie,"So, why is this tv chef such a tough guy anyway? I enjoyed this movie, but the plot wasn't that interesting, and none of the bad guys seemed to be all that tough, so the fights were just all Jackie. Even with Jackie's hands and legs tied, the big boss presents no challenge to Jackie. Stunts were okay, like Jackie hanging from a doorknob at a construction site. Overall, though, this movie doesn't have anything that would make me say it was anywhere near his best movie."
3,mr boring movie,"I think this is one of Jackie Chan's lesser movies. If you really want to see a cool movie with Jackie and Richard Norton, check out City Hunter! I suppose this has a few good stunts, but compared to what we know he can put out this movie is pretty dull. Richard Norton is cast as a wimp, which he is not. Go for something else."
3,"Good, but not up to his usuall standards.","The plot of this movie (as with most of them) is simple and easy to follow, although is sometimes veiwed as stupid. Jackie has some good fights and stunts (as with most of his movies), but some action scenes are spoilt by the bitty slow motion they are veiwed in. In spite of this, this movie is entertaining and good fun, worth a rent, and maybe a buy if you are a fan."
2,Brown spot night cream,"I have not been using this as long as a month, which is what it suggests. I can't see that it will do anything for brown spots that must penetrate through several layers of your skin. IF it was a particularly nice feeling or pleasant scent hand cream I would say try it if the price is right. But, it is neither so I wouldn't buy it again.I will continue to apply it since I have it and will update this review if my findings are any different."
2,Not sure,"I have been using this cream on my face for 4 weeks and have not noticed any change. I recently started to use it on my arms for sunspots and will see how that works, but it doesn't seem to be anything more than just a night cream."
3,Still there,"After six weeks the brown spots are still there, but all the skin around them is lighter...hmmmmWorked better to even out overall tone of skin at the neck line."
3,Works okay...,Cream absorbs nicely and feels fine....but I have noticed very little difference in my brown spots. It's been about 3 weeks...maybe it needs more time...we'll see...
2,Not impressed.,"Can see no difference after 4 weeks of use and I am using the day cream also. Wish I could give a rave review like some of the other reviewers, but can't."
4,Translate,"Every floating object should have this manual on board, sail and power. Why not translate it to a few languages from cultures with a lot of sailors? (German,Dutch, French, Spanish,etc.)"
5,The bible for cruisers,"This is the second copy of this book I have ordered; the first was for our own boat just before we left on a year-long cruise, and the second copy more recently for a friend who intends to sail around the world. It helped us many times with many different repairs and it helped the friend on day two when he had an engine problem. I consider it essential for any sailor who must be self-sufficient.by Nadine Slavinski, author of ""Lesson Plans Ahoy! Hands-on learning for sailing children and home schooling sailors"" (148 pages; available on Amazon.com).Lesson Plans Ahoy!: Hands-on learning for sailing children and home schooling sailors"
3,Lacks gasoline engine info,"good on basics except fails to help those of us looking for information on older, or actually any, gasoline engines. And that is not mentioned in any of the advertisements or other information. I should return it."
5,Just what my husband wanted!,"Bought this for my husband for his birthday! He really wanted this book, so I was happy when I found it on Amazon.com! It shipped in a few days and arrived in perfect shape! Couldn't ask for more! I am sure it will come in very handy when we use our boat next summer!"
5,A must have,Every boat owner who plans on doing work on their boat should have a copy of this book. You will be able to do the work correctly the first time and fix what was done before you. Just an incredible reference.
5,Electrical System Design,"I'm redesigning the electrical system for my boat and portions of this book has given me the knowledge to make informed decisions, with an understanding of the trade offs, about what features and capabilities I would like my new system to have. It has also provided information to allow me to make intelligent decisions about selecting new components to achieve my electrical system goals efficiently (save money by not buying things I don't need). I would recommend this book for the person with a basic knowledge of electricity who wants to understand either how their current electrical system works or how they might change it to make it better."
5,The Essential Boat Maintenance Manual Has Gotten Even Better!!,"The third edition of Nigel Calders' seminal work has improved even more proving that this is still THE book for the expert or novice. Nigel's easy style is akin to have a quiet conversation with an expert. The text is clear and concise and the photos and illustrations ensure that the reader will gain a thorough grasp of the subject material.If you own a boat, power or sail, that has any electrical, mechanical or plumbing system onboard, then you need this book."
1,Irrelevant book,"This is not a book for boatowners, unless you own a megayacht, or a tugboat.Calder seems not to realize most boats are powered by gas engines. He doesn't mention them at all in his book. There's a long, detailed chapter on diesel engines. But NOTHING on gas engines!He also doesn't cover sterndrives. He does deal with inboards extensively. But, again, many, many boats are propelled by sterndrives. Other than a small photo, he ignores them. How a book on mechanical systems can ignore mechanical systems is a small oversight, I guess.Winterizing? Forget it. With no mention of gas engines, he can't begin to touch on proper winterizing.I sent my book back. It's a waste of money for most boat owners."
5,Only the Bible is more important if you own a boat,"Kudos to the author. Best book, I saved thousands on repairs. Though I no longer own a boat, the electrical stuff covers my RV!Get it, you won't be sorry."
2,"Good for large boats, not small fishing boats.","I have a 17"" fishing boat with an outboard motor. It's a good informative books, but not for outboard motors. This book is for big inboard boats like yahts and sailboats with complex electrical wiring ann inboard motors."
4,More than I expected,This Manual covered what I needed and beyond. Good shop book for the DYI mariner. Shows how and tells why for many marine repairs.
5,"""The Book"" on boats.","There's no better. 'nuff said.A comprehensive guide to these essential aspects to safe and enjoyable boating, Calder explains in an easy to understand voice that shows deeps experience and little reverence for many boat builder's practices.New or old boat, you need to read Calder to keep yourself, your boat and your crew safe."
2,Too Much Info is Sometimes Not Helpful,Do you really need to know the history of the battery? Just one poor example of how detailed this author is. I want info on how to fix the problem with good illustrations (these are poor) and short steps to find the problem and then to fix it.I would not waste my time on this purchase.
5,excellent,"I am a student at a well-known school of boat building in Maine. This is one of the texts we use in our Marine Systems Technology course. It is very thorough, detailed and one can understand what the author is trying to say. I just gave a copy to my father-in-law who keeps his boat on Buzzards Bay. I think the owner of every recreational yacht should have one, if only to understand what the guys at the yard are talking about when discussing the systems on the boat."
2,TOO TECHNICAL!,"I was disappointed, the book would be great for a Boat Technician, but for the average lay person, it didn't give you the necessary insight to fix or maintain your boat."
5,So far so good!,I highly recommend this Bynford stapler. Lumber Liquidators carry a very popular line of solid hardwood flooring that are in 5/16th thickness. This tool work really good with those floors. The tool has a heavy duty feel and probably is adequate for commercial purposes. In fact it is much more stout than the Porter Cable nail guns I own. I choose this model over an adjustable $179.00 Bostik model due to the cost and have zero regrets so far. So far I've install about 300/1000 sq ft in my project and have had one jam-up. My only suggest would be to give the base a little bigger footprint but it works fine as is.
5,Worked wonderfully,"The Hubby and I bought 5/16 Brazilian Walnut and we installed it ourselves. This stapler worked really well. One problem is that the angle of the stapler does not allow you to staple the last 3 or so rows. We had to glue those. Also, it did not have enough power to go through the face of the wood, only the tongue (we thought we would be able to staple through the top for the last couple of rows in our closets and fill the dents in with wood putty but that was not possible). The fact is that we are both novices and our issues with this stapler might be issues that occur with all staplers.Overall, this tool was effective and easy to use and I highly recommend it. We also purchased the recommended staples from Amazon and we had no problems with them either."
4,Great Flooring tool,"Was sceptical about purchasing this gun, Not being a name brand but am very happy with purchase. Have shot 7500 staples so far and it jammed twice. Pretty good average I guess. I recomend this for the DIYer but wouldn't suggest for comercial work."
5,Great buy for the price!,"This flooring stapler is a great buy! I did not want to rent one, since I only have about 3 hours a day to do my home improvements and I did not want to spend a couple hundred for one. I did a 144 sq ft room with no problems from this tool!! My only suggustion is to make sure your local hardware store has the staples in stock. I had to go to 4 local home improvement stores to find the staples. This a great buy!! I very pleased I bought this staple gun."
3,Bynford floor stapler,"I am installing engineered hard wood flooring. The biggest issue is the staples not being set all the way into the wood.I have the air pressure set above 100lbs. Maybe it is because i am not using the recommended staples. i had a box of Senco 3/16, 19 gauge 1 inch staples and did not want to spend money on staples. I am thinking trying the recommended staples to see if that makes a difference. otherwise the stapler operates with no jam ups and is quality made."
3,Disney doing it again.,"The very first Baby Einsteins were the best. This is pre-Disney. Now that Disney owns the rights, there has been alot of computer graphics and over stimulation that the original movies did not have. I will not be buying any more of these because of repetition and because they are losing the quality that made them great."
4,Very Cute,"This is a cute DVD; I like it better than other Baby Einstein's. My 1-year old is still a little too busy to watch TV for long, which I guess is a good thing, so it doesn't interest her too much yet. We'll keep it ready for when she calms down a bit!"
5,Great for my 8 month old,My son received this DVD for Christmas. He will sit and watch nearly the whole thing. He loves the puppets and babies. Great gift!
2,My Least Favorite Baby Einstein,"My daughter loves the Baby Einstein DVD's, so I got this one for her for Christmas. Compared to the other ones, it's a bit slow and boring. I thought there would be more fun movement shown (such as dancing), but it's geared more towards smaller babies (sitting up, crawling, etc.)."
3,Average purchase,"I purchased this DVD for my 4month old after realizing how much she loved watching ""baby Mozart"" her first Baby Einstein video. This next purchase was age appropriate but she didnt like it much I think because it didnt have as much music envovled. I considered it avg purchase because mid way through the dvd it skips. Price was great, delivery great, quality average."
3,Baby's First Moves,A great item for newborn's - children over 18 months old do not have any interest.
3,Not for 3 mo. olds like DVD recommends,The DVD cover states this is for babies 3mo+. My daughter is 3 mo and pays no attention to this whatsoever. Babies at 3mo are interested in watching the moving toy parts or the bright colors move around on the tv screen. Maybe this would be a good DVD for babies that are getting ready to crawl at the very youngest.
5,Must Have,"We have every Einstein that has come out, but by far this one is my daughters favorite. Maybe because there are other children in the movie and she is an only child. Everytime we put this DVD in she gets really excited. She has learned to do so many things from imitating the movie. I have bought several copies to give to all of our friends."
1,Scared Baby,"My daughter got this video at the age of 12 months.She was, and still now at the age of two, still frighten of this video. Everytime i put it on she runs out the room and starts crying. If i even say ""Baby's First Moves"" she starts saying ""No"" and leaves the room. I cannot find a reason why she isn't in love with this particular video. I am a collector of Baby Einstein and my daughter has been watching it since she was 3 months. This is the only video she does not like to watch. She can not wait for Einstein Pals to come out. Hopefully, this will be a hit."
2,best for the little litle guys.,"my daughter loves these movies, and now that she's 21 months still enjoys watching them. But I have to say that this one is a little dull, I like the consept but it lacks new material, and she wont watch it. I guess if you have a little guy that isnt walking or moving around this might be nice, otherwise you might be better off turning on the radio and saving some money on this one."
1,dissapointed,"With a brand name like disney , I expected something better. This was the first dvd my kid refused to sit and watch. It just contains pictures with music.They could have done a better job."
2,dun know,I just bought this for my children... and it is nothing of I expected... it is way much better the baby move by fisher price and cheaper. This one is boring in my opinion and even my kids... Too bad I bought it.
3,Aquatic Chemistry text for introductory course,I used this text for a one-quarter introductory Aquatic Chemistry course. The tableau method to solve equilibrium problems was positively received only by about half the students. Other texts used for this course are Pankow and Stumm and Morgan. (None of them were free of difficulties. Stumm and Morgan still serves as the best reference; but readability is a problem for an introductory course.) Morel does a good job in the treatment of metal ion kinetics.
4,okay i like it,"a line in page is distorted, yet i understand this is a fault of the publisherBUT there is a scratch on the back coverlife is not easy at all when you feel obliged to buy a textbook and there is scratch in your loved book"
1,The worst book ever,There aren't many good things to say about this book (except that I got rid of it). You have to read it with the authors around you to get a clue what they're talking about.
2,hoops with coach K,will only work on an older pc with win95. would not work with newer pc's with win98. screen small and hard to enjoy. content good.
1,Save your money,"I was excited to get this but didn't work on three different computers I tried. Win 95, 98 and XP didn't recognize the software. Buy Coach K's video series... they work."
5,"Wonderfully corny, romantic French ""operette"" songs","This is an excellent collection of corny, romantic operette songs, recorded in the 1950s by singer Luis Mariano. Although Mariano was born in Spain, he emigrated to France in the 1930s and became a star in the French music halls. These recordings are from later in his career, but they are still a lot of fun. Recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue French Music Guide)"
3,I hope I don't get bad karma for writing this.,"This book is a collection of stories and essays about Chan with a short Q & A section at the end. Although some of the stories are slightly amusing, there is not much to be learned from reading it. Perhaps, due to a translation problem, this book gives the impression that Buddhism is full of superstitious nonsense and could be the inspiration for a B movie.Another reviewer compared the writer of this book to Master Sheng Yen, and I completely disagree. Master Sheng Yen's writing is organized and demystifies Chan which is contrary to this book. Hsuan Hua does not explain things well, and his approach is extremely narrow. He writes only about sitting in lotus or half lotus while meditating although there are myriad ways of sitting. In the Q & A section, when asked about a transcendental method, he says it is ""false thinking"".There are many books about Buddhism, Chan, and meditation that I would recommend before this one."
4,Solid Message and Great Music.,"I really enjoyed this CD. The OC Supertones continue to mature as a band and this CD is a step in the right direction as far as I'm concerned. Don't forget to read the words so you don't miss the message, it's great stuff."
4,"Slight Changes in Style, But Never the Message","The Supertones are back once again in Loud and Clear, and once again their music reaches another plateau. Even though the new style is very good, I miss the trombone/trumpet drive that used to dominate on the older albums. It almost seems that they rely too much on their guitars.Even though the music may be a tiny bit off, lyrics as always stay crystal clear and inspiring. You won't need the liner notes to know the lyrics, but you'll want to read the insight into the writing of each song and see the hilarious pictures inside regardless.If I could give this 4 1/2 stars, I would. Although not perfect, Loud and Clear is most definitely not to be missed."
4,Great CD,I love the 'tones. This CD is no different. Some may wonder however why I gave it 4 stars. My reason: Where's the ska. I love the first two Supertones CDs and wish they would bring back some more traditional ska-style sounds.
1,Best Thing Since Kumbaya,"If you enjoyed OC Supertones' first two CD's, leave this one on the shelf, it will only disappoint you. The group has abandoned all by the thinnest of ska influence (like most ""ska"" bands that survived the genre's loss of mainstream popularity) and their lyrics, once so intelligent, have become merely repetitious (i.e. Does it not make anyone else cringe to here the phrase ""Pandora's Box"" repeated almost twenty times within a few minutes time?) It seems to me that while No Doubt moved towards straight alt. rock, and Less Than Jake moved towards straight punk, OC Supertones are looking for something more ambitious: campfire singalong songs. This CD may appeal to a younger generation (think middle school) but for those of us who were skanking to the Supertones at their height, it is a major let down."
1,This CD [is bad]!! There old stuff is soooooo much better!!!,"Do not buy this cd, it is absolute garbage! The only good song on this entire cd is ""Jury Duty"" but the rest of them are horrible. Ever since they got rid of Kevin Chen and Dave Chevalier, this band has gone totally downhill. They'll never release a cd quite like their first two ever again."
5,Great CD,"This is one of the Supertones best albums. They don't really have a bad album to be honest. But there are some really good songs on here. My favorite has got to be ""Return Of The Revolution"". A funny story about that one. One time I was riding in the car with my dad I was 13 (that was 6 years ago) and I had just gotten this CD. So I popped it in and it got to that song where the siren plays. My dad pulled over to the side of the road thinking it was a police car or something like that. Pretty funny huh.Anyway, this CD has got that classic Supertone sound with songs like ""Jury Duty"", ""Wilderness"", ""What It Comes To"" w/ Toby Mac, and ""Pandora's Box"". This a classic Supertone album and I highly recommend it to everyone. 6 stars buy it today."
2,I Guess It's Ok....,"I know alot of people really like the Supertones. People who like the same kinds of music I enjoy. So I was persuaded to purchase this cd. But I don't really like it. It's not that i think they are musically untalented or that they suck, It's just not my style. I don't wanna sound stupid, but...It doesn't rhyme. I think this would help a whole lot. If only the lyrics rhymed. That's all i ask. My advice: listen to more than one song before you go and buy the cd. You'll probably like it. I just don't."
1,personal preference,"For some of these pieces, I prefer the recordings of artists such as Daniel Barenboim, Martha Argerich, Emanuel Ax, Byron Janis, or John Ogdon."
3,Not sure what to think,"I love Lang's interpretation of the Haydn because it is so immaculate. He listens so that every note is placed carefully.I'm not sure what is going through Lang's head with the Rachmaninoff, or the Brahms or the Tchaikovsky because everyone seems to have something negative to say about his playing. But I reserve judgement of his playing of the heavyweight compositions here for a later time."
3,Technically brilliant; no soul.,"I won't bore you with lots of details, but I agree with B. Johnson. I have now listened to this CD and have heard Lang Lang in concert twice. He has fantastic technical ability, but his playing has no soul, or as B Johnson sais ""no clue"". Finding the soul of the music tends to come with maturity, but will it happen for Lang Lang? We will have to wait and see (hear). This CD is a very interesting listen, but could never be one that I would reach for when wanting to enjoy these particular pieces."
3,Needs a teacher,"I just heard Lang Lang perform the Rachmaninoff concerto #2 live, in addition to hearing this CD. Technically competent, although he fakes passages in the last movement of the Rach concerto. However, musically he is still not competent and exhibits student-like phrasing (a bad student). His sense of lyricism and musical taste is highly unrefined and undeveloped--his playing at this point is mere mockery of the great pianists mentioned by the other reviewer. It is resoundingly obvious to me that he has received very little high level teaching, attention, and/or guidance."
4,The Cookery Calendar by Woman's World Magazine,"The Woman's World Cookery Calendar of Tested Recipes showing the most effective methods of selecting food and the most attractive ways of preparing it, in order to secure the greatest degree of nutrition and economyThe Cookery Calendar: Being a Selection of Tested Recipes for Every Month and Properly Balanced Menus based on nutrition and economy, with cooking time tables for exact resultsAlso contains several pages of Charts for Jelly and Jam Making with Complete Directions for Canning"
5,She has more books in her,"I was personally aquainted with this author through telephone conversations @ 1991, and it is too bad she hasn't been able to put out a sequel. Anyway you don't have to know the author to appreciate the journey she takes you on: that of understanding the behaviors of sexually abused children, and your reaction to the situation of not having been able to protect your own from this devistating harm. It is a wonderfully non-recriminating religious approach to knowledge that empowers."
4,Classic Martin Deeny Album,The cost of the disc was about the same price for the downloads so i went for the hard copy.Good classic Martin Deeny music.
3,Not the right episode,"While I thank Amazon for putting the first season of one of my favorite shows online, this is not the episode it states it is. This episode is Episode 4: Dead Man Dating, not seven. And every episode is like this. Please fix this amazon. I had to go through seven different episodes just to find this one, since this is the one I wanted to watch."
2,Annoying previews,"While the boxed set - Charmed-The Complete First Season is exactly what it is supposed to be, we have been unable to spend much time watching it. At the start of each episode you are forced to watch previews of coming dvds. There seems to be no way to skip past, or to otherwise avoid them. The experience has made for less than pleasant viewing."
4,Good,Charmed - Fitst Season was received in good condition and was shipped quickly. I would do business again. Haven't viewed the product yet as it's a Christmas gift for my daughter. Thank you.
5,Charmed is amazing!,"I have watched Charmed since it first premiered in 1998, it's my favorite show out there the actors are great and the story line is very neat. I really enjoyed the season 1, 6 disc set. It was well worth the money, and I plan to get each and every season! There is no show out there that is as good as Charmed."
4,"great, but a few problems","it's awesome that the episodes are finally on DVD, but it seems like there wasnt very much thought put into it. There are no extra features, and the quality of the episodes isnt very good. its a little bit fuzzy...althought that just might be because they're older. I'm glad to have the episodes, but a little dissapointed because they could have made it better."
5,a definite must have,i've started watching charmed after prue died but i am watching the reruns and i've fallen under the charmed ones spell and can't get enough if it so i've been waiting for this one to come out. now i can final see how it all began and would advice anyone one who likes charmed to buy this and add to thier dvd collection
2,"""Your Fired""","I'm sure that the producers of this DVD never seen ""The Apprentice"". They wouldn't have lasted a day.No excuse for putting out such a poor product. Where are all the extras? The producers of this DVD must have figured people have been waiting so long for its release they'll buy anything. They were right, they got me. I'm a fan of the show and have all the episodes recorded, so if all there going to do is show me something I've already seen, then I don't need to purchase any of the other seasons. I'll wait before I invest in season 2."
5,Charmed Finally on DVD!!!,"Finally they got something right! Many people have been waiting for this show to come out and I dont see why anyone wouldnt be waiting for it! I love this show with the acting of Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano, and Rose McGowan they are all tremendous, Shannen Doherty was also good to the show but Rose is clearly the better sister! Seasons 4-7 (so far) have been very good except for some fairy tale (episodes) that were clearly fillers. But I did ike seasons 1-3 which clearly told about their lives progressing as they accepted the fact of being witches. All in all, this show is awesome and looking to be a HUGE hit on DVD!"
5,Charmed 1!,"I've been a huge fan of 'Charmed' since it first started on TV in 1998. Ever since then I've been waiting for it to be released on DVD. And its finally happened!!The entire first season is in this box set, though the word is, there isn't be any extras. Normally I'd mark it down for this, but heck! This is charmed!!Something Wicca This Way ComesI've Got You Under My SkinThank you for not MorphingDead Man DatingDream SorcererThe Wedding From HellThe Fourth SisterThe Truth is Out There...

1,Spelling Needs to Pay Royalties to Wheadon..,"Like Dr. Frankenstein, Spelling took parts from Buffy and Angel, removed their hearts and brains and replaced them with Cheese-in-a-Can and added 3 staples from his harem. This vile creature he names ""Charmed""; I guess that was a joke.That's why its still on TV; it does'nt challenge the viewer or take risks like Buffy or Angel. And the whining! All three main characters whine about their powers, moan about their boyfriend-of-the-week, complain about their siblings, the sky, their house, EVERYTHING! I cannot stand the whining.Maybe that's why the demons want to kill the ""Charmed"", they can't stand the moaning either. I wish the demons would hurry up and finish them off and put an end to all that bad acting. An hour of this show is like spending a day in box trapped with 3 unhappy housecats. The DVDs would make great clay pigeons though.."
5,Great!,It was great to finally be able to buy the Charmed complete first season! It was so long ago since I saw it on tv so I was really happy to be able to see it all over again! For those of you who are interested in beginning watching this show I can guarantee you will enjoy it! It is very fun to watch! I hope they keep coming out with the other seasons on DVD soon! I would love to own the entire collection!
4,Please Give Us More,"I love that the DVD set has finally come out, however I am very disappointed that there are no extras. And I have to agree with some other fans that have expressed their displeasure with the package. It does seem to denote disrespect, not only towards the show but to the core of any successful series, to the fans. It has been wonderful watching the show uninterupted or edited for time. The ladies on this show have been a delight to watch over the years and to see how much they have grown as actresses.Just one other request to Paramount. Please consider all of the hearing impaired fans out there."
3,It's okay...,"Well of course I am estatic to finally have CHarmed Season 1 on DVD, it's awesome! But there are no extra features whatsoever, the packaging they are in is possibly the cheapest packaging EVER for DVD's and the sound is off in at least one episode ""From Fear to Eternity"". I know they could have done so much better than this... heaven knows they had enough time!"
3,"Good Show! DVD's not so ""Charming"".","I have been an avid follower of the show since its debut and I have been eagerly awaiting the release of the DVDs. I couldn't be more disappointed in this collection. Yeah it is great that I can watch all the episodes when I want. But I can do that anyway with the arrival of TIVO. I generally buy DVDs for the ""extras"". This collection has absolutely no extras, no anamorphic menus, no chapter menus. NOTHING! How about some interviews, some behind the scenes, some character bios, ANYTHING?Whoever is responsible for this should be VANQUISHED!"
3,Where's the beef?,"I love love LOVE the show, but the Charmed DVD box set is sadly lacking in extras. Where are the featurettes? Outtakes? Interviews? Commentaries? I thought these were the staples of a DVD box set. Otherwise, why wouldn't I just continue watching the VHS tapes recorded from TV? Someone needs to WAKE UP and give the fans what we want!"
3,3 out of 5 .... AT BEST,"I'm a HUGE fan of the show, watched it from the beginning. I knew that there were no special features when I bought the DVD set, so, I wasn't disappointed in the DVD set, in general. If this DVD set was any more expensive, I probably wouldn't have gotten it knowing this fact. DVD quality is OKAY.. Not exactly high quality but reasonable. Don't expect allot out of this set. Has all of the episodes of first season divided up on 6 discs and that is it.I suggest that if you are not an absolute hardcore fan of the show - you should save your money. Unless this is something you REALLY, REALLY want."
3,Charmed wait,"Even though we waited a really long time for this DVD. They didn't take the time to notice, the sound is off a few times in the set. Also the third disk stops after the first epesode and will not let you watch the entire disk. Mabye they should recall it and make it better for everyone. I returned mine to the store where I got it. I really want a set that works well."
3,Good show...bad set,"Many fans have waited a long time for Charmed to come out on DVD. Its finally here, but really...so what? Yea its cool to own them on DVD and watch them whenever you want, but the set just looks sloppy. The cover is the best thing of the set, and even that isn't stellar. The entire packagaing is cheesey and I could have done a much better job in Photoshop and it wouldn't take that long. You can tell that this is not the company that releases Buffy and Angel DVDs. Also, there is not a single extra on this set. I will be getting the next 3 seasons, but unfortunately the show is crap now. Seasons 1-4 are its best times, and if your new to the show I say stop at the end of season 4. It just goes downhill from there."
3,A Disappointing DVD Set,"I'm a huge Charmed fan and I will continue to buy every single season, but I was really expecting more since the show is so great and has such cool special effects but there's nothing! It's really not that big of a deal, but they charge way too much for this box set considering there are no extras. I paid $50 for this set and all it has are the episodes, no extras, no deleted scenes, no commentary, not even a chapter selection. I love the show, but this set isn't worth the money. If you haven't already bought it, I'd suggest waiting until it goes on sale."
3,Many too harsh,"I have watched many episodes of Charmed and have to say that many are being too harsh. A great show? No. An okay one though. The acting runs from okay to very good. I feel Doherty and Combs do the best (Combs especially in later seasons). I have to agree with many that the writing is the weak point of this show. Many shows are somewhat formulaic and ""hokey"". Still, an overall decent show."
3,These episodes are out of sequence and titled incorrectly,The show Charmed itself is an entertaining yet flawed show.The main issue with the product itself is that Amazon has the episodes out of order and incorrectly titled at the time of this review. Please attempt to address this issue as it is very confusing when attempting to watch the episodes chronologically.
5,Amazing Show,"I have watched Charmed since the first time Episode 1 aired. Season 1 was a great first season for a wonderful show. You laugh, you cry and you will fall in love with the CHARMED ONES'."
4,"Chiming in on ""Charmed""","After reading a lot of the reviews for this set and hearing bad things (grainy picture, bad sound, no extras), I was hesitant to buy it. Well, I bit the bullet and made the purchase anyway.As someone who is very picky about her DVDs and quality, I'd have to say I found very little to complain about. The picture was fine (I always remember thinking the first season seemed a little ""off"" in picture quality), had no problems with the sound and I love the cases (makes it a lot easier to transport if you only wanted to take one disc with you somewhere). Some reviewers complained about these cases. Actually, I think they're better than the cases you get with many other sets, such as Angel and Buffy, because you don't have the worry of the teeth breaking off and the disc not staying in place ... especially if you have butterfingers (like me!).I'm very happy this show came out on DVD and I look forward to buying the other seasons upon release!"
2,Love the show but...,The episodes are all scrambled and some repeat like episode 2 is episode one and episode 2 is 6. Please Amazon fix this its my favorite show!
3,"I love this show, BUT","I am a huge fan of Charmed, and have loved it since it began. I was so excited when I found out that the show would be released on DVD! I ran out and bought it the day it came out. I watched it virtually non-stop until I was done! BUT...I was very disappointed when I discovered there aren't any special features. I realize it takes a little more work to come up with extras for DVD releases, but I was really hoping for a little something. The only thing in the set that isn't the episodes is trailers for 2 other series that will be released on DVD soon. Honestly, I don't care about that. I want behind the scenes footage, bloopers, a little documentary about how they did the special effects...stuff like that.I'm not saying it's not worth the money...just realize before you buy it that all you will get is the episodes (which are 'charming').I still love the show, and am ready for them to release season 2!"
3,Good Show but DVD Could Be Better.,"A previous reviewer seems to think that only people who are 13 years old and people who are personally into Whicca watch Charmed well I'm not personally into Whicca and I'm over 13 and and I know plenty of older people who like this show and I personally like Charmed because of the actors, the thrilling episodes that have mixes of horror, humor, drama and fantasy and the family dynamics of the three sisters and another thing I like about this show is that it's a lot like Buffy and Angel but has it's own unique twist! I got the Charmed first season DVD and the shows are great though it's disappointing that they didn't bother to add any extras. They could have thrown it's fans a bone and shown behind the scenes footage and shown us the pilot with the different actress playing Phoebe (even though I can't picture anyone playing her but Alyssa Milano) but I'm still not sorry I got this DVD and I recommend it to all fans of Charmed!"
5,Can't get enough!!,I am so excited that Charmed is finally being released on DVD!! I am a huge fan of the show and have been watching it since it first aired. Thank you Paramount for finally releasing it!!
5,Love this show!,"I avoided watching this show for a long time, due to the fact that I'm Wiccan and I don't watch that much TV. Movies, yes, TV, not so much. In fact Gilmore Girls is the only other series I've bought the DVD's for. Anyways, I caught a couple of the early episodes on TNT and really liked them, I thought I'd give season 1 a chance. I'm so glad I did! I really love the sisters and I enjoyed all the things they got themselves into and out of. I don't feel that they belittled Wicca at all, which was my impression before I watched it. They show real Wiccans in a fairly real way, like in the pilot episode and they Friday 13th ones in particular. Anyways, go into in with no preconceptions, and enjoy!"
3,charmed first season,charmed first season helps you remember where it all began for the power of three.
5,Charmed by Charmed!,"I have been Charmed by Charmed! Since the show's debut in 1998, I have been a loyal fan and was thrilled when the Charmed DVD was released. I have watched the episodes from Season 1 many times, and find them extremely enjoyable.For the individual who wrote the review claiming only ""people who have an IQ above their shoe size would like this show"", I beg to note that his IQ cannot be very high since he doesn't know how to spell ""effects"" ""dignity"" and uses capital letters in the middle of a sentence for no grammatically correct reason.For all others considering purchasing the Charmed DVD, this show consistently offers episodes which centre around values, family and of course, sheer fun and entertainment. A must have for any Charmed fan!"
2,disappointed,"As you can tell from the title of my review, I was a little disappointed by this DVD. Of course I'm not disappointed with the show, but more so the features, or lack of features on the discs.There are absolutely NO special features and not even subtitles!!!It seems like someone just threw the episodes together really quick and put them up on sale!"
2,Seacon One,"Well this was the first of the charmed season sadly it was the most boring of them all. Prue which was the boss was over done as a character. No big sister is really like that bossy and bitchy. Phoebe was great as always full of spirit, the only one that kept things interesting. piper, which was the middle sister, she my second favorite. She was very sweet and her power was probably the coolest."
2,What! No Extras?,"Very disappointed that I waited this long to get what I already had, the basic episode. I had taped most of the episodes off of the TNT network. I don't understand why they didn't have any extras. They have 7 years of episodes, its hard to believe they can't come up with anything extra. This is one of my favorite shows but I will not buy the next season unless they come down in price or add some extras."
3,Where's the extras?!,"Charmed could have easily been a simple television retread of The Craft. Instead, it has become, over the years and seven seasons later, a positive representation of smart, beautiful, empowered women. The show quickly dispels the traditional image of witches as evil, old hags dressed in black and riding broomsticks and presents them as contemporary women who tap into Mother Nature and fight for the forces of good. Charmed also treats the Wicca religion with the proper amount of respect that it deserves.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this set is the appalling lack of extras. With such a devoted fan base that has waited so long for DVDs of this show to finally come out, the surprising lack of extras is a real slap in the face. No trailers, featurettes, or commentaries. Nothing. The folks at Paramount really need to study the work Fox has done on their TV shows (especially Angel and Buffy) to see how it's done and to support the show's loyal fans."
2,Uncharmed,"I LOVE Charmed. I have been waiting for this dvd for YEARS, BUT... First, the picture quality is poor by dvd standards. Usually the sharper dvd picture jumps out at you but the compression for this dvd is a POOR choice. It gives a picture about as good as brodcast TV. Second... there is no second, there is nothing else, no features, no comentaries, not even a scene selection. In conclusion, a GREAT show but one of the POOREST dvd presentations I've seen to date - what a SHAME."
5,I have been waiting for this news since 1999,"I have been a fan of Charmed since I read its first book called 'The power of three', and after reading that book I was so interested that I started watching the program, and since then I have seen this program religiously...never missing an episode. I know for sure, that when it comes out on DVD, I will probably be the first in line to get it...trust me, if you like buffy and angel, u will love this....this is soooo much better than those two....but the key to the whole program is that you have to be fair to it, you have to watch a couple of episodes coz only then you will understand their lives, and how the three girls live it...."
3,Finally,"I love the series. And have been waiting for the set's to come out. I am very happy to re-live the first series on DVD without comercials. But the lack of chapter select's and Special features (including Audio commentary) is what lowered my rating to a 3. I am a fan of Buffy and Angel, and since I have all their seasons I wanted to collect my other favorite. CHARMED will always be i the top 3."
5,Love The Show but are these the Complete Uncut Episodes?,"Charmed is a really good show! Having no extra features in the DVD's is really disappoing though especially not having the pilot where Phoebe was not Alyssa Milano but another actor.I started watching this show last year in TNT reruns and I'm wondering if the episodes in this set are unedited or are they the edited TV episodes, I'm wondering because usually when you buy a TV DVD and you had seen the edited TV reuns you see that they cut out things for more commercials and wehn you see the uncut episodes on DVD you are like pretty amazed but the episodes of Charmed in the DVD's don't look any different than the TNT reruns and I haven't noticed anything that appeared to not be shown on TNT so are these episodes uncut just like the original WB airings or are they edited? Or does TNT show the episdes uncut?"
4,Excellent but lacks extras,"Finally the first season is out on dvd!! Theres woo and hoo for this collection, but then theres...oh no extras... The dvd collection lacks any exrtas, such as commentaries and interveiw etc... Great collection but they need to take a leaf out of angel and buffys book and add some extras for the fans!!!!"
5,Charmed is the best show!!,"This is a long awaited DVD!! Charmed is one of the best, most interesting shows on tv. The three sister witches combine drama and humor into this great show. All of the episodes have such original and fun themes.Every season of Charmed is great, but this first season is a must see in that it shows how the sisters become witches & how they learn how to use their powers and fight evil. You also learn how the girls meet Leo & how they stumble upon his whitelighter secret. I can't wait to buy this dvd!"
3,Eh. Glad to have it. Could be better.,"Cons:1. There's no surround sound of any kind, digital 5.1 or otherwise, like most other DVDs have, so if you have a surround sound system, you're stuck with hearing the sound from just your front speakers. Hey, at least it's in stereo.2. Absolutely no extras.3. A bunch of previews for other DVD sets before you can get to the Menu, but just hitting ""Next"" on your remote (as ""Menu"" doesn't work) can skip each one until you finally arrive at the Menu. This only appears on the first DVD, so it's not *that* much of a nuisance.Pros:1. Great packaging, although they seem to have spent more on the packaging than the DVD content.2. Hey, the set actually exists now, after years of empty promises and false hopes. Although they could have done a better job at making the DVDs more enjoyable (besides just having the episodes), as it stands now, beggars can't be choosers. I'm a diehard Charmed fan, so I'm darn glad to have it."
3,Thank god I got this for $29.99!,"I've been waiting for this DVD set for years and I bought it yesterday. Not only does it have no extras (relatively unheard of for tv dvd sets), but it doesn't even have scene selection And they expect people to spend 50 dollars on this?? I hope that the future DVD's will be more than just the episodes. The fans deserve better."
2,Hello...EXTRAS?,"I was very happy to learn that Charmed was being released on dvd-finally!! When I opened the package, I was very disappointed to learn there were no extras. I wondered if Paramount understands what owning a dvd boxed set, like this one, means to the fans. Interviews from the staff and actors gives us useful information about the show and episodes we always wanted or needed to know. It seeemed as if Paramount just rushed the product out with the expectation that it would fail. I hope they make this up to us during the next releases."
3,Charmed Finally !,"Well it took them a while to release Charmed on DVD... i wonder why? Am really glad that it is now here.However, having waited so long for it's release.. i kinda expect it to be much better. For example, there wasn't any inserts of any interviews with the sisters and other cast members included in the DVD collection. That is a disappointment. And If you look closely, the sisters' Father's surname is not Haliwell. It 's Bennett i think. The cover should have beeb proof read before it went to print.. This suggests to me that the release wasn't really well planned. Hopefully the next series will be."
1,How can you give this show 5 stars???,"I picked up a copy of this because I was told ""If you like buffy you'll like charmed"". Well that is definitly NOT the case. The CGI effects are terrible, the plots are predictable and the acting is hideous! I'm just half-way through the DVDs, after this I'm going to sell the box set and never turn back again. Honestly, what do you people see in charmed? I can't find one aspect I like about it. Also the DVD quality itself is bad. I tried watching it on 3 different TVs, definitly not worthy of DVD quality status.If your a Josh Whedon fan than do yourself a favor and passby charmed. Josh good have done a better job writing this show when he was 12."
5,YIPPIE!,It is about time they are putting the Charmed episodes on DVD. I have been waiting for this forever. I am a loyal Charmed fan and am ready for the box set!
2,Great Show--Disappointing DVD Set,"Like many other reviewers, I was EXTREMELY disappointed when I realized there are no extras on this set of DVDs. None. Nada. Nil. Not even scene selection or subtitles. What a waste of money. I've already recorded the show using my digital video recorder many times over as they've aired the re-runs. If I had known there were no extras, there is no way I would have purchased this set of DVDs!"
5,CHARMED SEAS0N 1 IS FINALLY ON DVD!!!! ITS AB0UT TIME,"DAMN ITS AB0UT TIME!!! =) I GOT AN EARLY COPY OF THIS DVD ABOUT 3 DAYS AG0 AT WORK... AS SOON AS I GOT HOME OPENED THE PACKAGE AND STARTED TO WATCH EVERY SINGLE EPISODE... I WAS SO HAPPY I FINALLY WATCHED THE FIRST SEASON, BECAUSE I WATCHED ALL THE EPISODES EXCEPT THE PILOT... SO YEAH BASICALLY WHAT I'M SAYING THAT GET THIS DVD BECAUSE ITS WORTH IT!!!! =)"
4,Good Show...But Nothing New,"Because the entire family loves this show, I bought this box set. Every first season show is included in all its glory. That part is fine. I'm happy with the packaging quality and the DVD navigation quality.But there are no (zero zip zilch) extras on these discs. You aren't getting anything that you wouldn't get if you set up your Tivo to record the show every week. I was a bit disappointed that after paying for this set I didn't get anything that I hadn't already seen."
5,The wait is over.....almost!!!!,I have been waiting forever for this to come to DVD. Now how much longer are we going to have to wait till we get the rest of the show!!!!
3,Not so Charmed Set,"I picked up Charmed Season One tonight. While I love the series and it's good to see Shannen Doherty as Prue again. I was sadden by the lack of extras. No interviews, no commentary, no photos, no behind the scenes, not even the original pilot with Lori Rom as Phoebe! Sure it cost about $40. But still, with in this day and age. You would think you would get some extras on a series box set. But alas, we didn't. This set was seriously badly put together. Especially since this set is being released by Paramount who has done wonderful season set for other series like Star Trek."
5,I'm Just Glad To Have The Episodes On DVD!,"I love Charmed. It's a great show and despite the lack of any extra features I'm still very glad that I have the episodes on DVD. One of the best presents I ever got! I have been reading the reviews and I have to adress the people who are putting the show downa and calling it stupid, the actors stupid and the fans stupid, ETC, well some of them really need to learn how to spell. Stupid is not spelled Stupit, stoopid or stoopit. Dumb is not spelled dum. I could go on and on, but I will just leave it at that! This show is awesome and I recommend this first season DVD and I plan on getting the second season too, ETC!"
5,About time!!!!,"I love this series and am so pleased to finally own it on DVD! I ordered it just over 2 weeks ago and it arrived 3 days ago. I wasn't prepared to wait until June to buy it over here (in the UK),so ordered it from you.Just waiting for series 2 to be released!The girls, story lines and special effects are fantastic!"
4,Great Show,This was one of my favorite shows when it was on television. I bought the first 2 seasons because of the price. I think the first was the best.
4,The titles are off?,"The shows seem to be off, I thought I was going to be watching the 2nd episode but it was actually the 1st episode repeated. I hope that means I dont miss the last episode. I also hope amazon adds more episodes because I used to love this show as a kid and would love to relive my childhood :)"
3,Paramount could've done better with this box set.,"Finally! Charmed is on DVD. While it's good to finally have it, I'm a little disappointed that there are no extras whatsoever. I wasn't expecting commentaries, but a first season summary like Buffy and Angel do on their respective sets and a featurette about the creation of the show, considering the hazard of casting Shannen Doherty and replacing Lori Rom as Phoebe. The sound is only Dolby Surround 2.0 and no subtitles (close-captioning only).Thanks for finally getting it out, but extras do make it better."
3,"Awesome Show, but DVD Hindered by Lazy and Shoddy Work!",Charmed is an awesome TV show but the DVDs stink!Aaron Spelling seems to have hired lazy workers to put the DVD together as they cut corners and left out extra features and worse of all didn't make menu access to scene selection!Lets hope the delay of the 2nd season on DVD means that Aaron Speling has realized the mistake and is fixing it!
4,"No extras, no subtitles.","First of all, I would like to say that I am a big fan of the Charmed series, but I believe this package could be better. It doesn't have any extras or even subtitles, and the codification is not exactly the best. However, if you are a fan of Charmed, I suggest you buy it because it has all the season 1 episodes. Let's just hope that Warner Bros will put some extras on the final Charmed season, whenever that may be."
2,breaks!,the handle pops of alot and if u put it back on it will pop off again. now i dont have a hande on mine n i have 2 carry it from da bottom. U CAN GET IT IF U WANT BUT I'M TELLIN U IT WILL BREAK
4,Great stuff!,I love this stuff for wrinkles. It really helps. I've used it for years. It doesn't irritate my skin or make me break out.
3,DANCE MANUAL,This book shows the development of his father's work. it is of interest to dance historians and to ballet teachers today.I enjoyed helping the translator on this project and use some of the exercises in my classes.
3,A few things you should know about 'Nemesis Divina',"Not as great as 'The Shadowthrone', 'Nemesis Divina' still contains some outstanding pieces, notably 'Immortality Passion' (""where the howling winds rage, and the mountains are majestic, I can breathe...but where there is human flesh, I feel strangled...""), and 'Mother North'. While the latter was made into a cheesy video clip, the song itself is a masterpiece of ecological militance. Much more effective than the Midnight Oil song which it quotes ('Beds are Burning'), it contains a promise of revenge: ""Phantom North, I'll be there when you hunt them down..."" That should make the defilers of the earth quake in their boots...but sadly most of them will never hear it."
4,I don't know if it's 4 or 5 stars ? Still it's good......,"I rated 4 but it can be 4.5 so i'll go with 4.25. I don't have the original release for this one , but i have all the tracks in mp3 format. Standout tracks are Mother North and The Dawn Of A New Age.The album would have been 5 stars but i don' seem to like the vocals too much . Their not bad, but not as scary as Nocturno Culto's or as harsh and cold as Abbath.To end this review i would recomend this album to anyone who loves or likes bands like Immortal,Darkthrone,Emperor,Mayhem,Dimmu Borgir."
3,Mother North is all,This cd shows the way the black metal scence is going. From Satan to Pagan. Mother North is the only good song on this cd. It tries to mix Darkness and Tree-hugging.
4,Fresh new sound for black metal champions,"This trio of Norwegian black-metallers are somewhat stalwart veterans of the scene, and alongside the likes of fellow countrymen Emperor, they continue to carry the battle-flag high. Improving on a majestic and epic album like ""The Shadowthrone"" could never be achieved, so Satyricon have smartly decided to forge a new chapter in their music... when Nemesis Divina was first released it was so unlike anything else in the BM scene at the time, and until Satyricon's next full-length album is released, it still remains so. Experimentation is a key attraction for this album, with band leader Satyr not afraid to implement the use of keyboards and samples. The guitars and drums , as is Satyricon's hallmark, are upfront and booming , and the production in general is of quality. This album will grab you by the throat when you first hear it, and, as Satyr growls in the introduction of opening track Dawn of a New Age : ""This is ARMAGEDDON!"""
4,an essential for black metal fans,One of their best to round off their first three classic albums. Killer riffs on the whole ablum great melodic guitar work. Mother north is one of my favorite black metal songs. A more developed black metal sound on this album with out going overboard with the production.
3,Palace Bros. revisited,"Not as ethereal or head-in-the-clouds as most of David Pajo's M material. Instead, this record has more of an earthy, down-home, backwoods folk predominance. This of course lends itself well to Pajo's trademark minimalism. I would have appreciated these songs much more if they didn't sound like what Pajo was doing with Will Oldham eight years ago. It isn't bad by any means; it's good, solid, and heartfelt. I'm only penalizing it for being a blatant regression.Warning: contains banjo"
2,Couldn't plough through the Zen-like fluff...,"An avid reader, I couldn't manage to plough through the ""peaceful household"" Zen-like initial portion of the book. Accordingly, I abandoned the book mid-read...an almost unheard of phenomenon for me.I was hoping, not for advice on deep breathing exercises, but for tangible parenting advice that I could readily employ. And please stop summarizing for me what I just read.Give this one a pass."
1,Dont Buy,"I recently bought this coffee maker and although I saw others a step up I thought this would be adequate. The burner on this machine does not heat up enough for the coffee to remain warm and in fact from brewing to pouring it to serve, it was lukewarm. The filter was very deep and included a water filter that was difficult to align and close the lid.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one."
3,Mr. Coffee not doing so well?,"This Mr. Coffee gave out way to early, and then we received a newer version, which overflowed the counters, and has been a minature nightmare."
2,This lasted for 3 years and stopped working properly beyond repair,We used this everyday. It was a great coffee maker for 3 years and then suddenly stopped working properly. First the programmable timer stopped working altogether and then the heating element started to overheat the coffee during the brewing process causing half the water to evaporate before it hit the carafe and a burnt taste to the coffee that it actually did brew.Buyer Beware!
5,Wonderful Coffeemaker,"So much better than my old Braun. The Mr. Coffee FTX21 is very durable and well-built. It uses basket filters which are more readily available and cheaper than cone filers. I find that basket filter-based coffee makers brew more slowly than cone-based coffee makers. They deliver a bolder, richer flavor than cone-based coffer makers."
1,Never again! Two strikes you're out!,"Ok, as of this writting, this will be our second try at this Coffee Maker and the second time it has proven itself to be a piece of junk! We purchased our original one a couple of years ago and thought it was great! Lot's of extras and a nice look for our kitchen decor. After about 8 months the unit wouldn't turn off on it's own and we simply used it as a coffee maker hot plate and unplugged it when not in use (since the burner would not turn off). We cleaned it as often as the manual suggested and in the manner suggested, it still failed and stopped working altogether. Ok, we figured we just got a bad unit but liked the look and features and figured we would give it another try. We purchased a second unit. Sure enough, even with proper care, about nine months later we were facing the EXACT same problems with the burner not shutting off. Finally, this morning, it died. Sorry, done buying Mr. Coffee anything."
2,"So Far, I'm Not Impressed!","I've had this product for less than a week, andso far, I'm not impressed. Especially when makingthe first pot of coffee, it:1) Started smoking from the water reservoir!2) Made the loudest noise I've heard from a coffee maker!3) The coffee had a very strange taste!Needless to say the jury is out on this product as faras I'm concerned. Had a Black & Decker coffee maker foryears, never a problem."
1,Not worth it,I purchased this item November 2008. It is now September 2011 and the heating element is burned out. Not even 3 yrsThis is the second identical maker I purchased the 1st burned out after 5 yrs. I won't be buying a 3rd.
1,I concur--this coffee maker stinks,"This is the worst coffee maker I have ever owned. We bought it less than a year ago, and have had every single problem listed in the other reviews.1. Makes terrible coffee2. Pause n serve broke3. Leaks4. Brew timer has never worked.This is the last Mr. Coffee I will ever buy."
1,Worst coffeepot ever,"I wish I had read the reviews here on Amazon before making this purchase (at a local Target). This coffeepot is the pits--it takes over an hour to brew, loses around 4 cups of water due to all of the steam, and oftentimes simply shuts itself off during the brew cycle. It also has quite a bit of a leaking problem. Very disappointing."
2,Gave out after a year,"The warming plate ""lost steam"" after a year and failed to keep coffee warm. Disappointed b/c I liked the appearance but with the cost that I paid you would like to get more than a year of use."
1,It Leaks! Leaks! Leaks!,"My friend has one of these and I liked it's looks so much I bought one for us. Mr. Coffee makes the coffee yes, but look for it all over your counter. We're very disappointed with it. At first it worked fine but now it's leaking coffee. We threw it out and have gone back to our old coffee maker that cost less but has been working fine for five years. And it's not a ""Mr. Coffee"" brand."
2,"IT LEAKS, IT LEAKS, IT LEAKS","We have had this coffeemaker for about a year and while I like it for the most part, I hate that it leaks. I have no idea why it leaks but I am tired of cleaning up after each brewing."
3,A good value,"We've had our Mr. Coffee coffee maker for about a year now. I can't say exactly how old it is because it came used from my mom's house. It retails for around $49.99 and you can't beat that. It has many features that are somewhat uncommon for machines in that price range. It has a cleaning function, a programmable timer, brew strength and of course the ""pause"" feature for pouring a cup of coffee during the brew process. I have recently replaced the unit because it is leaking black coffee sludge all over my counters. I did not replace with the same brand because I wanted a carafe-less machine, but I have to say that for fifty bucks it made good coffee, kept the coffee nice and hot, was reliable (we make at least one pot of coffee every day) and I never had an electrical problem with it."
1,Worthless piece of junk,I've had this coffee maker for 2 months and now it won't brew any coffee. The pump that draws the water up has died! Sounds like it is sucking air instead. Much like the sound you get at the end of brew cycle when the water is gone.
3,Mr. Coffee Takes a Leak,"This machine worked flawlessly for 5 months and then, this week, decided just to pump all the hot water out the bottom of the coffee maker.This is not a leak, it is a purge!I returned it to Costco and got another Mr. Coffee that looks identical, but has a pale blue clock instead of the glaring green eye of the bad Mr. Coffee. While Costco return is no hassle, this time I will keep the receipt."
1,Don't be fooled!!!!,"This machine is the same as other Mr. Coffee 12 Cup coffee makers, but with a different trim package (1/2 stainless vs all stainless). If you search Amazon on ""FTXSS23GTF"" you will see the horrendous revies for this piece of junk. I own one and am desperately searching for a replacement. The unit has given us nothing but problems and leaks all over our countertops."
1,15 months of coffee,"I had an original Mr coffee maker for almost 15 years and never had a problem until with age it just wore out; bought this new Mr. Coffee 12 cup with all the bells and whistles and woke up this morning to no timed coffee. It just plain didn't work, and only after 15 months, one tenth the time; seems to me that I should have been able to expect to have the same Quality of that first old machine in the new one. I will never buy a Mr. coffee maker again and if you heed the warnings, neither will you!!"
2,Wish it were better,"This product looks good and has some thoughtful features like the brew strength switch, temperature dial, and timer. But after having it for barely a year, I'm very disappointed with how it's holding up. A critical spring part of the filter basket broke (they were kind enough to send a replacement), I can't remove the carafe during brewing, it seems to leak at times, and the finish on the heating element has already burned away revealing ugly bare metal. Prior to this, I had a Krups that was still going strong after 20 years.When I replace this -- and that may be soon -- it won't be with a Mr. Coffee."
2,Quit concurrent with the Warranty expiration,"We bought the previous model, and only used it for two pots per week (one one sat and one on sunday, go figure) and while it worked fine for that purpose, thirteen months after purchase, it died. Turn it on, it comes on for a minute, then the lights fade out and ""click""..... dead... The big dissapointment? A one year warranty, so it is off to buy a replacement.If one were conspiracy minded one would have thought the clock was not only tracking daily time, but also counting down warranty balance....Now the big question? Go cheap and plan to replace annually or go more expensive with hopes of more reliability."
1,It Leaks Do not buy!!,I agree with everyone else . I've had this coffeemaker for about 2 years now and it was doing great until it started to leak. I can't make a full pot of coffee without the countertops and floors being completely soaked in coffee.
1,It LEAAAAKSS! DO NOT BUY!,"We really should have read the reviews before we bought this coffee maker. It leaks...it leaks a lot!It leaked all over our counter top and permanantly stained it, it also leaked on my wifes new shirt when she tried to stop it from destroying our countertops...that makes this one expensive coffee POS machine."
1,Disappointed American classic is made in China,"I had a Cross Classic Century 14K set for years. Due to my total carelessness, I lost them recently. I thought at least I can replace them by ordering a new set. I was wrong. The item I received today was a big disappointment. First, the color wasn't rose gold. It was rather plain yellow gold. Second, it felt so much lighter than the same pen/pencil I used to have. There was no nice heavy feel to it. Then I realize the 'USA' engraving was missing on top. I flipped the box to find 'Made in China'. I was so disgusted I didn't want the set any more. I called Cross to ask if they have anything made in USA. The lady said no... Now all Cross pens are made in China. I'm so saddened that I can never get replace my pens. You can clearly see and feel the quality is not there."
3,"Satisfactory Read, But Certainly Not 5 Stars!","This was an o.k. read, particularly after about 3/4's of the way through, but it is only a slightly better than average read at best. It was good, but it just didn't rise to a level higher than a 3 star for me, or as good as many other murder mystery writers. I also had trouble with the concept that the police, in a high level murder investigation, would have a psychologist tagging along with them in dangerous situations and all the way up until the end (although I haven't read any other Stephen White novels so I don't have anything to compare it to). Pick up if you've run out of other books to read, otherwise..."
3,Another Cotton-Candy White Book,"White's books always start out fast and keep you racing through the pages until you finally come to the part where things become totally silly. This is no exception and when you arrive at the climactic scene you're faced with a kid who is an unlikely mega-multi-tasker of death and destruction. White's good at building suspense and ending each chapter with a hanger that forces you to keep reading. The silly climax notwithstanding, this is one of White's better books. If you overlook the improbabilities, the coincidences, the elitist yuppified left-wing snarky asides, the ersatz moral concerns, etc., you may actually end up enjoying this book."
5,One of the best thrillers I have read in a long time.,"Stephen White has written a thriller that you just can't put down. I throughly enjoyed this book. Alan Gregory, the psychologist, has a dilemma in the ethical patient/doctor confidentiality when Noami Bigg relates some information that could result in the loss of lives, one of which could be his own wife, Lauren. The twists and turns as he tries to make a decision as to what he should do will keep you reading to the last page.I will defintely get more of Stephen White's books to read after this one."
4,Love this author,"I love all of Stephen White's stories, while they all differ you get the same excitement. Great read"
5,Agreed: the best collection of its type,"I seek out music like this, and although I am by no means an expert-- nor do I have an exhaustive collection-- this is still the best one BY FAR. I've got some of the Easy Tempo collection; Cinematic Soul Punch; a few Italian ones; a few other British ones (e.g. Sound Gallery v2 and Sound Spectrum); a couple German ones; the ""TV Dinners"" album; Shake Sauvage and Beretta 70; and some more that I'm forgetting. AND THIS ONE STILL SETS THE CURVE. So check those out, but again, do not miss this one. Unlike other albums which have some hits and some misses, each song on this one is a prize waiting to be discovered. You will not be disappointed."
3,Cheesy lounge pop,"This is a collection of some of the cheesiest 60s pop instrumentals that you can find. However, most of the tunes are punchy enough to qualify as rock lite instead of elevator muzak. The disk was recorded at a low level, so if you mix it into a multi-disk shuffle set it probably won't play as loudly as the other disks (albeit one disk at a time of this kind of music is plenty). Overall, it's amusing but is more suitable for background music than active listening."
1,What a waste of time and money,I agree with the other reviewer about email support. I have emailed them 3 weeks in row asking for an RMA so that I could return the item and have heard nothing from them. I am 99.99% certain that they sent me a used enclosure because the paint was already worn off the assembly screws. I would advise anyone and everyone to shine this enclosure on. I bought an IOMEGA with a 500 BG drive already installed that works like a champ.
4,Love it!,"I am very pleased with this highchair! I pulled it out of the box, removed the cardboard/packing, and it was ready to go. It wipes clean easily and folds up just as advertised. My friends with older kids were really impressed with this space-saver. BRU is showing two patterns...I don't remember the name of my pattern, but it's light green with animals (purchased at Target)."
2,Not That Great,"The only thing a like about this chair is the fact that is very slim when folded, great feature if you have a small dining room. However my little 6-month's arms get stuck in the space between the seat and the chair legs. I'm actually worried that when she is bigger it will be hard for her arm to get unstuck and even get hurt. The other thing is that it doesn't have a rack to hand her bib or washcloth.I regret not paying the extra $30 and get the Chicco instead; it would have been worth it."
4,Fascinating Book!,"If you're at all interested in the Greek language or Greek as it relates to the Bible, you simply must check out this book. Not only do you learn a bit of Greek, but you learn some of the intricacies of Greek word meanings applied to Scripture. I'd studied Greek just a bit a few years ago. It's a difficult language to grasp. Still, the author goes the extra mile to make it as easy to follow as possible. I found myself wishing the author would do even more with his concept. I wished I'd had an audio or video accompaniment to the book that would help me with proper pronunciation. I also wish he'd do a Bible study series, taking perhaps one book of the Bible at a time and helping the layperson understand it better by giving a firmer grasp of the meaning of the word in its Greek form."
1,Not what I expected,"Robben is known for playing a wide range of styles including blues and jazz, but this disc is strictly for those who enjoy improvisational jazz. There is no similarity between this recording and any of the typical blues recordings from Robben's early years or later with the Blue Line. If you enjoy Robben's more typical blues style - or even if you merely expect music to have a melody - you will likely be disappointed with this recording."
3,I agree with Daniel maltzmen.,"I love NIN, and I love the new album, but Trent Reznor, like many successfull musical artists, is a product in the eyes of the record company. trnet has allready made it clear to fans and press alike that he is against the corpoarate interrest to banf NIN fans out of their money. He is also rightfully insulting his recording contract and claiming that they are trying to exploit his artistic interrests for a few more pennies, and alot more hype than he is seeking. If you know Trent, you know that he is brutally honest with the public, and has little to apologize for...so in that regard.....if your a must have collector....buy this. Otherwise, your wasting your time here. Year Zero is epic, but so far the singles are just an avalanche of the haves vrs. the have nots!"
2,not sure,"I found this book as rather doing a disservice to both the reader and the Romanian language. It uses mostly old, formal and awkard forms of conversation, unusual gerundial verb modes (like it's been translated from english!) and a constant choice of using suffixes that distort words making them seem difficult. Overall, it unrealistically pushes the language away from its latin base instead of using that base as common ground for a reader of a different language.I must say however that I have not read other similar courses out there so I could not make a fair comparison.."
1,Very Disappointed,"I sent it back to Amazon for a refund after 2 days. One controller flashed ""E4"" from the first time I plugged it in. The owners manual said this meant the blanket was defective and had to be returned for repair or replacement."
3,vellux heated blanket,"heat is distributed evenly,however the controls are not the bestdoes not shed or pill- that is the good part"
4,Microfine wires?,"I just unpacked this electric blanket. I had to come back to this site to check that I had read something about it having small heating wires... they use the term ""microfine""! HA! They may be soft (for wires), they may be pliable (again, for wires), but they are definately not ""microfine"". It feels like there are 12 gague wires running along in there!On a better note, I plugged it in and it got warm. The boost mode seems to be a very cool feature and everything looks very well made, especially the controls and the plugs. The queen (and king version, I assume) require 2 outlets, unlike the last one we had which joined together and required only 1."
1,Very stiff blanket.,"It does warm. Unfortunately, it is very stiff and ungiving. It tends to slide sideways during the night leaving one of us uncovered. Why it was designed to have two plugs for the separate controls is beyond me. The heating wires are very thick which adds to the stiffness. The placement of the label on the corner of the bed is another mystery. Obviously designed by some one who has never used an electric blanket."
1,Martex Dual Control Queen Heated Blanket,I am in the process of returning it because only one side works.
1,Defective merchandise,"Very shortly after receiving the blanket and installing it on my bed it started having problems. It went from my setting of 12 to a setting of 6 with an E (error) message, and the blanket cooled way down. It did this on 3 consequtive nights when I finally realized there was a potentially unsafe problem and had to returned the blanket. Unfortunately, no replacements were available, so I purchased the same blanket from another source."
1,Utterly Confused,"I am new to ADO.NET and have some working code in my projects, but wanted to know more about ADO.NET. This books has only confused me. I had a better understanding before I read this book."
2,Disappointed after I bought it.,"Last month I searched for an ADO.Net book, I found this book got a full 5 star, I couldn't wait running to a local book store and purchased this title. After I read it, I was disappointed. I recommend another book ""Pragmatic ADO.NET: Data Access for the Internet World"", which is a better title."
2,Not so good as the reviews,"it is a long read. It seems the author dragged the story too much than it was required. I did like some portions of the book, but it dragged forever. Being raised in similar areas was definitely one of the reasons for me reading it to the end. I will not recommend this to anyone."
3,"Good read, but not Ghosh's best","This book kept me up past my bedtime last night, although I found it not entirely convincing. Still, parts were enthralling. Ghosh throws together an American cetacean researcher of Indian descent, a translator from New Delhi, an illiterate fisherman, and the turbulent landscape of the Sundarbans, and comes up with a tale that is part adventure story, part romance, part history and resonates with the hybrid mythology of its location throughout.But while there is much to be savored in this novel, it flounders a bit in describing straightforward adult interactions--people explain themselves (in their thoughts and out loud) rather woodenly.Still, it kept me reading, and I was glad to learn about a part of the world I'd barely even heard of. But I've enjoyed other Ghosh books more."
3,Not his best,In An Antique Land was much better. The setting here is very interesting and well described but the characters were poorly characterized and I found it kind of boring in parts.
5,Amazing novel,This is a fantastic novel with memorable plot and characters. I have read many books by this author and they are all highly recommended. I have just completed the Sea of Poppies. I cannot wait for the other two books in this trilogy.
2,People Please!,"Let's face reality people. Gosh is simply a mediocre writer. The entire time I read this book I felt as if someone was whispering, ""See? You get it? You understand?"" And I would respond, ""Yes, I understand. And what' more, I'm captivated."" And then the voice would go on to explain anyway after I had just told it that I was on the same page with said whispering voice. And I would try to stop the voice from killing the moment, and yet it would continue to restate what I already knew. And then I would get angry and make some empty threats to that irritating voice."
4,Really Interesting Story,"This book will take you to places in India that are hard to imagine. I had no idea such a Tide Country existed. It's not receiving 5 stars only because of a lack of depth to the characters. I hungrily read this story for its insights, the astute and tasteful perfection of Ghosh's writing, the exotic information and the broad sweep of the story, which was a great armature for the information imparted. Really a fascinating book."
4,A Fascinating Setting,"This book transports the reader to a fascinating place, some islands off the East coast of India. There are several intertwined subplots and lots of information about the culture of the region. However, the characters are not fully developed and there are too many of them. I am glad to have read this book as it also raises some important issues about the conflict between the rights of endangered animal species and the needs of dislocated refugees in our overpopulated world."
5,An Enchanting Book,"This is the first novel by Amitav Ghosh that I have read, and I loved it. I felt really comfortable with the characters, especially Piya, the Indian-American cetologist through whose eyes part of the story is told. Since I am also an Indian-American woman (although not a cetologist), I think I really identified with her. Kanai, an educated, urban-oriented translator, is the other main protagonist, and I identified less with him. I loved the descriptions of the islands and scenery. I also loved how the local myth of the goddess Bon Bibi was woven into this story, as well as the history of an attempted utopian community on one of the islands. I loved the tension between Moyna, who is from a poor, uneducated family but is striving for formal education, and her illiterate husband, Fokir, who has educated himself about the tide country and the dolphins, which Piya finds remarkable and valuable."
4,Great atmosphere,"This was my first Amitav Ghosh book, so I didn't know what to expect. As it turned out, I enjoyed the book immensely.I was completely transported to the mysterious Sundarbans, the land of tigers and ever-changing islands -- the ""ragged fringe"" of India. The story itself is quite absorbing and the characters are well developed. He touches upon themes like man's relationship with the river and latent feelings of social class differences that one imagines that one has quelled, but does not appear to be preachy."
5,Great for young kids,"This is a fun game for pre-math children, but anyone of any age can enjoy it. Plays just like Yahtzee but with animals on the dice instead of numbers."
5,Lotti Is Lotti...That Says It All,I am an avid Lotti fan and this is just another perfect example to add to my collection.
5,"warning if you lisen to hip-pop turn off your computer,asap","well if you like eligh than you will have to either buy or at least burn this album ,I burned it but thats cause my boy gave me a copy. But what I'm trying to tell you is that this album is a must have in any true hiphop head collection. I recomend let,s see...track 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Thats all but track 4 is the hardest."
4,Better than the first,"I read the first volume of this story years ago, so I thought it was time to tackle the second one. Of course I thought the second one was better, because the romance between Kleopatra and Antony is always the best part, along with their tragic demise. The author is descriptive and thorough in her writing, yet something was lacking for me which made it have a four star rating. My favorite book of all time is ""The Memoirs of Cleopatra"" by Margaret George, a very lengthy book that covers every aspect of the ancient queen's life. Because I was used to the story of Cleopatra from that tremendous author, I was a little upset that this novel skipped a year, even two of the queen's life in-between chapters. Though the novel had this empty space, I still found it enjoyable and was unable to put it aside during some parts. I will definitely read more from this author."
1,Avoid this Film,"I, too, made the mistake of viewing this film. I really wanted the documentary about the guys that traveled America and visited 38 microbreweries in 40 days. THAT DVD is supposed to be made available early in 2005. Be sure you don't get this other stupid flick by mistake."
1,NOT the documentary,This is NOT the documentary about the American craft brewing industry. That film is being released on DVD on March 29th and can be purchased initially on www.sixhundred.com.
4,Great item--be careful for picture!,"I am writing this review because the item pictured is not what you receive--so be careful about that. The picture (as I write this on 10/17/2012) is for a refillable pack of snap-on proxabrush heads--actually, you get the old-style handle (not the one that accomodates the snap-on replacement heads) and three sample brushes (tight, moderate, wide) that are in the older style where they come on a wire that you bend through the handle. Just make sure you read the description and DO NOT purchase this item based solely on the picture. If you know what you're getting, this is a quality item at a good price."
1,Bad service from Amazon,"I purchased this item and it is supposed to be a ""snap-on"" handle as shown in the picture but that is not what I received. Instead I was given the standard handle. I have written the seller but have no response as of a week. I will never buy from them again. Hopefully Amazon will come through and make good.EXTREMELY disappointed."
3,For the price it is a great deal but this is not the Snap-on head that they show in one of the pics so don't get confused,I bought this with the snap in refills thinking that this was that Proxabrush ( I believe they had a picture showing that when I bought it but it seems to be gone. This comes with 3 wire refills (one of each size) and they are the tapered. The problem with this for me is that I do not have even spaces between all of my teeth and it is a pain to swap out the wired brushes if you want to switch sizes during your routine.I give it 3 stars because it is a good price for an ok product but do not think you are getting the snap in brush.
4,Proxabrush,Been using these for years. I believe that they work a lot better than floss. Only drawback is that you need more than one brush size because of the different gaps between your teeth.
2,Picture is misleading,"This product only comes with 2 refills, which is not specified anywhere. The picture shows several refills. This is misleading."
1,Beware,I ordered a package deal including a Proxabrush handle and two containers of snap-on refills. The handle does NOT accdomodate the refills. Duuuuuuh!
4,Best deal for the money!,"I love the idea that you can disassemble the theater & store it away. Our granddaughters do not live locally, but when they come for a visit we can set up the theater for them. Their imaginations went wild with the theater!"
3,Nice but not sturdy enough,"I have four main problems with this puppet theater:1. It did not come with directions and it took me forever to find them online. Since I was putting it together Christmas Eve for Christmas, this was a big negative;2. The clock comes off too easily. My daughter keeps pulling the clock offf and I have to keep putting it on. Maybe I'm wrong but I feel that M & D should have anticipated this since it is made for children.3. I have to keep tightening the screws on it because they do not stay put. I have to tighten screws on other toys as well but maybe once or twice a year, this has become a biweekly chore; and4. It can tip over when children lean on it, even though it's not supposed to.All of that being said, my daughter loves this puppet theater and plays in it on a regular basis."
2,It's ok but have a deffect,This puppet theater have a deffect in the asambly the wood hole doenn't work with the other parts. i THINK THE TOY IS GREAT BUT FOR THIS REASON I PAY LESS BECAUSE HAVE A DEFFECT.
5,Fun for the entire family!,"What a nice product! I was a bit reluctant base on some of the other reviews about assembly. But there was no problems at all! We have a few Melissa and Doug products (puzzles and smaller toys), next Christmas we will be looking at some of the larger items for make-believe play! It is surprisingly durable and easy to put together. My kids love it and it provides so much enrichment. My young children are working on development of vocabulary and character roles. Purchase this and limit the video games."
4,Nice Theater,"Agh! I feel cheated LOL. I bought this used from Craigslist back when Amazon had it for WELL over 100 bucks and I'm seeing today it's way less than that plus free shipping!Seriously, you can't beat that, you could't even make it for close to that.It's the perfect height for a 2 year old though we bought it prematurely for our DD when she was just over 1 because it was just so cute, nice vivid colors.Only issue is the side curtain walls (not the red curtains on front) are secured with dowels on the base of the unit and if you bump the curtain the dowels are always popping out so we will need to glue them in."
5,Puppet Theater,"I built this so it was ready to use for my granddaughter's birthday. She loves it so much, she carries all over the house giving shows for whoever will listen. It was easy to put together, is well made and very attractive. Good buy! It also arrived in less time than was promissed."
1,"Theater iteslf looks good, but the description states that puppets are included, which seems to be untrue.","For the theater itself, no complaints. It seems sturdy enough, and it certainly went together with no trouble. Cannot yet report on how much the kids like it, as they won't see it until tomorrow morning (Christmas). I fully expect that they will enjoy it greatly.The massive complaint I unfortunately have to include is that the description states that the theater ships with the Kidcraft Princess and Knight puppets, and these were not in fact included with the theater. I am going to try and follow up with Amazon to see what can be done about the missing puppets, and will update the review based on that."
1,Broke within a month,This was cute and easy setup but was broken within the month. Wish it had held up. Cute idea though
5,My daughter loves it!,The imagination of a child is worth a million dollars! Thank you! I love playing with my daughter and her face of happiness is awesome.
2,Very hard to assemble- + Picture doesn't correspond to the product,We bought this for our children this Christmas. It was VERY VERY hard to build when it shouldn't be. Once finished it is a nice toy just be ready for an hour on the assembly! In addition the picture on amazon are not the right pictures of the product.
1,Assembly problems,"Holes were misaligned by over 2 inches on one side and nearly an inch on the foot section. Ordered another, hoping it was just a bad batch. Wood and fabrics were nice and the painted sign and clock were attractive."
4,great product,"We bought this for Christmas. I had purchased a lot of puppets from a friend and thought this would be fun too. Our 3 year old plays with it a little bit. She would rather have me put on a show, but when she has friends over they all want to play with it together. Was easy to put together and looks terrific. Like the clock very much. . . great intro to telling time. Need to be careful if using with multiple children as it can tip over if pushed on. Overall a great product and I would purchase again."
3,Did not hold my interest,"While the setting and the riddle would seem to make for a very good read, I was very disappointed. I knew that I was not making progress in this book when by page 42 it was a chore to read. Somehow I plodded on, but this was one romance that did not spark my interest. Yes, it is well written, yes, the characters are nice. But it lacked the zest and energy that many romance novels possess."
4,A sunny good time!,Whenever I'm feeling blue or in need of sunshine on a rainy day... THIS is the cd I put on. Tons of fun and guraunteed to make you smile.I suspect that the people who DIDN'T like this cd don't have the kind of sense of humor needed to appreciate this album. So very tongue in cheek and just an all around good time. Too bad the art of subtle lyrics is lost on today's artists.
3,Serious Mitchum Fans Only,"While I consider myself a true Mitchum fan and admire much of histalent, this CD was not my personal taste. The limits are withmyself and not Mitchum as he seems to do a good job on allthe songs. The CD was worth the second hand price for the lasttwo songs (which are not Calypso). Again this is my personaltaste but the deep smooth voice of Mitchum is more appealing tome than the lighter Calypso songs."
2,Barely out of the box,"I bought this player for my son to use on overseas flights.I have only used the player five times, and it no longer works. The screen went from shadowy, to black, although all else functions. Very disappointing.Of course, there is a 90 day warranty, but now I will have to deal with a paper and shipping hassle.I don't recommend this model."
2,battery is Achille's heel,"Except for the low volume output (forget about using two headsets with a splitter), I think this is a very capable player. Unfortunately, unless you're always going to plug it into the wall while viewing, save your money. I've watched a total of 6 movies using the battery and during the last one the screen went dead after an hour. Turning the brightness down to its lowest setting only extended the battery life to an hour and 15 minutes. So much for being a ""portable"" DVD player. Let's see: $48 per movie...do you think I feel cheated by Audiovox"
3,"Good performance, bad battery, awful customer service","I have the private-labeled ""Eddie Bauer"" version of this unit and it plays exactly 5 minutes on battery. Once private labeled, no one, including Audiovox, has any information on the unit so that I can replace the battery. Customer service at Audiovox is atrocious; consequently I will avoid their products at all costs in the future. I think the unit was shipped with an alkaline battery, notorious for developing discharge memory. Replacing with a high amp-hour lithium ion battery will eliminate this problem... assuming I can figure out which battery fits the unit. Truly, companies like Audiovox are subscribing to the throw-away economy where products are assumed to be obsolete immediately on release and little is done to take care of customers down the road. Too bad."
1,Dead battery,"My unit works only plugged, so the battery is dead. Now I have to either get a replacement batery or buy a new unit (certainly not an Audiovox). Even when the battery worked, the recharging time was around 8 hours, so it was good for one movie. I am thinking on Panasonic as reviews in general are good."
4,The best toy I've ever had!,"I have owned my Audiovox D1705 for a little over two months. I am constantly pleased with it's performance. I'd just like to pass on a couple of tricks and advice. The owner's manual thatcomes with it is very poorly written. If you want the optimum battery life, drain the battery completly before each re-charge.To use the power saving mode switch. (Number 26 in the owners manual.) You only have to press pause and partially close the machine to disengage the button. This will cause the screen to darken and save power. No need to turn the machine off each time you get interrupted. ( I'ts run up to five hours when I've paused it in this manner.)Audiovox customer service is very slow, and less than helpful in most cases. I purchased a back-up battery since I use my dvd player so often. I had it shipped 2nd day air. It took a month to arrive. Be prepared."
4,Something different......,"When I first heard Crystal Lewis was going to have a Christmas album, I was excited. SO, I went and bought it as soon as it was released. I was a little disappointed when I heard it and it was all loungy-type jazz arrangements. Her performance is not very powerhouse, as most of us are accustomed too, but mostly laid back easy listening, which is good, If you like that. It is definitely not classic Crystal Lewis. There are several good songs, but it sounded like a good background music CD to me. I was mostly disapointed with the rendition of Oh HOly Night, which was very soft. I'm glad that I bought the cd, I wouldn't take it back. It was just different, and will definitely take getting used to. So, if this is your taste, go for it........."
5,A must for anyone!,"An amazing album! Crystal sings all the good Christmas songs on this one. But she takes a little different aproach this time. She sounds a lot like Ella Fitzgerald, giving this fantastic album a great jazz sound. And her three piece backup band does an excellent job. I would buy this album for everyone I knew, if I could afford it."
3,Felt a little like the day after Christmas.........,"I see from the other comments I wasn't alone in feeling a bit letdown.While it's a nice CD, I think it's evident not much time was spent on preparing it, ""IMHO"" (I don't know if it was budget or time limit) Anyway, it was a basic same style throughout all the songs. I too would have liked varied instruments and exuberant singing! Maybe even a background choir on one of the songs.BUT the reason I still say this is a nice CD, is because Crystal has a absolutely beautiful voice and it's great to hear her on Christmas songs. So I still recommend this CD for your collection, whether you're a fan of hers, a Christmas music collector, or are trying her music for the first time.While there's nothing ""TA-DA!"" about the CD,(oh how I was expecting and hoping it to be!) this will be totally perfect for those Christmas season hours when you want to reflect or just have a calm moment to yourself or with others."
5,Crystal & Jazz trio hit a Home Run,"I have listened to this album during Christmas seasons for years now. Although Crystal sings with only a trio, each song is intrically woven together by 4 incredibly talented musicians. Don't be frightened away from the Jazz label or the Christian label. For her long time fans, Crystal puts her other familiar genres aside, like hip-hop, spanish, R&B, rock and the others; and Crystal's powerful voice is a bit softened here compared to her other power-house vocalizations. I would have to describe this effort as warm, charming and cozy. These Holiday standards sung by Miss Lewis will carry you right into the Christmas holiday spirit. Each song is catchy. If I had to single out a favorite it would be ""Go Tell It on a Mountain."" Looking forward to her newest holiday album. Cyrstal if you're out there, thanks again!!!"
5,MINDBLOWING,"This has got to be one of my all-time favorite CDs. Well produced, incredibly diverse, ingenious compilations, and SUCH heart! It is a terriffic CD."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Eisenstein's directorial flourishes are in full display in Strike, but it's slow and lacking the intensity that makes Battleship Potemkin so watchable; as a historical artifact Strike is valuable but as a film it's forgettable."
1,What's up with this?,I ordered this item in November 2004. Amazon requested extension after extension for seven months then cancelled the order in mid-June 2005. But it's still on the web site and supposedly available in 1-2 weeks. Hmmmm.
1,no extension cord,"If you are buying this to attach to another mat, it will not work beccause it does't come with the cord it is supposed to. If you go to the Petsafe site it shows the cord."
1,"5 Star Book, 1 Star Seller","I highly reccommend a Pig Named Perrier. It is a fun, silly story with a charming plotline and lovely illustrations, which makes it one our favorite bedtime reads! We love this book so much, in fact, I purchased it ""NEW"" to give as a gift. The book arrived in less than new condition. Our 3 year old copy of ""A Pig Named Perrier"" is in better condition than the ""NEW"" book that was mailed to me from this seller. Also, the book jacket is missing!!! It would be an utter embarrassment to give this book as a gift considering the condition it was in. What a waste."
5,Great product,"I've been using this for a few years now and I just love it. It's light enough that it doesn't feel like you are wearing anything, yet I've had no problems with dry skin since I started using it. I've tried many other products before this and have not been this satisfied with anything. I can't say my wrinkles have disappeared, but I definitely think the fine lines are less visible. My local store stopped carrying this product, so I hope they are not phasing it out!"
5,Mum loves it,My mum is a big fan of the Regenerist series so bought it for her as a gift. It arrived quickly in good shape.Saved $3 with Amazon coupon as well. I recommend regular shoppers sign up for the coupon newsletters. :)
3,Too oily!,"I just didn't like the feel of this product. I'm really sensitive to oily moisturizers in terms of how they make me feel. Although this did a good job in moisturizing, it left my skin and hands shiny, to the point where after putting it on, touching a doorknob would make the doorknob oily. If you don't mind a moisturizer that is a bit greasy, this is the way to go! The greasiness is probably due to the sunscreen in it."
3,Olay Regenerist Lotion,"I was very excited when I found Olay Regenerist on Amazon for $10.00 as it tends to be a bit spendy. Same size bottle, 2.5 ounces is $30 at Costco. Alas, when I received it the first thing I checked for was the expiration date. It will expire 6 months from the date I received in mail. Hopefully procuct is still worthwhile until expiration date. I have used this product before and will continue to use. Albeit, the expiration is nearing, it still seems to be doing a fine job. My skin is silky smooth and I do not need to buy eye cream as this seems to work great. So, buyer beware for future purchases of face products. They have expiration dates. I wonder if this should be disclosed before selling? So we are not duped."
4,A Gentle Sunscreen,"This product is an excellent source of texture refinement, sunscreen and moisture. I actually prefer a stronger SPF, so I use the regular Regenerist Regenerating Serum and add a stronger sunscreen."
5,A great buy!,"A good face cream, and a good price. Goes on easily, and is not greasy. I would highly recommend this face cream."
3,olay regenerist lotion withUV,"It is pretty much same product that used to be in larger bottle for about $6. They have just given a new name""Regenerating lotion"", placed it in a smaller bottle and increased the price."
2,Sensitive Skin?,"I had the EXACT same reaction another reviewer posted. It was only in the jawline area, towards my lips and kind of itchy. The product I am using is the ""UV Defense Regenerating Lotion spg 15"" ordered from this site. I was surprised since I have NEVER had an allergic reaction to any lotion before. Then I realized that Olay's quench body moisturizer sometimes made my legs sting. It might be this line of products or my skin is more sensitive than I thought. I gave it two stars because it did feel nice on my skin, at first (for winter-skin- however, skin BEWARE :)."
3,"""OK"" product","I bought this product mainly because of the UV protection. I wanted a moisturizer that was light on the skin, something that wouldn't clog my pores.This product goes on light, which is great. Many people like products that smell good/fresh. I personally don't like to wear fragrances of any kind. This has a strong powdery smell that lingers for about an hour or two.I didn't notice an improvement in my skin. It didn't give me that supple, young look. It made me break out a bit.I am sticking to a product I have been using for several years now and it's wonderful! It's unbelievably amazing for getting rid of acne. It's a hundred times better than ProActiv, which stops working on your skin after a few months of use. It makes my skin look so young. Here is the link in case you're interested:Mary Kay Velocity Cleanser and Moisturizer[...]"
3,"good, but not for me","I bought this product based on a BBC documentary about products that really work in reducing fine lines. Thankfully I have few lines, but figured it was good to get on top of the game, and I also liked the fact that it offered UV protection which is the number one reason for getting lines in the first place.I like the way it dispenses and feels on my skin at first, but I noticed that it does not get absorbed quickly enough for me. I consistently sweat the stuff off after applying it. I think it's just too greasy and thick for me. I usually have dry skin, so you would think it would be perfect, ...I will finish what I have of it and then go back to my Boots No.7 Protect & Perfect."
1,received an 'About To Expire' item,"received an 'About To Expire' item.. just one month remaining, no tracking provided and arrived all of a sudden (but on time)."
1,I have bumps all over ew,This product its not all that great when u start using it it feels nice but after a while my face started getting bumps and the smells was disgusting......I recently started using mary kay wow what a difference and wayyy cheaper! bye bye olay!
3,Daily moisturizer,I am not as happy with Olay Regenerist Regenerating Lotion for daytime as I am with the night cream. I just don't feel I get the good results I get with the night cream.
3,Like the serum version better,"Unfortunately, I didn't realize that there is a serum AND a lotion version of this product. Not paying attention, I ordered this because it was 2.5oz versus the 1.7oz size. I do not care for the lotion version. My skin feels greasy like I put body lotion on it and I can only stand to wear it at night. Unless you have dry skin, I do not recommend the lotion version. My skin felt much better with the serum-I have combination skin. Hopefully, I will get the same fantastic results I had with the serum."
4,I messed up,"I wanted the SPF 50 version, but I guess I didn't read the details closely enough. But I am sure the moisturizing of this product is good enough. It would be nice if Amazon were to put the SPF # on the title of the product. ""UV Protection"" doesn't say much. How about ""SPF whatever #"" on the title of the product?"
3,strong fragrance,"I bought this daily moisturizer along with the eye serum, face serum and and night cream. I generally use Loreal daily moisturizer but figured I'd try all of the Olay Regenerist products. The first thing I noticed is that Olay is thicker than Loreal. The second thing is the fragrance. Loreal has a nice, light lemony scent. Olay's scent is much stronger and floral. I've only been using it for about a week so I can't really judge the effects. However, I am a little turned off by the scent.Update: I've gotten used to the thickness and scent. I think I still prefer the Loreal but this is a good everyday moisturizer. I've definitely noticed an improvement in my skin since using the Regenerist line."
4,AMAZING ... but...,"This item is amazing, it really does make skin appear more youthful while it protects from future damage. it is very soothing on the skin. The only down side is due to the built in sunscreen of the product, it can make your skin appear oily by the end of the day. If you buy this product i recommend using a small amount in the morning so as to keep from the excess pooling on your skin."
2,My Skin was on Fire,"I saw this item mentioned in a Real Simple article. After repeated admonishments to use sunblock, I thought I would multi-task and get sunblock action while taking care of some hyper-pigmentation issues.Huge mistake. By the second application, my skin felt like it was on fire. I'm an African-American woman in my 30's who used to enjoy monthly facials. With two years of monthly facials, my skin was never as red as when I tried to use this product. I'm the same tone as Morris Chestnut. Trust me when I say it takes quite a bit to turn my skin red enough that co-workers were asking if I had a temperature."
5,Road to Agra,"This was my favorite book as a child. I told a friend about it, and that I could no longer find it in the library, and she ordered me a used copy from Amazon.com. I read it to my son's 5th grade class and they all loved it too. It has a timeless quality, and transports kids to India's sights, colors, and fragrances, through the journey of two children. I would recommend it to parents and kids!"
1,Broke after 4 uses,I purchased this unit. While it worked it did a good job but it broke within 3 weeks. I only emptied the bucket 4 times. Very disappointing.
1,garbage product and producer,"I will let the accounts of the many dissatisfied Haier victims stand for themselves. Yes, haier produces junk. I will add this; they don't honor their warranty obligations, and if their customer service weren't a run-around, it would be non-existent. My Haier dehumidifirer died before its warranty period was up, and I followed Haier's instructions for intiating a warranty replacement. It has been a month since they received the package of items they requested, and they still haven't shipped a new unit. Delay, ""escalation"", delay, ""escalation to corporate"", etc., and still no action. Don't buy Haier"
1,Not worth the time,Do not buy this product. We bought one and it didn't even turn on. Manufacturer wanted $15 just to ship us a new one...when it was their problem. Don't bother with them or the product.
4,Tiki Party Music,This has always been regarded as one of those must have CDs if you ever wanted to throw a Tiki theme party or want to enjoy some memories of years past. It really is that good and worth having........even goes with Margaritas!
5,brought back memories,This was so great to find. I bought it for my brothers xmas gift.He was astounded that I found it and soo happy.Brought back lots of memories of our youth.thank you
3,Tiki bar music,"The ""Quiet Village"" track is justifiably famous. It evokes the Eisenhower era of prosperity laden Americans visiting Hawaii-or at least their brand new high fidelity record players while mixing some exotic drinks with little umbrellas in them. I like some of this. Two albums worth is a bit much, though. After a while, I felt as if I was trapped in a cheesy Tiki bar. Too many numbers that sound like ersatz polynesian/oriental music-as filtered through the ears of returning G.I.'s. A little of this goes a long way. May be essential if you grew up hearing your parents (or grandparents) playing this at cocktail parties or if you need a complete lounge music collection. Worth one or two listens."
1,The Immoral One,The uncut version was on cable about 20 years ago. One of the best and hottest scenes in the movie has been edited out of this video. It is advertised on the box as 90 minutes. The tape has 75 minutes on it. The best scenes deleted.
3,Good summery to avalanche,"If you have already some knowledge about the subject, it's a good and fast way to review it.Using this book maybe give you enough information, to alert you about danger.As with some other books which give you a lot of information, when you got too much information, finally it become difficult to decide and maybe your most important information is lost between all these details.Small book, which can be read really fast."
4,Great book,"This is a slim, smallish book (only 47 pages) but well worth the money if you're a costume buff. The dresses are really lovely and the informtion, basic but well presented and helpful.Not a book to educate you on C18th clothing as such, but a great sneak peak into it with some nice closeups and good photographs of some beautiful clothing.All photographs and a couple of portraits, but otherwise no illustration. It's simply a catalogue book of the C18th costumes held by National Museums Liverpool, which is all it claims to be.A helpful addition to anyones library who's interested in costuming or costume history and definatly worth the money if you love this type of thing."
4,I don't like much Tiamat but this rocks,"The first I had heard of Tiamat was their newer material (i.e., Judas Christ), which I was not impressed with. But I found a video for ""Whatever That Hurts"" (very good song) on launch.com and it sold me to buy this CD. It's overall pretty good, but the aforementioned track is still my favorite. I don't like Johan's vocals, but other than that, I can't say there's really any problem. The instruments are played with skillful simplicity, if you will; there's not a whole lot of speed or technicality involved, but the band members know what they're doing. You get a lot of music for your money, too, which is something bands should really consider doing more often. Anyway, this is a great CD for people who are new to the band, but if you're a longtime Tiamat fan, chances are you already have it."
4,"Works well, but don't forget to turn it off","This thermometer works well, it reads fairly quickly, and it has given me no reason to question it's accuracy.But for whatever reason, in a world of electronic devices with momentary on switches and time-out features, this one has a single-throw lever switch. On is on, and off is off, with no embedded idle-detect program in between.To compound this it's fairly easy to turn it on accidentally, however, in its defense, the first battery is still going strong, despite my having inadvertently left it powered-on in a drawer for days on end.I should also note that it came with an extra battery, so at this time the power arrangement is a non-issue for me... it's just a little different than many things of this nature.Addendum: It's now 4 1/2 years later, I use this all the time, I've had to buy batteries for it once. Still very pleased."
4,Fast,Fast and easy to read. I'm a little worried about liquid or food eventually getting in around the openings for the slide switches. It would be 5 stars if it were sealed.
2,Broke After Less Than A Year,"I have purchased this for myself and a few family members as gifts. I use it to take the temperature of meat and also homemade bread. I have had to replace the battery on one of them, but this latest one I bought broke after less than a year's use. I thought it was the battery, but after I took it to a battery shop, the battery was tested and was fine. So the unit itself doesn't work. Now I have to fork out another $11 if I want a food thermometer."
1,Not!,"Not an ""instant read"" thermometer. Should be described as a digital thermometer instead. Inexpensive cost and inexpensive construction not worth owning if you are serious about cooking and need precise and instant information."
1,defective,"The C/F range button would not stay in the F position, so rather than convert all my cooking to centigrade, I returned it for a refund. Amazon handled that process very nicely. At least it was not like a similar Taylor model I had returned to Target last yeat; that one even came with a replacement battery, but the original one was epoxied into place and unremovable! I have purcahsed a Polder unit and a large yellow Taylor from Amazon as replacements, and they both seem to work fine."
3,fast thermometer,"When my husband ordered this meat thermometer I thought that you could use it to check steaks on the grill. Unfortunately, it is like most thermometers of that kind where it must be inserted at least an inch into the meat for an accurate temperature. It is quick but don't forget to turn it off as it is battery operated!"
3,Healthy Living,"I did not follow this like I should But I like book and love to read , I'an sure I still do some of it yet."
2,Very Disippointing,"I guess I thought I could follow Dr. Fifes advice on a good diet since I'm on board with the coconut oil thing however I was disappointed, no, make that thoroughly unhappy. The book gets two stars because of the coconut info which I still agree with. I was lookong for a way to heal my stomach woes and this just didn't cut it. Plus I really hate the cover! I've moved on to the strict Paleo way of living for the past three months and I am beginning to feel better. With more modification (implementing Fodmaps), I am more energetic and adding more exercise. The bottom line on this book is that coconut oil is not the cure all and the diet still relies on processed foods and sugar."
3,Interesting but not what I thought it would be,"I expected that this would be more of a diet plan and for that reason I was a little disappointed with it. The coconut oil unfortunately does not agree with me. I had a difficult time processing so much fat in my diet. Just me, I'm sure it works well for others."
4,"510 Bed Rail Round 48""(4 feet)","I bought the product assuming it will be exactly 48"" in length. Unfortunatly the ad. is very deceptive. It measures 40 inches center to center of the securing bolt and 44 inches edge to edge of the rail. Please measure your truck bed before you order , because you want your wheel fender wel to be in the center to look good especialy if you have a tool box. Quality wise , it is too early to tell. Finishing is good. If I had a chance to do it over , I will buy a stainless steel instead of chrome. I hope it helps you guys in your decision making process. Thanks."
1,"There Are Better, Supported, Alternatives","Simply put, the manufacturer of this product shows no interest in upgrading it to be compatible with the latest copyright protection software. I own a laptop with a large hard drive, and I purchased this product so that I would not have to haul all of my game CDs around with me. Of the games I play regularly, only one was supported by GameDrive. Actually, Neverwinter Nights also worked fine until it was upgraded to the Shadows of Undrentide expansion, as well. I reported the incompatibility to the manufacturer in May, and was told a fix was coming ""in the next few weeks."" It is now nearly December.Do yourself a favor and head over to www.alcoholsoftware.com instead of wasting your money on this package. Alcohol 52% has been absolutely flawless for me."
2,No Upgrade Options (VirtualDrive/GameDrive),"This is a review of Farstone's VirtualDrive (identical to Farstone's GameDrive). I have two key complaints about this product.First, the company doesn't offer any reasonable upgrade options. I purchased version 7 almost exactly five months ago and the only option available to upgrade to version 8 is to purchase the product again at full price.Second, the product is not compatible with the copy protection used with the Hoyle 2004 games. Farstone says they're working on a fix, which will be available using Live Update. Of course, the version I have doesn't support Live Update - I'll need to upgrade to version 8 to get this feature (see paragraph above).On the plus side, this product does work with SimCity 3000, Crazy Taxi, Warcraft BNE, and older Hoyle games. However, the problems above pretty much kill this product as far as I'm concerned. I'll look for an alternative product instead of purchasing version 8."
2,BEWARE INCOMPATIBILITIES,"As another reviewer said, the makers of GameDrive do not publish a comprehensive list of compatible games, and this is a big problem. I have found that GameDrive does not work with my three current favorites: Freelancer, Splinter Cell, and Morrowind. However, I have found that it does work with Neverwinter Nights and Warcraft 3. But the point is that you won't know until you try. The manufacturer claims that GameDrive is compatible with the SafeDisc2 protection scheme (used on newer titles), but I have my doubts.Other than the incompatibility problems, the product works as advertised. It's simple, easy to use, and as far as I can tell, solid. Now if only Farstone would become a real company and update their product like they're supposed to."
3,"Eh, it could be worse.","With an average system, any boost you get in performance will be negated by the system resources this thing uses. An associate got this for the only reason it's good: not paying for games.If you're loking to share that copy of a game, this is a good utility. We had few problems with it - none of which were not overcome. I have better things to use my HD space for."
5,Works Just fine!,"I'm using XP pro and I have successfully used this with FREELANCER, DUNGEON SIEGE, and NEVERWINTER NIGHTS. I can't understand why others haven't had the same success. Maybe these people just need to READ THE FREAKING DOCUMENTATION!! When making a VCD of freelancer the only change I had to make (as it says in the docs) was to ""use intellegent extraction"". So far its worked wonderfully... best thing I've bought lately."
1,GameDrive 8 by FarStone,"Since I travel quite a lot, I purchased GameDrive8 to avoid the burden and risk of carrying a dozen+ CDs. I consider myself a savvy computer user---Ph.D. in engineering from MIT---still, after reading the manual and online information, I finally gave up getting this program to run. There is no product support for GameDrive: all of my 14 emails were answered by the same form response. What a joke! Please save yourself the frustration and $35, and try Alcohol 52%. It has done everything I needed it to do, easily and flawlessly."
3,Interesting in parts,"It was nice to see John Thaw in this programme as I forgot about this programme from 1989,it was interesting the way it was done going through each month and what was happening to them each month of the year with other peoples little stories as well,suppose it would of been better in my opinion and confusing when some french was spoken throughout the whole dvd by certain french people and it threw me what was going on sometimes,at times I found it dragged a bit,some might like it better than me,it was funny in parts as well..."
3,It was okay. :|,"this soundtrack was ok. i liked that the lyrics were in english but i cant find the english version anywhere. i liked this CD for relaxing background music but its not real dancing music. i used this more my yoga and relaxation. it really works well. but i think before you buy this you should make sure you like it by buying or borrowing the anime TV series first. but before you buy that you HAVE TO-HAVE TO read the books. the books are the best!! ever. i mean it. i really loved them. but anyways, this music is good!!! 3 out of 5 stars. * * *toodles"
3,Lyrics not in English!,"Only the first and last tracks have lyrics and they're sung in Japanese, not the English used in the anime available in the US. The rest of the tracks are instrumental only. I was disappointed that the english versions weren't included."
1,Don't Buy Funk Fans!!!!,"This is not the funk/Jazz band from Oregon (Bouncy Lady, Glide etc etc)... you''ll be disappointed and out of money buying this garbage unless you like techno. Poorly described item...you might think that Amazon would look into this: NOT!!!!"
4,Power-to-weight ratio,"This is a very powerful saw for the weight. A comparable Stihl is about 50% heavier and when you have a lot of wood to cut the lighter weight is worth the extra money. The saw has served me well cutting up many > 30"" oak, maple and ash trunks and lots of smaller trees and fallen timber. The chain oil dispenser is leaking a bit but the saw has also been used extremely hard for several seasons. I have worn out 4 or 5 chains already and I have switched to a carbide tip chain (Really worth its hefty price!)The saw looks really beat up but still starts on the first pull and runs like a champ. Only complaint: woodchips and sawdust packs inside the safety brake housing and can interfere with smooth running so it needs to be taken apart and cleaned out regularly.This saw is a serious tool in the class of the midsize Husqvarna and Stihl."
5,Making Lumber with Makita 6401 in Alaska on M5 Logosol Mill,"Length:: 8:06 MinsVideo of my stock Makita 6401 cutting lumber this winter in Alaska at -18 degrees on my Logosol M5 sawmill. Very nice saw with plenty of power for cutting. I had to double the speed of the video to fit in Amazon review specs so its 2x speed. Its been a great powerhead for my sawmill, have a Stihl ms660 but prefer to use the Makita."
5,My 2nd Dolmar made chainsaw,"As you can tell from the other reviews, the MAKITA DCS6401 is a great saw. Made by Dolmar for Makita, it is mechanically the same as DOLMAR PS-6400. Before this one I bought a smaller Dolmar PS-5100S that I've been happy with. Now I generally leave the older, smaller saw for my wife or teenagers to use as I prefer this saw. One of the neat things about it that I have not seen mentioned in the other reviews is that you can install an aftermarket BIG BORE kit on it, which provides even more power. I intend to do that with mine when the cylinder eventually wears out."
1,Horrible binding,"When I received this book, the binding was broken and it looked like it was printed from a printer with poor quality paper. I sent it back and asked for a new one. When I received the next one, it also poor quality printing but the binding was not broken. During the first reading of the book, pages fell out and the binding broke. I will never buy from this store again."
5,Entranced my fourth grader,"This fantastic collection of poems explains the structure for many poetic forms, providing examples of each. My fourth grader read it through and found it fascinating and inspiring. She is now writing her own poetry. I also found the book educational and interesting. A superb book."
2,poor design could have been better,"Great price, does the job but it could have been better. You have to hard mount it to a doorway, not what I had expected. Also, the threads screw in the same direction which makes tightening a pain. If it was counter done, you could have used your weight to make the bar tighten against the doorframe. It makes so much sense that it frustrates me when people get the easy things wrong."
4,Great woman serves a great God.,"What this woman accomplished in Taiwan in a lifetime is truly amazing. As you read the book, you will be challenged by her simple faith in a big God. You will also learn some of the history of Taiwan as you learn to love her people. If you enjoy reading stories of inspiring people, this is one you won't want to miss."
4,World Traveler,"This is a great unit for the price. I've watched 2 DVD's while on a flight using battery power. The picture and sound are clear and the unit is very user friendly. I also hooked up our video camera and game counsel to it. This unit is a blast with all the options. I have not used the car adapter yet, but I'm glad it is there. I held off on giving it a 5 only because I would have liked a larger screen, and the unit is thicker than the others. It doesn't fit well in the Targus DVD case very well. I'd recomendd getting all the stuff you want to cary with it, headphones and DVD's and trying out the fit at a camera shop. I eneded up using a video camera bag and it all fits fine. If you are a frequent flyer I highly recomend Noise Canceling headsets, I'm sure Amazon has some for you to chose. Over all, a great little item."
2,Good at first...until the Battery BURNED and MELTED,This thing could have burned my 3 year old...the bottom got so hot just by watching movies that the battery burned and melted on the bottom after turning it off one night. It stuck to the blanket and could have started a fire...talk about defective product!!!!!!
2,Freezes up A LOT!!!,"I was initially very satisfied with this product but within the first week it began freezing up on a VERY regular basis, and often within the first ten minutes of use. In order to try again, I have to turn it off, unplug it, remove the disk, and try it again in a few minutes."
2,ATTENTION,"this player is cool the way it looks and all,but the picture is rather not good!!the picture of it is all white-ish and it is extremely hard to read small words on the screen!well the only reason im rating it 2 stars instead of 1 is because of its sound and design.take my advice,DON""T BUY!!"
1,"""Junk"" ... guess that is why it is discontinued","I bought this Audiovox Model D1500A a little over (4) months ago, and it has now taken a giant ""dump !"" Heck of a note that a DVD player will not even last for the full year of warranty. I have sent Amazon a letter concerning this, and am awaiting a reply from them on coverage. Sorry, but I don't have the patience for the ""old run around"" from the Audiovox warranty department. I will wait and see how this claim works out before slamming Audiovox as a company. However, I would not buy the Model D1500A regardless of how low the price goes. I was told the drive is made of plastic, and when trying to view a movie, the scenes just freeze, or lock up. Guess it is plastic after all ..."
1,be aware,"My issue with this product is that not all the jars have the same texture and consistency, what makes me wonder, some are fresh, and some are not... some jars had the spinach smooth, some other jars had it dry and ""stiff"". I want to make sure that what I give to my baby is good and fresh. This product did not convinced me 100%. I have to say I am happy with the squash, peas, among others."
4,Grew on my daughter.,"At first my daughter didn't like this very much, but now she gobbles it up! Pretty runny, so adding cereal or rice is a must."
5,Just three ingredients,"I love that this baby food is just three simple ingredients: organic green beans, water, and organic brown rice. Some of the Earth's Best varieties contain a lot of fruit in order to make them sweeter, but this one does not. My baby loves the flavor and always finishes the entire jar in one sitting."
5,cool cd,what a great cd! excellent swing guitarist with a hot harmonica. Canada's version of the Hollywood Fats band!
2,A Sting in the Tale,Poorly written and not really much of an insight into Sting as a person. A few funny stories but generally a bit dull and self indulgent
3,Commercial things about Sting,"Be carefull this book is the same book as ""Sting and I - A totalary Hilariousstory......""Not very interesting.....but very Funny."
1,A total waste of time and money,"This book is not a true biography about Sting, nor is it well-written. I can only imagine the endorsement from the subject himself is a misguided attempt to help out an old friend."
1,VERY OUTDATED VIDEO,"FIRST OFF THE PICTURE QUALITY IS HORRIBLE!!!! I COULD HARDLY SEE WHAT THEY WERE EVEN DOING. I BOUGHT A USED ""LIKE NEW"" AND AT BEST I WOULD ONLY CONSIDER THIS DISC AND COVER ACCEPTABLE. ALSO, THE DVD COVER IS DIFFERENT. IT LOOKS LIKE A BAD FADED COMPUTER REPRINT THAT HAS BEEN LEFT OUT IN THE SUN. ALSO, THEY HAD THE NERVE TO CHARGE ME $30 BUCKS FOR IT.COULD THIS BE A BOOTLEG COPY? Hmmmm"
4,"Good for the price, some defects and issues","One of the eggs came apart at the seam, which I was not happy about since I use them with babies and toddlers (luckily it happened at home, not with them), and many of them had lots of sticky residue from a little label that they came with. But other than that, they are good little egg shakers for the price I paid."
1,not a chess puzzle book in my defition,"i like chess puzzle books ... but i think a chess puzzle should have one answer, period ... not three or four first moves that result in three or four moves for each of those moves and so on until it's a game analysis and not just something you can pick up, look at, run thru your head, and get off the pot ...this is one of those books with a ton of different solutions ... this is not a chess puzzle book to me ... sorry perhaps that's not a traditional definition but as i said, it's my definition ...i also want a puzzle book that i can use with my elementary school students ... no way is this book useful to lower level players in any way ... they are confused enough about the myriad of moves available on every move ... they don't need chess puzzles that say 'white to move and win in one' and then have three or four different moves that accomplish that ... when it's a two move puzzle it makes the matter pointless for students at this level"
1,Disappointing,This is obviously a cheap imitation of the real Beaver and likely from some cheap factory in China because not only is not nearly as powerful but makes such an obnoxious mechanical noise that it's distracting. Should've sent it back but kind of a hard product to do that with! Don't waste your money on this. Cough up a few more bucks and buy a better manufactured Beaver which normally is awesome.
4,Mmmmmmmm,"Listening to this, I discovered one of the most beautiful songs I ever heard: Step into this room and dance for me. The tension bilds, seems like wanting to burst out of the speakers but instead it is released very slow very calm, step by step, while the hair on my arms raises higher and higher. Also a masterpiece: Hands up I love you: give it a few listenings and you will discover! Tip: go and sit very close to the speakers and you'll hear things you haven't heard before. But don't put it too loud, you'll ruin the sphere that way! The rest is very various: some very strong rocknumbers but at the end the songs become more soft. Maybe a bit boring. Sister for instance is nothing but boring and ""Only when you're gone"" is good but it lasts too long, in the end it is leading nowhere and you begin to wonder when it's finally going to stop. Nevertheless: good CD, but when it's nearing the end: keep your finger at the skip-button!"
5,Relaxing and mature rockmusic,"Wow, this cd and this band from Norway are really an experience and worth listening to. This is very mature and relaxing rock or popmusic, with excellent melodies, great musicianship and beautiful singing. Some songs remind me of seventies bands like the Doors or the Velvet Underground (or even Sonic Youth), but the most songs are something more laid-back. Some people say that the voice of the singer sounds a bit like Nick Cave or Leonard Cohen, and indeed it does: the singer has a beautiful voice, dark, deep, yet warm and relaxing. Others say that the music sounds a bit like nineties bands like Grandaddy or Sparklehorse, and as far as I know those bands, it does quite a bit.This is one of the best cd's I've listened to the last couple of years, and every fan of the more mature popmusic of last couple of years, like Sparklehorse, Tindersticks or 16 Horsepower, should really try this - I know that a lot of people would like this!"
2,"IMHO, not that good.","This album by Moonspell is one of the most over-hyped things I have heard since Nine Inch Nails' ""The Fragile."" The only three songs I seem to like from this album are ""Alma Mater"", ""Vampiria"" and ""Lua D'inverno"". The rest sounds as if the drones of a distant amusement park. Better buy this album's follow up, ""Irreligious"" or ""Hermeticum"" from Fernando's side project ""Daemonarch"", which is a return to the more primitive and raw beginnings of Moonspell."
5,Extra Tracks?,"I have the original Wolfheart CD from a few years back. Alternate cover, the whole nine yards. I picked this up because I heard it has extra tracks. It does not. Alma Mater which is the track that is in question is available on my previous version, and on the new one. It is only a cover change from what I can tell.Other than that, buy this album. One of the firt Black/Goth Metal bands that really gave me the chill up the spine to listen to."
5,Amazing goth/metal landscapes,"WOLFHEART blew me away the moment I listened to it. The band's music is a dark, beautiful blend of metal and standard gothic music. The album's well-written lyrics focus on dark themes (werewolves, vampires, wicca, etc.) and the music maintains the eerie mood throughout."
3,Don't mind the past,"This is to me, the real first Moonspell's album. The past is too dark and too noisy, so as a fan of more gothic environments, I heard their great album ""Sin/Pecado"", then I had to go buy the brilliant masterpiece ""Irreligious"", and finally I went looking for this ""Wolfheart""... I have to admit that this was the worst of the three, but it still is a good album. ""Wolfheart"" has lots of folchloric influences, and lots of Portuguese lyrics, which brings some surprise to the music, but the vocals lack the power of ""Irreligious"", and the music sometimes isn't fluid and clean. It lacks the gothic mood of their 2 most recent albuns, but as I said it has folchlore so it is still pretty original. Listen to songs like ""Love crimes"" or ""Vampiria"" and you will be convinced that the band had a lot more to give (and it gave in fact!) ""Wolfheart"" is a good work that you can search for if you like dark metal... It's not so great for the gothic fans... The exact rating to me is a 3 1/2"
3,"Good, but not their best...","I've been listening Moonspell for almost 4 years now, and I think this record is this bands' most overrated album. Some riffs are too predictable, some songs are too long and the production is somewhat raw ( bear in mind that they're not Darkthrone ). Also, Fernando Ribeiro's ""clean"" vocals ( or Langsuyar if you prefer ) aren't as great as on their ( Moonspell's ) other Century Media releases. A good album, yes; but not their BEST album..."
4,"4,5 stars Amazing album",This album is one of the best in the gothic scene. Besides its age it stands so well that you will sure like it. All songs are great and the sound is fantastic.if you want <<gothic feelings>> then this album is for you.
5,My kid likes it,"Our daughter came to us at age seven after a long time in fostercare. It is hard to find a book that describes this type of adoption to children and although this book is also about a child adopted as a baby, our little girl loves it. She brings it out and asks us to read it to her often and it usually gets her talking about her birth parents, which is a good thing. It is important for children to know and accept that adoption is not weird or embarrassing and it is okay to talk about, love and think about birth parents whether they know and remember them or not. Birth parents are an important part of who our adopted children are and this book has been valuable to us for starting that dialogue with our child."
5,A great book for fostering love for the birthmother,"This charming adoption book shows us loving and caring adoptive parents who know how to handle the difficult moment Cecilia first hears about her adoption and says ""I want you and Mommy to be my ONLY mommy and daddy!"" We had the same experience with our daughter whom we adopted at four days of age. She didn't want to hear about another mommy and throughout the years wished we had not brought up the subject. The author is sensitive about having a teacher understand Cecilia's questions about her birthmother and assure Cecilia that her birthmother loved her. This is a good book for adoptive parents whose children need to be reassured of their permanent place in the adoptive family and who should be encouraged to love their absent birthparents.Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"
3,md,"I am currently in the process of adopting two four year olds and thought the book would be helpful. Although it may be helpful to older children, I found it a bit depressing. I would worry after reading it my younger children they would start having some of the thoughts or symptoms described in the book just from hearing them."
2,Too strong for young children,"This book I felt was too strong for a younger child. The emotions of how the child felt when she knew she wasn't ""wanted"" and how she rebelled. Yes it may be true that adoptive children will do such things, but if the child is not doing so and then reads this and does it what does that tell you. The end mellows out when everyone is happy and the child shows happiness w/the special party for adoption day signing. In my personal opinion, this is not a book I would promote."
3,inevitable questions,"It is my understanding many adopted kids have the same feelings and thoughts as discussed in this book. It makes it not weird to talk about. I gave it 3 stars because I would say it is not a young childrens book, more like mid to upper elementary."
3,"Fair, but not as good as other purchases","I ordered a book which came to me in the ""used"" condition it was claimed to be in, however, it was MORE used than I would have expected for book I paid $30.00 for used."
3,Hand-held Massager,"Holding the unit with two hands provides a nice massage. However, when I hold it with one hand and hang it over my shoulder to do my back, it jumps around and doesn't deliver a very comforting experience. Could this be because I am small (5 ft) and not strong enough to put any pressure on the unit while it is hanging down my back?? Anyway, a little disappointing :-("
1,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of Cafe Del Mar, but this CD was highly disappointing. The music did not evolve, let me say, there wasn't even a track that got me interested. I hope the producers don't continue down this road."
3,pretty much the ordinary rapcore stuff,"well, this album isn't bad. but it also isn't good. just pretty mediocre and forgetable. i heard it twice and there wasn't one song that really attracted my attention in beeing very good or very bad. the vocals are the normal rap, the guitar riffs are, well, pretty much the same you hear on every rock/metal record. i gave it 3 stars just because the cd is not bad, and in it's release year 1995 there wasn't as much rap-core...as today. i prefer downset or (hed)p.e."
4,diamond in the rough,"if only to hear buena vista alone, it is worth it to pick this album up. i would give it 5 stars, but i need to be realistic in that, sure, this album is meant for the fans in particular. the other reviewers who say they are ""the hugest"" fans and loved the first two albums but can't get a feel for this one... well, they really aren't such fans as they say, and that's all.so obviously you need more reasons than just buena vista to buy this, cuz you're skeptical enough to be reading this. ok, then listen for waster, flavors, getting better, bring your lovin back here, touchin' up, and machismo.and rosemary. simply amazing. the atmosphere that this song creates is simply astounding. each note sinks deep into your veins, and penetrates your senses.so buy it."
2,Abandoned B sides,"What happened? Where's ""Pick up the Pieces"", ""The Best In The Town"",and the turbo version of ""Whippin' Piccadilly"", these are the real B-sides that Gomez fans need to hear (not two pointless versions of ""Sh--bag""). Although, this disc isn't completely lost, ""Buena Vista"" and ""Bring your Lovin' Back Here"" are excellent tracks that truly exhibit SOME of Gomez's hidden treasures, but certainly not all of it. Gomez could have had it's third straight classic, but I guess it wasn't meant to be."
3,"Scattered and rambling, but a must have for the Gomez fan","I'm not quite sure Gomez has established themselves long enough to have a sort-of ""lost songs"" type of disc,but they put one out to tie us over.Collections tend to be jagged and not very smooth, and this is no exception. There are a good number of hits, but a few misses as well. If you're not familiar with Gomez, get their first two discs. It'll give you a better understanding of their style than this thrown together album."
2,hardcore fans only,Nice to see where some ideas for songs orginated from but not worth purchasing. I'm a huge Gomez fan but I'm not crazy about this. The Machismo album is pretty good (and better) for early stuff. Hopefully we'll have a new album soon.
3,"I love the band, but not this","There are a few jems here, but the rest is pure filler. There first two records, however, are some of the best stuff I have heard in years, especially their debut. I can't recommend either one strongly enough - and I mean it. Not this, though."
1,wrong prouduct,"I received a cable with a usb on one end and a smaller printer type usb on other end ,CABLES UNLIMITED ZIP-USB-C05 Zip-Linq USB-A to Mini USB 5 Pin Retractable CableI can't use this cable with my treo.Dnny Lyons"
2,A Gloomy Book that doesn't reveal anything we don't already Know,"Although I agree with Mr Carter's values, and believe he may be the best living president, I didn't like this book because it describes what is wrong with America, yet doesn't give any advice on how to correct it.What a depressing read. I believe Mr Carter could have written a better book if he would have added advice on what people that share his views could do to improve the situation. Am I to believe there is nothing that we can do? Is that why he has a look of dispair on the front cover?"
1,Wolf in Sheeps Clothing,"It is difficult to accept moralizing from a former president whose actions over the past 15 years have come just short of outright sedition. Carter's demeanor and style on the surface project a calm, considered, almost scholarly critique of U.S. policy. Once one considers the facts, however, it becomes clear that Carter is merely advancing a politically socialist and anti-American agenda."
1,Can't give negative star's,This from a man who is partially responsible for the mess we're in today. It's a self-rightous rant from an imbecile.
1,Values?,This book was a complete waste of money. I do not recmmedent it.Carter goes on and on ad nauseum with his attacks.His book and ideas will do more to hurt this country than help it.
4,Very enlightening,"If you like Jimmy Carter, you'll probably like the book. I've never been a huge Carter fan, but I actually liked the book. His explanations of the societal impacts of contemporary global issues, 911 etc. are very interesting. It's a great example of how liberalism can be intertwined with ethics and morality, i.e. liberal doesn't necessarily imply a compromise of morals. Not...considering that the majority of liberal people are secular progressives.It's strange how such a traditionalist can be a left winger. He's a great person and philanthropist and does a great job of explaining the humanistic virtues that permeate his views. A good read!! I'm not a religious person and, like others who reviewed this book, never felt like he was preaching. Much of what he says is based on family values and traditional americanism. Too bad he's not a Republican, he could probably do a great deal for conservative politics."
1,Not the book I order,"As you can see above, I order a signed leather copy of the book. I got a regular hardback, not leather, not signed."
5,Excellent Insight from Someone Who's Been There,"OUR ENDANGERED VALUES is an insightful, compelling look at the dangers of fundamentalism and how the current leaders of our wonderful nation have put our country in danger. The danger is when you do not live up to your own treaties and declarations, how can you expect other rouge nations to do the same.President Jimmy Carter comes from this at a unique perspective of having been there/done that type of thing. He has been in Mr. Bush's shoes and he has helped negotiate with the leaders who are currently going back on their word, because we have gone back on ours.Well worth the read."
5,Right On,"Mr. Carter comes to this book from his own perspective as a Christian, a military veteran and a business man and a man of character unlike the persons today who claim that title and are frauds.The Dixiecrat/Republicans will not like this book. The Religious right, i.e. Christians minus the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes and the parable of the rich man; those who think the only important book of the Bible is Revelations, will not like this book. Those who think it took courage to serve in the National Guard or get five deferrments during Vietnam will not like this book.But we sure need someone to tell it like it is and President Carter does that in this book."
1,Unless you need to start a fire...,If you were trapped in a cave and need some paper to start a fire then buy this book. More of the same... Save your money.
1,Heavy dose of religion and political bias.,"I like Jimmy and have been impressed with his involvement in domestic and international events. This is the first book of his I tried to read. Endangered Values isn't much of a book, 202 pages in 17 chapters of double-spaced large font with plenty of white space interspersed throughout. If you can get over the heavy dose of religion sprinkled throughout the book, and the shady partisan statistics and studies cited within, he addresses a wide variety of issues. Sort of like trying to solve all the puzzles of the world in 60 or so regular pages. The biggest turnoff for me was the religion. Maybe my own fault considering the title and what I should've expected."
5,"A wonderful, intelligent, sincere book","This is a must read for any citizen who senses something is terribly wrong with the values and family values agenda we are seeing in our public life.I became very aware through Pres. Carters use of facts that I need to pay attention to the values I hold, and not let my government misrepresent me, and my fellow citizens, to the world.I have in the last 4 years felt ashamed to be an American--this book gave me hope we can change our course and become truly ethical and moral people again--not phony bullies."
2,Endangered left-wing values,"President Carter begins his book with commendable and non-controversial values such as honesty, love of neighbor and belief in God. Thus, at first, the book appears to be a defense of older values against secular modernity.However, President Carter quickly shifts gears into a critique of political and religious conservatives. It becomes clear that the people attacking his values are today's political and religious conservatives. The villains are Republican Evangelicals, Catholics and Jews.It turns out that the values President Carter is defending are largely the values of the modern left-wing elites -- abortion rights, homosexual rights, environmental rights and international law. Thus, President Carter is not actually defending traditional values against modernity. Instead, he is defending modernity against traditional values."
4,Morality as a foundation,"President Carter writes that we as people need to be moral in all of our actions, even in politics. He understands, of course, that not everyone is that way and he describes why we need to come back to a starting point that is just and fair in the way we deal with eachother as human beings. We can be ruthless with eachother, and these words can have a sort of naivette about them, but then I have to remember that he was the President and to get that that position, one would have to be also adept at navigating thru the dark side of the political game as well."
2,A muddled message,"I'll admit I haven't yet finished this book. I find it rather diffiult work. Almost an act of faith in itself that by the end there will be revelation.I'm not a religious person. Although Jimmy doesn't constantly bring up religion on every page, it does feel as though he does. Hammering home Christianity, evangelism, fundamentalism and so on gets a little tiring for me. If America has a moral crisis, it's more likely to be caused by religion than solved by it. I don't need to believe in 'God' or 'our Saviour Jesus Christ' to have morals and morality. His heart is true but his message will probably only preach to the converted.On the book itself, it's poor value. Poorly made, thin, doubled spaced type and a reasonably large typeface. I wonder what the wordcount is?"
1,"Well, there he goes again...","Jimmy ""stagflation, malaise, Olympic boycott, Iran hostage crisis"" is at it again with his pious, higher-than-thou moral indignation. Carter has the rhetoric and demeanor of SNL's church lady as he scolds the present admistration and others for its alleged moral wrongs. Combined with his disgraceful politicizing of Coretta Scott King's funeral this book exemplifies his true malicious character. Not event the revisionist historians can rewrite one fact - Jimmy Carter was one of the worst President's ever whose name is synonomous with ""Loser""."
1,Jimmy Carter screws up ......again!,For years I have been hearing from my parents and others how Jimmy Carter screwed up during his devasting term (1 term thank God) as President of the USA. And I think that we never really recovered from Carter-nomics. Clintononomics sunk us even deeper. So Herbert Hoover can rest in his grave that at least two presidents did a worse job than him.Carter totally misses the point in this new book and real christians will not buy into the hype. Wasn't Jimmy Swaggert fron Georgia too?
5,A book all Americans should read,I have found this to be a most honest and direct evaluation of the current national situation. It is an easy book to read and demonstrates the unusual honesty of Jimmy Carter as a past president and current world humanitarian. His evaluation of the current administration's shortcomings and intrigue in its selling of the Iraq war to the American public and Congress is most interesting and enlightening. He substantiates his concern for the other detrimental actions of the present administartion throudh his own religeous beliefs and gives an explanation of his separation from the Southern Baptist Convention.
4,Impressive take on a subect that can be elaqueated,"As a moderate in this country, I have always felt uneasy with the current adminstration agenda. President Carter, who I feel is very genuine in this book, has detailed what is deeply wrong with the right wing of the Republican party. They have seemed to have ""highjacked"" patriotism to a level I have not seen in this country. The notion of ""Either you're with us or against us"" proves that fundamentalists have no direct business in government. The reason I gave the book 4 stars, is because Carter did not explain in great detail how we can peacefully combat the likes of the Dobsons, Robertsons, and the Farwells. Furthermore, this book was very uplifting, and once again proves to me that Christians are a group of people who help the poor, nonvoilent peace loving personas, something the Bush adminstration has forgotten."
5,Favorite...,"This is my favorite book written by a president (to be a book, not a compilation of their other writings/speeches). Stays modest, but not meek; Strong, but not sensationalist. This, even though Jimmy Carter is not my favorite president (though I have a soft spot, being from Georgia.)An excellent read with refreshing looks at political issues facing the country today."
1,Noise From the Liberal Peanut Gallery,"Carter was a politically-correct loser. No one wants to hear his religious moralizing, fundamentalist or no. We didn't want him then, we sure don't want him now. The best thing that happened to Jimmy Carter was Ronald Reagan. Carter needs to be quiet and go back to raising peanuts, a job he can handle."
3,A nieve view of our world colored by his religious views,I was very disapointed with this book. It is clear that Jimmy's actions and thoughts are ruled by his religious beliefs. He has a simplistic view of what is wrong with our government and the asault on democracy. I t is easy to see how his presidency was flawed. Al Gores book was more to the point on what is wrong and the real dangers facing the US and the world. His book is not a bunch of anicdotes and reflections it gives us facts and the benefit of expert testimony on the problems we should be talking about.Jimmy's book reminded me of the writing of the Dali Lama. He too is very nieve and has a simplistic view of the world through the eyes of religion or spiritual thought.
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"I had high hopes for this book but unfortunently it didn't live up to expectations.The first negative came in the forward when he mentioned that he was strong on defense when President. Having been in the Navy during that I time I can definently state that he wasn't strong on defense. As I read farther into the book while he gave lip service to the idea that both the liberals and conservatives had problems, in the end the book became a critique against the conservative veiwpoint.I was also disappointed that although he mentioned in many places what he believed, when he detailed his actions, I would wonder why he didn't take a stand.All in all this is Morals Lite."
2,Unimpressed,"Here is all you need to know about this book. Imagine an aging Old School Liberal Modernist Baptist former President thinking that the classy way to rip the sitting president is to shroud it in the garb of a concerned Sunday School Teacher who between Mondays and Saturdays criss-crosses the globe looking for people to help come to terms with a outdated understanding of human rights. Yeah, that's this book.I can't help but wonder, though, whatever happened to that unwritten policy that former presidents do not comment on or detract from the work and direction of the current president? Carter apparently thinks that doing so as a concerned Christian makes it okay. I think that just makes it even less classy.I do have to give Mr. Carter some credit, though. If his reporting of the current administrations actions and attitudes is at all accurate, the U.S. has a long uphill battle to gain any respect from most of the rest of the world."
1,Jimmy Carter's Liberal Agenda,"Another desperate attempt at taking shots at the current administration. His efforts in helping the needy are admirable, but he is so far removed from running a country. He can not truly grasp the challenges our leaders face in today's world full of terrorism and uncertainty."
1,Little Jimmy does it again,"Does anyone really care what this arrogant ex President has to say? I guess we do since he's still writing books. I read the book at my local Borders store. I wasn't about to pay the fifteen dollars to read what Preacher Jimmy has to say about America's foreign policy. Now that the Democrats have taken over Congress I'm sure we'll all have to get out the barf bags because we'll be seeing a lot of Jimmy. It's not enough that he whored for the Nobel prize for years, but his actions during the Reagan administration were dispicable at best and treasonous at worst."
3,A bit disappointing,"Even though I am biased towards Jimmy, I was a little disappointed by this book. While some sections are very succinct and Jimmy is clearly writing from the heart, for $15 one would expect a little more analysis and explanation of the major issues of the day."
5,Thoughts From A Man of Great Moral Character,"Jimmy Carter spells out our eroding American values in engaging in preemptive war, disrespect of the rights to personal life-style choices; challenges to women's rights; invasion of religious dogma in politics- attempts at eroding separation of church and state; defiling of our cherished beacon of liberty and justice standing around the world; go-it-alone mentality distorting foreign relations; corporate intrusion and influence in government affairs and the list goes agonizingly on. And all this from a devout Evangelical Christian. Carter is truly a man of great moral character and insight whose calls for moderation, equal justice for all, care for the downtrodden, etc. come across quite clear."
1,I should have KNOWN Better...,"Based on the Pub Weekly review, I thought I might enjoy the topic - I agree with that premise. This book was way too much about Carter's own religion and too little about the issues. (In mMy Opinion)"
4,Very good...and so nostalgic!,"People who grew up with these songs will find this CD incredibly nostalgic. Who can forget ""Sleepy Shores"" and its wonderful piano solo, or ""In the Limelight"", so uplifting. This is instrumental music from the 50's and 60's that was written for TV commercials and sitcoms. Once you listen to it, you become attached to it and you never want to let go. It is not for everyone, but if you want to remember and smile, buy this CD."
3,good album but song writings could of been beter,a lot of people give this one a high rating but I don't think it's one of their best albums. If you never heard Iced Earth before you would be beter off to get the dark saga or something wicked this way comes because I think they have beter song writings and a lot more heart not to mention Matt Barlow's vocals are beter on those albums.But if your looking for a heavy and aggresive album this one is for you.Also if your looking for some kick ass druming this album has it.The druming style is very similer to Metallica's master of puppets and in justice for all albums.
3,third release improves,"ahh yes, smack dab, a new singer, and ie's best yet..and best ever..singer matt barlow does a great job on this cd, and do all other members. imo, this cd isn't ie's best at all, and they had some work to do to improve their overal music, but not w/o writing songs like ""burnt offerings"" and ""dante's inferno""...definetely worth picking up"
3,Respectable Metal Band,"Iced Earth is a decent heavy metal band and I may very well buy some of their other stuff, but the people who gave this 5 stars must be smoking something funny!"
3,Not Bad,"Not a bad metal album and certainly 'old-school' in it's overall sound. Could have been the greatest metal album of the late eighties...except it was released in the mid nineties! Song style is a bit dated, but I still enjoy it."
1,dissapointment,there are two versions to this album and i ordered the version that was displayed and i was sent the wrong one!
1,&#65533;Iced Earth&#65533;? Ha!,"Forget this phoney ""metal"" band and listen to some Iron Maiden, young fools!"
5,UNBELIEVABLE,"this is a must have metal album. totally unique and awesome band, i just feel compelled to tell the world about these guys. matt barlowe has an awesome voice, and jon shaffer is an awesome musician. to describe their sound they sound like if iron maiden and old metallica joined forces. they are heavy and fast like metallica and melodic and epic like iron maiden. dante's inferno is the pinicle track on the album, an awesome 16 minute epic. I beseech each and every metal fan out there, if you have not heard this band before you need to start listening to them now. start out with this album, then go for night of the stormrider or dark saga."
3,Expected more...,"I love trance, know alot about Tiesto, but am a little disappointed with this CD.His mixing is fairly smooth; I didn't notice any bad beatmatching or screw-ups. It flows fine as well.I guess my only problem with this CD is the track selection. It doesn't really make me want to get up and dance. Also, I've heard his remix of Silence too many times.For people who are new to trance might enjoy this CD more than myself, but he uses a few tracks that have already been featured on other DJ mixes. The tracks that I didn't hear weren't outstanding either.It's not that this CD is bad, it's just that it's not great.I'll recommend Kimball Collins Generation Trance 2000. I've been pushing this CD ever since I got it last year. That is one great trance CD!"
4,Different but good,"I've ownd this cd since it was first released. It's different for a Tiesto mix cd. This is due to the fact that it was his first release on a North American label; hence it was geared to our market. This is probably the most ""unique"" Tiesto cd there is, and that can be good or bad. If you heard it without knowing who was mixing, you may not think it was Tiesto. That being said, it is overall a very good mix. In typical Tiesto fashion, he starts out slow, lets the music peak towards the end and ends on a high note with Sparkles. Probably not a ""must have"" except for fans and collectors, but a decent fun mix, though now a little dated."
3,summercheeze?,"I'm sure that diehard fans will disagree, but this disc falls far short of ""In Search of Sunrise 3."" None of the songs are terrible in themselves, however they all have a very commercial feel. My personal taste steers clear of most of this stuff, but I aknowledge that many do like this type of music. And for this type of listener the album is recommended. The songs have a techno feel (read: repetative and sounds like fingernails across a chalkboard) that drifts away from the trancier tunes that I prefer. However, this is merely an issue of personal preference: to each is own. Thus, the 3 star rating... :)"
4,our cosmic temple never closes its doors,"Tiesto's Summerbreeze is warm and refreshing. A captivating release, featuring some hot female vocals. They take the listener on an emotional rollercoaster through our galaxy. Sometimes a cosmic cathedral, sometimes the Blue river. Sometimes a computer factory, and finally the discotheque to the stars. Definitely one of Mr.Tiesto's greatest."
4,Trance with a little techno,"This is a cd which is hard to get in the Netherlands, but i was lucky and now he is very often in my cd-player. I`am a little bit sorry for the rest of the world because they don`t hear Tiesto a lot. He is probably the best producer in the world. He has mixed so many cd`s from Forbidden Paradise to his Magik Series, until now he has mixed 6 Magiks and his new cd: In Search of sunrise 2 is very good. But we have to return to Summerbreeze. The first number on the album is very nice, but while going on the cd becomes so good that my hand goes all the time to the repeat button. I don`t think Amazon will be happy about this bu if you want more info about tiesto you have to go www.intrancewetrust.com . Also pay a visit to www.bol.com for more info. But everybody keep up the trance and in trance we trust. See ya on the next review"
2,I'm confused...,"After hearing Tiesto hailed as ""one of the best trance djs out there"" by several different people, reading the rave reviews here on Amazon, and looking at the sticker on the album that compares him to Paul Oakenfold, I was convinced: this album would be amazing. But as soon as I popped into my cd player, I was in for a big disappointment. All the tracks leading up to the best track are completely unmemerable. (That would be track 10, the Delerium ""In Search of Sunrise"" remix, which is why I gave this album 2 stars). I am a huge electronica fan, and so is my brother, who also heard this record playing and remarked how completely bland it is. Not bad, but bland. I would definitely say dwnld a few of these tracks before you waste your money. The electronica genre is filled with potholes like these, save your money for something original and different. ... ...I am at a complete loss as to how some people can find this worthy of 5 stars..."
4,Tiesto is a Trance god.,"I had heard of Tiesto until this past August when I got to see him play live in Amsterdam at the quarterly Wildlife party at Melk Weg ( Milky Way ) I had bought his Magik : Live in Amsterdam only a couple of days before that and found out it was recorded at the same club at the last Wildlife party. The cd was incredible but not as awe inspiring as watching him take a capacity crown and lead them through a journey into trance. The entire place moved and I'm not talking about just the dancefloor, he is a great technical dj and has mastered the art of the buildup better than anyone I have seen. If you like good Trance then you can't go wrong with DJ Tiesto, I recomend trying to find the Magik series if you can. I only saw it in Amsterdam."
3,Not Tiesto's best work,"I'm a huge fan of Tiesto. He's a brilliant remixer and producer, but this CD isn't really representative of his best work. Its fairly generic (and someowhat old) euro-trance, and pretty bland. Unless you need to have a copy of some of these songs, I'd suggest passing on this one and getting his much, much better Revolution 2-CD set instead, which is 2 hours of cutting edge trance and progressive house."
4,Revisionist history at it's best!!,"This is one of the most amusing books I have read about fallen European dynasties. Extremely biased, but makes up for inacurracy with humor to spare. Not for serious academic research, but very entertaining. I highly recomend it for anyone who knows their history, and is looking for a few good laughs!"
1,Biased History,"This book is badly flawed because of the author's rabid Germanophobia,which practically drips off of neary every page.Stay away from this one."
4,Best of Legends of Metal Volumes 1 and 2,"If I remember right, this is actually the first one I bought of the series of four. I found out later that this one actually came out a year after Legends of Metal Volumes 1 and 2. It's actually more or less a ""Best Of"" CD which takes some songs from both. The only song that is not on either of the first two volumes is Strapping Young Lad's cover of Exciter. I like this version because they crank up the intensity and speed. It also has a funny bit at the end of that track. No matter how old I get I never seem to get tired of juvenile humor. If I had bought this series of cds in chronological order I still would have bought this one just for that song alone. Even though the songs are repeats of ones I already had from volumes 1 and 2, it was still worth it."
2,The date the millennium ends is not one of opinion.,"It might be interesting to read, if the author weren't so arrogant and self-centred... and if, as a scientist should, he knew a bit more about mathematics. The question of when the millennium ends is not one of opinion, it is what it is. There is no year zero. Zero is an instant, namely the origin of the time axis. Let's graduate this axis in years. The interval between zero and 1, is called year 1. The interval between zero and -1, is called year -1. I repeat: there is no year zero. If the instant zero is the birth of Christ, year 1 is year 1 AD, year-1 is year 1 BC. And, of course, the second millennium after Christ ends on December 31, 2000. That's all there is to it."
4,The Millennnium: Just a Thousand Years,"As the year 2000 approached us, millennial worries proved quite the cash crop for pop culture. Although Gould goes into a lot of detail, providing more than most of us ever cared to know about the millennium, his book is a valuable and very necessary addition to an aspect of our culture that generally seems to promote fear in its beholders. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Gould encourages us to plunge onward, forward into the twenty-first century, eyes wide open."
5,"History, controversy, and more!","I learned quite a lot from this book. History of calendrics, controversy over when a new milennium 'starts', and the arbitrary way we track time. (Did I mention the fabulous illustrations?)I never knew George Washington (for example) had two birthdays, depending on which western calendar you use.The last section ""Why?"" is just beautiful."
3,Readable but Not As Good As It Could Have Been,"I like Gould's writing and his thinking, on the occasions he thinks. But he, like too many science essayists, gives into an urge to emote and to put aside that vaunted rationalism. Instead, he irrationally sides with popular opinion on when the new millennium began and then tells a somewhat moving but totally irrelevant story about a mentally handicapped young man who can calculate what day of the week a day came out. He also indulges, less than usual, in his dislike of religion.As a stylist, Gould is among the best in the world of science. As a thinker, he's someone to reckon with. But as a total writer, he needs a bit of help. Still, this is a good history lesson."
4,"Thank you, Mr. Gould!","Gould does an excellent job of showing how silly and arbritrary it is to attach importance to the year 2000 (2001?). Night will fall and day will break the same as always on the last night and first day of whichever of those years you've chosen to celebrate. (Of course, many computer systems will never be the same again!) Gould supplies many interesting facts and tidbits along the way. Although he gets a bit windy at times, I think everyone should read this short book."
3,Ok product,Cannot fire you weapon via C or Z button on the Nunchuk.Mapping Wiimote and Nunchuk anyone?
3,"A good case, with one exception","This case is a convenient size, well made, and easily holds insulin and supplies for several days (although the tiny cold pack in it will only last a few hours, so you need to take that into account). It includes a rectangular sharps-disposal box that's pretty much useless. You can only dispose of one used syringe in it, and then you have the problem of disposing of the box. The space taken up by that box could be put to far better use for other things."
3,A magical physics tour,"A weird one from Rucker, but then, that's kind of a redundancy; everything from the mind of Rucker has a weird stance. This one posits the idea that space/time is a continuum, and circular in nature. That is, if one was to increasingly make oneself smaller and smaller, after passing through the various levels (atomic, subatomic, etc.) one would then start progressing through space (universe, galaxy, solar system, etc.). Like Robert Anton Wilson's ""Schrodinger's Cat"" trilogy, Spacetime Donuts posits the theory, then fits a story around what it might be like if that theory were true. Rucker's writing style, at least in this early novel, is most similar to the early novels of Philip K. Dick, but whereas Dick was focused on the nature of reality from a psychological and philosophical viewpoint, Rucker comes at it from a mathematical and physical view."
1,The Blue Note,"Put this book aside after reading about half of it. Characters had no depth, actions had no explanations, dialogue was silly and incomplete. I can't believe the same author also wrote ""Under the Chestnut Tree"" which I really enjoyed."
2,misleading,"I really like the fabric and would have loved to item, however, when calling it a comforter cover you sometimes miss the word cover. Really it should be called a duvet. I thought i was ordering one thing and received another. I did very much like the duvet though..."
2,Pikachu,This toy is cute - my son likes Pokemon but the tail falls out all of the time so he doesn't play with it. IT was a waste.
3,Not bad,"Worked great untill bolt broke holding the head after pressing only 8 rows of deck boards. Replaced the bolt with a stronger grade 5 bolt, and no problems since"
3,"Sensitive for a man Just right for a woman... err, maybe...","If you collect Yoko Kanno music then you might buy this one. From its infancy, the tracks meld from loneliness to chaos to conflict to loneliness. The vocals save this work from the ashcan though. How's that deodorant commercial go? But I bought it just 'cause."
3,daughter loves this!,"I bought this for my daughter on the recommendation of my son. She plays it all the time, and really enjoys it - Thanks!"
4,Light 10 Minute Studies,"This book is good for the busy woman. I can usually do one lesson every morning as it only takes about 10 minutes. Also, it gives suggestions for ideas for deeper study if you want as well."
5,Nice watch and got lucky when i was buying it....,I got it for 35$(on sale) and a few days later it was back to some 85$....its a nice and a pretty watch to add to ur collection...
2,Should have done more shopping,This is the first time I have been disappointed in an on line purchase. The watch will do but the on line photos did it more justice than it deserved.
4,"Wanta a red, red watch?","I collect watches and this one is a welcomed additon. It is a little small, but definately worth the money."
4,Double bass staple,"Through years of teaching drumset, I still find this to be the most useful of all Double bass drum books, despite its age, due to the extent of the variety of exercises it exhibits. Not to be overlooked"
1,disappointing,"Would be great to get a true appreciation of High Magick and Crowley either through audio or visual, but I'm afraid this is not it! Another ""spooky"" experimental CD which is more likely to put people off, than attract them to Thelema."
2,somewhat misleading...,"not too sure what exactly i got w/ this 6 cd set. lots of ""experimental"", er ""ambient"" (?) ""music"" to be found. allegedly there are actual fragments of his voice, incantations. i don't know. would appreciate subsequent reviewers filling me in, as the box and booklet provide no information as to what is on the cds (plenty about the great beast, tho, thanks). weird."
2,Totally Misleading,"Out of all six discs in this set there is only one disc that actually has Crowley speaking. The other five discs are ambient music by Steve Pittis, Jim Jones, Barn Jehovi and Band of Pain. Some of these have highly distorted samples of Crowley but for the most part I wonder why the hell they're in this set. To me this compilation seems like somebody just slapped Aleister Crowley's name on it in order to make some money. If you're looking for a CD that is just Crowley try and get a copy of the 666 import. It's the same as the first two discs of this compilation but definitely cheaper and more to the point."
3,"Works, but not as easily as claimed.","I gave this product three stars, because it does work, but the video showing how easy they are to put on is a fantasy. Unless you have a very mellow cat, you will need to sedate it to apply these nail covers. Once you put the glue in, you need to get the nail cover on right away because otherwise the glue will dry. Also, the colors are pretty, but unless you get the clear, you can't tell how much glue is actually in the nail cover. Not enough, it won't stick. Too much, it overflows onto their toes (and your fingers). BUT.. if you do get your cat to hold still, and you do get the proper amount of glue, they do work and they do last as long as they claim to."
2,Click-Click-Click,"These claw caps were good for like 2 weeks, until her claws grew out again. I was hoping that the caps would last for 3 weeks and then they would fall off and i could replace them... No. You gets your moneys worth, thats for sure. These things stay on and are not budging. I think they have been on my cat for a good 6 weeks now. At least. She still scratches at my rugs, and she has ruined the corners of them, regardless of the caps. Which really makes me mad. I basically wasted my money. I wanted an alternative to declawing, this is not it.I still can't get the damn things off, so I am just clipping her nails through the caps, until the caps finally grow off. I was just going to wait until they fell off naturally, but they would make a clicking sound on my wood floors when she walked around early in the morning and it was extremely irritating."
5,Awesome product,"Perrrfect (had to do it) solution for kitty nails. No more scratched up kids or couches. Have used on 2 differant cats and worked to my (high) expectations on both. Comes w/good amount of product. Typical fake nail glue. Neither cat loved the process of putting them on, but tolerated it. Both tried to pull them off, w/little to no avail. Dind't seem to hurt or hinder them in anyway, EXCEPT 2nd cat would get them stuck on the blinds ""string"" (my only con, worry). Eventually a cover or two would fall (probably get pulled) off, & i just glued another back on. After reading how inhumane it was to have cat nails permantely removed (declawed) and picturing how i would feel if i had my knuckle cut off, i just had to try these. So glad they worked so well, am a lifelong customer. Will buy more in other colors (hubby wasn't thrilled about purple on 2 male cats)..."
3,Mixed Feelings,"These nail caps were really easy to apply and they look really good on my cat. However, when the cat's nails start to grow out, it causes the cap to get caught in carpet, blankets, etc, which tends to create snags and is painful for the cat because they try to jerk their paw away. Maybe they could help this issue by creating a cap with a thinner edge for a smoother transition between nail and cap. I find it easier to just keep my cat's nails trimmed with clippers."
1,Don't stay on longer than an hour before they fall off the cats claws.,"They stayed on for about an hour, a couple stayed on for maybe 6 hours, before I had to pick them up from random places all over the house. Waste of money, might as well cover leather furniture or declaw cat."
1,"very poor, an amateur production","There was no aerobics here. Just film of girls riding a bike, lifting some weights, on a ski machine, with music dubbed over. This was a free-style skin flick. Not like the Ron Harris stuff."
1,Does not rate any stars,"Don't know where to start, its so bad. Lighting was bad, picture quality was none. No direction, it seemed like the girls did not know what to do, the camera man did not know what to shot. Seem like the film should have gone at the end of number two, and left there. Best thing I can say, DON'T waste your time or money."
3,interesting,"but they were no close-ups, when bench pressing or other times. the shower scene was good.. good range of breast size..4 white women with a-c cups and 1 black woman with d's or dd's.. she like to shake them while riding the exercise bike.. better if it was on dvd and not vhs.. but was cheap..."
3,heavy stuff,"this effort lacks the intense energy of Khronos and genesis but holds its own nonetheless. This album broods and is more restrained than the bands latest work. This album makes a nice warmdown from the energy of genesis. The vocals growl out and you can sense the intensity simmering below the surface but it never really comes thru. Thus, triarchy leaves you waiting for a climax of sorts, some form of release that never really happens. still, a worthy addition to ones rotting christ collection."
4,love of cats,my love of cats is why I ordered these but i had to pay as much shipping as the decals cost.
2,Run Away! Run Away!,"This book is basically unreadable. Impenetrable metaphysical terminology is used in dense, convoluted sentences to convey abstruse theories of meaning (at least I think that's what it is) in such a way as to be completely and utterly opaque. Half the time I didn't know what the guy was talking about, and I have a degree in this stuff and belong to Mensa. If you're interested in Turner, you'd do better to look elsewhere.Some good reproductions though, and if you're just interested in the pictures, the price is right. Hence the two stars; the text would be zero, since it's useless."
1,"Annoying, just like Michael said","This film was very annoying. The premise was in good faith, but the fade outs, light flashes, and the overall can't get a good look at the creature just didn't make it for me. The creature made me think it might be a ripoff of The Ring and The Grudge movies."
5,Suprisingly Entertaining,Predictable at times but a great movie to watch with friends and have a laugh.
1,TERRA BULL,"WARRIORS OF TERRA is pretty terrible. Filmed in a lot of darkness with jerky camera work and annoying fadeouts, the movie tries hard for suspense but ultimately fails miserably. An ecoterrorist group breaks into a facility to release test animals; they are aided by the security guard who is dating the big shot's daughter. They find no animals but when their computer geek opens all the doors, they release a secret genetic experiment---a girl who injects her victims with a poisonous toxin that liquefies their innards and is contagious as well. Seems like the father of the heroine has been trying to cure this girl for ten years---we never know what he's curing her of or who she is. Needless to say, the girl gets out and eats up most of the cast. Edward Furlong, whose career has pretty much gone down hill since his TERMINATOR days is the security guard and he is as bad as the rest of the unknowns cast. Another nail in the coffin of horror movies."
3,Thinking is a useful art,"and commenting on a reviewer who reviewed prior to street date makes a lot of assumptions - such as the person is not a reviewer outside of Amazon, the reviewer has not been to any place where the DVD might have been shown and knows no person who might have sent him/shown him the DVD, the reviewer never saw the film itself (which legitimizes certain potential complaints re the DVD - same basic cinematography, light level, most of film all the same) - that should be considered.Just as one example, recently I noticed a person on another site I visit often commenting on details of the Nailin' Paylin DVD over a week before release. I asked how he knew - turned out he has friends in the business and was sent a copy a couple of weeks before it came out/street dated."
4,nelsondave@attbi.com,The Civil War Journal is a very informative and entertaining look at the Civil War with original pictures and personal narratives ala Ken Burns. Civil War Journal draws on more sources though and delves deeper into specific areas where Ken Burns didn't have the time. The use of interviews with historians and authors lets the experts relate some human interest to the history.Danny Glover is a good choice as the host. he presents well and The History Channel throws in some reenacting to bring a little color to the program. I would like to see The History Channel release the rest of the series on DVD.
4,Civil War Journal,"Not the best attempt at examining the men at the helm during the Civil War - but certainly not the worst.Robert E. Lee gets fair treatment. He was a man of sound character and ethical principles. He had a strong belief in God's guiding providence.William T. Sherman, for the most part was treated objectively and fairly. Sherman was no where the 'devil' that those in the South made him out to be. It was his conviction that the only way to end the War was to make every one feel it's terrible consequences. To that end he waged 'Total War' in the south. He was right.All in all this is a good production. I have recommended it and loaned my copy to several friends. If nothing else -it provides material for discussion and debate."
1,Inaccurate Trash,This documentary has less research then a freshman term paper. In the very first few minutes of very first episode the narrator states a well debunked myth regarding Lincoln being the source of Pickett's West Point appointment. NOT TRUE! He was only a state legislator and did not have that power. Rather then bother with the details I will leave the reader to do the basic research that this team did not bother with.
5,Fantasy blends with elements of history,"In the past the counts of Germany have allied with different forces, but as nazism envelopes Germany, the family legend about supernatural powers draws one Rudolf Hess, Hitler's oldest friends, to a battle which will change his life. In Michael Moorcock's Dreamthief's Daughter fantasy blends with elements of history to make for a changing, unusual setting."
3,Easy read,"It's a super-simple read-- not too exciting, and sometimes the concepts are so simple that it was almost frustrating. It was the textbook for a college psych class... probably would have been appropriate for a more introductory level, high school class. I sold it immediately after the class was over..."
5,This CD will move you; it's a tapestry of liquid emotion,"This CD is for anyone who has lost a love, lost hope or experienced sadness in their lives. Each song is a mix of gloom with a hopeful and silver lining. Anneke's voice will bring you out of your dismal world and into a river of emotion. The music is excellent and sets the perfect mood. I would say that this is one of my all-time favorite albums."
5,GREAT as all albums from the Dutch band!!!,"Excellent album. Emotional, melodic, heavy. Buy it and buy Nighttime birds and How to measure a planet. Sometimes you have to listen coouple times but it grows on you a lot. I can't really say if any 90s band comes close to these guys."
5,I LOVE YOU ANNEKE,"Mandylion is a great record, it's a balance between harmony and melody, anneke's voice is wonderful and the rest of the band really know what they are doing, so,listening this record i feel in trance which bring you to different landscapes, from jesus era to the deepest place inside human being.And i could tell that the gathering is and intelillent band."
4,This is it,"This is their best album, forget the new one and get this. They were heavy on this album, yet the singing was still passionate and powerful. Highly reccommended."
2,Not worth your time.,"As an avid fan of all genres of music, I can honestly say that this album is not worth the plastic it comes in. It is an extremely cheesy style of metal, that I only gave a second star to because of the quality vocals. Nearly all of the songs are written in the same key, and all use the same chords. There is no variation in speed whatsoever. Every song sounds the same. When I first listened to the album, I didn't even realize that the first song was over, and it turns out that I had already listened to the first 4 tracks. The only positives are that the lead singer is very good, and that the lyrics are tolerable. Don't waste your time though."
3,sounds like just another lacuna coil,"if you like lacuna coil you should like this cd...but over all this cd sounds the same all the time and i think its boring, but thats just me"
2,Sorry I just don't see it.,"The clamor for this band is unrealistic. I am a fan of goth/rock/prog music, and I don't understand the appreciation for this album. Every band in or affecting the goth scene cannot be compared to this. Lacuna Coil...heads above the Gathering, sonically and lyrically. Evanescence..there is no comparison to this piece of badly-mixed offal. This CD disappointed me in so many respects that I almost tossed it after one listen. There are so many things wrong with this album that it is actually hard to describe without charts..and that is no exaggeration.The only saving grace on the entire CD is the resonating Anneke van Giersbergen. Sadly, her bandmates play so poorly that it drowns any wonder you might feel at her lilting, haunting voice. Is she as good as Amy Lee? Absolutely not. But when compared to the other members of her band, she stands alone on a stage of pretentious songwriting, poorly mixed music, and coma-inducing arrangements."
1,Laughable,"Colin Wilson is the ultimate credulist--his writings on alleged paranormal events are poorly researched, skewed, cherry-picked, and without any foundation of fact. If you have a pseudoscientific theory without any scientific evidence to back it up, Wilson embraces it without hesitation.There is no life after death. There is zero scientific proof that human beings sutrvive death and mountains of evidence to prove that they don't.This book is laughable."
3,Remastered gone wrong!,Got bad a$$ songs in this album but it dont sounds like it's remastered.I always play my albums in the PlayStation 3 with suround sounds pluged in it and every thing sounds pefect with it on... but for some odd reason it's hard to hear the vocals because the bass is too loud. The 4 bonus tracks are awsome! i would rate this album a 5 out of 5 but the auido is not good.
2,hmm... I don't know...,"Much as I've tried to like him, I don't ""get"" devin townsend - I don't understand why he's so popular. I suspect it's just because he deviates slightly from the norm in extreme metal, a genre in which any departure from the rigid formulas laid down decades ago is normally attacked viciously, but he has the ego, personality and will to back his ideosyncracy up, so instead of being labeled a ""sell out"", ""not true to the scene"" or whatever, he's hailed as a prophet. Not to say this guy doesn't mean business: he is, after all, a genuine manic depressive, one of that rare breed of musicians like Ian Curtis or Kurt Cobain who are genuinely not right in the head, and thereby make music, and the world, a lot more interesting. I have to say I really like Happy Camper, on account of it sounding really really sincerely cheesed off, and Skin Me awakens some kind of primal headbanging instinct, but otherwise it just sounds badly written and over produced to me. Sorry."
2,"Be careful...be very, very careful","A little bit of Les B. goes a long way. His bongo stuff(second half of the ""Tamboo/Skins"" release) could strangle a beatnik. However, the late 60s-70s muzak sound of ""Que Mango!"" is not classic Baxter, either. Skip this junk-and don't trust the one guy who, shockingly, quotes this as Baxter's best(???) I don't care who you are, get the album titled just that-""Baxter's Best""-and be done with it. It's quite high if found online, it seems, but I found one in a used jazz CD store in the Oak Park area of Chicago. A good name for this one is more space age lounge. The exotica stuff(as first half of ""Tamboo/Skins"" and his African releases)even gets a little old after a couple pieces-and ""...Best"" is the closest to lounge the guy gets."
1,TACKY TACKY TACKY,"You couldn't pay me enough money to listen to this garbage, cheese at it's very worst. Les Baxter going to new lows. Tacky disco 70's sounding latin tinged trash. Yuck..."
1,BEWARE -- Abriged Version! 1/2 the Cases are Missing!,"Hey, beware if you buy this that you will spend countless hours in the library copying all the missing cases! The seller says its obvious that they are selling the abridged version but its not---and they will not issue a refund!"
1,Abridged vs Standard,"I am very close to selecting this text for a seven unit course. The abridged version is not the one I need. It is extremely difficult to tell that the book being offered here is not the standard 1300+ page edition, and worse, the price seems to be for the more comprehensive version. I need to make sure that my students do not bring the abridged version to class. Further, the current edition is the Second Edition, and things have changed."
3,Not as good as my old one,"This is not a bad ricer but the fact that it comes with 2 different bottome plates is a nuisance. The plates can flip up while you are ricing and larger chunks slip though. My old ricer, some 40 years old, is so much better as the ricer bucket is in one pice -- unless you really need two different size holes in the bottom of the bucket, DON't BUY THIS RICER. Find one which is all in one piece."
4,Excellent value,"I like that this potato ricer has interchangeable discs with different sized holes. It seems reasonably well made, but is a little hard on the hands. One of my favorite uses for it is in making banana bread. I don't like chunks of banana, so this really helped smooth out the texture. Not only would I buy this again, but have already done so, once for my mom and once because I misplaced the discs."
1,Broke after 2 uses,"The ricer bent under light pressure and had to throw it away. I am not a large, strong person either and I cooked the potatoes till they were soft. This product was a piece of junk. Spend extra money on something more sturdy."
2,Edited to remove stars,"I didn't buy this to rice potatoes, in fact I don't even eat potatoes, but I love making ""potato"" pancakes using shredded zucchini instead of potatoes. I read somewhere you can use a potato ricer to squeeze the liquid out. I bought this for that purpose. When I first got it, it worked great and I gave it 5 stars. But after a couple months, I have discovered that buying it was a waste. The handle is weak and bends after a short time and then you can't use it anymore. I have used this thing less than 10 times and it is already bent beyond usability. Now I need to find a better heavy duty one. Spend more and get a better quality item."
4,outstanding value for the price,"You can spend $40, $50, or more on a good ricer... if you're an idiot that is. For less than $10, this one is going to do everything you need it to do. More expensive models will tout their ""super duper durable construction"" and other nonsense - but let's face it, you're going to be squishing cooked potatoes, ripe bananas or other items of similar consistency through this - not using it to crush gravel. This ricer is great for those purposes. Running potatoes through a ricer will make your mashed potatoes more velvety smooth, and riced potatoes are much easier to incorporate into dough for gnocchi than ones run through a food mill or mashed with an old school masher. At this price, buy two... not because it will wear out, but because someone in your family will want one too."
4,Works Great,"GREAT! Just what I was looking for, Thank you. Would recomend to all who are in need of this item."
1,Bent under pressure,I'm going to have to throw this away and get a new one because this one bent under pressure while putting soft potatoes through it. Terrible quality and product.
1,Not a well made product,rusts immediately! I would recommend you wash and dry it right away or you will be sorry! Very weak construction as well.
4,Repeat of original Charleston Receips,This is a much updated version of the original which my wife and I purchased when we lived there 40 years ago. It contains the wonderful low country recipes which should not be forgotten but adds more to our current way of an easier cooking without sacrificing what Charleston is all about.
5,Excellent starter cookbook,"Receipes are easy to follow - and each is rated according to it's difficulty, how well it will ""keep"", and whether or not it must be prepared well in advance.....Some especially good salads, soups and appetizers. As I said, it's a great starter book, but pros will love it too - it really belongs in every kitchen."
5,THIS VIDEO WILL IMPRESS THE BIGGEST ELVIS FANS,"This video takes you from the very beginning of young Elvis's career all the way to the sad end. Glorious footage of his performances, in all of them he is giving his all and it makes you truly appreciate him for the artist he was, a pioneer really before his time and his never giving up even in the end of his too short life and career. You will smile, laugh, shed tears and after your done watching you will find that you love Elvis even more."
5,If Only He Had Lived,"Dr. King proves in this book his steadfast bravery and determination. He fought, not for his own glory, but that a whole race of people could be free. Some critics will argue that he did not free the whole South, but he gave other leaders the courage to follow in his footsteps. He was a well spoken man who was sure of himself and who had the ability to inspire people with his words.It is amazing that he felt the need to justfy something that we take for granted today. I fully believe that the gay rights movement needs a leader like this man, it takes a great person to inspire greatness in others. Dr. King saw evil in the world and he refused to stop until unjustice was abolished."
5,Love this book,"An inside view of what he saw, experienced, and felt. What a descriptive account!! Read it. It's very enlightening. Would recommend to all people regardless of age race or gender."
5,Importand Message -- Beautifully Written!,"Though I lived during these amazing, historical events, I had never read any of Dr. King's books (except for excerpts). It was informative and moving to 'hear' Dr. King discussing what happened from his insider's perspective. Such an intelligent and thoughtful man, it was like being transported back in time.While I had expected the intellectual aspect of the book, I was delightfully surprised by the beauty of the actual writing! The entire book had a feeling of prose to me. For those who don't generally enjoy non-fiction, this book is a really pleasant read, which might seem akin to a historical novel.The events came alive and I remembered how amazing those times were. I read this for MLK Day 2013, and it was a perfect way to commemorate the occasion!(This really should be required reading in school...)"
2,It's required reading!!,"If this were a purchase made for leisure reading, not to say I wouldn't have done that, I may have enjoyed the onset to reading it but it's for a course so I suppose this is a very biased rating."
2,Not much more than a glorified history lesson.,"Although this book gives a good look into what went on during the beginning of this struggle for freedom, there is too much generalizing, simple retelling of facts, and logical conclusions for my taste. Come on man, where's the feeling?"
5,Excellent disc,"Just pick it up at this amount how can you afford to loose .You don't ya win out .This disc has excellent bands on it.Nevermore song garden of grey.As a result to me buying this disc I have purchased some the full lengths by these great bands.If you really want to get into deep rooted emotions then check out Nevermore's self title after you get this .Cause they are just an all out excellent metal band.Also check out emperor, and the others.I can't help but think everytime I hear the toxic remains song on here I am listening to maiden they sound so much like them. Well just pick this thing up .Take a metalhead's word for it century media's band rule."
1,Poor,"I ordered Season 1,2,3,4 of Cheers. I received ONLY Season 4.I informed them of this mistake, sent me postage paid label to return it.12/19/08 I returned Season 4.12/22/08 Received Season 4, AGAIN.As of today, I still have not heard from them as to how to correct this."
2,g force pens,the pens failed on me after only a few days it was as if they were real old or something. the in broke up and would not go to the tip.
2,"Received 9 in a box of ""12""","I give this product 2 stars, only because I like the pen very much. Like the title states, I ordered 2 boxes of 12. One box contained 12, the other 9. I will not order from this seller again. Amazon's customer service did issue me a partial refund, though."
3,most of it is long lasting.,"The first time I bought this pen was 5 years ago. It was a good sturdy pen and I was able to keep track of it and not lose it, for the most part... The clip kept falling off. If you push it forward it just goes ahead and slides right off. The second time I bought a set of these pens was when I joined the army and was in training. We had to take a lot of notes and I wanted a good set of pens that could easily slide into the pen pockets on the sleeve of my uniform. The grip made it difficult to put in and take out of my pocket and was quickly worn out. At least that time I had learned and super glued the clips in place. I still have that second set that I bought and that was 3 years ago. They are great pens but I'm switching to the Papermate DESIGN series. They are much better quality. no complaints yet."
4,Great Pens,"Love these pens. Sturdy, have a good weight + balance, write smoothly.One issue that happens is the rubber grip will wear out fairly quickly."
5,Best pen,After running out I couldn't find these pens locally so I had to order. Great feel and write well.
5,a fun read,55 chapters and a smile at the end of each one. very enjoyable. it would make a great movie!
5,Mind Altering Music,"It is amazing how this record changes depending on my mood. Sometimes it's sad, sometimes joyful, some times exciting. It is the soundtrack to life played very very slowly. One of my favorites."
3,"Overrated and overhyped, but some good songs","Spacemen 3 are one of the most overrated and overhyped bands of the 80s. Everyone seemed to want them to be the Second Coming of the Velvets, but they truly lacked the imagination, the melodic sense, and the sense of drama. That being said, this is probably their second best album, but only in the TAANG! edition. Its major flaws are that the songs are mostly all in the same key, and their drones are not really that interesting. Pluses: ""Walkin' with Jesus"" and ""Take Me To The Other Side."" But in all honesty, Spiritualized is a much, much better band. And the near total absence of any drums does not help at all here. Even the Velvets needed Moe Tucker slamming that bass drum to keep in line. Without any earthbound roots, too often the Spacemen dissolved into empty, purposeless blizzards of feedback. Overall the CD has a numbing effect. Listen to it once a month and you'll get something out of it; more often than that, and it'll seem dead boring."
4,A Perfect Introduction?,"Apart from the Revolution 12"" this was my real introduction to Spacemen 3. Some of my friends thought it/I was weird - but I didn't care. What a record. The cover of 'Transparent Radiation' must be one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded. 'Take me to the Other Side' is pure rock'n'roll energy and excitement. 'Ode to Street Hassle' (their tribute to Lou Reed) is appealing in its catchiness - but it is no pop tune.This is a heavily drug influenced record - ""In 1986, all I want to do is get stoned. All I want for you to do is get yourself a little higher."" What more needs to be said?Take this gem to the counter of your local record store and say its been prescribed to you - I guarantee you'll enjoy it."
3,as others mentioned...,it does need its own light sourcefor me using as a daily foot examination tool by the time I get the angle right to see my feet the rooms light source is almost always reflecting back at me.. I'll keep trying to work it though
3,Toad bad transfer,"terrible transfer from Amazon, the songs do not match the track numbers by a couple of seconds and the songs get cut before the next.....terrible !!"
3,Fair,"This is a fair product. As pen and watch cases go, it is inexpensive and it seems it. Not a luxury item really. It serves the purpose but clearly is less costly and well here a bit you get what you pay for. On the whole watch cases and pen cases are horribly overpriced."
1,Flooding piece of junk,"The thing starts when it feels like it, but usually floods by the third pull(yes, with the choke out),then takes an hour or more to clear. I don't have time for that-I'm a tree service, not a hobbyist. Instead of cutting with my 24"" Makita, I'm having to make do with my 15"" pro Husqvarna, which gets the job done eventually(hint hint). 2 shops say there's nothing mechanically wrong with that Makita, just floods. Well, that's a useless trait for a working situation."
5,4-5 stars,"I never give a 5 star review but this game is very close to a 5 star game. YOU WILL JUMP from this game (or maybe twitch). It has a religion based storyline that keeps you wondering what's going to happen next.You're given a choice in 2D or 3D controls. I recommend 3D controls but other people say that they like 2D. To each his own.I played it on the easy difficulty and easy puzzle setting and it was actually a little too easy. As you can see, this gives the game replay potential. Play on easy Difficulty but hard puzzles, or hard difficulty with easy puzzles.Now the tiny little bad side. The monsters are a little repetitious but once you clear a room it's cleared. no respawning of more monsters just cuz you returned. when you start a new chapter, it will introduce a new monster but you'll probably see more of them as the game goes on.Pick this up and enjoy it multiple times."
2,Yawn....,"I know this game is older than many (published 5 years ago), and I bought it cheap. I am glad I did. I admit reviewing a game that is this old may not be fair, but it should have a bit more staying power.In short, I found the third person camera annoying... The angles were distracting, and keyboard navigation was variable. How can you fight something when the camera view is from behind your head?? It is really incomprehensible who would have thought that anything but a quick switch to first person in a fight mode would be the only way to present these scenes. I am new to Silent Hill, but this one makes me not want to try any others. There are newer games than this--with better graphics and better implementation. If Silent Hill 4 comes around for PC, I would hope that it would be updated with first person perspectives."
5,Silent Hill 3,I had this game as a 5 disk set a long time ago but let someone borrow it and they lost it. Now I am wanting to play it again and can not find it anywhere in Michigan. Enter Amazon.com. The game is incredible and with the movie coming out it shows how things really went before the movie. I found it on Amazon.com for a great price and it shipped almost right away as 1 dvd. I now have it installed on my computer and play it all the time. I am so glad that Amazon is in business.
5,My Least Favorite SH,"warning, to play this you HAVE to play SH1, its kinda connectsHeather is a normal teenage girl, or at least that's what she believes, who lives with her dad, in a town not to far from Silent Hill. But one trip to the mall sends her world spiriling out of control, as a trip to the bathroom seems to rid the world of all human contacts, and replaces them with nightmarish creatures. Not only that but a strange man calling himself a detective is stalking her, as is an odd grey haird lady who speaks of ""God's coming"" and the transversion of this world.What could this all mean, how does heather fit into it? Maybe a trip to silent hill will clear things for her.....or kill her."
1,IF YOU HAVE A PENTIUM 7.000.000.000?!?!?!?!?,"OK, THIS GAME SUCKS SO MUCH THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND THE RIGHT WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW PISSED OFF I AM.EXPLAINING: EVERYTHING PEOPLE SAID HERE IS TRUE, MY COMPUTER SHOULD BE ABLE TO RUN THIS CRAP, BUT, GUESS WHAT???? IT CAN'T.YOU FROM KONAMI SHOULD PUT A LABLE IN THIS CRAP BOX SAYING:""...HEY, IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS, STOLE A COMPUTER FROM NASA...""YOU GUYS, STAY AWAY FROM THIS, DON'T BUY IT..."
5,I could hardly put it down.,"This is a fine, well -written account of the famous diary and the writing thereof, including information that I have never seen before. She describes exactly what Anne used for her diary (the famous red and white checked book did not begin to hold it all), and describes life in hiding as it must have been for all of the people in the Secret Annexe, not just Anne. The author speculates on Anne's writing and some of the choices she made--to have a romance with Peter, for instance. I recommend this highly to anyone who loves Anne Frank, but it is definitely for older young adults and adults as opposed to children."
2,Dont be fooled by the title !,"When i first got this book i was thinking "" yeah i got book for my book report and its not just any book its a book about Anne frank"" But once i started reading i noticed that this book hardly talks about anne frank instead it talks about everybody else in the attic and the helpers. So don't waste your time on this book if your looking for something about anne frank but if your looking for something about the whole family then this is your book."
3,3.5 stars,This album has some very heavy riffs and good melodies generally. It is their first album but i liked more much than the most known albums by them. I believe that nevermore and dreaming neon black are their best albums. Im not crazy to hear this stuff. Im between its ok and i liked them
5,Good headset for IP-phone purposes,"I am an international student in the US. I ordered this headset for making phonecalls to my friends and family in Europe over the internet and I am very happy with this product. You get a great deal for only a few dollars.However, I would not recommend this headset if you would like to use it for music, too. The sound quality of the headset is not outstanding. For music you would have to choose a more expensive one. But for voice recognition and IP-calls it is absolutely sufficient."
4,Great gift.,Looks great and is a good value. If you are looking to give a great gift that looks expensive and still fits your pocket book this is a winner.
4,What ON EARTH are you doing?,"A book to give that extra introduction of these important special subjects of geology. Pupils at school, first-year students at university and anyone interested in geology will find this a useful book about the world on which we live and its crust."
5,What a mighty woman the author is!,"She writes so well. Fascinating. It gave me wings to fly freely to see things down below. Michelangelo was great before she found him in his creation of beautiful male nudes. But even unknown sculptors come alive as great chiseled by aging. I agree with her that the beauty of the aging of stones defeating the aging of the flesh.In her poetic enthusiasm, she mixed up the age of Gherald Perini the model whose abrupt disappearance made the artist heart-broken so badly. According to her, Gherald had been immortalized as he had been painted on the vault of the Sistine Chapel as a shining young man. The fact is that when the ceiling was done by his brush-works, Perini had been barely born. He could not possibly have modeled for Michelangelo when was doing the master work."
1,"All it is, is a practice test!","It is not a study guide, and gives no real helpful tips. It is no help whatsoever for someone who has already taken the test and needs to retest for a better score."
2,agree with previous writer,What the previous writer wrote was absolutely true. Do not count on this book helping you for the NTE test. I bought this book and went over it. From it I thought the test would not be bad at all. How wrong I was. The test was MUCH tougher than this lightweight book let on. Don't buy it - go elsewhere for preparation.
2,The Craft is 10 times better!,I saw this film on Chillers TV and I thought it was just really cheesy! Ron Pearlman is a great actor espeically in TVs Beauty & The Beast & Hellboy & other films but the movie itself is just cheesy and it's one of the films I only watch once and can't get into it! But The Craft is way better than this!
2,Once was enough,"I actually had high ecpectations when I bought this movie even though the reviews weren't that good. I should have listened to the other reviewers. Weak story and the acting left a lot to be desired. If you have to see it, rent it or wait for it to hit the bargan bins."
2,Just average horror movie if that,"This Film, gets a D-. The only thing going for it was the cast of beauties. Poor Script, Dull acting, Tired old story line of good=god/ bad=devil. So don't waste your time or money like I did on this one, and pass._ Don't Buy."
2,~*~,"Basic plot outline: Five girls, each unwanted by the rest of society and each possessing a different supernatural ability, are sent away to reform at a Catholic School. They quickly realise something is wrong when it becomes clear they are the only students there and a ghost is seen roaming the halls.This film suffers from a badly explained plot and a cliche script. I found myself liking the characters, despite the fact that the acting at the start of the movie was pretty stiff. It does manage to be entertaining -but even those who are big fans of the supernatural will be happy enough to rent it rather than buy it."
1,Dumb beyond Imagination.,"Despite Ron Pearlman being in the movie this is strictly B-movie fare. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is laughable, and it's all executed with no skill in sight. Not even worth a rental. Normally, I would say more but in this case it's really not necessary. Honestly, just watch the almost incomprehensible introductory scene and you'll get my drift."
2,the dvd was mediocre but the movie is enjoyable enough,the dvd is terrible audiowise as the audio mix is 5.1 multi-stereo . not true surround at all and is overpowering . i recommend watching just with TV speakers or 2ch stereo setting on Home theaters. as the 5.1 is distracting .the movie is Ok but it might be hard to watch with such irritating audio.
5,A fun and exciting superhero book!,"I love the old time Spider-man shows and these Adam Troy Castro books bring out all the fun memories of wathing the old cartoons and reading the comic books.The title of the book is a little misleading, 90% of the book is about Mysterio and 10% is about the Gathering. Regardless of that it really is a great book. Plenty of action, plenty of plot and just a lot of fun to read. Mysterio is a very intriging and interesting villian. It was great to learn more about him. I think they could do a lot with him if they ever made a Spider-man movie with him as the main or at least one of the main villians.The only negative thing about this book is finding it. It's out of print... none of the libraries in my city (Salt Lake) had a copy. So I had to fork out $25 to buy a slightly used copy on Amazon. It was worth the price of admission.Enjoy!"
4,Parker has a sister... and her name is...,"This book is a pretty good book, but the mystery at the end is no mystery. Someone get me Adam-Troy Castro's email address!"
3,Too Much Mysterio,"The Gathering of the Sinister Six is over all a good book, but I think Adam-Troy Castro gave it the wrong title! It should have a title containing ""Mysterio"". I was looking forward to reading a great Sinister Six story, but it seemed like the Six was a side story, and the hole thing was about Mysterio! But don't take me wrong, Mysterio is one of my all time favorite villains, and the Gathering of the Sinister Six is a great book, but I think it should of had more of the Sinister Six in it!"
5,It's very complete !!!,"For lovers of the real salsa music, Cuban and Puerto Rico's music, this is a excelent book. Show the beginning of salsa, cha cha cha, mambo, plena, bomba, guajira, guaguanco, danzon, son, montuno and every rhythm about that times and the present, personally that's was and will be the best music; I don't like the music salsa of today, it's simple, abstract, don't have anything!!!I recommend this book."
4,Very satisfied so far,"This iPod replaces a hard disk mp3 player of another brand. I'm new to the iPod brand, but I've found this model to live up to the hype. Sleek design, easy to use (even in converting my WMA library to iTunes), and good performance. So far I'm very glad I made the switch to the iPod product line."
4,Execellent,"I own a 2gb ipod nano and I love it! Here's a list of pros and cons-Pros- very small + portiblestylish (for those who really care)holds a good amount of songs (500 or 1000)great quality soundbright and legible screenfun games and featuresCons- more fragile than a minisumdges EXTREMELY easily (something that drives me insane, even thouh I have a case)all in all, this is THE BEST mp3 player for a person with a $250 or less budget and cares more about size than capacity. When I took my new nano out of its box my mother gaped at it and said, ""That's it!? I paid how much for what?!"" (One must hold a nano to appericiate its size)She has since gotten over her shock."
3,Product Service,"Unfortunately, the original IPOD was broken within an hour of use. The cause of this was unknown. However, we are lucky enough to have an APPLE store nearby, made an appointment with a Tech who could not fix the IPOD, but the store was gracious enough to exchange it for a brand new one. Since then, all is well and the recipient is thoroughly enjoying it."
3,Too small?,"Great if you want something you can't even feel on you, but that's just it. It's so tiny you don't take time to admire it. If your thumb's even just slightly moist the touch wheel doesn't do jack. Works as promised however"
4,Awesome,awesome product. even better with a speck case. i got one and it had a loose click wheel. apple replaced it and its awesome.
4,He was very excited,I bought it for my 17 year old nephew and he was very excited! He has had no issues with it. It looks just like the current ones so there was no issues with it looking any different than the ones that cost a lot more. I'm happy with my purchase.
1,One bad Apple iPod,"This was by far my worst purchase experience ever at Amazon. The supposedly ""Factory Refurbished"" iPod did not work properly, had scratches/nicks on the case and I highly doubt it came from Apple. The process of getting my money refunded was too long. Their ""online live assistance"" is a sham, it does not even work. It took threats to get any response from the Seller. They totally misrepresented the product. I bought a current generation refurbished iPod (that looks and works like new) directly from Apple for the same price. I will never purchase anything else from this Seller."
2,Very poor,"The battery life for ipod is astoundingly poor and the nano is full of bugs. Mine keeps freezing and drains very quickly. Fed up with the problems, I have concluded to return it tomorrow and buy something else. I suggest you do the same. You will want something worth your money, the apple ipod clearly isn't. Buy something else."
5,8 GB iPod is great product,Bought ipod as a gift for my husband. Ipod is awesome. Easy to download music. Lots of memory. Very compact. Definately worth the money - in lieu of the 1st Generation ipod. Great product!
4,Compact listening device,The iPod is small and easy to use. The only thing is it skip some songs occassionally.
1,Don't buy from Ocean Reef Electronics,"While I would love to give a review on the iPod nano, the product sold by Ocean Reef Electronics is no longer working after 90 days. They refuse to replace the defective product and I for one will never purchase any product from them and would suggest Amazon discontinue any relationship with this seller. CAUTION to all who consider this retailer as you will get ripped off."
2,ok,This was our first apple purchase and I will never purchase a used item again! It did not come with any manual or instructions so it took us a while to figure it out. I will never try to save some $$$ buying a used item again! Better off buying it brand new!
5,very good condition.,"i had the same ipod nano but the screen cracked and i wasnt able to see anything on the screen. I was hesitant at first to buy this ipod, but it turned out to be a good buy. very minimal scratches. since it was shipping from hong kong. it was going to take about a month. it got to my house in a week. i was very satisfied. overall a great buy."
5,very good,"this is my first ipod and i did'nt know what an ipod is, but this is lithgter than the first generatión (i saw it in a store and i compare it) the shape is awesome and the sound is very good"
5,Love my iPod,"I just love my iPod. It took awhile to figure out the software, but I got it working. It's so small and light... very handy."
4,Nice Gift,"The Nano is very nice however it does not hold as many songs as promoted nor does it keep the charge as long as they say.. My son LOVES the Nano, it is small and has a good size screen. Amazon had the best price.I also bought the iPod Dock that was recommended and found out it is not necessary."
3,it could be better,This item is very nice and plays songs in a very good stereo sound but my problem with this item is the battery it does not last not even near the 14 hours they claimed to last. I hope the new nano is at leat close to the hours claimed.
5,Apple Are Geniuses!,"When i got this for Christmas ,I Thought it would Be only Good , But its EXCELLENT! i am Addicted to listening to this ,Also This MUCH better then Generation 1 ,It has MUCH better color of the screen ,And the Battery Lasts Double the amount then the 1st One. Buy one you WONT be Disappointed! :) Apple are ABSULUTE geniuses!"
3,a little frustrating,I must agree with it being counter intuitive. I have a Sansa and use Windows media player. The windows system is so easy. Windows has a simple column labled Sync that allows you to simply drag songs from the library into that column and press sync. Windows Media player is so logical and well laid out; not to mention very colorful (check it out). Ipod and I-tunes are frustrating. I hate that Ipod will not work with windows. The I tunes system needs to take a look at windows. Overall I recommend Sansa over Ipod. I gave it three stars because I compared it to another MP3 player I own.
5,In love with my i-nano,"I am just in love with my i-pod nano. It has surpassed my expectations in terms of the quality of the digital music, its dimensions (size and weight) and how friendly the user interface is. It is also extremely easy to download and delete musics using the i-tune software. Wonderful!"
1,dumb,this did not work dont bye it i cant downlode songs on it. i cant beleve that i did that i will never bye this agen.
3,Good for Commuting,I actually bought my Nano used (only 6 mo. old) from my brother-in-law upgrading to the iPod 80 gig. It holds all my songs but I've had to reformat as the songs began messing up - Never thought an audio file could run at higher speed. Think 45 rpm sped up to 78 rpm. Weird. I hated the iPod buds as they wouldn't stay in my ears. Wish I could delete songs direct from my iPod or at least when connected to my PC. Otherwise it helps alot with my dreary commute by train.
4,Awesome,"This is an awesome product. I bought a skin for mine to keep it cleaner and keep the screen nice (I am an outdoor person and use it all the time).Very good, very impressed."
5,Small Size - Big Features,"For such a small mp3 player, it is certainly packed with alot of extra features - including games, calendar, address book, stop watch, alarm, world clock and more.With 4 GB of storage, you can store around 1,000 songs and alot of photos. You can even view your photos as a slideshow, complete with transitions. The click-wheel is intuitive and easy to use.Battery-life has been improved (up to 24-hour playback now) from the 1st Generation Nanos and there is a handy on-screen battery indicator.The all-aluminum body feels solid in your hand and does not get scratched easily."
4,ipod nano 2nd generation,"I originally thought this one played videos too, but my daughter loves it. She has all her favorite songs and family pics and podcasts. It was so easy to use we didn't even need directions."
4,Apple iPod 2nd generation,"This iPod was used. It was in amazing condition--it didn't look like it had ever been out of the box. The only thing missing was the usb port, which we got from a friend. I was very pleased. My daughter, for whom it was for, was also very pleased and you know how picky 16 year olds are!"
5,"My ""Little"" Brother owns this, and has no major complaints, since He received it before X-Mas, in 2006. 4.5 stars.","And his complaints have been kept to a strict, strict minimum.I love the color (though I would prefer the blue one any day). It holds up to 1,000 songs (WMA-style, AAC-style and MP3-style. Possibly WMV-style, but I highly doubt the latter), has some games to play (I believe), and charges pretty fast.I really like the wheel you use to turn the volume up or down, and to toggle through all the menus and such. It also has the time and date, and I believe that you can listen to the radio also. I-Tunes is what you would normally use to get music files and pictures onto this thing, and at first I was wary about using it, but it's awesome. You can burn a CD in 2.5 minutes, flat!I would fully recommend this device.There's little that you wouldn't like about it.4.5 stars."
4,nice,"it is a great piece of engineering, the only thing i would want from such a state of the art electronics is more and affordable gigs for memory, but it is exactly what you pay for, sleek and easy to handle"
1,Bought used quit in a few,"I have a diferent ipod previously and it is great. I bought this one used and it was dead in 1 week. I will not buy an ipod used again, it is not worth it. The Nano in general is a good product, just not the one I got stuck with by buying used, you never know the abuse."
5,Pink ipod,I ordered this pink ipod nano for my neice for Christmas. She loves it and the sound quality is great! I highly recommend this product!
2,Can't turn it off!,"I have one of these. It worked fine for a few months, but then the on/off button started having problems. Sometimes I just can't turn it off. I will think twice before I buy an Apple product next time."
3,boo Apple,"The device itself is nice, but iTunes is not worth the hassle. Find another mp3 player that has a more user friendly interface to manage what's on it. The ipod comes with very little instructions and is not intuitive at all."
5,A great way to smile,"The 8GB iPod is an excellent product which does what it claims to do. Promising to store 2000 songs I have found that claim conservative. Although most of my songs are longer than ""average"" i.e. folk, blues, I have more than 2200 songs on my Pod and still have a little room left for additional tracks. It is well thought out although its indexing songs leaves a little to be desired, placing many albums under ""Compilations"" and other quirks. Additionally, it would be helpful to have an expanded EQ to fine tune sound quality for particular ears, or phones.The included phones are of good sound quality but not easy to keep in the ear. Optional phones can always be purchsed. All said, however, this is an excellent product which will bring much pleasure to its users."
5,Like DUH...what could I possible add?,Another satisified Steve Jobs Customer. We are an Apple family. Love all the products. Amazon is the best bar none with all aspects of their service. Thanks much.
4,Excellent,"Excellent product from Apple. This was the first MP3 player I have ever bought and it works great. It would be nice if Apple would include better directions for how to load songs and be more specific on things, the earbuds don't fit the ears that great and I had to buy different ones for exercising, but overall a great product that works."
2,Paying Too Much,"Honestly, I think that buying an Ipod is just buying something for the brand name. I have a 6GB Creative MP3 player that is the same cost as this. So what if you can play solitare on an Ipod? I would suggest buying a Creative MP3, they are quality MP3 players that will get more bang for you buck!"
1,DISASTER,WORDS TO DESCRIBE SELLER AND TRANSACTION? UNHELPFUL; EVASIVE; UNSYMPATHETIC ...Item never delivered - seller insists it was - proof of delivery proved it was'nt!! Seller refused to help referring me to Amazon.I won't be doing business with this seller again - it is up to you to make your own judgement.
1,After reading all of these BAD reviews...,"Wow, all of the trouble with these Ipods! I was considering buying one for my 13 year old daughter for Xmas but, after all of the scratching issues, the dead battery issues, the battery life issues, the problems with iTunes crashing home PCs, etc., etc... I think I'll look elsewhere for sure!"
4,Nano Rocks,the ipod nano is one of the best ipods around. It is tiny which makes it better and it is at a good price:200$ for 2 gigs and 250$ for 4 gig.
4,Ipod Mini ordeal,"I bought 2 ipods mini (one for me -blue- and one for my wife -green-)At 6 months the blue one completely died (apple sent me a new one without charge -great!)Six months later the battery died so I use the blue one as a hard disk or connected to a JBL device to play it. My gentle wife gave me hers and a few weeks later I began having trouble with the battery again (nightmare). It says ""out of power"" even though I fully chraged it for hours. I found out that if i hit the device it would start again. As i do not care if i destroy this thing I will use it this way. I did not charge it 1000 times as Apple stated. I am getting a 4gb nano hoping that I will not live this again. If this happens again I will buy a radio and forget obout Apples ipod for good (cost to learn this lesson: US$700)"
1,Disappointed,Never received my iPod nor did I receive a response from the sender in regards to where my iPod was. The only way to get the tracking number was through the sender b/c Amazon did not have it which makes no sense since I purchased it through Amazon. I just was not pleased with the entire situation.
1,WORST!!,I paid almost $200.00 for this item and NEVER recieved it. I then contacted Amazon to get my money back and went and bought it at Wal-mart. At least they give it to you. I am very dissapointed in Amazon for working with the Rainmaker Group.
3,Good product...but not for its price,"I've researched this product, seen reviews, and I see that this is a nice MP3 player. But think people, why spend $240 on this when theres a 5.5 Generation 30 GB iPod video waiting around for $250? I know that the video one is a hard drive based MP3 player, and it's a bit wider, but what's the difference?"
1,Ipod Nano,"Hi, I dont know what happen with the ipod nano, never can use it. I try reading slowly the owners manual and not foud solution. First appear an exclamation, after dont turn on."
1,Watch Out for Used IPods,"I had a new one of these for many years, and it was excellent until it got water-damaged, so I know this is a quality product. However, the used one I bought through Amazon is terrible. The battery will not stay charged, rendering it useless as a ""portable"" device. You also have to push the buttons really hard to get a response. I am very dissatisfied with this seller, The Great IPod Exchange. I would not recommend buying a used IPod."
1,Two in under 2 years,"I reall tried to give 0 stars but Amazon wouldn't let me. This is anothe sneaky Apple gimmick to get you to spend your cash. There are so many little things Apple doesn't disclose to the consumer I am amazed they are still in business. After spending my $150.00 on the Nano, taking excellent care of it and not overusing it at all, barely touching the thing, the scroll wheel fizzled out and the software quit. I took it to an Aplle store where they wanted to charge me $100.00 to ""fix"" it. After a brief argument, they ended up just giving me a new (probably refurbished) one which has lasted under 6 months. How is it possible that it can charge overnight and then it only plays for 20 minutes? What's worse is that I couldn't get my ITunes to sync with the new 'pod. Itt was going to wipe the music off completely. Sour Apple. Time for a name change to promote the truth about your overpriced, substandard products."
4,Apple 2GB Nano,"I needed a rugged MP3 player for jogging and travel. So far the nano has fit the bill (I 've used the device since July 2006). The ergonomics is satisfactory, but over rated. The touch wheel doesn't always respond as expected, and the iTunes softway disapoints if you're expecting a completely intuitive user interface. I originaly had a player from Creative, it stopped working twice and had to be exchanged by the seller. Its software was at best cluggy, would work with one of my computers, but not with the other. I had to download different software for different computers...bad quality all around."
5,Absolutely the best mp3 player there is,"I tried many players, but this 2nd generation Apple iPod Nano is my favorit. The player is very small, the battery lasts very long, the screen is bright and there are practical functions for storing calendar, alarms, addresses. There are Games (I never need them), and I very like the clock that can be set to show different times of different locations. There is even a search function where you can search for music titles with a specific letter or even word. And there are so many third party products out there that are compatible with the iPods. Have you heard about that Zune from Mircrosoft? Probably not, well, forget it anyway, the iPod's are much better in any aspect."
4,iPod Nano 2 GB,"Good sound quality, very compact, impressive battery life. However, the standard earphones seem unable to handle the top volume of music without the music being distorted. The memory is rather limited, but you get what you pay for. Buy the 4 GB if you need the space. Oh, and the black one gets scratched VERY easily."
5,PERFECT!!!!!,"This is the greatest purchase I've made in the last year. I carry it all the time, it's the best exercise partner I've had. The only thing I regret is that I should have gotten the 4GB one... maybe it's just me but I just want to have all my music in my ipod now, I don't want deal with cd's anymore..."
5,Pleased as Punch,"I am writing this review in order to let the public know, That you too can have practically brand new items for half the cost. The product I ordered was a Apple Ipod (2Nd Generation) when I recieved it, I was very impressed. my Ipod is like New & plays perfect. I Highly recommend this sit to anyone. Patricia"
2,misled?,"I am disappointed in the product as it is obviously not a NEW, unopened nano--as advertised--but looks to be a re-packaged used and/or refurbished product."
4,"Handsome, slim and quirky","This is the 3rd iPod I've owned - and the best so far. It is very slim, the screen is bright and crisp, and the aluminum is a definite upgrade over the previous Nano. Two minor irritants are that the black color can/will chip away (especially near the top and bottom edges) and I have to reset the iPod (by pressing and holding the top part of the click wheel and the center button) often due to frequent freezing. Irritating yes, but not deal breakers by any stretch. It's great for workouts and general on the go activities. The flash based RAM is much more stable than the larger HD-based video iPods."
4,Great Product but unsure of reliability,"Bought a black one for my teenager. She absolutely loved it and the features are wonderful. However, it started to malfunction a few weeks later and eventually stopped working completely. I have heard a lot of other people complain of similar problems. We returned and bought another, so far no problems."
3,"Lovely, Functional, but...............","I love my Nano. Everything a mp3 player should be is what the Nano is and then some. It is small so it doesn't draw that much attention when I am standing at the bus stop. It is fuctional because it isn't bogged down with ""bells and whistles"" it plays music, keeps time (clock and calendar) and holds pictures. Overall it is the best mp3 player I have ever had (I had many).However, the battery life isn't as long lasting. The battery is usually zapped after 8 hrs of play (at least the one I have does) with the backlight off and volume about half way. I would have given 4 or 5 stars but the battery is my biggest issue.If you get one check it out and if the battery isn't functioning as advertised, request that Apple fix it. You have about 90 days from the day of purchase to have it fixed at no charge to you."
3,It's okay,"I like Ipod and their ideas, but this one doesn't work at times. I bought it to go with the Nike hook-up, so for the reason of jogging alone, it works okay."
3,apple 4 gb ipod,I had a problem with this ipod & had to send it back to Express. I am waiting for a replacement.
3,Apple 4GB ipod nano review,I would of liked to know that this product had a small dent in it before purchasing as well as that it has a glitch in the software for clicking next when moving from one song to the next.
3,Item was exaclty as described,Just got this item today. It does what an mp3 player should do. I think they are overpriced though. For what it does you can get cheaper mp3 players that basically do the exact same stuff.
2,"Capable, but not great","I have had this model (8 GB red) for about 10 months now. I should have learned my lesson from my last iPod, but I liked the size and bought it anyway. I definitely give it credit for size and look, however, the battery life is not as advertised. I have never had the life that they advertise and if anything it seems to be decreasing. It is a continual frustration I have had with apple products so beware. Nice design....average execution. In some ways the product seems to have cheapened over time. Switches are not quite as substantial, the screen seems to be very prone to damage and I am doing everything I can to keep it from scratching. Additionally, like many apple products, it is a sexy product but lacking in some features."
3,"new nano, I feel like catch 22, new 4G Nano for the same price as my 2G (Sept purchase) with no compensation???",Purchased 2G Nano for the same price as the new 4G Nano Sept. with no compensation? not happy!
4,"Really good product, small amount of problems","This is a really nice product. I've had mine for around six months now, and I use it pretty much every day. It has a few glitches, like every once in a while it will have trouble fastforwarding or it will act funny for a second, then return to normal once I turn it on then off again, but overall, I couldn't really ask for a better product. All electronics pretty much have their glitches, but I feel good about my buying it. It is quality over quantity."
3,just what i wanted,i specifically got the ipod nano because i wanted an ipod with a long battery life. the nano definitely reached my expectations.however i've only had it for a couple of weeks and it already froze on me. i hope this doesnt continue and that the nano lasts longer than a year.
4,good,I got one the first one i got it soon gave out . i shipped it back and they gave me a new one . and that one works very good.
3,Outstanding device - Bad Software,"I gave this a three because the Software that is used to synch this Nano i.e., iTunes is very confusing, especially for people who use Windows a lot. I hope Apple comes up with a better software for windows users."
1,WORST PURCHAESE EVER,"This is the worst thing I have ever bought. I like iPods but this is just terrible. I had it for a day and it already had like 100 scratches on it. Like I said I like iPods, but this thing is as shame to apple"
3,Need better marketing people,"I finally broke down and bought one of these, based on recommendations by fellow musicians. I wish the people who make these devices would be more aware that people other than 19 year old mindless fans of pop music are interested in carrying around their personal music collections. I was TOTALLY turned OFF by i-pod in the past because the advertising focuses on downloading ""songs"" from their i-tunes, etc... Does that mean I can download over 500 symphonies, operas, or piano concertos, too? I wish they'd clarify what 500 ""songs"" means. Is a five hour opera one ""song?"" I will find out when I get the thing in the mail. But, at any rate, I wish they'd rethink their marketing, and try to cater to a wider public, rather than the uneducated masses. And, by the way, a symphony, piano piece, chamber work, etc. is not a ""song!"" Thanks for letting me spew. Fed up with pop music, and those that perpetuate it...."
1,$400?!?!?!,$400 for a 2nd gen nano???? what a RIP-OFF amazon! you can buy th 3rd gen for half the price! buy the newer nano. don't buy this one!
5,Coool,"On my birthday,I got the GREATEST gift ever.A black iod nano!!!When I opened the box,i saw this gleaming,sleek,tiny ipod.Of course,everyone wanted to see it.Now, 1 year and 183 songs later,i gotta say,Wow.it can hold 500 songs,pictures,audiobooks,and,entire CDs.Plus it looks cool.it takes a while to charge,but its fun.its durable too,so you can go anywhere with it.All in all,5 out of 5."
4,what did I do for music before,"I absolutely love having the ability to take my music with me with my iPod nano, though if I had to do it all over again, I would consider upgrading to the 4 GB. It's amazing how quickly 500 tracks add up!"
3,Good,"It was good, came with everything it was suppose to have. And nicely packed. Nice doing business with you."
3,no no nano,I bought this nano for my wife. She really enjoys using it. I gave it a moderate review because of all the set-up that is needed in order to be able to use it. Apple Corp. could have made it much easier to download information into it from their web site. It seems to me they are more interested in selling you music than they are helping you understand how to use the nano.
3,Fragile,"ipod nano is a beautiful one, the screen is so beautiful, and the touch-wheel is very good and so is the sound. But it is SO expensive, and you need itunes!! It also gets dirty easily, and you get finger prints all over it soon, and when it's scratched, it looks so weird. It's also very fragile."
1,I've finally learned a VERY expensive lesson,"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me ""sorry, tough luck."" I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG!Second ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't).Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product. I'm just sorry that it didn't last (twice!) cause otherwise I'd be a fan."
2,It's good...yet bad,This ipod is pretty much a shrunk down version of the ipod photo. It does all the same things including playing music and slide shows. There of course are a few problems. For one the ipod scratches like no other. If you barley even touch you will see a mark on the body. Just a minor touch to the screen makes a mark that is easily visible. Another problem wiht the ipod is that it cracks in half easily. My friend sat down with it in his pocket and it cracked in half rigth down the middle. All in all I have to say that I just don't like this ipod. I do know that you can buy a case for it but it costs almost 30 dollers to buy a case that isn't that good. I would highly recomend buying the new ipod that can play videos.
5,8 GB Ipod Black-2nd generation,"This Ipod Nano was a christmas present for my son. He already had an ipod shuffle, but it was worn out. Needless to say we already had the Itunes installed on our pc. We spent hours christmas day trying to install the new Ipod. The problem was he wasnt using the cord that came with it!! So make sure you use the cord that comes with your ipod!! Other than that it is great and he is really enjoying it!!!!!( The cord he was using was an extra that we had bought never thinking it wouldnt work with the Ipod.)"
4,"Very nice, but no excuse for the easy scratching","It looks great, it sounds great, it has go-anywhere-but-in-the-water practicality. But there is no longer any excuse for Apple to make iPods that scratch as soon as you get them out of the box. There are now clear, scratch-proof coatings, such as the clear DURABIS polymer TDK has invented for blank DVDs, and Apple should be using them. iPods would keep their cool factor for a lot longer if they didn't get scratched up so quickly. Early reports suggest that the battery life meets the product specs, but it is important to keep an eye on this since Apple is not famous for being forthcoming about battery performance. iPod battery life has never been impressive at its best."
4,Very nice...but the price?,"This thing holds 2 GB of data. This equals about 250 songs. ""What only 250? There are way better mp3 players with way more memory!"" Let's face it. Who listens to 250 songs a day, even a week? If you want to hear new stuff, how long does it take to add and delete songs? I have over 4,000 songs on my computer, and this thing works just fine. I don't think anyone needs more than 2 GB of data. Yeah, changing songs every day can be a hassle, but there's no need to go any higher. The only thing that I see as a problem is the price. You could buy the 20GB Photo for only a hundred more dollars. The math for the prices is not linear. The 20GB should cost 10 times that of the Nano since its hard drive is 10 times bigger, or better yet the Nano should cost a tenth of the 20GB, making it about $30. Just a thought, Apple."
4,Great!,"I've had this model of ipod for 6 years (I got it for Christmas 2005), and I think it's fantastic! I tholds around 500 songs, still looks almost new, is sleek, has amazing battery life and looks just as good as it did when I opened the box! While it may not have the best features and it can't play video, it is a great piece of audio hardware. In fact, it beats many of my friends' ipod battery life, even in Gen. 4+ ipods! In short, I think this is a fantastic music player!"
4,It's a very good product.,"I like it's small size and light weight. It's convenient to carry. At the same time, it's easy to use and there's enough space so that you can download lots of beautiful music. I'd like to introduce this product to others."
3,Great battery life! Poor cust. service!,"Battery lasts days not hours. However, Apple has POOR customer service. When I called in for help getting my songs on the ipod they told me I had to sign up for customer service which was like $50/yr."
1,Didn't work!*,"I recorded songs onto it and tucked it into my pocket for a 6-mile run on a cold day. By the end of the run, it had decided not to work. It's at the MAc doctor now, and I'm waiting for a verdict. Very disappointing to pay 250.00 then have the product not produce."
1,frozen ipod,the ipod i have recieved never worked properly. getting it repaired with Apple was not the easiest experience.
1,Flimsy junk,"I left the plastic film on to protect the front from getting scratched, but it still broke after two months. No sound, picture or power - what gives?Don't pay just for the Apple name - buy a better mp3 player for half the price and double the build quality"
1,Wasted my money,"I have had my IPod for a year now and I am so unhappy with it. The earbuds are too big and painful, I cannot turn it off immediately so the batteries wear down quickly, and I cannot choose the songs I want to hear. I have looked online to see if there is any explanation why I have these problems but nothing short of buying a new one seems to be the answer. I have no idea why I can't hear half of the songs that I downloaded onto it, but when I put it on ""Shuffle"" it just skips over most of the songs."
5,Awesome Nana iPod,I just ordered a black 2gb nana from these people and it rocks. I ordered next day air and it shipped on time. It is in perfect condition straight from the factory and has everything with it. I love my nano and recommend that everyone buy one from these people. They are honest and sell great items in great condition.
2,NOT user friendly,This item is NOT user friendly by any means! To get music on it is the biggest pain the neck! It's ssoooooo much easier to just go by the CD and carry a radio with you. I don't understand why everyone likes these things...uuuuggg
5,Forget The 3rd Gen,"I waited for the 3rd gen nano to be released to purchase the 2nd gen(cheaper) and replace my 1st gen nano. Extremely small, great sound, and plenty of space for my music. Happy with purchase."
5,My 1st IPOD,"This is the 1st IPOD I've ever had, and i've been using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago (for gym, work, commuting, planes). No real problems so far. The size is excellent, the look is sheek, and the navigating wheel is a lot easier to use than I was told it was going to be. Battery life is not too bad, i would say it can be used for about 10 hours before the battery picture turns red. I am dissapointed by the capacity- 500 songs is really NOTHING for people who've been buying CDs for 10+ years and enjoy variation in their listenting sessions. I was also dissapointed that you can't do anything with playlists on the IPOD itself- basically everything (eg, creation of playlists, deletion of songs, moving around of songs) has to be done on the computer & uploaded to the IPOD. Recommended for gym-goers and frequent travelers."
1,Poor battery quality - a real bummer,"While it looks functional, unfortunately this little guy has an extremely low battery life - making it practically useless. I have not yet explored getting this fixed but imagine that once I do, I will end up having paid quite a bit more - ultimately not saving the money that I thought I would.Too bad!"
2,No Directions for use,I was very disappointed that this Ipod which I gave to my husband as a birthday gift came without a book of directions for use.
2,"Bad for jogging, short battery life","The user interface is thought out well for people in a stationary position, but is useless for jogging.It is impossible to switch songs or change the volume while moving. You bump the click wheel the wrong way and end up cranking up the volume when you just wanted to skip to the next song. Several times the next song would come on and be too loud (despite using the automatic volume normalizing feature in iTunes), I would hit the click wheel and get stuck on the main menu page. So I'd have to take my headphones out, wait for the menu to disappear, only then would I be able to turn the volume back down. They really should have a ""jogging mode"" that just isolates the click wheel to have four ""regions"" that you just have to touch for changing songs and adjusting volume, much like the Shuffle has...which is what I'm buying instead.The battery life was pretty dismal too, but that has already been discussed in other reviews."
2,im not a kid but oh my goodness.....apple could do so much better,"this is a cool mp3 player, so darn small, but it broke in half when i accidently dropped it!! it scraches so easily too. but wow, breaking in half! make a tougher ipod next time, apple."
1,Apple Customer Service is for the birds,"I purchased this ipod for my daughter as a christmas gift. The setting up of the ipod can be very confusing and frustrating but once that part was over she has really enjoyed the ipod. PROBLEM: Thier customer service bites, we have had problems on and off and really have not had any helpful guidance from apple custumer service. Recently her ipod was dropped and I sent it away to be repaired (paid the 30.00! shipping fee) and it has been returned to me because it is not covered on warranty. They won't even tell me what is wrong with it, I now have to drive over an hour to an apple store to find that out. Why charge 30.00 if I can't even recieve a report of what is wrong with it an an estimated repair cost."
1,Product with problem,The Ipod nano was received on time (faster than expected) but it came with imperfections. The forward and play buttons were not working. I had to return the item to the manufacturer and I'm still waiting back for it.
4,IPOD NANO,"CLEAR MUSIC,JUST WISH THAT IT HAD MORE SPACE ON IT.BUT VERY PORTABLE,AND HAS MANY ACCESSORIES AVAILABLE FOR IT."
4,Ipod Nano,Good product. But I bought it as a present to someone who can not see... there is virtually no support for someone who uses only hands and ears to navigate thru the iPod's menus.
1,unhappy,Was not expecting to have to deal with all the issues I had with this ipod. Unfortunately did not work for me.
5,Easy to Use,"I am a grandmother and I like the idea that your site was easy to use and the product was also easy to understand, thank you"
5,iPod is amazing,"It is a great tool to have for my long commute each morning. I love putting audio books on it, kick back and just have people read to me while I fight traffic."
4,I was an anti-iPod for a long time,"For quite awhile I was very much anti-iPod and would regularly spout off about how evil they were and how I would never own one. Then I found my Rio broken after a few months due to a fall and the 2nd generation of Nanos being released and, more importantly, a PINK IPOD. I was in love. You see, pink, especially hot pink, is by far my favorite color. I figured that they can't be that bad and now that I own it and I've used it I see exactly why people are drawn to the iPod, it's easy to use once you adjust to the wheel. It makes an excellent microphone, preferably when you're alone. All around I wouldn't say it's that terrible of a product and I am considering the iPhone when it comes out as a result of my iPod experience."
4,Wife loves it.,I purchased the 4g Nano for my wife for xmas. She just loves it. it's compact and functional. She had a Minni which she handed down to our daughter. this was a good buy. Battery life seems to be excellent.
5,No major flaws. Very user-friendly software.,"I have only been using this product for a few months, so no reliability info. But it's supposed to be much more reliable than the hard-drive based video iPod. Sometimes it jumped to the next song before the end of a song. Other than that, no other problems with the device so far. At home, I connected it to my home stereo system using a Nyko Stereo Link cable through the iPod connector. The bass is much stronger than the sound coming from the earphone jack. I dropped it a couple of times, but luckily the iPod was protected inside a Contour Design iSee clear case. The case also made the iPod look more beautiful. The iTune is very easy to use. I rippped all my classical music CDs using Apple lossless decoder. So I could only store about 30 CDs, and swapped different playlists every few weeks. Have not played my CD player since I bought the iPod. Interestingly, I listen to music much more often than before. Highly recommended."
4,iPod Nano 2 GB,"Overall, very enjoyable, sleek design and easy to use. Wish I had waited for next generation release (a month or so after purchase) to get lower price during transition. Could get a few more things included for the cost, but the value is good."
5,Finally....,I had been wanting an IPOD since last year. I finally received it for Christmas. I was so excited. I have fun adding my music to it. It just amazes me that this little thing can hold so much music. I am also having fun shopping for the right accessories. LOVE IT!!! Wish I had gotten one sooner.
2,A lot worse than described,"I liked the fast shiping, but in the review it said 'like new' and it looks pretty beat up. Its all scratched and bitten from a side. The iPod works fine, so I didn't want to waste my time returning it and calling, but i will not buy from this seller again."
2,See for yourself,I am happy about how I was treated by the seller of this product when I was not happy with the outcome.
4,Its Good and Simple,I have been using this product for the past 6 months. I am very happy with the performance and Clarity and Quality of music. The only thing I wished is an easier way to charge it.
3,Not entirely satisfied,"The features and ease of use make this an interesting product, however mine had to be replaced after only two weeks of use. One of the audio channels did not work. Quality control could be better."
3,"Its Good, But...","I got the iPod nano 2gb as a congratulation gift from my aunt for getting into a good high school. It works great but the only thing i have to complain about is the battery. the battery life will keep getting shorter after a couple of charges. if it gets real short before the 1 year waranty ends apple will send you a new ipod nano. but if the waranty expires, you have to buy another ipod.Pro-Small. I mean REALLY SMALL!!!-You can download MAD songs.-MAD EASY TO DOWNLOAD-The price is pretty affordable.Cons-The battery-The accesaries cost about $30.Otherwise, the ipod nano is da shit"
3,Bad shipping... Good ipod...,"I had recently bought a ipod nano 2gb like 2 days ago, gave me a eta of 2-3 days till it gets to my house, now its like 6 more days till it comes to my house.. wowo horrible shipping, takes too long i should of just ordered from apple directly, might be 20$ more but still faster shipping and free engraving."
1,Worthless piece of...,"My experience with IPod went ok for the first few months even though I hated the proprietary format that force you to convert all your mp3 and wma formats to apple format which is tedious, then suddenly the player stopped working 1 week after the warranty expired, so the store told me to take it to an apple store maybe they can help, after waiting 45 minutes to talk to one of the employees there(at the Genius Bar!!) the genius dude checked the player and told me it's a hard drive failure, and can't do anything about it but if I wanted I could get 10% off on my next IPod purchase however since I don't enjoy pain I bought a creative player instead which has more and better features than IPod less the hype..., when I was exiting the store a thought occurred to me that thank god my desktop and laptop at home were not apple products! And god bless Microsoft for saving the world after all from Apple tyranny and Unix Vi ."
2,lot of work and little reward,"I recieved the nano as a gift on Christmas. I have a large CD collection so I didn't have to bother with the music store. It took a good 20hrs over a week to copy the songs I wanted to the computer and then transfer them to the nano.Then I went out and purchased the proper cables to hook it up to my stereo. I also purchased the fm transmitter for my car and the power adapters for my car and home. Also got a rubber case to prevent it from scratching.Didn't drop it, or let the battery die. Plugged it into the charger, turned it off and went to sleep. When I woke up the next morning on February 13th it would not respond its completely dead. It was plugged into a surge protector with my cell phone and computer. They both work fine but the nano is dead.I guess the battery burned out. Yet there is no way to replace it without returning it to the manufacturer. I will try to return it to the store for a replacement but I hope this isn't a reoccuring problem."
1,Unbelievable,Can you believe it? I have had this just short of a month and it already does not function properly. I have been unable to turn it off and cannot do so after repeated attempts. I still have my receipt and am taking it to an apple store to see if either they can fix it or give me a new one. I hope they do because if they dont I will swear off apple and ipods forever. I thought these things were a bit sturdier and I have barely used mine and have treated it very carefully. Shoddy.
1,nano i-pod,if I could give this customer a minus I would. I never received this product. Contacted the seller twice. Had to receive a refund from Amazon. Whatever you do don't buy from them.
1,Bad decisions from apple,1) The ipod nano does not have recording ability2) The ipod nano is too fragile3) The ipod nano is only $60 less than a real ipod.Do not waste your money on an ipod nano.
4,There is a reason Apple is #1,"Fantastic. The screen is crisp and clear. I bought this for my wife. I have an Ipod Mini. I think the sound from the Nano is actually better, it is ""richer"". You may ask why I didn't give it 5 stars? My Mini was about $200 and is 4 gig. The Nano is about $200 for the 2 gig or $250 for the 4 gig. If you are considering this item, I would recommend that you spend the extra money and buy the 4 gig model, rather than the 2 gig. I have a number of podcasts, which use up a lot of space, my wife doesn't. So, the 2 gig seems to fit her needs just fine. But, I think most people would be happier with the 4 gig model. Hat's off to Apple for putting together this fantastic product!!"
3,The name is the hype,"The big name in Mp3 players, and since its the center of hype among them, most of what you're paying for is the name. It does what its supposed to when its working. I could have gone to Wal-Mart and bought a 1Gb Mp3 player and work just as good, if not better. Ive owned the older style Nano which was a 2Gb, and this one. It sometimes resets itself midsong, and ive noted this 5-6 times. Maybe its the software inside thats causing the fowl up. Its not a bad Mp3 player, but if you're not a heavy user, and use it just for the gym and/or while you're on the bus to work, id settle for something cheaper."
1,Accessories missing,"I got this for my friend's birthday but was surprised to see that all the accessories were missing from the box. I called the company people and they send me but when I opened the packet, the accessories were not original (Apple) but they had send me some local stuff. Not at all satisfied with the service. Will not take another chance to buy anything from Tech Less."
1,Chutzpa!,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM AT THE LISTED PRICE. The price is beyond hyperinflated, something I didn't think possible. If you are looking to be ripped off there is a bridge in Brooklyn I'm sure they can sell you."
1,Rip Off???,How do you justify selling these at this price? The 3rd generation is now out and sell for much less than you are attempting to sell a 2nd generation product. You can purchase a 8 gig with video for under $200.00. I hope no one is purchasing these from you at this price of over $280.00.
5,As advertised,product came as advertised. product was more reasonable priced than anywhere else I had checked.
4,apple nano,"Bought this for my nephew it was a gift. was alittle sceptical, But Amazon has been good to me. I wish you could have seen the look on his face when he opened it! Priceless!! ( Oh! & yes it works GREAT!!) thanks ~ donna"
3,Mixed Feelings,"I received this item for christmas. I am using it primarily for running and at the gym. It has some good features; high capacity, light weight, nice look. However, I have found the controls to be akward in many situations. The control dial is to sensitive, and the controls are not easy to navigate while running. I added the Nike+ system and have had poor results. Specifically, the menus are confusing, and the sensitive controls often leave me on pause during a workout or have my workout being logged when I don't want it to be. I've had to re-load the operating system twice as I keep getting errors. I also found when you turn the unit off, it will not come back on again until it is docked. There is no manual included, you have to go online to figure out how to use it. In all it has potential, but it is not easy to use right out of the box."
4,"Too small screen, but good battery life",Bought this just before the new series came out and would have gone for new Nano for sure. Overall a great product that everybody should have.
4,sister loves it,"this took a month to fiqure out, came with chines only directions, had to go to website and work on reconfiquring.My sister has it all fiqured out, and sasy she likes it... the house is moving to elctronic/digital music."
5,greatest thing ever,"i could have sworn i dropped this thing more than 100 times, it still works as good as new, i only have to charge it every 3 days and i always listen to it, its light, easy to excercise with, and easy to use, in one word its amazing, buy it!"
4,Good Gift,I got this for my birthday. The sound is good and it's easy to load music.Yet the screen is small and the ipod itself scratches easily so get a cover too.Plus the dial button is very sensitive to touch.You have to touch lightly or the dial goes crazy.
4,Great product!,I am so glad I bought the 2gb iPod instead of the 4gb one. I would not have used the extra space and I saved over $50. I would have put 5 stars but it stalled once and I had to reset it.
3,iPod Nano....i suggest reconsidering,"it's a great product ....idon;t want to frieghten you.... but it has a great possiblity of sanpping in half. scratches are easily visible and it's just tooooo smalll...Yeah!!!Also the memory is too small. It's very stylish and is still an iPod. The sreen is tooo small and it is pretty good, don't get me wrong. I suggest saving up a little more money and buying the iPod Photo or using that money for the Zen Micro but that's just me!!"
4,It's alright,Got one for Christmas. One of the only downers is how easily the face gets scratched up. Other than that it's been serving me well. Get the extended warranty just in case.
5,"Very Small, But VERY Good","I received this for my birthday and turned out to be the only one in my school with it until Christmas cam and EVERYONE got it. This iPod has very good sound quality and its screen is very clear. It is easy to carry around and if you have a case, don't be afraid that you'll lose it. It is easy to use and the roller thing is very sensitive to everything. Because it is so litte, it sometimes gets lost. It also scratches very easily. On the first day, it was all in scratches and looked really bad until Christmas cam and my brother got me a case from Target. Now it is safe and free from scratches. I am happy to have gotten this for my birthday."
2,very bad quality,when i bought this product it says it was display ipod's and wasn't any damage to the product what so ever.. The ipod i received looked like a dog literally was chewing on the thing. I wouldn't recommended ever doing business with this person
2,Beware Nano Screen Problems!!,"Bought my wife a Nano for her birthday about a year ago. She takes it to work in a case in her purse or has it on her desk at home. For some unknown reason, the screen developed a spiderweb crack across it, and it's now unuseable. Worse yet, although its less than 1 year since I gave it to her, it is just over a year since it was purchased. Apple's service refuses to help, but will gladly sell me a new one. After encountering the problem with the screen and the not so wonderful service, I've now encountered SEVERAL people having the same problems with their nano screens. You might consider a cheaper, more reliable MP3 from Creative."
3,Ipod nano details,The product was shipped in excellent condition.. But I did not get the installation CD with it.. And the CD is absolutely essential for the ipod.
1,Not Worth the Plastic its Made From,"I bought an iPod Nano the first week of December, by the end of the first week, the screen was ruined and I was forced to take it back and get a new one. It has been about a month and a half now, and the new iPod I received is also now not working. I do not recommend one to anyone, as the agony it has caused is not worth it. Rather than buying someone an iPod I would recommend instead buying them a cd player that you can use .mp3 CDs with."
2,So easy to scratch you wished it was an itch!,"I saw it. I loved it. I wanted it. I paid $250 for it. It ordered it engraved. I finally got it. I loved it even more. It looked good. It sounded good. It was exactly as advertised. Until. Until the second day. It was scratched so badly you would think some cat had a fever. If you have to have one, get a sleeve for it first. Don't open the box until you get a sleeve! Then be sure you use the softest cloth possible to put it in its sleeve. Then never, ever take it out of its sleeve. In a sleeve, it may not look as cool as the product you bought but it won't have any scratches on it. Well at least not as many. At least then you'll be able to see the screen. Apple is usually a pretty good manufacturer but I haven't a clue how this product got by their quality control department."
2,I loved it. But...,"Not only did iTunes fail to work/update properly and freeze my computer on several occasions, but my LCD is *wrecked* now after keeping it in a small change-purse type of bag (alone, to avoid scratches) in my purse. I guess it knocked against something, but I can't pinpoint an occasion where it would have.I can't get a refund or repairs with the LCD damage (despite it only being 3 months old), and while it still plays, I can't see if I'm on the menu or the songs - so it drives me crazy.It was really fun while I had it though, despite getting scratched a lot. All I can say is READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. If you think this might happen to you, decide.... is it worth it to pay 200 dollars for 3 months use?"
4,Be Sure To Use Protection!,"I agree with most of what everyone has said. The Nano is great for the gym and the casual music listener. But my god, look at the thing wrong and it scratches. I'm very careful with my things but when the cord from the provided headphones can scratch the screen that's pretty sad. Mine already has several scratches and I've only used it twice. I eventually put the sticker from the original box back on the screen. This thing definitely requires protection."
1,Poor quality and Poor Customer Service!,"We brought two Nanos, both went bad (LCD) within 6 months. Got 2 replacements, and then the 2 replacements were sent back again. Can't believe the quality is this poor! On top of that, the CS was really bad. I had one unit sent back and forth 5 times! You could not email them, called the 800 number, was on hold (being transferred) for over 45 minutes, still could not get the problem resolved! Very very frustrated. Will never buy this again!"
3,Not bad for a freebie,"I got this as a freebie, and it was my first Apple ""i"" product.Plusses+ compact design fits in pocket+ color display is bright and sharp+ metal case is sturdy and durableMinuses- low storage = few songs- somewhat heavy, due to all-metal caseFYI~ The click wheel is kinda cute, though one of the buttons is sticky, so the touch & feel isn't awesome.~ Rockbox was loaded, making it easy to work with for simple ""drag & drop"".Overall= OK media toy, but definitely not something I would have paid much money for."
2,old revision,I was disappointed in this purchase because it was obsolete before it arrived. I ordered it to give as a gift but was unable to do so because it was out of date. The price was close to retail so I was unaware of this situation. It sits in my closet now with no real value.
4,Love It,"For the money this is a great deal. I absolutely love it. After I bought it I wished I had gotten one with video capability, but this is a quality product. I also wish there was some way to attach a lanyard without using a case but haven't figured that out yet."
3,Apple and Microsoft,"I had mine for about 2 months then i went running with it, then all of a sudden it went ""hay wire"" showing an unhappy face. When i tried to restore it it showed up a ""1418 error"" saying it couldn't perform the function. So I had to send home to my brother in California so he can take to an Apple store because they don't have an iPod store in Aomori, Japan. I would much rather send it back to Apple so they can replace it, but whatever...The cool part is the support but on the other hand you think they would make these things a little bit more tougher so someone who actually works out can use'em...Or Maybe i just pushed to hard...All and all this hasn't turned me off from Apple it just boiled my blood a little bit, that's all."
3,Nano,Product was brand new. It took forever to be shipped and received. With as much money as you pay for shipping you would think it would arrive faster. Overall I'm happy with the product.
1,poor quality,"the ipod i bought literally doesnt work. if you press skip it continues to shuffle non stop. Very dissatsified with this ""refurbished"" product. Will not buy another refurbushid product"
1,No Sound,"Just moved up from mini-ipod to the Nano. I could be unhappier. Once I stop listening and plug it in, I have to reboot it each time to get sound. I have no sound otherwise. This completely does not work for me since I use it at the gym with audiobooks. So now I am using the wheel to fast forward...at 20 second intervals which is not how it is supposed to be either...my mini jumped forward in much larger intervals so can only think this feature is not working on the Nano correctly either. Completely frustrated but I'll trade it for another. Apple gets one more chance and then I'm moving to another mp3 player."
1,They don't work,I've had two ipods. A mini and a 20 gb. The mini quit working less than a year after I purchased it. The 20 gb won't hold a charge for a minute. I was meticulous about keeping them out of hot cars. Itune songs won't play on other players without a major hassle. Now I've got a bunch of itunes purchased songs that I'll have to rerip as mp3's if I want to try another brand player. What a pain.
3,Ipod Nano,"I went from a Shuffle to a Nano for the flexibility of being able to visually scan through my music and for the gig size. Learning to adjust the volume has been a real hassle for me, the Shuffle was much easier to adjust and to keep in the desired setting.I'm hoping that once I get the hang of using the dial that it will all be easier but there seems to be a steep learning curve and a lack of responsiveness in the unit itself."
4,New to the ipod world...,"I bought the ipod a few months back~~and while I do like to think that I tech-savy, I struggled with this! The non-existent directions that came with it were of no help, but I have enough friends that have them, that they were able to walk me thru it.Very lightweight...nice sound....just wish there were better directions with it."
1,disposable mp3's,Our family has had 4 Ipods in the last 2 years only one of them still works. they are not reliable.
3,Is Good for the car,"I buy this device to use it altogether with the wireless for FM, and is very good since you avoid to load with the CD in fit 2000 songs more or less 6 days of music for the car.I recommend it"
2,iPod nano mini-,"Apple's solution came in the form of the iPod nano, a mini-mini-version of their current iPod color line. That's right, it's more miniature than the iPod mini, and the display is color! It's clear that these two superior elements are the reasons why Apple decided to do away with the original iPod mini line; however many consumers are upset that the iPod nano's storage capacity is smaller than what the iPod mini used to be. At 2GB and 4GB, though, the capacities are higher than the current iPod shuffle line and the pricing falls right in line in between shuffles and regular color iPods.I made mistake buying to small iPod Nano 4GB, I wish it was bigger like 30GB."
5,Wonderful,"At 8G's it holds all the ""important"" music I need for when I go running or when doing work around the house. For me the important factor was small size. With an optional belt clip that I bought I can't even notice it when I run. Sound quality is better then any other music player I have had. With a little ""self instruction"" from the help menu, iTunes is extremely easy to use. All I had to do was drag my Windows Media Player folder into the iTunes library and all my music was converted. The only negative I have seen is the large amount of hard drive space used with both iTunes and Media Player music on one computer. Since everyone in our house is now using Pod's or Nano's we have deleted all of our Media Player files to free up space. If small size is important, this is the right product for you. If you absolutely have to take ""all"" of your music with you at all times get something bigger."
4,Great little IPOD,"I got this for Christmas, even though I had hoped for the bigger one, I am still very happy with it. I wish it held more songs, that is about the only complaint I have. It is the neatest thing to own if you love music. I've had fun buying accessories for it, but my wallet hasn't enjoyed it much! Get you one!"
5,A better iPod,"With moderate care in handling, the light weight Nano is a better iPod. The battery lasts longer than my conventional iPod, the sound is equally good, the Nano fits more easily in a breast pocket, and charges much faster than the hard disc Pods. All of the controls are the same. All in all, for me a more desirable unit."
1,Crappy!!,Only had the item one month and it already conked out. For the past few days when i hit play it just cycles thru the songs without playing. Then today it just cuts out on a full charge.
5,Ipod,I received my Ipod that works perfect and i received it far sooner than the expected date. A trustworthy seller!
5,Love it.,"I have had this Ipod Nano for over three years. I never had any problems with it dropped it a few times still works. It has a rich and sleek design . Feels nice and your hands and still a sexy little device.I thought about the other Ipods, but once you get this one you do not need another.I have over 1000 songs and its very easy to use.If I had to trade it in. I would trade it in for a touch."
1,poor quality,"I purchased the ipod and it had a 2 week return policy. Now after just after 3 weeks the ipod just randomly skips through the play list without playing any music!! This was for my 8 yr old son and now he cannot use it and we cannot return it either!!! When I purchased it online.... it said ""great guality"" and ""poor shape"" Total opposite!!!"
5,Small Size - Big Features,"For such a small mp3 player, it is certainly packed with alot of extra features - including games, calendar, address book, stop watch, alarm, world clock and more.With 2 GB of storage, you can store around 500 songs and alot of photos. You can even view your photos as a slideshow, complete with transitions. The click-wheel is intuitive and easy to use.Battery-life has been improved (up to 24-hour playback now) from the 1st Generation Nanos and there is a handy on-screen battery indicator.The all-aluminum body feels solid in your hand and does not get scratched easily."
4,"Very stylish, but headphones must be replaced","iPod Nano is sleek and cool, the menus are intuitive, the display bright and easy to read. However, beware: if you are serious about listening to your music, you will need to replace the supplied headphones as they are totally inadequate. I recommend Sennheiser PX 100 - the white version, obviously, to match your iPod."
5,iPod Nano 2GB,This was a great purchase. Everything was well packaged and worked beautifully. My 10 year old loves this and uses it a lot--when he can wrestle it away from his grandfather!
5,Great Buy!,"I had already bought two of these at Wal-Mart for $147.88 each plus tax thinking I had gotten the best price. My dad mentioned checking Amazon and I found these for $136 with no tax, no shipping. I saved $32 total. (Worth it to me!)The iPods work great. I bought one for my almost 8 year old daughter and my 10 year old son. They love them. The iPods are so small you can take them anywhere. You can also download their favorite CDs onto the iPod-you don't have to get all your songs by paying for them. Amazon even had some great iPod nano covers/protectors with my son's favorite NBA player and some pink bling for my daughter."
2,Second Hand.,"This was for a person to replace something they lost that didn't belong to them. Item came on time. It took longer than expected considering how close it was but still on time. Didn't notice any issues when first opened packaging & turned it on. After I handed device over I got nothing but complaints about it. Item advertised as excellent condition considering it was used. However, I was told after a short while of use it wouldn't stay on for more than 1/2 an hour or so & there were a few more scratches than expected. Don't know if it's the user or sellers fault but no one asked about returning it. So I can't be sure about it being false advertisement or user error. Have not used device myself this is second hand only."
2,Easy to use but horrible battery life.,"Went bad after one year, with battery life slowly draining. After a year, just quit, demanding hard resets and would not wake back up. This happened (of course) just after the warranty ran out."
1,dont buy an apple ipod,"bought this item in march of 2006. love the slim design, music sounded great and functionality was great! 2 months after purchase it broke...had it replaced promptly (great customer service) free of charge. i stopped using it after this time, picket it up back up again in december of 2006. it broke...AGAIN... this time the warranty had run out and i purchased an extended warranty on it ($40!!!!!!) and they replaced it again.3 months later...it has broken...again! and they cannot find my extended warranty. this is not user error because everytime it broke i received a different error and a different reason for why it stopped working. i am wondering if they just keep giving me refurbished nanos or something.i am never going to buy an ipod for myself or for anyone else ever again!"
3,All the hype?,It is nice and will serve it's purpose. I didn't care for the lack of instructions and lack of included accessories. Like there is no docking station. Just a wire.
4,*****Excellent,"Excellent MP3 player by Apple, Thin and very easy to use buttons. I bought it for my son and he loves it. The itunes software allows you to copy the CD into your library the moment you load it. However I found it difficult to copy songs into IPOD from CD. The software is very confusing. You have to first load the songs into library and then into IPOD. THere is no direct way. Sometimes the software would hang when synching songs. Also I could not figure out how to easily load pictures on IPOD. It would be a great product if Apple can add FM radio in it. With a wide range of accessories available and the price rolling back It is a obvious choice over other MP3 players"
1,That's why I hate apple,"Never seen a worse, less intuitive, inconvenient to use and worsely documented software that iTunes. Apples is up to it's usual standard. That's precisely why I prefer not to mess with it."
4,Just fascinating over and over again,"Every time I look at the little black nano I am surprised about its size, its feel and its capabilities...the menus work well, the wheel responds fast (er than my 30 GB iPOd photo) and updating it via USB isnt as much of a pain inthe brain as I initially feared it might be...downsides are:its either PC or Mac compatibility , NOT both...(and I thought i could use it as a convenient way to transfer files)and....its princesslike behavior towards anything that touches it...the little jeanpocket Steve put it in? hm. nothing in it...but it has scratches when i took it out...a cloth to polish sunglasses (the high quality super-technical stuff that comes with Ray Bans)..scratches it too...But this lead to the development of our nano leather sleeves...so bad things have a good outcome sometimes, you can find it by searching for a ""nano sleeve"" here on amazon.Buy a nano, be happy and remember: WRAP WHAT YOU LOVE!"
4,iPod rocks,"iPod rocks and once again Apple shows why it's worth spending the extra bucks on a quality product.Pros: sleek design, small, easy to use.Cons: you can only use iTunes to ""work"" on the device.Absolutely recommendable."
5,iPod Nano,"This is a great product, probably the best mP3 for $150. The backlit screen is much brighter, the battery life is longer and it is extremely light. The sound quality is very good and unless you have jumbo-sized hands, it is the perfect size.It does have games that you can play while you listen, it has and adress book and a calender that can bee synced with iTunes.The only flaw that I have found so far is you have to charge the battery on the computer by plugging it in there. So, when you plug it in, it tries to sync with iTunes as well and is a pain in the neck.I would suggest this product for everyone because it does a little something for people of all ages."
2,A great looking product that even works sometimes!,"Okay, the thing looks great and feels tinier than the previous generation of Nano and that's a good thing. There is roughly 7.5gb free space for storage and that's a good thing.However! Buyer beware, because I have found one important negative detail, which is one serious glitch:Approximately 1 in 3 of the mp3 file's I uploaded to the 8gb Nano won't play. Instead the screen turns black with a white Apple logo displayed for approximately 5-6 seconds, then the screen goes off completely for a moment, then reboots to the black screen with the Apple logo for a few seconds then displays the main menu. Sometimes the root folder of the mp3 file that didn't work is removed from the directory tree.I haven't found anything online about this glitch--as far as a firmware update or if this problem is widespread. As much as I love it and want to keep it, I will probably be returning this iPod and waiting for a more stable version to be released.:'("
5,Excellent,I just received the nano for my birthday. It is perfect.To Mark Heyrman- I had no problems at all installing it on my Dell desktop. It took a total of 2 minutes. You must be a complete moron not to be able to use this thing. The reason it doesnt have a detailed manual is because it is simple to use.
4,very convenient,i chose to buy the 8GB nano instead of a 30GB video because I use my iPod strictly for music and have no need for video capability but even more than that was because my previous iPod stopped working due to hard drive failure and the nano uses flash memory. considering that i run and work out i think i made the right choice. no 5 star simply because i haven't owned it long enough and i would have liked to have paid less or get a little more memory since my music collection is larger that the available space.
3,Needs to hold more songs and how do you put photos on it!,"The ipod nano is OK but is not great it can hold some more song and is a huge pain to put photos on it because the camera adapter does not work with the ipod nano.If you want to get an ipod nano get the new one which can hold up to 500 songs,1,000 songsor 2,000 songs and comes in 6 colors and the colors are Blue,Pink,Black,Green,Silver and Red.(Red is only sold on [...]). Thanks"
2,I am disappointed with,"I know iPods are supposed to be the best. But, I think they just rip you off. Sure, you get some games, it's thin and slick. My sis got a CREATIVE ZEN 5 gigs for less money. Like a $[...] less. Her ZEN can play more songs, has a built in radio, and you can put a background on it. The iPods ""is the best"" beacause of the brand ""apple"". Sure, your friends may laugh at you because your ""unapple"" is fat or small. They won't laugh at you when you show what it can do. Trust me. You can find something much better and less expansive. I am mad at myself for getting this iPod. (it has a bad manual too)"
1,too thin!,i never actually purchased this product but i have numerous friends who have. yes it is thinner than a pencil and i can see the highlights of something being thin however ipod nano goes too far.all of my friends that have put other types of ipods have been able to put them in their pockets without problems but my friends who have got ipod nanos have put them in their pockets and after a couple of times doing so it was so thin that they snapped in their pockets (apple couldn't give them refunds). i suggest the ipod mini because it is virtually the same size but thicker so they wont snap.
3,Poor transfer speed :-(,"I've received 2GB iPod nano today.I tried to upload 290 songs to my iPod nano using iTunes 5 in Windows environment. It took more than twenty five minutes to sync all songs. I don't know why. I used latest notebook from Samsung (same as Dell's ODM model). Also browsing speed is some kind of bulky. I'd like to use Firewire to transfer songs, but iPod nano doesn't support Firewire data transfer. I've read other reviews that transfer speed is far more better than mine. What's wrong with my iPod nano? :-("
4,I wanted more from my ipod!!!,"I always wanted a MP3 player, and I always wanted an IPOD. When I finally got one I had to buy so many other things (universal dock, power adapter, etc) that the final cost were extremelly high.The manual is so cheap.Next time I will buy a MP3 with voice recorder and radio."
2,This is a real cutie - - when it works!,"It is definitely temperamental, and I have had to talk to Apple tech support a number of times. . . for various problems, such as freezing up and not responding at all, for instance. When that happens you have to let the battery run out completely, which means you have to re-download everything that was on it when you power up again!! This has happened twice in the less than six months I have had my iPod.I don't know if there is an MP3 device that is better - if there is I would love to know about it."
4,NANO rocks.,"Great battery life, easy to use, all around good. The only minus is the dependency on ITunes."
3,Ok does it really meet the ipod mini?,a lot of people in the reviews were comparing this with the ipod mini. im sorry you cant compare the 2 i dont have this ipod and i dont want it because frankly these things are getting to be out of control. the ipod mini was the perfect size even though they are thicker than the nano you would know it is there and you wouldnt break it by accident( a lot of people i know did)and also i hear about the other ipod nanos that they stop working after a while. and making these things even thinner was stupid considering that the other ipod nanos were too thin in the first place. Why couldnt they just make a ipod mini with a color screen?
5,Enjoying the music,I had a great experience ordering my new Apple 4 GB Nano Ipod. I found it was about $30 less expensive than getting it from the Apple site or from a store near me. I had it within a week (worth it for the savings)and was able to use my Amazon credit card savings certificate.
5,IPOD,"This ipod was better than expected, it was recognized by my computers, with no problems.Looks better than my old one. The seller's were very helpful and answered all myquestions."
3,white screen of death,The head phones jack on the bottom is great when you have a carrying case with a lanyard. My ipod nano now has the white screen of death and apple wants nearly the price i paid for it to fix it. Before i buy another ipod i'll check out the Microsoft Zune.
4,iPod Nano,"I bought this for my 11 year-old daughter.She loves it! Besides the cool color, it seems easy enough to use for her age group. She needed a little help from her older brother to download the songs, but I'm sure she will be doing it on her own very soon."
3,Bad Condition,"Arrived on time and looked okay. Item eventually will allow you to choose music visually. Not it does not work at all. I did purchase it used and they said it might have an issue, but it lasted a couple years.I would still recommend the seller because they did say there were issues with it. I just could not avoid the cheap price."
3,"Nice replacement, but obviously older model","This item is exactly as I expected. However, it has been nearly a year since my original pink Apple iPod nano 4 GB was stolen, and my expectations for what I was getting had been changed by seeing all of the updates and gadgets now available. I am completely okay with my purchase and it was truly an exact replacement of my solen iPod, but someone who is going to purchase the same model should consider how old it truly is."
2,Get a Zen instead,"I bought my son a Creative Labs Zen 30GB (under $200) and my daughter the Nano ($149, it's what she wanted). When the two arrived, she regretted her choice. I regret it even more. I can buy and download music from almost anywhere for the Zen - no problem. The Nano is a dog. The less expensive music sites (e.g., Walmart) don't offer iPod-format tunes. Converting them is a bear and waste of time. Apple has ripped customers off for 20 years. I remember the ""IBM-Big Brother"" SuperBowl ad way back when. Turns out Apple is Big Brother. Incompatibilities among its own products. Doesn't play nice with other hardware and software. Locks customers into proprietary formats. Fixes prices (ever see an iPod discounted?). Can't wait for the Feds to investigate - one of these days. I wish I'd bought two Zens -- there's a great product. Don't waste your $$ on a proprietary system like iPod, no matter how ""hip"" it is."
4,so close but no cigar,AWESOME ipod i got the black one for my birthday i can fit all my metal on it plus all thee other crap in my library. and fotos and Pit ov Humanity (novel i am writing) although the notes can only be so long. i would have given it 5 but the battery life is about half ov what it is billed for.0h i have a jokea woman is driving down the reno highway she sees a native american woman with her three kids walking up the shoulder. she asks if the woman wants a ride. they get in and the indian woman asks what the chocolates she sees on the floor are for and the driver says they are for her husband and the indian says good trade.if u thought this was funny then say it was helpfull.
1,"maybe if I could use it, my rating would be higher","This is a beautiful product. But, if you're like me and have next to no computer savvy, be wary: iTunes 7 can be excruciatingly slow. I put in a CD more than a day ago to import to iTunes, and it is still not done. I have no idea what to do. The iPod, which I named Lulu, was plugged into my computer for the first time yesterday, and ever since has been sporting the ""do not disconnect"" screen. I have found no support phone numbers to call. If/when I figure out how to use this very pretty piece of technology, I may update my review. But as of now, I am hundreds of dollars poorer and have nothing to show for but red-faced frustration."
2,More $$ 4 so much less!!!,"Well the ipod nano is sooooo much money and doesnt even have that many features.Compare it to a sensa.Its about the same size.Thats the only thing they have in common.The sensa is like a ipod nano and video ipod combined !!And the sensa has voice recording,and you can even watch videos u created !!The only other difference is the look. Thats all a nano is good for ,the LOOK.And who sees ur mp3 player anyways,right??You can get an 8 gb sensa with all these feuters for the price of a 4 gb nano!!as the old saying goes,you do the math!!(or commen sense!)"
2,its not that good,i gotta admit it doesnt get scratched and has more battery power but thats it. the thing makes me disapointed is that they seperated the color. i like black but i have to buy a 8gb for it to be black. that sucks.
4,"Good product, but it isn't perfect","The iPod Nano is the perfect MP3 combination of looks, charm and functionality, but it lacks real durability. Don't get me wrong, I think this thing is pretty amazing--its size, its screen, etc. My complaints come in the fact its LCD screen scratches EXTREMELY easily. I mean, you'd think Apple would've developed a less scratchable screen by now, right? The TouchWheel is an amazing invention, but sometimes it is so sensitive it becomes hard to navigate through the menu (the slighest quiver in your finger could move the highlighted bar someplace else in an instant). It's a good product, definitely, but it ain't perfect."
1,TERRIBLE ATTITUDE OF SELLER!!!!,"I actually placed an order for this item, I heard nothing from the seller to confirm the order. I emailed 2 times and than replied to an email I received from Amazon letting me know the order was not confirmed before I got a response from the seller that stated my emails had gone into junk mail. The seller said they could still send it out but I said please just cancel the order. I did not receive a response stating that the order was canceled so I sent another email to the seller saying ""Please verify that the order has been canceled. Thank you!"" and the response I received was in the sellers exact words ""stop emailing me it's done"" This is terrible service and a terrible attitude. If I were you I would never order anything from this seller. EVER!!!"
3,Ipod Question.,"I have not own a ipod nano yet so everyone can pretty much ignore my 3 stars.here is my first question: Does Ipod Nano work with Window media player? I have over 2000 song on my computer and if somy second question is if it work you i be able to see the ablum art and everything else display on the nano as if i was getting music from itune.If both answer are yes, than i will definitly buy an ipod nano.Thank all for helping me."
3,NANO GOOD GONE BAD!!!!! TAKE A LOOK!!,the ipod is good for sk8ing. and is good if you do not plan on using alot of songs. they also scratch very easy. you have to get a case for it.but very good for every day uses. i have not hade any probloms with it yet......But ipod video is way better and i an saving for one. i an 13 and it's good for a kid. it is very easy to set up.head phones blow out easy!!!!! very expencive!!! my oppion is try one for your self!!@
5,Perfect,"Great iPod. I hve several versions (mini, shuffle and video) and this is the best. The battery keeps charge a lot of time (I listen music in my car about 1 week)and the screen is very good."
4,I love my iPod Nana...if you love music it offers plenty of room for all you fav tunes,"I love my basic black Nano. 8Gigs is plenty. I have about 300 songs on there now and have used about 1/6th of my space!!!! If you are a music lover, it offers plenty of room for more than enough music!!!! So far I have not had any problems."
2,"Earphones and Jammed Buttons, Apple should be sewed!!",I can't believe how annoying this ipod is getting. I have had it for about 4 months now and the earphones have gone dead. The battery life is also decreasing rapidly. The buttons are also getting jammed. If I were you I would go for something else.
5,ipod 8 gig,Ipod is a great success. was a little shaky bout buyin a ipod online but it had no scratches and works great
2,Cord does not charge IPOD and Lock Switch Broken,"The USB cord that came with the IPOD does not work and will not charge the IPOD. I had to use a friends cord to charge it and will have to buy another one on my own. Also, the lock button (switch) at top of IPOD does not work, you have to shift it back and forth multiple times before the IPOD becomes locked.Other then those two pretty big things the IPOD works good."
1,My order never shipped! Still waiting for refund!,"Not only have I still not gotten this product, I am still waiting on Amazon to refund my money!!! I bought this 5 weeks ago. Now I have lost over an entire month of decent workouts because I don't have music. DO NOT BUY FROM SAMWISE! The little jerk told me ""to not worry"" he would send it when he returned from business trip."
5,Ipod Convert,"Got tired of my quirky MP3/CD player and decided to give the iPod a shot. I always thought people were overpaying for these, considering there are plenty of other less expensive mp3 players that do the same thing. Boy was I wrong. The interface (wheel) on this thing is great, quality of the music is great, iTunes is OK, and allows you to import your own MP3s. If you plan on using an mp3 player more than a few hours a week, then I'd recommend getting an iPod for ease of use and numerous available accessories."
4,My wife is happy,"I bought the Ipod as a gift to my wife and she is happy, the device is light and easy to wear when you are running, perfect for sports given the size and weight, the only thing that I didn't like is that the manuals don't respond many questions that you can have when is your fist time using and Ipod."
5,FABulous!,"Fast shipping....Love the item. Plenty of space; holds charge for a long time! Small, sleek and very sophisticated...with a very sassy pink edge!"
4,"Pretty Good, But Should be Built Better","Amazon sent a Nano Ipod that had a weak and loose lower rim casing, which is where the charger goes; it appears to almost be falling off, and this is at brand new condition?"
4,Nicely rounded contraption,"Yessir, this is a good music player; one of the best, I'd wager. It's really easy to use - those of you who don't know a gigabyte from a megahertz will have no trouble using an iPod nano. It's sleek and stylish. The only problem I've had is that it randomly turned on because something was pressing against the buttons; thus causing the batteries to eventually run out."
4,2gb nano,After having an initial problem with FedEx-not the sellers fault-product arrived as stated and works without problem-it is reconditioned which explains the crazy low price(got it for the same price as a new shuffle would cost)
4,almost great,"The ipod is great...love all the features. It does more than I realized, but the earphones lasted all of three weeks! The left one blew out quickly and I'm a 40ish year old who doesn't play it nearly as loud as younger users are sometimes known to do. Several other aquaintences have confirmed the same problem with theirs. I will say...the sound was GREAT while it lasted."
5,Nano Review,"This may be the best gift I've purchased for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. I thought she'd get tired of it a few weeks after Christmas like she has done her other toys in the past but I can't get my hands on it.The times I have been allowed to use it, I'm so impressed. The features and the sound clarity is remarkable. WE LOVE IT!"
1,Poor customer service,"The features of the iPod are phenomenal. Unfortunately, the service offered by Apple is sub-par. Beyond 90 days, your only option is to submit a request on Apple's website (Apple only permits one free support call within the 90 day window). A service request I submitted was cancelled with no reason given and no method to respond.Beyond the 1 year warranty, expect to buy a new mp3 player rather than have your existing iPod serviced. To have a battery replaced, the service charge is $70, with an additional $30 in shipping. For all other issues, your iPod will be replaced for $170, with an assitional $30 in shipping. That's more expensive than the 2GB Nano that's on the market!Utterly ridiculous, and not what I have come to expect from Apple's reputation. Needless to say, my next purchase will be from one of Apple's competitors."
1,BAD DESIGN,"This IPOD is just not worth it. After trading in my older IPOD for the nano, I was shocked at how scratched this one gets. Then, after putting it in my pocket--as advertised--the screen cracked under very, very little pressure. This is a design flaw that is becoming well known and will lead to this product's demise."
4,Nice!,Pros:Fits into a coin pocket of a ladies pair of jeansgood soundit's smalllooks goodI can dance with it in my pocket and not worry about itcons:scratches easilywith case it does not fit well into pocketI would defanitly recomend it but invest in a case and a screen cover to protact it from scratching
1,Crappy,Pros: It's pretty...Cons: It freezes... A LOT !!! An article on cnn where sony confesses that the nano's have a problem....Amazon is always great though....
2,Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (2nd Generation),"Getting started was a little difficult, but I finally managed to start downloading music and podcasts.I was very disappointed that I cannot download eAudio books from Net Library because Apple does not offer the kind of copyright protection that libraries require. The library told me that they had repeatedfly tried to negotiate these features with Apple, but had no success.The biggest disappointment, however, was that contrary to the iPod advertisements, you cannot sync calendars from Outlook. Outlook Contacts can be synced, but not calendars. I managed to find a support number at Apple, and they told me that although their manual gives very specific directions about how to sync Outlook Calendars, they do not support this feature....so, basically, you can't do it, and they don't care if the advertisements and the manual lie."
4,IPOD Nano,Product was shipped in a timely manner and arrived as promised. Product was as advertised and worked properly.
4,the ipod nano a mp3 player thats good,"ok my friend came over and brought his nano over and it took us 3 hrs. to download at least one song now some peole might say wow because it took us so long but we r 12. and then we had to figure out how to get it ON the ipod. dang that took so long until we got 5 songs on. Be prepare for long hrs. of frustation and plenty of tears.Ofcourse, after that it was real easy to download music."
4,ipod rocks but....,the itunes doesnt i no its suppoesed to be easy to use but it wont download songs. oh well we'll get it to work soon(i think today) teh ipod ano rocks i no its suppoesed to scrach easy but it doesnt. and ive hadr start had mine for 2 days now and barly any fingerprints are able to see. why four stars because of itunes not working
1,i pod 4gb,"Very good product, unbelieveable what that thing can do and information it can hold. Beware of the ""i-tunes"" website, unless you're sporting a big wallet!"
1,Most fragile piece of consumer electronics I've ever seen,"Amazing functionality and beautful design doesn't last long. Within one week the ipod is so scratched that you'll think you're keeping razorblades in your pocket. The battery stopped holding its charge after 6 months. Spoke to an apple agent they told me send it back we'll repair it no problem. Just pay the $30 for shipping. My repair was declined. If you have ipod problems good luck dealing with apple's customer service.So small you can take it anywhere. Just make sure you don't put it in your pocket, or car, or anywhere else it could touch something."
4,A Great Introduction to iPod,"The 4GB Nano is perfect for those starting out in the iPod world. It has enough space and enough features to satisfy the ""listen-at-work-and-while-commuting"" crowd. It is also great while working out on a treadmill or elliptical exercise machine (with the optional armband holder). Buy a car adapter for commuting and play it through your car FM. The silver Nano is much more attractive for the adult crowd. After about a month, you're going to want to move up to the 30 or 80GB models just because video is so much neater.The only real downside is that the earbuds are terrible. They slip, slide, and otherwise have a tendency to remove themselves from most human ears. Buy a good set of small folding headphones."
4,Excelent!!,"Excelent package, the black box, neatly sealed, you just cant wait to open it, but at the same time not wanting to wreck the box.Excelent sound, you can even install a linux distro and be able to view videos.Pros:Linux CapableSound QualitySIZEScreenConsScratches easilyFixed EQ, can't change any of themShould have gotten white, scratches show less.No video capable unless you go to ipodlinuxFor the price, you cant go wrong. Between the 1gb and the 2gb for the difference get the 2gb nano version."
5,Wow! You're here!,"Amazing! So you're saying that you actually searched for Chum, and linked to this page? That's far more than 99% of human population ever did for these boys. I do like Chum. And you should too. They're a metal band that is fairly easy on the ears, and draws me into a numb sort of zen state. While the real audio clips of this album sound terrible, you have to listen to an entire Chum song to get the real feeling of it. Dead to the world is nearly impossible to find, and it's a cr*p-shoot as to whether or not Amazon will have it in stock at any given moment. But Chum would really appreciate it if you bought their little album. Thank you!"
4,Awesome solo debut,"At first i was a little scared to buy this, because next was never one of my favourite groups, but i was so happy i did. This is the first cd in the past three months from a solo male artist that i REALLY can listen to all the tunes non-stop. The song ""Got me a model"" is a club banger. I am totally in love with ""Good man"", it is such a beautiful love song. However i am also feeling the two step song, Damn, and the song with Snoop and Kim"" Do you wanna roll"". Rl sweetie, after that awesome cd , i will roll with you anytime. Great job , you have definitely proven yourself, Usher better watch out."
1,Give me more!,"Man I have been waiting for something from this cat since NEXT'S ""Butta Luv"". I loved that jam. Well he finally dropped his solo project...!!!! The only tack I really like on this CD is Track 10, ""Luv led Me to You"". Everything else is mediocre at best Shaheed The Poster Boy from BET ""106 @ Park's"" Friday Hip Hop Battle makes an appearance(I'm glad he's getting some luv, he can flow) but the song, Track 4.... Track 5, ""Good Man"", kinda reminds you of ""These are the Times"" by Dru Hill. It doesn't come close to the greatness of that song though. Tracks 8 and 12 had potential, just not executed. Listening to this CD was like watching the Trailblazers play basketball. A lot of potential and hype but just erratic. This CD surprised me because RL is now a member of J Records, arguably the tightest record label out there right now. I guess when you have Alicia Keys, Angie Stone, Luther Vandross, O Town, Busta Rhymes and Erick Serman on you roster somebody has to [be last]"
4,Anything by James Carroll is good,"Began reading and then got side tracked on to something else. Ever since he wrote ""Constantine's Sword"" I have been an avid reader of his works."
2,Not for me.,I was so let down by the scent! ITs pungent to say the least but does not make my nose do cart wheels at all. At first it smells like Tigress perfume (back in the day-remember?) but then it gets weird on me. Maybe its just my skin but I don't care for this but absolutly LOVE LOVE LOVE White Diamonds and Diamonds and Sahphires to piecies! This one bombed as far as Im concerned with the scent. I don't care for Diamonds and Emeralds either because of the strong gardina in it. EWWWWW..........im not a gardina fan in the least.
5,Diamonds are a girl's best friend.,I had tried Diamonds and Sapphires and like it so well I wanted to try the Diamonds and Rubies. I've actually found out that I like the Diamonds and Rubies better. The fragrance lasts all day without being overpowering.
1,It reads and informs like a javadoc listing,"I was so excited to see a Java book on DSP. I was terribly disappointed with this book however. Firstly, it uses Java 1.0.x, not Java 1.1.x. This startled me since the book was published in 1998. The 4 chapter 'intro to java' programming tutorial is pointless since anyone pursuing a topic as advanced as DSP should know the language they are going to work in! The rest of the book reads like Javadoc output interspersed with comments from the author. I really wanted to love this book but ultimately I've grown to hate it."
5,Middle school required reading,A wonderful blend of viewpoints---his and hers--which drives home the point--nothing is ever what it seems. There are some great messages for middles schoolers as they navigate the tumultuous road through adolescence.
4,A great breezy book,"This book gave just the right humor to keep it moving. The lessons it shoves at you, gives you the chance to view life in a slightly different way. Not only was this book great on morals. But it showed just how interesting it is to see all sides of the story! This is a great read, if you want something you can finish in a day!"
3,Flipped- for someone around age twelve,"I would recommend this book for a younger audience. I myself am sixteen, and I became rather bored with it. However, I think a younger person, most likely a girl, would really enjoy it. Throughout the book there is a message to ""just be yourself"", which is very important. However, I found some parts confusing, as the characters' point-of-view changes from chapter to chapter. This was not a bad read, but I prefer things with a little more context, and something that catches my attention a little better. I hope my review has been helpful!"
3,A great truth about love,"This is a darling story of how first love in those awkward teenager years can work. It's sweet, snappily-if-not-eloquently written, and really manages to get inside the heads of its two characters. That's probably the best thing about it--this is a book that cares passionately about its characters, and that can be rare to see. I enjoyed the switching perspectives, and the li'l misadventures of the kids were fun and adorable. Insightful and clever."
3,Mae Mae's Book Review,"Bryce moved into Juli's neighborhood and Juli had a huge crush on him. She would never leave him alone. Bryce would say he was so annoyed with her until the day she stopped he couldnt stop thinking of her. But he wouldn't tell anyone because he thought that would ruin his reputation. Then one day Bryce and his friend were talking bad about Juli and how trashy her yard is. She over heard them and she defintitely didn't like him. He found out that she heard him so he felt real bad. He felt even more bad when she started cleaning up her yard a lot, and his grandfather helped her. Juli and his grandfather started to grow a better relation ship then Bryce and his grandpa."
4,Heartfelt & Sincere...,"This is really quite a wonderful book. Though simple in some ways, the story line tugs at the heartstrings and reminds us all of the struggles we face as we grow up. A good book for young men and women alike, each will find the story interesting."
5,"Why you should read the book ""Flipped""","The setting of ""Flipped"" takes place in a modern day era. The theme is communication and friendship. A young boy named Bryce and a girl named Juli are both the protaganist and the antagonist because they each switch roles throughout the story. Flipped is about a girl and a boy who don't get along so well. Bryce Loski doesn't like Juli one single bit; she is a total pain! Juli thinks Bryce is just perfect! When you read this book, you will discover the pros and cons of their relationship. It is told in first person narrative by both characters. -Reveiwed by Dana"
5,Wow!,"I really liked this book! Infact, I finished it in a day. Sometimes it would get sad, but I loved it just the same because it was a sweet story. I think everyone should read this book!!"
4,IF YOU LIKE LOVE STORIES YOU'LL LOVE THIS ONE!!!,"I just got done reading ""Flipped"". In this book two kids are enemies and some thing happens to them. if you want to find out what happens you need to read this book. if you like mixed up stories you'll like this one. In this book it started at a chapter about Bryce and his point of view about his new neighborhood. The second chapter is about Julie and her point of view. and they just keep swiching point of vies throught the vhapters."
5,What a Great Book!!!,"When I first started reading this book I couldn't put it down! My best friend had told me about ""Flipped"" and I loved it! Please go buy it right now! I promise that you will enjoy this book a lot just like I did! Enjoy :0)"
5,This book was the best. A must read.,"I first read this book when I was assigned to read in for my class. It was so good that I just HAD to read ahead. ""Flipped"" discusses what it is like to have your perspective of someone/something change. In the first half of the book, Juli likes Bryce, but Bryce thinks that Juli is an annoying pest. After a certian event, their perspectives of each other get totally flipped, and now Juli doesn't like Bryce, but Bryce thinks Juli is the best thing in the world.When I read this book I just couldn't stop reading it. It was written in a very good way (it is written from two perspectives), and I am glad the author decided to write it. First Bryce tells about what is going on, then in the next chapter Juli tells what is going on from HER perspective. One of the reasons I could relate to this book is that Juli has a Sycamore tree that she likes to climb, and I also have a Sycamore tree that I enjoy climbing.THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU ARE!!!"
4,Multi-layered and touching,"This book far surpasses most young adult books that encompass a romantic theme: the importance of looks/attraction is acknowledged but also put into perspective and the boy and the girl are both multidimensional, nuanced characters whose mistakes and triumphs keep you rooting for them.It was a very enjoyable read; light enough to be fun, but also thought-provoking."
3,Flipped?,"Flipped is an exciting book that shows there are two sides to every story. Flipped has two main characters: Juli and Bryce. Bryce moves to Juli's neighborhood, and she instantly falls in love with him. Bryce doesn't share the same feelings for Juli, and tries to avoid her at all costs. Follow two stories with different point of views; you will be amazed to see how much your feelings can flip!"
1,THE BEST BOOK EVER!,"""Flipped"" is the best book ever , it is a book about two different peoples point of views . There is a young boy, Bryce, and a young girl Juliana . If you read this book I know that you will love it .Especially if you like stories about people's feelings for each other that change constantly. So hurry up and buy this book before there are no more on the shelves! Luckily I already have one."
2,book not available,The dealer was quick to inform us that the book was damaged and could not be mailed. I appreciate the professionalism and courtesy.
4,A good Book,"The book flipped by Wendelin Van Draanen is a good book. There are two main characters in the book. One is Bryce. Bryce is a good looking kid with blue eyes that is still confused about life. Julianna is kind of annoying but very smart. She is very antagonizong, but digs deep into the beauty of life. The book is basically about Bryce and Julianna and how they see the world or whats going to in the world in their own point of view. They usually see things completly different from each other. The book takes place in around their homes, neijborhood, and school. I think the theme of this book is that ""there are two sides to everything."" i like the book because it was different and i liked how it went back and forth from each character. It was nice to see both sides of the situations."
5,Crazy with Style,"Flipped, your not so average book, is one manuscript that you should not judge by it's eccentric cover. The aforementioned novel is all about the relationship between Bryce Loskis and Julianna Baker, neighbors since the age of seven years old.As of the very first day he met Juli, Bryce thought she was a wild child, know it all. Since the very first day she met Bryce, Juli was infatuated with him and would do anything to stand out in his eyes. And so the volume goes on. While the book may seem drawn out, it is due to Draanen's willingness to show both Juli and Bryce's point of view on every event.I am sure that all who choose to read this book will find enjoyment and pleasure in doing so.Victoria"
5,Flipped,"I think this is a fantastic book because, Juli (one of the main characters) was raising chickens and I can relate to that. The reason I can is because I was raised on a farm. I also liked the book, because Juli liked Bryce and she was trying to get him to be her boyfriend. She liked him very much. Juli also thought that Bryce was walking around with her first kiss. She thought that because he had tried to kiss her and she backed away from him. In the middle of the book Bryce's mom had invited Juli's family over for dinner and Juli thought she was going to have a bad time but she didn't. She had a great time with Bryce at the dinner."
5,Great for all ages.,"My 12-year old daughter recommended this book to me as a ""quick read"". The back cover doesn't give it justice. There is a youthful love story, yes...but the adults in this book can learn a lot from the kids in it (adult readers can too). Do you really know people as well as you think you do? This book made me re-evaluate some of my friendships and what I was bringing to them. Juli is endearing and insightful. Bryce fumbles through like most of us do. Should be made into a film, in my opinion. A MUST READ!"
5,In my top five books of all time,"A perfect book. I've read it many times, starting in middle school (just graduated). It never fails to make me cry, and I'm not a big crier. Also, one of the most faithful movie adaptations of a book I've ever seen.Recommend to anyone and everyone :)"
5,FLIPPED,"Really awesome book. Kept me hanging on every word and great ending. I wish there would be a sequel, though"
4,Loved Flipped !,"I know this sounds corny, but all I have to say is : oh my gosh, Flipped is such a great book ! I loved it!"
2,flipped my life to deth,"I liked the book because of all the running away that Bryce does at the begining and that Bryce got 2 girls at the booster's luncheon. I also liked the flipped part because it makes Bryce look like a loser. I dis- like it because Juli liked him and then it flipped. Also I didn't like that the grandfather talks to the girl more than his own grandson. However, they end up getting closer."
5,Flipped,"The book I read about is called Flipped by:Wendelin Van Draanen. It is about a boy named Brice, and a girl named Julianna. First Brice moved into the neighborhood, and when Juli met him she FLIPPED. Juli had these chickens for a school science fair, they had been hatching eggs, so Juli thought she could give Brice some eggs. For two years straight Juli had brought Brice a 1/2 dozen eggsuntil one day she caught him throwing them away.Juli had this tree called the Sycamore tree, she loved that tree one day she was talking to it and told it that she was glad she still had it, but then one day some construction workers came and cut it down. Brices mom invited Juli's family over for dinner a few weeks after that happened, Brice and Juli didnt talk the whole time.At the end at the book Brice, and Juli were at this school lunch thing and everything flipped.....Brice tried to kiss Juli in front of everyone!!!!!!!!"
1,Good but way too predictable,Thsi book in my opinion was the same thing over and over. It was flirting than i knew they would turn out to like each other.
5,Great book...i think,I have not read flipped yet but i will be starting it soon in class. this makes me very excited an it should be great. i rated it one star because i dont know for sure what to expect from it. Hopefully this is a great book. The reviews make it seem like one. i havent read the book but i am looking at the reviews this book is supposed to be very good! If u are reading the reviews right now u should definitly read this book.
4,Two eighth graders with totaly diferent perspectives,"When Bryce moved in she flipped when he saw Juli he ran, this is how the tale on perspectives begins. Juli loves her family, is interested in trees and has a backyard of chickens, plus can not wait for her first kiss from Bryce. Bryce can't stand her and hides when she comes to him all till the eigth grade when the minds flip.This is a spectacular piece which will make you want to keep on going."
5,A great read,Author Wendelin van Draanen does an awesome job with this romantic comedy. Eighth grade characters Juli Baker and Bryce Loski go head to head in this novel that has the ability to give you both sides of the story. This book is great since it connects with both younger and older teens. It has the ability to give you that feeling of being in middle school again and having that ultimate first crush that you could never forget as well as that first kiss you had always dreamed of. I highly recommend this novel for anyone who has ever had a first crush that they just couldn't understand even as they got older.
3,Book Review for Flipped,"I think this book was OK. I rate it 3 stars. This book was about a boy named Bryce and a girl named Juli. First Juli is liking Bryce and Bryce is avoiding her. Then, some things were overheard by Julie. Thinks soon flip. His friend Garrett just makes it worse for Bryce. I thought this book was ok because some parts were boring and sometimes it was interesting and you wanted to find out what happens next. I think you should read it if you like books with two perspectives. The book gives you two people's ideas on one thing.B. W."
3,Flipped,"By:RayThe silliest book ever is flipped. This book is about a boy and a girl, at first the boy Brice moves in and then Julie (the girl) comes over from across the street and fellows Brice and gets in a fight with her and gets caught by his mother holding his hand and on it goes until 8th grad and on the way Julie does a since project with bobby chicks and they make all sourest of problems. But over all it was a good book and I give it a 3"
4,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,"I really enjoyed this book. Exciting things were always happening and I was constantly on the edge of my seat. The author did a fantastic job of developing the characters. It felt like they were real. I felt that I could really relate to the characters in the book. This book touched me in a way that is unexplanitory. The best way I can explain the message I got from this book is that even if something or someone you really want doesnt want you back, dont give up on life. GO on living as happy and to the fullest potential that you can. Who knows....one day that special someone my want you back....."
5,GREAT!,"I am a 7th grade student and I am in a book club. This was the book to read for the month of November-December. I started reading it and I fell in love. The detail added in the book is wonderful. It's an eye-catching book with a chickling on the plain white cover, up-side-down. What else would catch your attention and make you think, ""What's that supposed to do with the book?"" Obviously, something, and that something you shouldn't miss out on! It's a true ""non-putter-downer"". A book that you really have to keep going with. So much fun to read, and very entertaining. I HIGHLY recommend it!"
4,Good for its intended purpose.,"This book is written in a colloquial tone that may be off-putting to some, though amusing at first. It is a reasonably quick read; if your goal is to get a sense of the lay of TEE land and to get your feet wet, this book could serve that purpose. I think it would be difficult to pass the PTEeXAM based solely on this text.There is one section that this book hits out of the park -- hemodynamic calculations. Concise and easy to understand. Run through those a few times and you'll be able to nail any hemodynamic calculation question asked of you on the boards. Great demonstration of how to use PISA to calculate an EROA, etc.Summary: not detailed enough to serve as your primary text if you're taking the PTEeXAM. Reasonable introduction to TEE and concepts. Great treatment of hemodynamic calculations."
3,"Easily reading, but not enough","The author is humorous and it is easy to read. I talked to a physician who is an expert of TEE, and he said this book is not good. It didn't spend much time for you to read it one time completely. But it lack TEE picture, lack a lot of things about TEE can tell us, such as tissue doppler, deep transgastric view, ... etc. It is still a good choice if you want to know a little about TEE in the very short time."
2,not for a cardiologist,"it is a rather good book, but not for a cardiologist.. it seems to be written from an anaisthiologist to another anaisthiologist.Lot of fun also.Perhaps i should come closer to my anaisthiologist..."
1,Great album... but this reissue sounds terrible!,"Love the album, but the sound of this 1996 Scamp Records release is very poor. EQ is messed with to the point where the timing seems wrong, details get lost due to a lack of focus. It just doesn't ""groove"" at all. A friend who's also into audio agreed with me that this CD is an assult on the ears and just not ""musical"" sounding at all.I picked up the Licorice Soul release on vinyl from 2004 and it sounds MUCH, MUCH better. It sounds so different and so much more enjoyable than this CD it's hard to believe. There is also a brand new (2009) remaster out on CD that might sound better, but I haven't heard it. If you need a CD, I would try that reissue and leave this one alone.EDIT:I see this review is coming up for both reissues of Astro-Sounds. If you're looking at the 2009 26F Records release, you may be on the right track. If you're looking at the 1996 Scamp Records release, don't do it!... lol"
3,Elevator to the stars.,"101 Strings were know for their ""elevator music"" style instrumental albums. This album is something else entirely. The strings are still there, but they are pushed into the background. Instead, most of these tracks have rock guitars (heavy on the fuzztone) as the lead instruments. Lord knows what the little old ladies who were fans of 101 Strings thought when they heard this album. To my ears, it sounds like music from the soundtrack of an exploitation movie about hippies. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. The CD adds three bonus tracks from another offbeat album by 101 Strings, which featured ""erotic"" music. The most interesting of these tracks features the sound of a woman moaning while being whipped. This is a fun album that will appeal to people who like ""offbeat"" music."
1,"Never worked right, have to return it","I opened the package, pulled out the cord, and it retracted... and never stayed out. It always rolls right back in, which means I it's unuseable. When a product is this cheap, it's almost not worth returning, but I so resent buying something that never worked."
4,Good Knife but left a few things to be desired.,"I bought this knife as a survival knife in the woods. Being GI like I expected it to more or less function similar to the actual M-9. The Knife's is coated with a material to make it less shiny which is easy to scrape off during use. When I received this knife the blade was not as sharp as I would of liked. After about a 1/2 hour against a electronic sharpener this is now a very sharp knife. The scabbard does work after sharpening but may damage the knife if you attempt to cut too big of a wire. Overall I am happy with my purchase, but would of expected the finish to not scrape away so easily."
5,Most Original Hip Hop Fusion LP to Emerge in 10 Years,"What can't I say about this release? With all the drab releases that major labels thrust at us each year in the realm of hip hop, maybe 1 catches the ear each year. Well hey, this year it's 2 - Common's Like Water for Chocolate and now Hydroponic's Routine Insanity. This is a release that will stay in your CD changer for a long time to come. Take one part hip hop, one part jazz, one part Sweetback, one part Spooky, and an infinity of originality, and you'll catch what I'm trying to say. This release demands attention from people who know anything about music. Don't get caught sleeping on this. You'll be looking back wondering what those Hydroponic kids were doing back in 2000..."
2,Mediocre at best!,"YAAAAAWN! I had high hopes for this movie because I am a Ricci fan. But if it wasn't for her being in the film I would have turned it off. VERY boring! Christina, your next film? Be evil! Your good at it!"
2,"And really, 2 out of 5 ain't bad","Seeing this in the $7.50 rack at Wal-Mart, this movie is about what you'd expect. The idea itself is pretty interesting and the movie starts out with a little punch but then it settles into a sort of choppy mediocrity. It never really gets scary and it never completely makes sense. At least not to me. (Though, to be honest, I've never been accused of being the brightest bulb in the bunch.) Still, the actors are all competent and Christina Ricci, if you're a fan (And you should be.), is always worth watching. (And I'm assuming you're a fan of horror movies. Otherwise you wouldn't be reading this.) So all in all, not ""The Exorcist"" but better than shooting yourself in the foot.(And just as a side note, the picture? On the DVD? Where Christina Ricci is standing in the church staring at the camera? Never happens. And I just really really hate it when they do that.)Peace."
2,What a DUD!!!!!,The only thing that saves this movie a little bit is Christina Ricci. It is not the least bit of a horror film and definitely not scary. The story line is boring-the movie is boring and Ricci does not have to do much except walk around and look mystified. Avoid this one completely--I was not entertained by this one at all and you will not be either!!!!
5,The Gathering (C.Ricci),"I saw this movie a while ago...Because Christina Ricci is my favorite actress and idol. I knew it was gonna be interesting.I am really not religious at all and i couldnt stop staring at the tv at all...I don't understand why this movie wasnt released early . It would probably be more popular than now when all the ""PUNCH at the end"" thiller/horror movie started to be the new thing!!!I really didnt expect what happen in the end ... Maybe i was overexcited to see another Christina Ricci movie but i think you will be surprised.I would recommend this for people who liked THE OTHERS... it has the same atmosphere.Enjoy"
3,DEADLY RUBBERNECKERS,"The main thing going for THE GATHERING is its unique plot: the titular characters are rubberneckers from the crucifixion of Jesus who watched merely from morbid interest than any concern for the Christ. They have been cursed to wander the earth for all eternity to witness the atrocities of mankind: Kennedy's assassination, the Hiroshima bombing, etc.Christina Ricci stars aa a young backpacker on her way to a small English village, where she is hit by a distracted driver and recuperates in the driver's home. She starts thinking something evil is happening in the village and that the young boy she is staying with may be in some kind of danger.The movie is lethargic compared to modern standards, reflecting back to the psychological Hammer films of the 60s and 70s, but it maintains an undercurrent of evil. Ricci doesn't put a lot into her role, she seems uncomfortable at times. Ioan Gruffold fares better as her mysterious new friend.Not a classic horror film, but enjoyable."
5,Great horror movie,"This is a great movie. There is a really good plot. Also, the history behind the story is revealed at a decent pace. You don't have to wait until the last five minutes of the film for the build up."
4,Pretty Good Movie,"This movie was better than I had hoped for. The story is really good, and I was surprised by the ending. If you like Christina Ricci, you will feel for her character here. One thing that could have been better was the editing. It seems like some scenes were cut too quick and you are in the next scene too soon."
4,Something different for classic haunting/horror fans...,The Gathering is a different kind of horror movie. About the closest thing I could compare it to is Nicole Kidman's The Others. The story is somewhat similar. What kept me interested is the old church and the history behind its sculptures. While some might consider the story mediocre it's far better than a lot of movies that pass for horror nowadays. I love to sink my teeth into a good old English horror movie because they tend to stay true to more classic horror themes. Not everyone will think this is a good film. I thought it deserved 4 stars because it kept me entertained for 80 minutes and I found the story elements intriguing. Rent before you buy and make up your own mind.
5,Very good movie,Loved this movie. This is the first time in a while that I was not able to guess the ending right off the bat. Christina Ricci sure has grown up. Grown up in all the right places. She reminds me a lot of Summer Glau from The Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles.
5,The Best Limited Edition CD Available Today,Some of the heaviest sounds recorded in the nineties. Warrel Dane (ex-Sanctuary) is back and in full force! Includes a killer remake of Double Dare/Silent Hedges by goth legends Bauhaus. A must have for the serious metalhead!!
4,Essential EP,"Seattle-based metal act Nevermore followed up their self-titled 1995 debut album with the 5-song EP In Memory. In Memory finds the band continuing to develop their post-thrash, sort of doomy, sort of gothic, sort of power metal, but always dark style, which to this day remains almost impossible to categorize. The four studio tracks - Optimist or Pessimist, Matricide, Sorrowed Man, and the title track - are as good as anything you'd find onPolitics of Ecstasyor the band's debut, but the real highlight is the unexpected inclusion of a cover medley of Bauhaus's Silent Hedges and Double Dare. I love when bands come up with cover songs that showcase their versatility and range, and this is one of the best.These stop-gap EPs often tend to get overlooked, but In Memory remains an important chapter in the Nevermore legacy, and one that all Nevermore fans should own."
4,"Lovely pictures,beautiful words...","The late Joseph O'connell was a master sculptor,craftsman andartist,whose main work, it appears was liturgical.thereby consigning him to a lesser place among artists in this era. Too bad,for his work leaps off the page,full of life and mirth,celebration and deep pathos. He seemed to understand suffering in a way that was not self-indulgent,and portrayed it in stone,magnificently.He did hands very well, touching, probing holding caressing, and for me they seem to hold the key to some of his works. My only complaint is that this book is quite expensive,though handsomely done.Funny when reading this I felt more comfortable listening to Count Basie and Louis Armstrong then Ambrosian chant or William Byrd. Perhaps that too, is a tribute to this fine, wonderful artist."
4,Don't judge a book...,"This is an exceptionally cool album from a band that sounds like the bastard child of Smashing Pumpkins and Fugazi. Melody and angst alternate to create cool, heavy borderline-hardcore textures at times. Melodic guitars and cool but appropriately sparse use of keyboard work real well on this record. The only thing I dont get is the weird 70's cover and band name, which is probably some weird regurgitation of american culture from this european outfit. Much better than most of the modern angst rock coming out of the US right now."
2,"""Everything slides off the bed!""","I bought these thinking that it would be a nice change from our normal everyday sheets, but we have not had a good night's sleep since putting them on our bed. The sheets and the comforter keep sliding off the bed and we're constantly having to fix the bedding all night long. The sheets themselves, feel great, but it's like being on slippery slide. Now I realize that there was a reason that that they were only $29.99. Sometimes things are just too good to be true!"
1,RIP-OFF,"I should have known that for the price of $15.00 you just can't get good sheets - but, fool that I am, I ordered 2 sets. Immediately, I knew when I put them on the bed, this was a real rip-off. They do not stay in one place. They constantly move around. You can't even put your blanket on top without the sheet moving around. I gave them away to a less fortunate person. I guess if you can't afford anything better, it's OK to use. A. Franks"
3,Average,Nice chocolate color! Feels silky but not not as soft as some silk sheets. Material does not look hemmed very well at edges. I would say this is an average product but Im sure you could find something cheaper or of better quality at this price.
1,WARNING: Sand Paper Satin,"I was excited at first to see a great deal on a Satin Sheet Set. But the saying is true in this case: ""You get what you pay for"". The sheets are shiny yes, but have the comofort of 40 grit sand paper. I knew immediately that they would have to be returned the second I felt the fabric. I was very dissapointed to say the least."
2,olive sheets,"ordered the sheets came as promised the sheets were nice looking but didnt fit the bed right ordered cal king and they were too short and they wouldnt stay on the bed, they started to unravel on the pillow cases 2 days on the bed."
3,Slippery and poor fit,I was miserable in these sheets. They were slippery and not only did I slide around in bed but my blankets would slide right off as well. The mattress sheet was very lose and did not fit my mattress very well. Overall it was a waste of my money. I might try them out again in the summer to see if they are cool in the hot weather.
5,An absolute bargain.,"Soft, silky satin. Is there anything more luxurious? These sheets fit standard and thicker mattresses. At $30.00, even us poor working stiffs can enjoy sleeping like royalty."
2,Not very satisfied,"Hi! Just got my sheets the other day. I ordered the taupe color that is shown, but it doesn't look anything like the color that is on your monitor. I wanted a 'warm', earthy color sheet, but ended up with gold. Yes, the color is more like a light tan/gold. Also, I have a full bed and ordered the same size sheet. Although the package reads that it is made for a full bed, it is way too big. It seems to fit more like a queen size. I had to tuck the sides under in order for it to fit. I put them in the wash and am hoping that they shrink in the dryer."
4,"slippery on one side, rough on the other","The fitted sheet has elastic that wraps the circumference of the sheet so it fits snugly around the mattress. It hasn't slipped off my mattress yet. It's very difficult to make a neat bed because the flat sheet slips off very easily. When I slip into bed, the underside of the flat sheet (the not so shiny side) has a slightly rough feel to the skin. I was afraid to use the sheet because the fabric did not look or feel breathable but because of the light and slippery feel, I did not wake up feeling sweaty. I now sleep with the flat sheet upside down so it doesn't feel so rough."
3,They didn't wash well,"These sheets were purchased for a guest bedroom and have not been used very much.They have now been used and laundered on six occasions and I think it is time to replace them.They have started to pill quite badly and the hem is coming down a little at the bottom.They have served reasonably well, I have told they were nice and slippery and a lovely color.Overall I have been pleased with this purchase."
5,"Nice prints, WATERPROOF! ink, easy to use","I tried a canon 850 and got a drop of water on a print. The water destroyed the print. That moved me to the Epson. The inks will still last more than 20 years and they are waterproof. I held the first print under the faucet, with the water running, and it held up superbly. A few minutes later, after drying, it looked perfect.The print quality is very good. We shoot family/nature photos with an Olympus 740 3 mg camera and the quality of 8x10 prints is very good. When people say 'wow' when you tell them you printed the photo at home that tells the story.The software is easy to use. I particularly like the print management software since I use Adobe photo albumn and elements to handle all the photos."
2,not impressed,I bought this printer and used it until I had to change the print cartidge. the ink holders are very flimsy and the clip broke without any undue pressure. needless to say it was not worth fixing. The picture were average but for the money were okay. replaced it with a epson r3oo and so far this one is much better made and the prints are great. price was reasonable too.
1,Terrible printer,"It was OK for about 13 months, but has given me lots of problems since then. Basically it won't print, and a piece of plastic has broken off it so it's really had it now.I'm going to buy a new printer, and it won't be an Epson!"
1,Another piece of Epson Junk,"This is the third Epson printer I've owned and it will be my last.All three printers died about 13 months after purchase. My guess is Epson puts a chip in these things that's activated when you first plug the thing in. It keeps track of the days elapsed. When the printer gets past the warranty period, it activates another chip that clogs the print heads. This requires you to use up three or four cartridges of GENUINE EPSON ink at $25 a crack so they get you for another $100 bucks before you give up in frustration and ditch the piece of Chinese made junk in the American landfill.I'm sick of being ripped off like this. I'll outsource all my printing and have it done on real photo paper.Don't buy this rip-off machine."
5,Another Vietnam Masterpiece,"In the literary realm of Vietnam, this work another of the masterpieces. The stories here ring authentic and passionate. The book follows a grunt whose self-examination is beyone many of the pieces written to date, but is true to the internal conflict of grunts in 'Nam. The book is a noteworthy example of the angst theat captured both those who fought, but those who stayed home.Ron Lealos author of Don't Mean Nuthin'"
1,Wow,"How in the world can this book get such good reviews? This is one of the worst books I've ever read. If you're looking for a good read about Vietnam, try ""Matterhorn""."
1,Disappointing,"""The best work of fiction to come out of the Vietnam War""? ""This is the way it was""? Due to the tremendous reviews, I sought long and hard for this book. I was truly disappointed. I found the book hard to read and had to force myself to finish the book. Fortunately, the latter part of the book dealing with the return home was more captivating. There are many, many more worthwhile works of fiction on the Vietnam War. I would not recommend this one. Try James Webb's ""Fields of Fire"". I also liked his post-war fiction ""Lost Soldiers""."
3,Too much bad language,Why is it that most war stories have to have such bad language. I know that in real life people use it but that does not mean it has to be used to create a good story. Many times I have laid aside a book or not reccomended it simply because of the bad language used. The story is ususally good but I can't hack the language.
2,Close Quarters Audible CD,"Close Quarters: A NovelFrom a strictly female point of view, I found the story very rambling and a comentary about sex and war (duh). Even though there was a story line, it seemed disguised by the language and the way it was written. The story line was very simple; go to Vietnam, talk about sex, listen about sex, have sex, watch your friends die, killing, talk about it, come home and have sex, and finally marry. I kept thinking the story would get interesting but it never did. Perhaps it could be enjoyed by a man, but ""I just didn't get it"".In addition to the foul language and repeated denigration of women, it was read by a man that used a mostly monotone manner. I guess boring would be sufficient to call it."
4,Entry level poetry at it's best,"If you're looking to expand your horizons into the world of poetry, this is an excellent place to start. A wonderful collection."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"This was a disappointing book. It's only 64 pages, and each page has a single quotation on it - nothing in-depth, no context, nothing. It might be cute as a gift book to someone, but doesn't have much value on its own."
2,Confusing passwords between pc and unit; Not NEVO workable.,"I'm disapointed, because it's not easy to set up installation. Connection to one of my computers depended on some ""codes"" of access, one of wich was easy (setting up a code to each user logging in Windows). The other one was almost impossible to me, and it worked in one of my computers and not in the other.The MAIN DISAPOINTMENT, tough, is the FALSE afirmation that it could run as Remote Control for all appliances in the house. Viewsonic and Nevo says that (Nevo even has some sites showing it) but NEITHER ONE of them gives you or sell you the IR adaptor anymore. So forget it. You can't use it as a Nevo Remote Control. I bought for that purpose, so that's why I'm giving bad review for this product. I'm having some fun with it, but I'm not in the MOOD to tell that."
2,the price,"the price is not as good as other places, you can get better price even in home depotis not worth to wait for day when you can get it right away cheaper"
1,Not helpful,"The important information is wedged between oodles of footnotes & reference notations making its usefulness difficult, especially for a quick reference guide.I returned the book."
4,A satisfying read,"I enjoyed this book....the photography, the layout, and the writing are all pleasing. The twenty-three interviews with the ""ladies of the lake"" are lively and illuminating. Each one tells something about the Lake Placid area and history as well as the individual's own story. The themes of family and place will strike a chord with readers who are ""rooted in water"", as well as with those who have found their family and place in other settings. The book is a satisfying read. The time it takes to read it will pass quickly."
4,WONDERFUL,THIS BOOK WAS ALONG THE SAME LINE AS OTHER ROBBI SOMMERS BOOKS. WONDERFUL IMAGES. WORTH READING!
5,"Finally, a great desk lamp!","I've lost count as to how many desk lamps I've bought, trying to find at the least, a decent one. Well, this lamp is a GREAT one.The base of the lamp is heavy, allowing the neck of the lamp to extend clear across my desk [a generous 40""+]without tipping or falling over. The off/on switch is located in the cord, and very easy to use. The hood of the lamp is wider than most, and gives off a generous amount of light.All in all, for $39.99, you can't go wrong.UPDATE 8-23-08: This lamp literally fell apart ONE month after I posted this review.My apology to anyone who bought it on my recommendation!"
1,Worked great....until it broke!,"I took the advice of the previous reviewers and bought this lamp.It WAS heavy and sturdy, and it DID give off great work lighting.So what's my gripe? Well, two months into having this lamp, the PLASTIC screws that adjust the lamp head and hood broke off.....not because of over use, but because they're made of CHEAP PLASTIC. Now the lamp just sits there, the lamp head and hood hanging uselessly.$50, and I got an albatrose!"
2,Wheres The Line To See Jesus?,"I feel like Christmas was sucked out of this movie, sadly to say, I would have liked to see a more traditional message tied in with this since its suposed to be the Christmas carol. I recomend flintstones version over this."
5,Barbie Christmas Carol,My 6 and 7 year olds love this movie and have watched it 7 or 8 times since I got it about 3 weeks ago. I have tried to get them to watch the movie versions but they didn't like them and wouldn't sit through them. With this version they sit glued to the screen or try to dance and sing with the characters.John R. Johnson
3,Christmas Carol remake,"I love the original Christmas Carol story, and really didn't like it being tinkered with, but my little one loves Barbie, so we bought it. She loves it, and hasn't had her classical sensibilities offended...yet! However, I have to say, although I only gave it 3 stars because, as I said, I don't like when classic stories are changed, I do enjoy Barbie movies, and find them quality viewing for everyone in the family. If you can get past a female Scrooge type character with a diva attitude, you should survive this one unscathed."
4,Very satisfied,We received our order within the time specified and we were very pleased with the product.
4,Great girls movie,Any girl who likes Barbie will enjoy this movie. It is a nice adaptation of the classic story.
5,Great movie for my young daughter.,My 3 year old (almost 4) daughter loves this movie. We had to explain some things to her the first couple of times that she saw it. She's really into Barbie right now and some of the Barbie movies I feel are really inappropriate for her to watch but this one was very nice and had a wonderful message.
5,daughters love it!,"I didn't buy this movie from amazon, but I rented it at Family Video. My daughters loved it! It's got a great moral lesson, and lots of prety stuff! :)"
1,Barbie is surprisingly unkind to her sister.,"After reading the many positive reviews for this movie, my wife and I thought it would be a better choice for my daughter than Diamond Castle. We were wrong. We were very shocked by the uncharacteristically spoiled and haughty attitude that Barbie showed to her sister Kelly at the very beginning. It was vastly different than any of the other Barbie videos we have seen and not at all something we would want our daughter to emulate. The rest of the story wasn't particularly good--there were a few good moments, but it was by far the worst of any of the other Barbie movies we have seen. Don't waste your money on this movie."
2,Very slow and boring,this movie was so slow I even almost fell asleep.. its a little to advanced for anyone under 5 and I have smart grandkids.. way to long
1,"IF YOU ARE GHEY THEN YOU""LL LIKE THIS","If you listen to POP and then start listening to this and say Ja rules tight, Then YOU KNOW NOTHING. You jUst think this because he raps POP featuring POP/R&B SINGERS and your probably a girl or ghey!"
1,Sigh.. where is hip-hop headed?,"First of all, this is garbage. It isnt hip hop, this is pop trash made for the radio, similar to n'sync and backstreet boys. If you actually enjoyed this cd you have no taste for music. This is a disgrace to it's genre. It's hard to believe that money hungry hypocrites like Ja Rule are changing the respectable face of hip hop to something so terrible, pop. I rate this one star, the bottom of the ladder, among the Nelly and the other garbage made for the radio and MTV.p.s. If you want to hear a true hip hop album, check out someone like Talib Kweli/Hi-Tek or Cormega or Mos Def or Xzibit, true hip hop artists."
3,Ja goin Soft?,"Remember when his debut CD dropped, we had this kid with maaad skills spittin his murder music. Anyone expectin the same will be dissapointed with this lp. But then again, that's good. We see that Ja has enough skills to spit two different types of rap and still sound ill. He comes to this with an R'n'B feel on the 'Between me and You' and 'Put It On You'. But then Ja shows us he ain't gon'e soft when he brings his Muderah's on 'Die' and 'F*** You.' Originally a disappointment, but stand and see what Ja is doing. the you'll see the class behind this album."
4,THIS ALBUM IS ALRIGHT,I LIKE THIS ALBUM EVEN THOUGH IT IS A BIG LEAP BACKWARDS FROM VENNI VETTI VICHI. I WAS SOME WHAT DISS APOINTED IN THIS ALBUM. I THOUGHT I WOULD HEAR BETTER.
3,Ja Rule Did It Aiigth With This One,"Let me start off by saying that this album is nothing like his ""classic"" debut, with that being said, it's still 100 times better than his two next realeases.He definitely knows how to make hits. Everybody has heard ""Between Me and You"" and ""Put It On Me"" which is two great summerjams. But other than that there's really a few other listenable songs. The first song ""Watching Me"" kicks the album off very well.Here are a rating of the songs I think are worth listening to.- Watching Me 4.5/5- Between Me and You 4/5- Put It on Me 4.5/5- 6 Feet Underground 4/5- Love Me, Hate Me 4/5- F--- You 4/5- Extasy 4.5 (Great Club track)The rest of the album I really never listen to.So are 7 tracks worth the price? Yeah, especially if you get it at a reasonable price. You might notice that I didn't rate any of the songs a 5 star rating, that's bacause none of the songs are classics. Just good/great. 3.5 stars for this Ja Rule."
1,Don't waste your time,"Please do not buy this CD. Ja Rule displays little or no talent on this album, which should really be in the ""pop"" category not ""rap"". Ja spends half the time trying to sing with his annoying gravel like voice which is extremely annoying. However he is better off singing than attempting to rap where he is even worse. Still, he will sell millions of albums because kids will just buy whatever is on MTV. Instead of listening to ""pop rap"" like Ja Rule and Nelly, I highly reccomend listening to true hip-hop like Rakim, Talib Kweli, The Roots, and Nasty Nas in his masterpiece Illmatic."
3,*RULE 3:36*,"From Ja Rule comes a new type of album called ""Rule 3:36"". Since his first CD to now his second Ja Rule has become more better at the game than ever before! This hot new CD features hot songs that can be heard on HOT106 or JAMN94.5 such as Between me and you and put it on me! This CD also features some of today's hottest stars like Christina Milian, Vita, and Lil' Mo. This is the second out of four CDs that he has going I heard because on his last he's going to quit, so buy this...I urge you...besides...they might even be collectibles someday!!!"
1,"Wack, Wack, Wack, Wack, Wack Complete and utter waste!","Never did like Ja. Not even the club joints to be honest. Only reason I think he's popular is the association with Jay.This album is unbelievably weak. God damn, who approves the pressing of this stuff. Which company exec. says ""OK, print?"". I guess fools like me actually buy it. In my defence though, I waited until I got it free through a music club. Phew!. Sorry Ja Rule. Seek Jah son, and maybe your lyrics might improve.Damn I wish I had dubbed this from a friend. Then nagain that would be a waste of a perfectly good blank.Kader"
2,What Is This?,"I loved Ja Rule's first album ""Venni Vetti Vecci"" so I expected this to be another great hardcore rap album. Boy was I wrong, I guess Ja decided to go pop to sell more records, what a sellout. Where's the emotion & pain that made his first album so great? Where's the hardcore don't ... with me kind of style I loved so much? Wherever it is it's not on this album. This CD isn't completely horrible I do like ""Put It On Me"" & ""I Cry"" because he shows some emotion, but they sound more like R&B than Rap. If you like Ja's hardcore style from his first album you should stay far away from this, but if you like R&B you might wanna check this out."
3,Stright,I like this album as much as his first album. It is not bad or the best but you have to fast forward some tracks. One thing I do like about both his album's is his intro's. A lot of people agree with me too.
2,A 17 YEAR OLD'S OPINION ON THE DEMISE OF JA RULE & RAP,"WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS CD I WAS SO PISSED. IT'S HAPPENED TO ANOTHER FORMERLY HARD RAPPER, HE'S GONE SOFT TO SELL.IT'S REMINESENT OF A RAPPER BY THE NAME OF NAS THAT PUT OUT ARGUABLY THE BEST RAP CD EVER W/ ILLMATIC THEN WENT COMMERCIAL.JA SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN THIS SAME FALL. WHETHER BY CHOICE OR NOT I GUARANTEE AFTER 1-2 MORE ALBUMS JA WILL BE MAKING A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO REGAIN THE REAL HIP-HOP AUDIENCE AFTER THE 13 YEAR OLD GIRLS HE CHANGED TO SELL TO MOVE ON TO ANOTHER ICON.AROUND THE TIME ""CAN I GET A"" WAS IN HEAVY ROTATION COMPARISONS TO A YOUNGER 2PAC WERE BEING MADE ABOUT JA. THESE WERE LUDIROUS. RAP HAS TAKING A DOWNWARD TURN IF JA AND DMX ARE THE FUTURE THAT WILL ALWAYS KEEP US LOOKING TO THE PAST AND A TIME OF REAL RAPPERS."
3,What is this?,"AHHHHHHHH, Rule we waited all this time for this????? No, No, Rule come on man give us something better! It is still tyte for anyone who is a Rule fan that is why I give it a 3.....We will be waiting for something better next time."
3,Good but not as good as the first,I feel this c.d. could have been better. First off Venni VettiVecci was hardcore and this isnt. I like this one because it gives the distinction between him and DMX. Ja can move towards the R&B side and still be felt. I have to say my favorite song on this album is Put It On Me f/Vita it is off tha chain cuz it's real. If u are a female 3:36 is for u whereas the 1st is for the fellas.
3,Awwful!!,"Absolutely no creativity. It is worst than his first album. The only reason that I bought it is because Jayo Felony is on it. I like the song ""Love me,Hate Me"" and ""Extasy"" but that's it. I would not buy it if I had the choice."
1,s***s trippin da wrong whay,"Maan, ima venda spenda of dis shizzi hur but fur shur, iz hord cor poor. I meanz what I be sayin is I be buyin all the hip s*** but when i play dis on ma player my mind be hurtin, in da bad way. So fow sho, to all da playaz out thay stay clean of this bad crack, itll hurt yow mind and yow poket.Fur shur dis is da Flippa, keep it clean boyz (yea, you punks now what I be sayin)"
5,Da BEST RAP CD EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ja rule is the greatest ever..this abum has a mix of Hardcore, undergroung and R&B. he is a great lyricist. and he has tigh beats.... Beleve me he is the greatest this alum went double platnum in 4 months and it is still in the billboard charts at high positions.............."
3,what the fxck is this??,"i bought ja rule's first cd....his debut soon after it came out and i loved that shxt....had an attitude, had style, had something that all he artists around didn't have...this follow up is such to opposite....has the style of swiss beats...and i hate that shxt....no deep base..all this trumpet, silencer gun shots...i can't stand how artists change their style..its sounds just like DMX went like...he had the best album ever made almost 'its dark and hell is hot' and then went off on a different style on the next two albums...i can't stand this...'die' has a style more like the old album and grabbed myattention..but other than that, this album is disapointing...if u like the more recent 'ruff ryder' type styles then this album is for you, if u like the old ja rule then dont go buy this album, its NOT for you"
3,HE'S A LOVER MAN.,"Ok!what happen to the old Ja Rule he use to rap about gangsta and killing on his first album,now his new album I bought last week,he now rapping about love.Ja Rule is not the same person,what happen to his old style,what happen to his bad side huh.His first cd is way more better is tight and good beat,but his second cd RULE 3:36 ""well"" is not a tight cd at all.The only song I only like is track# 2,3,4,5,6,14and 7.The track I don't listen is track# 8 F&#k you,11. EXTASY,12.it's your life,and I CRY.So I was a little disappointed of this album and Ja Rule is not the same,he's a lover man."
3,Ja goes soft,"Ja sophomore album is boring to me except for a headful of songs like ""One of us"", ""Me and u"" and ""The Rule won't die"". Ja makes gangsta-rap which everybody must admit but his 1st attempt was better. ""Venni vetti vecci"" was way much betta to which I would give 4-stars because this is gangsta-rap and ain't a Black Star or Roots type hip hop. That's what y'all must take into consideration when y'all rate this CD. As being gangsta-rap, this CD ain't wrong but ain't good. Average. Told!"
3,ok but...,"This cd could of been a lot better!The first one was tight!But you might wana get ""Death Row To Gangster For Radio"".Ja Has a tight song on it and makaveli rips it up!2003"
4,It's real hot!!! Recommended to all,"Ja Rule's new album is out and is really good, all should check it out! JANADA 4 Life!!"
3,How can I say.....,"You know,it's OK but not the best.I gotta say 1st is better.But if you like Ja you like this,'cause I like this."
1,JA (doesn't) RULE,"Apart from ""Between me and you"" feat. Christine Milan this album isn't the greatest. I'd suggest that you buy the single for ""Between me and you"" or download it. Ja Rules voice my be catchy but after a while it get boring. I Suggest you don't buy this album."
1,I don't get it!!!,"To classify this as ""music"" is to do the word a disservice. I listened to all sixteen cuts and found nothing commendable about any ONE of them. The owner of the disc, my younger brother, could not change my impression.Four-letter words mixed with masochistic and narcissistic ramblings done by an angry ""brutha"" do not make music to MY ears."
3,would be 4 stars if,I didnt have to hear this on the radio so much and had to listen people sing it all the time. I liked the first Jarule but not this 1 dont get it if you dont like to hear a lot of radio type cuts get it if u do
4,3:36,"Ja Rule's sophomore album Rule 3:36 will impress the biggest hater. Though he is not known for his lyrical skills or appealing voice, there is no doubt that Ja Rule knows how to make hit records. And after ""Holla, Holla"" scored him a platinum debut album, listeners should give Ja Rule a little more credit.Rule 3:36 is as solid as, if not better than, Ja Rules first joint. Produced by Murder Inc. (Irv Gotti and company), the tracks vary from pop-influenced to hardcore rap--so there's a little something for everybody. ""Between Me And You"" is that summer-sounding jam that will have ladies on the dance floor. And there are other songs (""Put It On Me"" and ""Do I Do"" featuring Case) with that same feel. But even though it's the production that makes this album worthwhile, Ja Rule proves he's got the rhymes to hang with the big dogs, on songs like ""Love Me Hate Me"" and ""6 Feet Underground."""
3,Not as good as his first,"This cd is a awsome cd if you where a fan of the ""murders inc."" but I wasn't. His first cd was dope but this one lack good beats I find them to ... Techno (electronic)I'd say if you like Cash Money and Murders inc. then you'll probably like this one."
1,The Wackest Of All Time,"How could people like this garbage? The guy has no charisma, no lyrics, and no beats. This album is the epitomy of wack. I listened one time and broke it in half and burned the pieces of disc to nothing. If you want a newer album I suggest the new Reflection Eternal - Train of Thought, MOP - Warriorz, Deltron - 3030, Prodigy - HNIC, Afu-Ra - Body Of The Life Force, or Guru - Jazzmatazz Vol. 3: Streetsoul"
1,"This is a total disgrace, and its no way hip hop","Im sure im gonna be branded a ""Hater"" for this review, but im not, just Ja Rule is the most desperatly under talented rapper around, Him and all his crew(DMX Jay-Z and others) I had the misfortune to hear this Sh*t a week ago and i felt i had to get this of my chest; THIS IS NOT HIP HOP!! its not even rap, its just some fool talking crap over tame beats. Its just a shame that were at a point were its this kind of record that people all over the globe mistake for rap. Its this knid of record that gives rap its bad name with people. Lets all pray that ""Rule"" gives up his mic after this Abomination. I only gave it one star because i wasnt allowed to give it none."
2,Murda IS over,The Inc is Gone and it wont be back deal with it ppl.this cd [is bad] and almoust all the sungs are made for girls.if you like hard rap go buy some 90's rap
3,Classic Ja Rule Material,"well, this cd is just ja rule. what else is there to say? it's great if you like ja rule, but if you don't, forget it. I recomend this to rap/r&b fans."
4,"good, but not his best","This was a pretty sweet CD. This album is alot ""lighter"" than his last album. If you liked ""between me and u"" you'll probably like ""put it on me"" which is also a good song. Good tracks: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7."
1,ja rules no only soft but..,"i use to like this guy, until he got GEY. He should change formats and not call himself a Rap artist, but a Pop Girl.GIRLS LIKE HIM, GUYS USED TO!All he raps about is ROMANCE, and other POP topics. He used to be my fav artists, but no i refuse to listen to him."
2,What happened?!,"This album is the beginning of the end of the real Ja Rule. Venni Vetti Vecci and this album are on opposite ends of the spectrum. Unfortunately, Ja has decided to pander to the teeny bopper audience. This move has undoubtedly netted him more sales and money, but he has become a sell out in the process. Either that, or he never recovered from getting slammed by DMX on Funk Flex mixtape Vol. 4."
4,maxamillion,"This review was great.it was a great experince on different music in history today. I also want to say i am a music expert and what I see and hear from this review and website which is zthing .com is so funny and different.From this review I have seen how people see things the way I do and, how i learned on different types of music in our history music culter today.This review and website is great I log on every day to see and read new things and everytime I log oN, I always read and experince something new.I LOVE THIS WEBSITE IT ROCKS.Oh and one more thing I am so glad they made this website I am so interested in it ."
4,An accidental but wonderful discovery,"I watched this on Netflix while looking for something to watch on a boring night when nothing was on tv. Very well made, touching movie, uplifting and sad. No hollywood ending here. Never even heard of this, but so glad I watched it."
1,Foul language offensive,"Yes, it was a good story. But was all the foul language necessary to telling the story? I would be ashamed and embarassed to share this movie with any of my friends. Why do movie makers think such language enhances a film? I am afraid it reflects America's moral today? Sad, sad...."
4,Solid adventure flick,"The Bottom Line:A well-made film about an arrogant bush pilot and a sick Inuit woman stranded in the Canadian wilderness, The Snow Walker doesn't do anything notably or exceptionally well but it moves quickly and never insults the audience's intelligence; if you're the type of person--as I am--who likes stories about survival, you could do a lot worse than The Snow Walker.3/4"
4,Snow Walker Review,"This is a film based on a true story about a proud, arrogant war veteran who crashes his airplane while carrying a sick Eskimo young woman to a hospital in the tundra.She saves his life and teaches him how to survive and they begin a friendship that grows into a beautiful thing. He cares for her as her condition worsens and becomes a more respectful loving person in the process.I really liked this film in so many ways, it was refreshingly about sacrificial caring for another and respect. Great movie!"
4,A beautiful movie,"This is a beautiful movie with enthralling panoramic cinematography; a moving tale about a young white man who thinks he knows everything forced to depend upon a ""primitive, ignorant"" and dying Native American for his very survival after his plane crashes en route to a hospital where he has promised to bring her for care.Keep the River on Your Right - A Modern Cannibal Tale"
3,Just okay,"I typically sort my movie choices by average reviews, so I was surprised that a film with such strong reviews would end up so bland. As military officers, my husband and I had enormous difficulty accepting the mistakes that this prior military pilot made in his attempts to survive in the wilderness. They were so over the top and egregious that it became difficult to accept the concept that he was once a hot-shot pilot in WWII, a very important part of his character. Second, the acting was rather atrocious particularly from his female co-star. Her attempts to learn and speak English were fully free of any accent whatsoever. I kept hoping it would turn into a fantastic movie based on all these wonderful reviews but found it lacking in emotional connection and believability."
5,An amazing adventure film that most of the family can enjoy!,"An amazing adventure film that most of the family can enjoy (nothing really offensive, except for a bar scene in the beginning...and a scene of two lovers waking up in bed together...no nudity or sex though). Most of the film centers around the survival of a stranded pilot and a native girl who are both lost in the Canadian tundra. It's beautifully done and very well acted.I just wish it had been a bit longer.The director was the star of 'Never Cry Wolf', a similar (but not nearly as exciting), film. Watch the 'making of' on the dvd...it's incredible what they went thru to make this film.Highly recommended."
5,Wonderful,"Barry Pepper did a wonderful job, yet again. The relationship between his character and the Inuit girl is honest, and very relatable. Two lonely people of different background and cultures, sharing an ordeal that brings a mutual respect and understanding. Loved it."
5,he had to learn to snow walk first,"This movie depics the ""civilized man"" having to learn how to survive in an ""uncivilized"" environment. A man crashes his plane in a desolate are in the arctic region with a sick native on board who he was transporting to a hospital. They could not communicate. To me, the irony of the story is that the civilized man who looks down upon the natives as being backward and stupid, would have died in that barren land if it weren't for the survival skills of the sick native woman. While the pilot has temper trantrums, the woman takes out her little fishing pole and catches a fish. While the pilot uses up his matches in the rain on his trek to find help, she finds him and saves his life. It is a story you can learn from. Like what is important in life, and a story of friendship."
5,We are all human,"Loved this movie; although I hadn't read The Snow Walker, I had read The Deer People by Farley Mowat and saw part of that integrated into the movie here. The actors are top notch, the scenery is breathtaking, and the story is so timeless and relevant to all cultures around the world."
4,Robert Lowell was a transgressive artist???,"OK, the foreword almost made me throw away the book right there. Its first sentence reads `Robert Lowell was a transgressive artist.'This sounds like a parody of a 1980ies English lit major thesis - mercifully you can skip the foreword as it doesn't add anything at all. It's short though so skipping is easily done.The selection itself is generous and one gets a good idea of Lowell's breadth of writing styles. As another reviewer has noted this edition is probably all you need."
3,"Ok, but a tad melodramatic","This was the first pregnancy book I read. Frankly, I found it a bit scary. The authors clearly had a very hard time with conception and with their small-town North Carolina doctors. That seems to have made them a tad fanatical about moms-to-be doing *everything* ""right"" or they'll never have a child. And I'm not sure the authros' (expectation and) experience of homophobia is particularly informative for those of us in more progressive settings. I very much appreciate the info. I got from the book; now I just have to try not to worry."
3,In Agreeance,"I agree with the other reviewer - their emphasis on timing having to be perfect has caused quite a lot of anxiety for me. After all, there's only so much we can control about this process and the rest is part nature, part luck. I would reccomend this book to someone doing home IVI's with fresh sperm, but it will only cause more angst to those doing frozen IUI's with their doctor."
5,very helpful place to start,This is a great book. It is a very helpful overview of the decisions you face when trying to get pregnant as a lesbian. I highly recommend this book.
4,Intel Desktop Board D865GBF,The Product was received in good time and works great. Very Dissapointed that I did not recieve a boxed product like I thought I was receiving. Also Dissappointed that I did not receive the Backplate. Now I have a big hole in the back of my computer. I am hoping the Seller will see this and send it because I really need it and it should have came with it considering the Audio ports are not arranged in a standard fashion. But Overall I am satisfied.
5,Gourmet in a hurry,"After much searching and reading reviews on pressure cookers, I finally decided on the Cuisinart EPC-1200 and have not regretted it a moment. It worked perfectly and has turned out delicious, slow cooker tasting meals in a fraction of the time. The ability to brown, saute and cook in the same pot helps tremendously. You can't get a better product than this."
2,Leaking seal ring!,"I always use pressure cooker to prepare meat and soup and i love using them. I used my other 2 cookers for over 3 years while this one only lasted for 3 months. The seal ring has been aged very soon. After less than 10 times usage in 3 months, the cooker couldn't press because of the leaking seal ring. I called customer service to replace the seal ring, but they asked me to pay 20$ shipping fee to send the cooker back to factory. Well, we will see what happens next!"
5,Pressure cooker convert,"I was very nervous about using a pressure cooker, so I bought this electronic pressure cooker because I thought it would be easier to use than a regular stovetop cooker. I was not disappointed!The manual could definately be clearer. I had to read some of the directions through a few times, but I was still able to put it together fairly quickly. There are only a few settings, so there really isn't much to figure out.It worked perfectly the first time. I made a pot roast, and it was delicious. It's also nice that it automatically switches to ""keep warm"" once the cooking cycle is over. Moverover, I got the best part of making a roast (the great smell throughout the house) without heating up my house. All in all, it wasn't nearly as scary as I thought it would be. I only wish that I had purchased a pressure cooker sooner!"
4,Presssure Cooker,"The pressure cooker is a new design, is safer than older pressure cookers and seems to work as advertised. We have purchased two more for our daughter-in-laws."
1,Aviod this pressure cooker,"I bought this cooker two weeks ago. It worked the first time I used it. Then I could never get it to come up to pressure again. I too called Cuisenarts customer service and all they could say was add more water. That didn't work. The float valve I believe is just not good. Too much steam and water escape from it. A worker in a department store told me that she has this cooker and it can take up to 40 minutes to come up to pressure. So if I want to cook white rice which should take only 3 minutes for one cup, I have to wait 40 minutes to come up to pressure! Better to just cook on the stove in a saucepan! I returned the cooker for a full refund!"
1,Worked great for 2 years....Now I need to BABY SIT the pressure cooker...,"I really wanted to love this pressure cooker....I bought this unit from Amazon in Jan 2010 so we could make meals faster. It was wonderful for the first 2 years. We cooked rice, made soups, and stewed meant. The results were pretty good. However, it is a different story now. Somehow now I have to tap on the release valve to get it seal for multiple times when cooking a dish. At times it could not hold pressure and I would need to reset the menu. So I would have to ""baby-sit"" my pressure cooker. Trust me I do know how to place the release valve in the right position after all I did it right for the first 2 years.I think I need to call Cuisinart and hopefully the process would not be too painful..."
3,Need more recipes,The few times I have used this it is OK. I guess I need more receipes to try to see if it was worth purchasing.
4,Functional wise is good. But the quality......,It cooks well. But.....The lcd display is broken and you can't see the full digit from it. And inner pot layer wore out.
1,Worst cooker ever,"The cooker can't enter high pressure mode because it leaks. It stopped working after 6 months. I already throw away the packaging and it's so difficult to find proper packages to send it back. I opened the cooker to check the circuit. The cooker is extremely cheap made. The wires are all extremely thin. They use the same wires for button and heater. I can't believe such wire can sustain 10A current. The 12V transformer is dead. I can order another transformer or provide 12V from outside but considering the overall experience, I would rather throw it away to trash where it should belong. A 10$ cooker will work much better than this."
1,start leaking gas after 4 months of use.,"the cooker worked well for months ,but it started to leaking gas in high pressure, anyone know how to fix that ?"
5,Fast Delivery,"Received the product in 3 days. It was delivered via Fed Exp. Saturday Morning. I am anxious to start using the cooker. After reading the instructions, it looks like it will be easy to use and much better then my 20 yo cooker I have been using."
4,Why didn't they think of this before,"I received this for Christmas 20008 and have been using it for almost 10 months. Before I received this I found pressure cookers too much work and too dangerous to use. This appliance removes those problems. However, this appliance is not without a quirk of its own--i.e. you must make sure the float valve is clean and free moving before you start cooking or the appliance will shut off before it finishes cooking. Keep the float valve clean and you'll love your pressure cooker."
5,WorksVery Well!,"This pressure cooker worked very well right out of the box. After assemblying the various parts (easy), I was able to make an old family recipe for soup that my father makes with his 6-QT Presto Cooker. The timing for the recipe was exact and translated well with the Cuisinart. I also tried a Short Ribs recipe and it also came out perfect. The recipies provided with the cooker sound delicious and I look forward to trying a few of them.My only negative (if you can call it a ""negative"") comment is that you can only program one (1) action (i.e. low pressure, high pressure, simmer, etc) at a time-,meaning, that as soon as one command is completed, you have to program your next command. In other words, it is not possible to do multiple commands from this menu-driven keypad.Clean-up was a cinch and I store my pressure cooker in a cabinet-be advised that it is a bit heavy so be careful.I would recommend this to others."
2,Most important info not in mfr's description,"Cuisinart conveniently doesn't reveal that the 'High Pressure' setting is only 10 PSI. A quality pressure cooker should cook at 15 PSI. All recipes for pressure cookers are based on 15 PSI so I am constantly trying to figure out the correct time conversion for 10 PSI. Can you say 'substandard?' How frustrating to have to call Cuisinart to learn this pot's PSI. The point of a pressure cooker is FAST, FAST, FAST. A 3# chuck roast takes 99 minutes in this cooker....would take 35 minutes in the standard 15 PSI cooker. What a let down...if Cuisinart listed the PSI, many cooks wouldn't buy this one because of the lower PSI. There are many websites that will teach you about how to safely use pressure cookers. My favorite is the one by 'Miss Vickie""."
1,doesn't work,"The red plastic thing gets stuck on mine so that the pressure cooker setting won't engage. I have called Cuisinart and they kept trying to put it to user error. I got nowhere with them, so that is the last product I will buy from their company."
1,JUNK,"I saw numerous good reviews of the CPC-600 Electric Pressure Cooker. I should not have ignored those that were not complimentary. I have had this product for two months and the pressure cook feature has worked only ONE time. Now the unit will do nothing except beep when it's turned on. Save yourself $100 or spend it on something useful! If I could have rated this product ""no stars"", I would have done so."
5,GREAT pressure cooker. A++++,"I have a traditional aluminum pressure cooker with that little jiggly thing on top but found it very difficult to work correctly on my electric stove top. When I saw the Cuisinart electric I bought it immediately. I'm glad I did. This is so much easier than the manual stove top unit. It's basically ""set it and forget it"". I like how it automatically goes into a keep warm state after cooking. Cleanup is super easy as well. This is a very well made unit.I highly recommend this to anyone whether you are new to pressure cookers or a seasoned pro."
5,Very good machine,"Have had good results with recipes included in the instruction book. I also own another electric pressure cooker--the Wolfgang Puck--and it works well too, but the Cuisinart seems to be a bit better engineered and constructed though the actual operation of the Cuisinart is not very intuitive. You will need to read the manual carefully to set up a project. All in all--well worth the money."
1,Stopped working after 4 months,"Our pressure cooker worked for about 4 months and then we just couldn't turn it on. I thought about shipping it to the manufacturer to get it fixed but was hesitating when I saw so many negative reviews on customer service. I'll probably switch back to stove top pressure cookers - can't live without a high pressure cooker.Reading from the review statistics, at least ten percent of the product have defects (30 out of 309 customers gave one star), which is too important to be ignored when you make your purchase decisions. I wish I noticed and thought about this when I bought it last year."
5,Cusinart electric pressure cooker,"This is a great addition to anyone's kitchen! Easy to use, easy to clean, and cuts dinner prep time more than half. Highly recommended!!! Great price and quick delivery from Amazon.com."
4,great addition to the kitchen,The wife loves it; works pretty much as advertised. The only complaint I have is there is no way to know what the pressure is (i.e. 15 psig). The only indication you get is a red pop-up that says the pressure is sufficient for the timer to start.
4,Cuisinart needs a better video,The pressure cooker would not come up to full pressure and after a few minutes it put itself on warm. I called Cuisinart customer service and received no help. I finally figured out how to align the pressure valve (the little arm needs to be parallel to the handle). I suggested to Cuisinart that they remake the video to demonstrate how to put the cooker together and how to properly place the pressure valve instead of just showing how to push buttons. They could also rewrite their manual with a larger picture of how to place the pressure valve. The soups were excellent. I cooked my own recipes using 1/3 the time I normally cook them.
1,Didn't even turn on!,I purchased this model last week but didn't use it until tonight to make a corned beef & csabbage dinner..I got everything all set went to plug it in and no power no light's no nothing..so I figured I must have done something wrong or the outlet didn't work or I blew a breaker..had my husband look at as he can figure anything out and even called customer service after trying everything from a different outlet to checking the lid and so on I ended up with a defective unit from the get go..I'm so disappointed that my family will now have to wait at least 3 to 4 hours which will be 9:30 or later now before I can feed them supper because I of coarse got a defective unit that doesn't work! Instead of getting a refund I'm going to get the replacement and give it another shot..I will give a update!
4,Lingering quesiton,".Does anyone know if you can set the timer when cooker is on Simmer. Mine will not and Cuisinart doesn't seem to know either, which is amazing.Mine will work on simmer for an undetermined amount of time and then goes to keep warm.Quote from Cuisinart but not specific enough.* Simmer - This preset temperature allows you to cook liquids at a lower temperature. It is primarily used to finish cooking some items, i.e. to add ingredients to a risotto, sauce, or stew or to continue cooking process to achieve preferred textureI would LOVE to have an answer to this as I do love the cooker but this is a terrible situation.Since I got no answers from Cuisinart after them sending question to Corporate who sent it to marketing and never got back to me I took mine back but will buy another one if I can get an answer.Thanks so much."
1,No Seal,"It was very disappointing. It worked wonderful one time and then I had the same problems others had. It would heat up, but wouldn't hold its pressure. It was like it wouldn't seal to hold pressure. I think they have to make some improvements before I would try this again!"
5,Love this product,"Easy to use, as good as advertised! I have made many good meals; they are easy to find on the internet. I especially like that the meals are made using their own natural juices. I recommend this to anyone looking for a new kitchen appliance that will save time. I also live in the desert, so cooking without using surface heat is a big plus!"
4,Like the meals at Gram's house,"I had been looking into a pressure cooker for the last year or so. After multiple display/demo type viewings on a ""shopping channel"", I finally researched seriously and made this the one. I couldn't be more happy.Price at Amazon was way cheaper than anywhere else I could find it, product is as stated, meals come out delicious and quick, clean-up isnt too bad either. My only problem is most if not all the cookbooks I looked into for additional recipes are based on stovetop models. The only one I really found, and have enjoyed, is the Slow Food Fast by Bob Warden.I highly recommend if you are investing in a decent pressure cooker, splurge a little extra and get a cookbook that is truly designed for electric models."
1,Defective right out of the box,"I really wanted one of these and received mine two days before Thanksgiving. The manual is horrible but I got through it. My unit would not hold pressure right from the start. I might have just returned it and ordered another one, but the customer support person was also horrible. He had me go through the operation of the cooker then told me he did not have time to determine what was wrong. He admitted that the pressure gauge was not working. The unit would just go up to pressure and then the counter would go to zero and the unit would signal that it was done.It ruined my Thanksgiving cheesecake."
3,I like it BUT...,"I am having a VERY hard time getting the lid to close. Can anyone help with an easy application.Last time I tried to do so, I was ready to throw it through a window."
2,"Started out fine, then kaput!","This item worked almost perfectly, but then after about a month of use it just completley stopped working. I was extremly dissapointed because it made foods so tender in such a short amount of time. This item is too expense to be so shoddy. Apparently many others have had this issue based on what I see here, and on other sites. Make sure you do your warranty follow up if you decide to purchase it, there is a decent chance that it will malfunction."
1,Never worked for me so I bought a better one,"After having lots of troubles with this Cuisinart pressure cooker I decided to get a new one. I found the Tatung electric pressure cooker and whow--what a difference! I LOVE the stainless steel bowl because non-stick is supposedly not as healthy to use (the Cuisinart has non-stick). And ironically, the stainless steel on the Tatung really has a non-stick quality to it because it is so heavy and well-made. Most importantly I love the way it cooks. I am a whole-grain fanatic and love to cook grains in my pressure cooker--especially brown rice--because it takes only minutes. Always my Cuisinart electric pressure cooker had trouble sealing so it leaked, and food burned on the bottom. Basically nothing turned out very well. With the Tatung my grains are perfect with less water. I love it!"
1,"Poor quality, bad custom service","I bought this on August 29, 2009. I found the exterior non-stick layer on the bottom of the cooking pot started to peel off after I used for three times. I also saw stains on the bottom of the outer body (peeled non-stick layer). So I took the pictures and email them to the custom service. However, I was requested to send the pot back at my own cost, and I also should be responsible for the return shipping. I think the pictures I took were clear enough for the replacement, especially considering the problem came out within less than one month of purchasing. Their strategy is to wear out your patience and then take advantage of it. So disgusting!"
3,Usable but not perfect,"Worked wonderful, nevertheless, one needs to figure out the operating buttons which are not completely conformed to what manual says. A little bit simple. Does not have buttons automatically set for rice, poultry, and meat. Have to refer to recipe to set up that. But it can be quickly learned.Otherwise, it is very good."
5,The Greatest Cooking Device Out There,"I can't praise this appliance enough. It has not only produced the most tasty dishes, but it has saved me TIME and ENERGY! I use it every single day. Makes the BEST hummus - beats can beans any day. I just soak my chick peas over night, sprout them by rinsing in colander, and cook for 25 minutes. I always let the cooker release pressure naturally. I also cook my potatoes, stir fry, chili (vegetarian) and soups in this little magic wonder. VERY safe too - not like your grandma's pressure cooker! I highly recommend this particular one too - easy to clean, quiet and sturdy."
5,Absolutely love it,Almost every dish we've tried in this pressure cooker has been even better (not to mention significantly faster!) than the way we used to prepare them. Absolutely thrilled that we purchased this product. Love it.
4,Electric Pressure Cooker Easier To Use!,"we love the electric pressure cooker. it's way easier to use than traditional manual pressure cookers and allows you to ""leave"" food and tend to other chores / errands while your food cooks. with traditional pressure cookers, you have to stay alert and shut it off at the right time before you food gets overcooked, etc. no need to worry about releasing the pressure adequately as the cuisinart does it automatically for you.the lid is easy to open and water collects nicely and no need to struggle and jerk around the pressure cooker lid (as with traditional models) until it opens.i also found the buttons on the pressure cooker not intuitive on how to use and set. once you learn it, it becomes easier to use.i found the manual a bit hard to use and it wasn't intuitive (i'm not a very good cook and a total novice). the design is also a bit bulky, but i still prefer this over the traditional pressure cookers."
4,I like this product.,I like this product. Very safe and easy to use. After I used mine for a couple of months.. I bought one for my friend.
1,"Disappointed ""under pressure""","Based upon my research and a good friend's recommendation I purchased my first electric Pressure Cooker, a Cuisinart 6 qt. The seller delivered it very quickly in perfect shape. A few nights later I delighted myself and my husband with the classic ""lentil"" soup. The next night I plugged it in and nothing happened -- NOTHING. I packed it up, returned it to Cuisinart's customer service place which is very near where we live. That was almost 2 weeks ago and I have heard nothing -- no new PC or repaired PC with the appropriate apology. I have generally recommended Cuisinart as a good brand and one that does what it says it will do. I will not do that again."
2,Worked great... at first,"This cooker has been taking seemingly longer and longer to get up to pressure each time I use it. What's the point in using it to cook brown rice if it takes 20 minutes just to get up to pressure and then (according to their recipe) 10 minutes to cook, 10 minutes at natural pressure release... that's the same 40 minutes I could do it on the stove and it wouldn't turn out a gross, soupy mess!? I have had repeated issues where I followed the specific time settings in their manual for beans, rice, etc. and they were FAR from cooked. Then what do you do... you have to wait another 20-30 minutes to get it back up to pressure to try to get it to cook another 10 minutes!? Its more of a time waster than a time saver. At first it cooked things beautifully. Now I am ready to toss it. Something is definitely defective here. AND another main issue is that you cannot open it to see how things are progressing, adjust flavorings, etc. Major con."
3,Williams Sonoma selling online for $99,"I LOVE Amazon, but seems like prices are going up lately. This item is $99 online at normally pricey Williams-Sonoma.com. Also, many food items that I have purchased in the past are now much more expensive."
3,Cooking pot is not stainless steel,"As an electric pressure cooker, it works fine. But the title is confusing. The cooking pot is not stainless steel, a feature that I was looking for."
1,Typical poor Cuisinart quality,"I bought this pressure cooker with high hopes since it had gotten mostly good reviews. My luck stops there. I got the unit, put it together, and tested it with just water. Two times it would heat up to pressure and then shut down. Only one time did it cook for the 7 minutes I had picked after it reached pressure."
5,The Best Appliance You Never Knew You Needed!,"We gave this as a gift to a family member after discovering that she didn't have one. She is the cook in the family, always organizing family gatherings, holidays, etc.Well she absolutely LOVES it! And she's not just saying she loves it because we gave it to her. Lately, they've been using it almost every day to make things.I have to say, I don't recall anyone being so enthralled with a kitchen appliance. She calls it ""the best appliance I never knew I needed!"""
2,cuisinart electric pressure cooker,"I purchased the Cuisinart electric pressure cooker (6Qt )at a retail big box store in February 2012.I have used it about three times in eight months. It is difficult to set the top in locked position, and now it will not let steam build up and keeps going to 'keep warm' mode. In addition, the heat core gets so hot, it will burn food. I read a lot of reviews on line that cite the same problems. I am surprised that Cuisinart has its name on such an inferior product. I am going to purchase a Kuhn Rikon cooker and return mine to the store. Sure glad I bought the warranty."
1,Could Not Close - Returned,Yo-Well it is my own fault - I read plenty of reviews here on this cooker and bought it anyway.Right out of the box - wife and I were going to make a stew - put everything in the pot - and IT WOULD NOT CLOSE!! I messed around with this thing for a half an hour to no avail. Packed it up and returned it the very next day. Thank goodness for the GREAT Amazon return policy-eh!!We bought an Instant Pot for $20 more and what a DIFFERENCE!! Heavier by one pound - slightly more capacity - superior controls and user manual - absolutely beautiful and well built with a polished stainless steel pot that has a three ply bottom like a top quality pot or frying pan has which results in an even cooking surface!! Turned out to be a very good outcome for us-eh!!
1,Poorly manufactured,Had this cooker for one year. Suddenly it starts drying up water without cooking the food. The time no long changes after pressing Start.
1,doesn't work after several use,"Steam leaks from the float valve which can't seal. It automatically turns to ""keep warm"" before go to the pressure cooking. I would return this product and go back to slow cooker."
1,Defective,"The cooker looks nice, and worked well for exactly one week. Now it won't pressure up and goes straight to keep warm. I went through all the trouble shooting steps, cleaned it, even let it cool down etc. and after resetting it numerous times for over an hour I just gave up. This item is going back for a refund. It's really too bad, I really liked this cooker. Am replacing it with a Kuhn Rikon."
3,Good .... & stinky,"Replacing a much used unit because the cooking pot coating began to flake off.Even if you are pressure cooker pro, I would recommend reading the instructions. Though all the functions are familiar to anyone with one, there are variations that make or break success in setting them . One example is I assumed I knew what the control settings were only to be thwarted. Read it. Some other reviews indicate the instructions do not address certain things. I found all of them in my version- though had to search for points I wanted.Initially I was disappointed because the cooking pot was so light. My previous unit was heavy cast iron. I plowed ahead with a 4 lb beef roast with garlic & onions. It browned well and the finished meal was perfect.There is one serious issue: nothing has removed the onion and garlic odor from the cover sealing ring. Still trying! Will gladly upgrade rating if I can get rid the odor."
4,Ordering process,I'm sure the item is as advertize however when ordering there should be a correction period. It said free shipping! It also said if done in one hour and 5 seconds can be delivered on next day. I was not presented with the bill in total until order was placed. If so I would not have ordered. There needs to be a correction period and/or a clear presentation of bill and shipping before one places order.
2,Miss my oval pressure cooker,This one seems more complicated to me and I haven't used it yet because the instructions are difficult. Secondly I really miss the cooking surface my previous oval pressure cooker had which allowed for more room especially for browning roast or chicken. I guess this is adequate I bought it because of the reviews but really not happy with it.Yvette from NYC
1,I'm RETURNING IT ~ Can't get the Lid to Close Properly,"Closing The Lid is VERY difficult!! And unfortunately, on a PressureCooker...Sealing the Lid IS the MOST IMPORTANT PART!!!I don't want a struggle like this every time. It's SO GOING BACK!"
3,Cuisinart CPC-600 1000-Watt 6-Quart Electric Pressure Cooker review,The timer doesn't work so it's been difficult to use the Cuisinart CPC-600 1000-Watt 6-Quart Electric Pressure Cooker properly kind of frustrating.
5,Pressure Cooker,This cooker is awesome! Gave one to each of my three children for a Christmas gift and they all loved it as well. Cooks food quickly and evenly and then keeps warm until ready to eat.
2,Good when it works,"I bought thIs unit about two months ago. When it works it is great. Unfortunetly it fails to work about 60% of the time. Select high pressure, set the time and start. 5 minutes later the unit beeps to indicate it is done and the timer indicates 00. There is nothing you can do to convince the unit to work after it goes into stupid mode. I highly recommend looking for another brand. To be fair, when it works I really like it. It is easy to clean and has a decent capacity. I just want a unit that works 100% of the time."
5,AWESOME Cooker!!,"I have always struggled with stovetop pressure cookers trying to get the number of ""jiggles"" just right. This product is wonderful! Set the pressure, set the time and just wait for the beeps! All you need is a clear piece of countertop. I was hesitant to spend $100 on a pressure cooker, but I've been using stovetop models for 30 years on both gas and electric stoves and while I loved the food that came out I was avoiding cooking with them because it was so much trouble to regulate the pressure. This unit takes care of that for you, and it's really quiet! You can actually hear the TV while it cooks. I'll never go back to the stovetop type again. Highly recommended."
5,WOW,"After watching Jacques Pepin on PBS one Sunday use one of these I decided to take a look at one. I did my homework and read all the reviews including the one from the gentleman who could not seem to get it to work, and then did at a later date. I bit the bullet and ordered my cooker. I have not used a pressure cooker in years, mainly because they took so long to get up to pressure on the cooktop and because of the large amounts of hissing and spitting that went on during cooking.I have to report that this model is easy to use, very quiet,and a cinch to clean. Lamb curry in 20 minutes! Deliciously tender beef ribs in 55 minutes. And oh I forgot it browns as well so you get the wonderful taste of a fond and the look of roast meat instead of some insipid grey looking food."
1,Cusinart needs to be honest and say what PSI this is...,"The high and low power pressure are 10 and 6 psi, respectively. That means that all recipes that don't come from Cuisinart, ones used since pressure cooking has existed, are going to take longer and taste worse. We're packing this up and sending it back....there is not any point in keeping it. There is at least one other model on Amazon that actually is 15psi, the Nesco brand."
1,Cusinart Divebomb,"I used to trust this company and buy their products. But during the past couple of years, they seem to be taken over by the ""next quarter's profits must be higher"" boys. No real interest in customer service. Inferior (cost-cutting) products. Look elsewhere for kitchen appliances. Too bad. A once-great company.Now useless."
1,stay away from this Brand name. it sucks.,"I brought one from Costco and only used for 8 month, now the lid need to be replaced and it will cost me $35.00. Stat away from this product, actually stay away from this Brand name. it sucks."
4,Cuisinart 6.5 gt Electric Pressure Cooker,Love it. Easy to clean and easy to use.Wonderful for anyone who works away from homeand still needs healthy meals.
5,Great Item!!,"This was a Christmas gift. I have been nervous about using a pressure cooker, but this is amazing!! Easy to use, very impressive. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to cook using this method. It is economical, and fast!"
2,I Returned It,"It has nice features, but the complements stop there. I bought this for my mother and my daughter for Christmas. When I went to show my mother how to use it, I was very disappointed. It took too long to cook items that I can cook quickly in my own pressure cooker (which happens to be a Nesco brand electric). Most recipes are written for cooking at 15 psi. The adjustment needed is just too great for my liking. I had to add over 30% cooking time.I returned both cookers and ordered them each aNesco PC6-25P 6-Quart Electric Programmable Pressure Cooker, Stainless SteelI love mine."
4,And it is quiet too!,"It is very easy to use, set it and forget it-easy. Very safe to use. And one more rather nice feature is that it is quiet. The cooker gets the ingredients up to pressure, and then controls the pressure level, very precisely, so that the release valve hardly hisses at all."
4,Product review,"I have enjoyed the few items I have cooked so far. It is simple enough to prepare some meals. My idea is to toss the ingredients in and come back to it when it is done. Too many of the recipes require more work than this. Also the recipe book is a little short on recipes, so I found myself quickly experimenting. Overall, it is all it claims to be."
5,Great update on an old product,"Pressure cookers are well known as dangerous devices, but Cuisinart has built a nice product and made the whole concept less stressful. This cooker has done a nice job on everything we've thrown at it. I suggest a cookbook for pressure cookers to go with it, and definitely read the manual and other documentation that comes with the unit. It looks nice, and works well. The main advantage seems to be getting that slow-cooked flavor without spending all that time."
3,Has Problem to build up pressure,"I don't recommend this cooker, but we may not have a better choice. It's still the best-rating electric pressure cooker on Amazon so far. If you would like to give it a try, the price is cheaper at Costco lately.I purchased the pressure cooker 8 weeks ago. I had been pleased with it until about 4 weeks ago when the counter started to have problem to count down. When this happens, and it happens very often, the cooker would not get up to pressure, would not stop itself, but Continue to ""cook"" and lose steam.I still use it to cook dry bean - just need to keep an eye on it.When the cooker doesn't work, I'll cancel the timer(counter), wait for a few seconds, and then reset it; so far this trick works most of the time."
3,"When I finished, was I glad I'd read it?","NEGATIVES1. no quotation marks for dialogue; forced me to reread things, which irritates me2. melodramatic, yet I was caught up in the weather happenings3. the author's favorite word is ""moreover""4. abrupt ending, and wrapped up too neatlyPOSITIVES1. a change from my usual reading2. from Alfred's perspective, I learned something about prejudice3. I enjoyed the relationships between Alfred/Mesa and Alfred/PaulSIDE NOTEI was expecting pedophilia after Russell's grabbing of Alfred, followed by Terry's outraged reaction. That could've added to the melodrama and given it even more of a Danielle Steel flair.So, as you can surmise, I'm not glad I read it. If I weren't reading it for my book club, I wouldn't have finished it. (Sometimes I DON'T finish them, but this book wasn't horrible, and I was eager to finish it after I got to the part about flooding and icy roads, which was near the end. However, I felt dissatisfied when I finished it.)"
2,Big disappointment,"I'm a big fan of Chris Bohjalian and was thoroughly disappointed in his last literary offering, ""Buffalo Soldier"". The characters were pretty flat and I really was wondering why I should care about their plights. I am used to the fast paced story of ""Midwives"" or ""Law of Similars"" where a lot occurs and you are actually grabbed by what's happening to the characters.I hope his next book is more interesting. Bummer."
4,Wonderful look into the live of everyday people,"This book takes hold of the reader, right from the first page. It tells the story of everyday people living through the hard parts of life. It is strong story of family, and the fact that in todays world what makes a family has changed.Being from Vermont perhaps jades my love of the book, but I've got to say that Mr Bohjalian know this State, and understands the people who live in it."
2,Hard to get through,I found myself struggling to complete this book. I'm a big fan of Chris Bohjalian but was disappointed with this book.
4,ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL,This novel captures the human element well indeed as a married couple try to replace two daughters lost by bringing in a young boy to live with them. The construct of this story was unique (for me) as each chapter was specifically about one character in the story where you got to know and appreciate every single person involved. It was a great innovation to me and helped in the development of the story.This is a true-to-life story of what happens to individuals and families when infidelity occurs that disrupts the lives of many people and puts them on the avenue of chaos and doubt. A good read.
4,his best book,We chose this for our monthly book club selection. It was a good choice for discussion and liked by all.
3,Not the brightest jewel in the diadem...,"On the whole, this album is not a bad piece of work, and it does at times manage to evoke a sort of somber-yet-sneering malice with its highly polished production and heavy atmospherics. Plus, ""Ruin and Misery"" is almost guaranteed to get you a speeding ticket, so it's definitely a keeper. However, there are moments in which the high-gloss factor of this album renders an otherwise masterful work little more than glammish or goth-poppy. Take for example ""Raven Claws,"" a track that I -still- can't listen to without cringing in sympathetic embarassment. As a follow-up album to Wolfheart (which is also marred by occasional over-the-top swoon-goth moments,) Irreligious is worth checking out, as it offers a fine example of the evolution of this band. Yet if you aren't a serious series collector or just want a token Moonspell disc in your archive, I'd be tempted to point you toward 2003's The Antidote (oh so nice and chilling)... but, hey, it's your nickel."
3,"It is good, indeed.","But, in my opinion, pales in comparison with Wolfheart. Don't take me wrong, this is a good relase, the music is great, and the lyrics of superb quality, but there is something missing."
5,"Excellent, dark, aggressive!","I'm certainly not the expert of dark / doom / death / whatchacallit metal, but this album is certainly a good mixture for all gothic fans who also like some heavy metal. No screaming like in death metal but still very heavy with lots of harmonies."
4,Well produced showing excellent technical skills.,"Despite the caution expressed by one reviewer my book was not soiled by spilt glue! Indeed, as with all the Edition Euros books that I have (and all of the Bruno Gmunder imprints) the quality of the book is beyond criticism.As for the photographs, Messana presents an array of very 'masculine' models of the older, more pumped type. Whilst I do not particularly find this type of physique to be erotically charged, I can certainnly report that these pictures will stimulate many people who are in love with portrayals of the modern nude male. Messana seems to be able to get his camera inside the models' heads and bring out some real feeling and emotion, one of which is surely joy.So buy it, it's not expensive and is a great addition to any collection."
2,printing defect,"I exchanged the first book because one of the pages was glued to the next page. The second book had the identical problem. It looks like the binding glue got on to the page. The one picture has a white streak where the printing came off. It's a shame because the rest of the book is fine and the photographs are good. So, if you buy the book, just beware of the defect."
3,Book Defective,I also received a book where the pages were stuck together as well as where one page was just blank. Otherwise the pictures are great.
4,Xy is one cool dude,"This is a goodie worth adding to your collection if you haven't already. The guitar playing is very good and engaging in its aggressive rhythms and atmospheric power. There are tons of synthesizer work in every song creating the backbone of the album with creative and diverse sound structures and rhythms. The vocals are powerful, an understandable form of death/black growls. The songs are all well written and interesting and two have very nice piano playing in the background the whole time. The first track is definately a standout track. Very catchy. This is definitely my favorite Samael album so far."
5,The Best,This is the best Samael album there is in my opinion. Angel's Decay and Moonskin are two incredibly good songs and the rest of the album is very well composed as well.
4,Very good for death metal fans,"This is a pleasing album from Samael. The best songs are Rain and My Saviour. For some reason, Samael has a weird ability to make a small number of great songs, and a larger number of so-so songs. Most of the songs on this album are only so-so. The two I named above are great. I recommend this for any fan of Samael, and any fan of death metal."
3,DISAPPOINTING!,"I probably shouldn't review this album since I'm not a fan of Black metal but I didn't think I would like their followup album - Eternal - either, but I did, a lot. I liked Eternal so much I couldn't wait to get something else by these prodigies. I should have waited. The difference between Passage and Eternal is like black and white (no pun intended). I reminds me of the change that took place between Therion's early and later material. Passage is very boring and redundant. If you heard one song you pretty much heard all of them. In contrast Eternal is brilliant, being melodic, symphonic almost operatic with variety in tempo between songs and within songs. The only reason I didn't give Passage one or two stars is that a nifty bonus CD was included in my copy, in which the artists performed classical interpretations of 10 of passages 11 songs. This was very good 4-5 stars and worth the cost of the CD."
5,Wonderful,"After floundering trying to understand abstract computer science issues such as computability, NP-complete, Turing machines, with very basic math skills, I came across this book. I thought it would just introduce concepts of fuzzy logic, neural nets, and genetic programming. Pleasantly surprised that, in doing the above, the fundamental concepts are quite lucidly explained. A real mathematician would be disappointed with the lack of full proofs and mathematical rigor, but for the non- or novice mathhead, this is a wonderful find."
5,Awesome book for kids to help them understand the impact of WWII on a country and its people,"This books is wonderful. Well-written, no bad language, plenty of thrill and intrigue, and exposes your kids to another day when things weren't so great. I think we can all learn from the past, and this book does an excellent job helping our kids do just that. It will open a dialogue with them, giving you an opportunity to teach great life lessons. Plus they will learn a few things about Dutch windmills!"
3,feels cheaply made,"this is just a little cheap sign , but its made just to sit there and look pretty , so overall it serves its purpose very well."
3,Great gift for Cowboy Fans,"Good value. It was the perfect gift for a Cowboys fan. The price was good, considering the sign was thin and a little flimsy."
3,Buyer Beware,I ordered this book only to have to exchange it due to numerous printing imperfections. When I inspected the replacement book it had the same type of imperfections! The content of the book however is spectacular!
4,Great pictures,"This book is a great visual treat for anyone who likes a fun car. Fun - as is in -rare, exotic, expensive, and vintage. Ralph knows how to collect cars."
5,Dad is happy !!,"Dad wanted this book for Father's Day (so I'm early), so I had it sent directly to him. He called today, and let me know he'd received it in good order. He's hard to shop for, as he's got just about everything he wants, so I'm thrilled he's pleased with this book. I'm also glad that I've got Amazon Prime, so shipping and 2-day delivery are so predictable, so he knew when to look for the package."
5,great accuracy,"This is my first tarot deck when I bought it about 9 years ago when it was still named Renaissance Tarot and I have to say it is still my favorite deck. Personally I do not really like the style of the artwork, but somehow it seems alot more accurate in the readings compared to my other more beautifully illustrated decks. This is the one deck that I will do my really serious readings with.I have no idea what made me want to buy this deck originally but I was glad I got it. I don't do readings extremely often(like once a month or less) but I too, have seen the wear and tear on my deck and might have to get a new deck soon.Granted after reading more about tarot meanings I realised that the handbook here is a little more optimistic, but I still find it really great overall, in fact i still reference this book every now and then."
3,cute and cuddly,"This doll is really cute and cuddly. I got one for my 2 year old and my 5 year old. They both love them. They are very soft and perfect size for their little hands. I like them because it also has tons of accessories that you can purchase that go with the dolls. The dolls keeps my girls busy for hours, and are so easy to take with us wherever we go."
3,A great introduction to the Spenser novels.,"Spenser's caustic sense of humor made this book an easy read with many twists. Parker keeps you guessing as to the outcome every time. As for someone who grew up watching the ""Spenser For Hire"" Television show, this was a fun read for me. I am looking forward to reading the rest of Parker's books."
4,Modern Piracy and International Commerce,"Piracy is alive and well on the high seas of modern shipping. Specialized seaborne security forces are the Lost Command. High-capacity oil tankers travel without any military protections whatsoever. John Burnett takes us on an ocean voyage and through the Malacca Strait, carrying expensive cargoes past impoverished thieves and organized crime. The lives of the crew are worth less than ten thousand dollars, and their loved ones nothing. International responsibility needs a reevaluation."
3,Good but not great,"I found this to be less than the geopolitical analysis that I was looking for. The book was informative, but too personal to the author and his experience. Also, the subject material is focused on South Asia and the South China Sea rather than the coast of Somalia."
3,Excellent parts and boring parts,"This book is certainly enlightening as to the magnitude of the pirate problem in and around the Indian Ocean/South China Sea/Bay of Bengal. It has its good parts and is intersperced with boring parts. If you are contemplating seaborn travel in this part of the world, you *should* read this."
2,Not Too Impressed,"First off I have to say that I learned a lot more about modern piracy on the high seas than I ever knew before. This issue is something that needs to be dealt with before it becomes a thorn in the side of our world trade. I must add though, that this book is so redundant that it feels as if you are reading the same page over and over again throughout each chapter. I was not impressed and it DID NOT keep me on the edge of my seat. Bottom line here is that yes I learned something new, but my time could have been better spent with another book or learning something else."
3,"Skinlab - 'Bound,Gagged And Blindfolded' (Century Media)","Skinlab's first of three(3)albums.Although this CD simply didn't do all THAT much for me,I'll be honest and say that 'Bound...' tends to flow with sort of an atmospheric moodiness(if you would)with intense heaviness.Best cuts this disc had to offer were ""When Surface Comes To Pain"",""Race Of Hate"",""Paleface"" and ""Ten Seconds"".An okay alternative metal release,you understand just not my cup of tea.Just might appeal to fans of Fear Factory,Pro-Pain,Drain S.T.H. and possibly White Zombie."
2,Paint drying?,"This is a boring cd, although Skinlab have improved massively on their second cd,""Disembody: The New Flesh"", which is a personal favourite of mine.Catchy riffs here are a rarity, pace stays the same throughout the album, and the vox are v. monotonous. The only interesting moments here are the riff in ""Race of hate"" and the final song ""Ten Seconds"".I would recommend Skinlabs 2nd cd ""Disembody"", and their new cd ""The Revolting Room"" will shred, but skip out on this. A band does'nt deserve to make money from an album like this."
1,Caribbean Cruising: Cruising the British Virgin Islands,"I ordered this because I am planning a trip to cruise the BVI. This video is virtually worthless for gaining any insight into the BVI. It appears to have been made with a home video cam(older model at that) and by an amatuer using the video cam. Quality is terrible. It's hard to screw up the British Virgin Islands, but in this case these beautiful islands and gorgeous waters have been devastated. This video should not be offered for sale on Amazon.com at any price."
3,Al Dimeola: Cosmo Life,"Well, I either ordered this piece or never received it. However, given that it is ADM, what could possibly be bad about it?"
5,Master of his leauge,"Al DiMeola is definitely the one of the best guitar players of all time and there is no question about it. Unfortunately a lot of Americans won't even know him even though he has followers watching him here in US and buying his CDs, I believe he is much more known abroad. Al never stayed cliche with his music he explored and took chances by following his heart. This is also one of his great albums it was nice to hear his electric fusion guitar again. Comparing Al to Santana is very rediculus, Santana just an another commercial guitar player, Al is different he is a virtuoso a grand master guitar artist, and that's that. Great album educated music for people who understands high quality music."
1,"Say it ain't so, Al","I cannot imagine whatever possessed Al to appear on this CD. As a devoted DiMeola fan, I think this CD is a pure disaster. Even the 30 second intro's were painful to listen to. I guess Putin must have threatened Al's family if he did not agree to do this.Regardless, even casual DiMeola fans should avoid this CD at all cost. This is what happens when musical fusion goes off the deep end."
4,Making his dreams come true,I listened to this CD yesterday over and over...and I was amazed. When I read the notes inside the CD cover and read that music has been a passion and dream of Oscars I was impressed. I am very happy he has been able to make his dream come true by recording a CD...I hope he keeps it up. I think the quality of his voice is great and am glad he reached out to both English and Spanish audiences.
1,Oscar=Vomitorium,"Oscar De La Hoya is the worst thing to happen to the latin community since Antonio Bandereses acting career. His voice is like nails on a chlakboard and after listening to this CD my IQ fell 100 points. My dog who is clinically deaf ran from the room wimpering and brought back David Hasselhoffs hit CD ""Party On The Beach"" which I do recomend. Oscar should stick to hitting his opponents because he isn't hitting any high notes on this one. On a scale from 1-10 i rate this a knife across the throat. And if you reallly want to be entertained rent ""The Skulls"" with a breathtaking and captivating and angrified performance from the Coach himself Craig T. Nelson. Skull skull skulll skull."
2,Stick to FIGHTING...,"I'm sorry but he has no voice, there is a really good song on this album called ''With your hands'' the rest are not very good. He has so voice, he is like a Jennifer Lopez in my mind. Don't waste your money."
2,Oscar de la Hoya,"I think oscar is a talented boxer, but unfortunately he doesn't have good vocal skills. The record sounds like a bunch of studio magic and backup singers. I love oscar, but he shouldn't have recorded an album!! Stick to boxing!!!"
2,"Oscar, is he really a singer!","This album by Oscar de la Hoya brings a variety of Mexican love songs. While I felt the CD was a big hit in the US, i feel as if the same reaction won't be felt in Mexico. Oscar de la Hoya is viewed realistically as a boxer and not as a singer. But overall the Cd is decent."
4,"Oscar a champion behind the mic, too!","Like his left hook, his voice is a thing of beauty. Whether it be in English or Spanish, his soft, sext voice will put you in a trance, much like his murderous punches. He is on the verge of crossover superstardom - already one of the most wealthy boxers in the world, expect his singing career to take off.My favorite track - Ven a mi - a beautiful, upbeat song in which Oscar's vocal range is tested - most beautiful indeed."
3,An Oscar De La Hoya Fan,"This cd is an ok cd. I think that ""The Golden Boy"" sings better in spanish than in english. But overall the cd is alright."
4,Collections of essays on the English Civil War,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I thought this book did a pretty decent job in going through the entire aspect of the English Civil War from the very beginning to the Restoration of Charles II.The book is a collection of essays written by seven different authors, edited by two people. I don't expect consistancy under these conditions and expect more diverse opinions and facts relating to the matter at hand. Each essay covered certain part of the long conflict that engulfed the British Isles between 1638-1660.The book comes well armed with maps, illstrations and I thought it was quite readable. Anyone who read this book should have a decent background reading on the English Civil War prior since you will be reading an essay which don't give you much introduction space."
4,Wish the directions had been checked,"Caprial has some the best recipes out there! Her cook books directions are usually right on and the results are excellent! This cook book, like others, has recipes that are unique and are very good. There is a problem...the directions for some of the recipes are incorrect. An example is the chocolate buttermilk cake. This cake is everything it is promised to be, it just needs to be baked 10 minutes longer. I still would recommend this cook book as it has master recipes that can be modified to your own liking."
4,"Excellent recipes, lack of photos","This dessert cookbook has amazing recipes that work. The pie crust recipes are especially great because they call for butter and shortening, resulting in a tender and flaky crust that tastes great, unlike butter only recipes. The coconut cream cake and german chocolate cake are very moist and decadent. The only major problem is the lack of photos. They do have some, but I wish they had more. I will NEVER understand or agree with cookbooks that are put out and do not contain photos for the majority of the recipes. I would like to know what the end product will and should remotely look like. Also, I have tried better cookie recipes. However, because the cake and pastry recipes are so decadent, yet simple (even the more labor intensive ones are easy to follow), well structured and reliable I still highly recommend this book."
2,Dessert disasters for me........,"I unfortunately didn't look at reviews before I bought and used this cookbook. I've tried several recipes and they were disasters. I had been looking for a homemade marshmallow recipe that didn't use so much corn syrup and I was intrigued by the recipe in this book that called for a tablespoon. What a mess! It took a day of soaking my mixer bowl to clean out the goop. Now, as I read these reviews, I had the same results with biscotti and a few of the icing recipes didn't set up for me either. I may try the brownie recipe based on the reviews, but otherwise, this cookbook will go into my ""cast-off cookbook closet."""
3,Been there mostly,"Nice get-up, nice size, great pictures. Most of the recipes I have somewhere else, but it's a reasonably good resource if you're looking for tried and trues. If I had been able to look at the index, I probably would not have bought it."
2,unreadable,"I could not finish this book. The subject is fascinating but method of piecing together bits of newspaper articles, diaries and other accounts makes for cumbersome reading. This is a graduate text book, not a story."
5,A new standard,"Huntford sets a new standard in biography. If you have 30 hours left for reading, spend it with this book."
5,Skillfull research into Shackleton's background,"For those who enjoy the adventure side of polar exploration, this book will more than satisfy your desire for that part of the story. But there is, without a doubt, ""the rest of the story"" that one should know to appreciate the how and why of what came to be. Roland Huntford applies great skill in his reasearch into the background of history, British politics, family, personalities, and other forces that shaped the both the time and the man."
4,Ripping Bar,"Stanley ripping bar, one can only say""IT'S A STANLEY"" if you own and use Stanley toolsyou know what I mean."
5,I love their unique style,"I first heard theom in austin on the radio, and i fell in love with their style. They have a peculiar sound. Its not 100% tejano or norteño or grupero. They have like a mix of all three. Its kinda weird but when you listen to the cd youll understand. I bought the cd a few weeks back and i hear it everyday :)"
5,Talented!!!!,"I saw Los Gallitos at Summer fest in corpus and i just had to buy the cd. I didnt know what to expect cause they look so young, but wow, they are talented, and would you know that the cd is very very very good. seriously i was surprised. now i am a big fan! look for them on the web, there are a bunch of things out there about them!"
4,Not quite factual.,"This is a good film but sadly lacking in accuracy in some parts. My principal comment relates to the ending when the Belle crash lands. I am old enough to have seen the original movie shot on 35mm film during the war. Also I have recorded it off air on video. The Belle landed safely and with minimal battle damage. Later, after meeting the King and Queen of England, the airplane and its crew returned to USA to take part in training future bomber crews.However, I enjoyed the film and recommend it."
3,"Movie is good, but not true widescreen","I have seen this movie several times and enjoy it every time I see it. Thus I wanted my own copy.However, this DVD is listed as ""Widescreen Version"" on side B. What you get is actually letter boxed widescreen squeezed into a 4:3 format. This is not true widescreen as you have black bands all around a much smaller picture when viewed on a widescreen.I was disappointed to say the least."
5,Memphis Bell DVD,"The DVD promptly arrived after my order was placed. It was packaged well and no damage occured during shipping. DVD and cover was in new/excellent condiction. The movie was a great classic and my family all enjoyed watching it during our ""Movie Night."" The DVD was an excellent value and no tax, shipping or handling cost was added."
5,Excellent Video,This video was excellent. If you like action this video is perfect. It is insirational and exciting. It is about a B-17 in WW2 that makes it's last flight and then returns home.
4,Great,It's got some great actors and is a great movie if you like war films. I would not show this to younger kids.
4,Good Storytelling,This is a great classic true WWII story that is told and acted out very well in this production which the whole family enjoyed
