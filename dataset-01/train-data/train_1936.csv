4,Plenty of Songs; Almost All Top 20 Hits,"Good points: Twenty seven songs is a goodly number. Nine of Bobby's top 20 hits are included. There are three nice covers of Buddy Holly tunes.Bad points: Of the 27 tunes on the CD, there are only 14 that charted out of 38 total tunes that made the Billboard charts. Missing is ""Punish Her"" which peaked at #20 on Billboard's Top Pop Singles charts."
4,"Hard to Beat ""Bobby Vee"" for these oldies!","Very talented fellow, still around for various appearances, and his versions of these songs are better than anyone else's, some of which were covered by other major artists. Great writing, some are Carol King's works, and audio quality is just fine, you'll love it. I transfer the CD to an MP3 file or files and load onto my smart phone, and take this music with me. Baby boomers will remember where they were when they first heard some of these great songs, and probably whom you were with as well! Enjoy. Thanks to Bobby Vee for his great sound, iconic from this era."
2,Dude Director!,". . . like many of Zane Grey's western novels adapted for the screen, the producers and director created a comic book version of this title. They totally created a shallow version and seemed to miss the whole Dawinian aspect of Grey's writing, this is not new and is a complete misrepresentation of this iconic American writer."
4,Useful for supplementing other math curriculum.,"Instead of doing a problem a day, my daughter did a weeks worth or more in a day so we went through the book very quickly. While it is good for supplementing, it may not match up to the grade level of your main curriculum - for us it was weaker than our main curriculum, but it since the math was very simple, it did help reinforce thinking skills and we are now using the grade 3 book to supplement with which is a better match to her main curriculum."
3,Corrections to reviews,"As someone who has grown up in Oklahoma City and graduated from high school the year that the collapse had happened, I knew of some of the persons involved through other people.The red piggy bank logo belonged to Sooner Federal Savings and Loan, and sat on top of 50 Penn Place.Penn Square Bank had built what is now known as The Tower a couple of blocks down the street. They never moved into it, they were shut down while they were still inside the north end of Penn Square Mall, and the building was finished out after the closure.Singer has relatives here in Oklahoma in the oil business, so he had some insight into the things that had happened.If you want more detail, Belly Up goes into much more greater detail and is harsher in it's treatment of the characters involved."
5,Scoppettone at her best,"I'm a long time fan of Sandra Scoppettone's. I've been reading her since her Jack Early novfs (which you can get here too) and enjoying and admiring all of them. The Lauren books represent Scoppettone at her best. Here she's managed to create a serious look at like in contemporary America without all the usual tropes and cliches that accompany most similar books. The prose crackles, the characters come alive and the plot twists and dazzles. I had a great time rereading it."
1,does anyone else think this price is super-high?,This is too expensive. Buy it in the stores where you can get a single can for $2.30.
4,Easy and Delicious but way too expensive here,"The Easy Peel Sensations from Bumble Bee are super delicious! I've had the Sweet chili and the Lemon & Pepper one, and both are super convenient and tasty. The item listed gets a solid 4 stars. Great to snack on. Easy to pack for you or your kids. All around great.However....This price is way too high. At about ~$4 dollars a can ($0.82/oz * 5oz), its probably not worth it. If you go to a grocery store though this item is usually about $2.25-$2.30 a can. Much more reasonable, and definitely worth it!"
1,perfume,uy the perfume L'eau Par Kenzo by Kenzo for women. Eau De Parfum Spray 1.7 Onzasmi question is that I canceled the purchase of perfume if she is stock expect prompt response thanks
2,OH MY,"woah...Everything else SDRE did was so groundbreaking and amazing, and then this happened. the critics loved it, of course, but i didn't. it was a behemoth, and it was fast, and not romantic at all. so i threw it out, and stick with Diary and LP2.I really liked them, too!"
2,I wasn't impressed,"I consider myself a loyal SDRE fan, but this album didn't do it for me. I miss the underground feel that Lp2 and Diary projected, this album was just too above the ground for me. I also miss the unstructered, disorganized music that I loved so much. I too am sticking with repetitive play of Lp2 and Diary so I can stay a fan."
2,What exactly happened here?,"Every other release from Sunny Day Real Estate is pure genius. This, however, seems completely unfocused and corny. Jeremy's voice, which was fine on How It Feels... has gone up one octave and is very obnoxious. Also, the brilliant lyrics of the other albums, especially Diary and Lp2 have turned into some cheesy, blatently preachy Christian gobledegook. Not only has Jeremy declined, but the prog rock of How It Feels... deteriorated into U2 power chord territory most likely due to the lack of a bass player.Jeremy, William, and Nate(!) have formed a new band. I believe this band will be able to create great albums like the original Sunny Day Real Estate did. If you are new to Sunny Day Real Estate, I would get the albums is chronological order, with Diary being your first album. If you get this one first, you will judge them by their worst effort, and miss out on some great music."
4,Sweet and Haunting...,"I just listened to the whole album front to back. Beautiful....so beautiful infact that I'm here to purchase my own copy. It is as good if not better than their last album. If you are at all or ever have been a Sunny Day fan...order this record IMMEDIATLY! if you have not ever listened to Sunny day...this a good record to start with. I also Recomend ""Diary""!"
4,In same vein as last album,"Fans of SDRE's ""How it feels to be something on"" should not miss ""The Rising Tide"". In the same style as their previous effort, this album delivers emotion after gut-wrenching emotion. As always, the arrangements are tight, and leave you with something new on every listen. In particular, 'Killed by an Angel' is one of those rare songs with the ability to make you cry. I said you, not me. The only flaw is the unbearable cheesiness of some of the lyrics (Tearing of my Heart). Your appreciation of this album will surely increase once you can get past the fact that it's basically a showcase for Enigk to prove to the world how high he can sing."
4,"happy, sad, ambiguous with words","I suppose over time bands with as much talent as SDRE change, sometimes perfectly, sometimes not. This new album has moments of almost perfect harmony, a sence of beautiful polarity as usual, and of course in their own poetic style. The Rising Ride is indeed a change for SDRE, even with strings attached(no pun attended) with RAIN SONG. Although my favorite is SNIBE, played at full volume in the open air of my apartment, I suddenly realize again why Sunny Day is probably one of the most important bands out in the ever stale world of commerical music. This is a record that should be bought almost immediately without hesatation. Those interested in self reflection and interpretation of the soul should check this sublime album. Finally, buy it, listen, hit repeat, it only gets better over and over and over...."
4,interesting...,I'm very fond of this band and find that this new album stays very true to their name...I've followed them for a very long time and I LOVE this album...perfect blend of rock and just about everything else!
1,Am I the only one disappointed?,"Really, really disappointing, and this from a true-blue SDRE fan. How It Feels To Be Something On was not great but this new release is quite simply bad. Maybe I'm stuck in the past but is there anyone else out there that misses the SDRE sound of the first two CD's like I do? These new songs are boring, even tedious, and what's up with Enigk's voice? It's higher, even to the point of shrillness now."
1,the rising turd is more like it,this is the worst sunny day records. I was so let down after loving the first 3 records that now I no longer even listen to the band.
2,SDRE = devoid of emotion and songwriting skills,"Bands move on, this is true, but the new SDRE album is prettyterrible. If you like progressive rock then you'll like this, butfor fans of music then The Rising Tide is a huge disappointment. Songs involve excessive vocal effects, dull drumming and their previous emotion through music has been foresaken for mainstream ideals and acceptance. ""One"" is the only highlight - if the other songs were like this then the record could have been a classic. Unfortunately, on the basis of the other songs, SDRE should have remained broken up after their second posthumous album. By all means buy the record, but be prepared to be very underwhelmed."
2,=[,"This album was really disappointing. If you are a new sdre fan, I'd suggest you not purchase this album and go out and get diary, their best album. LP2 is also an excellent album, and so is HIFTBSO. You can see the progression from HIFTBSO to the rising tide, but in my opinion it is a decline. HIFTBSO is soft and beautiful music, especially compared to the earlier louder sdre in diary and LP2. However, in the rising tide, the music is soft, but it isn't beautiful. It is sappy, the lyrics are contrived, and the music all around just isn't so great. I can't stand most of the tracks on this cd. I used to like the ocean and rain song, but those are now unbearable to listen to. If you are a new sdre fan, go get their old stuff."
4,"Quite simply, a classic!","It would not be in the best interest of anyone to compare this album to Sunny Day's earlier works or to perseverate on its relevence to emo-culture for the simple fact that it stands alone as a classic. Unpretentious, introspective and accessible each track poetic and visceral with Jeremy's voice at the helm; a beckon of light shinning on dark shores of the subconsious. A stunningly beautiful collection of songs. This album has had a profound effect on how I view music. A must have!"
3,Sunny Day no longer sunny.,"Sunny Day Real Estate has put out some monster albums in the past - though these occured before their currently reincarnated post-pink-album-selves. Unfortunately, the new version of SDRE has never really lived up to the hype of their first two albums. First with ""How It Feels to be Something On"" and now with ""The Rising Tide."" Good songs are available on both of the new releases, but there is a noticeable lack of ""oomph"" and emotion that had characterized their first two efforts. On the new album, tracts like ""one"" and ""ocean"" and maybe the keyboard-tinged ""faces in disguise"" make up for an otherwise returnable album. The album's feel is without question a somber one, with only a few rays of sunny daylight and hope pushing through the clouds. Buy this only if you consider SDRE a major influence in the growth of your musical consciousness. Otherwise, you may be disappointed."
4,Very good,A nice change to hear a bit more texture and thickness to the overall sound of Sunny Day. Super catchy stuff on here. Check it out.
3,A Valiant Try...,"In my mind there are few bands as synonymous with the early-mid 90's as PM Dawn, that wonderfully talented and introspective duo from out east. A collection of their best material to date is a no-brainer. But this collection is only partly sucessful. Many of the big tunes you would expect are here: the wonderful 'Set Adrift on Memory Bliss', 'Paper Doll', and 'Sometimes (I miss you so much)'. My beef is not so much that some good stuff was left off, but that the remixes are completely stupid and unnecessary. I never listen to them. If I want a 'dance' album I'll buy one. But here I'd rather have 15 or so of PM Dawn's best than this hodge-podge. Check out their cd's from your local library and make your own 'best of'. Save your $."
2,Not the ...best of,I am a huge PM Dawn fan but this compilation is missing some vital songs of PM Dawn's evolution through their 4 albums. I could go into several examples but will only say..where is Hale-Bopp Regurgitations (from Dearest Christian..)This 'best of' ended up as a very one sided picture of a much more versatile band. If this is the only PM Dawn album you own (or plan to own) than do yourself a favour and buy the 4 CDs and you will discover the REAL magic of PM Dawn..far beyond what this CD portrays.
4,COOL ALBUM,I think this album is cool and make me groove. when I heared this album first I think I must buy this album.
5,The Truth About Slavery,"This book and the other collection edited by Dr. Miers ""The End of Slavery in Africa"" are required reading for anyone interested in the history of this horrible institution.Black slavery was ""invented"" by Black Africans and ""abolished"" by White Christians."
5,A feeling of the past,"This cookbook helps me to reconnect with my father who passed away in 1984, he was from Calabria Italy. He loved every ingredient in this book. I was amazed to see zucchini flowers breaded and fried. My mother and father used to make them and every kid in the neighborhood loved them, I thought my father was crazy to cook those flowers, but now that I saw them in this cookbook it makes me realize how much of his heritage was in them. This cookbook is for anyone who wants a truly authentic cookbook!"
5,Very pleased,Both of my parents came from Calabria. I was surprised and delighted to find so many recipes that my parents made. This cookbook is a treasure to me.
5,"If you are interested in Calabria, buy this book","Great book including; Calabrian history, recipes, traditions, culture. Easy reading and simple to follow recipes! Mary Amabile Palmer is a knowledgeable author."
5,Excellent Book!,"I bought Cucina Di Calabria from my mother who is from a small town in Calabria. She said it is her favorite cook book, and I have to note that she has a great collection of cookbooks. A lot of the recipes bring back memories. She has also learned different ways to make her favorite dishes and she loves the history piece. I have to admit, even though I am not a cook, I loved reading the history that went with a lot of the recipes. My cousins and I often comment that some of these recipes could be lost forever if they are not passed down. It's great to see them all in a book. We try to keep the traditions every Christmas and Easter. This is a wonderful collection of recipes that bring us memories of our heritage. Any Calabrian would really appreciate this book!"
1,Improving Organizational Effectiveness Through Broadbanding,This book provides no serious information about how broadbanding can improve organizational effectiveness. It is nothing more than a teaser for those who don't know enough about base pay compensation to ask the right questions.
5,A Hip young James Taylor,"This is a great album. Dan's voice is similar to that of James Taylor. There is a great story in every song. This is great ""hanging around the house"" music. Can't wait until a next album comes out."
5,The Baby Trap,"The best book for the childfree woman. A must read for all. It should be a requirement for all teenage girls. Rather than lots of statistics from poorly funded studies, this is a true life example and entertaining look at the reproductive choice."
5,great American stageplay,"This play, written at the height of the war in Vietnam, brings out not only different aspects of human nature but also delves into the relationships between nations, their rulers, gives insight into the mind of a leader who doesn't just go blithely to war, fairly, into the minds fo those who would enter war either out of hate or out of simply a feeling for the common defense.It was given a bravura perfomance on public television at the time by a wonderful cast headed by Richard Kiley, which is now fortunately available on dvd.With the current war in Iraq, it is timely to read or see this play again. It is very thoughtfully crafted in all aspects."
3,eh,"Well, I initally learned of this drama when I auditioned for a show and we read from it -- and I immediately loved the Queen Mother. After having that taste I purchased it -- but was sadly disappointed. Far from being awful it is obvious why this drama received no rave reviews -- its slow and though we meet characters we never really know them -- though its slow there is too much happening for such a short time -- in short, the work was poorly developed."
1,"Not an easy read, too much information thrown in...",Was expecting a great book about MRP II but just didn't cut out to be on just MRP II. Too much other information were placed there that should have belonged to another chapter. Quite confusing with all the acronyms that were randomly placed in the text. This book assumes that you have read other MRP II books. Definitely not a primer on MRP II.
3,"Very cute, but.....","Priscilla is an adorable character. The story also just as cute, there is a whole lot of Dr. Seuss influence! However, (to me)the rhymes just do not flow very well. I have read this book several times to my daughter and it is always the same thing. But over all it is a fun story."
5,Wonderful Story!,"I purchased this book for my daughters first birthday a few weeks ago. We read it tonight for the first time, my 2 1/2 yr old son even wanted to read it. It was sooooo cute! Love the story and the pictures. Its a really easy read, but its a long story so it made it worth the money. I get tired of paying for books that are so short, you are done reading them in 2 minutes. But I enjoyed the rhyming. Already cant wait to read this one again and purchase the other Priscilla books!"
4,Cute book for a Pink Loving Girl,My four-year-old daughter loves this book. The rhymes are well done with only one or two rough spots. The illustration is great and it gives enough pink to satisfy my daughter and yet teaches her that other colors have their place too.
2,Not great,"I bought this book for my 3yo bc the reviews seemed pretty positive and she LOVES pink. I knew it would be written in verse but it is sooo long it's hard to get through. About halfway through, my 3 yo kept asking me, ""mom, can i go now?"" She did want to wait and see what happened to the butterfly though, so we just stopped reading the text and talked about what was happening. She may be a little young for it, but she is very good at following long stories, this one just did not hold her attention."
4,Pink Planet,My four year old granddaughter loves the color pink. She also loves this book and asks for it to be frequently read to her.
4,To Bad this isn't available,This is a fantastic album. Fripp indulges heavily in Frippertronics while Toyah tells the classic Stockton tale in her languid and saucy manner. For years I used this album to fall asleep. Very mellow and entertaining.I hope the CD comes back into issuance.
3,"Strong kick on the flavor, doesn't seem to be good on sandwiches","This honey dijon seems to have a really strong kick to the flavor. Maybe it is better for dipping, I used it in ham and cheese sandwiches on multi-grain bread and it doesn't really taste that good in that combination. It's definitely not bad either. I'm still looking for a good sandwich honey mustard."
3,Eric Carle books,The art work is beautiful as in all of Eric Carle's books but the content in this one was over the head of my first grader.It is actually more a collection of poetry about mythical animals than a children's book. I do not recommend it for small children.
1,If only the sound was as good as the album,"This is the original CD release--and it's terrible. ""Star Star"" is the uncensored version (unlike the 2009 remastered version), but by the time you reach it at the end of the CD, your ears are ringing. It's the kind of CD sound that makes people keep their turntables: peaky highs, a dessicated midrange, and flabby bass.""Goats Head Soup"" is actually a good album. CD mastering has improved a lot since 1990. Be kind to your ears, and opt instead for the 1994 Virgin release, the import, or the 2005 version."
4,"Rolling Stones Goats Head Soup, original CD release","One of my favorite Stones albums. The original CD mix sounds good in my opinion. I had all these original Stones releases before the 94 Virgin remasters ever came out so this was what I was used to them sounding like. I be interested to hear from people that have compared the 3 versions of this CD (This original release, the 94 remaster & the 09 remaster)."
1,Only a beginner's overview--looks like a promotional CD,"This CD is not worth the cost. Even if you are the beginner investor, you should expend the effort to read the Lynch books. The CD adds nothing to the experience.The data download with the program over the Internet is not up-to-date. A month after a company announced earnings, it was not reflected in the software download.Too bad. I'd hoped the interactive nature of the potential medium would have provided a more sophisticated review and input. Not to be."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this one with ""A New Beginning I"" and it was basically the same exact book. I was disappointed."
3,"A good, not great introduction. . .less helpful than vol. 1","This is the second volume to Gonzalez' ""History of Christian Thought"". Like the first, it is a good resource for college undergraduates and the informed layman. It is not a good choice for graduate level or seminary studies.I was a little disappointed in this volume. It covers a time period almost twice as long as the first volume, but is of the same length. Thus, important material is covered in lesser depth than might be desired, especially considering the great theologians of this time: Augustine, Abelard, Bernard, Bonaventure, Scotus, and especially Aquinas.A decent, but not great, secondary source."
4,Shipping time,"I asked to have it expedited and it took five days. That, in my opinion is not fast, at all. If I would have known that it was going to take that long, I would have opted for ground. It would have been cheaper and probably would have arrived in about the same period of time."
1,Still waiting for the book to arrive.,The shipper of this book is too slow in shipping my purchase. I ordered it over a month ago and I have not received it as of this posting.
4,"Great book, fun and an easy read.","Fun book if you want to not only learn the art of Japaneese long bow, but the history as well."
4,A good book,"I don't know if this book is out-of-print but it was published in the 1990s as a $32 book. So, buyers, you may wish to look elsewhere. I paid $100 and, though I liked the book, I felt I paid too much.Moving on to the actual book review:This book does a very nice job of explaining Kyudo and it's various steps. It won't teach you Kyudo -- you need a teacher for that -- but it will help you to make sense of the details. The writing is clear and helpful, and it addresses a lot of questions about equipment, tradition and technique. It only makes a few, undetailed references to Kyudo-based ceremonies."
2,Discrete,Not a great recording from a technicl point of view.Interesting the conduction of C. Munch but I expected something more beautiful...
1,lame,"A mediocre book with large stickers you are suppose to put over the little symbols. Stickers are mostly too large to fit in the space, so they end up covering the words. Don't waste your money on this."
5,How to Make One Hell of a Profit and Still Get to Heaven,"I really love this book. I have just gotten through the first chapter, but it makes me stop every 2-3 pages and pause and think. I am really seeing the things that I need to change in my life to step into my abundance. Thank you for taking the time to put this down in this book. Namaste!"
1,Used Goods?,"This ""new"" item looks as if it has been used. Cord is scuffed up and GFCI piece has residue on it."
2,Disappointed,"I have just received this product, and I was very disappointed. The product is listed as a 12/3 corded GFCI. The problem is that the current rating was not listed in the online description. The current rating on this product is 15 Amps. Most individuals in the trades know that a 12/3 cord usually rerers to a 20 Amp rating or device."
5,As advertised,Nice heavy duty cable. Bought it as a back 'breaker' for the submersible pump I use when my backyard floods every spring.
3,Not bad,"OK, this is not a bad version of Move It, but it hardly rates as a duet. Neither does Throw Down A Line. In fact, there is precious little harmonising in any of the songs. Cliff sings and then the 'friend' sings. Contrary to the above review, Brian Bennett was not the original Shadows drummer. That was Tony Meehan.Overall, this is a pleasant album, but I don't know if it's worth the price of admission for the six new duets. Cliff sings well, but his fairly recent albums ""Real As I Wanna Be"" and ""Something's Goin' On"" are much more enjoyable and entertaining."
4,Duets done properly,"Cliff Richard may not have the following here that he does in England, but he has worked with some of the best. On this disc you get Olivia Newton-John, Phil Everly, Barry Gibb, Sarah Brightman and many more talented singers. Some of the tunes date back to the 1970s, but if you haven't collected his albums, you'll want this CD for its hits and shoulda-been hits."
3,Hit and Miss,"While a few of these duets are quite wonderful (Slow Rivers, She Means Nothing to Me, Move It, and Danny Boy), the rest of this disk consists of overly tired ""chestnuts"" (Suddenly, Anyone Who Had a Heart, and All I Ask of You) and--dare I say it--schmaltzy drivel (Up Where We Belong and Reunited). Now I like Anne Murray and Lulu as much as the next middle-of-the-road music listener, however, these arrangements belong on a 1970s variety show. If you can get this CD for about $5.00 like I did, go for it. Otherwise, you're not missing much."
4,Fun and Fresh!,"Eleventyseven's first cd followed a very stereotypical approach to the punk rock Christian market and I had mixed feelings. Galactic conquest is a 180 degree turn and, for the most part, for the better. The computer generated riffs, sounds, and digitized voices are goofy and fun and the lyrics are moderately decent (considering most ""Christian"" rock). Worth the money for sure."
3,Needed more character development.,"Maybe I've just hit my limit of the anti-hero, and I freely state that I need to feel an affinity to the characters to really like a book. I know others have really liked this book, but I found myself reading to get to the end, particularly as you know, fairly early on, who is the killer. In fact, I felt more emphasis was spent building his characters than the protagonist. On the plus, it is well written and suspenseful, but I'm going back to books where there are protagonists I like and maybe even have qualities I can admire."
4,Sturdy Debut,"I enjoyed Steven Sidor's first novel, Skin River. He sets a tale of a very damaged man who takes out his revenge on the world by murdering and dismembering young women.Our hero has a checkered, organized-Chicago-crime past, and he's trying to exorcise his ghosts by making an honest living in the small town Midwest and letting time heal his psychological wounds.He grudgingly must take up arms again as his past confronts him in his hometown, and he manages to find out who's behind the killings in his small town. Sidor does not overwrite, and his brevity makes reading his novel a pleasure. His style is thoughtful and somber, without being too heavy or taking itself too seriously. Mr. Sidor is a welcome new edition to the genre, and I look forward to his next work."
2,You've heard this before,"I just saw this movie, and yes, I am a little late. But overall, I wasn't impressed. I feel like I've heard all this before and the movie didn't add much to my knowledge about the difficulties of living in Iraq post war. Of course life is hard there and people are being killed. One scene shows women talking about the Americans shooting outside of the mosque and coming into the women's prayer area. I feel their pain as I watch, but overall I found the movie to be a bit disjointed. You get brief scenes of American military making plans for the election process, scenes of UN election supervisors, and you follow a doctor/candidate throughout his country. There is no narration. The movie just keeps flipping from one scene to another. If a person doesn't know much about the war or war's effects on people, perhaps this is worthwhile. For me, it didn't add to my knowledge of the true face of the war."
4,very good cables!,"for the price and the quality, these cables are the way to go! I have tried G'Ls, and other misc brands, and i never had that good of results, especially for what i was paying.the only downfall to these cables are the fact that they are so big and bulky. you wouldn't be able to use a looper pedal (a signal saver looper pedal, like what roadrage makes) just because you will have way too much cabling in one spot.But i would still highly recommend these cables, i own 2 sets of them, and i think that they are great!"
2,What is this film about?,"A guy in a fright mask apparently thinks that he is Jesus,or maybe Lucifer,or maybe both at the same time...He talks to angels,or are they demons?He crucifys some girls in the woods,or does he?The dialouge for this film is mainly religious-inspired gibberish...When the lunatic main charecter is not talking to himself,or to the demons/angels,or to a potential victim there are some VERY bad rock songs played...The blurb on the dvd box says something about an LSD trip gone bad,and about not letting yourself be tied up,but there is no evidence that anyone let themselves be tied up,and maybe the film-maker was actually on LSD when he made this film..in any event the film is incoherent..."
4,extensive book on oxygen therapies,"This is the most extensive and detailed book I have read about oxygen therapies. All types of therapies, oxygen peroxide applications, the use of ozonation for air and water, some commercial available products with formulas that include oxygen, all are extensively explained in this book of around 600 pages, which I consider a reference on this subject.On the minus side, most of the commercial products analysed are sold by a web site somehow related to the author of this book. There are many other products on the market, and it would be good that some of them were also referred in this book."
4,flooded with oxygen,I had first read hydrogen peroxide medical miricle which started me on H2O2.Amazing. Then McCabes book served as a follow up for me. McCabes information led me to add oxygenated water to my regimen.( I bought my own oxygen generator) Further and resounding sucsess!
4,natural remedies,"I wish I had found this years ago,when my husband was first diagnosed with Leukemia. Knowing what I now know,I believe, more than ever, that doctors need to be educated about more natural-less lethal methods-chemo does so much damage-the damage from the chemo is what caused my husband's untimely death,at an early age, and caused unnecessary and devastating health problems for years. My campaign to vindicate his death,will be to educate people and doctors about the horrors of chemo=while many people survive the effects of chemo,there are an equal, if not greater number who do not. There needs to be an outcry against such therapies-and an insistence that newer, less toxic remedies be implemented. These treatments are inhumane,and usually ""pushed"" on patients and their families as the ""only solution"" to treating an aray of frightening diseases."
4,Oxygen Heals.,I have chewed through about 3/4 of this book so far. Ed McCabe shares a lot of his own life story around the use of oxygen as therapy. There is also a great deal of useful information but it is not very easy to sort out. All in all it was still worth the money and would be helpful in selecting a course of oxygen therapy.
5,Flood Your Body With Oxygen,"I love this book. It is truly the bible of oxygen therapy and benefits. One thing I am grateful for is the reference to a product mentioned on page 168 of this book. It saved my life, and immediately helped a number of friends and family members as well. The book is impeccably researched and indexed. It is the best book of its type that I've seen. I would advise anyone who is interested in this subject to start with this book."
3,Means well...,"I totally agree that H2O2 can clean-up the human body, the food we eat, our households, everything kept in it and keep pools clean and safe. The problem with this book is that 50% of it talks about the use of special machines which the author says can be used to clean the blood in our veins. Sounds a bit dangerous. But to each his own. My complaint is that I only found half of the information in this thick book helpful.The other 50% is like an INFOMERCIAL for various products. Feels like I was listening to a salesman's pitch.After reading it and taking notes, I sold it."
1,I still have some left over bottles. It's not good.,It's very important to know that the Oxygen is a good idea but it doesn't do anything in the end unfortunately.
2,not quite there,"This is a wonderful idea, but the book is so complicated and chock full of information that it's hard to understand exactly what he's advocating. He needs to chop it down to an understandable concise packet so the information is actually useable. I know he wants to explain the ""whats"" and ""whys"" and that's good, but if you can't get any useable information out of it, why read it?"
2,Annoying,"Been trying to find some practical information in here, like what kind of oxygen bar to get, how to use the various therapies and simple comparisons and ratings of the therapies-impossible! The book is totally disorganized so forget about quick referencing or finding any specific information. A lot of the info is interesting, but I don't have time to read all 550 pages from cover to cover just to glean a few pieces of essential information, which appear not to be included anyway."
5,Great book,Great information about this crucial element called oxygen. It might just change you life.Thanks Ed McCabe.
3,Flood Your Body with Oxygen is OK,"Flood Your Body with Oxygen is OK, a bit too technical for me to want to read, but there is some interesting information in it."
4,Great Reading!!,"Having been saved from ill health by ""Oxygen Therapies"", I read Ed McCabes new book. Really good reading. Suggest it to all those seeking a healthy life and lifestyle. Keep up the good work Ed!"
2,I thought it was a lot of hype,"To me, anyway, not much practical useful info, more like a lot of hype than anything else. Also needs updating, some of the products he touts don't even have the same names anymore.I'll probably donate the book to Goodwill."
3,"Partially useful, partially fluff","The author is definitely not as witty as, say, Grady Booch or Steve McConnell and the book is not as glamorous as theirs. To be fair, it does not provide the same insight into the software development process, either. However, I did use a couple of suggestions from this book. In particular, I used the layout of the Technical Proposal and the cost estimation formulas, which is more than I can say of most books I have read on the subject (e.g., Object Solutions : Managing the Object-Oriented Project, which is nevertheless much more interesting). Not the ultimate book on project management, but the author does not claim he found the much-coveted silver bullet."
1,Very boring. No practical uses.,"I was forced to buy this book for college course work. I found it boring, and I spent a lot of time trying to read the small print."
4,These are characters you won't soon forget,"As 1. a New Englander and 2. the child of parents who lived through most of the period described in Myrer's Green Desire I loved this book. Two brothers, one defined by the old-school and who-you-know and the other by an unconquerable work ethic, tangle in a web spun by the dazzling daughter of a Portuguese fisherman's family. It is contemporary drama meeting the Great Depression head on. These are characters you won't soon forget."
2,I'm a little ashamed of myself,"I did something this morning no self respecting book lover should do. After investing myself into 1/4 of this book, I just gave up waiting for more. I turned to the back and read the last 15 pages just to get it over with. Thank god."
1,Attempted Classic,"This book is divided, almost arbitrarily into four sections- Hook, Pitch, Clincher, Close. A major theme is selling, and so one comes to wonder what the book is trying to sell you on. Characters that are supposed to be endearingly innocent turn out to simply have no character development at all; a repetative and frustrating read."
4,MUST SEASON FIRST!!!!,"I haven't been able to use all the accessories of this wok but so far it works great! I would give it 5 stars, but it doesn't come with directions. Lack of directions is most likely why the other reviewers had problems, they most likely didn't season the wok first. Just type in ""season wok"" in your favorite search engine and pick a technique that works for you. Its basically just like seasoning a cast iron skillet and I think the care is the same too. My husband and I seasoned our wok, got a nice smooth carbon coat, wiped off the extra gunk, rinsed with water and just started cooking. The food came out great and cooked in no time! I'm really excited to keep using it and getting it seasoned really well!"
1,Upset consumer,My husband and I purchased the Kitchen Wok 101 and ate with our food whatever peeled off the wok when I cooked with it. We are very disturbed and disgusted at how something like this can stay on the market. I really don't want to give this any star but 1 star is the lowest. Believe me it deserves no stars!!
1,This is not Graham Greene,This book is classified wrongly. It is not Graham Greene so dont buy it by mistake as I did. It is rubbish.
3,Good bargain monitor - not for critical or intense use,"If you will use this monitor for many hours per day or you need a monitor that will have an excellent color rendition, then you may wish to look elsewhere. Text is not pin-prick sharp - certainly compared to my other LCD screen (Sharp 19"") and colours are not even across the screen.HOWEVER, for occassional, non-critical use, I find this monitor to be a GOOD choice blending very good value with good looks and acceptable performance.Would I buy another one just like it? Probably not - but I am not unhappy with having bought it."
3,Better du Maurier Short Story Collections Out There,"This is a collection of eight short stories by Daphne du Maurier. I'd only recommend it to someone who really enjoys her writing and wants to read all of her work. Otherwise, a much better collection of short stories is Kiss Me Again, Stranger (also called The Apple Tree or The Birds - her short story collections tend to have a few different names).Of the 8 stories, Blue Lenses is a great psychological/sci-fi tale. The Alibi and The Archduchess are worth reading. The rest are fairly forgettable."
5,Loving it!!,"This album seems to be on repeat in my player. Every song fits the perfect mood, her voice, and the the guitars are so beautiful. From the first track (""White Flag) that sets the tone, to a more moody ""Evolve,"" to ""Time has Come (my favorite),"" each track offers something different and really highlights their range. Leaves me wanting more! I'd recommend this to anyone, its about time something like this came out. Her ethereal voice, and tangible lyrics make me just want to sing along...(sorry neighbors).This is a must buy for anyone, you'll see why! Can't wait for a follow up album or a tour!"
2,Not big enough,The camera cover is new and arrived fast BUT as far as I know it is not big enough for any DSLR camera in the market which means it is a total waste of money for what I needed.The seller should add in the item discription that it WILL NOT fit most cameras so people like me will not get dissapointed!!!
2,Strap hook broke off on the first day,"hook broke off on the first day, noted they are plastic hooks, would you trust your $1000 camera with some thin plastic hooks? I had to return it."
1,I'm sorry I didn't pay attention to other reviewers!,You'll spot other reviews decrying the zipper on this case. That's because the zipper on this case renders it useless -- as in -- zipper simply won't open right out of the box. Period. Seems like a nicely made product otherwise -- but I can't attest to the inside of it. Since I can't get it open. Because of the zipper.Best course of action here: Avoid purchase.
5,good quality and price,fits my rebel nicely. still compact enough to carry around. solid enough to protect camera. Has a pocket to hold extra SD cards.
4,Just right,"For the price, this basic camera case fills the need for anyone needing protection for their camera or other device. I purchased it for that reason, but anyone needing to carry lots of accessories along with the camera should seek alternatives. It is well constructed with enough padding and structure to take most abuse cameras may expect to see in any but the most demanding situations."
3,everything ok but the zipper and camera strap,"I just need a camera bag, that's all. I can put my canon rebel xs into the bag without problem. But there is no comfortable place to put my camera wide strap. You can squeeze it in the bag, but you might worry a little bit about scratching the camera screen. Besides, the zipper seems very cheaply made."
4,Better portability!,"I have a DSLR camera but its case is a ""little"" oversized! This one is really functional and portable but doesn't fit much besides the camera itself!"
3,"Good concept, zipper issues","This case is a very good idea, and works pretty well. However, most of the time the zipper can't handle the contours of the case. It gets stuck almost every time the case is opened. I like the case, but I'm not sure how much longer the zipper will last with me having to yank on it every time I open the case."
2,Too small for standard SLR with standard zoom lens,"I was pretty excited about getting a SLR camera case for less than $20. When the case arrive the quality good but I was sorely disappointed when my Nikon D80 plus my 30-105mm zoom lens (a pretty standard package) could not fit into the case. I guess it could have fit with a 50mm fixed lens but I think it is pretty rare these days to have a SLR for regular use without some sort of zoom.If you use a zoom lens and have a standard size SLR it will not fit and therefore, do not waste your time or money on this otherwise acceptable product."
2,broken,"I bought this product after reading MULTIPLE reviews for my Canon Rebel XSI. Though the camera itself fits great, it came with the strap broken (the swivel where it attaches to the bag). I was leaving for a few months and didn't want to pay for shipping back, and then wait to receive it. Additionally, the zipper already in <1mo gets off track when I try to close the case. Though I'm sure it's great if you got a good piece, my case is definitely not worth it!"
5,great value,"This case should last a long time. It seems well made and fits my Nikon d40 with the 18-22mm lens perfectly. I do not currently have any extra lenses so this fits my needs well at this time. I would recommend this product. It has a compartment inside for memory cards and/or your usb cord and can be worn using the shoulder strap or it could be buckled to a belt. There is also a sturdy strap on the top of the case to just ""grab n go"". Great buy."
5,New camera case,I recieved my new camera case and am very pleased with the whole purchase. It will fit my Nikon D40 with either of my current zoom lenses perfectly and at a reasonable price.
4,Just big enough and a good value.,"I got exactly what I was expecting with this case. It is just big enough to hold my Canon Rebel XSi with the kit lens attached, with a few SD cards stuck in the internal webbing. The padding is sufficient to protect the camera while you're carrying it around, or while it's stuffed into another backpack. Just don't expect it to protect your camera if you drop it on the ground!One note: since I was mostly carrying it in my backpack I removed the included strap and just used the Canon strap on my camera to save clutter in my bag.Overall a great value for the money, and fast shipping to boot."
5,Does the job...,Good item. I got exactly what I wanted. A case to protect my camera. I have a Sony a200 and it fits perfectly.
1,Does not fit either of my relatively small slr's,"This product is too small. Neither my Nikon F100 nor my Canon T2i fit. In ""case"" you were wondering (see what I did there?) neither camera had the optional battery grips on them when I tried.I would have giving it a neutral 3 stars, but the zipper was very cheap.Great price, sub-par product"
3,Good Product. Does not fit Nikon D90,"Good Product. Does not fit Nikon D90Quality is good, zip is also good. I am not able to keep the Nikon D90 camera with cap and neck band. Too tight to place it. I have a filter in front of the lens which may be the reason for not fitting properly. But most of us uses filter in front of lens to avoid damage.D90 wont fit."
2,Measure Carefully,"I recently purchased the ""Opteka SLR & DSLR Camera Short Zoom Holster Case w/Adjustable Shoulder Strap"" to house my Canon 40D (with 28-135 mm lens) for an up coming trip abroad. The holster arrived promptly, to my discovery that it is fractionally too short for my camera.Re-measuring the 40D, with lens, and the Opteka holster revealed that the manufacturer touts its SRL & DSLR case with, apparently, exterior measurements. The camera's external dimensions wont fit inside the case!I liked the low price, thick padding, long strap, quick function zipper, handy extra pocket, and black color of this Opteka holster. It is certainly recommended for cameras, with lenses smaller than 7.5"" L by 6.5"" D by 4.5"" H. The ""Exterior Dimensions: 7 3/4"" L x 4 1/4"" D x 7 1/2""H"" posted @ Amazon are misleading. (This Opteka holster is smaller than this on the inside. It needs to be, at least, another .5"" longer.)I returned it requesting a refund."
4,"Cheap, small and nice looking, but first make sure your camera fits","I bought this bag for my Canon 450D with Canon EFS 17-85mm lens and I tell you the camera barely fits in this bag. If my lens was a little larger, I'd have to return the bag. The bag is small and very nice (and cheap). You can't put anything else in the bag beside the camera really. The shoulder strap is just cheap. Overall it's a good product for the price. The only thing I worry about is the zipper. It's cheap (how predictable!) so it might not work for much long. I had some trouble with the zipper trying to fit my camera in the first time. It needs some care."
3,nice size for travel,"For the price, it is worth it. The only bad thing about it is the zipper comes apart sometimes and the metal or plastic that the zipper is made of feels cheap (probably because it is). I would recommend this to anyone who just wants a basic cheap case for their camera."
2,Kind of cheap,"I only paid $9.95 for this product but thats no excuse for its low quality. The first time I tried to put my camera into it, Canon Rebel XT, the zipper popped. With a little effort I got the zipper back into place, but still come on. The camera fits in quite well, but there is really no room to store anything else in the case besides a memory card or something very small. What can you expect for $10 I suppose.The other bad part was the proportionately high shipping costs, an additional $7.95 for shipping through this seller made it roughly a $20 purchase. Not really product related I guess."
4,good fit,It fits my Canon Digital Rebel XTi with its lens perfectly. Well padded. Convenient adjustable shoulder strap.
2,Internal dimensions are wrong,"This is actually a pretty nice case for a ridiculous low price. It didn't work for me because the internal dimensions listed are WRONG! use 6 X 4 X 6.5 as a more accurate guide. My D7000 with an 18-200 lens, two filters and front cap measures 7 inches. It was a major struggle getting the case closed. You really can't fit in anything longer than 6.5 inches. Beware!"
1,Bad zipper quality,"It's like everybody says; The zipper is terrible quality. Other than that, it works OK."
3,You get what you pay for,"First point is this product is cheap. It fits my Nikon D5000 well with it's standard lens. The case is plastic and it looks and feels like plastic but that's ok.the issue I had with the producted was a defective zipper. You would close the zip but it would burst open, not because of being under stress. It maybe I just had a bad one with poor quality control but I wouldn't recommend buying this product."
2,bulky,"This case does what it is intended to do. The only problem is the portability. The carrying strap that is included feels as if you've tied a shoelace to it and after hiking with it for a while, leaves you a little chapped."
2,"Nice Sleek Compact SLR Case, but Zipper Problem","Fits great for my Canon Rebel xsi with the standard lens.I bought this for the more compact shape than most SLR bags. But it doesn't accommodate zoom lenses at all.Has a pouch for extra memory and battery.BUT, the zipper is garbage--at least on mine. If you zip one direction it will come completely apart. Zipping the other way it holds together. I just have to remember to zip the right way. I suppose I could have exchanged, but for only $10 I figured it would be too much trouble.On that note, this things is a great value if it had a better zipper. Everything else about it I like."
4,"Functional, but not too stylish","This is a great value product. I wanted something that would protect my camera as I bounced around in my backpack because I had recently decided to carry my SLR around with me everyday to document my last semester of college. This camera bag is nice to carry by itself sometimes as well because it is so small and compact, but on the downside, everyone will know that you are carrying an expensive dslr. My other complaint is that the bag barely fits my Canon 40D with the Tamron 17-50mm f2.8 lens. It fits, but its quite snug."
3,little tight for my D3100,My D3100 just squeezes in with its strap but it fits in tight and is secure inside. They do have pockets inside but the best you can stuff is a short USB wire and a couple of memory cards. The battery charger can no way fit inside. The outside pocket has little practical use. Leather quality is good
1,You get what you pay for,"We decided to buy this camera case because it was cheap, and we wanted something to hold our new digital SLR until we could check around for something else. This thing is cheapy made. The zipper doesn't always zip properly on the first try. I wouldn't recommended it."
3,Just too small of D90 with 18-105mm lens,This bag is actually too small to fit a Nikon D90 with 18-105mm lens. It is able to fit inside but is very tight to zip close (and zipper is not great quality). It could work well for a slightly smaller camera / lens combo though.
4,So far so good...,"Seems good so far. Fits my canon Rebel XS with a 18-200mm lens attached, with a little room for an extra battery/memory cards. Does what I need it to do. Zipper does seem flismy, as others have stated, but I haven't had any problems yet. Great for the price."
2,Not for Nikons,"This is a overly small case. I wouldn't trust the measurements to translate to the actual inside area. I purchased this and a Lowepro case. Without question, in my opinion, the Lowepro is a superior product."
2,There is a reason it's only selling for $15,"I can't believe that this bag was ever really sold for $50, at least not with the current zipper. I knew I was buying a cheaper bag so I wasn't expecting much. While the padding and the general make of the bag is nice the zipper is TERRIBLE. The teeth are constantly mismatching and even coming undone. Also, even though the bag seems trim it doesn't fit into other things (like a diaper bag) very well. I finally ran across a Tamrac bag at a second hand store for $2. I moved my digital SLR AND an extra lens in along with extra battery and charger and yet that bag takes up less room than this Opteka one. I'd spend the extra money next time to get the better bag. Not to mention that the Tamrac zippers feel like they are never going to wear out. Tamrac bag is similar but not the same as this one:Tamrac 5501 Explorer 1 Camera Bag (Black)"
3,Handy but low quality,"Purchased it for my EOS 450D. Handy, my carema fits great, but such a low quality zip. Practically broke on the second day...if I had to choose again I would spend some more money on a better quality product."
2,Find a different bag,"This bag has a terrible zipper. I started having problems with the zipper on the send use.Later, I bought similar size pouch bag from Tamrac, which just a bit more expensive ($24 vs. $15), but much better."
4,It works for my camera!,"I have a new Pentax SLR digital camera, and this case fits it well. It seems sturdy and well made, and it's quite a bargain for the price, too. I bought it through Amazon."
1,Good Quality but not useful,"I bought this holster as a carrying case but the fact is the camera barely fit in it. The description said that is for a slr camera with mid range lens but the in and out movements is difficult, caused by the camera strap. The quality is good but for me was a waste of money."
3,Opteka SLR & DSLR Camera Short Zoom Holster Case w/Adjustable Shoulder Strap,"Very prompt shipping. However, it was not very useful. It will not allow anything else apart from the camera"
2,Not great,"I purchased this originally for my Nikon D5100, although it fit right in, it fit inside it a little 'too snug', sometimes finding it difficult to zipper all the way around with the regular zoom lens. I had to leave out the camera strap so that it would fit and this was inconvenient for me because I had to leave the camera somewhat exposed. This is good for a back-up only."
2,Very basic quality,"Guess my expectation was higher. But...* The art leather quality is very basic and doesnt give the ""Pro"" look* Finishing of stich is not quite good* The plastic quality is very poor. The buckle for the shoulder strap broke from normal use (using with nimble hands!)You are better off purchasing a different brand/model for a holster case."
5,Perfect fit!,"This item fits my Canon Rebel T3 with the EF-S 18-55mm IS II Lens mounted with a little room to spare for extra batteries, cards etc. it appears well made and is much more convenient that lugging around the larger camera bag on our upcoming trip. The price is great as well."
3,Best for the price with one significant issue...,"After dropping more money than I'd like to admit on a D-SLR, a $20 carrying case seemed like the right choice for us.We aren't serious photographers, so we don't need to carry a bunch of extra doo-dads other than a lens cloth and our remote release.This carrying case works perfectly for our needs as we only have a zoom lens up to 80mm borrowed from my old Rebel EOS film camera.The ONE significant draw back is this: the zippers. Not saying they are faulty, but I'll guess 100% of D-SLR owners attach the neck strap to their camera. Once the camera is in the bag, there is no easy way to close the bag around the camera's strap.I'm wary about trying to shove the camera's strap inside on top of the viewing screen as the only other clear alternative.That issue aside, it's a decent case for simply protecting your camera."
5,GREAT!!!!!,"This is the best thing we bought for our camera, it was actually what it said it was when we got it. Will re order from this company again."
3,Missing slots for camera's straps,"Nice bag for the price, but would be much better if the cover could be closed while keeping the camera's own straps outside. As it is, you have to fold the camera's strap and tuck it in prior to zipping the case cover, which is a bit of a hassle.Also, a velcro fastener for the cover flap in addition to the zipper would be good for frequent camera removals and stowage during a photo session."
3,Camera didn't fit as internal measurements posted are incorrect.,"Nice bag but the internal dimensions are not accurate. My Canon 50D with 18-200 lens was too big even though it measures 7"" long (which is what the internal dimension was listed as) but it needed another 2"" to fit. I ordered the larger version (Opteka long zoom holster case)and hope this one will fit as its supposed to be 9"" long. I will use the other one for my digital rebel which fits perfectly."
3,Good,It was good for camera with standard 18-55 mm lens but not for any other lens. So I had to return it.
1,Zipper splits instantly,I purchased this case as a gift for my mom and was so embarassed as the zipper split as soon as she tried to close it. I am in the process of trying to get a refund.
4,Small but sturdy,"This bag is sturdy, but it can (as other people have noted) only hold a camera body plus small lens with hood or medium lens without hood. Currently I can fit my Canon 40D with 50mm and have plenty of room leftover."
4,handy,"although this is truly only big enough for the actual camera with no accessories, i throw this in my big purse when i don't want to carry a regular camera bag, but think i may want to take some shots. it will protect the camera from scratches, etc, but probably not from serious impact. worth $10, probably not much more, but nice to have as an option."
5,Nice bag for Canon digital Rebel,"My Canon digital Rebel fits in this case nicely. Not much extra room, though. Perfect as a minimal camera bag when you don't really care to carry around anything larger. Nice quality but thin material."
1,If you have a NIKON D100 or similar do not buy!,This holster absolutely would not fit my NIKON D100...i should have read the other reviews...i am sending it back to the seller.
3,does it attach to the tripod screw?,I'm looking for a case that you can flip off to take pictures such that it can then hang from the camera because it's still connected via the tripod screw. One less thing to carry around and lose. Does anyone know if this case is like that?Thanks!Dave
2,TOO SMALL FOR CANON T3 WITH 18-55MM LENS,This holster case is too short for the Canon T3 with an 18-55mm zoom lens. I will order the larger Canon holster bag instead.
5,Perfect for what I need it for,"I bought this holster to hold my Nikon D3100 for those times I don't need to carry my big camera bag with me with all of my extra equipment. I can throw this in my purse or the diaper bag and go. It is very well made and looks nice. I love the grab handle at the top (I haven't attached the messenger strap, I like to carry it by the handle). The front mesh pocket is nice to place the lens cap so you don't lose it. The inside mesh pocket (on the inside of the top flap) is nice for a cleansing cloth or filters. I can easily fit the camera with the lens kit lens and there's enough room to fold the neck strap and place it on top and have the case close so the neck strap isn't hanging out of the case. Very happy with this. It surely won't replace my regular ""camera bag""' but it's fine if you want to use it in another bag and have your camera safe and secure."
3,You get what you pay for.,"First, let me just say that I like well constructed luggage/carry cases/etc. This does not fit the bill. This looks and feels cheap, and it is. Im sure its perfectly adequate for storing your camera for a plane trip, but you might be better off just wrapping the camera in a tee-shirt.Its a a throw-away item and no one who is serious about transporting their camera safely would consider this bag adequate. Buy it if you never travel and need something to take on a one time trip, but for no other reason. Returning the item."
2,Too short,"The camera case is OK, but it is not as spacious as advertised. I can barely close it when I put in my Nikon D3100 with a small 18-55mm lens"
2,Good value but.....,"It was designed too small for a Canon Rebel 300 with a short lens and shoulder strap. The camera and lens will barely fit in the case without the camera strap. (Even if the camera strap were removed, the strain on the nylon zipper would soon lead to zipper failure.) The concept of a case of that type and utility at such a good price was great, too bad it is not practical. Too bad."
5,"Finally, pop music that actually sounds fresh and original","Finally, an alternative act with some musicians who can actually play their instruments and right some really great tunes! This is a must listen for anyone who's gotten bored with the current state of pop music. Seriously, this band kicks a##."
5,Christmas Gift,"I haven't actually watched this yet as it is a gift for my Mother but I was thrilled it came as described, undamaged and it is out of print so not easy to get but got it here just fine. I intend to study this like a film student scene by scene and will let you know what I think when I'm done."
5,Litetouch made easy!,"We have a complete Litetouch System in our home. VanLaarhoven's book has proved invaluable to us when we need answers in a hurry. His trouble shooting techniques have shown us the way every time. We are so happy to have found his comprehensive, easy-to-read and understand manual."
2,NOT ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE - OR IS IT?,"Quite awhile ago I purchased this item however, when I did I did not realize it would not interface with Vista....surprise, surprise, I have a product I cannot use the way it should be. I have to ""guess"" how to use it as there are no instructions (remember does not interface). There was only one disc, although I read elsewhere there are probably 4 in the set. Humm, maybe this is one you need to double check with a real craftshop before you buy it.I loved what showed up for the cross stitch pattern with all the colors, but could not get it to printout the graph - useless. And, without all the other information - such as type of stitches - it is a guess as to what to do. Definitely won't work for the business purpose I had intended it, and don't see anything new enough to be able to replace it. Oh well."
1,Old Tech,"Im 75 and let me tell you about this productpros-- was new in a box and arrived very quickly in good conditioncons--This computer case is at least 10 years old and not very suited for todays computer needs, it comes not suited to todays sata needs ---the power supply is not sata power equiped.I was building a new computer so i had to get a new power supply in order to use this case so the cost was increased another 45$, a few days The Geeks offered to return my money if i returned it.This was a no option for me as the computer was already built,I told them they could send me another power supply of 420 watts that was sata ready but I havent heard back from them.My opinion old new computer equipment shold be labeled as such,I wonder how many others have been suckered this waythe total buying experience was not a good one"
2,You Can Do Better,"The sound of this system is very raspy and brittle. The subwoofer is muddy. The sensitivity is low, which means that you have to hit it with a lot of volume to get it to play at normal levels. There seems to be some ground loop problems when connecting it to a computer -- AC noise. I read about this on another review also. I bought this from ViewSonic directly on a special deal ($39), but I am returning it pronto. Ron in CA"
1,Freezes several times when playing DVD,"Got unit from Costco too. Read about this problem on A/V forums but thought it was an isolated problem. I guess not because the unit I got does the same, pauses at several random points for 1 to several seconds. Decided to return this unit because it couldn't do its basic function, play a DVD correctly.Otherwise, this unit would have gotten 4 stars, a very decent unit for the price. HDMI was good with the free HDMI cable, the remote buttons were laid out good and much more responsive than the slow Samsung HD755 remote I tried.One annoyance- a bright blue light shines out of the DVD tray slot. You can maually turn it of but it defaults to ON after power down."
3,Toshiba SD-K850,"Toshiba SD-K850$45 @ Fry's (Refurbished)I bought this as a temporary player til I decide PS3, XBOX360, BLu-Ray or HD-DVD. 45 bucks...can't beat it. The player has HDMI, Component, Optical, S-video & coax. I'm using HDMI (less clutter w/ cables). I'm not an expert on DVDs but I can say... the ""newer"" dvds seemed to look better than the older ones. The player has three modes (1080i/720p/480p). Rotating modes can be done with a click of a button. Quality is decent/good. I didn't have issues with pausing/delays. I'm sure there are up-1080i/720p players that are better but probably cost $$$$. BUY THIS TEMPORARY PLAYER IF YOU WANT A ""TRUE"" HD-DVD PLAYER BUT NOT SURE WHICH ROUTE TO GO. PEACEEEE...."
2,Trust the reviews here before buying!,"I read the reviews here and still tried one at Costco. Beware! The reviews here are accurate! I plugged it in, put a brand new DVD in it, and the thing started making a sound like a circular saw and not reading the disk. I assumed the unit was off balance (never had this happen with a DVD player before, despite working in a pawnshop for 10 years and handling thousands of different DVD players). The balance problem ended up being remedied by placing a small object on the right side of the player. This unit seems to have been designed to be sitting on an absolute perfectly flat surface and since mine was very slightly uneven, it caused problems. Even after eliminating the buzz saw nice, the player froze several times through two different DVDs. It's going back to Costco tonight. Please do yourself a favor and consider a different player. It's a shame to see Toshiba DVD players turning sour like this....they used to make such great players for the money."
2,Issues with upconversion,"This player seems like it has all the features one would want - and it certainly has all that I need, but there is a major bug in it. When using the upconversion, dvds often stop for up to 30 seconds in the middle of a scene and then continue playing. It has happened on both players that I have owned (on the second after I returned the first) I will be replacing this with one that is less buggy."
2,Just what I wanted,"The Bible was easy to read, (large print) and great quality for the money. It arrived promptly."
4,really nice atmospheric dreamy pop,"So far, I'm really loving this new release, which is Sonic Boom's remixing of several songs from Dean & Britta's last album.Highly recommended for fans of Mazzy Star, 1960's French pop (Serge Gainsbourg, Francoise Hardy), and things of that nature. Melodic songwriting, sultry vocals, and inventive production add up to a soothing, dreamy, romantic experience."
5,Dead Pirates against the Mast,"A wonderfully quirky book of photos of those corpses of New York's streets: wrecked bicycles attached to poles. These bikes, stripped to their frames, their tires bent in countless directions, are reminiscent of dead pirates, their skeletons left leaning against their ship's mast. Not a big glossy photo book, but that's probaly intentional:if it were, it would betray the subject. But these pictures are both funny and poignant, and it's one of the rare photography books that you'll want to look at every day."
5,Beat-up bikes get a second life,"New York City is a chaotic place. It's unforgiving and indifferent but alive with humanity and creative energy. The front lines of this daily struggle between the hopeful and harsh happen right here on the streets and sidewalks. Through bicycles locked to poles, Mr. Glassie captures the casualties of this struggle, showing us the relics of forgotten bikes overwhelmed by New York, yet physically bound to it. He's somehow found a tiny piece of every New Yorker's story and painted a portrait of how defeat can be a thing of beauty. And plus, lots of neat pics of banged-up bikes!"
2,not so much,"I was Really excited about this book- cool title, cool premise- until i got it & looked at it. the pictures are gritty, dark, and not in an artsy kind of way- and are all taken from the same height/angle. Instead of getting down & dirty & into his art, its as if the photographer didnt want to take a picture that would inconvience his walking. (i doubt new yorkers would look at you strange for squatting to take pics of a bike on the street?)The coolest picture by far is on the cover, and its not really a wonder why they put it first. i bought it for a gift but after looking at it... maybe ill just frame the cover?"
2,Good Concept - Disappointing Pictures,"I love bicycles, and living in the city - I take pictures of interesting bikes myself, so when I heard about this book I wanted to get it. The pictures are fairly uninspired, no interesting angles, etc. just the passer's by view - understandable if that is the concept/intention. The bigger complaint I have is the picture quality - none are sharp or detailed, all are kind of ""grey"" and fuzzy - if this is the intention I don't like it. My 3.2 megapixel takes much more detailed pics than these. Disappointing."
1,Too Big,Didn't fit into the ear because the ear buds were too big and there were no other sizes available to switch it out.
3,A quick take on a complex subject,"The history of the Flying Tigers in China is very complex, this show only brushes the surface.What I liked were the pilot interviews, both American and Japanese - this are historic artifacts that need to be maintained if we are to have any idea what courage and toughness was exhibited by fighting men on both sides of this conflict."
5,No Anniversary Edition?,"I saw this when it first came out on video, which was some time ago! I'm surprised a 25th anniversary edition wasn't made--with extra stuff, like interviews with the actors who are still around, maybe a mini-documentary about the true story on which it's based.Well, all those extra things would be nice, but let's face it: This is a gem no matter what!"
5,Norma Rae VHS,Just as I remember it. Thanks for a perfect item as described. I will keep you on my list of places to shop.
4,A textbook example of how to organize in your workplace!!,"I finally got the chance to watch this movie after missing out for almost 20 years. I should have watched this film years ago. Not only is Sally Field's acting great, but the screenplay was just as great as well. My only problem was the length of the movie as I thought 20 minutes could have been chopped off. With that said, this movie should be mandatory watching for all workers. If you care about the conditions in your workplace, watch it and learn how to organize your workplace!! It's a film much needed for required viewing in our society today!"
1,Terribly filmed,"I agree that this is a dismal DVD. The original filming is much of the problem, with the performance either not properly staged for film or the director having no idea how to capture ballet. Much of the time the feet of the performers are lopped off, and the overall effect is claustrophobic. Whatever was done to (supposedly) make this 5.1 Dolby wasn't beneficial. Oddly, quite frequently there is a silent momentary hiccup in the disc."
1,A disgraceful release of a legendary performance,"First of all, the low rating is entirely for this particular DVD issue, NOT for the performance.The legendary Maximova-Vasiliev/Bolshoi ""Nutcracker"" has seen various VHS and now DVD releases over the years. This is undoubtedly one of the worst I ever came across. The editing is simply a disgrace. In the first Act white spots start appearing all over the screen and on a couple of places entire seconds of footage are missing. The sound has never been much to write home about and nothing has been attempted to improve it for this DVD. (Don't believe it is dolby surround, as the cover pretends.) The presentation is zero.The same performance has also been released by Kultur Video on VHS and DVD, and has to be preferred to this one."
2,Good...if you are a ballet history buff.,This performance is so badly filmed that it's hard to enjoy the dancing. The level of sophistication is actually close to what one would expect from a couple of cameras at a High School performance. My goal is to find a performance of the Nutcracker with a little more thought gone into its production.
1,"Terrible, cheap towels","So I needed some baby sized towels for my new baby... I researched on Amazon and decided on the Waverly towels, was right by the Babies-R-Us one day, so I ran into buy those towels but was disappointed that my local Babies-R-Us did not have those towels. So after looking at what they did have I grabbed these.When I got home I took them out of the package to wash them. I was very disappointed by how thin and cheap they felt. They aren't even looped towel material on both sides, one side is fabric. Then I looked at what it was made out of. It has polyester in it! What a terrible, non-absorbant material for a towel!I promptly stuck them back in the packaging and now I have to make another trip out there to return them.I just ordered a towel off another site, $17 for one towel but I'm hoping the quality will be good this time."
5,Excellent introduction to Christian beliefs,"Concise and clear, this book explains all the foundational beliefs of Christianity in a way that would be okay with my Catholic friends as well as my fellow Protestants. It is an amazingly balanced and helpful introduction to the basics of Christianity. As far as I can tell, there really is no hidden agenda. I've looked for a long time for a simple book that explains historic Christian beliefs, and this is undoubtedly the best I've found. I'm going to recommend it for the adult Sunday School class at my church, and I wish the high school class would use it too. So many of them know next to nothing about what their church stands for... Reading this book would provide a helpful education for any Christian!"
3,I'm a little disappointed,"A little disappointed with this book. It is a good place for beginners to start, but doesnt go into the more technical aspects of pop-up construction. The ideas for shapes and pop-ups are explained, followed by a cut/fold/paste model you can put together yourself. However,there are no formulas given about what degrees of angles can be used, what the ratio of the planes to the bases are. Not a bad book, just not as advanced as I had hoped based on the cover drawing. Yes...I judged the book by it's cover :)"
4,Four full serials for one low price!,This set contains these four serials:New Adventures of TarzanZorro's Fighting LegionFlash Gordon Conquers the UniverseRadar Men From the MoonThese are the previous Roan released with a new slipcase. A great set.
3,Beware...,A cool dvd but if you already have Super Mario Bros 3 then you already have everything on this dvd. I rented this thinking it would be new episodes and it was the exact same episodes as ones found on the Mario 3.
1,Thin,"There are several superb books on the history of book design: Joseph Blumenthal, Art of the Printed Book 1455-1955; Norma Levarie, The Art and History of Books; S. H. Steinberg, Five Hundred Years of Printing; and Warren Chappell and Robert Bringhurst, A Short History of the Printed Word.Alas Alan Bartram's Five Hundred Years of Book Design is uninformative, unscholarly, and unpleasant. The analytical level is casual, adolescent. Readers will learn little about books from the thin text.The photographs of the great books, taken at the British Library, are murky and out of focus.How did Yale University Press come to publish this turkey?"
3,Disappointed,This movie was not as funny as I expected and it didn't even have that much smoking going on!!! I thought they were going to smoke more and hang out more with the girls. There could have been less running around too. But it was funny enough to make me want to know what would happen next.I never even heard of that movie either unil I was watching another older move and saw the preview for Killer Bud.
2,What a disapointment?,This movie sounded like it would be good. Though it does have a few good moments there are too many moments where David Faustino's character questions his sexuality that just feel out of place in this silly movie. It is worth watching but one watch is all you will need.
1,This movie is bad.,"[...]It came on after ""Jay & Silent Bob,"" which is Shakespeare compared to this brainlessness. The only funny part is when it suggests that Faustino is a huge [...] who gets off on his best friend and children, and the part where the girls discover that the tw have a huge collection of showtunes. Otherwise, the movie is full of huge cliches, and the plot, of course, makes no sense, but it's not really funny even in a stupid way. It's just goddamn stupid, and I don't know why it was made. Why the hell someone would consider actually purchasing this tripe on DVD is beyond me; wouldn't it be funny to see the person who actually buys this? They probably own movies with Rob Schneider, too. Don't let that clown be you."
2,"one really funny scene, otherwise, very mild humor","Good to see the actor in this doing something besides bud bundy. It was ok, I sat through it, laughed only a couple times, it was kinda dry though. Id rather watch ""jay and silent bob"", or ""the stoned age"" if your looking for something close to this. Maybe even cheech and chong"
3,"Dude, where's my bong?","Every few years a new pot smoking movie comes out. This one is no different. Dumb jokes, homophobia, and an equally strong addiction to weed and Pachinko, this comedy is just that. Comical. This movie appeals to teenagers and young adults. Corin Nemic and David Faustino do play convincing buddies. If you liked Cheech & Chong's ""Up in Smoke"" or ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" You'll enjoy this movie."
5,Really Funny!,"This is a really funny movie! David Faustino and Corin Nemac are great together and really seem like life-long friends, and Caroline Keenan and Danielle Harris (from Urban Legend) are great. It's not a typical stoner movie for me, but a simple comedy about the stupid things guys might do just to get the girls, and how girls know it and use them. The best part was when David Faustino thought we was going to jail and we cries, ""I'll be tortured and humiliated and some huge hairy man will make me toss his salad!"""
1,better off with buddy guy,"scotts a fine guitar player but come on! nobody can say his stuff is better than when he was with buddy! and as far as hendrix well go see bill perry or walter trout and then say holt can pull off hendrix. simple fact is his music lacks emotion. ive listened to him alot, my friend is a close friend of his."
4,Great blues-rock guitar,"This is an excellent CD. His blues guitar work and vocals are top notch. I really enjoyed the covers of ""Train in Vain,"" ""Crosstown Traffic,"" and ""You Gotta Serve Somebody."" If you like blues-rock guitar, this is worth checking out."
4,A SOLID BLUES CD,"Holt may well reach the standard of those he has been influencedby, but not yet. This is a good blues cd but not a great or original one. He sticks to the basic blues formulae and I don't think he is good enough to instill his own signature to the tunes he plays, consequently they are all fairly straight and recognisable blues fare.What is amazing is that DOUBLE TROUBLE, when backing him on 4 tracks lift the sound to another level, something the other backing bands don't manage. It is nowhere near as good or as original as DAVID GOGO, VINCE CONVERSE,ERIC GALES or SCOTTY HENDERSON,COLIN JAMES and MARK MAY amongst others.Had to add another star as 4 weeks listening revealed enough quality that escapes on first listens."
5,Awesome guitarist,"I have seen Scott live. He is a really exceptional player. I saw him with Buddy Guy and twice solo. His stuff solo is just as good as with Buddy. The person that said he couldn't play Hendrix must have been smoking something. I saw Scott do Hendrix to perfection! Besides it's easy to review a guy and really put him down when you're scared to leave your name and email address! ala ""A music fan"". Scott is well versed at blues and had the best teacher that a guy could get with Buddy. For crying out loud Hendrix used to steal licks from Buddy. Besides that capturing Hendrix on tape is much harder than you can imagine. Go try it yourself ""A music fan"" then I'll have some respect for your comments."
5,"5 stars for Syd Barrett, RIP",Syd Barrett will be greatly missed. His whimsical songwriting style was unique and greatly influenced many famous musicians like David Bowie. This dvd is an essential purchase for those wishing to know about a genuis.
1,Syd Barrett's First Trip on Pyschedelic Mushrooms,"This early footage of Syd Barrett, filmed in 1966 & 1967 by Nigel Gordon, a friend and photographer, portrays two aspects of Syd's early life. Part I, entitled: ""Gog Magog Hills,"" shows Barrett in a field named after the title while experiencing his first trip. Part II, entitled: ""Abbey Road Studios,"" shows Pink Floyd after just having signed their first recording contract with EMI Records outside Abbey Road Studios in April of 1967. Interesting footage, but not very well done. I would only recommend this to die-hard Pink Floyd fans."
1,Horrible,"This DVD is horrible, Discusting & very disrespectful to Mr.Barrett. Who in their right mind would film something like that. I am so discusted I cannot continute.So long!"
2,CAVEAT EMPTOR! BAD ODOR AHEAD!,"Look, I dig Syd and his music as much as the next guy. But there's no getting around it, folks. This one is pretty doggone cheesy. And that, honestly, is kind. Sure, there are some groovy shots of Syd gettin' high in the hills, but not very many. Not many at all. And there are an awful lot of shots where (a) Syd is nowhere to be seen, and (b) you, the viewer, don't have a clue as to what the hell is going on.This disc is all of 10 minutes long. That's right, 10. Syd's on screen for maybe 6. The overall quality is that of a mediocre home movie, made by a stoner in 1966. As for insights into Syd's makeup/development as an artist/psychedelic experiences/etc. etc. etc.......pretty much zilch. If you gotta have it, you gotta have it. Just don't expect a whole lot."
2,syd's first trip + music,"i have a copy of the original 16 mm film - the musical additions.personally i think it's more accurate and less commercial without the audio, more thought provoking, i think.i recommend the silent version for any serious roger barret fan.thank you for your timescott"
3,Pro Editor required,"Not sure of the complete story of what happened with EH, I was curious to learn more. The history of the start up venture was interesting as were stories from Sturgis. Even the section of the ""gearhead"" related topics weren't too hard to follow, as I was afraid I'd be confused. But overall, I don't really understand what happened except that the financing options ran out. But why? That area is foggy and seemed condensed in the later chapters. It makes you wonder what the 2nd side of the story is. I think some professional editing would've helped in the story, as well. The writing was obviously as Dan Hanlon would speak aloud. But that tone gets tiresome and he sometimes gets off on tangets. Perhaps the book wouldn't have been as long either."
4,HERMIE,"IT IS A GOOD CARTOON BUT THE VOICES ARE ANNOYING, OF COURSE THE FELLOWS BEHIND THE CHARACTERS ARE OLD. IT'S A GOOD STORY FOR CHILDREN."
3,"Good teachings, poor script","I gave this movie a ""3-star"" because although the concept and teaching is great, I have a hard time watching it. Some of the Hermie Movies are great (Buzby, Milo) but others are just lacking interesting story lines, including this one. Thanks!"
4,Helpful Wisdom in Suffering times,James Kok offers wisdom and cautions that can help both those who are suffering and those who want to help someone who is hurting. His views have grown out of many years of personal experience helping people to deal honestly with the ragged edges of life. I recommend it as a practical and also faith-building resource. His insights are sensitive and realistic.
3,"right features, needs improvement","Cord is a little stiff for winding up - outer jacket could stand to be a little softer, but the trade-off is a tougher skin. The locking plug is not intuitive to use, but it does work as it should - takes a second or two to figure out how to lock/ unlock. The illuminated end works. 45 feet of cord is weird - why not 50? Kind of like how peanut butter and mayo jars have that conical indent in their bases to reduce selling volume! I always get 12 gauge cords so I don't starve my tools for voltage. As a pro, I expect to get 10 yrs heavy duty service from this tool."
5,Excellent,"Myriam Hernandez Una de las mejores voces de todos los tiempos en españolEste Concierto es imprecionante ella con su excelente voz, coristas y banda musical excelente tambien. 5 estrellas para este concierto."
4,"Great Minds, Great Book","This sourcebook for great theology has helped me to understand the historical dynamics at work for the last two hundred years. Simple in format but not in the subjects tackled, it covers the minds that daily affect our worship. My only criticism is that too many subjects are included: a little more depth on major topics would make it even better. The sources are chosen with God in mind, and are an acomplishment in expression for the Christian faith. An excellent read, praise of Jesus Christ is throughout."
3,"It works, but the magnet isn't very strong","The basket work well, but it would be nice if the magnet was stronger it is pretty easy to knock it off accidently."
2,A bit too little,"The motorcycle owner's manual is a small book. Yet, it tries to cover a wide range of services needed for the motorcycle. Of course it can dedicate only a page or two to a subject. This book is nice if you want the general idea, but if you want something more percise, you'll need a larger book."
4,Good for Complete Beginners,This is a good book for complete beginners. I had the tiniest bit of motorcycle knowledge and I found the book a little basic. The main problem with it is that it doesn't tell you anything that a good shop manual doesn't; but it can't really be used on its own. So it's sort of superfluous.I would recommend it to parents who are trying to get their kids into motorcycling (and teaching them to be responsible for their own maintanance). The pictures are useful and the tone of the book seems to be aimed at teenagers.
3,"A good, basic, supplemental book.","This is a good book to go along with the manufacturer's manual. On it's own, its not that great. It gives more basics than the owner's manual that came with your bike, but if you're hoping for something to help you in a job that's more than just routine maintenance, you're SOL. I rented this book from the library. I'm going to buy the OEM (original equipment manufacturer's) manual and see where I end up. If it's too hard to follow, I'm going to buy this one. The photos are great, they are more helpful than most drawings. If you have a Suzuki 500cc twin, this is a good book. He uses that bike for most of his illustrations because it's so simple."
3,Not for the beginners,"I have read this book. Contains very bright beautiful pictures, but nothing more than that for ordinary people like me. I am sure you will love this book if you are accustomed to mechanics or an engineer. If not, don buy it!!"
1,Motorcycle Owner's Manual,"This book is a shallow and generalized regurgitation of any owner's manual which would accompany your new motorcycle. If you like 'flash and jangle', much space is taken up with big, glossy photographs and illustrations. Should you buy a used bike unaccompanied by it's manual, spend the money wisely by ordering one from the manufacturer! If you're looking for information on a level beyond that contained in your specific manufacturer's motorcycle manual, put the money towards your models' service manual; either from the manufacturer or aftermarket publishers. I returned my order promptly, and learned my lesson at the expense of the shipping costs...both ways!"
1,Printed in China,A pretty basic book which unbeknownst to me when I placed my order is printed in China on cheap stock. I try to buy made/printed in the USA products when possible and never buy Chinese. I know it's hard to do but I don't need anything badly enough to sell out my beliefs for a couple of dollars in savings for a lower quality product. Save your money. I'm sending this one back.
2,This book is very basic,"I was expecting much more from this book. It did cover the basics of most maintenance items, but it is a far cry from the manufacturers maintenance/service manuals. If you are completely inexperienced in mechanics I think it would be a good book."
3,Could be better,"This is a very basic maintenance book. Like someone told here, a compilation of several user's manuals. Very well illustrated, nice pics, good advices, but falls short in going into the deep issues of bike maintenance. Buy it only if you're quite new to motorcycling."
3,Fun Yoga for Grandparents,"40 minute program of basic stretches for the aging population, with playful ideas to spend time with young grand children. The stretches demonstrated may be too difficult for the beginner who does not exercise regularly, but with effort, one can keep up with the participants. The no-pressure, easy approach will be encouraging to the practitioner. Breathing and meditation are touched on, thereby not losing the essence of Yoga.The program emphasizes being happy, but the narrator keeps mentioning 'problems' and 'solutions', as though this is a counseling session."
2,Very little about VS 2005!,"I downloaded the eBook and within a couple of minutes realised that it only had one Chapter specifically abour VS 2005. As the first para in Chapter 1 point out:""When you installed Visual Studio .NET 2005, you might have been surprised to find a bonus-VisualWeb Developer. This new product fills a gap in the Visual Studio product line and is Microsoft's recognitionthat Web development has become a major part of the application market."" So the book is about Visual Web Developer and should have been entitled as such.There is a chapter later in the book about migrating your VS 2003 projects and the final chapter ( Chapter 25! ) has the following ""This chapter addresses the code movement process from a little project to big project perspective.It assumes that you've experimented with Visual Web Developer Express and now need the full capabilitiesthat Visual Studio can provide."" Too little too late... Unless you want to find out about Visual Web Developer, buy something else."
1,Slow Shipping from DVD Legacy,I ordered 3 DVD's from DVD Legacy. This is the only one I received. My credit card was charged for all 3 of them. DVD Legacy would not respond to my inquiries. Amazon never offered to help.
1,"such good ideas, such bad execution","This movie could've been great. Yet the dialogue is horrible, the complex relationship between the crow and J.J is not explained...it's butchered. This is an utterly horrible movie that just seemed to never end. Robert Redford can't perform better than the horrible role written for him and him fishing in the beginning of the movie shows how much the rest of movie will pale considering what it could've been.Horrible! Someone mentioned reading ""Crow Killer"" about J.J., just don't buy this horrid movie!"
4,A Western of the Quiet Kind,"This is a western full of surprises and not at all what one would expect in that genre. Different, well done, and would recommend it."
3,Jeremiah Johnson,"The picture was fine. But we had to restart the movie because it stopped in the middle,. This is the third time we have had this probloem with films."
5,My husbands favorite!,My husband remembered watching this movie when he was in high school and he wanted to watch it again. We found it on amazon and he watched it again and thinks its one of the best movies he has ever seen.
5,It ought a been differant....,"One of the best movies of all time. Total classic. great one liners, breathtaking scenery, great acting, so on and what have you."
5,One of the three best Westerns ever made.,"Jeremiah Johnson, based on the true story of a mountain man whose last name was actually Johnston, is one of those rare movies that will burn itself into your memory. Beautifully filmed in the Wasatch mountains of Utah (near Robert Redford's Sundance Institute) and Zion National Park, this film envelops the viewer in the day to day struggle of man to survive. Redford and the late Will Geer give memorable performances as the mountain men you wish could go on forever. I rate Jeremiah Johnson among the three best Westerns ever made, along with The Searchers and Red River."
5,Jeremiah Johnson,Simply wonderful. Redford bought part of the land on the film and resides there now.
5,Inspiring classic,"Redford is great in Jeremiah Johnson. Without much dialogue, his character manages to develop into a legend through the movie. The story exemplifies how independence can conflict with companionship."
5,Sharks,Anyone that has watched this movie over the age of 30 can't possibly find any flaw with it. The only problem with this movie is that it is not in BLU-RAY. Why not?
4,Good.,"This movie was good. It reminded me a bit of ""Dances with wolves"", but nothing wrong with that right? It was violent, and probably a bit too much for any kids under 10."
5,Awesome movie!,Loved this adventurous movie! It had many events that I didn't see coming. Totally a man's man's movie! I would recommend it to anyone who loves adventure and survival.
2,The wrong DVD!,"I purchased the DVD entitled ""Jeremiah Johnson"" to give as a holiday gift! I received a Jeremiah Johnson DVD case with a cellophane seal ! When my recipient opened my gift, she said ""There's a ""West Side Story "" DVD in this case! I was shocked!! I ordered a Jeremiah Johnson DVD and received a West Side Story DVD , instead!!! My recipient welcomed the West Side Story DVD! I am very disappointed !! I hope , in the future, that when I order a particular product, I receive the product that I ordered!"
5,I love this film - and finally bought a copy for my video library,"Robert Redford is completely believable as Jeremiah Johnson, a man who chooses to become a fur trapper and mountain man hermit but then learns to love an Indian wife he hadn't planned to marry and an adopted son he hadn't planned to adopt.It is a different kind of Indian vs Settler story, where Redford's character helps save a bunch of stupid settlers trapped in the mountains, but in the process angers the local Indian tribe and ends up the focus of seemingly endless raids and attacks.I've been wanting a copy for my video library for a long time."
5,"widescreen, scenic, but not too accurate, still a story","One side is full screen, one side widescreen 2.35:1Lotsa unreal matters that a ""flatlander"" might think correct but trying to catch a fish walking in cold water is a fine way to freeze your feet and die shortly afterwards.Snow is real, so's the mountain scenery. A bit of a story rather loosely based on ""Liver-eatin Johnson"" but still a story especially for those aint never seen real snow, mountains, streams, hunting, trapping, bow and arrow, old black powder guns, horses, and such other lost in history. An America almost gone. Film was notable in its time and still has merit.Price is low.""Can't cheat the mountain, pilgrim."""
4,Good story; Great setting,"Very entertaining with great scenery. Liked every moment. One of Redford's best, in my opinion. Spectactular scenery, well acted on all fronts."
4,great,Husband & son both love this movie & have watched it several times!! Great shape with no scratches
4,Classic mountain movie,Good watch if you like this sort of thing. Great cinematography. Watch it if you enjoyed playing Red Dead Redemption.
5,My fave movie,"I absolutely love this movie, so I had to have it! I received it in good condition, and will watch it until it wears out. At which time, I will purchase another copy. Love the scenery."
5,excellent service,i really liked the fast response you gave me for this product. Keep up the good work.
1,Disappointment,"Jeremiah Johnson is a movie I love; it's a mountain thing. I got this DVD because I thought the video would be so much better than my old VHS and it was. My disappointment was that the audio was very poorly synchronized to the video on this DVD. My recommendation would be to listen to the sound track or watch the video, just don't do both at the same time. Shame on you Amazon for not having better quality control on your merchandise."
2,horrible quality,"Great old movie, but looks like it is a bootleg video from Mexico. Very blurry picture, would not recommend this ."
5,Great Movie,Jeremiah Johnson is one of Robert Redford's best movies. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the outdoors and is a Robert Redford fan.
4,Mountain Man,"Jeremiah Johnson had a lot to learn during his journey through the rugged mountains and life during those days of Indian raids and tough living. It is a story that keeps you interested in the outcome, though sad in context.The sound on this video was strong in some places and weak in others. The volume button on our remote was used constantly for either up or down. The views of the mountains, however, were exceptionally gorgeous. All of the color was splendid."
5,Classic,This movie is a classic. I will always remember watching it with my father. He recently passed away and I felt I needed a copy of my own.
3,Jeremiah Johnson gone wild!,"This movie makes me wanna go live out in the mountains and quit my full time dock job. You know, have a nice horse and don't have to worry about gas prices, etc."
3,"A great movie, dissapointingly edited","The original Jeremiah Johnson was a beautiful, violent, tragic, epic of love, hate, vengance and redemption. It was with great dissapointment and some anger that I discovered that the producers of the DVD have shortened the movie, eliminating most of the scenes of violence and basically rendering it a collection of nice shots of the Utah mountains. This has been done without explaination, apology or even warning; the movie is now less than two hours long (but with intermission intact) and contains many clumsy cuts in the last third, during the indian fighting scenes. The remaining film still contains a shadow of the original epic but I wish it had remained intact."
4,Preachy but good,"I really enjoyed this when I saw this back in 1973. I bought it on VHS and DVD recently. As a living history (re-enactor if you will) person, I enjoy films like this. I find it on the edge of being a 'message' movie just on the border with entertainment. I really like the in-depth mind probe of the film based on ""Liver-eatin' Johnston"" a real life mountain man. It was also pretty authentic. Suprising for a film on the end of the 60's."
5,Great Movie!,This movie is older but really good. I recommend for people who like movies such as Tom Sawyer or Clint Eastwood movies.
5,Jeremiah Johnson,"I think this is one of Robert Redford's better films ... he's awesome, the scenery is awesome and the story is awesome. I guess you can tell I like this movie!"
3,"Cute enough, but not a brain surgury textbook","I thought that this was quite OK for what it is. The artwork's pretty good - it actually looked like the actors sometimes, which is pretty amazing. The plots of the short stories wouldn't make an episode, but they're funny and it's great brain mush."
3,"OKAY, BUT I EXPECTED BETTER!","I HAVE READ ALL THE BUFFY BOOKS SO FAR, INCLUDING THE COMICS AND THIS RANKED PRETTY LOW ON MY LIST!!"
2,Wrong PLUG!!,i requested a REGULAR extension cord to plug into a house hold plug. There was NO specification that this extension cord is for a dryer or a range. doubt i will be able to return it 60 bucks down the drain because of an unclear description.
2,Not Up to Par,This is a 62 page book with instructions for 18 quilts for the beginning quilter to the advanced. I found only 3 quilts that I liked but not enough to make any but one of them. This is a book which I'll be putting in my next yard sale. You might want to check this out at a library or book store before deciding to buy. If the library doesn't have it you could order it through a book store to view.
5,Love this!,"I was concerned about purchasing a used CD, but it is in perect condition, and the CD is as good as I remember from when it first came out."
5,Standing up to the test of .. Time and Tide,"Great to hear the amazing voice of Basia again on CD after many years, as I orginally had this CD on cassette tape, given to me by my sister as a present, so it has brought back many memories!! I love every song, as each song is catchy and beautifully sung, that keeps playing over and over in my head, once I have stopped playing the CD!! It is such a pleasure to have Basia's music amongst my collection of music again, standing up to the test of Time and Tide. Josyyo1, New Zealand."
5,Quick service,"Looked all over for this CD, nobody had it or was on back order until the end of eternity. From the time when the order was processed it was here within 4 days.....thanks!!!!!"
5,Best crusin music ever!,"I have been listening to this CD for 20 years and never ever tire of it! My favorite memory is driving the windy hilly beautiful roads of the Adirondacks on a summers Sunday.... at about 5 pm when the sun is just hitting the top of the mountains with my purple (well probably periwinkle)Honda Preludes sunroof open............ looking down over the river with the mountains in the backdrop and Time and Tide full volume! Basia makes music with life meaning, incredible sound and vocals that are complex enough to never tire of and consistent enough that I can sing along and feel great while doing it. I love this girl!! Thanks so much Basia!"
4,Sweet as honey,"Debut solo album by Basia Trzetrzelewska from Poland initially released during 1985 by EPIC then a label of CBS Records. It is still a great adult contemporary album and truly enjoyable after all the years since first released. Moreover, it does not lose appeal with repeated play.Basia is an inspirational vocalist with tremendous voice control who never resorts to self-indulgent stunts or vocal explosives. Plus, she solely sings all harmonies with perfection.Since you can purchase this for $0.01 plus shipping, this is a truly great bargain. Just because she never achieved stardom does not diminish her talent nor this album,"
4,Reliable seller,"The CD I ordered was in the condition described or better. I have to wonder why Amazon told me it was shipped June 9 and would arrive June 29 or 22 days later, which it did. Why so long?? I know USPS is major snail rate but Pony Express would have had it here much sooner! What gives?"
5,Great CD! Bossa Nova in English!,"Basia is one of the best Bossa Nova singers in the world. She could be compared with the Brazilians DIVAS Gal Costa, Zizi Possi and Elis Regina. Time and Tide brings us to the waves of Rio de Janeiro and the entire Brazil. Basia debut album is one of her best. She shines!!!! Great work!!!!"
5,Best of Basia,I bought this album in 1989. She has such a great voice and the music is a joy to listen. A must have.
3,"homophobes,albinos and cat killers oh my!!","wow this made me think i could make a movie! if you enjoy movies like happiness, kids,bully you will like to be disturbed by this as well. if your parents were absent in your early teens and you took what drugs and booze were at hand you will be nostalgic. the movie moves right along and before you know it its over though not in a disjointed way. some line delivery is a bit wooden but all the actors are beleivable. im sending a copy to my dad to further reveal to him what it was like growing up me!"
1,how did anyone watch this?,"Well, here I am running into the problem that there is no zero star rating. I honestly don't know how the people working on this film were even able to stand it.If something positive can be said for this movie, it is that is will make you grateful for all the other good movies that are out there. I'm not a stickler for traditional plots - Koyaanisquatsi was a great movie without a plot. But this was just awful. LEonard maltin (above) hit it on the nose."
1,This Movie Will Make You Dumber !!!,"This is the worst piece of c**p I have ever seen..The guy who made this movie must have been on some bad drugs...Also who gave this guy money to make this movie??? Hollywood has gotten worse over the years in movie quailty, but come on.. But if you have to throw-up fast forward to the part where the kid eats his dinner in the bathtub..I almost lost it right there~.Avoid this movie unless you want to feel dumber~"
1,"I am actually from Xenia, and this is not about Xenia","This movie is a sick display of what never happened in Xenia.I won't be able to get those 90 minutes of my life back but thankfully, I didn't waste any money on that piece of filth some refer to as a movie. I have lived in Xenia for about 5 years now and I have never known anyone who sells cat carcasses to chinese restaurants, constantly wears pink bunny ears, wrestles with chairs, or eats dinner in the bathtub. I know the movie is supposed to be set in my hometown but even our white trash isn't that white trash. So, thank you, Harmony Korine, for putting Xenia on the map. Now the world can see what a well-bred, civilized little town we are."
4,a good use of digital video,"no plot, but good looking and nice to watch. it's not like it's three hours long or something, quick and a/effective"
4,dude...,"WTF... I live in Xenia, OH!!! I'm moving tomorrow! After watching this movie I had to take a shower... but the dirt won't come off!!!"
2,gummo,"weired movie, funny parts but this is the kind of movie you watch only when your high; ""crazy thing is"", i dont get high. wasnt the best movie!"
1,"I'm from Xenia, and it ain't nothin like this","The way the film portrays Xenia makes it look like the whole town is like this. I know for a fact that it is not. While the town is not the greatest out there, it was a pretty decent place to grow up in. The producer of this one probably sniffed a little too much glue himself. Visit the place before you submit a 5-star review and you'll see that this film is way off track."
1,Overblown crap,"I'm from a little town in Ohio and it's pieces of crap like this getting out into the mainstream that give the whole place a bad name. Yeah we have our share of poor white trash just like every other town in the U.S (and I'm sure plenty of towns overseas have em too). But what we and most every other town has is plain folks trying to get by. What the @!*&!!! Even the poorest white trash wouldn't whore out their mentally handicapped child. We may not have multimillion dollar homes and prance around in expensive cars but what we do have is pride. Yeah we tend to do stupid stuff and gravitate to shows like COPS but I can throw out a few Hollywood names that would make even the most idiotic repeat offender say""Damn they's stupid."" I did my duty as a servicemember to defend the rights of these filmakers to @#$* out any piece of crap they want...just don't advertise that you made this in any of the little Ohio towns I know."
1,Stinker,"Whew. I though I liked weird movies until I saw this junk. You've got to really be so completely opened minded to enjoy this film that your brains fall out. Want to see an ""art"" film that makes no sense? Then watch any David Lynch film. At least with Lynch at the helm you can feel the talent behind the camera. Not with Gummo, though. This is junk posing as art. It's a wonder so many have been suckered into to believing this crap has any deep meaning or significance."
3,Bizarre and Disturbing Lives Without Parental Guidance,"Gummo takes place in a small Ohio town where the audience follows some kids that lead bizarre and disturbing lives without parental supervision or guidance. The imagery is grotesque and distressing as it dissects the daily life of the children and displays their violent nature. The film elicits thoughts of social learning as the children display adult behaviors and seek attention and affection in adult-like patterns. The adults escape their reality through alcohol as the kids do through glue. The morbid tone is enhanced as the film is displayed like documentary, which it is not. In the end Gummo offers an interesting perspective as it does not have a beginning nor an ending. It merely displays scenes that should initiate thoughts of the disturbing reality of children without parental guidance, which leaves the audience in disbelief."
2,Not much reason to watch this film...,"Lots of weridos performing outlandish acts in this film. The message seems to be ""Everyone is anormal, and varies only by the degree."" But other than yelling out this common sense statement, there is not much else worthy about this film."
3,Difficult to Look At,"A grim little film. Somewhat crummy production values - but that shouldn't be a suprise. It's difficult to tell the actors apart from the actual human beings in this one and the director appears to have wanted to blur the line between reality and ""the movies."" It's hard to believe, though, that anyone's reality is as unrelentingly grim, filthy, ignorant, and repulsive as the lives depicted in this film. In the end, though, the director's condescension eeks through the muck. There is a certain inhumanity in deliberately filming human beings in such a state (whether fictionalized or not). What's the point - if not to shock and demoralize (or carve a vulgar new niche in Hollywood's ever ratcheting downward spiral)? On the lighter side, though, the film does have its moments (when, appallingly, you actually find yourself laughing). Enjoy - but not after eating shellfish (they might make an unwelcome reappearance if eaten before sitting down to watch ""Gummo"")."
2,Want my two hours back..,"From an entertainment stand point, this is the movie I use to compare all other bad movies (until I watched Tree of Life). Artistically, this has interesting camera angles and perspectives but I'm not a film expert - only a spectator. Thus, I like to be entertained and not put to work."
4,"Great look, great feel, great movie.","Gummo, I heard about this movie from friends. They told me that it was different from other films. They were right, it gives that feeling that someone is just video taping everyday people, not actors but people. The movie has some funny points and some odd points, but all good though. I recomend this movie to all movie lovers that are looking for something that isn't sugar coated."
5,America's True Face!,"No film better represents the utter disgust and rejects of America. As a TRUE independent film, ""Gummo"" pushes taboo subjects to the ultimate limits. It's not for anyone, but everyone should see it. See your true face America!"
2,Amateurish,"Not the shock to the consciousness it strives to be. Instead it comes off as boring and contrived. There were too many instances and attempts to try to make a statement, and that gave a forced feeling to the movie. The film is a victim of strained scheming which does not allow the viewer to be affected by the content of the images, and the movie comes off as being shallow. The acting is poor and amateurish - the actors frequently take glimpses of the camera, appear wooden or just try too hard. I did enjoy the variety of bizare appearing characters who looked like John Waters or Coen brothers rejects. Also, there were a number of voice overs to home movie quality footage which added a subtle sweetness to the film."
1,Ugly people doing ugly things,This is total mind-pollution. This movie lacks a plot a seems like a compendium to the Jerry Springer show. I want my 88 minutes back. Harmony got lucky with KIDS.
4,I don't know who most of you people are...,"but how in the world was anyone seriously offended or disturbed by this movie? Loosen your belt a little. Yes, there are some mildly shocking things going on, but had you never heard anything about this film before? The way I've heard people talk about it, I really expected this to blow my mind. Maybe it would if you had never seen a movie before or were 12 years old, but neither of those apply to me. People keep complaining about the ""lack of plot"", but since when has it ever been necessary for a film to create a cut-and-dry story for it to be entertaining? This is a documentary-style fictional account of the lives of some off-kilter people in a less than fortunate setting. It is genuinely amusing at many points, and I sincerely enjoyed it. Don't believe the hype about this being so fantastically disturbing. Unless you read cat fancy or live in a world without sexual depravity or poverty, you should only cringe a bit."
1,This Way to the Egress,"All of you who think this movie is Great Art have been bamboozled. This is just pretentious swill. There are those who insist upon catagorizing anyone who dares to criticize this movie as conformists and idiots. To them I say, pretentious swill like Gummo can be just as obnoxious as mindless swill like Armageddon. In fact, the two movies are similar. One uses exploding rocks and loud noises to pummel you into submission, and the other uses freakish and garish imagery to pummel you into submission."
1,Please give me a time machine...,"so I can get back the time wasted on this ""film."" Now, I enjoyed Kids somewhat. So I decided to watch Gummo. Holy Jesus! I sat there for the duration of the film just wondering what exactly was going on. I was literally depressed by the time I finished watching the movie. There is no plot. There isn't anything! This movie is absolutely horrible."
1,time better spent elswhere,"Here are some alternative suggestions to watching this movie:1) spend the hour and a half in a forest preserve out house...2) try making your own crystal meth and then doing it3) eat some spoiled chicken, get sick, puke and then role around in it.4) piss in your pants and don't change your clothesDoing one or all of the above is a far better experience than sitting through this piece of vile trash."
1,Last night......,"Last night I watched a movie. This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. This movie was about nothing. This movie wasted my night. I hate that I rented this movie. I can't believe they can legally have this movie in the movie store. Horrible, horrible movie.I could see how some people might enjoy this movie, like if they were sleeping while it was playing. I wish I would have slept instead of watching this trash. Man, please do not waste your time, nobody should like this movie. I dont know how it got such a good review."
1,Worst Movie,"I went to the movie rental store and we always saw this movie, we laughed about it because it looks so stupid. We finally rented it and laughed so hard. It's the worst movie you could ever rent, everyones depressed in the film and it has no plot. We laughed at how stupid it was, i would never watch this again and I wanna beat the director of this movie up. He's horrible and hes pretty sick, i listened to the commentary. He should just kill himself or have someone else kill him. i would"
4,Sic film but good,"I've not buy this film, but I've seen this on tv, And this movie is pure dark sense of humor. Anyone may find this movie drama and some may find this movie fun and comedian.I like sic films like this one.Its a very hateful movie, and in some scenes they show they hate on this film for example the satanic scene and when someone scars his arm with the name Slayer one it. I found this movie some like drama/comedy."
3,SMALL TOWN AMERICA FREAK SHOW.,"This film eloquently shows what the rest of the world have always known, that small town America is full of inbred Morons, come to think of it, midwest cities are full of these morons as well."
5,Misunderstood masterpiece.,"I'm getting to be an ""old fart"". I'm 43. I have seen way more than my share of movies. I own scores of films. But I have never, ever, seen anything like GUMMO.This movie is not for everyone. This movie is not an artistic ""statement"". This movie is a (ta-da!!) movie. Don't let all the cynics scare you away.That all being said, let me wholeheartedly recommend GUMMO. I do suggest that you don't watch it alone. You definitely need someone in the room with you because you will not believe what you are seeing.There is nothing overly graphic or sick in this film. But there are disturbing scenes. And don't let anyone tell you that towns/people like this don't exist. They do.Rent it, buy it or steal it. But please watch it."
5,Hats off to Korine,"This movie (like kids) is supposed to be a wake up call to America but this one is oh so much better. He corrects his wrong by making all the people in the movie so incredibly unlikable no one in their right mind would like to emulate. Unlike kids where I found my friends start talking like Tele and Casper thinking what they do is cool, Gummo shows all the people living an obviously pathetic and downright horrible life. So to Harmony Korine I bow down to you."
2,A huge step back from KIDS,"In my personal opinion, i felt Gummo to be a boring film. Harmony Korine is a talented individual, but it seems that this film was missing an important element. That element was a storyline. Kids is a masterpiece,due to the fact of a great storyline. I didnt feel a connection with the characters of Gummo. I felt there wasnt a main focus to the film. It was sprawled out disconnected. But never the less, i did understand his reasoning for taking you into the world we stereotype as white/trailer trash. But overall, Gummo is a million pieces to a puzzle that aren't put into the right slots."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"Harmony Korine relies on pushing the obvious hollywood buttons of sex and violence as much as the indie-film staples of prolonged silences and downbeat dialogue delivery. The main thing making Gummo stand out in the film landscape and seem creative rather than formulaic is the vignette style of filmmaking, the rarity of which gives the film it's novelty value."
5,Nothing as Great,"This film to me is one of the greatest works of our time. Its contains everything that is true to culture. The truth in it is there, Kids do sniff glue, listen to Black Death Metal and Eat food in the bathtub. Its all there, kids do everything in that movie,its also a true work of art, visually its extordinary. This film is great and the people who don't see the genius in it are looking at it from being programed to only like one type of film with one type of plot. Life and rality has no plot, if you like the film read ""A crack-up at the race riots"" by Harmony korine (who wrote and directed this film). Anyway mabey only kids can understand it, I'm 13 and i saw it when i was 12 and thought i was great. See the film. - Rust"
5,"REALITY AT ITS SCARIEST, BUT MOST HONEST","This movie isn't one you sit down with the family to watch for entertainment while eating popcorn. It doens't have a plot - it's not supposed to! Reality doesn't have a plot. This film shows what kids and adults do in their spare time in a small town while there's nothing else to do. It's scary at times and definetely depressing. The cinematography is amazing - all the still shots and the flashes of little horrific scenes are great. Some people say it's stupid and boring and plotless and so on and so on, but those are the people who are afraid to admit that what they just saw is reality. And it's depressing."
3,There really isn't anything unusual about this,"If you really want to see what this film is about...open your eyes and look around. There isn't a single completely original situation in this film. There is, however, quite a bit of originality in the visual styling. There really isn't anything in this I didn't see or do as a kid growing up in the rural suburbs. The first time I saw it I laughed because, well, it was funny. The second time I watched I turned it off halfway through. It's a good one to show to people who have never seen it. Especially if you grew up with them as friends or siblings"
2,the red head kid is the ugliest child ever seen on any movie,this movie though somewhat boring still brought a sense of sheer stupidity to my world
5,a trivial revelation...,"i heard this film only cost 10,000 dollars to create, money decently spent. its random plot throws emotion in your face and you don't know if your supposed to laugh or cry. i say brilliant. although it makes you want to be in the shower for the rest of your life its worth watching until you can understand every word of diologue. an artistic masterpiece....I think i'm in love with bunnyboy."
3,A horrid look into the lives of a small rural town.,"""Gummo"" is a movie which peers into the lives of several individuals growing up in a town recently ravaged by a tornado. Living conditions are so poor that it makes the viewer think twice about their own status. Though some scenes are humorous, many are shocking and can leave the viewer in a discontent state. Although the movie lacks a solid story line, it is still worth a screening."
5,FROM GEOGOGIA: I THOT IT WAS GOOOD AN MY MAMA LUVED IT,"I LIKD THA PART WERE THA KIDS WAS SNIFFIN GLU. I WENT OUT AN TRID IT MY SELF, AND I DUN GON TO DA MEGINCY ROOOM."
5,One of the Greatest Movies......,This movie is fantastic! It is one of the strangest things I have ever seen...I loved every minute of it! There is no other movie quite like it. I found the bathtub scene to be the most disturbing...well maybe the chick shaving her eyebrows.....or maybe the grandmother scene....or....
4,Gummo - How twisted can you get?,"On first seeing this fim in the video store, I was taken by the weird cover. I thought, ""it looks weird, I must watch it!"" Seems as though you can judge a book by it cover. This was the most weird and hilarious movie I have ever seen.I would totally recommend it to those strange people out there like myself who get a laugh out of the weird, obscure and down right sick.The most fascinating part about this movie is that this sort of thing actually goes on in the world today. Consider this when you are watching it and , no matter what you do, DON'T PASS THIS MOVIE."
1,run!,this movie was awful. Please spare your friends and family. Only buy this for your enemies. GO find a better movie. You'll thank me.
4,Gummo,"A strange little flick from a flaky dude. I can definitely see why some people think this movie sucks. It's not for everyone. I thought it was entertaining in a ""what the heck am I watching"" kind of way. I watched a little of the special features and the dude that made the movie is one of those artsy fartsy ""look how deep and strange I am"" kinda people. I think he's a schlep but the movie is ok for the right crowd."
4,Way over priced,I liked this movie when i first saw it .But never would i pay 29 dollars for a dvd .
2,hmmmmmmm,i did not like gummoit was a little bit inbredi like willy wonkagummo is strangeunlike willy wonkawhich makes perfect sense
1,Terrible................,"This is a sham of a movie. I live an hour south of Xenia. Xenia is a crappy place, but that is because of the gang violence from all those wanna be thugs. One of the worst movies ever made, hands down."
1,T-e-r-r-i-b-b-l-e,"Chances are, this is the worst movie ever made. There really is nothing to get at all. Pass on this one, seriously. I hate this movie. Retards killing cats really does sum it up.pure gargage"
5,gummo-riffic,i love this movie. the characters are so real and sweet. it gets better every time i watch it.
1,cult of brain wash,"Watch out! there is cult of people whose sole mission seems to be to try and trick you into thinking this is a movie that has any value. The latest Scwarzenneger film has more content. Furthermore, it's likely more intellectual. If you want to watch your neighbor's naughty kids home video, go ask. You don't need to buy this tape they're hocking."
1,pompous... I want my $.99 rental-coupon back,"Harmony Korine. What a winner. Watching mold grow gives me more artsy-fartsy good feelings than watching this, uh, narcissistic load of crap. Instead of buying this waste of media, would any of you buy a home movie of my dog defiling my carpet? 'Cause I would really like to call myself an artist and pass that off as cinematic art."
3,Bad communicator,"I purchased this while inadvertantly missing the fact that it was VHS. Immediately after sending request, noticed my error, contacted seller and asked what I should do. Was told to return as unaccepted and did so. Could not get information out of seller regarding DVD availability or refund, still no refund."
2,gummo.. hmm. well..,"this movie was very very strange.. if killing cats, white trash, and a death metal/nursery rhyme sound track interests you.. go for it. otherwise save your hour and 1/2. this movie reinforces my faith in making movies myself... movies are supposted to be like real life.. but this one is just too real and boring."
5,GUMMO GUMMO GUMMO GUMMMMOOOO!!!,"A trip through the lives of people stuck in a going nowhere town that makes your mind scream in objection. Loved every minute of it and have watched it almost as many times as ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""!! Don't miss either of these!"
2,"sorry, white trash is not a freak show","uh, i used to be white trash, and i lived in a trailer park. that was where i grew up, and unlike this movie might suggest, most of the people TRY to act normal, even people who are white trash. Most people would rather fit the image of the ""norm"". I would not recommend this movie. It made me feel dirty and ill."
5,"Stupid, mindless, and attemps to shock.","If this director never gets to direct again it will be a blessing to us all. No plot, overboard characters with the sole intention to shock, and rampant stupidity. I didnt think it was ""arty"" watching little kids curse, drown cats, or shoot elderly people with pellet guns. Its just one pointless scene after another. And anyone that believes that there is a sizeable population of people like this is severly mistaken. This film is nothing more than trash trying to disquise itself as ""a portrait of the lower class."" Bull."
1,A movie thats not worth the time..,"I was told that this movie was going to be sick and twisted, and watched the movie to find out that the movie was stupid. Do not believe the hype, this movie will make you stupider if you watch it."
2,"It's rare when pretentiousness & white trash mix, but....","This feat is artfully accomplished in Gummo. While it's laudable that the film doesn't preach easy answers to difficult questions regarding the underbelly of white America, it's a wholly ineffectual romp into the muck, and it seems the only point of the film was to nauseate the audience. In case you think I'm squeamish, I thought that Kids was brilliant, and I'm as willing as anyone to sit through some pretty dark stuff, like Requiem For A Dream, Blue Velvet, Elephant Man, etc. But Gummo is different. This is merely a self-aggrandizing muck fest, and there is not one character that elicits even the smallest amount of sympathy from us. And the Rabbit-Boy addition was mere pretentious weirdness. It's really too bad, because I would have liked to like this."
1,Kiss me Guido is more socially accpetable in today's society,"The sheer intellectual, pinnacleness shows the sheer velocity of this movies integrety. The bacon on the wall enphisized the mamality of all the social parasites of everything that thrives today. I liked this movie a lot cause it shows life as it is portrayed in the mixed up society of today. The gay dwarf portrayed a man I know that surely cannot handle this melting pot theory portrayed in this feature motion picture. I award it 1 star and may God have mercy on Harmony's soul."
2,Almost the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"Listen up, all ye trying to drag your skateboards to Art Film 101: I too read the back of the box when I rented this, THAT IS AN ADVERTISEMENT. Just because you've been told that there isn't supposed to be a plot and this is supposed to be emulating a documentary doesn't make it true. Watch any documentary, you'll see some unification, some direction...Gummo feels like Harmony Korine dropped a camcorder in a trailer park and ran away.I gave it two stars because I sense that he saw something here; some of the images are powerful, and he did try to cross boundaries/push envelopes. I just think he fell short. However this is only his second film and he is under 30."
3,I dunno is it good or bad?,"I was basically perplexed, shocked, by this movie. I could not stop watching it. But the I cannot stop watching teletubbies, but I'm convinced that show has subliminal messages. I was horrified by tis movie as I have known people only a little less dememnted, I grew up in a town as ""special"" as in Gummo. So it appeals to me by familiarity but I am disgusted that people are like this. Having a sociological background, it was fascinated. I think I'd have to see it again to appreciate it. If you are one who likes to watch things that catch your attention due to disgust factor (a disgust factor based in rality, ont like a disgust facotr over slimy monsters) than this movie is for you. otherwise, do not rent it."
3,They couldn't have been acting...,"Add Xenia, Ohio to the list of towns I'll never visit. If you'd like to be disturbed, get this movie. Three stars for shock value alone. It's no ""Kids"", but 10x as warped."
4,strange,this is a dope movie. i have yet to meet another person who actually enjoyed it. anyway you should see it. it is entertaining in a very sick way. not as good as kids but still worth seeing.
1,Ok .....,"This movie was a horrible waste of film and time. Not only was the plot very hard to follow, the acting was beyond unwatchable. This movie was possibly one of the worst i've ever seen. It was so bad i could'nt finish it, I nearly passed out."
1,Anyone with a soul should find this movie horrible,"this movie was a horribile, disgusting collection of scenes featuring white trash doing white trash things: Pimping out your mentally retarded sister; Huffing glue; Killing stray cats and selling them to the chinese resturant; Deformed retarded gay midgets coming on to one other; and then random things like a kid running around with bunny ears on.....? everything in this movie is DIRTY (as in unsanitary..not explicit), POOR, and improperly worded.however if you enjoy being disgusted and appalled as i sometimes do then watch this movie, DONT BUY IT ...you wont want to watch it more than once. i'd rather watch this movie than something i've already seen 10 times.......but i'll never watch it againi took a shower when it was over, it made me sick."
1,it gets no worse,"I can't improve much on what's been said before. But I want to spare you the waste of time of this film.The rating of this film, in my opinion, reflects a group of people who are blindly lashing out at the garbage that is peddled on us by other sources. However, they have missed the fact that we don't want to replace garbage with bland business such as this. A movie devoid of character and content."
1,Spent more time fixin' than playin'!,I bought this set for my niece and within the first 5 minutes the charms fell off and the backing to the earing popped off! I spent so much time putting the darn pieces back on (rather than playing dress up) that I would tell people to stay away from this silly toy!
1,I wish I had read the other reviews before buying this!,"This was super cute, and my daughter loved getting it in the mail. However, it was a HUGE waste of money. Within an hour (or less) of having the jewelry, almost all of the charms fell off the bracelet and the earrings broke. My daughter was excited about the fun new accessories to go with her Cinderella costume for Halloween, and now she won't even be able to use most of the items. Save your money and pass on this one!"
4,old tv series,"I wasn't born when this show was on tv, but i have to admit it waspretty good. to bad it didn't last longer."
3,did not receive the book yet,"Dear SIr,We have still not received the book.Please check or refund my money asap."
3,Old Style Anime with Good Action!,"Video:*** ( aspect = 4:3, good transfer for a 20 year old classic. Art and animation is good but old style - not for those whose love is great japanese art/ animation ).Audio:** ( Dolby 2.0, nothing spectacular. Episodes' audio is kinda soft).Story:**** ( Good story line. That's what you should buy this series for. It helps if you're into huge robots thrashing one another! Scopedog fans would already own this, right? :) ).Extras:** ( Not much with the set, but it has an offer to get an extras DVD AFTER you purchase all 4 sets of the series ).Value:*** ( It started alright at $26 bucks, but seems like amazon is raising the price?! (currently at $30) 1st episode is free for downloading for those who wish to sample VOTOMS )."
3,it wasn't all that bad,"this is the first mrs. malory i've read, and i will definitely be reading the rest of the series.there are some good elements in the plot, which most mystery readers will at least suspect, but the author does a good job of misdirection and reversing the expected. there's a bit of irony in the conclusion, as well.the standard of writing is higher than in many mysteries lately--for instance, the author uses 'plethora' correctly on the first page, which can only be a good thing. more character development would have been better, as well some intereacton between mrs. malory and her students to demonstrate the supposed effect she has on them.still, despite it's failings as the perfect mystery, i enjoyed it and will read at least a couple more of the author's series before giving up."
5,A GREAT Book!,This is one of the best and most suspenseful books I have ever read in my entire life. It's filled with action and excitement. A nail bitter till the end!
1,No Way this ensemble would ever sell for $200.......,"And in my honest opinion it's not worth the $99 sale price and shipping costs of over $13. A person can buy a better quality bed in a bag at Walmart for $49 + tax. It barely covers my matress with sheets showing and the so called overstuffing in the comforter is a gross misrepresentation of what's actually between the surface and backing materials. Don't waste your money on this one. Oh well, one's never to old to learn a lesson and I learned a valuable one here."
5,Beautiful and stylish,I got this item quickly and efficiantly. It was exactly what I ordered and it was a great deal.
4,BED ENSEMBLE,"The bed ensemble is of good quality. It washes well. the only complaint I would have is that the comforter, although a king size, does not come far enough down on the sides to meet the bedskirt and the sheets are visible. I have a Cal-King bed, which is 6"" narrower than a King, so for a King size bed, it would barely go over the sides."
1,Can't say,"I never got the item! Instead, I got something flowery and pretty and the girl I'm dating laughed when she saw it in the box. I have yet to return it because I'm taking a bunch of class and don't yet have the time. But, once I do, I can't wait for my money back.If you ever get it, let me know what it's like . . . ."
4,Thornton's genius imagination,"From the moment you read the first page till you read the last word you will not be able to put the book down! Mr. Thornton's creative comparisons and almost real fantasies are sure to catch your attention. The book's extensive range of characters are described in an astonishing depth, through which the writer is able to create a picture in our minds of how Argentina was back in the Dirty War and how different people were affected by that. After reading this book you will most surely be wanting for more..."
4,IA Groups/sixth sense : ...,"Imagining Argentina is a novel that would be best described as unique, profound and very extordinary. It is focused on the topic of how imagination becomes the key element in survival and strength. It reflects the actions of a young man named Carlos Rueda who comes across a unique ability to percieve the fate and wherabouts of people who have been kidnapped by their corrupt government. Imagination is used as a tool of what appears to be war between the government and the citizens, which proves to show how powerful it really is. The power of imagination is not just something Carlos can do but is something that anyone can do in order to stay strong. The theme of the novel revolves around how imagination is an act of hope. Hope of never giving up. We enjoyed reading this novel very much. Lawrence Thornton writes with great creativity and imagination which makes the novel so intrigueing to read."
5,excellent guide to an excellent series,"As a fan of many tv scifi series, I am usually skeptical of unauthorized guides. They typically contain little behind the scenes information and are often riddled with factual errors. However, this one makes for a fun read and is crammed with trivia, minutiae and all sorts of wonderful details for the avid b5 nitpicker. My only complaint is that, because it was written before the 4th season had concluded, some of the speculation on the arc and certain of the series' many signs and portents now seems superfluous. If you want a guide you can page through while sitting in front of your tv, this one has everything."
5,Review by newly converted B5 fan in London,"Helped a lot. Having missed seasons 1-3 (""My name is Jon Elledge, and I used to watch Star Trek - transcript from Trekkers anonymous"") and been obsessed with B5 by the second episode of season 4, there was only a certain amout of info I could find in TV zone I bought the book to tell me what I'd missed, what exactly the shadows were etc. It was incredibly useful, with the plots, arc, background information all included, plus a few funny bits. I like Andy Lane's stuff anyway, having read two of his Doctor Who novels, and the book was the most useful thing I could find for getting the show straight in my mind. Buy it! (Is that too emphatic?)"
5,"If you only buy one B5 guide, then buy this!","This book is incredibly thorough. You get a synopsis for each of the A, B and C plots in every episode; information on all the various literary references, and how each episode ties in with the story arc. It's simply the best B5 guide currently available."
2,Don't waste your money on this.,"It's breaks no new ground. Instead, view the pages of The Lurker's Guide -- It's online, it's free, it's more comprehensive, doesn't contain as many errors, and doesn't set an agenda like this book does.The author says B5 is a great presentation, but 'disses' JMS and the series every chance he gets. I notice Lane is a SF writer himself -- maybe he is jealous of the world that JMS created and that he didn't think of something as good.There is a supplemental book that covers the episodes not contained in the first book. I bought both of them at the same time. Wish I had bought and read the first book first, then decided whether to buy the second. I wouldn't have bought the second.The only redeeming thing in this book is the section ""Ivanova's Life Lessons""."
5,the raw power of blues rock,"This CD was different from the other two Scott Holt albums. I like it a lot, but it is definitely more raw than the others. Not that it is a bad thing, actually I kind of like it that way. I think I had to regress through these three albums to truly appreciate Messin' With the Kid. I would have enjoyed it regardless, but for me, the appreciation came from the rough edges of this album as compared with the other two. It is like looking at someone's childhood photos...no matter how beautiful they are presently, there is something about them now that is more polished or hidden, something that is only evident when you can see them through comparison with an earlier self."
5,always great,consistantly first rate entertainment. any fan should seize the opportunity to see and hear scott holt band in person. great shows regularly at 3rd and lindsley in nashville.
2,not worth it! :(,"This boat is such a waist. It pulls to one side, no matter what we do to it. The life of the battery is a joke. It was just very disappointing. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone, ever. :("
1,Dagmar's Hot Pants inc(Dagmar and co),"I am not sure why Dagmar's Hot Pants inc (Dagmar and co) is not avaiable for sale on dvd or vhs in any region it seems,but it is available on Netflix instant streaming, and while it can be entertaining as far as for the adult contingent it is still a very dull movie,the graphics(artwork) are great though."
2,So-So,"When loser cop (Kevin Dillon), is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a missing co-ed, he unwittingly bites off more than he can chew -literally- when the missing co-ed turns out to be a vampire fledgling.Some elements of this film were cool. For instance, the vampire co-ed, and her friend, and the vampires henchmen were good-looking and well done. But some parts were just annoyingly bad. For instance: I hated the main hero. He was such a loser. I don't think he changed his t-shirt once during the entire film. He was such an alcoholic I was quite frankly surprised he didn't see vampires ALL the time. And the master vampire looked like a bad extra from Buffy.One of the few things I DID like about the film was the ending...Two stars for a sub-average vampire flick with a few good points. This film could've been saved with a better-written and more empathetic protagonist."
1,This is not so much a review as it is an opinion,I rented this movie and had a hard time sitting through to the end. The storyline was pretty lame and the acting was fair. It wasn't the worse vampire movie I have ever seen but I certainly wished I hadn't spent my money on it. There were so many inconsistencies throughout and I spent most of the movie focusing on them. I would recommend waiting until it came out on cable before watching it.
3,OK Vampire Flick,"There's been quite a few vampire movies realeased in the past few years. Some are good(Blade, John Carpenter's Vampires), some are bad(The Horror Within, American Vampire) but Vampires: Out for Blood falls right in the middle.It's got a decent B movie cast(Kevin Dillon & Lance Henricksen being the standouts) and a fairly typical but serviceable plotline(burned out cop searching for missing teen runs afoul of a group of vampires). Unfortunately nothing makes this film rise above the mass of other vampire films out there.If you're compelled to see every vampire movie available, then I doubt you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a new horror classic... keep looking. You're not gonna find it here."
4,Actually pretty darn good!,"Okay, this is a B movie at best by terms of its budget and special effects but its nothalf bad, the story was okay, but the real bonus of this movie is for fans of the show ENTOURAGE.You could almost say this is a Johnny Drama movie for real lol as Kevin's character in this movieis a LOT like his Entourage character, not to mention that he also hooks up with the delectableVanessa Angel as well! You could almost call this a lost Entourage episode called Johnny Drama's Vampires lol"
1,"It was the one armed vampire, I swear it!!!!","Kevin Dillon (The Doors, A Midnight Clear, No Escape) believes that vampires exist. His ex wife played by Vanessa Angel (Kingpin) is a novelist on vampires herself but she doesnt believe Dillon when he tells her. Crummy, poorly acted and sometimes interesting direction dont save this goblygook from breakin its fangs off. Lance Henriksen (Near Dark, The Terminator, Scream 3), Alex McArthur (Route 666, Kiss The Girls) and Jodi Lynn O'Keefe (Tv's Nash Bridges, Halloween H20, The Crow Salvation) also round out the wasted cast. Hey, I can tell you this...name one incredibly dumb lame horror movie Henriksen doesnt star in. Hey, Kevin Dillon was committed at the end of this movie because the people thought he was losing his marbles, well guess what when you watch this pile of plasma you'll be strapping yourself in"
5,awesome,"An underated Rolling Stones record in my opinion, totally enjoyable with some awesome songs and guitar shredding on this one."
1,it had a plasticy taste and weird consistancy,"I do absolutely hate this stuff. the consistency is way off and seems more like a paste than a condiment, and the tastes is the worst part of it. If you want a vegan mayo go for vegenaise or try making your own, don't waste your money on this."
3,"Hard ti tune it right, and not stay tune very long","It is a bot hard to get it tune right accurately, and after tuned, it is not staying there for very long. Maybe it is just me not very good at it yet."
2,Cheap Guitar,"It is what it is. Cheapest guitar I could find, and rightly so. Came with three plastic (nylon?) strings and 3 steel. It is my first guitar, so I'm just going by what the description of the guitar is on Amazon, which doesn't state this. Neck is chipped and painted over in parts. Otherwise a fine buy for a first guitar."
1,Lousy Product - less than one star,"This humidifier makes the house smell like an old locker room, musty and damp.ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND.I have used Hunter humidifier's before and not had this specific problem, although my last two had motor / fan problems after about a year.I give up on Hunter."
2,not durable,"I bought this humidifier because I was sick of using the paper wicks. The ""permanent"" wick does last, with occasional bleach treatments when the odor builds up, although it doesn't wick nearly as well as paper. However, the fan is terribly fragile. After two months of near continuous use over the winter, the fan broke down. The manufacturer replaced the fan and, the following winter, the fan broke down again after two months of use. Avoid this humidifier unless you only plan to run it a few hours a day. And it is VERY noisy on high speed."
3,Gives you quick outfit ideas...,"The book does give you quick outfit ideas, but nothing you didn't already know. It's probably safe to say that the books isn't worth it."
3,Average,"Nice illustrations, but the advice is really nothing new. Might be helpful to someone just starting out in the ""real world."""
1,For the Clueless Only,"This might be a good book for someone who has never seen a makeover show or has any sense of style or is 11 but for the rest of us? Not very useful. While the illustrations are cute, the tips are very obvious and common-sense driven (""horizontal stripes are bad for bathing suits!"" ""wash your face!"").If you're truly looking for insightful tips on dressing for your figure, spotting quality and always looking your best, I recommend The Pocket Stylist by Kendall Farr or Tim Gunn's Guide to Style."
3,Not enough information...,"This book is cute, and nicely written but doesn't offer enough information to assist the reader in making appropriate clothing choices, nor enough pictures/examples to use as a guide. So the reader is feeling no better off than before, I mean it's a start I guess...but for the little information that is provided it's not worth the price."
5,Mike Olfield - literally awesome concert!,"Mike Oldfield had already written most of his signature material by the time of this concert, and the youthful exuberance of all these musicians combined with great talent and Oldfield's innovation made this a wonderful musical experience. Yes, Oldfield's Tubular Bells reiterations and later compositions are different and great as well, but the Exposed concert is the classic and prime Oldfield sound. Thank you so very much, Mike! (The price for this DVD is outrageous nowadays but the music companies that control copyrights do not appear to care, so I will try to get legitimate issues elsewhere in the world and list at accessible prices)."
2,Product was received defective,"Two disc set with disc 1 having no audio. The video was typical late 70s quality, not bad for it's age. Disc 2 played fine with same video quality as disc 1, had audio."
4,can't get enough of it,"If you're like me, and can't get enough of the original album by Velvet Revolver, I think you'll love this. Each song is well done by the four performers, I actually find myself singing to the songs. I have a 5 disc changer at home, and have the original album in the first position followed by this tribute to Velvet Revolver. My ONLY complaint is that I kinda wished that they had someone play a little percussion for each song (ex: the string quartet tribute to guns n roses). But that's entirely okay. It's easy to make the rythem of each song. In fact, there is an awesome slide performed at the beginning of ""Headspace"" that I didn't know could be done by a violin. There's a treat at the end of the album, a song called .50 calliber, written by the director of the string quartet. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
1,?????,Just listening to these sound clips-I can't believe velvet revolver would release such an album. I can appreciate string quartets...but this is absolutely unbelievable. I wonder what would have made them release this? This is NOT rock at all. And four string instruments are no way going to capture the essence of Contraband. I am just in awe that this type of cd exists. No vocals or guitar or drums...Just a string quartet. This is SO not rock n roll....I HOPE the album that they are releasing soon is not going to end up like this...Talk about the downfall of rock n roll.
1,Seals fail,"I have had my Olympus for about 4 years. I am admittedly tough on cameras as I hike, canoe, and snorkel. I went swimming in about 6 feet of water off the coast of Panama and the seals failed, admitting water into the LCD part. It is dead now. A waterproof camera invites you to take your camera into the water. If the seals fail, your camera is toast. I cannot recommend the product. The camera does not fail at once, it takes time. Early reviews will not reflect this."
2,not really salt proof,"My camera just died. I've had it for a couple of years and it's just been an OK camera. I called it my point, shoot and pray camera because in bright light nothing can be seen on the screen, even when snorkeling. And it hasn't been that great snorkeling either. I have only used the camera snorkling on about 4 or 5 occasions and will admit that I hadn't had the seals replaced yearly as suggested. Didn't think it was necessary with such limited water use. Well last month I was floating in the Dead Sea in Jordan. The camera was dipped in the water a couple of times but throughly washed immediately upon returning to the beach. Guess this was a torture test in 30% salt content water because within two days the camera no longer worked. The memory card was runined and the camera will no longer work even with a new card and battery. This was surprising because when I did open the back a couple of days later nothing was visability damaged."
1,"Olympus ""Waterproof"" Not Really","This camera worked for a while, then got sand in it. Still under warranty, we returned it. Olympus sent us a new one. We took the new one to Brazil where we took underwater pictures in the Amazon River. A stop in Puerto Rico a few days later it seemed fine until I took underwater photos, then suddenly it went black. I thought it was the battery, so I took it home, and it turned out it had nothing to do with the battery. The so-called waterproof camera must have leaked. I do not recommend this camera. Olympus is charging a lot of money for something that only works through one and a half vacation shots."
1,poor picture quality,The quality of the pictures are not sharp compared to other digital cameras with similar pixel range. The waterproof feature compromised it a lot.
2,"Fun toy, not worth the money","I have owned this camera for 2 years. We bought it because we live a block from the beach, love to sail, snorkel and generally needed a good camera that could stand up to the elements.After only a year, the body showed significant corrosion; mind you we've been very careful with washing it after a day at the beach, etc. Now, after two years the seals appear to be bad. It is difficult to open the doors to down load photos, and there is no way I would submerge it.The photo quality was also mediocre, whether on land or under water. Taking photos while snorkeling was fun, but nearly impossible to capture fish unless it was extremely close to the surface. The water just filtered out too much light.Bottom line, this toy isn't worth the money."
5,Very good camara!,"I am a professional photographer, but when I go to Cancun every year I am so worried that my camara will get wet or damaged at the pool. This camara is perfect for that situation, it takes a nice picture and is very easy to use. Great for when we go snorkling!"
4,Great Camera!,"Nice size camera! Since I don't like to read manuals and I'm not technically savvy, what I liked most about the camera is that it's very user friendly. Easy to figure out without any reading. Video works great...went whitewater rafting and took some cool pictures. Purchased a mini tripod and the timer is simple to set and takes great pictures. So far the hardest thing is downloading the pictures to the cd that it came with. But I just need to spend time using all the features to the program. I would recommend if you're doing a lot of video recording or recording for long periods of time, to buy an extra battery."
2,Mediocre at best,"We purchased this camera for our honeymoon in Hawaii, and used it on 5 or 6 snorkeling/boating trips. In general the results were very disappointing. The camera is rugged enough to stand up to drops and salt water, but picture quality is poor in my opinion. It is also very slow to take pictures, which made it nearly impossible to catch photos of fish, sea turtles, etc.Outside of the water, the picture quality is equally disappointing. I am sticking with my 3-year old Canon Digital Elph for normal usage and will just rent a digital camaera for underwater use."
2,If you want good results. try something else.,I bought this camera because of one unique function-- water proof (that's the reason I give it 2 *.) I didn't expect the image quality was that POOR. Put it this way. My 7 yrs old 3mp olympus C3030 took MUCH better pictures than this modern piece of S**t. 'Nuff said.
1,"Waterproof new, Yes. Waterproof after dropping, No","When I bought this camera in March I was excited for it. Drop proof, waterproof, crush resistant? Sweet! I'm pretty tough on pretty much all of my stuff so I figured this would be the greatest camera ever, I was disappointed. i dropped it a couple of times on vacation, only from pants pocket height or table height and figured it would be ok, nope. It still took pictures, but as soon as I went back into the ocean it stopped working properly. The scene mode stopped and each time I want to go from looking at the pictures I have taken back to taking pictures, I have to restart the camera. Bottom line, if you are going to buy this camera, definately get the extended warrenty on it, chances are if you are at all near as rough on it as I was, it's going to break."
4,Good But scratches easily,"I love this camera for taking wakeboarding on my boat. So far I noticed that the ""allowed light"" setting is by far the best for most photos as the flash seems a little too bright. The only down side to this camera is there is no recessed lens at all, so the first time i took this camera on my boat, the LCD lens got really scratched (which is a huge dissapointment). All in all though, great camera"
5,Great Camera,"Bought this camera for a trip to Disney World...What a great purchase!!!! Waterproof, shockproof, easy to use, small and compact for roaming Disney without alot of bulk like our previous camera, takes great pics, it couldn't have been more perfect. The video looks very ""digital"" and the zoom could be a bit better but overall I would give this camera a 5 star rating."
5,Bullet Proof Camera,"I bought this for my 5 year old son because in previous reviews it was described as being a very tough little camera that is easy, (like five year old easy), to use. They were right, its built like a tank and my son loves it and he will now leave my expensive phone alone when he wants to take a picture. Perfect!!!!"
4,pretty good,it takes a while to learn the various settings.(I actually have to read the booklet!!) Since the lens does not telescope out it is very easy to get shadows from your hand if they come in the peripheral vision of the lens.I damaged my previous camera when apple juice turned over in the baby bag.....so the security of water proof is great as well as my baby can get his hands on the camera without my usual fears.
4,I give this 4 stars but......,"This camera is truly versatile. We bought it before a trip to Hawaii & took it snorkeling. It took great photos, but the screen is dim and difficult to view in bright light or under water. In addition, the movie mode is extremely short- 20 seconds and I can't figure out how to add a new movie or continue. It seems to lock up after the 20 seconds. On the plus side, this camera has many cool modes with pictures on the screen of what you're getting before you take the picture. I added the 2 GB card & have well over 1000 photos with room to spare. The photos are easy to download via a supplied USB cable. All in all I think this is a good little camera & pretty durable with the exception of the above noted quirks."
2,"water proof, shock proof but terrible picture quality","I took this to Hawaii with my fiance, she had an older sony point and shoot and her photos blew my cameras out the water, great for taking in the ocean but next time ill just get a better camera with an underwater housing"
5,PERFECT little camera,"After using this camera (Olympus 770SW) for a few weeks I can say it suits my needs perfectly. The places I've wanted to have a camera haven't always been the best places to take a camera like boating, fishing, kayaking and most anywhere else outdoors in anything less than perfect weather. Most of the time I just left my cameras at home for fear of damaging them. I considered getting a waterproof housing for my Canon A85 but couldn't justify the cost for an aging lower resolution camera not to mention it would then be the size and weight of a brick. I don't know why anyone would consider any other point and shoot camera since this one will do everything any other camera will do but definitely not vice versa! It's VERY small, makes great photos, features high resolution, has a huge LCD screen, has great battery life, is waterproof, shock resistant and crushproof...why WOULDN'T you buy it??"
5,Super Camera,"This camera is truly wonderful. I finally have something that is rugged enough to go diving, in the air and in the ocean, I don't worry about taking it out on rugged event, and it's small enough to fit into a pocket for when I go out with friends. This a very versatile product. My only complaint is that to get to the shooting and movie modes you have to go through a menu and select one, but I suppose that's the price you pay for waterproofing."
1,There is no reason to buy this camera,"By coincidence, my brother and I both bought this camera. Initially we congratulated ourselves for making such a wise buy independently. Actually we were both saps who fell for the unrealized promises of the marketing for this device. We have been comparing photos and generally this camera takes poor pictures at best. If you are in bright daylight it's fine, but in even remotely dim lighting the pictures absolutely stink. Also, the focus is twitchy. You have to learn the strange focus attributes of the camera to get a decent shot and even then you have a 50% chance of being out of focus.I haven't taken this camera underwater but after learning the Olympus policy is to require a gasket refit ever year at over $100 per refit, I don't think I'll be doing that.Also the battery life is horrible.It seems like a super safe buy because of all the shock and water proofing, but in the end you will be sorry you bought this, just like my brother and I are."
4,Good enough...,"I have not tested many products, but compared to a similar HP digital camera (without being weather proof, shock proof, etc.) I am very happy. The picture quality is good, and the LCD is much better than the HP. The only hangup is that in the default settings all of the pictures came out a little blurry. I was a little upset that a 7.1 megapixel camera was unable to produce a quality 8x10 picture."
1,Product failed us on a once in a lifetime vacation,"Would not recommend buying this camera! We purchased this camera specifically for a vacation to Hawaii. The third time we used this camera (in only a few feet of water) it leaked. We called Olympus customer service from Hawaii to try to get a camera loan or replacement for the remainder of our trip with no success. In fact, the customer service agent told us they had received many back because of leaks. Now we have a bad camera, memory card, case and skin and nothing but frustration dealing with Olympus. Extremely disappointed in this product and Olympus."
4,Amazing little camera!!!,"I bought this camera for a recent trip to Cancun Mexico. I also have a Nikon D200, but wanted something that I could carry around in my pocket. I ended up going scuba diving - and, this camera took amazingly clear photos at 30 foot depths. I know that it says it will, but I was a little hesitant to jump into the ocean with it and without some kind of waterproof casing. Well, everything worked out even better than expected. I have no complaints...excellent point and shoot camera, great for sporting events, families with kids, etc."
1,"Great idea, poor durability","I really enjoyed the flexibility of this camera - or at least the promise of this camera. Decent photos, no worries about getting wet or damage from minor drops. I used this for vacation including underwater photos. It's great to snorkel without lugging around a big waterproof case. Unfortunately, the fun didn't last very long. After my 2nd vaction, the camera stopped working. Water had leaked into the seal and corroded the battery and memory card connections. Camera doesn't work at all. Unfortunately, I had another bad experience recently with a different Olympus camera (not waterproof and not exposed to water) breaking after about a year. I don't know if this is bad design or bad quality. But, I know I won't be buying any other Olympus cameras."
2,leaked while snorkeling: camera ruined,"I've had this camera for 1 1/2 years, and until recently it functioned well. Very lightweight, good for trips, bad weather, took reasonable pictures. But while I was just on an extended snorkeling and kayaking trip, the camera leaked water (battery compartment WAS closed) and is ruined now. Rust inside, and it won't turn on. I never went below 10 feet deep (the limit for my ability to free dive) and the camera is rated to 33 feet.I've returned the camera to Olympus for a repair (flat fee of $103 no matter what they find wrong with it) and hope it lasts longer this time. But I'm very disappointed, overall, and can't recommend the camera for prolonged use in the water."
2,Point and Pray,"Poor latch on battery compartment will eventually admit water, ruining the camera. Lack of a viewfinder forces you to rely on the LCD screen which washes out completely in sunlight."
4,"So far, So Good","We purchased this camera to send to our son who is serving in Afghanistan. We looked for the features that makes this rugged and dependable under less than ideal conditions. There are not a lot of economical and small cameras with these features.He has sent a few pictures via email and they are very good.The camera takes a memory card different from our other cameras that use an SD card. That makes the Olympus a little unique but I was able to find an inexpensive 2gb memory card to send with it. Thus far, it seems to be working as advertised. It is easy to carry and has an image stabilization feature that keeps the pictures sharp. Perhaps the next 12 months or so will give us a better idea of how it holds up to adverse conditions."
5,Great Camera,"This is a great camera to use anywhere and anytime-snowboarding, scuba diving and pics of fireworks. Compact size, great pictures, easy to use"
4,olympus stylus 770sw 7.1,"I love this camera! I have 2 little girls and they distroy camaras! One in the toilet, one in the sand, one juice all over it. I've had the olympus for a month now, and it still is going! (dropped in kiddie pool, thrown from deck!) The pictures are quite good. I love it, and would recomend it."
2,Stay away from extended salt water exposure,"I purchased this camera for use outdoors and in the ocean. For the most part it held up, I dropped it a couple times, had it out in the rain, used it whole snorkeling. However, after using it less than 10 times snorkeling in the ocean (I would soak in fresh water following the instruction after snorkeling) the camera shut down. I realized water had entered the camera because the seals failed. I didn't dive more that 20 feet deep. I also noticed additional corrotion on various parts of the camera. So now I need to return it, but have zero faith the new camera will perform any differently. I may consider purchasing a waterproof cover for the camera when I dive in the ocean, not sure if they make one though. Another complaint is the slow picture speed. Other than that, it is rugged, and would suit someone who wants to throw a camera in the backpack on their next hike.I warn against using this as a diving camera or surf camera."
1,Horrible Experience!!?!!,"I read all the reviews before I chose to buy this camera. Having three kids, a shockproof and waterproof camera sounded unbelievable and perfect for me. At first it was great. The pictures came out great and the camera was very user friendly. I love to take pictures and had the camera in my purse at all times to never miss a golden opportunity of the perfect picture. Then after using it one day with no problems, two days later when I went to use it again and the camera would not stay on. I tried a new battery, but still nothing. So much for this camera, its was supposed to be shockproof and waterproof yet it broke in its case inside of my purse."
3,Good value,"I am a little disappointed in this camera. The LCD window is impossible to see in the bright sun.Is there any other time to use an under water camera? If you are swimming and trying to take a picture you have no idea what the camera sees. Your working blind . Theres no viewfinder to look through. I can't recall another camera without this simple feature. Otherwise ,I am satisfied wiht this camera. Maybe I can learn to use it as time goes by."
4,770sw,"Great camera. Very sturdy yet small enough to put in your pocket. I'm an avid mountaineer, fisherman, and rafter. this camera gets more use out of any camera ever. You can take pictures of the fish under water!The cons are:-no remote control-no protection for the LCD screen-limited zoom-not a great wide angle either"
3,It worked great... 'till the end of the vacation.,"I reciently purchased this camera from Amazon.com(great price) and took it to Jamaica. It is such a cool experience diving into water with a camera and taking very unique pictures. The camera worked great for the entire 6 days my wife and I were on vacation until it stopped working completely on the last day. We took the camera snorkeling several times for close to an hour. Each time, I rinsed off the camera with fresh water, opened the battery case and removed small beads of water, and left the case open to dry completely.I am a bit dissappointed in the waterproof performance of this camera, however it did take great pics when it was working. Amazon.com was great about taking the product back and giving me a full refund, and I will try another 770sw. This time, perhaps I will be more carefull and dilligent about caring for it for use under water. Hopefully it will perform better in the future."
5,A Law Student's Best Friend,"I tab everything. No joke. I tab my textbooks, my outlines, my supplements... I even tab my writing notebook. It's kind of crazy. This is the cheapest deal I've found on this particular pack of tabs - more than a dollar cheaper than at Sam's Club and without the need to drive there and pick it up myself. Which, I know, makes me sound lazy. But during finals time, man, you gotta spend as much time as possible studying!"
2,To transparent,"These are too transparent if writing something on them for notes. Ok for marking a page, other than no, I don't recommend."
3,Just okay,These are not as colorful as other post its have been. I bought this package in hopesof a good deal but I dislike them and wish I had bought something different.
5,Love This Book,"I got my copy of Homeschooling, The Teen Years and read it through immediately. It was such an encouragement. Although we have been homeschooling for more than five years, sometimes I get cold feet and fear that we are not doing enough. Cafi's book points out the many ways we educate our kids every day and gives suggestions for new things to try. I highly recommend this book to people who are considering homeschooling their teens, and especially to those who are already doing it!"
4,"Help, I have a teenager","This is a nice, quick read. However, it does seem to be more geared toward the first-time homeschoolers, rather than for someone who has homeschooled for several years."
2,"Outdated, not for experienced homeschoolers","This book is already outdated, as recent further advances in internet and digital technology render this book almost obsolete. It was published before online virtual academies were available, before smart phones, before YouTube, etc. Many of the websites suggested are outdated. I hope the author has the time and support to produce an updated edition. It also does not include a section on the numerous companies that offer accredited programs and diplomas (Calvert, K12, Connections, American School, etc.) The book also spends most of the time introducing the reader to the concept of homeschooling and giving very general advice which makes this book not geared towards seasoned homeschoolers. Finally, I picked up this book hoping that there would be chapters addressing how to navigate the change in parent-child relationship dynamics in adolescence and beyond but there was absolutely nothing about this."
2,More of a survey result book,"Not very happy with this book. I bought it on recommendation from a friend. It was more about results of surveys taken from homeschooling families than giving advice on homeschooling. Being that I am new to homeschooling, I am looking for ways that will be helpful for me and my son's success. A good book but however, it did not provide me with what I was looking for."
3,A review of a bug collection 3,"A Review of Max Lucado's Hermie & FriendsThis video proves that bugs have a lot more to do than invade picnics, houses, and bite unsuspecting children. The little bugs in this collection of dvd's deal with bickering, fighting, naughty behavior, and lack of praying. On the out set, I must say that the video is quality, has vibrant colors, and cute voices. However, the content is not very good. It seems like the lessons are a bit forced, and not natural to the story line. Also, I know it is trying to prove a point, but I really don't want to show my children bickering on a regular basis. They thus far don't have that problem, and I don't want it modeled to them constantly. All that to say is, I don't quite know what is missing with so many of these Christian dvd's today. I guess everyone can't be veggie tales. All in all I would not say don't borrow it from a friend to see if it is for you, but I would say, don't buy it quite"
1,Did not work,"I was very excited about purchasing this dvd for my preschool, but unfortunately the dvd did not play at all. I put it in the dvd player and it read nothing.Very disappointed!"
5,This Book Is Something Special,"This book is something really special -- it took my breath away with its keen insights, new analyses, and helpful suggestions for every parent of every adolescent. In brief, the substance is outstanding. I've parented my 3.5 children through adolescence (one is only half-way there), and I promise that what this offers readers is truly helpful . . . brilliant actually, and that the methods suggested will truly work. The writing is clear and direct, funny, reasonable, and chock-o-block with legitimate examples of situations and genuine dialogue. The authors have created a new approach to an age-old problem, one that every parent faces, and for which most parents have sought some guidance. My own little home library has quite a section devoted to adolescents, like ""How to talk so your teenager will listen,"" and ""The angry teenager,"" and a few others with ""teen"" or ""adolescent"" in the title. This is the best book I've read, by far."
3,too intellectual for your average parent,"I ordered this book as a parent of one teen and one pre-teen, but also as a mental health therapist who works daily with parents of difficult teens. The three main rules are a great starting point and the ""seven things"" are definitely true. The ""how to talk to them anyway"" leaves me skeptical in that many of the scripts seem more like lectures and are too technical to expect your average parent to be able to replicate.This book would definitely be helpful to a more ""intellectual"" minded individual, but for the parents with a high school education or less ""How to Talk so Your Kids will Listen and Listen so your Kids will Talk"" is a better match."
4,Tool for parents of teenagers,This provided a great tool to ease the angst of subjects difficult to talk about!
2,too small,"these are a waste of money. make sure to get the large towels. these wont be used long, and are thin too. buy the large, fluffy ones, you will use them for a long time."
3,My review,A nice overall lamp but I don't like the size of the lamp head. It is too large and the picture does not show it.
4,Space-age Timepiece...?,"Back in Time to the Future:This ""2001"" watch really is different. I just received mine and admit, it looks like no other watch. But please, shop around. Do not pay the $1100 plus MSRP. I paid around $850 for mine.Drawbacks, irreversible band sizing.(BE CAREFUL HERE!!)No second hand on main watch face!No second or minute hands on three small dials.Poor instructional booklet for setting etc:Positives: As stated, looks great and is collectible. Well made.Clasp situation alluded to can be remedied by simply tweeking it with pliers.(Be careful here too)It woulda been nice to have a digital face also, afterall, it IS suppose to be futuristic(it WAS in 1968!!) And, it is a tad pricey, what???An Owner"
2,"Too ""Modern""","As a big Del Reeves fan, I was very disappointed with this CD. I like the original instrumentation whereas in the remastering of this CD it definitely has the new ""modern"" sound, including Del's rendition of most of the songs. Sorry, but the ""old"" Del is much much better."
1,adapter,ad was not clear on plug. bought it a year ago and can not use it. tried to sell it and nobody interested to buy it. now i am out $30.00 with a uselees product
1,Boring,"Bought this book for my homeschooler prior to the last election, but it was boring. We found better material for free online at Time Magazine."
3,Doesn't answer most important question,"Hey, a handy little book for kids, but I think that it neglects to explain to them why they can't vote. It has a small section that says ""When can I vote?"". It would have been good if it would have been ""Why can't I vote"", although there would be no good reason, so I'm sure that's why they forgot this question.Oops! Also, I was forced to mention that I was over 13 in the little checkbox. Neat. Way to promote rights of the people."
4,Made Me laugh,"I liked reading the early stuff, as well as the new stuff. The book is short (as are all comic collections) and I read it in a day, but I just couldn't put it down. The only complant I have is, they should be numbered so you can get them in order, but you can take the time to figure it out by date, thats no problem!"
5,Excellent,"This is one of my favorite strips. It is rare that a comic like this comes along with both great dialogue and awesome artwork. Plus, unlike most of the cookie-cutter, bland characters populating the comics pages these days, Bucky and Satchel have well-defined, original personalities. This book is great because it lets you see how the strip started and gives you the first six to eight months of the strip."
4,"Meet ""Get Fuzzy"" - you will never regret it.","I couldn't believe the comic strip. I actually laughed out loud at Bucky, Satchel and Rob's irrepressible antics. The comic strip was the first thing I looked at when I opened the paper in the morning.Then - while browsing at a book store - I found it . . .""Get Fuzzy: The Dog is Not a Toy (House Rule #4),"" Darby Conley's first book. Yes Virginia. . .there is a Santa Claus!If you haven't met Bucky, Satchel and Rob yet, this book is a great introduction to the threesome. Bucky the cat is so irritating, he's lovable. Satchel, the mixed breed canine, has a heart of gold and gives everyone - even Bucky - the benefit of the doubt. Their human, Rob, is the glue that holds everything together.In no time at all you'll be believing the three are real and you'll wish they lived next door to you. Don't miss this opportunity to laugh out loud."
4,Pretty funny,"This book was pretty funny. It's obviously an older book as I have read a lot of the comics in 'Get Fuzzy', but it was still pretty damn funny. Bucky's the best"
5,An intellectual's Garfield and Odie,"""Get Fuzzy"" fills that dreadful void left by the departure of ""Bloom County"" and ""Calvin & Hobbes"". Darby Conley imagines a world with a scheming, plotting cat and a hapless, neurotic dog. Overseeing the menagerie is Rob, an adman who combines milder versions of the first two archetypal characters. It is a delight. It is full of wonderful scenarios and huge belly laughs. My wife and I have adopted nomenclature from the strip and say things like, ""That was a Bucky remark."" or ""I did a Satchel today."" A most enjoyable read that doesn't talk down to or pander to its readers. An intellectual's Garfield and Odie."
5,A Classic!,I loved this book and I bought it for my nephews who desperately needed a break from bad comic strips and it's their new favorite comic now!
5,Hilarious!,"This book is simply funny. If you own a cat you can really compare bucky to one and Satchel to a dog. The differences between them if really funny. Buy the book, it rocks!"
4,Wow...great comic,"It's amazing what ""Get Fuzzy"" does with its few characters and limited setting. It's not like other comic strips that feel they have to add new characters whenever they run out of material. ""Get Fuzzy"" always has something new, something to think about. The characterization is great. A lot of people say that Bucky and Satchel remind them of their pets....they remind me of people I know. It's also refreshing to have a comic strip that doesn't feel it has to be laugh-out-loud funny every day. ""Get Fuzzy"" touches something inside of you, and that's enough."
1,Criminal Intent!,"It is so much a crime that Conley has created this disappointing charade of a comic. To sum things up, all one has to say is that it smells so bad of previouse strips, mainly of Bloom County and Garfield, that if one looks long enough he can see Opus in Satchel and Steve Dallas in Rob (but only in drawing style, not in humor). How ironic that his name is Rob, for all Conley did is ""rob"" other talented comic writers of their original ideas. Hopefully this strip will disappear before any lawsuits are brought onto Conley, at least for his sake."
5,THE BEST,"Totally laughed my head off! What a great compilation! This cartoonist is sick, twisted and genius! I LOVE BUCKY!! What a guy... I mean cat."
5,The Dog Is Not A Toy: House Rule #4,"We have four cats, sixteen paws and all of them have a bit of Bucky in 'em.We can't imagine that Darby doesn't have any animal companions because he's got it down to a T.This is an extraordinary work, the best thing that has happened since Bloom County!Keep them comin'!"
5,Great Book,This is one of the best humor books I have read. It keeps the reader entertained through the whole book. If you are considering buying it. I suggest that you do.
5,this book is timeless!,I've been waiting for a Get Fuzzy book forever! it's hilarius. you don't have to own a cat & a dog to enjoy it. i've looked at it several times; now i've written down my favorite page numbers for quick viewing! this book is a must buy. my girlfriends birthday gifts are already on their way. thanks Darby Conley!
5,Bucky and Satchel really grow on you!,"I did not care much for ""Get Fuzzy"" when it first appeared in my Sunday newspaper; the strips seemed disjointed, and I just didn't ""get"" the humor. Then, upon reading my daily ""Dilbert"" I saw that Scott Adams recommended ""Get Fuzzy"" for whatever reason, so I decided to give it a try on a daily basis. It was in reading the strips regularly that the personalities of Robbo and his pets really started to flesh out. Now that I have the book, I'm able to see all that I was missing in just reading the Sunday strip.If you've just ""sort of"" enjoyed this strip in your paper or online, then this book really pulls it all together. I was extremely pleased to learn the origins of ""Smacky"", Bucky's best friend in the whole wide world. If you're a big fan of the strip, then you probably already have the book, so I'm preaching to the choir.All-in-all: very funny."
1,"GIVE IT UP,PLEASE","WHEN OH WHEN ARE THESE GUYS GONNA GET THE HINT THAT THE PARTYS LONG LONG OVER WITH. THE BEATLES KNEW THEY COULDN'T CONTINUE BUT LEFT THE STAGE ON TOP WITH SOME OF THERE FINEST WORK,WHY CAN'T THESE GUYS GET THE MESSAGE? DIRTY WORK IS HARDLY WORTH TALKING ABOUT.THESE GUYS REGROUP EVERY COUPLE YEARS, PUT OUT A TERRIBLE ALBUM, AND THEY CALL THEMSELVES A BAND? BRIAN JONES,WHERE ARE YOU?"
5,I enjoyed this one!,"There are two albums from 1986 that get negative reviews which I can't understand - Bob Dylan's ""Knocked Out Loaded"" and this one! I think both are very good and thoroughly enjoyed them! As far as ""Dirty Work"" goes - I liked all the songs except for maybe ""Hold Back"" which was still okay. I liked Keith Richards singing and think he should sing on more songs than he does! So this was suprisingly really good - wasn't expecting much from all the negative comments - and glad I wasn't because that made me be blown away even more! These ears of mine didn't detect any lack of focus or energy like some of the reviews say - and in my opinion this is better than ""Emotional Rescue"" and ""Undercover"" - I would actually go as far as to say this is some of the best rock n' roll from the 1980's! Definitely recommended!"
2,It's a dirty job...,"The cover shot of the band is about all you need to know about the music contained within: disinterested and dated. But it's not as horrible as most have said; I can safely say 'Dirty Work' is miles better than the disastrous 'Undercover'. The first and last tunes on 'Dirty Work' are its best, 'One Hit to the Body' and 'Sleep Tonight'. The middle is where it goes head-shakingly off track. 'Too Rude' sounds like a UB40 remake, with an annoying drum reverb effect, and 'Winning Ugly' will have you racing for the 'next' key on your player. The rest of the songs range from obnoxious to simply forgettable. The sound quality is your typical early CD from the 80's, but as you might have figured out, this album deserves to be forgotten rather than remastered."
1,Absolute Garbage,"Have always been a Rolling Stones fan. This album is dated garbage. If they weren't the Rolling Stones, none of this album would have charted, let alone gotten any radio play. It's obvious they hate each other and what they are doing. Skip it."
3,Not Bad For A Distracted Effort,"Though Mick was absent from much of the sessions to work on his own solo album and Keith and Ronnie did the bulk of the work, Dirty Work is quite underrated. Sure, the synthesizer sounds extremely dated, but ""Fight"" is raw and memorable, ""Too Rude"" is a lovely Keith/Jimmy Cliff duet, Keith's ""Sleep Tonight"" is a warm invitation to wintertime clinical depression, and ""Harlem Shuffle"" of course glides along nicely and was a U.S. #4. It sounds as if they could have been on the verge of integrating the '80s sound to the Stones brand of grittiness if they hadn't been at each others throats, disbanded for three years, and truly gone ""Back To Zero."""
3,tough love,"No Sticky Fingers, but much more of what the Stones are all about than the VH-1 ""feel good"" tripe that follows. Concise and punishing, unlike the bloated, mild CD-era embarrassments. Mick screams his way through the entire album--thrilling, if at times comical. He crosses himself up so much that it's unclear if he's spewing at girls, Keef, or himself. Great guitars: inventive and gnarly.'It's beginning to make me angry/I'm beginning to hate you/You're a user/you're a user/I hate you.'"
2,Judge it by the cover,It sounds as bad as the cover looks- mostly. There are a few very good songs. That's all you need to know.
2,Not so good.,"Keith Richards' wife said about this album that ""Keith had a lot of anger then."" (Keith was angry because Mick was spending so much time on his first solo album). Well, that's what comes across on this album...anger. It is just over-the-top hard rock. People say the Stones are a hard rocking band...and they are...but in there is usually a lot of SUBTLETY. This album has no subtlety whatsoever. It's just noise. I do like HARLEM SHUFFLE and HAD IT WITH YOU."
2,They hit a low point here..,"I'm a huge Stones fan and I love most of their work. But after hearing this I have to wonder, what were they thinking??"
2,pass,"This is two dimensional rock, that lacks the depth of the Stones usual stuff. When I first heard this album I worried that the Stones had changed their sound for good. But when ""Steel Wheels"" came out, I was relieved to hear the Stones return to form. And to address the comment two reviews down that this is Charlie's best album up to the end...well, believe it or not, Ron Wood, not Charlie Watts, plays the drums on the last Keith ballad, ""Sleep Tonight"". Charlie was too floored with heroin/amphetamine addiction at the time to work on the song. And, personally, the song shows the lack of Charlie (the same way the Beatles ""The Ballad of John and Yoko"" misses it somehow because Paul, and not Ringo, was drumming). Luckily for us all, Charlie cleaned up. But a bad Stones album is better than most other groups' best album...."
4,stronger guitar sounds than previous,"Yeah sure it was an angry album as Undercover was gory and say Black and Blue was funky ,but out of this comes new directions and with the Stones playing and writing as strong as ever these periods in hindsight become interesting listening,especially if you retro mid 80s Rock you will discover how mundane a lot of it was.I think Lillywhite's production on this was to grease the Stone's sound around the then Heavy Metal sounds and if one examines this to the present day,what we have now is a Rolling Stones that is capable of performing an entirity of blues sounds, Sixties R""n""B, Seventies swagger, Eighties(???)and nineties hybrid retrophonic. All up Dirty Work is a great sound with a filthy vibe!"
2,Landmark...,"Originally I was going to mark ""Black and Blue"" as the low point in the Rolling Stones catalogue...until I remembered this one! Has the be the lowest musical points in their stellar catalogue. ""One Hit"" is good, but the rest..oh my...If you want to hear this Rock group visit ""Let it Bleed"" or ""Exile on Main Street""."
3,Weak effort from a great band.,"This is one of the weakest Stones' albums. SLEEP TONIGHT & DIRTY WORK are classic Stones songs, but the rest is mediocre at best. ONE HIT (TO THE BODY) and HARLEM SHUFFLE are memorable."
2,their worst,"I love the Stones....always have, always will...but for many reasons outlined in all these reviews, by far their worst album...production is way to 80's...writing is lacking....you want good 80's stones? Tattoo you, Undercover (underated CD see my review) and Steel Wheels....for the casual fan avoid this....plus if there are unreleased tracks then they should release an expanded edition...maybe it will make the review a three star :)"
1,2009 Remaster.,I'll give the Stones credit for making one of the most dated album covers ever even more garish and vomit inducing.
3,Documentary,"That. Is which there is. I think all lover of good music, are not allowed miss this performance. This is a documentary about legendary Claudio Arrau. There is not good Technical Quality in this DVD. The sound of orchestra seemed like muffled. Lighting on the stage is poor. There is not beautiful scenery. There are not good look Nordic peoples to be seen. Of course, this DVD is better to be heard. To me it is not a waste of money because for while is the only way appreciate his fingers (Claudio Arrau) floating lightly on the piano keyboard performing the Beethoven Piano Concerto number five. So, there is nothing to see? If you answered yes, you missed. There is Claudio Arrau."
4,Hard rocking rock-a-billy...,"All recorded live at the 1999 Hootenanny Festival at Oak Canyon Ranch, CA. It is basically all hard rocking rock-a-billy bands such as Reverend Horton Heat, Derailers, Mike Ness, Royal Crown Revue, Deke Dickerson, Dave Alvin, Lee Rocker, Amazing Crowns, Paladins and others I never heard of. Pretty cool."
3,If Kevin Smith wrote Horror Movies...,"I didn't think the movie was as bad as some of the others, however it was far from great. The interesting thing about this movie was that there was a lot of talking. I was thinking during the first half that if Kevin Smith wrote a horror movie, it might be like this one.Unfortunately, the conversation wasn't nearly as interesting as what you might find in a Kevin Smith movie. The movie didn't pick up speed until the last ten minutes. I'm not surprised many found it boring.I thought the sound was fantastic, and they did a great job of creating a creepy mood. It was interesting that the first half of the movie followed the 3 guys and the second half followed the 2 girls. Normally I would have expected more switching between the two stories.With horror movies, it's hard to walk the balance of explaining what is going on while still leaving plenty of room for interpertation. This movie left a lot for interpertation, but didn't give enough answers."
3,good movie.,"I give this 3 stars while not great it is good. The acting I felt was very good the plot /story was also good. The effects good. So basically its a good movie nothing great not going to get cult status or become a classic but it was good and worth a viewing. I know I would pay no more than $13 or so for this flick. Me personally wouldnt buy the flick for that much while good just not in my relm.Maybe if it was any where from $5 -$10 then yes other words no. And not for no reason just nothing im really into, but like I said a good =viewing and not dissapointed. Rent b4 you buy just my opinion."
2,SWAMPED,"Although set in the usually eerie swamplands of Louisiana, EVIL REMAINS doesn't go too far in advancing the tired cursed land story. A group of students venture off to a supposedly cursed plantation to disprove the myth of it being cursed. Seems twenty years earlier, an abused boy murdered his sadistic father and passive mother, but his body was never recovered. (Hint, hint). The movie tries to achieve some atmospheric chills and its cast is more than capable, but it's too talky and under-directed to provide true chills."
2,"Lots of potential, not a lot of substance.","This movie starts out, like most, with a pretty good plot, though it soon deteriorates into just another long, dragged out borefest. For example, you'll get annoyed with the never-ending card game, as well as the painfully tedious conversations between characters who become possessed (ala The Shining), most notably between Estella Warren's character and her on-screen girlfriend as they hide out (I won't give away more than that, in the event you actually want to see this one). On the positive side, Estella Warren's acting is actually pretty good (better than The Planet of the Apes, anyway). In sum, though, I wouldn't recommend this one.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."
2,Is this the Brokeback Mountain of Slasher flicks?,"Not Bad Not Great. Ok lets start off with a group of good looking kids including a hotter then donut grease lesbian couple with my favorite buck toothed actress Estella Warren and some other girl with dreads. We also have the 2 studs that are petting each other and looking longly into each others eyes, not to worry though homophobes nothing happens at all between any one.Witch to me is a missed opportunity with theses two young ladies, I mean damn this is a slasher flick and heck this is a new idea for the genre.Now lets talk about the cover of the dvd witch has some pretty blond girl that does not seem to be in the movie. Look up Trespassing to see the original cover art.Who is the dude with the red-eyes or what do's the bloody sickle have to do with this flick?Not bad used for $3.00 bucks off Amazon with a great cast and a weak plot."
1,Defective and dangerous,"The price was great, so I recently purchased two of these and both were defective. The three way female connection contacts were improperly molded. The connections sparked and were intermittent even when plugging in low power items such as lights. The contacts heated rapidly at the plug in connection. The longer that I used them the worse the problem became. Since both extension cords were defective, it seems likely that the entire manufacturing batch is bad.I recieved the appropriate information from Cummins Industrial Tools customer service department to return the extension cords, but they did not offer to pay any shipping. I may just dispose of them due to the high shipping cost. The two extension cords cost approximately $80 and the shipping both ways will cost me over $50.Poor quality and high shipping costs are a bad combination."
2,Very weak medicine which doesn't last...,"I am disappointed in this product. Member's Mark used to make a product called SINUS which I don't think they sell anymore. I bought the Allergy Multi-Symptom hoping it would be the same but it wasn't. It seemed to work fine the first day but the medicine is weak and you need to take more tablets throughout the day to get relief. On the second day I felt an odd pressure in my forehead and have not taken it since. I wonder what happened to the ""Maximum Strength SINUS Non-Drowsy"" tablets Member's Mark used to make?"
3,"Accuracy Issues ""Out of the Box""","Checking this thermometer in boiling water ""out of the box"", it read 207 degrees F. The needle on my thermometer is thicker than the one pictured, making it a bit more difficult to read the temperature (markings are at 5 degree intervals)."
4,Oceanic BioCube filter,"These are great little filters. They also fit the new coralife biocubes, it does vary on how long they last. I've had some last a month and a half and other's a weekend (though the tanke was being babysat so it might not be the fiters fault). My favorite thing about these is that if you hold them parallel to the ground they don't drip everywhere. The little bend at the end also makes it easy to hold onto with out getting your fingers wet!"
5,cradle bedding set,I ordered this cradle bedding set for our new grandson. Mom likes frogs and the cradle was made by my father for my nephew twenty five years ago. The quilt is so cute and the bumper pad is soft and cuddly. The sheet has little frogs jumping on it. So darling. It arrived the same day he came home from the hospital.
5,EXCELLENT CHRISTIAN ROCK,"Joel does what few modern Christian rock stars do. He writes and performs the roots of rock and roll. Too many modern rock stars have watered down their music to invoke a ""pop"" like quality to it. They have sold out. Joel's music combines the qualities of The Rolling Stones and The Steve Miller Band to deliver to you a sound that echoes of 70's rock while still delivering modern day lyrics. He shows you that you can still be Bold for the Savior while enjoying good ol' fashion rock and roll."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!,"This book has NO plot, NO idea, and NO point. Why don't you exercise your mind and read something useful? Try Moby Dick, or Little Women! Really, you outta be ashamed."
5,Great Purchase,My purchase came quickly without any hassle. The 9X13 looked spotless with no chips or cracks. Am very pleased that I bought my pan through Amazon.
4,Happy!,"I only really have one complaint and that it's made in China where the original dishes are made in USA...however...They match, are easily cleanable, usable, functional, and everyother way superb. I look forward to building my matching collection *they better not discontinue anything anytime soon!!* Happy Cooking!! and thank you Lisa Lebetkin ""liba"" for the suggestion of hunter green tupperwear!!"
3,I Kept Looking For Hawkeye and Hotlips...,"The serious part of this film is a subject that I'd like to know more about. A hospice for Vietnam War Soldiers and it being kept secret. Why be ashamed of something so admirable, so good, so right.The M*A*S*H-like atmosphere was fun, but why cover over the ""Mission of Mercy?"" Before the ""classified underground project"" was exposed and developed, I was almost ready to switch DVD's but I was hooked once the ""secret"" was in my face.I don't usually associate the price of a film with the actual product because a low price can indicate things other than the quality of a finished product film. Things like: an older, dated film or a subject matter that has fallen out of grace, overstocked item.I bought this film for one (1) cent and it was worth every penny."
4,How true this can be,"After doing a few months working in Thule, Greenland and seeing this movie made everything seem so real. With a little twist in the plot but made working at Thule Air Base seem so awesome. It has some real out of this world places where something like that could happen. And know one would know until something would be sent out and everyone would know something is going on. It's a small group of people that enjoy working North of the Artic Circle and know what is going on with almost everyone up there.Which is perfect for this movie. If you know anyone stationed at Thule. This is a good plot for normal life up there. I really liked it for that.It had some serious plot in it but a lot of partying and everyone knowing your business. How real it is."
1,You've got to be kidding. This is a movie?,"The words that come to mind: Cheaply-made, terribly acted, doofus direction, stupid. I'm not sure if they were trying to copy a STRIPES-type movie genre, but = BIG FAIL. Sucked. What made Natascha McElhone want to star in a stinker like this? Jason Biggs pigeon-holed himself into another dumb*** comedy. This, an American Pie in Greenland ? Nah. This movie is selling for 0.01 on Amazon (115 copies); that about sez it all."
3,Decent CD,"this was the first Black 47 cd I purchased. Expected a bit more from the album art and quality of the cd. It's not bad, just not spectacular."
5,Great highlights DVD,"My daughter was very into the Olympic Gymnastics competition this summary, so we bought her the DVD for Christmas. We aren't much of TV watchers at our house, especially her (she's 2 1/2), but she loves this DVD. It cuts out all of the deadtime in the actual competitions and gives you the highlights. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to relive the Games."
1,Save your money.,"NBC should vow out of the Olympics. Once again, instead of producing something wonderful, they choose instead to rush out a product to unwary fans, so they can make a few bucks! I missed most of the gymnastic competition and was really looking forward to watching the US women show their skills and win gold. You get a little of that (more like previews). Like another reviewer said, ""I wish I could return the video."""
2,Disappointing!,I am so disappointed with this DVD. The DVD is divided into two parts- the women's and the men's gymnastics. I only watched the women's portion. This DVD shows less footage than the live footage on NBC did! Some routines aren't shown in their entirety and some just aren't shown at all. Most of the focus is on the USA team but there are a few routines from the Russian girls featured. The bonus features are a few routines done by other gymnasts from other countries. I almost wish I could return this!
2,Ugh,"Talk about disappointing. This DVD is so not worth the money. We love the Olympics and watch them avidly, especially the gymnastics portion. I bought this DVD thinking ""great, we can watch it over again."" Um, it's only about 30 minutes or so of the entire women's gymnastics competition. That includes qualifying, team and individual! I can't believe what a rip-off this was. Not only did they show little snippets of team USA but there were hardly ANY clips of the other countries. Russia was a major contender for pete's sake and they're barely shown. Don't waste your money."
2,major disappointment,"I ordered this for my 3 year old daughter who watches the women's gymnastics olympic team final on NBC.com everyday. I am worried they will take it down at some point, so I ordered the dvd. The DVD is horrible - doesn't even have entire routines. It angered my 3 year old as routines were cut and appeared out of sequence. It also says it includes complete event finals which it does not. We will continue to watch the replay on nbc.com and I hope they never take it down. Total waste of money!"
4,Love It!,My six year old daughter LOVES her because of the giggling noises and shivering she does. She likes snuggling and sleeping with her new friend Shiver!
2,umm...okay?,"My daughter received this bear as a Christmas gift. I just plain dont get it I think. It shivers when you squeeze its foot...kiddo liked that. Then its cheeks lit up pink, which kind of freaked her out. Then it sings some unitelligable song (think teletubbies meets barbie) which bothered me..I wish they had at least made it to sing something repeatable. I just dont see the point.On another note, its made very well, should hold up for quite some time! My older daughter also loves that the bear wears a tiara. :)"
5,bear of ball of hairs.,"me parecio a exelente bear of peluche by which it has several movements, is glad greetings."
4,Love the PAAS Cartoon!,"I have watched Peter and the Magic egg since I was just a child. I always loved to watch it during eater time and it brings back so many memories! A classic cartoon featuring the original PAAS egg dye characters! A timeless classic, very enjoyable!"
3,Bad book,This book was interesting and cool. But it was stupid and unethical it made no sense what-so-ever. I believe in reading palms and other mysterious things but not this!
4,Joanna MacGregor unfortunately thrown out with the bathwater,"A definite improvement in the reissue of this landmark multi-artist WTC with it's variety of tasteful and resplendent venues, now sans repetitive scrolling banner credits.I agree we are probably ok without the spoken intros also, EXCEPT Joanna MacGregor's! The sparkling wit, insight and articulation she added verbally alongside her amazing playing in the original edition was indispensable. That issue is worth owning for her included commentary alone in my opinion. If only she had been given the entire project and introduced each and every part, you could have all the banners you liked with no complaint from me."
5,Great DVD - better than Season 1,Loved the DVD - my husband and I think season 2 is better than season 1 - much funnier! Very entertaining to watch and a great way to end the day.
5,Legend...wait for it Dary!,I love How I Met Your Mother. It is one of my favorite shows and it great to have the complete season two! I missed a few episodes last season and it's great to be able to catch up on the ones i missed plus the bonuis features are great too! If you like How I Met Your Mother or know someone who does this is great!
5,Funny,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and she loved it. A great TV show with lots of laughs.
5,How I met FUNNY,Fantastic show....laugh a minute with this cast. They portray a very real life view of how the late 20's and early 30's of one's life really can be. So many of these skits are very close to home. Glad CBS kept this show on. Thank you Amazon fro bringing this hit home!
5,Love it!,This for the quick delivery! I was able to get it in plenty of time to wrap that I gave it to him early so we opened it and watched it! It's a great show; everyone should see it!
4,4 thumbs up,"4 thumbs up- not quite as enjoyable as the first season, tho I have to admit the episode where Barney goes on The Price Is Right (aka TPIR) has got to be my fave episode ever!A good watch, very enjoyable, still very funny. Looking forward to season 3."
2,damaged,"I only recently discovered the damaged product becuase this season 2 collection comes with 3 discs. When I went to put in the 3rd disc, I found it was terribly scratched on the back. None of my DVD players can read the disc"
3,Gift to others,"i didn't buy this movie, myself, i gave it as a gift, so i really don't know what to say...""They liked it.""?"
3,Essential Elliman,"Yvonne Elliman's claim to fame may be her being in the origibnal cast recording of Jesus Christ Superstar. Her discography was never large and is under-represented on CD. This is an essential recording ! If you are able to grab others, do so !"
4,"impressive, leisurely film","A not too sentimental look at the lives of prostitutes, both domestic and illegally emigrated, in Spain, this film shows the influence of both Almodovar and the NeoRealists, while differing from and building on both...nothing here is as near-fantasticated as Almodovar's preferred mode, for example. One sort of pun I liked, which might get past non-Hispanophone viewers, is that the protagonist's ""street"" name is Caye, which is a homophone, or near enough, for ""calle"" or ""street"" in most Spanish-language accents. Sobering more than depressing, with a talented and striking cast, and a well-wrought character study as well as social critique."
5,excellent!!,"Well i went to see this movie in a local theater in Puerto Rico since one of the actresses is from P.R.,the movie is very deep and makes you think how lucky you are as a female,sometimes little details is what really count to make somebody's day.Princesas is a good title 'cause that's the way a woman feel when they are treated with dignity and respect.Great,great movie,every penny worth it.!! go see it or buy it,can't wait to be on sale on the U.S. region!!"
4,A Disturbing Look Into The Life Of Whoredom...,"This movie was really shocking to me. Basically it is the tale of two working girls in Spain. You live the world of being a hooker through the eyes of the Spanish girl who befriends another girl from the Dominican Republic who is living in Spain illegally to support her son back in the DR. I won't reveal the story but it is in many ways a very realistic, but tragic look into the lives of women who support themselves through sexual acts with men."
5,My Stuffies loved it!,"When my Dad gave me this book, I started using it at once with my own stuffies and stufflings. It helped my to nurture hurt stuffies and reassure well stuffies."
4,Bava's Nordic Western,"This is a very strong Mario Bava film that under the Nordic costumes and settings it comes across more as a western, with a terrific performance by Cameron Mitchell (who collaborated with Bava for Erik The Conqueror and Blood And Black Lace). Mitchell plays a beggar who saves a woman and her son from being assaulted by a couple of men with his prowess with knives (hence the title). The movie's familial themes, along with the avenger's conflicts between two divided camps makes this one of Bava's most engrossing and endearing films. This DVD comes with a four page booklet with liner notes by Tim Lucas, a Mario Bava biography and filmography, theatrical trailer, photo and poster gallery, and trailers from other Mario Bava's films.A worthwhile experience. Check it out!"
2,Cheaply Made,"The charm looks nice, but it is hollow and very light weight. The skin is extremely thin silver. I suspect that the flimsy charm will dent easily, making it very unattractive.In general, the item looks and feels cheaply made. Do not expect it to be any more than a novelty piece."
2,"Features good, convenience of earpiece not as good as others","I used to have the Logitech Mobile Pro bluetooth headset, which I loved, but I dropped it one too many times. When I sent it in to be replaced, they told me they no longer made that one and sent me a Mobile Traveller instead. The features are good but I hate the earpiece. It is much more difficult to get on then the Mobile Pro and it is much harder to hang it on my shirt when I'm not using it."
3,Keep the Sun out!,"This hat was nice for my Mexician vacation, it kept the sun out of my eyes. I only wish that it was a little more comfortable....it was a little stiff."
5,incredible,"Incredible Game. I played with this game long time ago, but I lost this game. And now, I played again. That's good"
4,Their best outing yet.,"I think that ALOL finally found their groove with this album. I think they discovered the style that suits them best and have developed a unique-sounding, southern metal tinged, and sonically amazing set. Of course I became hooked when I heard ""Vulture"", which is one of the best songs, but for me, the whole cd was very solid with lots of catchy, ear-shredding riffs and interesting, unusual song structures. In this genre, it becomes difficult for me to tell some bands from others. Unless they have a very unique vocalist or a trademark sound of some sort, it all blends together for me. And that is not to say that I don't enjoy it, but just that some bands don't stand out from others on the same talent level. ALOL definitely stood out to me, and I hope they release a new one soon! 4.5 stars."
3,Hunter,George Dionne made a nice review of this album but I disagree with mostly everything he had to write. I can understand everything the singer says and do not need the lyrics to understand it. The album is good but there is so many metal bands that its hard to pick one band from anther.
3,redundant... but intriguing...,"ok, so i bought this cd after hearing ""vulture"" (which is still my fav song...) I was disappointed from the get-go... but then it grew on me a little bit... I mean, alot of it... ok, ALL of it is repetitive... but it still sounds pretty good. I was alot most impressed with ""vulture"", ""grotesque"", & ""A Rush & Siege"" I guess... vulture is just kinda catchy i suppose... ""A Rush & Siege"" has great guitars, I love how the playing and the screaming all go together good... to me, this would be the only song that you could say ""sounds like Lamb of God"" as some of the other reviewers have mentioned... because overall, these guys just sound like themselves, not that that is a great thing... but yeah, overall im giving it a 3 because... well, because i wasnt really impressed, if you want some good Ferret, go buy Zao or ETID... they wont let you down like this..."
2,Very disappointing,"I don't get ALOL. On the Fourth Plague: Flies they had a very distinctive and abrasive sound. Then came a Great Artist, and I thought I was listening to a bad Meshuggah cover band's cd. Hunter is certainly better, but not by much. This band simply does not offer enough to sink your teeth into. They've toned down the blatant Meshuggah worship a little bit and have thrown a few Southern metal influences, but there's nothing really dynamic here. Metal like this is certainly more tolerable than nu metal but it's still become very generic and unexciting."
2,UGH,"this has got to be one of the most BORING Cds i've ever bought... all the songs sound the same!!!! There is nothing really exciting about it and gets VERY repetitive. Their best songs is ""Vulture,"" which isn't even all that good. They repeat the chorus's too much and all the verses sound the same. Absolutely no creativity. I don't understand why everyone thinks this CD is so great...it isn't and i would not recommend buying it"
4,Doesn't work in my Computer's CD player :(,"Looks like the CD's TOC is screwed up. Track 13 is listed as being over an hour long, and the 3 videos are not listed.So I can't rip it properly, so it's useless to me. Am chasing up to see if this is a known issue.As to the tunes though... Addictive. I particularly like The New Song and Computer Camp Love."
4,Keeps grandson attention,I got this video because of the great review and also cause my grandson (2 1/2) like to watch Tractor Tom from my video monitorwhen Im wrkng.Played the movie and it worked like a charm. It got his attention.I was disappointed when I found out his aunt got him the same oneand he has a copy at home.
3,It's OK,"I bought this DVD and the Real Wheels Tractor Adventors for my 20 month old son. He prefers the Tractor Adventors. I would recommend that one first. He will sit through the entire Tractor Adventures, but only about 5 minutes of this. Plus the music in this video is not my thing."
4,Pretty good for $5,"This video is a little bit dated (made around 1994), but luckily construction equipment doesn't change all that much. The only real complaint that I have is the ""Dig, Dig, Diggie"" song, which I believe is clinically proven to drive adults crazy. My son loved it though."
2,May be boring to kids already familiar with construction equipment,"This is a VERY slow paced video. I'm assuming the operators were told to go slow so the action is clear, but these guys would get fired for operating at this pace. My 5 year old even knew that, and asked me ""what was wrong with the driver"" at one point. Also, not a critical detail to a toddler, but there's some incorrect terminology used in several parts. Maybe it's just me, but it seemed like the production was shoddy. A lot of repetitive footage. Not a total waste of money, but FAR BETTER videos on youtube for free!"
4,Diggers and Dozers,My 3 year old grandson loves this video. Great footage of the trucks and equipment - what more could a 3 year old want?
3,Toddler Truck DVD,"Overall, not a BAD DVD for toddlers but alot of SLOW action that loses the interest of young children. Quality of the movie filming is mediocre. Truthfully, not a lot out there to choose from, so this qualifies as the lesser evil."
5,"lots of trucks,little price",This dvd is chok full of construction vehicles and for 6.99 I can't image anything more worth the money for my three year old. He loves it(his sisters too).
4,great gift idea,This was bought for my 2 year old son who si big into construction. A grreat video to watch again and again!
4,Truck video review,My kid loved all this had to offer and the bonus clips he especially loved where he also got to see more than construction vehicles. It has so much footage of various things and he loved some of the sing a longs.
3,Doesn't hold my son's attention,"This is a good ""tractor movie"" (what my son calls it), but is does not hold his attention. (He is 2.) It would be better for a child a couple of years older who is more interested in learning facts about the machines. Currently, he likes ""I Love Big Machines"". This is geared more to his age. He will actually sit and watch all of this one."
3,4 year old Fun,First machine DVD we own and 4 yr old boy likes it. 90 minutes is a long DVD but you can pick which section you prefer in the menu. Nothing annoying or scary about it. We had problems with it playing like other posts have said. It won't play on our DVD player but works on a portable unit. I would give it 4 stars but because of that issue I think 3 stars.
2,terrible video quality,Video quality is terrible gives me a headache to watch it. Seems to be slightly out of focus.causes eye strain.
2,Not a hit,This wasn't a hit with my grandson although I liked it. It is well scripted but not entertaining enough for a 3 year old
2,Not up to the legacy,"The Mamas and the Papas were one of the major bridges between folk and pop-rock in the early sixties. Their music was without peer, between the strength of John Phillips' compositions and the execution of them by the group as a whole--most memorably Michelle Phillips and Cass Elliot--they made a profound impression that belies their short existence as a group. As such I have to agree with the previous reviewer, there's simply not enough MUSIC to justify the price of this disc.What's needed is for some enterprising executive at some huge multinational oligopoly to realize that what's really needed is to release a dvd of live and studio performances, preferably as a companion to Cass Elliot's stellar ""Don't Call Me Mama Anymore"" show that was broadcast on network television in the early 70s (& recently re-released on CD). THAT would rate 5 stars!"
3,Great in small doses,"This is a fun Bhangra mix, but for those new to Bhangra, or those very familiar with it, I would opt for a straight Panjabi MC CD-I find I play those more often than Bar Bhangra. It's as if the producers were trying to get the quintessential Bhangra sound, and the result is that the songs begin to sound boringly similar midway through the album.At the same time, as part of a larger mix (think iPod), this CD is a great addition!"
4,Intro to Bhangra,"This is a great collection of Bhangra for anyone just getting started. It offers many well-known Bhangra artists and a taste of the ""dinka dinka dinka"" sound that is Bhangra's trademark. The standout tracks are from MIDIval PunditZ, Swami, Achanak, and Panjabi MC.If you're looking for good Bhangra, check out Desi Nation. Together, both albums can easily support an impromptu dance party, heavy on the dhols."
4,A great look into & a good overview of the inside of the FBI,"I know and work with Buck Revells' brother Dennis and Dennis told me that it was a good read. I knew that if Buck had his brothers integrity and analytical thinking process, that this indeed would be a good read. I was not disappointed. This book gives an excellent insight into the FBI, which given the number of times Buck & Sharon Revell moved stands for Forever Being Inconvenienced. Good facts about the cases involved but not too much given away. It is a good ""guys read"", fast paced with detail it never gets boring. I enjoyed this and can whole-heartedly recommend it to all."
4,"A fascinating look inside the ""real"" FBI","An in-depth introspective into the career of one of America's true unsung heroes. This book gives a different prospective into the inner workings of the FBI. Revell is honest and forthright in both his praise and admonishment of the FBI. He tells us when and how they did it right and what they did wrong. How the FBI has made the lives of Americans safer, while trying to balance the rights of citizens and the responsibilities of a vigilant law enforcement agency. He is also very forthright in his criticism of the Bureaus shortcomings. Revell probably has done more to advance American law enforcement then any other person in the last 20 years. Only the controversial J Edgar Hoover has done more to shape the FBI into the premiere law enforcement organization in the world."
4,Exciting Information With Revealing Insight,"It is an informative novel which gives exciting insight into one of the most famous law enforcement agencies of America. Not only learning about the cases that Oliver Revell worked on, but knowing how others in the FBI, including J. Edgar Hoover, thought and said is purely fascinating. This is a must read to anyone interested in the FBI, law enforcement, or federal government agencies."
1,"Are you happy that you saved your son from Pan Am 103, Ollie","Oliver Revell wrote his memoires....or did he forget some of them ? Some things are clearly missing in his book.Revell wrote to the readers of amazon.com personally ""I will be pleased to respond to comments and questions regarding my book and career."" Well, let us see how he responds to this:""Are you happy that you saved your son from Pan Am 103, Ollie? Do you sometimes think about who was the unlucky guy or girl who took your son's seat and flew right into death that day the 21st of December 1988 ? Or do you still not bother today as you din't bother then ?""Other crap that upset me on reading the reviews of his book was this phrase: ""Women who read this book will find a true heroine in Revell's wife.""Perhaps it should have read: ""Young airline passengers who read this book will find a true hero in Revell's son.""!!!"
1,"Tedious, 'kiss and tell', starts fast and slows to a crawl.","Interesting for the first few chapters but after that I sense that the author reaches to take credit for some pretty incredible achievements. Mostly telling who did what to whom when and if you're not an insider, it won't matter."
5,Insightive,"A wonderful book, with insights for parents of deaf children. This book proves our deaf children do not think any differently to hearing children and having a disability does not go hand-in-hand with being disabled. A wonderful read for parents of deaf children."
1,CHINESE TORTURE CHAMBER STORY iII,Terrible!! The story line can not be followed because it jumps around to much. Do not waste your money. Terrible.
3,Chinese Torture Chamger Story II,All I can say is...I'm glad the justice system isn't like that in ancient China. Phew!! There's some rough stuff in this flick. Yikes!! My rating for this one is three stars!
4,Great Stuff!,"I purchased this product about two months ago. Started working out again 12 months ago and was looking for something to help step it up a bit, I'm not a young guy anymore (46) so I needed some help. The Animal Stak really came through, I do a full body workout 3x a week and on the second week I could feel and see the difference, all my sets went up in weight, nothing crazy but a good 5-15 lbs. The biggest change was my triceps so I am really pleased with that. I had used Animal Pak years ago and liked that also, so I use that on workout days too along with some protein powder. Just trying to keep it simple, not like some of my younger colleagues who like to buy everything they hear about. Just my opinion on the product. I will be ordering more and maybe even try the Animal Test in a couple of months."
2,"Hype, simple and cheap tribulus will do","There's a lot of hype around animal/universal products. I used two cans of stak will minimal result. I was lucky to find out after 3 years of trial and errors that there's a lot of hype in the supplement industry. Fake reviews, models etc...you name it. Protein, creatine MONOHYDRATE(yes you get water retention and blah blah...but it's the most studied, oldest and proven form of creatine that delivers results), a nice multivitamin and a CONSISTENT workout routine is the secret. Look back at all the supplements you've taken and ask yourself for how long and are you where you thought you'll be? Get in the gym a workout consistently changing your routine often and see for yourself. Consistency my friend...consistency, unless you want to go the steroid way."
1,I remember when I was a high-school lifter...,"M-stak is a big statement on the supplement industry today... that statement being that you can get stupid high school guys to buy just about anything, myself included. I bought it because it was marketed as a ""new way to get anabolic results without hormones"".Not only our flavones not proven to work, but there are actually several occasions where they've been proven to NOT work including one test where 100% of test subjects trying animal m-stak lost 30+ dollars."
1,Weak product,"As far as a mass and size enhancer it does nothing,but if you have the stomach to digest 5 packs (35 pills)it may give you a slight boost in energy."
3,Might work,I used this and I will say it did improve my sleep and I seemed to get a few more reps towards the end but may have gotten those anyway with good diet and workouts. So if it works is a tad questionable so I am on the fence. By the time I finished with a course it had gone way up in price and wasnt on prime so I am not going to try it again. YMMV
3,upset stomach,"I've been putting up a lot of weight, have 7 days left but my stomach is getting upset every day!Will finish it nonetheless but should not buy again!"
4,Works well for pushing through sticking points,"Gave me slighly higher quality workouts and helped me push myself through two plateaus. One last year one this year. If you are looking for a boost check this out. If you are looking for a huge increase quickly, this product will not give you that."
3,Not Advanced at all,"I was looking for a book to study for my MOUS Excel Expert exam and I thought that maybe after reading Excel Step by Step I could find something more advanced in this book, but I was wrong. This book is to superficial for an Advanced user, if you read the Excel Step by Step you have it all. Most of the topics that are shown in this book are already in the Excel Step by Step, I couldnt find the ""advanced"" in this bookDiana Vazquez Instructor MOUS Certified"
4,Good as Far as it Goes,"Not ""advanced"", just ""more"". Does drive home the utility of the selected features in a business context. Does not include the Scenario Manager. Does not have anywhere near all the features: for that, see ""Running Microsoft EXCEL 97"". Very limited discussion of macros and VBA."
4,Good as far as it goes,"Not really ""advanced"", but just ""more"" features described. A glaring omission is the Scenario Manager. The strength of the book is a concrete small business context in which the examples are driven home. The drawback is lack of coverage, including many details of the features that are described. For more detail and more features, but few examples, ""Running Microsoft EXCEL 97"" is better. For many more examples, and some features not covered here, ""EXCEL for Scientists and Engineers"" is better (but no Scenario Manager or Pivot Table discussion)."
1,Not True,"This review may seem a little bit offensive and look like a personal attack but I'm sorry to say that's the best I can say about this book and its author.This book is as evil as the painting found in the hypothetical healing session that the author narrates.It's evil because it can deceive would be Sufi aspirants and mislead them concerning the essence of Sufism.To be honest I don't think this autobiographical exposition is true. I think it has all been made up, crafted with slyness (but not intelligently) to appeal to would-be Sufi aspirants and fans of mysticism.The only impression I got from reading this book, I couldn't finish by the way because of its sheer banality, is that Mr. Reshad is not very a very genuine man (that's saying it in the best of manner I can).Please if you're looking to know what Sufism is really about, read somewhere else. This is not Sufism!"
5,great country/no depression music from Australia,"I was strongly taken by Halfway's lyrics and guitar strumming. Patience Back is a combines a beautiful melody, enchanting lyrics and an upbeat theme to make it one of my favorite songs.Halfway is the premier alt country group in Australia. For those who enjoy Gram Parsons, the Byrds, Big Star or the Jayhawks, this will sound wonderful."
4,"Perrine's Literature : Structure, Sound, and Sense",Read this book for Freshman English in high school. nice alternative to a textbook. Wouldn't really want to read this outside of class.
4,Classic holder,"It is a great business card holder, the only issue I had was it was bigger then I needed."
3,Some music stands the test of time...,"Unfortunately, ""Diamonds in the Raw"" doesn't hold up to that measurement. Former lead vocalist Mary Davis had left the group, and the songwriting team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, so instrumental in the group's previous successes, was noticeably absent on this release. Though the dance cuts ""Men Don't Cry,"" ""Secret Wish,"" and the ballad ""Hold Out"" are comparable to the group's earlier works, the album, as a whole, is a lesser effort and can only be thought of as a ""period piece,"" indicative of the sounds of the decade that spawned it."
3,Diamonds,"Good effort but lacks the Davis signature, seems the band tried moving away from the 80's and into a new decade, For an SOS fan it will be one of their least favorites."
4,It's nice but beware,"i always read a lot of reviews before buying. the other reviews of this product are correct, except for the one person who thinks it is cheaply made. i disagree.take note, though, there are at least two basic types of rack shelves. this one has parallel slots. the other type that i know of has random looking holes - it kind of looks like stars in the sky. some gear, like the half rack piece i wanted to rack, is not compatible with the parallel slot-type of shelf. eventually I'll find a use for this one, but still need the other one."
4,Nice Rack,I bought this shelf because it was a lot cheaper than the Middle Atlantic unit. The metal thickness is just as good and the finish matches well. The ventilation hole pattern is not as pictured. The current model has a regular pattern of slots and can be seen on the Raxxess web site.
3,Rack does not go all the way back.,"The rack ony goes halfway back. I didnt see that in the description and was somewhat upset when it arrived, and I found out then.It's a great product if you only need a shelf that only goes about 6"" inches back and leaves the rest hanging. It has it's uses, I just didnt see that when reading the description."
4,A GOOD BOOK,"Although this is a non-fiction book, it was very helpful in understanding the disease. Another book that does even a better job of this is the ficitonal novel, Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher . ..Ms Fisher has lupus and wrote this book with her heart! A fantastic read/ edited by her lupus specialist. ..It is enertaining, and captures every emotion known to men and women. And excellent book, meant to be shared. For sure you will love it."
4,Very cute story.,"This is a very cute story/documentary about two otters that live with a family and one in particular, Tinker, who befriended the family's puppy. The footage of the animals playing together is wonderful. However, the story begins somewhere in the middle, and there is no background on the family or how they acquired these otters. The film is only 25 minutes long and the editing is a little rough. But, I have never seen a dog and an otter play together or otters playing in the snow. Despite the fragmented quality, I would definitely recommended it!"
3,EARLY BAVA EFFORT....,"I expected more from this film because so much had been written about it and when I saw the packaging I assumed it would be a wild little movie. This was not the case however. Due to obvious budget constraints ""I Vampiri"" is somewhat of a letdown. It's not bad, it's just disappointing. A wealthy countess stays beautiful thanks to ""scientific methods""---blood transfusions---from female victims. Atmosphere is plentiful but it's SO low budget that it's creaky and not creepy. It would have helped had Bava been more daring with the story and plot elements but for some reason he wasn't. What is here is timid with very little action. Much time is spent on the detective pursuing leads and a lot of talk when the running time is so short. It's worth noting as an early Bava horror film but that's about it. He would obviously fare better in the future."
4,Bava - eye of a cinematographer,"Mario Bava is an unsung (well okay, under-sung) innovator who reminds me of Robert Wise in many ways - a thoroughly competent, sometimes inspired director who tried and excelled in almost every genre and redefined about half of 'em as he went. Bava also had the eye of a cinematographer (he was one for quite a while) and invented in-camera FX which are some of the most striking in B&W film history... just when movies were turning color! Bava's later stuff is better known, like The Mask of Satan (aka Black Sunday)... but this is almost as good."
5,The Dream Team,This is a historic performance that has emerged succesfully from the acid test of time.No one can imagine such a team like those three giants playing those masterworks. This isthe absolute reference for the Tchaikovsky's Trio and a first option for Mendelssohn's. Aneverlasting essential recording.
2,3 Pilots for Theatrical Release,"""Tarzan and the Trappers"" was a film re-edited from three 1958 pilot television shows for NBC produced by Sol Lesser. The pilots never sold NBC on the profitability for such a series. They starred Tarzan, Gordon Scott. The re-edited episodes followed conventional jungle drama concerning the whereabouts of ""lost treasure."" It is just average."
4,The first new book I've recommended in a long time.,"I don't recommend books easily, and it isn't easy to find a new book that goes beyond material the Scott Cunningham covered quite adequately. This one does. Ivo discusses not only various methods of creating sacred space, but the preparation one should do before hand, physically, emotionally and spiritually. I recommend this book highly."
5,Country Legends DVD ~ Merle Haggard (and others),"The title is misleading - sure Merle is on the video - but some of the greatest of country music are also along with their most favorite and greatest hits. For the collector of country history, this DVD is a must to own. Conway does IT'S ONLY MAKE BELIEVE - and the shiver's run down your back ! George gives you THE GRAND TOUR & Patsy goes WALKIN AFTER MIDNIGHT ... A full hour of history legends & the best country music of all times."
3,Two books with the same ISBN,This wordsworth classic unfortunately has the same ISBN number as the single Little Women book.Please be careful when ordering to verify which version you will be receiving.The fact that Wordsworth didn't obtain a separate ISBN for this double book is disturbing and unethical.
2,Still Disappointing,"I just came across this volume on my bookshelf when searching for an answer to an Illustrator question and findthat the book is still as disappointing as it was when I purchased it. This is definitely for the novice. I'm sure Mr. Golding is quite well versed in the software so the book must be intended for beginners although it says for intermediate/advanced users. This book is extremely frustrating. There are paragraphs that say (I paraphrase here), ""You can even do this"", and then not tell you how. Mordy, I implore you, if you are going to tell us all the nifty things that make Illustrator wonderful then add some pages to this relatively small volume and show us how."
4,handy book for Illustrator artist,"If you want to increase your current Illustrator knowledge this book is a good choice, take you inside to the knowledge of the program.Good design and great proposed learning structure.Isn't a book for illustrators as it, is just more a book for people interested in knowing more the tool."
4,Country Kitchens from the 1990s---mostly....,"I bought this book in the early 1990's, therefore, I'm almost sure that the copyright on this book (ie: 2007) is for the ""reprint"" of this original 1990's book.Still, in the 1990's this book was ahead of it's time, so if you are interested in a nice picture book of beautiful country kitchens, this is a nice book for your library. In my opinion, this is not really a ""how to"" kitchen remodeling book, but rather, a book with wonderfully photographed ideas for your country-style kitchen. The ideas are classic and hold up well , even in 2007."
5,FABULOUS!,"Fabulous is the word! I think I look at this book at least 10 times, and everytime brought me something I didn't see the previous times, because my eyes weren't wide enough to see all the details! If you loved, I mean really love country, you will love this book. It will become a good reference for good ideas for your kitchen.I think it is one of my favorite book in my whole collection of books! Give me some more like this one and I will surely buy them!MargotQuebec city, Canada"
4,foreward to the past,"Magnific item. When you love that kind of music it is the item to have. Brings you back in a kind of golden days who can only return via this way.Ideal gift for them who lived the 40's and 50's. Souvenir souvenir Thats why I bought a number of these cd end dvdMax Raabe and Palast Orchester: Dance & Film Music of 1920s.Wochenend und SonnenscheinSuperhits, Vol. 2Max Raabe and Palast Orchester: Dance & Film Music of 1920sKomm Lass Uns Einen Kleinen Rumba Tanzenetc..."
5,The most hilarious text,Once again Max Raabe has succeeded to bring across joy of life and humor. I love his music. And the Palastorchester is impeccable
1,Product didn't work properly.,"This color printer cartridge was cheaper then the dell price, that's why I bought it. Turns out this was a total piece of junk and didn't even work properly with my Dell A960 printer. It only printed in shades of green and black and thus was garbage. Do not buy this item if you want a working color cartridge."
1,Hated it!,"This product will not work in my Dell printer. It is not a genuine Dell product as stated. I KNOW remanufactured or refilled cartridges will NOT work on Dell products, therefor i made sure it stated Dell Product. Its NOT! So, now I have papers due, resumes to print, and a printer that wont print!!!"
3,Black ink is not Dell Series 2 brand.,"The black ink is advertised on the Amazon web site as being Dell Series 2 Ink. It is a replacement cartridge that fits my Dell printer. While I've yet to use the cartridge, I have found replacement cartridges that are not Dell often do not have the same print quality.I do not have a problem with the replacement being sold as long as it is portrayed honestly on the web site. When I complained to the Company that shipped the ink they immediately issued me a refund."
3,potential,"Seems a little trite and just didn't get to me musically the way some other ""Texas"" musicians have been able to do. But give the man an ""A"" for effort. All in all an okay CD - needs a good producer and maybe an experienced collaberator on a few songs."
1,Not the best selection I've made,"In my opinion, ""Echo"" by Francesca Lia Block isn't even worth a review. A short novel that I found completely lacking any meaning you care to relate to, I thought ""Echo"" was a complete waste of time. I would definitely not read it again, but I guess I'm the only one that feels that way. So go ahead, maybe you'll see what everyone else did in it."
2,Confusing.,"This book was alright. The writing was (as frequently described) intoxicating. However, like many of FLB's books, it was extremely hard to follow. It switches between characters every chapter, and her word choice doesn't always make sense to the reader; I seriously read many parts of the book over and over trying to decipher her cryptic descriptions to no avail. It's very confusing, which only gets annoying as you continue reading.I used to be a die-hard FLB fan when I was in middle school, but now I'm not so impressed. I think this book would appeal more to angsty teenagers (13-17 years) who feel like misunderstood outcasts and write poetry inspired by their depression.(Although I still enjoy occasionally reading ""Missing Angel Juan"" and ""Witch Baby."" And ""Wasteland"" is my all-time favorite book of FLB.)"
3,An interesting but unfortunate read,"It's true, this book had an interesting storyline, and the language use was captivating and beautiful, that I'll admit. Unfotunately, I now and always will think of this book as ""what happens when a poet tries to make the transition to fiction and misses the mark"". I loved this book for its exquisite and rarely found use of descriptiveness, but the susbstance of the story was sadly thin. If you want to be dazzled by words but don't care for a real story, then look no further! But if you want something award worthy, keep searching."
2,"Wimsical, yet confusing and pointless","I have not read any other of Francesca Lia Block's books. And, after reading Echo I am afraid of actually buying another. I hate to sound mean, but I found the perspective changes sudden and completely confusing. The reason I am apprehensive about buying another one of Block's books is because Echo lacked plot and reason. It was simply a tale of life and I kept waiting for something to actually happen. But, no, it was simply a tale of her life. And maybe if it held my imagination more, I would have adored it with its interesting characters and such.So, if you really need a book that keeps your mind captive I do not suggest this novel. I was left waiting for it to end."
1,Very Disappointing,"I saw Echo in the book store, picked it up and looked at the back to see what it was about. All it said was ""Exquisitly wrought coming-of-age story. This of course is not a summary, or any hint as to what this story is about. So I take a chance and buy it. I get home and start to read it. I was very confused. There isn't any strange words used, as in Shakespeare for example. But the words are out of order. The story itself does not follow any direction. You always seem to be reading from another character's point of veiw. This may not seem bad, but only until you are almost done with the chapter, do you even know who you are reading about. Maybe this story was over my head, although I don't believe it is, since I have read much deeper books than this. All in all I give it one star. It wasn't terrible, but it could have been a lot better."
1,An Echo of Disappointment,"I found Echo to be a very disappointing book, and a waste of money. The book jumps around from person to person which is sometimes good, but in this case I'd say it's bad. The connection between the people in this book isn't too strong and I don't think that one person has much to do with the other. Basically, I can't even tell you what this book is about. I honestly have no idea. It jumps around so much that I have no idea what it's trying to say or what the message behind it is. I wouldn't really recommend it but if you like books that jump around, go ahead."
5,Enchanting,"A captivating storyline, this books seems almost bewitching, each line read seemingly converting plain, simple words into pure magick. Although some of the contained texts are clearly not intended for audiences beneath the age of 8, this author has still managed to capture the spirit of youth, fantasy, and innocence and project it through dynamic characters gracefully within this book."
3,predictable but still good,"'echo' has all the trapping of now what seems to be francesca lia block's signature style - teenage girl with some sort of insecurity who is trying to find her way in life. you have to hand it to francesca, she writes passionately about following your dreams, surviving adversity, and believing in yourself. she's sensualist with an eye for detail with food, flowers, locations, people. but too much of it seems like a rehash of her other books, character and theme-wise. as much of a cult following that she's got, maybe it's time for her to write a novel about something other than teenage girls in l.a., as they're all beginning to sound the same, though the names are different."
2,Could Have Done Better,"I love Block's writing, but was slightly disappointed with Echo. It is a good story yet seems to jump around and is more like a spider-web that cannot hold its own weight. The story is a little bit of a merry-go-round, yet for anyone that likes Block's writing will like this book. But they will probably use it for a paper-weight afterward. Meaning, this is a book not to be recommanded."
3,Not her best,"This is not nearly as good as ""The Hanged Man"" in my opinion, but it is still pretty well written. If you're thinking about reading it, I would recommend it, just keep in mind that it is not one of her greatest."
1,Echo,One word describes this book. RUBBISH. Parents you would be wise to read this book before you let your child. Or you will be as Echo's mother oblivious to her life. I can't believe this is a so called teen novel. I wouldn't let my 80 year old mother read it and she has been through life. Pick your poison so to speak. I threw this book across the room when I was finished and the last time I did that was with a John Grisham novel. It didn't deserve one star. I guess this has been more than one word. OUT
5,Very interesting.,"I have only read this and ""I was a teenage fairy,"" by FLB. I think this book was better! I found a couple of parts confusing but otherwise the mixture of the fairy-tale, vampires and realism (as in her other books) is amazing."
4,Echoing in my mind for days to come,"I was at the book store walking around trying to find a book in the teen section. This book caught my eye because of the cover and I imediatly picked it up to buy it. Now when I started it I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, but I soon got myself intertwined in the pages, so deep that even the yelling of my teachers couldn't break my thought. Though at times confusing, by the middle it's easy to catch on the changes of narration and thought. I enjoyed this book to the very end and plan to re-read it, for my own enjoyment, very very soon. Echo is a girl who is a bit of everyone, from teenager to adult. It's nice to be able to get a realistic flow of her life through the magical imagination and truth she brings. A def. must read."
4,Magical,"I think this story unfolds uncorrectly, same with the end. I definetly didnt like the change of characters ever-so often..I would like it based ONLY on Echo. Other than that, I loved this book, just like other FLB books! Read DANGEROUS ANGELS!!"
5,Simply Brilliant...,"As usual, Francesca Lia Block out-does herself in this sumptously glittery beautifully done work of metrulicious. Not only teens will apply to Echo's character, but also anyone else who feel that they're confined to only one talent, and anyone else who feels lonely in this gritty world. EVERYBODY SHOULD READ THIS!!"
4,Excellent,"This is an excellent microscope. I bought it for my seven year old daughter, but it is useful for anyone of any age. Almost everything on this microscope works well and is very well built. The only problem I have is the focus drifts at times. This why I gave the microscope a four star rating instead of a five.The range of the lenses is very good. The dim-able light is nice to have. This is just a very good microscope. I can see is lasting for a very long time."
5,amazing,Exactly what my 10 yr old wanted. Her teacher was even impressed. I bought pre-prepared slides and that has been a great addition. She loves to play the guessing game with us and see which something is the grossest
1,Didn't work,"Plugged it in, no light. Kinda cheap looking.Only pro it arrived on time, to bad I couldn't use it."
4,Great,"This is an excellent microscope. I bought it for my seven year old daughter, but it is useful for anyone of any age. Almost everything on this microscope works well and is very well built. The only problem i have is the focusing drifts at times. This why I gave the microscope a four star rating instead of a five."
4,"shammy davis junior , man","with three songs pulled from the incredible ""now"" l.p. (that's three more than the box set has .) this cd is a must own for hipsters . sammys ""shaft"" cover makes me smile just thinking about it . i'm in heaven . please reissue the whole ""now"" album , please , please ."
5,Complex and Compelling,"Rankin manages to intertwine multiple stories and numerous great characters without ever losing his reader. Then, he neatly ties it all up in the end, without ever having a contrived feel."
4,Almost too many subplots,"This was my first Inspector Rebus book and I enjoyed it. My problem is there are far too many subplots, prostitutes from Russia, Japanese Yakaze, Mr. Pink Eyes, British Intelligence, Strawman, the Mossad, the Rat Line and the hit and run attack on his daughter. It was written for careful reading, do not try to speed read as I usually do. Although complicated I enjoyed the story and took the time to read it carefully. This is not a book to read while sitting by the pool and relaxing."
4,Great novel - great series.,I have read all of the Rebus books and the 'Hanging Garden' was the last I read. It was a fun read.
4,Good solid read!!!,"This book is just great, a good solid story, great characterisation, and will lots of atmosphere. Rebus is one of the classic detective characters. Dark, moody...of course a maverick who gets the results. Great stuff.My favourite Ian Rankin book!! Bring back Rebus!!!"
3,Unoriginal.,"The lily of the valley, freesia, and jasmine in this fragrance are not well-behaved on me. If you have problems with white florals too, try before you buy.This is soapy but not in a good way - soapy like a typical laundry detergent in the USA. Unoriginal."
2,Shipping Costs!,The product is fine but isn't it infuriating when companies charge such an unnecessarily high amount for shipping? This item can be shipped anywhere in the U.S. for under a dollar. For seven dollars I should get a paratrooper drop onto my roof with the delivery a few minutes after I order!
5,Love these.,"For me, these are almost perfect.+ rigid cover makes it easy to write in whether at a desk or not.+ high quality paper is smooth, takes pencil and ink well.+ high quality paper is heavy enough that you can write on both sides without ""ghosting"" or distracting ""see through"" effect.+ the spiral binding is high-quality -- will not snag or make fully opening the notebook hard.+ gloss black cover stands out from the piles of paper on my desk.Possible downsides:- no pockets.- the thick covers make it pretty heavy for a 70-page notebook.- not actually 8.5"" x 11"".In sum, highly recommended."
3,Let me save you some money.,Sew it together wonky and don't correct your mistakes. That's pretty much the whole book in one sentence and I just saved you $30 to $60.You're welcome.
4,Eye opening,"This has quadrupled my enthusiasm for quilting.as the liberated approach is so much fun. My goal was toi make a tshirt quilt for a friend. I wanted it to be very special and didn't want it to look like the typical blocked tshirt quilt. I was extremely happy with the results. Once you get started, its hard to stop! I particularly like layout of the book as the authors have detailed how to make specific blocks . It's very easy to follow and awakens creative juices that I didn't know I had!"
5,Free spirit?,"Beeing a self-taught quilter and a ""one time is enough pattern-follower"" I simply loved this book! If you buy quilting books just for the patterns this is probably not the book for you, but if you like me read books for inspiration you will love this one. The photos are simply wonderful and the author's way of working is very easy to follow. This will be one of the few books I will read and enjoy more than once."
5,An essential liberation!,This book is an absolute inspiration. This way of working is so wonderfully freeing and draws forth creativity long buried beneath a plethora of rules. It connects one to quiltmaking's past and propels you forward into a broader future. I would not be without it.
1,It's Just A Bibliography?,"I looked up this entry in the U. of Miami library, but what I found was not a book, but a BIBLIOGRAPHY, a list of old articles and books on movie theaters, their construction and such, compiled by a librarian, Carole Cable, in Texas in 1982, and distributed by a company that provides bibliographic lists on various topics.I've been hoping to find a book on the subject, but what seems to exist is decades old. Other online sources have told me ""there is little written on the subject"".If anyone know of good info, please emial me. Thanks."
4,Helpful whether you do unit studies or not,"I've only done a few unit studies over the years ... they're a lot of work. But the ideas here are very helpful, whether you do unit studies or not, for integrating subjects to some degree. If you've toyed with the idea of using unit studies but aren't sure, this book will give you a clear idea of whether or not they're for you."
2,not supportive,"too streachy and don't do as stated, and the lube sample was just miserable it was like using a jar of jelly very sticky and not what i'd buy or claim as a lube."
1,Not what I wanted,"I wanted the book by this title but this is some kind of video series workbook,it seems. How do I get the book?"
5,Rage...Touches the heart!,"I have enjoyed this album so much for it's quality of music, performance and production. A great Musical Theater sound.The voices are so suited to the characters they portray and I felt the excitement of individual songs as well as the overall story.In ""Fire"" the terrific tenor(Abelard)made me feel as if I could go out and do great things! Stirring stuff.In ""Dear Husband Dear Wife"" the warmth and beauty of this soprano (Heloise)makes me feel the depth of her love and emotion.The Miserere touches the heart, as does the whole album, and would surely find the mercy it asks for??There is humour in the album as well.In all, a most stunning and unusual album...Meaning it is all BEAUTIFUL in capital letters.Marmie"
4,Solid Release,"The new cd by Throwdown isnt exactly musically groungbreaking. But if you like straight forward Hardcore music, then this is a great release. The production and the vocals are improved 10 fold over their last CD . Its almost hard to believe its the same guy who was singing on ""Haymaker"". I dont really hear the Pantera similarities. One of the best songs on the CD is ""Give My Life"". It has a sick breakdown at the end. I caught them on the Sounds Of The Underground tour in Orlando and they were definately standout performers. Catch them if you can. 5 stars for performance."
4,damn good,"well...this is not throwdown....this is pantera at its finest...this is early 90's style metal and its very very good. throwdown changed there style...and a few new members...there drummer ben made things better(double bass). this is still a very heardcoreish cd...but it has some metal elements in it....alot fans will be pissed, or shocked...i was shocked..not what i was expecting at all...a very good cd...but its not throwdown..they sould change there name."
4,VANDETTA!!!!! !!!,Most technical effort from the boys apart from the later stuff. Less metal and more hardcore than Venom. Sounds like Pantera doing hardcore rather than a pantera clone. All songs are awesome. These guys know how to bridge up a song.
2,Umm,"To the guy below: you found this in the ""hardcore/punk"" section because Throwdown is a hardcore band...No matter how many mediocre attempts they take at metal, they are always going to be a hardcore band first and foremost."
1,One of the worst bands in hardcore's history,"Throwdown and Hatebreed have got to be two of the worst bands hardcore music has ever seen. I listened to this entire album, and I have decided that these ""musicians"" only know how to play a few chords and they repeat them on every album. Get some originality. Check out Undoing Ruin by Darkest Hour."
5,A pleasant kick in the mouth.,"this is gym music. this is ass kicking music. this is getting your head caved in music. this is a vendetta. now kill fred durst! this about as true as it gets for hardcore. honor, pride, and strength. this album is true and solid."
4,What I asked for,"I ordered this book for senior quote ideas. The only ""issue"" I had was that there was a large crease in the cover of the book, as well as small written initials on the front. When I purchased the book, the condition did not say new, so I knew what I was getting! Great seller, and super-fast delivery."
1,Customer Service is Horrible,"I bought this swisher mower to mow 1.75 acres. The mower worked fine for my use but the wheel bearing on the rear tire failed after one use. I used the mower for a total of 1.5 hours. Called customer service and they said bearings are a wear item and not cover under warranty despite the fact that it was only used for 1.5 hours. Instead of saying I'm sorry you experienced problems with our product and that I must have gotten a defective bearing and they would send out some new parts, I had to send photos for them to look at (apparently my work is not good enough). After I sent photos it was like they didn't believe what they seen. I had to go round and round, send pictures, and more pictures, wait on hold for 10 minutes each of the four times I called. This company definitely does not stand by their product. To think bearing failure after 1.5 hours is normal wear is completely ridiculous."
4,It was Hard Cutting for the Swisher 60'' bush hog,"I put the swisher bush hog through the works today. The 14.5 hp peformed like a champ. Of course this is the first time i used it since i received it last month. I had to repair four wheeler first. It was rough cutting. Small stumps and limbs, going thru small ditches and old four wheeler tracks that kids had made on the property when the last owners had the property.It was so rough even though i was going a slow as i could in 1st gear.The Lock nut that attaches bush hog to four wheeler came off. So I went and got another and the shoot where the grass comes out, one of the nuts feel off of the bolts on that. Anyway I am well satisfied with the performance it game me today. I will get the property plowed up and cleaned up for next cutting and this should make it a lot better.Well there isn't much more I can say.Well satisfied,Tim Leger"
1,POS!,"This mower is junk! Deck, engine, side discharge, all junk! Save your $2,000. You have to clean the deck after every mowing or deck fills up and burns up blades. bumped a sandstone at slow speed and ripped rite side roller tire clear off of the deck. choke is at the top of the throttle control, go just barely too far, and flooded engine. have been at it for 6+ hours today (replaced belt, cleaned deck, changed blades, charged battery 3 times) and have got 15 mins mowing done. Prime example of poor engineering or no engineering. DO NOT BUY THIS MOWER!"
1,Save your money!,I used this mower for the first time and the belts wore out within the first 2 hours. Must be a symptom of a bigger problem since I was mowing with the deck all the way up in light grass.
5,The original feel-good music,"This music has always had a special place in my heart, and as an Americana gospel performer, I go back to this style much in playing for church and coffeehouse gigs. If you want to go mining for good solid tunes to play, go here or buy Harry Smith's Anthology of Folk Music. It is one of maybe 10 sources for evidence in a course I would call Americana 101. Unlike Louis Armstrong, who was making a big town name for jazz and blues at the time, this is the street music played in the rural South and Memphis.It is hard not to smile when you hear this wobbly stuff..."
3,could be better,i didnt really like this dvd at all i mean it had good videos but they wernt good quality at all i think if a company is goin to make a movie at least make it good quality
3,"Great content, terrible price.","A fantastic installment in the new Dr. Who series -- but this price is unforgivable. The UK version of the DVD set is selling for only 20 or so -- roughly $30 US at current exchange rates. Give us a break, BBC..."
5,Silence in the Library,"I wondered how New-Who was going to fare, and I have found that it is like every other show - slow times, good times, Huh? times. Silence is one of those absolutely Brilliant times. While there are many episodes I like, Silence is on the list of one of those I love. The writing is good, the premise is good, the acting is good - I can't think of any sore spot."
5,Excellent!,"This episode along with ""The Stolen Earth"" are probably two of my favorites. I love how they reunited everyone to fight the Daleks. Sad to see David Tennant go, however. He was great as The Doctor. And I'll miss Catherine Tate as Donna too. I have not watched seasons five and six yet, but this season is probably one of my favorites so far."
4,BBC America cut the heart out of this!,"I recently watched the re-showing of this on BBC America and was appauled at how much had been removed to make it fit the 1 hour time slot. The show is 1hr and 12 minutes but BBCA had cut it down to around 50 minutes to allow for commercials!I had DVR'd it to show to the kids but it no longer had any heart. They had removed much of the back-story on several of the characters and completely removed the ending turning it into simply another, mindless action show.Lesson learned - if you want to re-watch an old BBC show don't wast your time on a re-broadcast. Download from Amazon and get the whole program.Added bonus - the downloaded version (from Amazon to my Tivo) was of a vastly better picture quality than the BBCA broadcast of the same show."
2,The ones I got were Bogus not the real thing!,"I am an avid fan but when I purchase something I expect to get the real thing, not a bad reproduction with all kinds of typos, incorrect titles. Contacted the seller and was very happy with the end result but not from the original person he didn't seem to care. I had to repurchase them so now I am happy."
5,Fantastic,"Dr Who is just a great series. It stands as a very well written series that includes humor, ethics, and many other issues relevant in our world today.And of course, it really helps that the Doctor is ""the doctor"".If you enjoy quality TV (yes, there is such a thing as quality TV as there are garbage books) this is the show for you."
4,Entertaining with Great Stories,"I enjoy watching the more modern Doctor Who series, and in this particular season, I just love the Dr.'s new companion Donna Noble. If you like adventure and Sci-Fi accompanied with great actors, you'll enjoy this season of Dr. Who."
3,Doctor who s4,"purchased brand new and came with 2 broken buttons that hold the discs in. 2 of the discs will not stay in place so every time you open it the discs slide around. As for the season 4, it is okay. not ask good as s2 or s3."
1,Disks play ok but may be a bootleg,"There are obvious & blatant misspellings on the dvds. While so far the disks play ok, but I am disappointed that I have defective disks. I checked the disk size and while there are several episodes on each disk, the size seems to indicate a bootleg."
5,Christmas present for my son,This product arrived quickly and well packaged. The price was right and my son will be thrilled with it on christmas morning
3,"Great show, but beware of bootleggers!","I purchased this used off of Amazon from a seller called ""BDMarket"". The actual show itself was incredible! Catherine Tate was definitely the right way to go, companion-wise. However, the copy I received was obviously a bootleg. The plastic back that holds the discs was held in with glue that was not working at all, The episode titles on the actual discs were misspelled, there was no proof of purchase tags on the inside flap, and the audio/video quality was much less than DVD quality.Doctor Who is, without a doubt, my favorite show and this season does not disappoint. However, be careful who you buy from!"
5,Must see show,"Doctor Who is wonderfully written show. It's cast and characters are brilliant! With amazon prime you can stream most of the series. I suggest you start at the beginning , although its written in such a way that's not necessary, and enjoy!"
2,"Episode One was AWFUL, Hopefully the Rest of the Season is Less Suck","This review is for the first episode (""Voyage of the Damned"") of season one. It was absolutely THE WORST episode of Doctor Who ever. I love Doctor Who. I love David Tennant. I hated this episode with a burning passion. We went from one of the best written, most creative, and best acted episodes yet (the season 3, 3 part closer) to the absolute *worst.* ""Voyage of the Damned"" was poorly written, dreadfully cliche, heavy handed, juvenile, hackneyed, and just overall crap. Judging from the rest of the reviews raving about Seasons Four (incidently, why are all the reviews for this episode reviews of the *entire season*?), things promise to pick up, but if it's more of the same, I'm going to be very, very annoyed and sad."
3,overall good... but,the stories themselves were quite good. but donna (the companion) sucked!!! actually sucked the life out of me every time she spoke! annoying!
2,Extremely Sub-Par,"The only reason this season gets more than a single star from me is because of the exceptional writing of Steven Moffat, who penned the 'Silence in the Library' two parter late in this series, which ranks as some of the best doctor to date. The rest of the season, however, is some of the worst. Whereas Rose was a fine companion and Martha was great, our good friend the bride is simply annoying. Unlike her two predecessors, she rarely shows any intuition. All in all, i'm very happy Russel T. Davies is leaving and handing the reins over to Moffat. Can't wait for season five."
4,Great Show!,but these DVDs are WAY overpriced... Amazon should work out some deal with BBC/BBCA to get exclusive pricing....
1,wrong item,"I ordered a dvd of a tv series, and i thought that i had recieved the right item, but the wrong season was in the box... right box, wrong season!"
2,great show the box sets to expensive,i love the show but the prices beig charged for the box sets are to much for most to afford
1,Cheesy,"Another cheesy British show. I'm so disappointed as I was anticipating a great sci fi series. Instead I get a British show with...bad teeth. If you're seeking a true cerebral show, pass on this."
5,"I don't care what anyone says, Donna is one of my favorite companions.","The fourth series is definitely one of my favorites - I think the new series just got better with time. I'll admit, part of why I like it so much is because I thought it was a breath of fresh air just to have a companion who wasn't in love with the Doctor. But I love Donna for her own merits too - she's funny and snarky and not willing to put up with any crap. Tennant remains one of my favorite Doctors, and the fourth series has some of my favorite episodes of his(right before his downward spiral into depression and angst, which I did NOT like): Planet of the Ood and Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead, which are fantastic. The only part of it I don't like is the end of the finale, which, not to spoil anything, I thought was wrong and cruel. Overall, though, I love this one."
5,Doctor Who: The Complete Fourth Season,"I bought this set for my husband who had always been a Dr. Who fan. And, he loved it! We don't get the newest version in the US. So he had not seen this doctor before. It was a nice surprise for him."
3,matress cover,"I thought I was getting a great deal the cover was very thin , it rip as soon as we started to put it on the bed , in the end it was a waste of my time and money, so now I dont have a cover for my king size bed"
4,Pretty Good!,"Lights and LaddersBought it for my then 24 mo old grandson because he was watching Garbage, Firetruck videos online, so I looked for a DVD in stores but couldn't find any. This has three different scenes...the Firetruck, Street Sweeper & the Garbage truck. He likes the Garbage one the best and he will watch all three all day. Filmed in Canada in an earlier period but still quite entertaining. Us adults learned quite a bit about the different jobs and what is involved.Pretty good in interest & entertainment."
4,Fun & entertaining,"Good for kids but has pretty cheesy songs/narration. Still worth it though. This DVD does the first portion on Firetruck, then garbage trucks, then finally vehicals used in the city (like street sweepers). My kids younger kids are bored by the time the get to the last one but the older ones really enjoy it."
1,Worst Narration ever,My 3 year old enjoyed this as much as any other video of trucks driving around. It is sometimes informative as well. It is ruined by the horrible voices and the songs will make you put in ear plugs.
1,Waste of money.,The one that I received looks totally different from the one in the photo. It has been such a waste of money. I think the cooking oil from the grocery store works better than this one. I am sure this is not an argan oil. I am very very disappointed.
2,Below average,"Heat on mine doesn't work, not sure if it's broken, or it just never get's above luke warm...It feels cheap; when putting pressure on your neck are, it feels/sounds like it might break... Not terribly ergonomic, hard to get leverage, not very comfortable, and the motor isn't that powerful.It isn't very expensive, but I would say go for one of the other Wahl models for $10 more."
2,Not so great,"I just got this massager today and the heater broke! I got it to work the first time and it wasn't all that warm. Then my husband tried it and said the heat wasn't working. Sure enough, the little switch was loose and no more heat. Also, the quality isn't all that great. I got it for shoulder pain from a rotator cuff injury, but I'm going to return it and try the Wahl that got much better ratings."
3,"Works, but not what I expected","I am satisfied with it and will keep it, but the heat function is ""meh"": it doesn't heat up very fast at all. I suspect if you just left it on long enough it would get warm even with the heat off. Also, I thought the blue part on the head would rotate, but it doesn't. Weird.Anyway it's OK for the price as a basic massager. It isn't very loud and the arm is nice and long. It's fairly lightweight, but seems solid."
1,Not strong enough,"I returned this massager for it was totally worthless on my tight traps and achy rhomboids. If you are in pain, your better off with a percussion-type massager."
2,weak...,"This thing is very weak and will not give a deep tissue massage, the heat works decently but thats about all..."
4,Massager,i did not like this one as well as the Dr Scholl massager I had previously. Itdid not have as much flexibility.
3,"Ok, not great","Average, not the greatest vibration, could be stronger, but it was about what I paid for. The heating element was pretty weak too."
1,I never bought this but it shows I did,I did not buy this book. Not sure why it shows that I did and it shows 2 copies. DId not purchase.
3,BEYOND ROMANTIC LOVE,"Stan J. Katz & Aimee E. LiuFalse Love and Other Romantic Illusions(New York: Ticknor & Fields, 1988) 344 pagesFalse love is romantic infatuation.The book does a good job of describing and illustrating romantic love.But the authors identify their own style of loving--monogamous marriage--with ""true love"".They do not realize that the marriage model they support and defendis a creation of culture just as much as the romantic love they criticize.But the book is a step in the right direction.If you would like to explore other steps, search the Internet for:""The Best Books Critical of Romantic Love"".James Leonard Park, existential philosopher"
1,completely inferior product,"This product was listed as a California king though our mattress was only a king. It didn't fit, inches too small and tore as soon as we started unfolding it from the original packaging. Paid close to $30 with shipping.g and ended up just having to throw it away."
3,"Very enjoyable repertoire, very poor visually","Andre Rieu and his team are excellent musicians. The music in this concert is played very well and chosen with great taste for what seems to have been a much-appreciated outdoor concert. Alas, the camera work is awful. The cameras move much too fast, flitting from place to place and angle to angle with dizzying speed through most of the concert. The images, including too many double images, change so fast that you don't really enjoy what is happening. It is almost like being on a roller coaster! I don't know whose decision it was to film it like this, but I was very disappointed and so was my husband who watched it with me. I own three other Andre Rieu DVDs and they are much more enjoyable to watch. I do hope his future DVDs will not be like this."
2,MEDIOCRE PROGRAM AND SHORT CONCERT,"MEDIOCRE PROGRAM AND SHORT CONCERT. ALSO, ALL SPEAKING IS IN GERMAN WITH NO SUBTITLES SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT ANDRE IS SAYING UNLESS YOU KNOW GERMAN. PROGRAM IS ONLY 59 MINUTES LONG, RATHER SHORT FOR A WORLD CONCERT. ALSO, MUSIC PIECES WERE MOSTLY SLOW PIECES, NOT A VERY ROBUST CONCERT. WISH ANDRE WOULD INCLUDE ROSSINI'S ""PASSO A SEI"" IN ONE OF HIS CONCERTS."
3,deceiving title,"World tour was not the title I found right,the dvd was more like the cd (la vie est belle}.which I had on a cd,the sound and picture were ok sincerely Elly Moses"
4,"Dirt, sure. Old dirt.","Hollwood Babylon is still a good, juicy read. Which is good because everything in it is from the ""good ole days"" of Hollwood and you shouldn't think much of anything has happened in the gutter out there since around 1965. First published in the early 70's, the material this book covers was already mostly old stuff and the draw was nobody knew much about it. Then, finally, it was all there. Fatty's deathly fling? Read on. Suicide? This books got em, along with plenty of unsolved murders and Thelma Todd. If you like your scandals 20's and 30's style, this books for you."
2,FICTION AS FACT FOR THE MOST PART,"Anger's book has become the poster child for poorly-researched books on Hollywood scandal. By now, most of the reading world is aware that the book is full of half-truths, unsubstantiated rumors, and pure fiction. In addition to incredibly innacurate ""facts."" Even the sample text provided here that describes John Gilbert's death as a basis of ""A Star is Born"" is almost comically inaccurate. That movie was based upon the relationship between Barbara Stanwyck and Frank Fay. Gilbert's life had NOTHING to do with that film. No true (or self-respecting) Hollywood writer would cite Anger's book as fact or research. He's a nice man, but the book is simply Hollywood trash."
4,"A ""Must Read"" on Hollywood History","Hollywood Babylon is a definate must read for anyone interested in Hollywood history. I doubt if everything in the book is accurate. It reads like a tabloid. But all the rumours and gossip that surround the history of Hollywood are there, and it makes for interesting reading. Alot of what is written in the book is sad and disturbing. It tells the story of the bad side of Hollywood. Worth reading if you want to know all sides of the story about Hollywood."
4,A cooler Perez Hilton!,"Perez Hilton's precursor - early Hollywood scandal proving that the more things change the more they stay the same.This is full of pictures & of reminders of the Hollywood that used to be which really isn't that different than the Hollywood that is today - except that the studios took a bit more care of their stars back in the day.Witty, sly, & salacious - this is very fun."
4,Like heroin. Only way more addictive.,"Anger dishes out some absurdly titillating gossip on Hollywood celebs from the 1920s-1950s. While not all of it is terribly credible, Anger delivers his tidbits with the nasty exhilaration of a tabloid queen which makes for a fun read. But if you aren't interested in early American cinema, then there probably is little to interest you here."
4,enjoyable reading,i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. but i know better than to take everything as fact. i look at it as being gossip about the stars which may or may not be true. it's a fun read if you enjoy reading about the stars and their frailties and failures. it makes them appear all too human and not larger than life
1,terrible.,"There is hardly any text in this book. It's all pictures of hollywood stars in lewd positions. Marylin Monroe's pubic hair, Joan Crawford and another girl in flagrant delicto, and the writing is incredibly boring. Lighten up Kenneth. This book is ruined by your bitterness. I'm sorry if the hollywood of the old days is sour grapes for you."
3,"Morbid, sleazy, inky","Hollywood's underbelly. Takes me back to the 50's when I was a little girl and saw inky, grainy pictures of actresses in tabloids who were either drug addicts or found dead. Because I didn't understand dope addiction or suicide, those photos seemed mysterious like pictures taken of ghosts. The two most horrific pictures in this book are Jayne Mansfield's dog decapitated and Ginger Rogers without makeup."
1,Interesting similarities to another book,"Some passages in ""Hollywood Babylon II"" strongly echo ""Hollywood's Unsolved Mysteries,"" an obscure pulp paperback by John Austin, written in 1969-1970.""The girl's head was frightfully battered but that was the least of it"" (""Hollywood's Unsolved Mysteries,"" Page 82, Black Dahlia case).""The victim's head had been bashed almost beyond recognition-but that wasn't the worst of it."" (Hollywood Babylon II, Page 127-130, Black Dahlia case)."
2,Unsubstantiated mean gossip,"The author's motto seems to be if it didn't happen this way it should have. Some good pictures, but overall it is just a bitter wannabe's look at Hollywood."
1,"Stupid, dumb, boring,not even good trash!!","Don't waste your money!! Everyone in this book is ancient(and dead) most person's in this book were born in the 1920's. Most of them I never heard of. Ok Judy Garland,(everyone knows she died on the toliet) Jane Mansfield, nothing new here, the picture of the dead dog was no big deal. The way the book was written half the time it was unclear what the author was saying, there is not any good trash in this book, if you want a better read I would suggest the book by Christopher Kennedy Lawford about his own life and those around him such as the Kennedys and many celebrities."
1,this is ( ),"do not read this book if you are looking for any sort of accuracy, it's about as factual as a grocery store tabloid. if you are just looking for a no-brainer read, then this is for you, but if you are interested in hollywood history, pass it by."
1,"Rumor, exaggeration, half lies and boring truths. Yawn.","This is a very overrated book. Kenneth Anger (a resentful egotist who made some of the most tedious and uninteresting movies of the 20th century) preserved all the idle gossip and quasi-true stories of early hollywood and its stars. The stuff that is true (if you can figure out which is which) is either dull, common knowledge or unbelieveably depressing. To be taken with several grains of salt."
1,"If You Like To Read Lies, This Book Is For You","Hollywood Babylon is filled with inaccuracies and slander, but if that's your cup of tea, go for it."
2,"SICK, SICK, SICK!","Hollywood Babylon is like the movie, ""Alive,"" in that it was great, but so sickening, you're not sure whether or not you want to recommend it to anyone. If you're of the faint of heart and want to hold onto cherished memories of the Golden Age of Hollywood, don't read it at all; you will be grossed out completely and may even lose your mind from the depravity. If you're of a stronger constitution, you may like it, but be prepared for grisly photos of dead people, revolting scandals and disgusting incidents. But if you're just a sick puppy, this book's for you! I, for one, am not one, so I gave it three stars. I would've given it four, but I had to deduct a point for the Tackyness Factor (c'mon--did we really need to see a picture of Jayne Mansfield's mangled dead dog after her fatal car crash? Yeeesh!). At any rate, buy this book if you like, but remember--you've been warned!"
3,Gift,"Can't review this book as it was a gift for my wife who freaked over Hollywood Babylon and the way she reacted to this book it was just as good, I think."
4,Very Unique,"This film is very unique. If you can overlook how cheaply it was made, and believe me, that alone will be a tough task, you will be pleasantly surprised as to how funny it is.Max Gardens plays Dr Breedlove over the top and is consistently hilarious throughout the entire film. The plot, what there is of one, consists of an alien (Frank Coe) coming to earth to seek the perfect female speciman. Of course, Dr Breedlove is the 'onestop' he needs to make. The models used are all attractive and are reasonably well built. Althea Currier never looked better than she did in this film. She will really knock your socks off. She's the total package. No wonder Russ Meyer used her in three films. Blondes Claudia Banks and Jackie DeWitt are also in the film.The DVD also offers commentary by producer Harry Novak. I think this film is a must buy for any lover of the 'nudie cutie' era."
3,No shock - All schlock!,"Schlock lovers will undoubtedly enjoy this feast o'fun...I did! What plot? Half-bare semi-babes and moth-eaten monsters cavort in sexless activities with very bad puns...seemingly lifted out of the early issues of Famous Monsters Magazine. The girls do their best to be sexy, wetting their lips in close-up but they only induce laughter. ""Kiss Me Quick"" has a Stan Laurel-type character while ""House On Bare Mountain"" features a Jonathan Winters/Maude Frickert character. Does this help the plot? No, but it just makes it more enjoyable. If you're still in the dark about what these films are about, so am I...and I watched the darn things! It's very bad, but that makes it good. Add this to your monster film collection - but keep it out of range of the kiddies!"
3,Dollar store quality,It is exactly same in quality as extension cord you will find in dollar store or at Walmart. Only thing is you cant find a 20' long extension cord there. It is hard to push plug in it as it doesn't go all the way in. It is working but definitely dollar store quality.
1,Unbelievable!,"My daughter had been given this book in church and I promptly called to complain. This book basically uses scare tactics to keep young women from exploring their sexuality in a healthy way. The authors warn about the temptation of masturbation, homosexuality and boys who only want ""one thing"". In Part II, avoiding self-destruction, in reference to masturbation it states, ""Simply praise God and be determined to resist this temptation if it ever sneaks up on you."" It also cautions young women not to do anything they wouldn't do right in front of their parents. Unless your looking for something that fuels the extreme right-wing propaganda machine I would not advise you to purchase this book. I would have given it 0 stars, but I couldn't find that option."
4,XV6700 battery,I ordered a xv6700 replacement battery for my PPC phone on the 3rd of July and i received the battery on the 10th. I was very satisfied with the battery and the quick shipment.
1,"This is not the movie, It's the commentary","I ordered the movie ""Severance"" to watch instantly. However, what I got was not the movie, but the commentary track. Someone at Amazon must have made a mistake but I can't reach anyone to solve the error. Please fix the problem and return my money."
5,Great Live Record,"This is a great live record. It sounds awesome on vinyl, much better than any digital device I have heard it on. A must have for true Floyd fans"
5,An important contribution,"I think this is one of the most important contributions to the anthropology of South Asia in the last twenty years. It rings profoundly true and helps us understand Indian civic identity in a manner unmatched previously in the literature. Mines finds a way to critique Dumont while not forgetting his important contributions. It provides an entirely new way to look at Indian identity and civic life - by thinking of an individuality which is defined by the relationships that a person has with others - but that leaves room for a sense of self. This is important readfing for political scientists, economists, as well as anthropologists, and would also be helpful to those in the development world working on demand-driven approaches."
4,"Great Monitor, Lousy Speakers","The Planar PE191M is a very good LCD monitor for the price. It worked perfectly out of the box and is very bright. However, the built in speakers are the worst I've ever heard. I use the monitor for business applications so its fine for me."
2,Not worth it,"This is a profile of Ting Ling, a Taiwanese swimsuit model. She is a beautiful woman, and the DVD is a collection of low key vignettes showing her on fashion shoots and with her boyfriend with some voice commentary; (in Chinese, with no translation). There are plenty of topless and swimsuit shots and, as stated, she is very attractive. My two big complaints are the low picture quality and high price. It looks like the work of a film student using a basic camcorder and editing equipment. This is not at all consistant with the high price. This DVD would need higher production values and cost half as much to be a good value."
5,Outstanding,"Out of all 700 classical CDs I own, this is my favorite. Opening with St. Paul's Suite (Holst) and ending with the romping sword dance from Warlock's Capriol Suite, this CD is wonderful English string music from beginning to end. It's hard to believe there's only 11 members of the ensemble because of their full sound. The music is gorgeous, the interpretation is lovely, and the recording is clean. It is a must-have for anyone who likes the pieces on the album."
2,Wonderful book but...,"The Bhagavad Gita by Winthrop Sargeant is probably one of the best translations and it fits into your pocket! That's the good part. Unfortunately, as soon as you open the book, all pages come apart. The quality of the binding is extremely poor and that's the reason I gave only two stars for the book."
1,Heritage Foundation for middle schoolers,"I quite agree with the author that personal responsibility, ethics, choices, and consequences are primary to a person's successful functioning. I also agree it's primary to ""teach a man to fish,"" rather than giving him a fish. Where we part company is how to bring that teaching about. What emerges here is a thin and regurgitated paean to a utopian free-market system, again bending poor old Adam Smith's words to the intent of the privatize/deregulate crowd, while blithely skipping over the infinity of human complexity, actual (as opposed to sanitized and imagined) history, and the recent/current demonstrations of political and fiscal irresponsibility we're shuddering through as we speak. In a phrase: don't bother."
1,Awful Tech Support,"When this thing works, it's fine. But if anything goes wrong, you're SOL.I had to reset my router, which means it defaults to an unencrypted state. To re-set encryption, you have to go to a web address. The site no longer exists -- or at least it's been down for the past few days. The ""24/7"" tech support number is a joke -- I've been on hold now for two hours. (I'm on hold as I write this!) I've written e-mail, no response. Are these guys even still in business?Buyer beware!"
1,This is one consumer hostile company!,"I have tried repeatedly to contact cust support since their cd software was written impproperly and cannot even be read on a screen---Without the software you cannot setup this unit for proper operation and their tech support is absolutely clueless and tells you to go to cust support who then tells you to go to tech supportI have been waiting for the antenna, cd and cable that I was supposed to have received with this unit and the hsb1 access point for over 3 months now and call or email at least once every two weks to only be met with frustration and total lack ofcivility or knowledge of their product OR the english language and ability to even communicate with rudimentary common english termsDONT even consider wasting your money on any of this companys products as it is all money down the drain"
1,Very Disappointed,I purchased this item with a 14dbi antenna and my Linksys wireless g network card has better rang. For some reason it is picky on which networks it likes. eventually it got hot some how and melted the casing. If you ask me this item should be under review by Hawking.
4,Hawking Wireless G AP/Bridge,For advanced configuration use the web interface instead of the installation program. Once it is up and running it works great until the power goes out during a storm. After a power outage it may take a power cycle or two to get the network back online but it is rock solid with no problems any other time.Highly recommend for a wireless point-to-point bridge between two wired networks with one of these on each end!Wish it had diagnostics available via the web interface.If you don't understand how to configure wireless devices it can be difficult to configure properly.
2,Not worth buying,"I bought this DVD hoping that it would have the videos that MTV and BET doesn't play anymore. It did, but with very bad quality. In all honesty, this DVD looked like a bootleg. In fact, I believe it's from a public access cable show.The picture and sound were poor and often the words ""Make It or Break It Videos"" would scroll across the screen during the videos. If you're looking for good sound and picture quality, I don't recommend this. If you're just looking for the videos, then this is more of your liking. Nothing against the stores that sell it, only the company that made it."
1,Run over by bus,"The CD's came to me looking like the case had been run over by a bus, so I thought it would be an appropriate heading. I have no idea how the music sounds since I can't play them. Tried to work it out with customer support, but the email Shena sent and its associated survey had already been 'handled' before I read it or responded to it. So I end up with a useless crushed box set, but it sure has taught me a very valuable lesson. And it wont happen again!"
5,WHAT A GREAT BOOK AND PURCHASE,BOOK RECEIVED IN TWO DAYS. ALL ABOUT FIGHTING THE WAR OF PROCRASTINATION WHICH I FOUGHT HEARTILY TO GET THIS REVIEW UP. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS BOOK FROM THIS SELLER AND ALSO BUYING THE BOOK IN GENERAL AS THE AUTHOR OFFERS A GREAT PERSPECTIVE ON SHOWING UP FOR YOUR MUSE/CREATIVITY/YOURSELF.
3,Decent,"Maybe this book didn't resonate with me as much as others because I don't have a major problem with The Resistance, as many do. I just get things out there: books, blog posts, videos, etc. But that's me. It's a little self-help and I would have appreciated a few more concrete steps and examples."
3,Worth reading....,"This book had some good tips, and it was an easy read. It's nothing revolutionary, but it does motivate you a bit to get off your butt and want to complete an art project."
2,Nuggets of Wisdom in a Sea of Oddball Spirituality,"The book starts of reasonably well defining our problem as resistance and how it manifests itself. Then it goes into some ways to overcome resistance which boil down to, ""be a professional and get down to work."" Then the wackiness ensues. The author brings out an amalgamation of Eastern mysticism, Greek mythology, Zen Buddhism, and most any other form of spirituality you can think of to call upon to inspire you."
1,Generic motivational advice,"There is nothing remotely creative about this book. It's a small book, too, a quick read, but not worth the time or money."
1,Resistance is...,"...reading this book! It's cynicism and judgemental view toward others was a big turn-off. The author may think he's on the right path, but has yet to realize these same attitudes are a form of Resistance also. Therefore, ""the war of art"" lacks credibility."
4,Worth your time,"There are some very good ideas and suggestions presented. I got a little turned off by the ""higher power"" emphasis. It's the same problem that I had with Julia Cameron's ""The Artist's Way"". I'm really a nuts and bolts type person and the quasi-religious approach to seeking inspiration doesn't really resonate for me. It may for other people. There was enough good content that I just skipped over that section."
5,Great Book,"Simple, insightful and honest book that makes you want to be better and do more. Read this if you are stuck on anything."
4,Decent book,"This was an enjoyable book to read. Seems the better self-help books have a simple premise: you have to actually put in the effort and do the work. Just being a couch potato reading self-help books doesn't really work. Its like reading Men's Health and expecting to get in shape without actually going to the gym. I didn't find the book to offer life-changing advice, but it was still a good read. Remember...it takes effort, not just the want of effort."
5,Simple and easy read - and a great reminder to get over yourself!,"A client of mine recommended this book to me as she was writing her book. I'm always up for a great book on writing, creating, and what stops up from reaching that potential, and actually going after what we want or what we are being called to do. What I loved about this book was the simplicity of the concepts and ideas. I also loved the style in how it was presented, in short little blurbs and not long, in-depth chapters. There were so many nuggets of wisdom, that I can't wait to go back and extract them in more depth. I did a lot of underlining, but mostly I read parts and said ""Humph.... that's interesting."" It caused me to really think about my resistance in a different way. When any book gets me to think, I love it. It's a great pocket guide, or book to skim through when you feel you are up against resistance. I definitely recommend it to my book writing clients!"
4,A fresh way of looking at creative blocks,"This book says what we all know who are trying to create, write, or complete project: we are blocked by resistance. It is written in short insights, one per page, so it is easily picked up and put down. It does take a long time to get around to proffering the advice of how to counter the resistance, but it is there. It is not new information but a fresh way of looking at the situation and then dealing with it. It may be helpful depending on just what is causing your ""resistance"" or it may just point out the problems you were already aware of."
3,Just do it,"This book is a pep talk if you need one. The Nike slogan is about as deep. Anyway, if you need a pep talk - go ahead and buy it. If not let me save you some money: ""Get off your rear end and just do it."" and also ""try to make sure it is the right thing."" The trick this book is trying to teach is if you want to write you have to discipline yourself to put pen or pencil to the paper (or whatever other tool whatever other discipline you are in requires.) Not to be too cruel - his method does work . . . but man, this guy clearly has a concept of adversity that only the spoiled and pampered could have. There, save some money, if the the author believes what he is saying he won't mind you saving that buck."
2,Disappointing,"If you believe in muses and angels and that the act of your writing is just a manifestation of some higher power you might enjoy this book. If not, run!"
1,Use Resistance for Good and Buy Something More Useful,"I tried to like this book. It was recommended by a couple of people I really respect, but I hated it. I thought the writing was horrible and to me everything could have been said in a couple of pages instead of dragging it into a ""book"".As someone with a love for art and a dozen projects constantly in the works, I constantly struggle with resistance and often lose. Though I can honestly say I feel no more motivated or empowered to overcome resistance than if the author had simply said, ""Just get off your butt and do it."" Because basically that is the answer.To each his own, but this book was a waste of time and money for me."
2,Too much mambo-jambo IMHO,"I just don't understand how this book got so many positive reviews. I've read and to me this is way too much esoteric talk saying things about ""It was resistance!"" and things like that and very few actual actionable stuff that you can use.Maybe I just didn't get it, but if you are anything like me (not very much into esoteric mambo jambo and like to get the facts) then I would stay away from this book."
3,Interesting Rants,"This book is all over the place. The main premise is that we are all placed on this planet to do ""one thing"" and that we need to do it. We don't do this ""one thing"" because of ""resistance"", which takes many forms, all of which are trying to keep us from doing our ""one thing"". Pressfield writes in short chapters that cover one topic, giving the book a very choppy feel. Though I can appreciate the message of this book - go do what you are called to do - I would look for that message somewhere else."
5,The Most Important Book I've Ever Read,"If you are an artist or have a creative vision or are an entrepreneur, or if you are merely trying to achieve a personal dream: READ THIS BOOK. Alternately poetic and blunt, author Steven Pressfield is brilliantly succinct and powerfully motivating. This is definitely a book to own and to revisit. Brilliant."
5,Top notch for cultivating professionalism,"I find what Pressfield has to say about professionalism and resistance to be invaluable - sobering, reassuring and highly motivating. However, the War of Art is not just for creative types. The book about inner resistance, how to recognize it and how to do battle with it. It is a book for warriors, whether you are an artist, athlete, or any professional who is serious about becoming a master in your domain.I definitely plan to read the sequel. Thank you J Michael Dolan (the blog) for recommending Pressfield's books."
3,Book is aimed mostly at writers.,"I got this book due to Amazon's recommendation. The book is mostly about the author's battle with procrastination and his long, drawn out plan for dealing with it. Along the way is thrown in his belief in most major religions, some minor religions and also Greek mythology and Angels. The book is mostly aimed at authors, but it's message can be used by most other professions also. It basically could have been summed up in one sentence - Get to work."
5,LOVE it!,"Fab book: relevant, articulate, simple, profound. Every creative person should read this. I'm buying 10 for my dearest friends and family."
5,My Personal Figth with Resistance!,"We ALL have those little voices that go like ""Go do it"" and ""Not do not do it"".This book is phenomenal to help you win over YOU, when you conquer YOU, You win."
2,easily read in a couple of hours,I expected more from this book. I found it a bit fluffy with not much in take away ideas or inspirations.
5,JUDO CHOP to resistence in the creative arts.,Steven Pressfield does an excellent job of exposing the battle between paralysis and action in the act of creation and how all the stakes escalate the more deeply and passionately we feel about the art we are attempting to drag from our soul into the physical plane. An encouraging address of the personal resistance people face in the creative process and a guide to acting like a pro until you are one. It felt like an AA meeting. These were shameful things you just don't talk about. The exposure of our deepest fears of failure and success were inspiring in light of his nearly 4 decades of working on his craft before reaching success. He concludes that it is our love for the thing that calls to us that will see us through.
5,The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Y...,"This was an excellent book. Puts into perspective the war and battle we rage within ourselves and work environments to have ""ART"" in whatever we profess to do. It was a great book, easy to read, I had a hard time putting the book down. I have recommended it to all of my children; it would benefit them in their chosen careers. Thank you. Kathy Chaney"
5,Lessons from the Hard Knocks School,"This was a little gem of a book, several evolutionary steps away from the treacly psycho-babble of a self-help book. It's really a series of simple lessons derived from the author's successes and (more often) failures, all linked with the not very touchy-feely theme of ""get off your butt and get to work."" The lessons apply to anything in life that requires risk, sacrifice, and creativity to accomplish. Buy it."
1,what?,"Apparently this is a self-help book. Hard to say.If it has helped some people, good for them. I open it and see nothing but a bunch of self-absorbed, mystical mumbo jumbo. None of it is original, much of it doesn't even make sense.My advice: if you're tempted by all those 5-star reviews, check it out at the library before you buy.There's much, much, better stuff in this genre. You want a recommendation?Improv Wisdom: Don't Prepare, Just Show Up"
2,More about procrastination than creativit,"If you have already read psychology books dealing with the topic of procrastination(in this book called resistance), then you might find this book a little bit boring.It is more kind of an essay about this topic from the perspective a professional writer (a person who wants to be creative) than a handbook how to fight it. If you are interested in the topic of procrastination, I would rather recommend to read the chapter about procrastination from the book Feeling Good. Or recently I read the book Power of full engagement, which is addressing this topic as well and offer more tricks."
2,good advice followed by kooky philosophy,"I'll be honest: if I hadn't been listening to this as an audio book, and if it hadn't been a day when I was working as an extra, I wouldn't have finished this book. Not even close.There is some good, solid advice on craft and discipline in the first few chapters, but then Pressfield starts talking about golf and angels and God and other things which, belief aside, I'm not really interested in. I don't want to hear your kooky opinions or half-baked theories about the nature of the universe. And his implication that cancer is merely a symptom of people's unfulfilled dreams is offensive to anyone who's ever lost a family member to the disease.It's not nearly as bad as Dilbert creator Scott Adams going off the rails, but like I said, if I hadn't been stuck on set with few other entertainment options, I would have dropped it long before the end."
1,Rambling and at times mindnumbing,The beginning of the section regarding Resistance was interesting but then it seemed to take off into some alternate universe. never really gave any direction on how to deal with or get past the Resistance. Did not find useful at all.
1,Boring Book Of Drama. Don't Buy This,"This book is a wast of money. Don't buy it. The author overly dramatizes art. He feels so much resistance in writing. Well, I guess I would too if I attempt to write a whole book about it. Ok taking aside that I don't agree with what he's saying, this book essentially doesn't contain enough intellectual content. When reading this book, I can feel the author trying very hard to put in as much text as he can into an already saturated topic. A real looser. I want my money back."
5,So inspiring,I am in a very similar situation as the author. Reading this book gives me courage to move on. Thanks for authoring this book!
4,great book,the book makes you look at your artist abilities in a new and different light so will enjoy it more
5,fear shatterer,"A great book if you have reservations about anything holding you back. Shows how to move forward and push through your fears to get in touch, or back in touch with your creative self. Highly reccomend it."
5,Great book!,"Great book that everyone, no matter if you're an entrepreneur, painter, writer, or just someone in search of his/her place in the world, should read. Highly recommended. Also recommend Pressfield's other book on the subject, ""Do The Work."""
5,Straight to the Heart,The war of arts spoke straight to me as I read this in almost one sitting. I could not put it down and I am more than sure will be reading it again. There is always resistane and sometimes the resistance is where you need to be going. Stop the fear and go!See ya on facebook: angelambrooks [...]
5,Practical and Powerful,"Pressfield's book is practical guide that is both supportive and realistic. He explains in simple terms a most basic lesson that most creativity guides talk around for pages: Productivity is hard work. The book appeals to the pragmatist as much as the dreamer, encouraging resolve, wisdom, and drive to achieve tangible representations of creativity.I keep it on my desk for daily words of encouragement.Personally, I appreciate his ability to speak to all readers- his eye is trained on equity of gender and spirituality. As an atheist woman, it's refreshing to feel spoken to in equal measure as other readers, particularly when dealing with ineffable issues of creativity and spirit.If you are an artist of any kind, this book is essential."
2,"Valuable (short), then tedious (long)","How many stars for a valuable 8-page article surrounded by a repetitive 165-page book?Two--because the breathless style, the preachy overstatement, and the thoughtless repetition became so irritating by page 65.Read the first eight pages in the library or bookstore (or in-flight magazine)."
4,A good kick in the butt.,"All artist's need help with motivation at some point. This was a good quick self-help for getting going. It's not really a war of art, more like a war with self. And one hopes the art comes out on top."
4,Great Book from a Talented Author,"I enjoyed Pressfield's Gates of Fire, Tides of War, the Afghan Campaign - then I found this, and much to my delight, he shares his views on being creative - not simply being an author, but being an effective human in life. I loaned the book to a friend, who liked it so much I bought her a copy as a gift. Pressfield's talent doesn't just go to the very well researched historical fiction; this work is motivational and succinct enough that it makes a very good audio book. Well worth reading (or listening to) for a change of pace."
4,"If you want to be a pro at _________, read this book !","Very simple book that had a powerful impact on me personally. If you are self employed it can be an especially strong reminder of what it takes to succeed.Set the excuses aside and read it, worth your time and money."
3,Like a cup of coffee - works but doesn't last,"Nothing completely mindblowing or enlightening really, but definitely energizing and motivating for anyone in a lull, particularly creative folk. It's like a cup of coffee or popping a speed pill - gets you pumped for sure, but of short-lived effect."
3,it's ok,"It's approach towards the topic of interest is way too romantic, It feels unprofessional, friendly and amateur.It has a touch of ""self-help"" genre that is not coherent with my expectations, as I was expecting a professional - or rather interesting- analysis of the creative process."
3,"Nice little ""rah-rah"" book.","Some of the reviews are almost longer than this book!I chose this book to offer a little encouragement. In that respect, it delivered. This is what I categorize as a ""bathroom book,"" something to keep on the back of the tank to peruse for a few minutes. It will get you going (in life), provided you have your own ambition.The author does make some silly statements along the lines of 'Tolstoy had 13 kids & HE managed to crank out work.' No credit to Mrs. Tolstoy!"
3,Okay,"This seemed a little angry to me and a lot more man completely controls his universe and corporate America is evil than I expected. Still several of the chapters appealed to me as an artist. It's an easy to read book that basically says if you want to be an artist, practice your art. Several quotable quotes."
1,Unseless rambling and blank pages,"Honestly, this is one of the most useless and poorly written books I've ever had the misfortune to waste money on in a long time. The only good advice the author gives is to dedicate yourself to your art, and keep at it every day. Make it a priority. There, I saves you the cost of the book! The rest is nonsensical rambling interspersed with full and half-blank pages. Don't waste your money!"
2,Dissapointed,"I was expecting this to be a real winner by reading the reviews.It was actually a dud! There are a few gems in the material, but it's hardly worth the postage.Perhaps if you find it at a yard sale for 50cents!"
2,Resistance,"The author starts off really strong about the effect of resistance, along with some great insight on moving forward. Then in the middle of the book he comes apart at the seams, rambling on about muses and angles, artists and the rest of the pathetic world of non-artists. The end picks up with some good ideas. I'm glad I read it. Wouldn't give it as a gift."
2,"Some good affirmations, heavily padded with a lot of new-age garbage.","I honestly do not know why or how this has so many five star reviews. First thing is first; this is not a book. It's a bloated inspirational pamphlet. It's about 120 pages, with most pages only containing one or two paragraphs.(not-so-cleverly aping the style of Sun Tzu's The Art of War) I like the writer's concept of ""The Resistance"" (a.k.a. writer's block) However, from early on he begins injecting a lot of very generic and pseudo-spiritual buzzwords and phrases. Some parts of the book come off almost like Scientology indoctrination. I'm sure there are a lot of people who found this a great motivational tool, but I'm sure they would have just as easily gotten the same fulfillment from reading ""The Secret"" or anything Tony Robbins has written."
2,The War of Art,"I had been advised to read this book but it it dealt with subjects I was not really interested in, and nothing for a beginning writer that made any sense to me."
1,If THE OFFICE's David Brent wrote a book on creativity...,"...it would be this.Ugh, just a book of empty words, poor prose, and cliches. Fortunately it was short. I have no idea how it has so many 5-star reviews."
2,Don't care for this book,"I don't really like this book or the format or maybe it's his voice in the writing. I suppose based on what I've read so far this is just another form of procrastination? I'm sure it's helpful to others, this is just my opinion at this point of my journey."
4,"Accessible, Inspirational Writing!","I'm glad I ordered this book as I found that as soon as I had received it I could not put it down. I subscribe to Steven Pressfield's blog and don't always agree with what he has to say, however I found this slim tome quite relevant to my everyday life and how procrastination often gets in the way. I would recommend this book to friends, especially those with an artistic inclination. I would also recommendThe Artist's Wayby Julia Cameron. This book runs along the same lines, but it gives more practical advice about how to overcome blocks."
4,Motivating,"This book did motivate me to pursue my artistic endeavors more consistently, especially the last few pages. however, I was disappointed to see that the author felt the need to sprinkle profanity here and there to get his point across. Pressfield primarily focuses on our battle with resistance and gives practical information on how to go about conquering this enemy. I just wish he could have resisted the use of vulgar words to accomplish his artistic pursuit."
2,"Ah,...blah","I liked his description and use of ""resistance"" which is another term for writer's block or lack of motivation. He made some very good points for artists and writers.However, he did drag on a bit too much about certain points. After awhile it just got silly with the talk about angels and other BS."
5,Fantastic,"Really amazing work. Just re-read the Resistance and Fundamentalism chapter again and sighed a ""wow"" at the end. Not much of a review writer, but I had to stop by and say thank you so much for writing this book."
5,Inspirational and Effective,"I bought The War of Art by Stephen Pressfield based upon a recommendation by Joe Rogan from Mr. Rogan's podcast. I admit a small reluctance to the purchase as my only writing background was as a reporter for my law school newspaper. With this background, what could I gain from this book? The answer came to me quite quickly upon the read. His discussion of the procrastination-building and ennui-inducing powers which hinder our chosen endeavors is relatable to affairs of art, affairs of the heart, your career and your overall enjoyment of life. He calls this power ""resistance,"" and I was able to extrapolate a solid program to overcome resistance to my many endeavors through his discussion. I read and re-read this book in two days. It is an engaging read, and I highly recommend it."
3,Repetitive but Relevant,"I have read many a Steven Pressfield novel and love and appreciate his prose. This book was no different in my respect for him, a glance into the world of the artist and the daily weight we find pressing upon our shoulders - that which Pressfield dubs Resistance.Essentially the books tells us this: We are artists > something is keeping us from producing our art > label it Resistance > we must overcome Resistance > success will follow.The book is a good read if you're looking for one-liners to inspire you, but I don't see much distinct advantage to reading it, honestly. It's redundant, but I think that's intentional.If you're in a slump and need a pick-me-up, this is the book for you. Otherwise, keep truckin.""The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death."""
5,empowering book,"Pressfield is the Major General and he's earned his right to lead. He says, ""Don't overcome your fear... as if you could. Instead, know your enemy very well."" Your enemy, Resistance, goes by many names (you'll recognize them all) and every one is a small demon with an Achille's heel. The format of the book is ideal for focus, with chapters of one or two pages each; enough meat to chew and digest, one bite at a time. And it's REAL. No fluffy cheerleading or coddling self-help; no, it's a call to responsibility and clarity. The scales fell from my self-deluded little eyes and my expectations have deflated down to workable dimensions. And I'm writing! Without my usual angst and procrastination and transparent excuses! Give this book to people you love."
5,The perfect kick in the pants,"This book is amazing. It's very brief, but the type of book that's so packed with wisdom that you'll re-read it multiple times. Whether you're blocked, can't start, in a rut, whatever - this book will kick start your spirit. Highly recommended."
2,A few too many religious connotations for me,"As someone who wants to write but struggles, this book seemed like it might be right up my alley. Unfortunately I found it a bit too oblique to be much use.It essentially characterises your writer's block and lack of motivation as this powerful force called 'resistance' that is apparently lurking everywhere and trying to distract us and hold us back at every corner. Even ignoring the obvious biblical connotations of that, it's a bit too dramatic for me.The word 'angel' crops up quite often too, and while the author does briefly touch on the fact that you can substitute that word for muse if you're not a believer, it doesn't change the overall feeling and direction of the book.In terms of content, I found the book pretty short, and lacking on actual practical advice. There's a few useful tips scattered throughout, but all in all it wasn't for me."
4,The Gospels,"The Cornerstone Biblical Commentary on Matthew-Mark uses the text of the New Living Translation. It is just the kind of commentary that a busy pastor can appreciate. Using first rate scholars, it it solid in exegesis, clear in explanation, and concise in commentary. Without a large investment in time, you can walk away with the information you need to put together a lesson or a sermon. I highly recommend it."
3,Ok for children who have basic reading skills,"The ""Read-It! Readers"" series of books begin with the purple level which presents basic topics and objects using high frequency words and simple language patterns. The red level books present familiar topics using common words and repeating sentence patterns. My 5-year-old who already has some basic reading skills found this book to be mildly engaging. The story is about a little boy Joe who does not like to participate in Track and Field Day as he feels he is too slow. But then this particular year, he finds he has an aptitude for balancing things and makes the most of it. The story is ok, just not very interesting (at least for my child). Some advanced words in here - balancing, decided, excited, arrived, cheering (to give an idea of the vocabulary being used).This might suit a child who already has some reading skills and has sufficient vocabulary, including familiarity with word endings such as -ed and -ing."
1,Disappointment and Unfairness,"What a letdown! I, too, had hoped for a boxed set at a reasonable price. The Roloffs are a marvelous family, and their adventures are such treats amid alternate programming riddled with sex and profanity. To see what these people have made of their lives is truly inspirational, and the work that Matt does for the benefit of little people everywhere is nothing short of admirable. For TLC to market their shows in this disgusting, capitalizing way is a real slap in their faces, a bold statement that their work is not considered important enough to market for any purpose other than greed, i.e. another blatant injustice thrown in their paths."
1,Not made in USA!,"I have no review of the product because I immediately shipped it back to amazon for a full refund upon it's arrival due to the fact that it is not made in USA as described, but rather made in Indonesia. This should be changed on this website, but in case they don't, I'm here to inform you all."
4,Decent Grill Cover,I gave this grill cover as a gift to my Mom who is a dedicated Steeler fan. While I will admit this isn't the most heavy duty cover ever made it did survive for two years at my parents place. My thought is that the white reflected the light better than a darker color which seems to be the standard cover color on most grills. It's fun and for the price held up for a reasonable amount of time.
4,does the job,This product is a very good value for the price. The only thing to keep in mind is that whent eh power goes out you must reset the timer. This timer comes on at dusk and stays on the number of hours desired. When the power goes out you must select the mode and the length of time again.I had three and purchased a coulpe more. So far no complaints and I owned this timer model for a couple years.
2,Not too great,"This was obviously made before Blank's ""Tae-Bo Inc."" was set in motion and Tae-Bo became the phenom it is today. I feel I should have just paid more and bought Tae-Bo."
3,Very intense and excellent if done correctly,"For those that are complaining about Billy Blanks not explaining the moves and not knowing the proper way to expedite them, obviously skipped the instructional tape and jumped right into the basics or advanced. I have a very good workout after doing the basics due to the proper movements and positioning that Mr. Blanks has explained in the instructional tapes. If there is no pain, there is no gain. And if there is no pain, then you have not done the workouts properly."
1,Wasn't what I expected,I have tried the series of 4 other videos I love the energy I recieved from working out with the video. I purchaced this video and was extremly disappointed with it I was expecting some thing more along the lines of the other videos. How can I get a refund. Andrea
3,"Got me moving, but a little confusing.","This video is ok, it teaches you the basics, but is a little confusing because he moves from one move to another very quickly without really explaining what he is doing."
1,"Though this workout is inexpensive, it's still not worth it.","This video appears to be a low-budget screening for participants in the more advertised Tae-Bo Workout video set (evidenced by a much less fit particpant that's in the Tae-Bo Workout). Explanations for moves are slow-coming while the people in the background are doing the moves. By the time Billy Blanks gets done with the explanation, they're done doing the move. The tape is also not as motivating and is not a good workout. Overall, I didn't feel like I accomplished anything while doing this video. I don't even feel like I worked out. This video is not worth the money I paid for it."
3,Fun but Boring,I expected the video to be the full 45 minutes in one workout instead it was split into two. Although I do get a good workout I feel that there were lots of cuts and spliced parts in the video that threw me off a bit. Overall I have go decent results with this video but I am going to go ahead and go with the Advanced Tae Bo set....it would be more intense and effective than this one I feel.
2,Not Billy's Best Work,"I love kickboxing and tae bo . . . I have several different tapes that I use. This tape was one big mistake. The workout has no continuity, the camera work is awful, and Billy moves so fast that I had no idea what he was doing. I would recommend Billy's Blanks Tae Bo series before I would ever recommend this tape."
2,Disappointing!,"This video left me wondering when the real workout was going to start! It consisted of 2 short kickboxing workouts, the first of which you don't even break a sweat. The second workout was a little better but I had to do a bit more jumping around and more repetitions than they did. I found it very strange that Billy Blanks doesn't even instruct for most of the video..the people in the background are doing the moves. It seemed very hastily made and I'm disapointed that I spent money on this! I don't think I'll be purchasing other Billy Blanks videos anytime soon!"
1,A waste of money,"I need something a bit more challenging than this. Talk about boring...i'm so ticked I wasted my money...too slow didn't break a sweat and definetly not energetic. Billy just doesn't have a ""pump you up"" attitude in this video. It's BLAH!"
4,Great to get motivated,"It took me 3 months to finally get going and this video was a great way to start. There was enough of a warm up and slow down to satisfy my aching muscles (I am not very athletic), and now that I have mastered this tape, I am ready for the higher aerobic impact of the advanced video. If it helped to motivate me, it can for anyone!"
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"I own the complete set of Tae-Bo tapes. This one is by far the worst of the series. You never really get a chance to get into the workout. He always cuts off the exercise before you feel any of its benefits. I reiterate, Don't waste your money!"
1,Don't buy this if you expect a workout,This tape shows the very basic moves in Taebo. It is choreographed with advanced students and there is little instruction. It does not provide a proper warm up or cool down and spends too little time on the actual combinations. I would not recommend this tape - to do it live - much more fun!
1,If you Taebo ... you'll hate this video!!,"For anyone who already ""TaeBo's"" this is not the same. The video is pre-coreographed and VERY hard to follow. The workout is not nearly as good even if you can manage to halfway follow the moves! The people in the video aren't really used to "" taeboing"" anyway. Save your money and buy more Taebo videos!"
3,quite pleased so far,"I bought this tape yesterday. When I brought it home last night I put it in just to get the ""jest"" of things. I wound up doing the moves at 9:00 pm! I had a blast and couldn't wait until I could spend more time on it today.I have not tried the other Tae-bo tapes but as soon as I master this one, I will."
2,"Hard to follow, newer video is definitely much better",I felt the video did not take the time to teach the routine. Are we to watch Billy Blanks or watch the class in the background. The Tae-Bo video is 100% better than this one. I thought I'd buy it to get different workouts. I regret making the purchase.
2,Waste of Money,Too much acting and not enough working out. Save your money and buy the actual workout.
2,"Based on the other Tae-Bo workouts, I had higher expecations","This workout was underwhelming. I have done the Tae Bo basic workout and was looking for something harder. Blanks spends about half of the time for each routine teaching you how to do it then does one set. On the basic video, he does many sets until it burns. At the end he shows you a few moves to defend yourself, enough to get yourself killed in a fight. I thought the poor reviews I read before buying this video might have been from the company that does the Tae-Bo videos, but after seeing it for myself, I will stick to the more expensive series of his workouts."
3,This video is great for Tae-bo novices/Not sures,"Want to try taebo, but not ready to make the heavy financial investment until you are sure? The Crunch video will work for you. Blanks patiently teaches the basics, and gives the BEGINNER (kickology) and the WORKOUT (Tae-Bo Jams) on ONE tape. For the low price, you can not go wrong. And if you outgrow it, move up to the advanced taebo tapes. I am into fitness in a major way, but I do not shell out a lot of cash until I KNOW I will like it. People are too harsh. This lets you try it in an affordable way. Get exposed to Billy Blanks without going broke!!!"
2,Not like his others,"I LOVE Crunch videos. I have also enjoyed Tae Bo and Boxing videos before because they are a great workout. I hated this one. It was slow moving in the begining and very unbalanced. Once you got to the second part, the people behind him were on auto-pilot without any cuing from Billy. After five minutes of standing there and trying to figure out what was going on, I shut it off and did one of my Crunch videos that would guarantee a good workout. I was glad I rented this from the library instead of wasting money on a disappointing video."
2,An okay workout -- but no magic.,"The Tae-Bo Crunch workout video does not live up to the hype. Both the Kickology workout and the Tae Boxing workout are difficult to follow -- even for experienced video exercisers. Billy Blanks spends more time talking and not enough time leading the class. Although I worked up a sweat, I plan to limit my Tae-Bo workout to once a week -- otherwise it may become frustrating and boring."
1,Dissatisfied customer,I was very dissatisfied with this tape. I purchased this tape because I have heard good things about Billy Blanks and was interested in his series of tapes. I would not recommend this tape. I never seen a workout tape in which the instructor did not do the exercises.
5,Excellent Kickboxing/Boxing Workouts,"There are 2 workouts in this awsome tape, the first half is a workout that has different combos of moves at a steady pace and it teaches you unique punches and kicking combos, you'll break a pretty good sweat after one session of this workout. The second half is a fat blasting amazing fun kickboxing workout that has the same moves and combos from the first workout but this time at a faster pace with much higher intesity. In this workout you'll break a way bigger sweat than you do in the first half, and you'll tone your arms, legs, and stomach and you'll feel the brun after your first workout. This video will help you burn mega calories, lose weight, tone your whole entire body and teach you self defense techniques."
4,Fun and encouraging!,"Although I have not bought too many other work-out tapes, I enjoyed this one. I have tried a few of my mothers and I just find them so boring and I never really cared enough to do the moves. I could offer many suggestions to make this tape better, but all in all I enjoyed it. I did work up a sweat and I do feel it afterward. I enjoy the whole fighting philosophy. It totally relieved some aggression and I eagerly waited for the next moves. Brings out your anger and then let's you beat it out on ""someone"" without anyone getting hurt."
1,Stick to Tae Bo at the Gym!,"I bought this tape because I had heard so much about Tae Bo. I tried the tape, then did a 1 hour tae bo workout at my club. What a difference! The Club workout was more intense (25 minutes is not nearly enough) was better choreographed and the instructor's instructions could actually be understood.This video is hard to follow. It is difficult to figure out what he wants you to do, and the camera shots don't help. Half the time, the camera is not even on Billy when he is explaining what to do, it is on someone in the class. There is virtually no warm up, not nearly enough stretching. Be sure to stretch on your own first.I bought this because I thought the 2 video pack was a bit pricey. What a mistake. Now I plan to buy the ""real"" video set soon."
1,Nothing to write home about,"I have Billy's Tae Bo tapes and absolutely LOVE them, but this one leaves alot to be desired! I thought this would be a different form of workout (cuz it was supposedly made in 1999) to kinda spice things up a little, but you could tell there must've been a huge mirror on the other side of the camera cuz the women couldn't stop looking at themselves and making what they thought to be sexy poses in the camera that they even would loose their place in the ""workout""! They looked like they just got out of the hair salon with enough makeup on Tammy Faye would be embarrassed. The REAL tae bo workout tapes with those people on them, are TRULY working out and not afraid of getting sweaty. The techniques were good in this one, if you can get past the egos and silliness. Also, what was up with the dancing??"
1,get the real tae bo series,While this might be a different workout and all.. this is DEFINATELY a far cry from the real tae bo workout...Even Billy Blanks himself said on his tae bo website website not to buy this tape. the other tae bo tape is much better. sure its more expensive...but its more worth the money than this little 10 buck tape...
1,Dissapointing,"The only person in this video who knew the routine was Billy. Everyone else fumbled along. And by the time you figured out his move, he'd change and go to the next one. Then there was the couple of gals who not only didn't know what they were doing, I think they were actually flirting with the camera men. This video was a complete waste of time. Try the Crunch Abs and Arms for a better workout."
1,"Buy for a laugh, not for a workout...","This video has the worst coordination I've ever seen! Althoughthis music was better than his Tae Bo videos, it was apparent thatthis was one of his first videos and it was not edited properly. It was more comical than physically beneficial.I am a big Tae Bo fan and found this video highly disappointing. It is hard to follow (even if you rewind and go back - who the heck wants to do that when you're trying to sweat?) because he explains some moves and not others. Not to mention the fact that he gets you all revved up and then stops at 4 reps of an exercise. The video is shot from bizarre angles that make it difficult to tell what the heck is going on, and he moves way too fast. I have been doing Tae Bo for a long time and was not able to follow this video - it is not among his best work.If you want a good laugh, see this video...but don't buy it or rent it to use as exercise!"
3,not so bad,"i bought this tape because it was listed as being 45 mintues long. little did i know that the first workout was a lame though somewhat helpful technical section. i wanted something long and intense. despite the shortcomings of the second workout, i found it interesting and challenging enough that i will buy billy blanks' tae bo videos. note: every crunch video that i have ever used (except for ""the joy of yoga"") has been rather confusing at first, though effective with practice. i don't think that this video is so much a reflection on billy blanks as it is on crunch's inability to truly produce a workout video for ""people from all walks of life."""
2,not safe,"Many of the warm-up moves,eg.(Fast Head Rolls and arm circles) are not physicaly safe for the average participant. During the cardio workout and the floor workout, I believe the video should have been previewed by a physiotherapist,and or a professor in Kineseology or by anyone in the professional fitness industry.Safety should come first, and some of the movements are done too fast for the average or even fit participant to execute properly without prolonged injuries."
3,OK but the editing was very choppy,I got my heartrate up but it just seemed like the workout was not well-structured. It was very hard to follow.
4,Great starter tape,"I just bought this Tae Boxing tape to get a feel for the Tae-bow before I invest in it. This one is obviously made from the TV classes, and is a great intro into getting the moves down. The frist class takes time to work out the moves and put them into combinations. For once I wasnt tripping all over myself because I didnt know the moves. The second class picks up the speed power energy and enthusiasm. I think my money was well spent. I enjoy the work out and I can't ask for more then that and now I know I can work up to Blanks other workouts."
1,Terrible,"I totally agree with others who gave this video a poor review. One person mentioned that by the second part the background people were on ""auto pilot"", without any introduction of what the heck we were doing. It was hard to keep up and Billy didn't really seem to know the correct and reasonable time in the music to start the reps, so a couple times it was off the beat which got annoying. It was sort of bizarre how right after the warm up the people on the video were sweating like pigs, and I wasnt even winded yet. When he DOES decide to explain the moves, he spends so much time doing them slowly and then only does it like once fast. He seemed to like to show off too, all his fancy kicks and such, and I can't get through the beginning without cracking up, where the camera goes down the people in the line, and ends on him with that robe thing on and he says in this serious voice all the stuff about ""kickology"" and stuff. Its a bad video, dont buy it."
1,save your money,"This video is very poorly produced. It is not a good workout for even the intermediate exerciser. Many times Billy is just standing there and you have to try to figure out what the rest of the group is doing. There is not enough repetitions of any set of exercises to make it truly effective. There is not good cueing...which I'm sure you'd get used to after viewing it several times, but it's just not worth it. Even my 10 year old was disappointed!"
2,Difficult to Follow,"While I enjoy Tae Bo videos from Billy Blanks, this one is not only difficult to follow, but very choppy. Billy doesn't lead the class; he throws the viewer off because the class is doing a workout without any direction as to how many reps they're doing or what's next, all the while, Billy is talking. Add to it poor filming (I'd rather see technique rather than how cute someone is) and you've got a workout video not designed for the less graceful or coordinated. Still, Billy Blanks knows his Tae Bo and the last part of the video is a good workout."
1,The worst Tae-Bo video I've seen,"In this video, Billy Blanks spends more time performing for the viewers than leading a good workout. He does not do even repetitions for both sides and relys on his background exercises to lead the workout. Most of the time, he does not cue as to what's coming next. If you do not the difference between a jab and an upper cut, this video is not for you. His Tae-Bo videos are far more effective and instructional than this one."
2,Not so hot.,"I rented this video because I wanted to get a peek before I purchased. What a disappointment. Blanks didn't even bother to do the exercises most of the time. He did one or two reps, and then just watched the others. It was boring too. I don't see how you can expect for people at home to get into the workout, when the guy leading the thing doesn't. Glad I didn't buy this one!"
1,"Terrible, really bad","I bought this video because I thought it was going to be good, but I was so wrong. Like many other disappointed customers, I too agreed with them about the video. The steps are so short and you don't get to review it very much. All the steps are not done in just one directions, but to the sides also. But the camera doesn't focus on any of the step, it focus the people instead of the steps. I would be nice is the camera stayed on one person to actually see how all the steps are done. When it does, it only shows one part of the movements.When I first put the video in, it was like joining the class in the middle because there really wasn't any teaching. Billy doesn't really show you how it should properly be done. You just watch and try to follow the steps even though you could be doing it all wrong. This video wasn't worth it at all. I didn't even break a sweat and I think you have to do atleast 2 or 3 hours of it before you can feel anything."
1,This is Not Part of the TAE BO series,"I got roped into buying this tape after feeling great doing the Tae Bo basic video. It's not the same production company and I'm certain the outdated footage is an embarrassment to Billy Blanks. He probably waived his rights and some hucksters trying to catch some $$$ cash jumped on the Tae Bo bandwagon and spliced this garbage together. DON'T BUY IT, GET THE ADVANCED TAE BO TAPE FROM THE REAL SERIES. You'll be happy you did."
1,IF YOU EXPECT BILLY BLANKS REAL TAE-BO...DON'T BUY THIS TAPE,"The Crunch people were really trying to make money from the Tae-Bo craze. This video was a disappointment. It looked as if they took clips from their ESPN show and threw it together on a video. You will not break a sweat and it was obviously taped to be a demonstration of what the exercise is like. I was surprised at how bad this video was. I own several Crunch tapes and they are all great. Crunch should have taken the time and money to put together a real Tae-Bo tape, instead of marketing this one with the Billy Blanks one. Save your money and buy the real thing."
1,The Video is horrible!!!,"I thought this video, was terrible!!! The only people getting a workout, are those in spandex behind Billy Blanks. Blanks spends the whole time talking, there are so few repeitons that by the time you figured out the step they have moved on to eight other things. Blanks also doesn't show you or describe what to do. the folks in the background conduct the whole exercise, but do not inform the viewer when the moves are changing. Do not buy this, stick with Billy's Tae Bo set."
2,Don't get caught up in the craze!!,When I bought this video I was hoping for a fast-paced workout to get me in top physical shape. I was extremely disappionted that I had to do the workout THREE times to break a sweat!! Don't expect too much from this video if you want to catch the Tae-Bo bug. It doesn't deliver!!
1,More of a comedy than workout,"I bought the Tae-bo series and after LOVING the Basic workout, wanted a tape to complement it. I have been so impressed with Billy Blanks that I almost could not believe I was watching him on the Crunch tape. His Tae-bo series focuses on controlled movements, but this Crunch tape focuses on the women in the background. I couldn't concentrate on the workout because I was laughing too hard at the moves these women were doing! They were trying to make it some kind of dance, which it is not. Definately not worth the time or money."
3,this was my 1st kickboxing video......,"And I have to say that I personally thought it was awesome. I mean, true, Billy did seem a little vain by not even performing the already pre-rehearsed moves himself, but for this to be my first kickboxing tape, i enjoyed it. I am sure it will get extremely boring to me in a few weeks, in which I will advance to a harder tae video. But for ones who are just starting out, I think they may find it an interesting alternative, or addition to aerobics and step workouts. Kicking and boxing moves with the all too popular ""aeeeya!"" karate yell allows me to release some stress, too."
4,Great workout!,I just bought this video yesterday and couldn't wait to try it. I was NOT disappointed at all. I wanted to try out the Tae Bo workouts without making the big investment into the whole set. I thought it was a high-energy workout that keeps you motivated. I can't wait to go home and do it again!
1,TERRIBLE,dont buy!!!!! will rip even if you are careful- impossible to use- too cheap- spend money wiser bc you will wind up having to tape it or just buying another one- the vinly sucks the other material is made out of like paper machei and is better not good- just not as bad as this!
3,Swedish filth rock,"Sweden's Brainbombs dredge up another plate full of sludge on their latest effort. A sound like Motorhead, fellow Swedes the Hellacopters, and the messed up horns of the Cows, all topped off with a bit of the Fall. Their swedish accents make it almost humorous in a Spinal Tap kind of way. The subject matter of their songs is disturbing and demented to say the least, but they do rock. And you have to wonder if they really know what the hell they are singing about! I haven't heard their previous work, so I can't tell if this is an improvement."
2,It lasted a day.,"Within a day of use it broke. My dog bit it once (he bites all of his leashes but not hard, and they usually last a few months) and it broke. I has hopping for something more sturdy. If you have a very small dog, or one that won't bite it even once I guess it would be fine."
2,cotton web lead,"must rate this a 3 out of 10. It is very narrow, less than quoted. Webbing seems to be fairly loose and light weight. The one good thing about it is the clip is heavy and solid."
2,Not Strong Enough,"This leash either had a defect I failed to notice or it is simply not strong enough. The narrow 5/8th inch cotton web leash has begun to tear apart in a spot about two feet from the end clip. My dog is a 60 pound lab and quite energetic when not heeling. When I give him the ""go on"" command he tugs away like crazy and is proving too much for this leash. I'd prefer a 1 inch width but haven't been able to find it in a 20 foot length."
3,Training lead,This product is of good quality only wish it was a bit thicker works great other than that the clip is solid and closes correctly tight and secure the light weight makes it easy to carry
4,nice buy,"Nice weight to the leash with strong, heavy-weight stitching. Well made clatch. Promptly delivered. Overall it was worth the price. Nice buy."
5,Good for the price,"I prefer cotton because it's more comfortable for my hand (I've been seriously rope-burned by a nylon lead). This one is as good as any and a decent price. If you have a very large or strong dog, however, the snap may not be sturdy enough since a dog moving fast at the end of a long lead has a lot of leverage."
4,Good leash for ADD dog,Energetic dog that needed more than the typical short leash to let him have some freedom on his walks - so we tried the adjustable ones but he kept breaking/jamming them. This long leash gets a little tangled up in bushes and underbrush once in a while but it gives him freedom to run around and expend his energy and as long as I can get within 20 ft of him I can get hold of the leash when he runs off on one of his squirrel chases - everyone's a winner!
1,Boring,The author repeats himself on and on.. What he has to say can be said in less than half the space he uses.
3,"Not much ventured, not much gained.","Despite being a very short sketch of SE Asian history, the book seems padded with endless cautionary asides presumably directed at the professional historical establishment apologizing for venturing any assertions about anything. The book could have been shortened by half without missing a thing. Still worth reading, however, for no other reason than everyone else has read it."
3,Too cautious,"The author seems to have a fear of asserting any strong views at all. He should have inserted a general one page disclaimer at the start of the book, along the lines of the following: many of the opinions I express in this book might be challenged by others with more detailed knowledge of specific areas, but in the hope of making the book more interesting (and a lot shorter!) please understand that I have expressed my personal views throughout, without regard to whether each view can be 100% backed up with non-controvertible evidence."
3,"Limited Edition? Yeah, right.","This is Anchor Bay we're talking about. Every last one of their ""limited edition"" DVDs have been re-released. Don't believe me? Hellbound: Hellraiser II, Army of Darkness: The Director's Cut and the television version of Halloween were all once available only in ""limited edition"" 2-disc sets. But once the initial supply ran out, single disc editions were released. Trust me, House 2 will get its own release sometime next year. Not that it matters; it's awful!Anyway, the picture and sound are great on both (even though it's mono), and the extra features are okay. My biggest complaint is the commentary track on the original film. These are the guys that wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the movie, and they know less about it than I do! They keep referring to Roger Cobb's grandma. It was his aunt, (...)!"
1,Sorely Lacking Intelligence.,"Viewed: 12/10Rate: 212/10: House was one of my fondest memories when I had HBO back then as I saw a lot of movies on it. I couldn't remember for a long time what the movie was like until I saw it now. And I do think and remember that the sequel was so much better and funnier while the original was pretty boring to sit through. What I remember the most was the soldier from the dead in the last twenty minutes. He was the most memorable part of the film. The acting by the cast was fair, but I felt the intelligence of the film to be abysmally low. Then again, what do I expect from Steve Miner and Sean Cunningham, the originators of Friday the 13th series? All in all, I just can't believe House got green-lit in the first place. What were they thinking these days?"
2,not what I ordered,I have no problem with the movie I ordered. I have a problem with the type. I ordered a DVD and received a VHS. I tried to cancel before it was shipped when they sent confirmation but to no avail. I didn't want a VHS.
1,This movie was terrible!,"When I subjected myself to watching this movie, I had seven friends with me. By the end of the movie, there were two of us left. The flashbacks were awful, the effects were wretched, and the acting? How good can a movie starring Norm from Cheers and Bull from Night Court actually be? If you voluntarily watch this movie, you are either: a)a stupid college student like me or b)really, really, desperate for any form of entertainment."
2,BAD HORROR,"The beginning is like forever..Once the movie gets started, it's pretty weird. I don't highly recommend it, but it's not bad for horror movie lovers.You know Bull from Night Court??? He's in it.:D"
4,Interview with 'House' writer Ethan Wiley,"I run a movie nostalgia site called 'Natsukashi,' in which we take a film that we have seen in our youth and have not viewed since, rewatch it through the eyes of an adult and then podcast the results. One contributor selected 'House,' and we were fortunate enough to be joined by 'House' writer and 'House 2' director Ethan Wiley for the podcast.He was very open, fun and had a lot to say about both films, as well as many interesting nuggets of information about his earlier industry work at ILM (George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic), and Joe Dante's 'Gremlins.'The entire interview I kept thinking that it would make a great DVD commentary, so if you wish to hear it, here's the link: http://natsukashi.wordpress.com/2009/01/06/episode-xxxv-house-with-its-writer-ethan-wiley/).Enjoy!"
5,I don't care what anybody says!,This movie is not the best i ever saw. But why are these people giving it 1 star. It's awesome. Check it out it has really good special effects.
3,House with a past,"Most people know the star, William Katt, as the star of 80s TV show, Greatest American Hero. Here, he takes a slightly different role about a Vietnam veteran with a troubled past. His character loses a friend in Vietnam & his son dissappears mysteriously which everntually leads to the breakup of his marriage. William Katt's character inherits an old (haunted) house when a late aunt dies & wills it to him. Mysterious things start to happen after that. House is a bit horror, a bit comedy with some good makeup and special effects thrown it. I think this was an entertaining horror film with George Wendt (of TV's Cheers) and Richard Mol (of TV's Night Court) as part of the supporting cast. This movie was a lot of fun. Check it out, you may like it."
4,*A Good Movie*,This a a pretty good movie.Not gory.Its nice just to have a good movie with a little bit of comedy too.I would recommend this movie.
2,Strangely familiar...,"If you enjoy(ed) (and have read ALL of) the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew mysteries, then this book might be for you. This is due to the fact that it ""borrows"" so relentlessly from those sources.In answer to the question posed by another reviewer, the reason that Disney does not ""snap this book up"" is that they'd already optioned ""The Moon Spinners"" (Mary Stewart) back in the 1960s and made it into a first rate adventure starring Hayley Mills.My advice is to stick to the original teenaged sleuths and read then rent ""The Moon Spinners""."
5,"""That's a nice thought."" ""It isn't mine.""","There are really no words I can write to do this one justice. It's one of the single most moving experiences I've ever had reading anything, never mind comic books. McKean's line art is breathtaking, and the painted interludes and photo montages are every bit as fascinating, disturbing, and touching as anything he's done with Neil Gaiman or Grant Morrison. The story is about a tenement and its various occupants, but it's also about inspiration and love, and the things that drive us to create. Go read it."
5,hey!,"Why is this out of print! Deep stink of bad! It should be in print always, there should be 5000 more of these made every day! Do something! Print this very good thing!"
2,Disappointed,"The idea of this book is interesting, but its extremely long drawn, and the monologues uninteresting.McKean is a great artist, but he does not really excite me as a story teller. I found myself hoping for some sections to be over as quickly as possible.I think he plays with some cliches but is not very successful at it. The book lacks meaningful connections (implicit or explicit) in between the stories, and ""truths"" we can relate to.This is not a book by him I would recommend."
4,Good.,"This product is good, I just got it, my first time using it, when i rinsed out the shampoo my hair felt a little dry, but very very. Thje conditoner adds the moisture back into you hair. Leaving soft & tangle free, with a great scent. I just used it today, but I will update when I have used the whole bottle, & in that review I will leave the result, whether or whether not this product produces hair growth."
2,Didn't really work for me,"This product lasted me two months. However, I didn't notice any changes in my hair. My hair length was still the same. I guess it doesn't work for everyone."
3,Very soft hair and good growth,"This shampoo and conditioner is amazing because my hair is so much manageable after i use it. The shampoo is not hard on your hair and the conditioner makes your hair feel soo soft. I tried many conditioners but they were never as good as this one. . as for growth: i've been using this for 3 weeks and my boyfriend asked me one day ""is your hair getting longer???"" it really did look long that day. . i dont know if its from the shampoo or if its from how i styled it that day. however, my hair does seem longer so i will continue to use this product. im also taking vitamin pills. all this is really worth the money. good hair makes you feel good."
2,Balls of hair in the shower!!!,"I ordered this product to give it a try, even there's a lot of bad reviews on the website. I didn't care because I know some people will exaggerate on the bad reviews. All products will works depends on the health conditions, food and other stuff. All I can say I tried for 1 months and I couldn't use it anymore. Hair loss was too much, price was little expensive... The only reason Im giving 2 stars it was because the CLEAN smell, no more than that, but like I said it didn't work for me, maybe, other people will said IT WORKS."
3,It was okay,"this stuff honestly is not worth the money.I used it til it was gone and my hair grew maybe an inch.Yes, it did make my hair stronger and i felt a difference HOWEVER if you are buying this product for hair growth, don't bother.I'm going to try Nioxin instead because I heard that stuff works very very well.I would also recommend vitamins!! I'm taking ultra mega hair and skin vitamins from GNC and I've already noticed my nails and hair are both longer!!"
2,Um. No.,"I bought this and used it every. single.day. It smells funny and I think it gave me more split ends than I had before, so I doubt it made my hair grow. Keep shopping, ladies."
4,Great so far!.....(:,"Okay so i just bought f.a.s.t. the other day and i got it in the mail so fast! i was so excited to use this because i used to have pretty long hair, but it was split from all the dying so i went to get it cut. i told the girl at the salon 1 inch and she cut off 3 INCHES! :( i was soo sad and determined to grow it back. my hair takes a while to start growing but when it does, it grows fast so i was hoping this would make it even faster. I just used it for the first time today and my hair is SOOO soft ! even if my hair doesnt grow faster im glad i got it because my hair feels amazing:)) ill be updating in a month or 2 to see the progress. i would recommend this product for sure! :) hopefully it keeps working, wish me luck!"
2,didn'twork!,"i recieved this product over a month ago, and my hair has not grown any faster then before, i have already used a whole bottle of both the shampoo and conditioner, no results!!"
2,regular shampoo,There is nothing special about this product it is just regular shampoo and it made my scalp dry my hair didn't even grow
3,FAST Shampoo/Conditioner.... Doesn't really work.,"I bought this at a local salon and the stylists insisted it would work. In the past month my hair has grown A LITTLE, but who's to say it's from the shampoo or conditioner. Plus I've never really had stubborn hair to begin with. I think it smells great, and although the shampoo knots my hair up, the conditioner is AWESOME!!! My hair didn't fall out or dry, but it does rip chemical hair color right out. So I guess if you have a bad home dye job this is a good set."
4,Over All I can definatly say it worked for me ! ^_^,Be aware that this productts might work differently for everyone ! Well to start off I used this product for a month and it was the 12oz bottles me and my sister used it so that's why it finished faster but it did do what the product is ment to do my hair grew about an inch being that it was bearly touching my coller bone to now being past it. It's overall a good product I would definitely try it again I used it to review it first an loved it! :D alot of people said they had dryness in there hair even after using the conditioner I personally would leave it in for 3 minutes instead of 1 minute and it left it really soft. An I would also use a leave in conditioner for extra moisture : ) it lathered pretty well and worked good the only thing I didn't like was that I had to wash my hair with hot water that's why I'm giving it a 4 stars but overall it was great ! The only way you'll see if it works is by trying it out !
5,Love it!,"I'm trying to grow a pixie out and am grabbing at straws to make it easier on me. I bought this shampoo and I was a little hesitant because of the price, but I have to say I will continue to buy it until I reach my length goal. It smells good, not a strong smell but a faint clean smell. Makes my hair feel thicker ( I have very fine hair). And I have noticed quicker growth than I normally would if I hadn't used the product. Overall it's put my hair in better shape. Makes it feel really healthy and clean."
4,"Too soon for results, but...","I have only used this shampoo and conditioner about 5 times, so it is too soon to see results. However, it leaves my hair silky and healthy looking after each use and the conditioner is light enough to not weigh down my fine hair. The smell is...different...but overall it is a good product!"
1,Please Read Before Buying.,"I wish I would have read the negative reviews before trying this product. Yes it has made my hair grow faster, I can tell by my roots. HOWEVER, its not worth the negatives. I noticed that my hair was coming out in large amounts in the shower. I first assume it was because I hadnt brushed my hair so it had built up, but after several times of large amounts of hair loss I'm worried that this will not grow back. I wish I never tried this product because I'm scared to lose my hair!!!"
5,F.A.S.T. Nisim FAST Shampoo & Condiitioner For FAST Hair,Excellent product. Product works. A little challenging when one has color on their hair. Your color will fade a little. But this product is Great overall. I would recommend it! Hair growth excellent. It is important t use both the Shampoo and Conditioner together for best results.
3,Satisfied,"I've used this for about three months, the 1st month i didn't notice too much of a difference but the last 2 months my hair has gotten about 3 inches. I'm planning to stick with it for a whileTIPS- I cut off all my dead ends (find a stylist you can trust not to hack off all your hair)- I drink tons of water! My hair loves it- I rarely use heat on my hair and when I do, I use a heat defence product.- I deep condition my hair once a week (aussie 3 min miricle left on for about an hour)- I only wash my hair every other day. The natural oils are really good for your hair. Just make sure that you brush your hair more often on these days, than regular, so the oils and get to your ends.Getting long, healthy hair takes time and patience for people like me who's hair just wont grow at all!! But stick with the product. Dont give up on it right away. And good luck!!!"
1,Garbage,"Title says it all, but to explain it breifly; its cheap shampoo that was put in a bottle that claims to help you grow or keep hair that you have. I have tryed other products that have simaler claims that retail for more, its worth the extra expence because this stuff will dry your scalp, give you dangruff , make you pull your hair out! arnt they saposed to text this stuff on animals first!"
4,Pretty Decent Product,"Ive used F.A.S.T for about a little less than a month. I followed the directions exactly; shampooing twice, hot water, etc. I felt like my hair was growing faster, but was sure I was making it up until my boyfriends daughter (age 4) said it had. And my boyfriend agreed you could tell.The reason I gave it 4 stars was because, it made my hair texture feel weird. It was shiney and soft, but made it have a wierd texture.Overall I would suggest it, but I took hair and nail vitamens with it.Also I would suggest that you use a treatment with it."
1,Nothing happened!!,"I purchased this product about three months ago and I didn't notice anything different about my hair. I was really hoping to see maybe a quarter of an inch or half an inch of growth, atleast just to say, it worked, but no, very disappointed. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Does work,"I don't know what I was thinking, thinking there was a product that would make your hair grow faster. I don't know if you have to use a product like this for a certain amount of time before noticing a result but I used for 2 months and noticed nothing. Maybe it's just me and my hair grows slower then most, but I was looking forward to this product but i didn't get the results. ) :"
2,=(,Didn't really work but it smells kinda good?I don't know maybe its just my hair.I'm Vietnamese with wavy thick hair so yeah.
2,Lots of hair loss,"For the price - I expected a pretty decent combo! Totally disappointed. The shampoo made my hair incredibly tangled. It felt nasty after rinsing. Also, I noticed A TON of hair loss with this product. Literally 4-5 times more than usual. People may say, ""Oh you're loosing hair because you are getting new growth"" -- yeah, no thanks! I don't want all my long hair clumping out for a few new short strands. Overall - never again. I didn't even finish the bottles. Waste!Namaste"
2,-------Note for women of color-------,"I recently transitioned from permed to ""natural hair. And being a woman of color I wanted to find products to maximize my natural hair growth. Seeing the online reviews for FAST, I decided to give it a try. I hate that I wasted my money. The product did ship on time, however, You must wash your hair with this product every day :( Then on top of that, the shampoo dried my hair out and made it feel hard and brittle. The conditioner made it a little softer, but it basically matted my hair and made it very tangled and difficult to manage. I had high hopes but was let down.... the only positive thing is that it has a pretty nice smell...lol I didnt even get through half the bottle!!!!"
2,not worth the money,its just an ordinary shampoo and coditioner and doesnt help the hair grow any faster.you can go buy any shapoo and get same results-nothing.
4,F.A.S.T Review!,I bought this because I wanted longer hair in faster time. I think it works really well! My hair has been getting longer. I will definitely be purchasing it again!
2,Did not work for me...,"It's an alright shampoo and conditioner set. But I've been using it for months, and have seen no faster hair growth.If anything, my hair has actually been growing slower.I have heard this works for some people, I'm not sure why or why not.But if it does not help grow my hair, then I'd much rather use a different shampoo set.Best of luck!"
1,Very Sad,"I was really excited to try this product, after many years of looking for things to help with my hair growth. I first bought it because all of the wonderful reviews, i went through two bottles thinking that it needed more time and to be honest i feel like my hair hasnt grown at all, if anything I feel like I'm losing some hair now that im on my second bottle. This product doesnt work for everyone I guess. Good luck people."
5,This is REAL!!!!,"Who ever buy's this product, it works. My hair has grown about 5 inches in about 3 months. I kid you not... try it and you will see what I mean... Very pleased with FAST!!!"
4,it worked,I only used for a week while I was waiting for Surface Awaken system- I did notice growth the only disappointment in that short time period was that it seemed to dry my hair. I will use again probably in between the expensive Surface awaken reorders. The FAST is much more affordable-- but I like the Surface better-- it left my hair soft and also seemed to work-- my co-workers were able to tell a difference when they had not seen me for a week.
3,"Makes hair healthy, doesnt really grow.","I like this product, it makes my hair look so healthy and soft and shiny. The only downfall is that i'm losing alot of hair and i havent seen any growth and ive beeing using it for about a month."
3,"No proof yet, but it will take a year to see results.","Maybe this product works but it's hard to tell. It does double your hair growth which is great, but hair grows so slowly in the first place that it will take a long time to tell the difference."
5,really works!!,"I had cut my hair very, very short and I hated it. I ordered this product not really expecting much, but I was greatly surprized! My hair has grown out very quickly. So happy!"
2,OK shampoo and conditioner but no growth,"After a bleaching mishap, I lost quite a bit of hair that broke off about 1"" from my roots so needless to say I was in dire need of fast growth. I had already been taking biotin before this so I continued to do that and used this shampoo and conditioner every time I washed my hair for a full month. Being that I dye my hair, it is easy to see the growth line at the root. I don't even think my hair grew the 1/2"" that is ""average"" to most people. Looks to me more like 1/4"" based on the line I see. Very disappointed. The shampoo and conditioner are ok and I will continue to use it up but I can't say it helped with hair growth in any way. For the price, I'd prefer to use other brands. I see it works for some. I guess I will keep taking my biotin and hoping for the best."
4,yaaayyy,"So far so good. I recieved this product on January 7th, started using it the same day. today is Jaunary 23, and my hair has grown at least 3/4 of an inch. im gunna say about an inch a month, thats my goal by january 28-30 th ! ((:definately work though, im probably going to be buying another bottle soon. and i keep updating!i saw reviews that it makes the hair nasty feeling and dry? heck no, not at all. its soft and smooth and shiny and looks very healthy! im so glad. (:"
4,Great stuff!,"I used to have waist length, super thick, straight blonde hair. For some dumb reason I decided to cut it into this very short hair style where the back was buzzed and the front was about chin-length. I let it grow for some time naturally and it just wasn't growing at the same rate it used to. After I started using this stuff my hair has grown 2 inches since the week before new years. I measured it by my ""dye line"". I dyed it a lighter color a few days before I started using FAST so I can see the darker hair thats grown in so far. The downside is that it is VERY drying. I use a L'oreal hair mask every time I wash it to keep my scalp from aching. I love my results so far, hopefully it keeps up in the future!"
1,DONT BUY!,"used the shampoo and conditioner for about a month. made hair grow, but made it thinner,break easily, and fall out like crazy. i dye my hair blonde and after using it one day i ran my hand through my hair and squeezed out water and the water was yellow."
4,Still evaluating...,"Have been using this product for about one month now. However, have also started taking hair, skin and nail type vitamins. At this time, I cannot determine which is contributing to hair growth. I can say that my hair is certainly healthier and appears to be stronger than before. Started my kids on the product so I can see if it actually helps."
5,Amazing Results,"I bought this product not sure of how well it would work but I got a horrendous haircut and was desperate for my hair to grow as fast as possible. I used this for about three weeks and when I started I wouldn't even wear my hair down let alone let it naturally air dry and be fine (I hated how poufy and short it looked) but then I used this and it grew so fast and now it's almost back to it's original length. I swear it grew at least two inches in three weeks at least. This product is magic i dont know how it works but it does - i barely used other conditioners with it and had no negative side effects. Wouldn't say my hair felt softer but it stayed normal, smelled good and grew fast. When I did use aussie 3 minute repair conditioner however the results were even better. This product is a godsend and I just ordered more to keep it growing. DEFINITELY recommend!!"
1,this product is a waste of money!,this hair product has a bad smell to it and it also does not work! it dryed out my hair! i will never use it again! i really think that whats in the bottle is not whats on the label! it made my hair worse not better like i thought it would! i think this is a fake hair product!
3,Longer hair for a price,"I got a bad hair cut and ordered this to grow my hair back asap. I used it for almost exactly two months. I did notice that my hair grew, but so much of my hair fell out while washing it that it made me regret using the shampoo. Oh well, I guess I'll try Biotin now to get my hair to grow back."
2,DID NOT WORK,"I am not claiming that this product did not work or does not work for some, but after two months of consistent use (I did not use any other hair shampoos or conditioners) I did not see any change in my hair growth that I would attribute to this product. Unfortunately I think that when it comes to accelerated hair growth, it just has to happen to old fashion way- a lot of time and maybe some vitamins. If you choose to use this product any way, the smell is somewhat pleasant but it may leave your hair a bit dry at times."
3,Seen some growth but...,"It's been about a month that I've been using this shampoo and conditioner and I think I've seen some growth in my hair. However, the very first thing I noticed the first time I used it was that my hair started falling out more. I'm not sure why. I used Pantene Pro V before this product and my hair wouldn't fall out as much. Now, I'm constantly gathering fallen strands of hair in the shower. I doubt I'll be ordering more of this product after it's finished. The hair growth is nice, but not for the price of my hair falling out."
2,eh.,I haven't seen much of a difference in hair growth..I had better luck with mane n tail. It smells good though!
5,AMAZING product.. Strongly recommended!,"I was initially skeptical about this product actually working as well as I have read it does. I got a perm two years ago and it left my hair VERY damaged and dry and nothing I did, from deep conditioners and repairing shampoos and conditioners, nothing seemed to work. Eventually, I decided to give FAST a shot and I LOVE IT. It makes my hair so soft, so shiny and healthy looking, and extremely beautiful. I have never come across a product that I love this much. I am NOT an employee of Nisim, just a very satisfied customer. The only complaint I have is that the shampoo leaves your hair a little bit dry feeling at first, so the conditioner is a must-have. But it smells nice (just a very clean smell) and it works great. I kid you not, I get compliments EVERY day now on how pretty my hair is and how soft it is. BUT IT!"
2,She goes too fast!,"I felt this workout in my arms. But, she does the movements too fast!! Initially, she does them slowly, but then she speeds up--I was concerned about doing the exercises improperly. This is the same reason I hate TaeBo."
3,hmmm,"this vinyl matt. protector, is poorly made, and in a few months it will start to deteriate(fall apart)."
5,Two year old safe,"I love this product, it's very handy with a two year old learning to potty train, and she can't take it off of her bed!"
1,Pretty dreadful,"Ripped in several places while I was putting it on. Surface became dry and brittle over time, eventually puncturing in several places on top as well. All in all a terrible purchase, not one I'll be making again."
1,The mattress protector lasted five seconds,"The moment I started to pull the mattress protector on my bed, it ripped. There are now two rips in it. Very cheap material."
1,Not very durable,"Trying to pull this on our mattress, it split up the seams. It pretty much shredded everywhere as we tried to pull it on. Don't purchase unless the mattress is very thin, or it won't fit."
1,Retrospect wants you to buy expensive support and for what?,"I use to swear by retrospect and it never let me down until OS X. Since Dantz started to support OS X its been ""You can purchase Retrospect Support, for $xxx a year...."" and how good is this support? Not very I have a very common DVDR Drive that they still don't support, I wouldn't complain if I owned the express back up, but I own the Pro package and the support is lousy! so many $$$ a call to find out that I need to update to their new software after I had just purchased an upgrade and then they still can't say they know if they support a Pioneer A107 DVDR!? $150 plus a year for support I don't think so..."
3,Powerful but hard to use,"This program is powerful and versatile, but it's difficult to use, especially if you use different media (hard disk, zip disks, DVDs, etc.). They also call things that we were already familiar with, like disk sets and incremental backups, differently. The printed manual is nice, though.To the guy from Pa. who couldn't use the DVD writer: next time get a better namebrand. Retrospect works great with the built-in Toshiba DVD burner in my laptop."
2,Requires Extra Cost CD Burning Software,"To create a recovery disk, Retrospect creates a CD image file which must be burned to a CD using another program (the file contains the restore software and a snapshot of the backed up hard drive). When backing up a single large drive, this file easily exceeds the size of a single CD, preventing the use of XP's built in CD burner. The manual said absolutely nothing about this (weak and confusing documentation). Instead, I found the information hidden away in a text file on the Retrospect CD. Because the box and manual said nothing about having to purchase additional software (considering the price of Retrospect, one certainly wouldn't think so), I'm giving this program a low rating. Beyond this, Retrospect appears to be a great program."
1,Good luck,"I have an older version of this. When my wife's computer crashed last week, it took the catalog with it. So now I have a recent back up of her hard drive (or disk as Retrospect calls it) which no version of Dant software seems to recognize so as to rebuild the catalog. I have several versions because I originally bought it, and then it came bundled with each of the three Maxtor one touch drives I have purchased."
2,Poor Hardware Support,"I purchased this product based on a reccommendation from the David Lawrence Radio Show without checking its specific hardware support. As it turned out, no drivers for my newer Samsung CD-RW/DVD combo device are available from Dantz, and the program's ""Custom Configuration"" device was unable to configure/manufacture one that would work.Now I am stuck with having to return the software (if Amazon allows) or 'invest' in a new compatible back up hardware device.Be VERY cautious when buying this product -- wish I had been moreso........."
1,blue screen problems,"Bought this memory for my wife's laptop. At first, it seemed to work fine, but she started getting blue screen failure on a regular basis. Switched back to the old memory and everything was fine again. Can't recommend this memory."
4,Makes it hum along,"Installed very easily, they mislead users somewhat saying it can be upgraded to 2gig. When really it is only one. The onboard counts as one, so the only stick that works is another single, if you buy a two thinking it will work it will not.Specifically for the Lenovo S10, it will not boot with a two gig stick, it will only accept and additional one gig. But, it is entirely worth it."
4,Great first album by Warrant!,"I think that Warrant made a very good debut with this album. It was so over the top in its sound. Although I listen to R&B, rap and urban stuff, this was one of the more unique heavy metal albums that I got to listen to. Heaven and Sometimes She Cries were the power ballads that were hits, but I love the rockers in Down Boys, D.R.F.S.R., 32 Pennies, In The Sticks and the last two. There's a lot of energy and the guitars are revved up on this effort. Jani Lane sings with attitude on here, and the lead guitars in Erik Turner along with bassist Jerry Dixon and the other members provide the backbone for the band. Although Cherry Pie and later albums did well, they are no contest to this debut. It's good to hear that the remaining members still perform today and still wowing audiences!"
3,warrants horny first release (yawn),"well,well,well, it seems warrant is dirty rotten filthy stinking rich. personally i really only like DRFSR and heaven but these songs are really good. i can see the obvious effort in other songs but jeez (huh, i have 32 pennies in a ragu jar, i always preferred prego spaghetti sauce though.)buy this album, just know it dont have as much potential as the other albums."
3,Good Effort from a Second Rate Band,"There are some really good songs on this album that make it worth having, but it far from being the best. Warrant was mainly a one album band; the stuff they made after this was really awful. This one is ok though."
3,"Average, not bad","Well, I've tried listening to this album and I thought it was okay. I didn't like the album's version of ""Heaven"" too much. The lyrics are quite good and Jani is a good singer, but what this lacks is just better music (or maybe the musical intruments need quality improvement). Anyways, I have the album and I prefer the version of ""Heaven"" in the ""1989 Billbord"" as the sound quality was better as well as Jani's vocals (more emotion and more balanced). If you are only buying this for the sake of ""Heaven"", I'd suggest getting ""1989 Billboard"". If you are just a plain Warrant fan, take it with you."
3,"Wrong description, but good scissors","The description of the scissors is, unfortunately, wrong, both here and on the J.A. Henckels website. These 7"" scissors are actually only 7.5"" from tip to the end of the handle instead of the 10.5"" described. Thus, the cutting blades are only 3.25"" long. These are the usual high quality Henckels scissors, but if you are looking for longer cutting blades, try the longer 9 1/2"" model, model 41300-251."
2,"OK, but not what Henckels used to be.",The scissors are just OK. Older Henckels scissors were made much better -- but then they were made in Germany. No doubt these were made in China.
3,Sloppy detailing,"Useful and informative, but Norton was a bit slap-dash in its production. The ""newly-drawn plans"" were disappointing and nowhere near the standard in architectural publishing; whoever was responsible shouldn't have been."
4,Growing Up in One,"Great book and overview of Adler's extensive work. Having grown up in Albert Lasker's Lake Forest estate; Mill Road Farm (p74), I was thrilled to see the arial photo's of the massive estate in it's heyday. One of Adler's most excellent sub-architects Jerome Cerny deserves recognition for his contributions to many of these beautiful houses. Indeed he and his family occupied part of the Mill Road Farm estate while I lived there. Enjoy!"
1,AWFUL--and here's why!,"Unfortunately the Patsy Cline segment is dreadful. Instead of letting her perform, every song is interrupted for people to talk about Patsy. The people who made this program should release it where the commentary remains but her COMPLETE song performances are included."
3,No surprise that the trilogy was not completed.,"Soldier of the mist was a great book, and this was a good sequel, but you can see the problem with writing it. Unless you have a brilliant memory the plot becomes more and more difficult to follow, the memories more difficult to call up, like Latro we are referring to our journal to see what went before, and I think Wolfe, brilliant writer that he is, realised the limitations of this style of writing and decided to abandon number three. Confusing and difficult to read, this book is not a patch on the first!"
4,Probably the best available version,"While not perfect, this is a very good production of Macbeth. Mara Zampieri is an almost perfect Lady Macbeth, although her overdone facial expressions, while understandable in a theatre setting can be somewhat offputting in closeup. Her singing, however, meets the demands of the role quite well. Verdi wanted a singing actress who could express villainy in her voice rather than just a beautiful voice, and Zampieri fills this role well. Renato Bruson is also a very believable Macbeth. James Morris as Banquo is somewhat wooden, but the main, really the only major, drawback is Sinopoli. His conducting is quite good, but he hogs too much of the screen. The camera focusses on him not only in the overture and preludes to the various acts, but also at times when the chorus is singing on stage. While obviously the conductor is important in every opera, it is the action on stage that one wants to see, not the conductor, especially a hyperactive one."
1,Buy another version!,"This is a very boring version of 'Macbeth'. Only Renato Bruson sings really well. Mara Zampieri is a good actress, but her voice wasn't in her best day. Neill Schicoff is really horrible here and James Morris isn't very well too.Ronconi's production is really boring. There aren't anything in scene, only a real chair and some panels.I don't like Sinoppoli very much.In resume, don't spend your money with this, buy another version."
2,Una voz chillona,"En español decimos ""voz chillona"" cuando el timbre es más agudo de lo necesario. Si hubiese recordado que la voz que no me dejaba llegar al final de la Fanciulla del West era la de esta misma cantante, no hubiese adquirido esta versión de Macbeth. Durante todo el tiempo no hago más que pensar cómo hubiese gozado escuchando a María Callas en un papel de tanta fuerza. Haré un esfuerzo nuevamente para degustar los intrigantes agudos de alguien que intriga tras el trono."
3,ECSTASY GIRLS 2 IS WAY BETTER!,"Amazon.com needs to get ecstasy girls2! its way way better then the first one. I know i would buy it if they got it. I keep checking every once in a while because i sent Amazon an email suggesting they get it, but we will see. Anyways, This movies ok, but one of the scenes is in black and white, and they dont have as good models. Also the camera angles are not as good as they are in number 2. and they dont show the ""crotch shots"" as well as they do in number 2. BOTTOM LINE : GET ECSTASY GIRLS 2 NOT THIS ONE"
4,The young mad scientists help the much madder adults,"In this book, Henry and the other young mad scientists help the military locate a nuclear missile that has landed in the local lake. It is the third book in the series. It has a much more complex storyline than any of the the other Mad Scientists stories and makes the guys question the purpose of their endeavours. In an earlier adventure, we are given to believe that the military would be the best place for the young scientists to grow up, but in this story we see that the military has serious flaws. This is radical for a story from this era, especially from an author who was part of the military-industrial complex himself."
5,Quality Boy's Literature,"The Mad Scientists Club series of stories is great for sixth through high school. It uses humor, pranks, andimagination to portray developing minds, and interests them in science, and good works through a knowledgeof science and scouting."
4,Good writer - good read,I have enjoyed all of the Posadas book up until Estelle takes over as sheriff. This was one of the better ones. Havill is a very good writer - wish he would start another series (maybe he has and I haven't found it). Enjoy his writing and character development is slow (sometimes too slow) but I like the way he does it.
2,Not impressed,"We are in the last stages of refurbishing a house with a huge amount of ceramic tile and somewhat tired grout that needs a bit of a facelift. I bought a bottle of this product and tried it out yesterday in one of the bathrooms, diluted to medium strength per instructions. Followed the directions diligently, but after all was said and done, I can see no difference whatsover in the condition of the grout. Back to the drawing board to find a different product."
1,Does not work for white grout,I got this product to clean the grout on our kitchen counters. We have white tile and white grout and it gets pretty cruddy looking with coffee and food stains. We tried this product mixing it according to their directions for heavy stains (1 to 3) and let it 'dwell' on the grout for the prescribed 5 minutes with some brushing as they suggest. The end result was grout that looked about the same as before.We ended up trying bleach on the grout an it works like magic. Let it sit for 2 minutes and then whip it off and the grout comes out clean and white. The smell of bleach is irritating and you have to be careful of your cloths but it is no less harsh then Aqua Mix and best of all it works (which is all we were after in the first place).
2,THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL ALBUM,DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL 'TAKE ME HOME' ALBUM RELEASED IN 1979. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THE CASABLANCA YEARS CD. THIS HAS 'TAKE ME HOME' AND 'PRISONER' IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORMS. THE NEW CD 'OUTRAGEOUS' IS ALSO A REWORKING OF THE 'PRISONER' ALBUM. BOTH OF THESE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELASED IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM WITH THE ORIGINAL ARTWORK.
2,Nice to have...but a complete reissue would've been better.,Be careful guys (and gals)...do yourself a favor and get the Casablanca compilation version which includes The album Prisoner too. This is an edit/mash-up of the original album.
1,take me home,"a travisty to say the least. How can anyone take such a ""classic"" song and butcher it up, and then sell a cd that containes almost no originals songs from the original album. The songs included in this cd are awful. I can only hope that a ""new"" original recording is done. I felt cheated when I bought this cd, hoping to find such great songs as ""wasn't it good"" and ""happy was the day we met"" ""say the word"" all in there full length versions. Even the greatest hits has a cut version of ""take me home"". What is going on here!"
1,NEVER CAME,received notification that book was sent on 1-6-12 would arrive between 1-16- and 1-26 no book ever arrived sent message to international books who did end up refunding my money on 2-1-12 verry disappointed as the book was suppose to be for my daughtters book report will never use them again
3,Purchased as a gift.,"Did not read and therefore cannot give a valid evaluation. The person I purchased the book for enjoyed it and therefore, I cannot really say more."
5,A departure from form but not from excellence.,"This book is a departure from the place/historical type genre that is typical of most of Michener's work. However, it is wonderful. The teen-agers in the book all come from such different worlds yet they seem to meld together for a while before they must to grow up. The insights into the lives of young people and the ramifications of their early decisions make the characters memorable. The character development in this book makes it one of Michener's best. A book that should be required reading in every high school"
2,Looking back from 1999 this book seems unsophisticated.,"This was the first Michener I read and it almost kept me from continuing. The characters are typical stereotypes of 60's and 70's adolescents. Reading in 1999, the plot line seemed obvious and the characters a bore. The adolescent arrogance and assumption that all is new in the 60's was laughable and boring -- and the fact that they are indulged by the adults makes it worse. The illicit drug plotline shows little innovation. Maybe it was innovative when first published prior to the lessons/publications of the late 70s, 80s and 90s. But now it seems to be only an artifact of a forgotten time. It is not timeless but very dependent on the time period it was published within. I'm glad that I read Hawaii or a I would have missed out on an excellent writer."
3,A Good Start But It's All Downhill From Then On!!!,"This book showed a lot of promise in it's early chapters. Mr. Mitchener gives the reader detailed descriptions of his characters and then the book degenerates (literally) into a orgy of drug abuse, sexual promiscuity and the pointlessness and lack of purpose that any of his characters have in their lives.They just seem to drift from one drug high to their next sexual encounter. Plus one has to wonder just who is financing this highly self indulgent lifestyle ? One of the losers depicted in this book has aspirations of participating in the ""Running Of The Bulls"" Festival in Pabloma. Does this guy need to get a life or what? After reading this book one can only come to the sad conclusion that' Youth is indeed wasted on the Young"".I give this book 3 stars because the early Chapters are written very well by this (sometimes) great writer."
2,boring and too much philosophical stuff,"what a bore! yawn! no adventures or cool stories, just a bunch of hippies cruizing around with too much time on their hand. use this book for philosphy 101!"
5,Great help once the pkgs start filling up under the tree,"I love this product! Have two of them, one for the upstairs tree and one for downstairs. It makes it so much easier to turn it on and off, especially once the packages start appearing under the tree and you can't access the plug. Even our grandkids know to step on the ball to turn on the tree!"
2,Only for Christmas lights,"This sounded handy for use in my garage but turns out it is only suited for low voltage Christmas lights. So it does what it says, but don't try to use it for anything else. I probably should have read the fine print."
1,Warning: fire risk and cancer/birth defects risk,"I thought this product was great until I bothered to read the packaging that came with it. The Amazon description does not say this, but on the packaging it states that this extension cord cannot be used for more than 90 days or else there is a fire hazard. Also, you might have missed, as I did, the inconspicuous link on the product page for California residents (presumably because only California has laws protecting consumers from this) that goes to a page that says the product has chemicals that are known to cause cancer and birth defects. It's also worth noting that the manufacturer has discontinued this product. If you're just using this product seasonally for holiday decorations, perhaps you won't mind, but I'd avoid this extension cord, especially if you have kids in the house or are expecting."
4,question re this product,"Do you think this item would be good for a window air conditioner? I have an elderly friend who has difficulty reaching the on off switch (over furniture, etc) for her window unit, so she often goes without a/c when she would benefit from it. What do you think?"
2,Light Duty,"This product has a 5 AMP fuse that will only support 3 strings of (C9) lights. If you are using this for your Christmas Tree and have lights like the picture on the package, this product will not work."
2,Does not light up.,"The model I got doesn't light up, nor is it the one pictured. It's green, yes, but the button is also green, and there are no lights. It still works, so I want to give it a higher rating, but really...false advertising isn't cool either."
5,Great investment & very easy to use.,"Just plug your tree lights into here and BAM! You're ready to rock & roll!I bought this because it's a pain to go under the tree and plug the lights in. Our tree was prickly this year, so I certainly didn't want to get stabbed by one of those sharp needles. This item was very easy for my family and I to use. Just step on the button when you want it on or off. Can't wait to use it next year!"
5,Works,This works very well for the Christmas trees and nativity sets we use christmas light on. We bought 3 more.
3,Great for Elderly,Simple product that can be placed between outlet and lamp (etc) to allow on/off via foot.I have since seen a similar product that has a backlit button making it easier to find in the dark.Overall very satisfied.
5,Wonderfully useful,"We have a few light sources that don't have an on/off switch, but with these you don't have to keep plugging them in and unplugging them, plus our small children can now ""turn on"" those lights."
2,maybe not so good,"The outer package says rated for 13A, 125V 500watts incandescent lamp load.BUT then I opened it and inside found ""CAUTION - Risk of fire. Not for permanent installation. Use only with a total of 5 Amps maximum Christmas tree or other seasonal lighting products. Do not install or use this product for more than a 90 day period per year.""That makes it useless for my intended use. And makes me not trust it!I'm sorry I bought it."
1,Did not Receive the Product Shown/Described,"As with other reviewers, I did not receive the product actually advertised on this page. I purchased from toolboxsupply. The cord does not have the nightlight feature. It has a green button instead of a red. Although I don’t care about the color of the button, this is indicative of this seller blatantly providing something other than what you have actually purchased. Given all that, I can’t trust anything about the cord they sent me. I have no idea if it is a cheap counterfeit and is safe to use. I won’t trust my family’s safety to something with so many questions marks. I will be returning, and expect not to have to pay for the return shipping, either."
3,Tree extension cord,"This cord was what I was looking for which was an easy way to turn on the Christmas tree lights. My only objection was that the cord from the plug to the step-on button was too short. I made it work and will use it again, but you have to be pretty careful with the placement of the tree/item to even use it."
3,Better one out there,I puchased this and it's ok. There is a better one in which the plastic rims lights up.I much prefer that as it is easier to see in the dark.
3,Involving if not surprising,"The thing about a book by Klein is you are either a real fan or you aren't - there really isn't a middle point. Most people who have encountered Klein before would have read `No Logo' and this book is very much in the same vein, with commentary on, or more specifically against, the perceived rise of a capitalist corporatist culture, driven by a consumerist West which is disadvantaging the rest of the world. This book is a collection of articles and speeches by Klein about issues regarding international regimes, the good and bad sides of globalisation, and the resistance movements that seem to now be a prerequisite for any meeting of economic importance. A good non-scholarly take on one facet of the many-sided debate on globalism and its effects."
2,Collection of already published articles,"Naomi Klein is not known for her fine analysis of globalization nor of the neo-liberal social transformations of the last 2 decades. She is known for her understanding of what has been called (unjustly?) the anti-globalization movement and by her predominance in the discourse creation/shaping of this movement. If you want to know about the ideas debated by the constellation of activists fighting neo-liberal globalization, this is your book... however, you'll have to accept the usual bias of a political essay.Note: most of these short essays have been already published and some are available on the net."
4,Nice Cover,"Note: the book cover uses the same design as her earlier ""NoLogo"". This is called ""building the brand""."
2,i really tried to like this I really did,"Somebody has to find a way to make this subject realistic and interesting, but this book ain't it. You ought to try to read this book. You really need to absorb the material. Just know that it won't be easy.That being said, this is probably the ""standard"" book on the subject, and you ought to have it on your shelf. I point at mine a lot. Once you fight your way through it, you probably will too."
3,"The example, NUMMI used in this book is obsolete","The ideas presented in this book is great, but unfortunately the author is not keeping up with latest development in NUMMI plant.Read a news article from this link to read what the Toyota own comment on NUMMI plant.(...)Quote...After being named North America's second-best plant in 2001 behind Toyota's Canadian plant in Cambridge, Ontario, the Georgetown, Kentucky, Toyota plant ranked number 14 in the last J.D. Power survey.The NUMMI plant in California is below Toyota standards, with quality scores of the Toyota Matrix and Pontiac Vibe, which is also built there, well down the rankings."
5,A very good value,"I've seen other books on ""Lean"" and ""Lean Production"" carrying much higher prices for less than half the content. This book is a good value and easy read - explains the history of Toyota and then carries their expansion and influence across the water to the US and our challenges. I'm not necessarily obsessed with Toyota - the principles actually started with Ford and the book aptly gives credit to Henry as well."
5,Why Toyota will recover from the current crisis,"I wish I would have read this book before I started studying any of the Lean/Six Sigma literature or even the Theory of Constraints for that matter. This book does an outstanding job of explaining the concepts Toyota developed through the years that heavily influenced the Lean/Six Sigma literature. I found myself reading the book to see how Toyota could have faltered as they have of late, but what I found instead was good proof of why Toyota will recover from this. Toyota has always been known for encouraging its workers to stop a line or an entire factory to avoid up stream errors. This was echoed in a recent news article stating how Toyota had stopped new car production to get a grasp on how to fix this issue and move forward to reclaim their reputation for quality. In my opinion, this book is a must read for anyone in the Manufacturing industry or business in general."
5,Excellent Overview of Toyota Principles,"I found this book to be very useful in describing the overall Toyota philosophy as well as the principles of Lean Manufacturing. If you desire to build a business based on continuous process improvement, superior customer value and long-term thinking, this book provides an excellent model for building your own corporate culture along a proven Toyota methodology. I ordered additional copies for all of our Sr Mgmt...excellent book...highly recommended."
5,Philisophical Landmark,"The is the pinnacle of literary knowledge of ""The Toyota Way."" No other book best illustrates the working principles of Toyota's philisophical foundation. The knowledge derived from this book goes beyond just manufacturing. The book is enriched with values and core principles that any ""good to great"" company should or have employed. The greatest enjoyment from the book, besides the learning, is being able to actually apply and live the Toyota Way.Information Technologywwww.nummi.com"
5,Great look into a great company,"This book allows a deep look into a wonderful company. Toyota is known for it's manufacturing methods and most writers miss the important ""respect for people"" pillar of Toyota. Jeffrey Liker shows that this is the key pillar missing in most of what we call ""lean"" organizations."
5,Operational excellence as a strategic weapon,"The Toyota Way certainly does provide the foundation of using operational excellence as a strategic weapon. With increased competition, companies are continuously challenged to achieve operational excellence in a better way than its competitors, and use this as their strategic weapon or at least ensure that they are meeting/exceeding industry standard in this area. This book contributed many ideas to my MBA dissertation, in creating a profit for an insurance company that had been making continuous losses for a number of years. The continuous process flow mentioned in the book was adopted and resulted in significant cost savings, by eliminating certain processes and improving the quality control.This book has also influenced me to purchase a Toyota Fortuner, moving from the Honda brand that I had driven for years.Judith Kean, FCCA"
5,Never too late to lean,Read this book if you want to lead change in your business. Study and practice it if you want to see change happen. The ideas are time tested and no doubt you've seen them at work in your business or as a customer. Read and act on the knowledge within. It's never too late.
4,Lean Construction,"Book is an excellent guide to ""thinking outside the box"" to adapt conveyer line assembly work to construction projects."
4,How to do it well,"I work in the shipping department for a newer Toyota supplier and was intrigued by the way TMMI pulled orders, so I picked up this book on my own. It is a lot of information to digest, but I thought worth it. A lot of times I was laughing as I read because I remember a couple of years ago when everything at my employer was ""5S"" this, lean that - only they had it all wrong and management's interest fizzled after a couple of months. In the case of our plant manager, thirty years of manufacturing experience puts him at a disadvantage, especially with the concept of producing in small quantities and doing more version changes. I think management should definitely get with this program, because soon it will be what has to happen to be competitive."
5,Very good CD!,"I really like the young voices of the group new kids on the block, the songs are so good and make you feel good when you hear them."
3,the tuff zone,"Hangin' tough is about hangin tough in the park. its easy to act tough around your homies. But when your out on your own you can listen to this song to get inspired to hang tough. Now the only question is, are you tough enough to be in the NKOTB?"
5,Classic,"I never thought I'd say it, but this album is a classic because this help paved the way for the boy bands of today. Even though the boys took a fall throughout the years some people would want to witness the falls of boy bands like the Backstreet Boys & NSync later on. My favorite song on this disc is ""my Favorite Girl"". This is also a classic because it had 5 top 10 hits!"
1,why whY wHY WHY????,"I really can't stand NKOTB! They couldn't sing at all! Their songs sounded so manufactured and fake! And because of them we've had to put up with all those NKOTB wannabes like BACKS**T BOYS, 'N STYNC,etc. I'm glad they did break up! now all we need is for BSB and 'N Cest to break up"
1,Perfect Example For Birth Control.,"I remember like it was yesterday's garbage pick up, when these guys were being played on the radio, it was like ""the black-plague"" of all music out there. And kids were buying into this load of bologna, I'm mean, man how fake do you have to sound than this Hanging loogies record. Girls were going ape, and us boys weren't getting any attention, only to see our girlfriends with their dumb posters on the walls at their parents house, pure evil I must tell you. Well anyways, as I'm venting over here and dry-heeving chunks deep down inside, is as fake as Milli-Vanilli, and hate to say this, I actually liked them better, scary huh?!@#@!eek This album deserves -5."
2,Eh.,"I didn't realize I had never heard this album back when they were big. It's not the type of music I like to hear from them. If you liked it when you were younger go ahead and get it. But if you have never heard it, listen to the clips if you can."
5,LOVE IT!,"I'm a HUGE New Kids fan and since I only ever had the cassette tape, I thought it was time to upgrade to a CD. It is even more fun to listen to than I remember!"
2,"After a few months, stopped working","I used the spray with vinegar. Assumed from the description of the item that it would work fine. But after six months the bottle stopped spraying. I still feel the resistance when pulling the trigger, but nothing comes out. When I opened the spray mechanism to check, I could see deterioration in the o-ring of the spray spout."
1,"Poor design, short product life","The top of the bottle sheared off during use. The bottle, full of vinegar, fell to the floor. The sprayer and the threaded top of the bottle remained in my hand. This was the second Lisle spray bottle I purchased from Amazon, since the first sprayer failed after very short use.To replace the Lisle bottles, we purchased a 4-pack of Envirokind wide-mouth spray bottles made by Delta Industries for $3.97. These have adjustable spray nozzles and a more user-friendly design. Amazon carries a similar product, which is a much better value than the Lisle spray bottles.http://www.amazon.com/Delta-82413-32-Spray-Bottle-Ounce/dp/B000HMBJ74/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s;=home-garden&qid;=1280331862&sr;=8-3http://www.amazon.com/Envirokind-Household-Sprayer-16-oz/dp/B000KL1OFY/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s;=home-garden&qid;=1280332236&sr;=8-6"
5,"Sturdy spray bottle eases ""Green Cleaning"" methods.",We keep this bottle with a mixture of distilled white vinegar and water handy for kitchen counter spills and let it sit a minute or two to disinfect as well.An excellent spray bottle and well made.
1,Does not last long,50% bleach is all I use in bottles. This bottle lasted only a few weeks using it moderately in the home. The pump wore out slowly and then failed completely. I have long experience using bottles for bleach and this was the shortest time I could use it.
1,Poor quality,The bottle neck (to which the sprayer is attached) BROKE OFF. This has been used lightly --- only twice filled with household vinegar !
1,A very cool reception,"I have purchased several books on Amazon that are published by the author, through a ""vanity press."" I have done so because I am looking for opinions and analysis that deviates from the mainstream, that might be controversial, or have a unique viewpoint. This book was without merit.On Page 82 the Author suggests that, ""A very cool US reception to this book is almost a sure thing."" He was correct, it was a matter of content not conclusion.Public domain analysis regarding the sad state of government accounting, unfunded liabilities, and serviceability of debt abound.I recognize that a scathing review on Amazon could severely impact saleability. It should."
2,Really disappointing,"Wow, did I make a mistake purchasing this item. First, it is not easy to assemble by ANY means (I am talking about the balance bar), and I cannot even attach it to the trampoline properly so that is remotely useful. Please do not waste your money by shelling out extra for the balance bar.The tramp itself is just okay. My feet and ankles pronate badly on the mat. This is not a comfortable bounce at all. I bounced slightly on it for about 10 seconds, and I strained or pulled a calf muscle and something in the top of my foot.I am very far under the weight limit of 300 lbs, but it feels like it's going to give out under me.Maybe it'll work for others, but not for me. I am so disappointed."
4,exercise for a caretaker,"I am a private caretaker companion currently assisting someone who can't be left alone. The cellerciser is just the ticket for me. I can use it in her home (I'm on 24/10 then off for 5 days in her home).I keep my sanity, my health and happiness by bouncing every day.It keeps my figure in shape also...because of hip problems I can only bounce lightly...no matter, I still get everything I need until I can have a day off.I recommend this product for anyone who has a hard time getting out for a walk or to the gym. AND, you don't have to be fit to benefit...I think this is the best equipment for couch potatoes, or anyone who doesn't like exercise, because it is fun, it makes you feel much better, and you can stay indoors, or out, which ever you choose."
1,Sizing is just stupid,"There are various sizes when it comes to these garter belt. When I ordered I was a size 16, and I think I bought the 5x. In any other product a FIVE X would be falling off, and just way way to big. This damm thing was way small,and not sexy. No woman wants to feel that 5X is too small, like she's a massive cow.Not sexy. Also, the garters kept coming off the stocking tops. I have heard others complain about this. I'd say pass, unless you find a shop that carries them, so you can see and try them on first. Also shipping took a few weeks.I am so disappointed. Still looking for a sexy garter belt with tummy control. So far years of digging, nothing has come up. I will probably have to hire someone to make something like this for me.:-("
3,sizing?,"If you purchase this item, buy it a size or two larger than what you need. Otherwise you are likely to have bulges under your skirt!"
5,"Review for ""Racing the Giants"".","The movie was excellent in content, story and good values. It was inspirational and encouraged doing our best at whatever we do. The movie showed the value of faith in God in the difficult times and in times of joy and celebration. Whatever we do, we do to the glory of God."
5,YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS FILM,"This is a must see for anyone,with faith or without. I have shown it to many of our friends and they said they were going to buy it asap."
5,Powerful...,"So many times we forget that we have to believe and that is what gets us where we are going. When we try to do it on our own its like spinning our wheels. THe movie brings so many aspects to truth like how we should behave when we are leaders, how we should try even though the goal line seems like an unreachable destination, believing even when you can't see the outcome. I wasn't going to watch this movie because football stories just aren't what I would call spiritual stories! The main character makes a fool out of me....it is a wonderful story. No, it is not hollywood affects but if you are listening to the story, you don't need them!"
5,Facing the Giants DVD,So happy to get this DVD for myself and lowest price I've seen anywhere! It's always worth checking Amazon first for bargains!
3,inspirational,this is a great movie for the family to watch with an amazing message . truely inspirational
3,Quick service,"Good service, arrived ahead of schedule. Would like to see more wholesome movies on the market. Christian movies are hard to find, good job."
1,BEWARE: Beats you over the head with Religion,"Love sports movies about overcoming (Rudy, Remember the Titans, etc). This movie, instead is a movie about God and Christianity thinly veiled in a sports movie. Literally couldn't finish it as the religious ""messages"" became so pervasive I couldn't continue. Regret the purchase..."
1,Avoid at all costs,"One of the most pedantic, predictable and pandering movies it has ever been my misfortune to watch. The performances are terrrible, the dialogue trite and simplistic, the story is horribly contrived, not to mention providing a foolish moral: pray to a Christian God and all your troubles will miraculously solve themselves. What disturbed me most was the unsubtle themes of racial and religous intolerance. The people who made this film should be deeply ashamed. Heck, as a Christian myself I feel ashamed by association simply for having watched this piece of drivel. Save yourself some money, ignore the artificially inflated rating and avoid subjecting yourself to this pile of excrement-covered celluloid."
5,My Kind of Football movie,"This was a movie that speaks of what sports really should be. The acting wasn't the very best I have seen, but better than most. The story line was engaging and the message was fantastic. I had gotten tired of ""underdog sport"" movies but when this one came out and I saw it, I was hooked. This is also a movie that my husband showed to the young men (teenagers) in the youth group he taught and they loved it.Highly recomend it!"
5,Facing the Giants video,"This is one of the best movies ever made. We are Christians, but this is an excellent Christian movie for anyone who is not a Christ follower, also. 5 Stars!"
4,Terrific Family movie,"We watched this movie as a family and loved the fact that it focused on the God, the people and the story line. No need for violence or harsh language. Lots of laughs!"
4,Facing the Giants,"Setting: High School Football somewhere in the South. Excellent movie for anyone, especially children. The actors are not movie stars, just plain folk from a church. However, their producing and acting abilities equal those of many Hollywood professionals. The moral of the story is work hard, stay focused, and trust in God. Once the failing coach and his team members changed their attitude, they faced their opponents with unbridled optomisism and strength to conquer and finally win the State Championship."
2,God on your side in football?,Christian propaganda that doesn't reflect even true Christianity.I can't see Jesus who refused to fight the Romans encouraging football.In my opinion football is the American form of the Roman gladiatorial games where slaves were made to kill each other for entertainment.You have to realize that it is the Muslim version of this type of storythat gets terrorists to drive cars full of explosive into crowdedcities.Do we want our children taught that kind of hate?Learn who Jesus really was:the meek and mild man who turned the other cheek.He told others to put down the swordand love their enemies.The Southern Fundamentalist Christians have lost Godand deny Jesus and His faith.They make a football God who bombsthe defenseless in the night using high technology.
3,"Clean family movie, but very fundamentalist Christian","My kids could watch this movie with me, but I would have to explain what getting checked for being able to have kids means to them. It was uplifting, but a bit on the preachy side. I am a very conservative Catholic, but this movie was more like one of the hands in the air praising movies. A young football coach and his wife fall on hard times (his team isn't winning, she isn't able to get pregnant, their house and car are falling apart), and then he turns to God for help. Everything starts turning around for them and the team. The rest you can fill in the blanks easily. It is a very predictable movie, but upbeat and a good message."
1,"Bad Acting, Predictable Plot, Cheesy Message","I don't often write reviews but I was so turned off by this movie that I felt compelled to warn others not to waste their time or money on this one. The acting is the worst I've ever seen, the dialogue is extremely stilted, and the biblical messages--while worthwile--are presented in such a blatant way that you feel you've been beaten over the head instead of allowing you to think and reflect about a deeper message. As other reviewers have said, the movie presents God as some type of genie--the minute the characters follow His Word, everything changes for the better. Life isn't this neat and tidy and it would have been more believable if the characters experienced even minor challenges throughout. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that there is no violence or swearing so it would be suitable for kids."
5,Must have Christian Film,"'Facing the Giants' has become my theme movie during these dark economic times, reminding me that God can do anything, even when circumstances say differently. The story line is fast paced with conflicts between the coach and the football player's fathers, whose only motivation was to win games. When the emphasis became on honoring God in all they did, that's when everything turned around, not just in the coach's and player's lives, but it affect the entire school and the parents. I strongly recommend this film for all ages."
5,Facing the Giants,Awesome movie!Great family values. Great spiritual wisdom.A must see movie.A movie that should be in everyone's library
5,Facing the Giants,"My husband, son and I just watched this movie. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen...based on the meaning of the show. The acting could have been better but that would not have stopped me from buying it. The true meaning of this movie is a key factor of why I bought this movie. I would suggest anyone with teenagers to watch this movie...it would be a perfect gift for the coach so he could let his team view this film."
4,Encouraging and uplifting,"I would have to say that the acting is not the best in the world. The good storyline and Christian values really make it work. My children ages four and seven, my husband and I all enjoyed the movie."
4,Great movie with great values!,"I just watched this movie and it brought tears to my eyes. The central theme of the movie is that with God, all things are possible. It tells the story of how a Christian school had a revival after someone had been praying for that revival for a long time, and the revival came through the school football team, and God took the team all the way to the state finals. It also tells the story of the coach and his wife's infertility and that with God, all things are possible!It is reported that the cost of this movie was $100,000, and majority of the cast and crew were volunteers. It is also reported that it raked in $10,000,000 by 1 Jan 2007. This is truly the 100-fold increase!Eventhough the production may not be as polished as Hollywood production, but the values that it portrays are better than some G-rated movies and cartoons. This is a great family movie, a must watch for all Christians... truly... WITH GOD, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE!"
5,One of the best,"I used to run a Christian video website and was associated with a Christian video store, so I'm familiar with many Christian films. Facing the Giants is one of the best Christian films I've seen. And the cinemtaography has improved since Sherwood Picture's first release, Flywheel. Again, an emotional film. And yes, I know the DVD isn't out yet. I saw the movie in the theater (though I had to drive over an hour to see it, despite being in the Detroit Metro area)."
5,Great movie with an incredible message,"I saw a free preview of this ""Facing the Giants"" at a local movie theater several weeks before it's theatrical release. It's a stirring and emotional film.I had read a few reviews that said if you want to see a football movie, go see ""Invincible"" or ""Gridiron Gang"". That review missed the point. It confused ""Facing the Giants"" as a movie about football - it's really a movie about faith set to the backdrop (an effective backdrop) of a high school football team.The acting isn't great but this movie wasn't made by a big time film studio - it was made by a church that has a message to deliver: with God, all things are possible. If that message isn't appealing to you, you may not like the movie. But it's hard to not want to stand up and cheer at the end of the movie.There's one scene in the movie that really stands out for me - the ""death crawl"" scene is very powerful and will stick with me for a long time."
4,A family movie with a great message!,"Facing the Giants is a story of a fictional football team and coach who decide to put the fate of their lives in God's hands. The story is very predictable and has the production value of a Lifetime original movie, but nevertheless, it is fantastic. The production value doesn't take anything away from the message of this moving story. A must watch for any Christian or any PERSON who is facing their own giants (and who isn't?) An all around feel good movie that is fun to watch with the whole family."
3,gettng better,"i am glad to see Christian movies are getting better, but don't expect a great movie from this. it's not. The acting makes you laugh at times and the dialogue is poorly written. However, if you are a Christian and you want a inspirational movie, this is a good movie for what it is. Christian movies are still hitting mediocre, mostly but we are getting better."
5,A Continuing Inspiration,"I've read past reviews that like to nitpick at the technical parts of movies but when it comes to Facing the Giants movie, I don't really care. I find this movie to be inspiring for my every day life. I continually watch the scenes where Brock does the Death Crawl to show that we all have the capability to go beyond what we think we can do. I'm also impressed with the scene where the older gentleman comes in to tell the coach he still has a door open where he is. I love the story about the two farmers who prayed for rain but only one prepared his fields to receive it. Later in the movie, when the coach decides to kick an impossible field goal for the win in the championship game, he statement is ""I'm preparing for rain"". I think this is a great movie and I'm inspired every time I watch it."
5,WOW a Christian movie on Blu-ray!!!,"This is the best Christian movie ever made. Most look cheap but this is on par with ""Radio"" a Hollywood blockbuster. I was very surprise to see it on Blu-ray also Heck yea I brought it to replace my DVD.My favorite scene is at the start of the movie where coach Grant Taylor just lost a game that could have gave him his first winning season since coming to Shiloh.Then for the next min they play music and show the goal post in every detail. This is where you see Grant is a total mess and helpless and he needs a miracle.Buy the Movie and see what happens when you let go and let God take over."
5,AWESOME faith based movie!,"All I can say is we loved this movie, what a good faith based family movie. It never got boring and at the end I was wanting more--good movie a must for your library!"
5,Facing the giants,INCREDIBLE movie. Great for the whole family. It is not just about football it is about life. Great values for all ages.Finally a movie you do not have to be embrassed to watch with your family and friends.
5,Facing The Giants,"This is my all time favorite movie! It's wonderfully made, even though it was made on a limited budget. The story line is great--a must see for the entire family!"
5,Excelente Produccion,"es una excelente producción, cinematográfica basada en principios de Reino muy acogedores y relevantes dentro de esta generación que cada vez se degrada en este sistema de confusion..."
2,Great Movie - Not able to download!,I purchased this movie for my daughters tablet. It said that it was user friendly with the tablet. Once I paid for it - I was told that it did not work with my tablet. Now I have paid for a movie that I cannot use! Not good!!
5,This is a must see!!,"This is an awesome movie. If there are things in your life that you are facing, by the time you finish viewing this moving, you will definitely have a clearer understanding of what you need to do."
1,Talk about cliche....,"I commend the Sherwood church for their effort in putting out a family-friendly, good-feeling type of film. But for crying out loud, watching this movie will show you why the secular world doesn't take Christians seriously. It was so full of cliche situations and responses it isn't funny. The acting is absolutely HORRIBLE---why in the world did they use church members to populate the cast? A little realism would be a much better testimony---things don't always work to perfection for believers in the real world. The absolute low point of the movie is the shifting wind direction that allows the little guy to hit the state-championship-winning field goal (of course, coming after he prays to God for help in making the kick)---spare me, please."
1,"Can't put 0 stars, but this movie is BAD","Can't put 0 stars, but this movie is BAD, with a huge review writing campaign, that fooled fools like me into renting this garbage - unwatchable!"
1,ZERO STARS! Amazon won't let you rate less than 1. Not a football movie!,"Reading the other reviews makes me want to amend the Constitution to include a clause insuring separation of Church and Film Criticism. This preachy movie has the worst actors in a cliche of a film which would have been too long if they cut it by half. I can think of nothing good to say about this movie, if you want religious inspiration, read your Bible, Torah or Koran. My son wanted a football movie and we were stuck with this drivel. It should carry a parental advisory so only the born again religious cheerleaders who filed the other reviews would rent or buy it."
1,Low budget movie,This is a horribly low budget movie. Typical of the Christian producers trying to make a Hollywood movie but miserably failing at it. After watching 10 minutes of this movie I took out of the player and tossed it in the trash. It has one central theme... god god god. pa - the - tic. It was bad. REALLY BAD. Don't waste your money on this one. Keep looking for another movie.
5,Facing the Giants is a Giant,This movie is very well done. It will have you on your feet and off your seat. It will have you reaching for a tissue. Great movie.
4,Great movie,"As a priest, I'm always looking for new ways to teach people (especially the young) about the love of Christ and the power of conversion. This movie is a great example of that. I'd recommend it to anyone who does youth ministry, or who simply want to watch an inspirational movie that the whole family can enjoy."
4,Facing the Giants,A great movie about a grea christian coach who rallies his team to win the championship. A fantastic offer for those who are stuggling with identity as Christians.
5,A Great Faith movie,For any one wanting a movie to get you to see beyond your situation and to trust God all the way and to face your giants this is the one to watch.
4,A must watch for dads with teenage boys,A great demonstration of what God can do when you honour him in whatever you do in your everyday life
4,Great Movie,"A football coach who is facing being fired and having trouble conceiving a child with his wife feels overwhelmed and turns to Christ to help him through the tough times in his life. The message of the movie is that while you can't control what happens in life, you must give it your all anyway. He decided that whether or not his team wins, whether or not he keeps his job, whether or not he can have children, he will do his best in every endeavor in his life and glorify God regardless of the outcomes.His wife is played by a sweet and lovely actress who faces her own hardship as a woman who wants children and is having trouble conceiving. Many of the teammates have personal issues they must also overcome.This is a great family film, very uplifting, and I'm glad I came across it."
4,Great movie with great values!,"I just watched this movie and it brought tears to my eyes. The central theme of the movie is that with God, all things are possible. It tells the story of how a Christian school had a revival after someone had been praying for that revival for a long time, and the revival came through the school football team, and God took the team all the way to the state finals. It also tells the story of the coach and his wife's infertility and that with God, all things are possible!It is reported that the cost of this movie is $100,000, and majority of the cast and crew were volunteers. It is also reported that it raked in $10,000,000 by 1 Jan 2007. This is truly the 100-fold increase!Eventhough the production may not be as polished as Hollywood productions, but the values that it portrays are better than some G-rated movies and cartoons. This is a great family movie, a must watch for all Christians... truly... WITH GOD, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE!"
5,Football Coach Father and Former Player of This Sport,"I am 40 yrs old and I have never been moved by a movie like I was by Facing The Giants.I first viewed this movie with other 11&12 all-star football coaches and players.The movie impacted me so,I asked my wife to join me in watching the movie again just two days later.I found the second viewing more comfortable because of the fact of not having to continually block my wet face from 24 all-star football players."
4,Great Christian Movie,"I thought this movie had a great message. A friend of mine told me about it and we watched it one night. It moved me so much that I will buy my own copy. The acting was a bit on the bad side, so I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5, but other than that, it was a great message that everyone should watch if you are going through a tough time and feel that things are not working out in your life. It teaches you to continue to trust in God b/c with Him, all things are possible. You will reach your goal with Him as the Head of your life."
5,Facing the Giants,"Although you won't find Hollywood stars in the characters' roles, you will see ordinary people, like you and me, share a very uplifting story of challenging situations which daily test our faith in God and our belief in ourselves. This movie needs to be viewed by a whole family. The issues are universal and lessons can be learned by all age levels. One of my adult sons said, ""This ranks among one of the best movies that I have seen."" and I agree!!! It starts out slowly so stay with it. You will be glad you did!!!"
5,Great,"This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. You can watch it with your kids, and share with them the pleasure of having faith, never give up, believe in yourself and have courage."
5,Facing the Giants,A must have for every family. The Kendrick brothers send an important message to all ages. Both entertaining and thought provoking.
5,Fantastic Movie!,"Very inspirational movie...I highly recommend it. If you are looking for a motivational family friendly movie, you can't go wrong with Facing the Giants."
5,Exciting and compelling story of the power of faith.,Alex Kendrick does it again with this masterful and exciting tale of the power of faith. Great for all ages.
4,Good family movie,Really enjoyed this movie and the message behind it. Bought it for my husband for father's day and he enjoyed it as well.
5,Best Movie!!!!,This has to be one of the most inspiring movies I've ever seen. We bought several copies of this DVD to give to friends and family. This is one movie we will watch over and over.
4,"Christian themed, my family enjoyed it","OK, so it's not going to win any Oscars in March, as there is an amateur element that is quite obvious and there is a bit of cheesiness here (thus, the loss of one star). But how many movies can you get that allow the whole family to sit around and enjoy it without worrying about sexual innuendo, cursing, etc? There just are not many family movies around, and this one was not only family-oriented but obviously had a goal of glorifying Jesus. While my next door neighbor or co-worker may not find this to be a fun movie, my wife and three girls all enjoyed it...and they don't even like football. So, I say, get a tub of popcorn and have your family sit around the television on a Saturday night, but make sure you get the Kleenex ready for the women--they'll want to cry throughout!"
2,just the boring facts,"A hugely disappointing book, after waiting a long time for a reasonably priced copy to become available. It is simply a listing of Broadway and other shows that closed out of town or in previews. It lists some of the creative team, nothing about directors, choreographers, designers. It sometimes lists one or two stars names, but no other cast and tells you nothing about the reasons for closing. It lists the theatre in which the show closed but no other pre Broadway stops. If it closed in previews It does not tell you how many. The author really did a half assed job of researching this book."
5,The best i ever heard!,"I love Laura Pausini! She is the best!This is one of here best albums!One of my favourite songs are TRA TE E IL MARE (BETWEEN YOU AND THE SEA)! I can't explane the feeling when you listen to it. It is a beautiful song, like the others.She has released the songs TRA TE EIL MARE, IL MIO SBAGLIO PIÙ GRANDE (MY BIGGEST MISSTAKE), FIDATI DI ME and VOLEVO DIRTI CHE TI AMO (I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I LOVE YOU) and trust me, if you buy the CD it will be worth it.Laura 4 ever!"
