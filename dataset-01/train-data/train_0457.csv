1,no limit shut up,who even listens to no limit these days p's hour was back in 99-2000 when da last don dropped after that he sucked.
1,Horrible,"This is absolutely the worst text book I have ever read. It spends more time telling ridiculous stories about fictional people than it does giving proper information about the subject. Worst of all, the information is horribly outdated. If you want to learn anything about consumer economics in a sensible, well explained format, buy any book besides this one."
1,Not very good,"If these guys had decided to release an album under the name ""Joe and the Dudes"" just to see how they'd do without their already famous name, this album would be long forgotten. In fact, in this day of wonderful recording quality and post-primitive guitar technology, I cannot understand why anybody listens to 80% of Led Zeppelin's _oeuvre_. Page's guitar always sounds twangy, Plant's falsetto is only slightly pre-Bee Gees falsetto, and the rhythm section ... well, let's put it this way, I'll take Mike and Alex. What do these guys have that 10 bands since haven't had? Only fame. Yuck. I give it three stars to denote mediocrity."
5,Tangerine,"This is my favorite Zep disc and therefore one of my favorite discs, period. It's amazing that it hasn't grown in stature over time, as it's been perpetually underrated by fans and critics alike. What I find most enticing here is the use of acoustic instrumentation and folkier themes without losing the edge. Tangerine is my favorite here but nothing is bad- every song holds its own. Also great is the mildly psychedelic sweep of ""That's the Way"" and the thumping ""Bron Y Aur Stomp"" that for some reason makes me picture olde England (not sure why). Another fan of this disc is David Lowery from Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker- and it shows in some of his edgier early work."
5,What Zeppelin means to me,"This is certainly no heavy metal album. Not really heavy rock either, though it does have some heavy moments. It is bluesy and folksy and nuanced in a way that shows a real progression of the partnership between the members of Led Zeppelin. It really evokes the pastoral and seems simple but even after 20 years of listening I hear something new every time. My favorite distillation of all that is great about the greatest rock band ever."
4,What an album,"I have to admit. I'm a Zeppelin amateur. I am a diehard Hendrix fan, and I have every single Experience album, but I recently got Led Zeppelin 3, and I was blown away. It is just such a beautiful album. What an assortment of songs, just some great rifts and it's just a great sound. Believe it or not, I think ""Immigrant song"" is the worst somg on this album even though it's the most popular song on here. It just doesn't fit in with the rest of the style, which is a lot of calm of acoustic. But I highly recommend this album to a Zeppelin beginner, but as always I recommend anything by Sir Hendrix. (...)"
3,We Come From The Land Of The Ice & Snow,"Generally considered the band's first 'soft' step, LED ZEPPELIN III is, in fact, a pretty 'hard' LP. ""Immigrant Song,"" ""Celebration Day,"" ""Since I've Been Loving You,"" and ""Out On The Tiles"" are pretty heavy stuff--not exactly Fairport Convention.But Page was beginning to give Plant, he of the golden locks and hippy-dippy love songs, a bigger voice on Zeppelin records. The results were some of Led Zeppelin's finest moments: records with hard edges, soft mushy centers, and that big whompin' John Bonham core.And, if all else failed, Page would lay down another stunning guitar solo, as he does on ""Tangerine,"" a premonition of the sound the band would perfect on it's masterpiece, PHYSICAL GRAFFITI, a few years later.III is a transition piece, but a very good one, with several magical moments."
1,Low Fidelity Argentina Import,"Beware if you get an IMPORT from Industria Argentina be prepared to be very disappointed. I have enoyed Zepplin for forty years, THIS is not what the LP was like. It is hard to believe this was remastered, it is far worse than the original. I sounds like a bad pirarted copy. Both Innuendo Ent and MovieMars ship Industria Argentina copies."
3,One Of My Least Favorite Zeppelin Works,"Led Zeppelin III was created after II received very poor critical reviews and they were accused of not being able to write lighter material. LZ was never loved by critics back in the day, and not wanting to dodge the criticism they produced the more folksie, acoustic LZ III. It still has its share of rockers and most of the softer songs are also great after repeated listens, but that was always my balk about this album. It has to grow on you and even then, it doesn't compare to other albums in their repertoire well. Highlights include:Immigrant SongFriendsCelebration DaySince I've Been Loving YouTangerineThe casual fan won't find a lot to love here. It's better to start with their best-seller (untitled) aka Led Zeppelin IV or Zoso(Led Zeppelin refused to put any kind of identifier on their next album's sleeve to refute the claim by critics that their albums sold because of the band's name and not the songs)"
3,Classic Rock Outrageously Priced,"Led Zeppelin III is undisputably a rock and roll classic. It is not, however, the band's greatest album. Even at the sale price of US$13.99, this purchase really cut into our music budget for the summer. It is hard to imagine who would purchase an album of this calibre for the full price of US$18.98!I am going to look harder for the next album we want in vinyl."
2,jewel box was damaged when it arrived in the middle of two other albums,"I ordered three Led zeppelin albums. Two were fine, The Led zeppelin III jewel box arrived with several cracks in it's cover. Lets see if they fix the problem."
3,Zeppelin's mediocre release,"Led Zeppelin is one of the best hard rock bands of all time, if not the best (my personal pick is Metallica, but Zep ranks in a close second.) However, on ""Led Zeppelin III"", there is really nothing to recommend on this album. ""Immigrant Song"" is nice but much too short, and many other songs on this album don't make the grade (with the notable exception of ""Celebration Day"".) If you want a teriffic Led Zep album or albums, pick up ""Led Zeppelin I"", ""Led Zeppelin II"", or ""Houses of the Holy""."
1,Clips are not representative of the songs,"I could hardly understand what these people are saying. The non-representative clips on Amazon are very misleading. I wish I knew better, or I wouldn't have purchased."
5,Zep's best album,"Led Zeppelin III's many acoustic songs were perfected by Jimmy Page's shimmering acoustic guitar, the album's most easily celebrated hero. Despite their format these songs are every bit as exciting and intoxicating as the last two album's psychedelic electric rockers and fittingly show more lyrical sophistication. This album is a mammoth of melody, musical attraction and lyrically set sense paranoia. My favorite Led Zeppelin album."
4,The record of Israeli production. Exotic transparent red. Recorded very well. The envelope for this price is thin and poorly des,"The record of Israeli production. Exotic transparent red. Recorded very well. The envelope for this price is thin and poorly designed. Conventionally, you can listen to this record. It does not correspond to the first edition of design and black vinyl."
5,Best Led Zeppelin,"There is no question that their previous albums were full of energy and set our expectations for more of the same. Well, I found that this album was the richest of their creations. ""That's the way"" is my personal favorite with it's melodic guitar runs & Plant's vocals weaving their way through Page's strumming conclusion. ""Immigrant Song"" , "" Celebration Day""& ""Out on the Tiles"" with it's driving, pulsing sounds connect to their previous work. ""Bron-Y-aur Stomp"" & ""Gallow's Pole"" bring a diferent folksy tone to their music. ""Since I've been loving You"" is a classic blues rendition that touches the plight of the under-appreciated working man with Page's vocals driving through Page's winding guitar runs. This album definitely stands the test of time."
5,Most of this is acoustic... so what?,"To appease you Zeppelin fans who prefer their harder side, ""Since I've Been Loving You,"" is the most moving blues jam they ever did, and possibly the most emotional of any blues jam. Plant's vocals scream it all, along with Page's solos, Jones' organs, and Bonham's drumming. I loved ""Tangerine,"" ""Gallows Pole,"" and ""That's The Way."" ""Immigrant Song"" rocks too. Not a bad Zeppelin album at all. Perhaps, it's one of their best, though it's a very tough choice for me. I dunno why people worship ZOSO so much but criticize this one. Acquired taste I guess."
4,Led Zeppelin's most underrated effort,"I was reluctant to buy this album at first, hearing that it was one of Zeppelin's lesser efforts. Now I'm glad I did. Although it doesn't quite measure up to ZOSO and Physical Graffiti, LZ III is still a notable and worthy part of the Zeppelin catalog. Rejected by some because of it's high level of acoustic guitar and folk song sound, LZ III still has plenty of the variety fans have come to expect from Zeppelin albums. The styles range from hard rockers (the classic Immigrant Song, Celebration Day, and Out On the Tiles) to blues (Since I've Been Loving You) to just plain weird (Hats Off to Roy Harper) and of course folk (basically everything else). Most consider this an album for diehard fans only, but I say no Zeppelin collection is complete without it."
1,Mmm..not too pleased...,"I personally thought this was going to be a great quality of CD...but Not pleased with it. Is not the original...the paper, colors just tell you this is a ""copied"" disc from the original version. So, NO !"
4,ZEPPELIN'S BEST,"This is by far the best of Led Zeppelin's albums. The songs are accessible and can stand alone without the hype which accompanied the 4th album (particularly the track Stairway to Heaven). In fact it became fashionable to denigrate this album. Any album which contains Immigrant Song, not to mention classics like Gallows Pole, Friends, That's the Way and Bron-Y-aur Stomp has to have earned its stripes. Forget the putdowns of musical pseuds and buy this album. It is Led Zeppelin for *all* the people."
5,THIRD MASTERPIECE!!!!,"I love the first 2 LED ZEPPELIN albuns...Led III is on the absurd high quality level of them...This one got the monster hit IMMIGRANT SONG, FRIENDS, THAT's THE WAY, TANGERINE, GALLOWS POLE and CELEBRATION DAY...GREAT GREAT COLLECTION OF HEAVY and FOLK ROCK SONGS!!!"
5,One of my top 5 albums of all time,"I love zepplin, at first I didnt really like this album as much as I did others by them but finally I sat down and listend to the whole cd and it is amazing! a must buy!"
4,Good,"This is an excellent album, because Zeppelin explored their acoustic folksy side. The only song that i can live without is Hats off(to Roy Harper). That blows, and thats 4 stars. But Tangerine is probably L.Z.'s best ballad."
5,Underestimated...,"Ok. I seen, heard, and felt the anger about this album. There is nothing wrong about this album. Actually, I think this album is great. Its ok for a hard rock band to write stuff like this. The reason I gave this album a 5 was that it stood out from the rest, it was like gold on a black sheet. It was a key, or a base of Zeppelin, it was essential to be there. So i recommend this album."
3,Hmmm...,"It's called Gallows Pole, not Hangman. But it is by far my favourite song on the album. The Immigrant Song is good, but it seems a bit too short to really rank up there with Zeppelin epics like Kashmir and Achilles' Last Stand. Tangerine is also good. To be honest, the rest of it really doesn't stand out in my memory, so it can't have impressed me much. Still, I really love Gallows Pole."
4,Valhalla we are coming home.,"After the knockout punch of Led Zeppelin's first two albums, their third album was seen as a disappointment by some fans. Split down the middle between steam-shovel rockers and largely acoustic, folkish material, the album presents a rough blueprint for Zeppelin's towering monument."
4,Gotta love this album,"GREAT Zeppelin. The spotlight songs are Immigrant Song, Friends, Celebration Day, Since I've Been Loving You, and Tangerine. Don't really like Bron-y-Aur stomp, Gallows Pole, and That's the Way. Hats off to (Roy) Harper is bad. REALLY bad! It is kind of funny to listen to every once in a while."
5,Still Rockin after all these years!,"This like much of early Led Zeppelin's music it has a life and sound of its own.This is a rock classic for a reason, original quality rock is not common and unfortunately we often have to look to the older bands and artists to get the sounds we crave.This is a very strong offering, not as bluesy as Led Zeppelin #1, but there own style and sound is more fully developed in these cuts.Conclusion if you like Led Zeppelin you just need to own this!"
3,"Entertaining, but no lap dancing","Once I figured out this was a fish story, not a late-night Cinemax confession, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Stripah Love."" Other than a few mysterious flights of fancy (the hero is occasionally visited by a muse in whom resides all tidal wisdom) this is a sweet, funny story: A Hollywood ex-pat who finds romance and redemption in his childhood haunts; a liberal selection of tasty recipes; an easy read from an assured story-teller."
3,You'll enjoy this one.,"""Stripah Love"", set on the Massachusetts coast, is a tasty New England chowder, sort of a sophomoric blend of Carl Hiaasen and Jimmy Buffet, but with a Boston accent. If you're passionate about salt water flyfishing, you'll appreciate the metaphor of flyfishing as a path toward inner peace, a vision quest for vanquishing personal demons, and a return to one's roots. This is ultimately a droll, sweet little novel that's perfect for an afternoon on the lanai while you're waiting for the winds to calm...so you can go fishing. (The other book I've got going right now is ""Middlemarch""; OK, this will never be a ""Middlemarch"", but it sure was a pleasant break.)"
4,"An interesting, well-documented book","The author discusses the discovery of a crashed bomber in Papua New Guinea and the expedition to recover the remains, then describes the painstaking process of identifying the remains, and finally tells the story of the fatal flight and the men who were on the aircraft. This was an interesting book throughout; especially poignant were the descriptions of the family members who finally learned the fate of their loved ones more than forty years later. The New Guinea campaign and the role of the Fifth Air Force have been relatively neglected in histories of World War Two."
3,"Great Price, Disappointing Log Distribution","My children received this item for Christmas last year. Compared to Lincoln logs, the price can't be beat. The major disappointment that I have is that, of the 300 pieces, 193 of the pieces are the small, single notch, logs. There are only 4 long, three notch, logs and 4 long roof slats. Total there are only 6 roof supports. I wouldn't mind this so much of there were add-on packs that allowed you to buy more of the pieces you need (i.e. roof packs or long logs); however the way it is, one must buy an entire additional set with again, a disproportionate number of small logs. I do like the quality of the item, just disappointed in the distribution of the pieces."
3,Not the original Lincoln Logs - but a reasonable alternative,"I bought this as a gift for a family with 3, 4, and 6 year-olds. The good news was that there were lots of parts,so everyone could play together with minimal fighting (except over the two chimneys!). Some of the logs were not cut accurately, and therefore didn't fit together as well as they might have. The biggest difference fromt he original Lincoln Log sets is in how the roof is designed. This kit uses special logs which have an extra notch in them designed to catch the bottom roof slat. It is a more complex and less stable design than the original kit that used plastic rook peaks and would hold the roof together with less futzing.Regardless, the kids loved the kit, and a good time was had by all!"
5,Kids love to play with this toy!!!,Looked at more expensive building sets but decided to buy this one. Glad I did because it came with more pieces.
1,To many little pieces,"This product promises 300 pieces. Unfortunately, 200 of those are the tiny single size little logs. You can't build much with this toy. Rip off. I'd say pay the extra couple of bucks and buy a set that you can actually build things with, but unfortunately I can't find any others that don't have the same poor review. Hopefully you'll have better luck then me."
4,more bang for your buck,basic wooden logs. no weird smells that i noticed. lots of pieces. should have ordered a bigger set in hindsight.
3,Not Lincoln Logs,"Not Lincoln Logs! I purchased this set for my 5 year old and although he enjoys them, I was somewhat disappointed with the quality of the product. I guess that is why the Lincoln Log sets are so much more expensive. Although all the pieces are made out of wood, hence the 4 Star durability rating, they do not fit together nearly as well as the real Lincoln Logs. For the price not bad hence the three stars but if you want a quality building set go with the more expensive original Lincoln Logs. Chinese Lincoln Log Knock Off!"
4,Not too Bad!,"Like the Lincoln Logs, this set has way too many little single-notch logs and way too few long 3 and 4-notch logs. 300 pieces sound like a lot but but without the longer logs, building variety is limited. The set also needs longer gable pieces (like the Lincoln logs do) to build a roof more than 6 inches wide."
1,not enough variety,"There isn' enough variety of peices in this set. my son tried to build stuff with it, but there aren't enough roof peices or smaller peices. Just tons of big peices. I tried gettting creative and playing with them with him, but I soon realized that you just really can't put anything creative together with the lack of peices. I ended up donating the whole set to good will."
4,A classic !,I was surprised that his was just as good as the first. A very colorful and exciting movie! Revenge is the main subject and the villain is ruthless. A classic of the genre!
1,Horrible,"I got it used and got ripped off, I can see a few mins of the video and then the tape cuts to static, that being said it seems really dumb anyway, I got it real cheap, so it wasn't worth trying to return."
4,Gorgeous Dresses!,"I bought five dresses from this seller (The 15 Dollar Store) and they are breath taking! My only qualm is check the description of them, one that I got is 100% cotton, like I wanted, but the liner was nylon. The other ones had cotton liners. But the fit is great, wonderful detail and color! Efficient shipping and delivery. I will definitely order again!"
1,Boring beyond tolerance,"I have spent the last week reading this book. Mind you, I am not done. I have been trying very hard to be interested because I got it as a free download on my kindle. I thought I at least owed it to the author/publisher to read this. I can't anymore. It is putting me to sleep. I keep wanting it to be over... I read to be entertained or to be educated, this serves neither purpose.The concept of an alternative history of the United States is a plausable background for a novel and I love historical novels but this is giving me a brain freeze.I think it is time for me to hit that delete key on my kindle and move on to Eat Shoots and Leaves."
3,Featherston Is Back as the Confederate Hitler,"I've enjoyed Harry Turtledove's alternate history series of the United States of America versus Confederate States of America, but frankly can't wait for it to be over. He offers a feeble rewrite of the opening battles of the European sector of World War II, with Jake Featherston as the Confederate version of Adolf Hitler. Much to my amazement, Turtledove offers a credible version of what a Confederate Holocaust might have been like, using the term ""population reductions"" in lieu of the ""Final Solution"". Still, to his credit, Turtledove offers some interesting vignettes featuring a diverse cast of characters ranging from old-timer U. S. Navy officer Sam Carstens to U. S. Army pilot Jonathan Moss, and Confederate Brigadier General Clarence Potter, to name but a few. I suppose I'll read the sequels, but Turtledove has done much better work in the past."
3,Return Engagement?,"I have read all 7 previous books in this timeline, starting with How Few Remain. At first I found Turtledove to be creative and original, but with the last few books,Victorious Opposition, Return Engagement, he appears to have become lazy as a story teller.Return Engagement is simply the retelling of the Eastern Front of WWII with the CSA playing Germany (down to concentration camps) and the USA playing Russia (but no Gulags?). If you know how WWII ended then I suspect you will not need to read the next 2 books! The only way Turtledove could surprise me now would be if the Confederacy won, and I doubt it will."
3,"GREAT BUT, PREDICTABLE","Dr.Turtledove has now begun his new trilogy with Return Engagement, which was a good read but just too predictable.I wish the author would try and shake things up a bit; such as maybe killing Featherson or have something different like famous people showing up; (e.g. Reagan, nixon, etc.). I began reading the series when I was in Middle School, now a sophmore in High School I find the series waining. I believe Turtledove should do what he did with the WORLDWAR/COLONIZATION series and after SETTLING ACCOUNTS have a conclusion book. Now here's what I'll predict in that book:1)Reagan and Bush will sign a doctrine formally reuniting the states effective January 1, 1990.2)the Mason-Dixon wall will be brought down3)a psuedo IRA will appear in Utah consisting of MormonsAll and all the book was o.k. though I did enjoy seeing Louis Armstrong(Satchmo) making an appearence."
1,Too expensive even at $0.00,"I downloaded this book to Kindle because it was one of the free offers for the month, and I thought I'd try a new author. I'm afraid I didn't enjoy it much. I normally compulsively finish books I begin, but I deleted this one from Content Manager after the first two chapters.The storyline is that the South is fighting the North again, but this time, it is in the 1940's and the North has a Socialist President. And at least one female, single-mom, Socialist congresswoman. The story is written from the congresswoman's POV, and very much emphases intelligence and understanding over physical strength, so you'd think it would appeal to a woman, but it didn't hold my attention. I always felt as though I were reading a book, rather than slipping into another world.I did enjoy the free download of Charlie Huston's book (Caught Stealing) and am looking forward to reading more of Huston's books."
3,"Well, if you like oil based....","Having come from professional education of faux finishes utilizing water based products, this book leaves me with much to experiment with to adjust the recipes to water based products from the instructed oil based recipes in the book. Very detailed and beautiful marbling effects. Sienna, serpentine, yellow onyx, black marble and more are illustrated and fully instructed. Great pictures of faux marble finishes in lovely rooms to stimulate the imagination. I would really like to see a book with the great finishes using water based products. With today's great new glazes...I know it can be done"
2,cute but,"these are cute, and probably would work fine for slender feet, however the soles are hard with not much give and the straps do not like it if you feet swell in the heat, so if you feet don't sweat or swell and you don't mind hard soles and are just looking for cute sandels these are the sandles for you"
4,Deff getting this,I have best of raw 09&10 & the sd 09/10 dvd. This one is going into my collection. Id pay 20 bucks just for the punk stuff&the rock/cena fued stuff on here. As well as edges retiremnt&hopefully the matches on here are good ones
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I ordered this on November 2, and even though Amazon have been listing this as being 'in stock' for a week or so, my order still hasn't even shipped yet. I have asked Amazon to provide a reason for this, but they haven't done so... I think it's terribly misleading of Amazon to list something as being 'in stock' when orders placed two months ago haven't been filled yet.Buyer beware...."
5,"If you're a fan of Gene or KISS, you GOTTA HAVE THIS!","Totally cool set -- the A&E show rocks, and this set is going to be even better! Hours of Gene and two new songs on CD -- it doesn't get better than this........"
5,Loved It!!,"I just got my order - in record time, too (I ordered it on May 25th and had it in my hands on May 30th). That being said, it would have been worth it if it had taken weeks to get here. How wonderful - the little scrapbook with Gene's own commentary, seeing how openly warm and cuddly he is in regard to his children - despite the ""Demon Rock God"" image. It will be a cherished part of my DVD library - a must have for any KISS fan."
4,Gene Simmons - Family Jewels - Season One,bought for my son who is a GENE SIMMONS/KISS fan... Need I say more...
2,Not Happy!!,When I ordered this particular Set I thought I would get the Set that I saw and The exact Title Collector's Edition. Well that is not what I received I received a Plan DVD CASE with a Picture Of Season One and Just 2 DVD's inside! I would have Like to Know Before Hand that it wouldn't be the Collector's Edition!! I bought Season 2 from another Site and the only reason I didn't get Season One from that is Because I Really wanted this Special Edition and I didn't Get It! Not Happy! A little Disappointed But I got Season One!
5,fun to watch,Both my husband throughly enjoy watching Gene Simmons and his family. This DVD is a lot of fun to watch!
5,Gene Simmons - Family Jewels - Season One,"gene simmons have the funny show if your a kiss fan it a just have. you find out stuff you would have never knew about gene ,or gene"
1,Repeated posts,Some guy Wrote 3 phony reviews so i am making 3 bad reviews to counter act it. I have this book. Dont get it.
2,Rank beginners only,"This book is for rank beginners. The techniques discussed are not innovative and precious little is explained as to what size, weights, and blade shapes are most productive for particular stream structures and depths. I've seen too many beginning fishermen using an inappropriate spinner type and get frustrated easily. More types should be illustrated.The equipment section is not very helpful, specific rod and reel models would be more appropriate even for beginners. Too many times, beginners buy junk tackle and expect it to handle decent sized trout, it won't. The fish of a lifetime could strike your spinner on the next cast, be prepared for it and don't be disappointed.Spin Casting Brilliantly is better written and much more helpful."
3,Pretty simplistic but good basics.,"This guy does a good job on bass fishing but some of us like trout. The book is a short, easy read. Any fisherman will pick up some tips. However, it could be a lot better with more details on lure types to use and in what situations. JCG"
3,Not really entertaining,"This book is written by cavers for cavers and if you're not a fanatic caver it will probably be a little boring. After the first pages , the description of expeditions look all the same and it is easy to loose interest. To keep a non-caver entertained would have been a hard task even for very talented writers and these authors do not seem to stand above the average.The most interesting part is the first appendix, which narrates the history of past Mammoth Cave expeditions (back to ancient times). As stated also in the preface of the book, it is better to read this appendix first to have a better picture.3 stars."
4,Wish had charge indicator,"While the charger works perfectly, I wish it gave an indication of the status of charging. Other than that, it's a good product and does the job required."
3,Ok fix,"My charger failed this summer and required a new transformer. This one fits my device. I lost the charging light functionality, but overall meets the needs."
2,Ripped off on transformer,This transformer cost about a third of the entire unit!! I was scared into thinking only a B&D would work. The battery on my unit was bad so I paid a ton of money for nothing. Bought a Craftsman to replace B&D.
5,Overwhelmingly Breathtaking,"The first time I walked into the West Chicago, IL library after the Bhutan book was placed on display, I thought I had been transported to the Himalayas. Standing in front of these gorgeous mountains, I could feel myself being pulled in. Subsequent days as the pages were turned, I was impressed with the beauty of the area, the beauty of the people, the vibrancy of their costumes. I make a lot of trips to the library-don't want to miss a page. Thanks Dr. George Hawley for donating your son's wonderful work to West Chicago. Worth a trip to view where ever it is on display."
2,Eh...,"This is not a strong nor malty tea, the taste is average- nothing particular outstanding or to applaude. I have not experience the ""decaffinated"" effects of this tea, although the words do carry a placebo effect.I have found tea package in America/Canada from Twining do not have same quality as the Twining sold in England:London/Heathrow Airports. Just not the same in terms of the flavour. Very deceiving as it does not indicate on the website as where it has been packaged."
5,A good cuppa rosy lee,"After moving to the US from England, I searched long and hard to find a decent cup of tea. The usual US tea is weak compared to tea in England. Twinings Irish Breakfast Decaf Tea has great flavour. It's a very satisfying taste and the beauty of decaf tea is that even though it is stronger in taste, you do not feel wired. I would highly recommend this product."
3,Belkin Gaming Bridge,"This is NOT as easy to install for use with the XBOX as advertised. I did get it to work momentarily after disabling the security on my router/modem, but not likely to long term if that is what it takes to get the thing to work. Good luck and thank Microsoft.Belkin F5D7330 802.11g Wireless Ethernet/Gaming Adapter"
5,The Best,"Even though its made for gaming systems, I am using this card on my desktop because for some reason no one can produce a wireless PCI or USB adapter that doesn't drop out all the time. Product works flawlessly and NEVER drops the connection, better yet, it requires no drivers, so there is no possibility of compatibility issues on any system that has a working LAN adapter.I haven't check Belkin's website to see if they have downloads for other OS, but to run the included CD you will need a Windows OS. After that though, you could hook this up to any PC, MAC or gaming system with a working ethernet adapter.The only thing that probably bites some people is the set up, which could be a little friendlier for the non-technical people. You will have to know your SSID, your wireless key and how its encrypted (WPA, etc). If you don't know how to find these things, look around, because it would definitely not be worth passing up this great device."
1,Win Vista Unfriendly,"It's probably great if it works. But it didn't. Leastways, not with my network and windows vista."
1,Horrible support from Blekin,I purchased this product and it did not work. I called Belkin for support and got a run around. They finally determined the product was bad and issued a RMA. After waiting for several weeks I finally received an e-mail that they were discontinuing the product and would not replace it. I faxed my receipts twice to the number they provided and they said they never received the faxes so they would not issue me a credit for their online store. I finally gave up and wrote the money off as Belkin's support is not at all willing to help the customer. They are accusatory when I told them I faxed my receipts twice and that I have the confirmation that they were received. [...]
3,"Simple to use, fairly reliable","Setup for this was very simple and worked wonderfully. Since then I have had trouble with my wireless fluctuating in speed, but that may well just be the wireless due to the router. All in all, this was worth it.Update: 3 years later I am still using it, and that is good I guess, but once in a while (once a month maybe) I have to reset it up as it will connect to some other wireless network randomly rather than the one I manually set it to. Annoying."
3,"Does the job, but no Vista support","The adapter pretty much works as advertised and met my basic needs to link my DirectTV HD-DVR up to the Internet, but buyers should be aware that the configuration software runs only on Windows XP and Belkin does not as of this writing have a Vista update on their web site."
3,Not so impressed when it came to setting it up,It is too pricey compared to Buffalo ethernet converter which can act as a DHCP wireless. This one you can only be configured with a CD that comes with it not via IP address. I had to reset a couple of times to get it to work and I called support and they were not able to detect it. While waiting for support to call back when I was having issues. I then reset again and used a different laptop and wass able to get it detected and configured correctly to be used by my HD Dish receiver. It's a good wireles bridge but too Pricey.
4,Great add on to 20G PS3!,"I purchased this for $20 to use with my son's 20G PS3. He now has wireless internet access for gaming, browsing and PS3 software updates. It took less than 5 minutes to get it up and running on our wireless network. I would recommend this for anyone who owns the 20G PS3 (no wireless built in)."
2,Bridge does not work!,"The problem I am having with this product is that I am trying to use this in front of a network switch, but that does not seem to work. I have it working fine when connecting to just one computer, but when I place it in front of a switch, it only connects one of the computers. The other computer either can not get an IP address and on the occassions it does get an IP address, it won't can't communicate outside of the switched network (can't communicate with the router).If anyone has a solution to this problem, please let me know. I have tried the web config, but there wasn't really much you can do in there other than switch the adapter's ip from static to DHCP."
1,couldnt get it to work,I purchased this item for my direc-tv hd dvr to access my home network to get on demand. I couldnt get it to work using the enclosed cd. I couldnt get it to work after hours and hours with the Belkin support people. I hired a computer expert to try to get it right and he had no luck. I returned the item and gave up on the whole idea.
2,A singularly dull read,"_Yellow Fever, Black Goddess: The Coevolution of People and Plagues_ could have been a penetrating examination of the relationship between humanity and disease. Christopher Willis certainly had fertile ground to work, but the book ends up being a dull and pedantic trudge that fails to bring the best of the academic or the popular to the reader.The text wanders through evolutionary biology and human history without any real sense of direction. The biographies and personal histories read like indifferent `human interest' stories injected into an otherwise uninteresting science news broadcast."
1,Not worth it,"I am a student working on a project/report for this book and sadly i had volutarily purchased it thinking i was in for a good book. Not the case. Although it is informative, most people aren't university professors reading up on their evolution. It is DULL and i ended up reading about 2/3 of the book because the project was due soon and you probably dont care, anyway i have since read the whole book and it bored me into writing this. Wills absolutely does not succeed in fulfilling its title. So if you are doing a project DO NOT PICK THIS BOOK. NEVAR. EVAR. sry Chris Wills...u did it to yourself..."
3,So Sad,"The nuts and bolts on this are SO HUGE for the scale of the skeleton. They stick way out past the arm and hip bones and look horrible. Now that I have it in front of me, I can see them in the picture, but they are just so much more obvious in real life."
5,EPIC!!!,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVAH!!! My friends and I have been playing it all week in classes where our exams our done and it keeps us going to whole period. It is EPIC!
5,Very GOOD!,"The object of the game is to get powerful pokémon,and head to the Elite four(or Gary). Sound Easy? Well It is Not. With people challenging you, The Elite Four is really tough, but it is still is a good game. My Opinion:Buy It. It will get bigger. This Is the best Board Game I ever Played"
4,perfect for pokemon fans,"If your children LOVE pokemon, this game was made for them. Many of the strategies used in the trading card game can be applied here, but you don't need to collect the cards to play. My son loves this game when he's playing with friends that don't have the cards."
4,Fun for Everyone! Great Family Game,"My son loves to play this game. His dad and I also play. It gives us some insight into his Pokemon ""world"". Getting the rules down is time consuming at first but smooth sailing after that. Good educational toy. Teaches math and strategy."
2,Among The Best Police Academy movies,"Well, this isn't so good because of the humor, but the one extra star goes to the criminals. The best thing with the movie is the ending battle, where the cops finally meet som criminals that match up with their qualities. Still pretty poor piece of film."
2,"AN IMPROVEMENT OVER 5, BUT THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH","THE COPS COME BACK TO BATTLE ANOTHER CRIMINAL. A BIG STEP UP FROM THE LAST INSTALLMENT, BUT THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH. STILL MORE OF THE SAME OLD TIRED JOKES. LET'S FACE IT, WITHOUT STEVE GUTTENBERG, THE ''POLICE ACADEMY'' SERIES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME."
1,Boring.,"This is a very boring movie to watch,and to sit through.The script is terrible,and the cast does terrible jobs at playing their roles.Do not,and I repeat do not watch this [movie],or buy it."
2,Boring!,"This movie is so stupid. It is not even that funny. Okay guys I think it is time to call it quits. 1 was okay so was 2,3,4. Five was fair. So If you really want to see it rent it."
3,definate improvement over Police Academy 5,"Even though I did not like Police Academy 5, I decided to give this one a chance and I'm glad I did. Sure, Police Academy 6 doesn't have Steve Guttenburg in it but its still a good movie. G.W. Bailey gives a better performance as Captain Harris than he did in the last movie. Also, the plot is more interesting unlike the last movie. If you are a fan of the Police Academy series, you might want to include this one in your collection. In my opinion, Police Academy 6 should have ended the series. Word of caution; don't bother viewing Police Academy: Mission Moscow."
1,One of the worst movies I've seen...,"This film is devoid of any humor what-so-ever. It tries to think of something funny to do, but leaves the viewer bored and wishing something else were on. I happened upon this movie on HBO one day and didn't laugh once. It's simply one of the worst comedies ever created. Never funny, ..."
4,Chevy Chase at his best,"This was a good movie with a great plot. Clearly Chevy Chase at his best.I would also like to say that this may very well be the funniest Chevy Chase movie since ""Fletch""."
4,The marketing standard bearer,"Phillip Kotler is an internationally recognized name in marketing, and this introductory text (undergraduate or MBA-level) is a comprehensive resource on the subject. It provides a framework for analyzing marketing opportunities and making strategic decisions with respect to the marketing mix to maximize customer value. This latest edition was written with the Internet in mind and how it has changed marketing strategy. The only problem with the book may be its comprehensiveness because it tries to cover every conceivable topic. That makes it a handy reference, but you may need to consult other resources on both marketing and strategy to get a deeper understanding."
5,A Must Have for Every Homeowner,"I would highly recommend Vicki's book! She is the 1st person that is not a mold victim, that has been able to capture the issue. This book is a must for every homeowner, property owner, and renter in the country! Thanks, Vicki for a truely wonderful book!"
3,Why can't the editor spell?,"This book gets serious stars taken off for unprofessionalism. It's one thing if the author can't spell, but her editor is supposed to catch her errors. This important practice can't hope to be taken seriously if the editor couldn't even spell the title of the book. The correct spelling is ""herbology"" and means the study of herbs. Geez."
4,Cross-cultural Herbal Guide,Indian Herbalogy of North America by Alma R. Hutchens is a helpful reference book for those desiring a greater understanding of cross-cultural applications of herbs. The title is somewhat misleading because though there is an emphasis on Native American herbalism there is also a great deal of information regarding Russian herbology and folklore.
3,GYPSY,"HAVE BOUGHT BEFORE AND ITEM LAST ABOUT 18 MONTHS FOR OUTDOOR POOL SCREEN DOOR.FAST SHIPMENT. VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE, HANDLED PROBLEMS FAST AND COMPLETE.WOULD BUY AGAIN."
4,THAT'S MY GIRL,"Missy is the number two female MC on my favorite rapper list. She shows why on this album. The single ""SHE'S A BITCH"" was a great way to hype the album, because there are some harder cuts on the album other than that one. I especially like the Lil Kim interludes, since I'm a big Lil Kim fan."
3,So-so,"I must admit: i bought this cd on the strength of All N My Grill (nice to hear MC Solaar sounding strong as ever!) and She's a B****. Apart from those, the only track i give a special mention is Crazy Feelings. I can't deny i was a little disappointed."
5,This CD is a biggitebomb party CD!!,"I reviewed the title the plot of her songs what they meant and why she would pick them, it all turned out exelet so I really recomend this CD"
5,it is one of her best cd,I LOVE THIS CD IT IS THE BEST ONE I HAVE.IN EVERY SONG THERE IS A GOOD BEAT AND THE RAPPIN IS GOOD!
5,i love her new sound and lyrics my favorite song is shes a b,missy ilove her and her album i think evry one shuld pick up a copy it tight all in my grill crazy feelings and hot boys if your a fan likei am youll enjoy it as much as i did
4,Rockin' Beatz from VA,"There's some a few amazing tracks on this album, and a few weak ones. All the rest is pretty good. I think it's a bit better than Supa Fly - that one was half good, this one's two thirds good. Timbaland's production keeps things interesting. His solo album was weak but there's some wicked beats on this one.Stickin Chickens is my favorite track on this one. It's got everything - beats, voices and lyrics. She's A Bitch, Bus A Rhyme, Smooth Chick and All N My Grill (especially the MC Solaar version) are all wicked too."
1,Subhuman.,"""Beep Beep Who Got Da Keys To DA Jeep?"" If that's what passes for good poetry these days, standards have decreased. Missy Elliot has the brains of an Anthropoid. By the way: I hate ""beats."""
3,Not as tight as Supa Dupa Fly. Needs to grow on you.,"This CD isn't as tight as we're pumping it up to be. It's real bleak, and there's no Ginuwine or Magoo in the house to back it up. Plus, all the cuts are about stealing beats, getting guys to pay the bills, or being the queen ""B"". With the exception of Slim Shady catching wreck on the sick Timberland beat, and Redman representing to the fullest, this CD gets old real fast. Its not neccesarily Missy's fault; with such a tight production in 97, its easy to fall off with so much hype. My suggestion: get this album, and HOPE some of the songs grow on you. If you havent got the first one, this isn't the best place to start to here some of Missy's best work."
2,Save your loot people!!!,"This is album is not as tight as SupaFly. I have to admit that this was a let down. #3 & #15 are the best cuts on this album, the majority had to grow on me. Missy, you should have hooked up with Magoo a couple of times, you two rapping together-- (Magnificent). To be honest, Supa Fly was so tight, I expected you to only improve on this one, but your last album was pretty much at the top of the game. Big ups to Timbo on the beats, you are still holding it down. Where's Magoo?"
5,The album is blazzin'.,Missy is one the most powerful women in music today. That goes for all types of music. Some people criticize her for the language that she uses. People like that are just sraight up player haters. The album is bangin'. Missy is super talented. I'm looking forward to the next album.
3,"Good Cd, Short Shelf Life","When 'All in My Grill' came out, I knew I wanted to but this CD because I was hoping that the rest of the album would be as good as that song. And, for the most part, it was that good the first two or three times I listened to it. Many of the tracks are catchy and have good beats. However, after that, this album got old, REALLY old, and now it's tedious to listen to. It's too bad that such a talented artist like Missy couldn't create an album that had a longer shelf life."
3,Missy almost missed,she has about 4 tracks on here that are o.k to listen to she o.k but she no MC LYTE
2,The CURSING goes on forever.,"i loved missy's first album , and i thought she was great.in this album s missy failed to live up to her highest potential. As every minute passes the curses pour on and on and the other songs do not have,. a catchy tune as shes a B****. The curses you can eliminate by getting the edited album, but not the songs. This album was a dissapointment."
2,"Two hard hittin tunes, but too much of the same thing","She's a B#@$ and All in my Grill are the two songs that tricked me into buying this album, that and the fact that I was blown away by Missy's last album. But I think that it's time for Missy to do something new, because this sound is getting kinda old. I love Missy's voice and I wish that she would lean a bit more towards R&B."
2,Lusterless and Uninspiring,"The album didn't meet up to my expectations. I used to think that Missy's songs were synonymous with tight beats, sadly I was mistaken. The sounds on this album are dark and weak. Her repulsive rhyming ""style"" doesn't help matters either. The only good songs are ""She's A B*tch"" and ""Busa Rhyme"" --she's hardly even on that track, Slim does all the work while Missy mumbles inanely in the background. ""Da Real World"" is dull and uninspiring. It's also laughable that she says this album is the sound of the future (3000 to be exact). If this is the sound of the future then I don't want to be around to hear it. Not recommended."
4,The Queen is back,"Well, maybe not the Queen (Lauryn Hill still makes music) is back. Missy & Timbaland are the most creative force in Hip-Hop & R&B and no one can call challenge you on the mic, the switch over to a slow jam like Missy, and do it well. Although she's not as flashy as she used to be, the fun is still there. Good tracks are Beat Bitter, You Can't resist (Bumpin' with B.G. and Juve'), All in Grill, Hot Boyz. Only track I skip is Dangerous Mouths cause Redman is terrible except when he raps on his own stuff. Go figure."
5,"I love the song ""She's a Bitch""","I already love the cd. I haven't heard any other songs that ""She's a Bitch"" but I love that song. I think that it's going to be a good cd just by looking at the names of the tracks and the featured guests. I am definitely going to buy this cd the day that it comes out. Buy it when it's released if u like Missy."
3,Good but not great,"I give props to Missy for being original and innovative. But I just couldn't really get into this cd. ""All N My Grill"" is probably the best song on there. And Missy still doesn't know if she wants to be a rapper, singer or both. Plus the interludes with Lil Kim could've been left out."
5,Missy is unstoppable!!!!,"First off, to all the ones who hate it, ya'll actually need to congratulate it because Missy is one of the few wit' a banging style and tight beats that nobody can hang wit'(except for Timbaland of course!)! All her songs are hot especially ""You don't Know"" wit' Lil' Mo! Missy is one ""sista"" that rips it up and comes back wit' more! All her joints are tight and Don't wait, Buy da album now if you haven't on June 25,1999!! BABY!"
4,4.5 stars,"This album is almost flawless and in my eyes, it is a hip hop classic. It is Missy's best album, with Under Construction in a very close second place.Timbaland's production on here is untouchable, even to this day. Unlike almost every other rap song out there, these songs aren't just the same loop repeated over and over again... they have movements. They unravel as the song moves on. This album, which spans over an hour, does not get boring for even one moment. Since Missy hadn't fully developed her flow at this point, she smartly made the album half singing, half rapping. This also further sets it apart from any other rap release.This Missy Elliott album, although overlooked, is an essential recording. I would say that it paved the way for other artists... but no one has been able to touch the futuristic genius of Missy and Timbaland on this album. Ha!"
3,Talent -filled,"The Album is okay,especially the track ""All n my grill"" which is getting extensive airplay this side of the world.However-Do American rap stars have to swear so much in their songs? Isn't that a disincentive for some who would otherwise have bought the music? Say you what?"
2,Not Impressed,"I don't like this one she put out. Theres a few good tracks, (3-5) BTW The track list here is all uked up."
5,Excellent!,This is absolutely the best of her best. I'm only afraid I'll wear it out. For me her voice and style hit its zenith in the late sixites and seventies and these recordings are mostly from that time period. Nancy's voice is unmistakable and her talent immeasurable and it all comes out on these cd's.
5,Aptly Named,"I've always adored Nancy Wilson's work as a singer and actress. I remember going to see a Cuba Gooding Jr. movie and they advertised this box set by playing ""Save Your Love For Me"". Upon hearing that song, I made it my mission to own this, and I've been the proud owner of this box set since the year it came out. I haven't regretted since. This song, her version of ""Can I"", and countless others make any listener pleased."
5,NANCY AT HER BEST,"This album is yet another one of her great products. The smooth sound, gentle rhythms, and Nancy Wilson elegance shines through. I highly recommend this album for jazz enthusiasts and those who simply like music with a great sound."
5,Excellent description of coastal habitats & food chain,"Not a typical how-to-fish book although there is some advice on fly selection. Mostly deals with when and where to find fish in the various habitats which are described in detail (marsh, mangrove, surf, etc.) Essential reading if you want to understand the habits and food preferences of the coastal species you are targeting."
4,Blast from my past,A movie from the wayback machine. Enjoyed sharing it and it's stop motion animation with my kids. Some scary moments for the 5 and under set - but really great to talk about.
3,"Nice movie, slightly flawed disk.","This is a rather fun movie and is pure imagination. The acting isn't too over-the-top and is actually rather good in spots. The only problem I have is that there's a flaw in the disk early on that fortunately happens in a spot not too important to the movie, overall. When it comes up, I merely fast-forward till it's past, and I only lose about a minute and a half's worth of the picture, and while that is a bit annoying, it's not really that serious a problem. It's a nicely told story and the special effects are reasonably good. It's definitely worth getting, but I hope you don't get a flawed disk."
1,Re-worked musical version ruins this SINBAD clone,"After the successful release of Ray Harryhausen's special effects extravaganza 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD, producer Edward Small decided to clone the idea and hence JACK THE GIANT KILLER was born.This movie copied SINBAD's style in every particular, and the result was, while not nearly as polished as Harryhausen's film, entertaining in its own way. It was a major box office disappointment, however, and the studio decided to ""save"" the movie by RE-EDITING it and ADDING SEVERAL SONGS and a MUSICAL soundtrack. This essentially ruined the movie for all but the kiddies' market. Sadly for collectors, the musical version (recently aired on Disney Channel) is the one issued on this videotape. I'd hold out for the original if I were you."
4,Modern fantasy page turner,"Retelling of Jack story in a modern framework. Fun read, but more derivative and less fully developed characterization than in his later works.Still available as _Jack of Kinrowan_."
3,Fine First Half-Hour,"The first 30-minutes of ""Jack the Giant Killer"" are engaging, humorous, exciting, and romantic. Kerwin Matthews is charming as Jack and the special effects lend a story-book quality to the proceedings. I wish the story ended there. The remaining hour is okay, with lots of witchery and so-so special effects, and Torin Thatcher giving his ever-reliable turn as the villain, but it fails to capture the charm of the first half-hour."
3,Jack the Giant Killer DVD,"My son(13yrs) is an avid Ray Harryhousen fan and this movie was a must for his collection. While not one of the best RH movies, he still has enjoyed it."
3,...but the musical version gets 5 stars!,"This poor-man's ""Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"" is not without it's charm, but the bizarre musical version is the one to find! Sure it's a mess, but WHAT a mess! If you're a fan of strange live-action children's musicals like the K. Gordon Murray Mexican releases (""Santa Clause"", ""Little Red Riding Hood Meets The Monsters"", etc.) then you'll want to track down the musical version for this movie. Luckily I have my copy that I had taped from cable tv in the early 1980s."
2,Jack the Giant Killer (Kerwin Matthews),This should have been a better quality production - not sure why it failed to entertain...
3,Buy the Blu ray version,The quality of this dVd is not as strong as one might hope. The procedure requires MGM to acquire a film print of the movie in best condiiton and make a digital transfer. Copying all of the films defects. This film was quite clean with only a minor few scratches and dirt marks. MGM made no effort to color restore the print or the DVD copy. Adjusting my 55 inch screen color setting to full still produced a washed out image. Contrast brightness was high and made for too bright a picture image.Only one skipping point was noted in only one viewing test of the dvd.One note must be made to the effects work in this film which was not produced by the Lengenary Ray Harryhousen as people mistake.The monsters are a bit less detailed and not quite as fluid as the great master.yet this film is still a good fairy tale sure to please kids of all ages.
5,Jack the Giant Killer DVD,"A budget DVD released on Goodtimes homevideo (It used to be released on MGM). Picture quality of 'Jack the Giant Killer' is much better than the Vhs version (obviously) and about the same (if not better) than the Laser Disc release. This single layer disc runs 1 hour 36 minutes and is playable worldwide (NTSC). The movie stars Kerwin Williams & the beautiful Judi Meredith and directed by Nathan Juran. There are no special features on this DVD except for scene index and play. The DVD is worth it even at this price. This is not the musical version but the regular movie version, The disc is made in Hong Kong (and/or Taiwan) as mentioned on the back of the DVD keepcase, but then again most budget DVDs are made there nowadays. The picture and sound quality is very good (Its the best I've seen of this video so far) and would get this classic before its too late."
3,Generally sharp DVD,"The DVD is free of blemishes and is quite colorful; however, some images are pale, no doubt due to the aging of the original materials. This is especially apparent in composite shots where the models look bright but the backgrounds don't. Probably the best this film is going to look."
5,Killed that giant!!,Super reviews for both product and delivery!! Thanks for caring and packaging the DVD for travel!!
3,Non-musical,I had watched this movie with my sister more than 10 times 25 years ago and really enjoyed the musical bit.I was really excited to find out that there was still a copy left in HMV here in Hong Kong. I watched as soon as I got home but it just wasn't the same without the musical bit.Is there a musical version that has been released as well?
2,Wait a second!!! Are they serious???,"Bob Plant sounds like a neutered gibbon, and Jim Page's guitar moans like Nero's eunich ""wife."" Add these two to a dash of stoned Bela Lugosi and you get Led Zeppelin 4. The results are predictably disastrous, but they make anything by Pink Floyd sound like Beethoven's Fifth. As a result, they get 2 stars."
2,Worst Zeppelin album ever!,"How could people seriously think that this is Zeppelin's best work. This doesn't even compare to the work they did on Presence, or Coda. Hell, even In Through The Out Door was better than this. In fact, their first 4 albums are all kinda lame, and lack the intensity compared to their latter days. Stairway To Heaven is a ""ok"" song, so I'll give it two stars for that. But it certainly isn't worth 3 stars, let alone five."
2,"Led Zeppelin are pop, not rock","I cannot believe people saying that Led Zeppelin, and in particular this album, are ""rock n roll"". That's just not true-Led Zepplelin are really primarily a pop group.They don't have half the anger or ferocity of many other bands.""Black Dog"" and ""Rock n Roll"" sound so bland and stale that's it's laughable. And don't even bother listening to garbage like ""The Battle Of Evermore"" ""Going To California"" or ""Stairway To Heaven"", they would send you to sleep if they weren't so annoying."
1,Where's that counfounded....bridge,"Reading Stone Coldests desire for people to burn in hell etc. ,I've always been puzzled why Led Zeppelin fans are so touchy when it comes to criticism of their band. I asked my brother who studied psychology at university and he said that insecure peope like to ally themselves to ""big"" things, be it pop group, political causes etc. In essence by associating themselves with the ""big"" thing they're compensating for their own inadequacies. And criticism sparks off a ""guilt"" thing and they lash out.So the more rabid the fan the smaller the...well you get the hint."
5,Another album,"It is a pity that this album should have, and continue to receive so much attention. It stands on its own merit, a beautifully crafted collection of songs which gets mired in the overwhelming response it has gotten over multiple overplays and stigmatizing. I wish I had never heard of the band and of this album - then I would simply enjoy the album for what its really worth"
1,WHO ARE LED ZEPPELIN?????,"Someone said Zeppelin they are good, I brought this and oh my God it's awful. The singer don't know his name screams alot, and the words are disturbing, hey, hey mama? why does he want his mama? Is he a baby?Also how can you buy a stairway to Heaven, and bustle in your hedegow...huh? What's that nonesense all about???This isn't lyrics this is Noddy talk, now in my opinion the greatest rock band are Bon Jovi, they rock, Always is better than anything Led Zeppelin have done and they could only dream of doing an album as good as These Days and that's average on Bon Jovi standards.Also Going to California...BORING...give me Celine Dion any day...pleaseAlso what is Misty Hop about why can't he sing properly like that guy from Good Charlotte.Greatest worst ever rock album ever!!!!Don't buy this, buy Celine Dion instead!!!!P.SThe E stands for Expert"
1,MOST OVERRATED BANDS OF ALL TIME,"WOW!!!!! I can't believe a lot of people like LED ZEPPELIN so much. THEY JUST SCREAM. AND THIS IS PURE TRASH WITH NASTY SONGSLIKE BLACK DOG, AND MISTY MOUNTAIN. THIS ALBUM ONLY HAS 1 GOODSONG IN STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN. BUT REST OF LED ZEPPELIN(WITH THE EXCEPTION OF KASHMIR ON PHYSICAL GRAFFITI) IS TRASH!!!! BEATLESROLLING STONES, WHO AND ZEPPELIN ARE TRASH. GET ANYTHING FROMDIRE STRAITS INSTED WHO ARE REALLY TALENTED. DON'T RUIN MY NAME,EXPRESSO LOVE IS MY NAME FROM DIRE STRAITS' THIRD ALBUM MAKINGMOVIES. THAT IS BETTER, THIS IS TRASH.EXPRESSO LOVE."
1,Bad!!!! This Led Zeppelin's more appropriate 0 STARS,"Led Zeppelin are one of the worst bands besides THE BEATLES, AND THE ROLLING STONES. They have only made 1 decent song in KASHMIR.Rest of their other albums is junk!!! Besides this album has someof their worst songs in Black Dog, and Misty Mountain Hop. Andthe singer screams, is he on drugs??????? Anyway, don't listen to the 5 star reviewers, this album is worth ZERO. Get any albumfrom legends like DIRE STRAITS, GUNS N' ROSES, FOREIGNER, NIRVANA, AEROSMITH, and several other great bands.Better luck next time....Whirligig."
1,Blah!!! Led Zeppelin sucks.,"Blah!! Led Zeppelin are crappy, each and every song on this album is bad, even Stairway to Heaven. Avoid all the albums of this hugely overplayed and overrated band and get any album from Foreigner and Dire Straits as they are the master of love songs,period. Got that???? Then go with my advice."
1,This is rock? LOL!,"I can't believe you people think this is good music. Led Zeppelin were just a bunch of druggies who made music to get with groupies. All of their songs sound exactly the same, too. Try some REAL rock, like Limp Bizkit. They created hard rock!"
4,Let me say something.........,"...........This isn't the best Led Zeppelin album. But there's always this, Led Zeppelin is a legend of a band and they have some of the best cd's I've ever heard, and just because this one isn't good compared to their other one's doesn't mean it's bad. I mean, this was the cd to release ""Stairway To Heaven"", which is an amazing song. Also, ""When the Levee Breaks"" and ""Black Dog"". These guys are amazing. Great songwriting, great beats, and awesome guitar work, if your looking to improve your Led Zeppelin collection and you don't have this one, give it a try, and if your a beginner get this, and then get the others. They'll get better even though this one is a masterpiece itself. BUY IT!"
3,Good albun with materpieces in it,"Stairway and Misty are the greatest songs in the album, and Black + Battle + Rock'n'Roll a little below. I agree this is not Zeppelin's best album, but when I could play all Stairway (intro and solo included) I felt I were the happiest one in the universe. Also I really like drums in this album."
3,Zoso is so-so (not Peter Potomus' sidekick),"This album is very highly regarded by the Zepp-heads as one of thier best. I feel thier senior release is quite sophmoric. Except for the highly air-played 'Stairway' song, this album really doesn't break any musical ground. The obvious pursed lip playing of Page and the shrill and whiney Plant contributions are already old after three albums. However the thundering rhythm section of Bonham and Jones is eerily reminscent of Tyszkiewicz and Getz from Pocket Xplosion's first album 'noise'. The recordings are well done and they captured all the annoying nuances of Robert Plant's ego on this album. You can almost hear the not so signifigant bulge in his pants. A must have for anyone who needs an expensive coaster and an extra jewel case for an R.E.M cd."
1,Stay Away!,Stay away from this 'deal'. It is the original mastering from almost 20 years ago. The sound is terrible. No refunds either!
1,Led Zeppelin is over rated,"Some people say that led zeppelin changed the world of rock and they probably did. I just dont like them this album out of all of them was definatly not my favorite and I would rather listen to the first album but they are just sloppy and borring. It would maby be good If you were on pot or other drugs but i for one was not totaly blown away like others said they were. I still dont get the whole stairway to heaven thing i think people just say they like it just to be cool but it is a really boring, long, repetative, overrated song and i just cant stand it. Oh well my reveiw wont change anything that your thinking because you will get the album eventualy and either love it like most people or hate it like I did, so whatever."
1,"Well, it's useful for something at least.","I bought this album four months ago after repeatedly reading how utterly fantastic it was,how it was probably the greatest album ever. Today I use it as a coaster for cups of coffee."
1,Important question,"Led Zeppelin has always been one of the most overrated bands of all time, and this remains one of their most overrated albums. Buy it if you must, but first ask yourself one important question: Do you REALLY need to hear ""Stairway to Heaven"" yet again?"
5,ZOSO,recently collected Zeppelins 1st 3 albums and this was next in line. all originals and framed hanging on my wall
4,Not Their Best,"Despite what many people think, John Paul Jones plays the mandolin on this and every other Zeppelin album, not Jimmy Page. For example, from what I hear, there are are no overdubs in ""Battle of Evermore."" If there are, then they are guitar overdubs, not the mandolin. Jones is playing it, with Page on guitar, and Plant and Sandy Denny singing. The mandolin is a critical part of the recording and was needed for Plant and Denny to keep with the song."
3,Good but over-rated,"I never could understand why people think this is the best Led Zeppelin record ever. Now i think these guys are great, But come on this album is way over-rated.1. Black Dog 6/10: Ok2. Rock and Roll 8/10 Classic hardrock song3. Battle of Evermore 4/10: I could live with out it4. Stairway to Heaven 1/10: Way overated, Iron man by Black Sabbath was way better5. Misty Mountain Hop 9/10: This is ok, Rumors are that this is song makes fun of hippies.6. Four Sticks 6/10 SO-SO7. Going to California 9/10 Another song i like of this album8. When the Levee Breaks 7/10/ This is alrightYup there are better rock albums out there then this,Black Sabbath- ParanoidBlack Sabbath- Black SabbathLed Zeppelin- Led Zeppelin ICream- Wheel Of fireJimi Hendrix- Axis Of Love"
5,"A classic, everyone must own it, even those that would not describe themselves as Led Zep fans.","A classic, everyone must own it, even those that would not describe themselves as Led Zep fans.Nothing more to be said. You must own this CD.If you like the hard-rock, riff-driven songs on this CD, I recommend Led Zeppelin II - it contains Zep's best riffs."
5,Your life is not complete until you own this album.,"Eight songs, all classics. Hard rock, blues, folk and fantasy. Plenty of incredible moments - the screaming intro of Black Dog, the eerie opening of Stairway to Heaven, the thunderous druumming of When the Levee Breaks. This is the single best album ever recorded."
5,One of the greatest albums of all time!,"Led Zepplin IV is easily their best and one of my favorite CDs. There's some debate about which is better, this one or Led Zepplin II. Though ""Whole Lotta' Love"" is a premier heavy metal song, IV's ""Black Dog"", ""Rock and Roll"", ""When the Levee Breaks"", and even the mystically folksy ""The Battle of Evermore"" are all incredibly diverse and well-written songs. And of course ""Stairway to Heaven"", the most requested song on radio is amazing and worth the $15 alone. This would truly complete any rock collection, so buy it. It's the ultimate classic."
2,Overplayed and Overated!,"It is difficult to understand this Led Zeppelin phenomenon. I will admit that John Bonham was an excellent drummer and Jimmy Page does blend his guitar at times. However, lead screamer(eh.. singer), Robert Plant ruins many of the tracks(Misty Mountain Hop and Black Dog specifically) with his screetching caterwaling. In addition, the songs lack development. The great opening riff of Black Dog is wasted due to the lack of a good secondary melody. Four Sticks doesn't even have a memorable initial melody. Even Stairway To Heaven admist some creativity drags in a few spots. A nice song yes. A classic HELL NO! Going To California and Rock N Roll are my favorites on here. The Battle for Evermore and When The Levee Breaks are decent as well. However, no matter how I slice it, the rating is 2 1/2 stars."
5,In the Beginning God created Zeppelin,"Death's too good for anyone who doesn't like Zeppelin. Zeppelin totally kick @ss! If you buy this album you won't ever need another rock album ever, excpet for anything by Zeppelin. It's so good that you'll play it constantly for the rest of your life. I know I do. Don't buy anything buy other bands. Zeppelin are IT. Zeppelin are so superior to other bands it's scary. Combine all the talent in other bands and it still wouldn't be as much as in Jimmy Page's litte finger. The only other albums I listen to are Zeppelin, 1 Zeppelin 2,Zeppelin 3 and Physical Graffitti by Zeppelin."
4,Satisfied,I was satisfied with the condition and delivery time. The CD was in great shape and plays well with no problems.
4,Good album but...,"The Zepeteers who gave this album 5 stars really need to lighten up. Seriously, just because people don't like Led Zeppelin doesn't mean they deserve to ""Burn in hell"" or whatever crap you're telling them. As Jimi Hendrix once said, ""You've got your god and so do I"". Think of it like this, people could be doing much worse than disliking Led Zeppelin.Onto the music. I do not believe this is an essential recording (flame me if you wish, I've taken it before) merely because the four good songs (Black Dog, Rock 'n' Roll, Stairway to Heaven, When the Levee Breaks) can all be found on Early Days, along with some other good Zeppelin material. Misty Mountain Hop is decent, but I hope you like the keyboard riff because that's all you get. Sadly, the resident English Folke tunes are all lackluster. Battle of Evermore and Four Sticks both drag (the latter featuring some obnoxious singing) and Goin' to California is simply dull. II is better."
5,Led Zep IV - Fantastic!,"Another awesome album by Led Zeppelin, the band that led rock music out of the painful, pop oriented 1960s. Stairway, When the Levee Breaks, Going to California...the list goes on and on. Eight 5-star songs on one album! Very highly recommended!"
5,AWESOME SIMPLY AWESOME,"IF you like rock music than you have to own this music. No change that if you have any ability to hear buy this now. This is an incredible piece of music, and if you do not have it or have yet to experience it I am jealous, because I wish I could go back and here this for the first time. This album does not have a bad tune on it. Sure some of the songs on it are played to death on the radio, but that is because the songs are timeless. Try playing the Battle of Evermore on your guitar and you can appreciate Jimmy Page's mastering of the instrument. Simply put this album is one fo the best peices of music ever put on record, disc, tape, etc.......BUY IT NOW"
5,Cool,"Classic album. It has some of my all time favorites. It's up there with other all time rock masterpieces such as Gish (Smashing Pumpkins), Siamese Dream (Smashing Pumpkins), Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (Smashing Pumpkins), Adore (Smashing Pumpkins), Rage Against the Machine (self-titled), Ten (Pearl Jam), Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd), and some Cream/Beatles/Rolling Stones/Guns 'N Roses"
5,SIMPLY AMAZING!,"The second greatest album of all-time is IV. It emcompasses all the elements needed for a classic album. And have ""Stairway to Heaven"" sure doesn't hurt this album!"
5,What else can you say?,"This is like ""Sgt. Pepper"", ""Highway 61"", ""Dark Side"", ""Exile On Main Street"", or ""Never Mind The Bollocks"". If you know about it, you've already formed your own opinion, and there's nothing new I can add to the discussion. If you don't know what's going on here (i.e. if your from a distant planet), then it is your duty to buy this and marvel in some of the best music of the (20th) century. Hard to believe its almost 30 years old."
5,The best ever,"This is the best cd ever made. There is no question about it, this is it. If you do not get it, you are depriving yourself of something that only comes around once a lifetime"
3,1994 vs 2003,"If your looking for a better sounding remaster from the 2003 cd and already own the 1994 version, keep the 1994 version. There is little, if any, difference between the two. If you want the cool mini-lp packaging, get it, it's a real nice collectible."
2,Don't believe the hype,"I had to write in after reading the review"" the greatest album of album of all time"" where the reviewer says that ""there has never been anything approaching Led Zeppelin IV."" I hate to tell you this people, but I, and everyone else I know who has heard it think it's one of the most overrated albums of all time,only matched by Pink Floyd's The Wall.Led Zeppelin did a couple of good songs but they certainly don't deserve the massive popularity they have-and most people I know feel the same way."
1,Pest Control,"Do you have pest control problems? Do you have problems with mice, ants, or this album? Then call 866-802-PEST for a free consultation. You will be pest-free in no time!"
1,this the most overated album in history!!!!!!,"Why does everybody treat this album like the best invention since Hindenburg? Honestly, I can not express how pure annoyance it is to hear all of the songs from this album played like a gazillon-bajillion times a day. This album took alot of credit away from other great bands of that era, and gave the mindset to rock fans that all Led Zeppelin music was fast-paced blues. This album made me think that all Led Zeppelin albums sounded this crappy, but they are sooooo much better. I hate this album because it makes Zeppelins other albums look like nothing and Led Zeppelin IV gets all the credit!!! If I didn't hear Led Zeppelin II, I would still be hating Led Zeppelin. This is definately the sellout album.P.S.:I know I originally wrote a review slandering Led Zeppelin as a band and all their other albums, but after hearing Led Zeppelin again and Led Zeppelin II, I've had a change of heart, so listen to this review and not the last one."
2,People need to quit jerking off to this.,"We get it. Led Zeppelin was a great band, possibly the greatest of their time. But f**king get over it. I'm so tired of people who think they are metalheads, yet all they listen to is AC DC, Led Zeppelin, and Metallica. THERE IS OTHER MUSIC OUT THERE. Quit clinging to the past and branch out a bit! Extend your musical horizons! For the love of GOD!"
1,Chutzpah-leeze!,"In what may be the most elaborate and deliberate display of sonic self-diddling caught on wax, these arena rock harlots stroke their tools for 42 and a half minutes and, in perhaps what stands as the most compelling argument against doing very much acid, fans would literally lose all control of their bodily functions after Robert Plant rained down nipple sweat on their slithery, barnacled tongues. This frothy prattle is for jerkwads who pepper everyday conversations with Pippi Longstocking and J.R.R. Tolkien references. Jimmy Page's approach to the guitar is akin to a suburban dad trying to crank up a flooded weedwacker. Like he's running a slave labor factory somewhere in Malaysia, brought to you by Budweiser. Take it or leave it, I'll ... OK, I'll just leave it."
2,Adequate,"Rock n' Roll, Stairway, When the Levee Breaks. That's it. Three good songs out of only eight on the album. The lead on Rock n' Roll is great, but most second year guitar students can bang it out.This album is adequate. It brings back good memories. But so do hundreds of others.Buy the Led Zep Early Days and Latter Days series and you get all three good songs on this album, plus the rest of what you need from this group.Three songs out of eight equals 2 stars."
1,mindnumbingly overrated garbage,"So, you've heard people rave about Led Zeppelin and you want to see if they really are that good?READ THIS CAREFULLY- I first bought an album of thiers back in 1987,listened to it,borrowed all the rest of their albums,and listened to them many times again.Since then I've put on their records from time to time and you know what? I STILL CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE SEE IN THEM.They are one of the biggest scams in music history."
1,This is amazing.,"...This CD is completely amazing. Any one who criticizes this album is not a fan of Rock. Personaly, I have spent most of my adult life researching pretty much every Rock band that has made any success at all.(It is my job) I have come to a conclusion that Led Zeppelin is most impressing band there is. To many, Jimmy page is the best guitarist ever. That can be debated. The same issue can be considered about John Bonham. Robert Plant has an extremely attractive voice. He has very impressive variety, and sounds excellent. Jihn Paul Jones allows Led Zeppelin to be such an amazing band and still have only 4 members. I think that it is a complete miracle of life that these 4 people of different talent found each other. This album is a result insane talent. There is no better explanation. I also suggest buying the new DvD and CD. It will take breath from you."
4,happy music,"This is a very good album. I purchased the Complete Studio Recordings and it blew me away. My top Zep albums are Houses Of The Holy and Physical Grafitti, with this not far behind. It's a pleasure to hear four musicians perform great music very well."
5,It's been a long time.,That people are still talking about this album thirty years after the fact (and that some people also take the time to dis it) shows that Led Zeppelin has left a legacy on par with the Stones AND the Beatles.
4,"A softer classic, but hard as lead too","The Runes album is known for ""Stairway to Heaven,"" with ""Black Dog"" and ""Rock & Roll"" being the other most noteworthy inclusions. ""Black Dog"" has a striking, tho repetitive, Jimmy Page riff, an authentic rock and roll signature. ""Rock & Roll"" is one of the essential numbers of a band known for its ability to churn out raw power, what a bassline! But while the album is fine as a whole, it is carried by ""Stairway,"" certainly one of the all-time classics, tho I put it on less of a pedestal than most people do. The group explores beauty over blast in this tune (until the very end) and very nicely, and Robert Plant's singing is top notch. ""The Battle of Evermore"" and ""Misty Mountain Hop"" have some moments, but overall, I rate Zep II better because of its consistency."
1,WHAT THE....,"A .. .A.. AD.AJDADJ..F...... THEY WERE MUCH BETTER ON MASTER OF PUPPET..S........I AM ON FIRE RIGHT NOW, PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AT THE TONE:DOODDOODHELLO MAMA MAY I SHAKE YOUR THANG GONNA MAKE YOU FERN GONNA MAKE YOU STINK!!!ALFAJSDLFJASLDFJASFL;DKJF......YEAH SIMPLE PLAN,,, YOU JUST KEEP BEING STUOOOPID!!!"
1,Why are they so overrated????????????????,"Led Zeppelin were simply the most overrated band of all time who were just as bad as NIRVANA and ACDC. They only made about a decent song in ""Stairway To Heaven"". Rest of the songs just STINK!!! Plant sounds more like a big monkey than a real singer and can't sing at all, HE JUST SCREAMS. Like good singers??????? I recommend go with Foreigner, Dire Straits who were equally the greatest bands with the greatest singers in LOU GRAMM, and MARK KNOPFLER. They are a billion times better than LED ZEPPELIN. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this page, avoid this piece of junk and go with Foreigner insted. They are legends, not ZEPPELIN!!!"
1,Dinosuars,"Thank you Led Zep! You, this album, and the bloated ""Stairway to Heaven"" created the pompous arrogance that gave punk something to rebel against. As a result we got great bands like The Clash who, musically speaking, left your flatulent dinosaur in the dust."
1,Yawn,"Snore snore. Led Zep has got to be one of the most boring bands in rock history, and ""Stairway to Heaven"" is a really bad song. What is all the fuss about?"
1,How did this Crap get popular,when i heard this band in their early days i could just not understand why they stayed together after hearing them once i thought they should give up. I Hope the kids of tomarrow dont get into this poo it cant get anyone anywhere it just cant compare to some of the music today this band will just be forgotten and people will just drop all their LED Zeplin Records in the can and will be history
1,Zeppelin's finest,"How ironic that one of the all time greatest rock album's of all time should go untitled. However it is indeed hard to find words adequate enough to praise this cd. It could be considered almost a greatest hits album in itself. As varied as the tracks are they are all increidible songs. While some of the tracks are vintage heavy metal, that assault the ears with fantastic and powerful rythms. But at the same time delicate songs such as stairway to heaven, and going to california, however one thing remains common throughout the all the songs. The musianship and vocals are superb on all the tracks. If you are looking to purchase a first led zeppelin cd, or looking to recommend one to a newcomer make it this one."
1,Are you...,"Ok first off I'm not a Zeppelin hater, Zeppelin 2 is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I think everyone should own it. I also love the work they did after this album with Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti. But this album is so bad it makes me sick. The people who wrote these reviews giving this album 5 stars are either... or totally consumed with the image brought on by the name of the band. Not everything this band recorded was good, no matter what their millions of worshipers say. And nothing proves that point more than listening to this album. So if you're looking for a Zeppelin album I suggest buying either Houses of the Holy or Led Zeppelin 2. But no matter what you do leave this piece of trash on the shelf because trust me you will be disappointed."
5,No Title Necessary,"I really don't think it's possible to purchase this album and not think that it was worth the money after one serious listen. This album is good the first time, and every time. There's nothing else that sounds like this out there.""Black Dog"" is just great classic Led Zeppelin, and a great opening. ""Rock and Roll"" will rock your pants off. ""The Battle of Evermore"" is jaw droppingly good. It's a folk song about a battle from Tolkein's epic ""Lord of the Rings."" Truly incredible. ""Stairway to Heaven."" ""Misty Mountain Hop"" is a really great playful song. ""Four Sticks"" has a great rhythm that is addictive. ""When the Levee Breaks"" will blow you away.""Stairway to Heaven"" is really good, but it doesn't dominate this album. The other songs are also really good, and you forget about ""Stairway"" easily. I'd have to say that this is LZ's best album, but it's a really close call, and honestly, they're all really good, and generate different moods."
2,Nothing great,"Led Zeppelins actual talent and innovativeness are often very much exaggerated. This album despite it's ""awesome"" reputation is nothing special."
2,Intelligent people can trash it too,"I have a University degree too, and although I don't believe that only misfit drug addicts listen to Zeppelin, I have to say that the popularity of this album has always mystified me."
4,More Jimmy Page Myths and Lies,"Page DID NOT play on the Kink's ""You Really Got Me"". He wasn't in the room, he wasn't in the same town as the Kinks. He didn't get involved in working with them until 2 weeks after the song was done.If Page did 1/10 of what people claim for him, he might actually be a genius rather than a petty liar and outright thief."
5,Best Album Ever. Bar None.,"This is it. The greatest band ever, IMHO, taking bigger strides in rock and roll than any other (besides maybe the Beatles), creating modern rock as we know it, is called Led Zeppelin, and their best album is Led Zeppelin IV (or Zoso, Rune, Untitled, or whatever). There are 8 songs, and I would buy a CD with pure crap just to get a chance to hear one of these. Black Dog and Rock and Roll are classic rock songs. Battle of Evermore and Going to California are nice softer tunes. Four Sticks is awesome. Misty Mountain Hop rules. When the Levy Breaks has one of the coolest guitar solos ever, and Stairway to Heaven... my second favorite song ever (second only to Beethoven's 9th, heh). This album is worth anything you must pay. Get it new, not used. Get it remastered. Please... you'll never regret it."
1,Not the remastered version,"I wish to repeat what another review stated which unfortunately I didnt read, this seems to be an import and not the remastered version which is why it is so cheap."
2,What?,"I like Led Zeppelin ok but this album sucks!! Why do people thinkthis is the greatest album of all time! People so much like thisband, Beatles, and the Stones. They are too overated. The onlygood songs on this cd is Rock and Roll, and Stairway to Heaven.Black Dog is one of the most annoying songs ever!! This is definately not the best album ever! Want some better rock and roll? Pick up Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction, and DireStraits' Love over Gold.I hate this.buy those 2 insted."
2,Worst song ever,"This album would have been alright had it not been destroyed by the truly woeful Stairway to Heaven. It truly is the worst song ever recorded - a tuneless dirge full of trite, banal lyrics. It is a waste of vinyl. The only good thing about shelling out money for the CD is that you can program the player to omit the song and only play the other songs which are passable - nothing special. Best song is Rock and Roll."
2,OVERRATED,"What's the big deal? Where are the melodies, the harmonies, the hooks?Want a real album? Put down your joint and by ""Revolver"" by the Beatles."
2,Is it just me?,That does it. Tomorow I'm going to form a support group for people like myself who can't understand what people see in this band.
2,Gods of Rock ? I don't think so !,"Withe the release of Led Zepelin IV the mighty Zep grew into this so called ""Gods of Rock"" legend.This is the only CD by Zep I have ever owned or will own.Anything else by this band is a waste of money. I prefer to listen to Robert Plant solo. Jimmy Page is a highly overrated guitarist and has very little technical talent at all and many other guitarists blow him away.Buy this cd and save your money on the rest of the Zep CDS ."
3,Stairway to Cheeseland,"Nah, I don't buy all the hype about this album. Yeah, Black Dog is a great song. Rock and Roll is, well, very noisy, straight rock and roll (and it works selling Cadillacs too!). Stariway to Heaven is a cheeeeeeeesy thang which never fails to impress the semi-deaf three-chord bunch, although doesn't make a dent on any minimally trained ear. As for the musicians, Page is a good player but in this album he began yielding to overdub temptation (that's why his live playing sounds so lame). Bonzo hits the drums as hard as he always did, which is pretty much all he ever did (I don't care if he revolves in his grave or not). Plant did all of his tricks in Zepp I already -and he repeated them to exhaustion in all of the other albums.Overall, this is not a crappy album, but calling it ""the crowning achievement of r'n'r"" is a very long shot."
5,stairway......is......godly,"Yes there is not one bad song on this cd. Yes the first 2 are classic rock anthems which can now be heard in car commercials. Yes the last track is a kick-butt rockin' bluesy display of guitar playing. However all of the other 7 tracks seem superfluous, even unnecessary to the band's greatest song: Stairway to Heaven. Almost like Ravel's 17 minute Crescendo ""Bolero,"" Stairway builds from a few simple notes (possibly the most famous intro in Rock) to the jam of the century at the end. Buy the album. For stairway. But not just for stairway. Just buy it."
4,close to perfection,"I think this album is a great continuence to the three before it. In my oppinion it is not their greatest, but lets put it this way, if I were stranded on an island with a batery powered tape player, it would be among my top five albums. I like the layout of songs in this album. I don't think you could start with a better song than ""Black Dog"", nor end with a better song than ""Stairway to Heaven"".If you love Led Zepplin, or you love music, this a great album to have."
2,MP3 Album NOT The Remastered Version!,"Beware that the MP3 album for sale here is NOT the remastered version, even though it's linked to the remastered CD version on the amazon site. I discovered this after purchasing and listening to it. The audio is muddy and full of dropouts, and basically sounds like an old audio cassette. This is why it's only $8."
5,Led Zeppelin - Another Great One,"The album that contains what many believe to be the greatest rock n roll song of all time ""Stairway To Heaven"", ""IV"" is another classic Zeppelin disc that is absolutely solid from start to finish. This album was where Zeppelin graduated from the biggest rock band in the world to true rock gods. There is not a bad song on the disc, and not a single track that has not received at least some radio airplay over the years. ""Black Dog"", ""Rock And Roll"", ""Battle Of Evermore"", ""Stairway"", ""Misty Mountain Hop"", ""Four Sticks"", ""Going To California"", ""When The Levee Breaks"", man they are all great. Even though I have heard ""Stairway To Heaven"" a million times over the years, I still find myself banging my head to Page's guitar solo in the big finale. Yes, it deserves to be one of the most celebrated rock songs of all time. 70's rock did not get much better than this, and many of these tracks are still relevant today."
5,By far the best LZ album,"This album, Led Zeppelin IV/Zoso, is an amazing piece of classic/hard rock. This is my song by song rating:Black Dog 5/5--A bluesy rocker that's a great opener.Rock and Roll 3.5/5--The most straightforward LZ song I've heard. IMO it's nothing special.The Battle of Evermore 4/5--An OK song. Very folksy.Stairway to Heaven 5/5--One of the best rock songs in history, period.Misty Mountain Hop 4.5/5--A pretty darn cool song. Great guitar riff from Jimmy Page. The only downfall is that's it's fairly repetitive.Four Sticks ?/5--Don't listen to this song that much.Going to California 4/5--A beautiful acoustic ballad.When the Levee Breaks 5/5--My favorite LZ track of all time. Driving drums from John Bonham; great guitar from Page.Led Zeppelin IV/Zoso is, or should I say, has, become a classic that will be listened to by many generations of rock music lovers for a long, long time."
4,|4.2| Stairway to heaven indeed...,"IV is certainly not the best Zep album in my opinion, although it is certainly conisidered that by many people. In any case, this is Led Zeppelin, and whats more to say? I am sure you have at least heard of the song ""Stairway to Heaven"", which is one of their catchiest and best songs ever in my opinion. I did not find the rest of the album as enjoyable as their previous work, but there is still no denying the great feeling I still get when I listen to Zep. Listening to them just makes you ask the question: ""what the hell has happened to rock these days?"" If you have somehow not heard Led Zeppelin before, well now is a good time to start. An obvious big thumbs up.Best tracks: ""Stairway to Heaven"", ""Black Dog"", and ""Rock and Roll""."
5,the only perfect CD in my collection,This is one of the greatest albums ever made and every song is excellent. If you don't like 'Stairway to Heaven' there's something wrong with you. 'Misty Mountain Hop' and 'The Battle of Evermore' are epic tracks as well. I could not overstress how good this CD is. Buy it.
5,Stairway to Heaven - Favorite after 30 years!,"OMG, did I just write 30 years? Well, it's true! I've been listening and loving this album, 8-Track, now CD since the 70's in high school, and I've never gotten tired of this song, or this CD.This is such a classic. If you want to ""Get the Led Out"" this is the CD to buy! Totally AWESOME!"
3,Basic Zeppelin,"Okay, it's just the way I remembered it from high school. The problem is not the music, it's the recording. Very shallow, and sharp. This could have been make much more listener friendly."
2,really overated!!,"I always loved Led zeppelin, but when I heard Deep purple's Machine Head, I lost my interest in Jimmy Page's playing and his band..If you want a GOOD Zep album, buy their second one, but if you're a looking for a REAL classic.. try Deep Purple's Machine Head, In Rock and Burn, Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, or Black Sabbath's Paranoid or Heaven and Hell"
4,I guess I'll change my mind.,"Actully as Led Zeppelin made about 2 or 3 decent songs they aren't that bad. And I love Stairway to Heaven as it is. I'll give a it a 4 because it's great when your feeling low just likethese songs,Guns and Roses November Rain,Foreigner Waiting For A Girl Like You,Beatles Hey Jude.And remember as I agree with that reviewer, Green Day are horrible."
4,A Fine Addition to Any Rock Collection,"Led Zeppelin IV can be described as a powerful force involved in the beginning of rock. From the first track to the last, Led Zeppelin IV rocks on with a great singer, Robert Plant, and an amazing guitarist, Jimmy Page. If you like Jimmy Hendrix or Black Sabbath you'll love Led Zeppelin IV."
4,An Awsom band,"1st i want to say Led Zeppelin Is one of the greatest bands of all time. This album is great, i personally like stairway to heaven and black dog best but theres a little problem, i recently looked on this website and it said if you play one part of Stairway To Heaven which starts out as...""if theres a burssle in ur head, dont be alarmed now""......theres evidence of satanic lyrics. I didnt belive it being such big Zeppelin fan. But WHen i tried it out for myself, there are satanic lyrics that are a little disturbing. And if you try it out go ahead, but if it will change your beiews on led zeppelin i wouldnt reccomend it. But I am Still a Hardcore Zepplin fan...nothing has changed. So buy this album."
4,classic,"like many people growing up in the '90s i knew who led zeppelin was and at the same time i didnt. led zeppelin is america's rock band and the only song ive ever heard was stairway to heaven its the only song guitarists talk about when they start out. except for the name and the naked angel i didnt know a thing about them. until all my drummer friends wouldnt shut up about john bonham. so i decided to get the album to listen to everything. From what i can decipher led zeppelin is a very good ensemble band. what i mean by that is that a lot of bands now such as tool, dream theater are bands who masster the complexities of their instruments and led zeppelin was ahead of their times by doing that. anybody can plainly see that jimmy paige is a solo god and no one can match robert plant's screaming and john bonham is very impressive (black dog). and this album is the album which is the most mainstream they get. i think everything comes together in perfect harmony and they live up to their name"
1,Yes it really is the most overrated album of all time.,"...Anyway I've always found this album to be an album of extremes. It can be extremely boring sometimes and it can also be extremely annoying. You can't honestly like Robert Plants voice! Nobody can master the ... whine like he can. Listen to him sing ""It's just a spring clean for the May Queen"" or ""you're head is humming"" Hoo boy.....not good...."
1,The most overrated album of all time.,"This mostly ridiculous and overblown record marks the end of Led Zeppelin's usefulness. With only a few worthwhile exceptions, the tracks on this album represent the musicians attempting a level of art they weren't capable of reaching, and the results are spectacularly crass and mindless. Yet, had the album been full of black dogs and rock and rolls, it would never have been able to offer all the public-friendly tripe that made it such a hit machine."
1,Ludicrously overrated hippy garbage,"I've read some reviews here where the reviewer claimed that Beatles and Stones fans trash this album because they are jealous. That's simply not true, since if they were jealous of it that would mean that they like it. No, the real reason why Beatles and Stones fans trash this album is because it's simply not very good."
1,Ho Hum,"The only remotely redeeming feature of this album is the presence of the great Sandy Denny on backing vocals on ""The Battle For Evermore."" But why blow your money on this, when there are many albums where you can hear her without all of Robert Plant's ear shattering screeches?"
1,THIS IS THE BIGGEST PILE OF TRASH I HAVE EVER HEARD,"""The Greatest Album Of All Time""?? Huh??? When The Levee breaks is the only decent song on this album and it's not even their song! Black Dogs riff sounds like a collection of random notes compiled by a compuer program. Battle Of Evermore is unbeleivably irritating and the vocals are frequently discordant.(A fault with many of the songs here) Misty Mountain Hop has a ""riff"" which sounds like something my five year old could have thought up given a minutes thought. Four Sticks is an awkward mess featuring Page at his sloppiest.I was sceptical of the negative reviews of this album but after listening to this garbage I have to agree with them . Save your money people, this album stinks."
1,!tihs fo elip gnimaets a si mubla sihT,Yes I know some people gave this album five stars but I've seen some five star reviews for the movie Howard The Duck here. I urge everyone not to believe people saying how great this album is. I think it's AWFUL. When I first heard it in 1986 I thought it was awful and fifteen years later I still do. Buy something else.
4,"Really artistic on their part, diffrent styles of music","Led Zeppelin 4 has to be their best album of all time. Their unique style blended in with aswome gutair playing by Jimmmy Page, vocals by Robert Plant,the bass by John Paul Jones, and one of the greatest drumer (in my opinion) the late John Bonahm.... when all combined they made a awsome cd and their music willl live forever."
5,"This cd is great, the best songs on one album!",this cd is the first led zeppelin i bought and it is great! stairway which was a smash is what this cd is known for as well as it has no title except for the four symbols. Tis a great cd which every Zep fan should own!
1,Led Zapplin=Satanic?!?!?!?,"yes ladies and gentleman i know its hard to believe but in led zapplins song ""stairway to heaven"" if you play it backwards there is a satanic message.....i can give you proof...but first i want to say is in the song ""stairway to heaven"" if you listen to the phrase backwards there is a message....song played forward-""if theres a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now. its just a spring clean for the May queen. Yes there are two paths you can go by,But in the long run. there's still time to change the road your on""song played backward-""oh heres to my sweet satan. the one whose little path would make me sad, whose power is satan. He'll give those with him 666,there was a little toolshed where he made us suffer, sad satan""[...]believe me?"
1,Ick.,"This CD is whack. It sounds like old peoples music. Its really old too, like over 30 years old. The sound isn't real good and the style of music on the CD is way out of style."
1,led zeppelin sucks,"Led zeppelin iv is one of the most overrated albums of all time. They only made 3 decent songs in 'Stairway to heaven', 'kashmir',and rock and roll. But the rest of them, no no because I hear them all the time on the radio. Stay away from most of the overrated led zeppelin albums and any album from the rolling stones and bads who suck. and one more thing, I'm glad theyaren't around anymore.hahahahahahahhahahah!!!!!!"
1,What this is??,"Man I work with recommend this CD. Why such noise? And old noise too, from 60's. No such thing as stairway to heaven either. Not understanding why people like this music. Woman who sing the song sound like she is feeling in pain. She yell and scream. Not good."
4,lots of fun,"This is a really good rock album. Jimmy Page's solo on Black Dog is my highlight, actually that song is what got me into Led Zep. Rock in Roll , and when the levee breaks rock. misty mountain hop and four sticks are enjoyable, the acoustic stuff is enjoyable enough without being brilliant. Stairway has its moments too! It's a very good album with great performances Thank you"
5,Best Rock'n'roll Album,"Led Zeppelin's, ""Led Zeppelin IV"" is spectacular. It provides the audience some Hard Rock style, such as ""Black Dog"", ""Rock And Roll"", and some others, following ""The Battle Of Evermore"" which is a type of creative style. Jimmy Page and his band have done an awesome job of duo's that, then connect songs. This band has taken all their songs to a different level, and created their best album, ""Led Zeppelin IV"". This is absolutely worth listening to, the bands duo's, guitar-playing, and singing."
5,Classic,"I think this is the best rock album of all-time, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, all of it. It came out in 1971 and still has the best guitar solos and catchiest songs you'll hear. Page has to be one of the best guitarists ever, up there with Santana, Clapton, Hendrix, Van Halen, etc. This album, Led Zeppelin's fourth installment, is my favorite album of the bunch, fueled by the great rock tunes of Rock and Roll, Black Dog, and Four Sticks, and the epic songs of When the Levee Breaks and Stairway to Heaven. Stairway to Heaven alone, spanning 8:03, by itself makes the album classic and worth buying. However, all of the songs on this are classic, and have obviously lasted the test of time. I'm more of a rap fan than rock, honestly, but I love classic rock now because I heard this album. Can't possibly recommend it any higher-BUY IT NOW"
5,People Giving Low Scores to Masterpieces,"...The inclusion of stairway to heaven alone leaves this album at perfection. Since that song is one of the greatest ever written. But then throw in something like black dog, with an amazing guitar line by Page. More amazingly, is that anyone who thinks Plants vocals aren't up to par, SHOULD NOT BE LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM. His vocals are amazing for rock n roll and Led Zeppelin is by far in no way, shape or form, underrated. Go buy this album and listen to one of the best bands in rock n roll history. Finally, there comes a point where ignorance is shown in some of these reviews, take the majorities word on it."
5,A True Classic...It Stands the Test of Time,"Led Zeppelin turned this album into a epic that has and will always stand the test of time. Every single song on this album is definitly one of true meaning to Led Zeppelin ""heavy and very musical"". No collection is complete without this album...period."
5,BRILLIANT MASTERPIECE,"First off, what the hell is wrong with the reviews posted by ""Jimmy Jim Jim"" and ""A Music Fan."" True, Zeppelin IV is a bit overrated, but how could you EVER say that Slipknot or ""Modern Day"" Metallica is better than Zeppelin??!!!!Even though Zeppelin IV is overrated (Houses of the Holy is my favorite), it still gets 5 Stars because it puts so many other albums to shame. Just remember, Zeppelin could make a horrible album, and it would still be better than the majority of modern day bands' best albums."
5,ur a retart mister satanic freak,who cares if it is satanic backwards it is still the best song ever. led zeppelin is better than any crap u listen to like good charlette and green day so go blow urself u retartled zeppelin rocks!!!!
5,"One of the ""Essentials"".","If you are getting into progressive rock, hard rock, oldies or whatever it's called in 2005...get this one. It is essential.Also check out the 1st and Physical Graffiti as excellent blues based progressive rock music. But ZOSO is essential."
2,"Some good things, but zep is shallow","This band is one of the richest and most popular in history, It is also the most pretentious overrated shallow music you'll ever here, except the boy bands. If you want real British rockers try Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones(a bit overrated) And of course, the awesome Beatles and the Who as well. Floyd's lyrics and guitar are so much better than zep. However, for simply the best music of all time and the deepest lyrics try The Doors! Morrison will come back from the grave and destroy Page. If you want to argue about it, you can email me at zeusfans@aol.com"
3,Black Dog Baby!!!,"Black Dog is the best song on this album, it has awesome guitar riffs all the way through! Stairway to Heaven maybe be a hit, but I dont like the slow songs on this album. You cant resist tapping your foot, and bobbing your head to Black Dog! It makes you groove! I'm a real big fan of 70's rockers, and these guys are good. This is my first Led album. However, If you are buying a Led Zeppelin CD for the first time, make sure you know if you like the songs! I was a little dissapointed with the rest of the cd(besides Black Dog), but it still rocks! I give this baby a 3!"
2,What?,"I like Led Zeppelin ok but this album sucks!! Why do people thinkthis is the greatest album of all time? People so much likethis band, Beatles, and the Stones. They are too overrated. Theonly good songs on this CD is Rock and Roll, and Stairway to Heaven. Black Dog is one of the most annoying songs ever! This is definately not the best album ever! Wantsome better rock and roll? Pick up Guns N' Roses' Appetite forDestruction, and Dire Straits' Love over Gold.I hate thisbuy those 2 insted."
2,Zoso = So So,"I got this for my birthday from an aunt. The drummer is alright. Robert Plant sounds like Christina Aguilera sometimes. Jimmy Page's solos are okay, but he's no Avril Lavigne - now there's some solos! It's not heavy metal, but if you like chunky-sounding 70's rock, its ok."
3,Overrated!,"Many people give this album five stars. Because they love Led Zeppelin and their music but for me I am no Zeppelin fan and not going to be one. Sure this album has it's moments, but I've listened to a lot better disc than this. The melodies are all scrambled together and yet while it's heavy and well played it also gets a bit annoying not just Robert Plant's voice but it sounds so dated.Many people disagree with me but I have listened to 3 other Zeppelin albums and they're all allright. they are however far from being masterpiece including this album.I Don't Hate Zeppelin I'm not feeling them."
4,"OVERRATED OKAY, BUT SOUND HONEST AND TRUE","A lot's of people say that LED-ZEPPELIN IV IS OVERRATED,well could be. But this band have always played and recorded what they had in mind,and they were not afraid of the final result. Instead of hiring a producer to produce a commercial sound like most of the band of the 80's and the 90's did, Led-Zeppelin did their albums the way the were feelin at the moment. Oh, by the way this album is 18 times platinum, not bad for a band overrated. Anyway, for myself this album is not Led-Zeppelin at their peak, but close."
4,Not bad at all,"Its hard to say: I'm not a traditional led Zep fan like the rest of the reviews: which is to say that I apreciate different things than most of the above people. I definetely have to agree wtih Awestere@aol.com when he mentions some of the more fogettable tracks. Simply said, Stairway, Evermore, California, and to a certain degree, Levee make this CD worth buying. The rest of the songs could use a little work. But hey, 50% of the tracks are of better quality than most bands ever churn out!"
5,Zep 4 is just about perfect!,"Some of the greatest hard songs ever:MISTY MOUNTAIN HOPBLACK DOGROCK & ROLLOne of the most beautiful folk songs ever:GOING TO CALIFORNIAThree songs that have different sounds and beats that take a while to get into. But when it they sink in the soul, they are as good as the rest:BATTLE OF EVERMOREFOUR STICKSWHEN THE LEVEE BREAKSLast but not least:STAIRWAY TO HEAVENStairway brought all styles together into one majestic epic song.ZOSO IS AS GOOD AS ANY ALBUM EVER!!!But I have to say that Physical Graffitti is my personal favorite."
5,Led Zeppelin IV,"I am from the era when rocked ruled. This is one great music group, they really know how to rock."
5,HA HA HA,THIS limp bizkit fan is funny I was just reading some of his other reviews and he happened to review the NIRVANA best of album he reckons they copied Puddle of Mud. But how can you copy someone if you're music is 10 years older than theirs HA HA.BY the way this Album is very important for rock very few other albums can be mentioned in the same breath
5,Led Zeppelin IV,"All right. I read this review that said that Led Zeppelin sucked and that -get this- Avril Lavigne was better. For the love of god, some people have no brains at all. It's one thing to not like Led Zeppelin, but to say that they suck and that other greats like Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen suck, well that's just plain stupidity. And who told you that Jimmy Page was a computer?"
5,"yes, it sounds better","To this ears, this SHM edition from japan sure sounds much better and less distorted than previous releases of the same remaster everywhere else.The same, although not so noticeable than in Zepp IV, goes to similar SHM editions of Zepp I, and ZeppII"
4,Good Sound Quality,"Mainly I wanted to report that the sound quality was very good.I purchased this CD used for my daughter. It's very good musicianship, although the composition it isn't entirely my cup of tea.FYI: I am a record collector of 55 years and a sometimes deejay."
3,Blame it on the radio,"I am so sick of ""Black Dog"", I want to throw up. ""The Battle of Evermore"" holds up better, as does ""When the Levee Breaks"" and ""Going to California""."
3,Not as cool as....,"None of these songs on here are nearly as cool as ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"" on the white album. Led zeppelin 4 is just not musically interesting. Long live the killer white album"
4,Really Friggin' Good But...,"The songs on Zeppelin IV are incredible, but there's only 8. Besides Four Sticks, all of them are up there with the best songs of all time, but is it worth spending [item price] on a CD that only has 8 songs? Get an anthology, they all have the good songs from Zeppelin IV on them."
5,Tell Only What You Know,"Chances of you reading this review are very slim so I won't get too eloquent. I watched the 100 Greatest Albums show on Vh1 and was very disappointed with 2 albums that I got because of it: Led Zeppelin I & Led Zeppelin II. I have heard III is good, and Physical Graffiti is alright. But the 2 solid albums are Led Zeppelin IV & Led Zeppelin V, probably Led Zeppelin IV being even more so. Led Zeppelin V (Houses of the Holy) is a very soothing album and was my favourite Led Zeppelin album until I heard IV. Now I just think both albums are great, in different ways, on different levels.So you now you know...the full story"
5,The best collection of songs ever!,"ABout a year ago i was one of those 11 year kids who listens to [...]. I didnt even like any rock and roll untill my uncle said he would give me 30$ if i could play stairway to heaven front to end.It took me about a month to learn all of it. at the begging of that time my cd consisted of linkin park emenim all american rejects and weezer.But by the time i learned the song i had AC/DC,Mettallica,Ramones,Nirvana,The Doors, guns n'roses, and jimi hendrixon AS my favorite bands ever. Buy LED ZEPPELIN IV!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Lenmar camera battery,"I have purchased thes products for my other Panasonic cameras. The last battery did not charge well in the charging cradle, but this one works just fine. It is a good buy for the money"
5,Great alternative to expensive batteries,Does exactly what it is supposed to do for a whole lot cheaper. I can see no differnece in longevity vs. the Panasonic brand that came with my FZ-50 camera.
1,Crap....for the FZ-40,"I looked at the buyers also bought and amazon suggestions. This battery came up on both. So, I figured it would be a good idea....you know how bad it sucks to lose battery life.Well, It came as promised with my total order. I looked at the 2 ....damn thing doesnt fit my camera. NOW why is everyone buying these with there FZ-40? And why did AMAZON suggest it?Amazon will only replace the same battery...so, Im kind of screwed.Maybe a good production...dunno and really dont care....can only use soemthing different."
1,Didn't Fit My Panasonic FZ35,"Amazon implies, and several reviewers have stated, that this battery works with the Panasonic FZ35. However, the one I received was too large and would not fit into the camera."
3,Good Camera Battery,"Batteries aren't something you can use for a couple of weeks and say that they're excellent because it takes far more time than that to determine but so far this battery has been good and has lasted quite well between chargings, so at this stage it looks like it's a good product. Lithium Ion batteries have shelf lives though so once some more time goes by I'll really be able to say it's a good replacement battery or not. Can I recommend it to others? Not just yet but at least it seems to have been a good buy."
4,Ordered as a birthday gift-seems to be fine.,I ordered this to go with a gift camera. Seems to work fine. Arrived on time.
5,Great battery - GREAT price!,I love my camera but didn't want to spend the $60 Panasonic wanted for a new battery. I found this one and it works as good as the one from Panasonic (when that one was brand new) I am very pleased with my purchase.
5,Battery for Panasonic digital camera,I suggest you have a back up battery with any camera. It's terrible to be shooting and loose power. I found other sites the give better deals on these though. Shop around.
3,Spotty life,I doubt if the specifications mean much. One battery is doing nicely the other pretty much gave up the ghost after perhaps taking a charge three times.In no case did the batteries match the useful life of the Panasonic batteries that ironically are rated at a lower MaH!
1,Stopped charging,It worked fine for 3 months and then it stopped charging. The Amazon return period was one month. The manufacturer claims to have a 3 year warranty but wants $7.50 handling charge. That is absurd for a $12 item. Why should I pay to return a defective item? All I can do is write bad reviews in many places.
5,New Custmer,"Yes. Recently a new customer to Amazon.com. I am very pleased with the battery that I purchase and have purchased other Items at this time also. Since being pleased with these Items, I have purchased several other items for my digital camera....Just waiting for them to arrive.Purchased several lens filters and (2) more batteries along with a couple more SDHC memory cards. If we are as satisfied with the lens filters as we are with the battery and SDHC card, we will be purchasing our Lenses along with anything else that we need to purchase that they offer...Had doubts at first because of the price savings,but VERY PLEASED. Thank You @ Amazon for Terrific Savings, which allows the purchase of more Items at a Quicker Rate."
5,No difference between this and battery that came with camera,Bought this as a spare battery for my Panasonic Lumix FZ35. Took it on a 16-day cruise where I took 2700 digital pictures and have used for almost a year since. I have found no difference in battery life or recharging ability from the Panasonic battery that came with the camera. Highly recommended.
1,Warranty is pathetic.,"This battery worked fine during the span of time when it actually worked. Then yesterday (seven months later) it will no longer take a charge.Ordinarily, a single battery that died would not cause me to write a one-star review; after all, batteries die. The reason for this review is because the battery warranty is a joke. Even for something as light as a battery, they want a $7.50 ""processing fee"" to ship you a new one, and that is AFTER you ship them the old one at your own expense. As another poster pointed out, why on earth would I ever do this for a $12 item? Charging you a ""processing fee"" to replace a defective item is an insult.As a corollary to this, why on earth would I ever buy a Lenmar battery ever again? These clowns aren't getting a second chance to fool me...I'm very glad I did not have the ""opportunity"" to learn this on a priceless vacation."
3,Great at first,"This battery was great at first. But after a year of use it won't hold a charge at all. After being fully charged it will take about 5 picture before dying. Considering the price difference it might still be worth it, but mine didn't hold up nearly as well as the Panasonic battery."
1,Love these batteries NOT SO MUCH!,"I typically take 300 to 400 photos daily when traveling with no problems unless using frequent flash. Perfect spare battery during heavy use with flash. Also nice when traveling and I forget to recharge a battery.NEW INFORMATION Jan 2013: I have purchased these Lenmar batteries, 2 or 3 a year since March 2009. The quality has diminished significantly with my orders of July 2012 and November 2012. Although I have not done volume photo shoots (Christmas, weddings, traveling) during 2012, my batteries did not last long. Since November I have had to rotate the 3 batteries I purchased on Nov.12th during any situation using flash. I was only able to take at most a dozen photos using flash with freshly charged batteries. Now I get 3 flash photos with a freshly charged battery before my camera does not respond. VERY DISAPPOINTING. I have switched to another brand."
1,Didn't work,"This battery would not charge with the Panasonic charger for the Lumix DMC-FZ35, as it was purported to do. It was worthless."
4,Works like a charm,Initially there was a small issue of the terminals not contacting the charger properly. A little bit of prod and it started to charge. Almost equals the number of shots of the proprietary battery. Get 4 of these than one of the OEM.
1,Did not work at all,"Tried to charge it. But it does not work at all. The charging light went on for less than 5 seconds and remained off thereafter. Kept the charger and batter on power outlet over the night, hoping to charge it properly. It was not charged at all."
5,Lenmar DLP006 Lithium-ion review,I brought this battery as a back up to the one that came with my Panasonic DMC-FZ28K. So far no issues. I have not used it that much yet and only charged once.
3,battery life,Works fine but doesn't keept it's charge like the original panasonic battery that came with the camera
4,Good Battery; Good Buy,"Value for money, works just fine. Felt the charging time is a notch more but then guess its okay for the price. Have charged it twice and so far no issues..."
4,Works OK so far,"Haven't really had much time to use this, but it charged up just fine, and is working in my Panasonic FZ-50 without any problems so far."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this product just before going on vacation because I had misplaced my other spare battery. I didn't have a lot a of money to spend so I bought the cheap batteries since the reviews were not that bad. When I got them home they would not charge and when they finally did seem to charge, they didn't didn't work. That is all. They just didn't work. Lucky for my I found my other batteries before the trip. I am glad some people have had good luck with these batteries, I was just one of the unlucky ones I guess. Just use your own judgement and know that you might get stuck with a dud if you do choose to purchase Lenmar DLP006."
1,Wrong Battery,I ordered the battery as it was recommended with the camera(Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ40 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 24x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black)). This is the wrong battery for the camera. It should not be sold with the camera as a spare battery.
1,Simply does not work,"I bought one as a backup for the standard battery that came with the camera, but since the charger can not charge it, the battery is useless. Also, since its price is not worth the return freight, it does not pay to return it. I feel scammed."
4,Analog SciFi magazine,My favorite SF magazine which I usually cannot find at the newsstand so a subscription is the solution to access
2,Amazon overpriced compared to best Dell direct subscription offer.,"Analog Science Fiction & FactIf you subscribe directly through Dell, they send you a final 'welcome back' 65% off offer for Asimov's and Analog; 24 issues for $38.97. ($1.63 a copy) Or, if you only want Analog, or Asimov's, 12 copies of either will cost you $21.97."
2,It is OK,"I subscribed to Analog last year, and did not renew my subscription.I love hard science fiction. Why only two stars? Because some of the stories are very, very bad. The editors seem to place stories that have a good concept, but are written poorly.For good consistent enjoyable reading, may I recommend Fantasy and Science Fiction? Excellent stories last year, I never threw it across the room (that did happen with Analog btw), and there was always a story that I went to see if there was anything else to read by that author.Updated January 2013 - My experience with the year I subscribed to was so poor I still have not tried this 'zine again."
1,Ironic that...,"... I found myself reading the reviews of Analog only to find a review by none other than Robert Sawyer, whose current serialized novella in Analog is the first thing I've ever read in Analog that has made me want to throw an issue away. Great magazine, except for when Sawyer is in it."
1,Lousy scholarship,"A thousand accusations, not a single one of which is documented in such a way that an honest inquirer could check up on it. Ancient and medieval popes are described in such emotionally charged detail that it is clear that 1) no primary historical sources painted such a portrait and that therefore 2) the author simply embellished where his sources (if he consulted any) were lacking. A 400+ page book with no footnotes and no bibliography...hmmmm. It suggests that Mr de Rosa was considerably more interested in writing a hatchet job than an honest and truthful look at the papacy."
4,Excellent information for thos suffering from tinnitus,"I am an audiologist and am begining to set up a tinnitus clinic. I was at a conference and the speaker strongly recommended this book. It has excellent information regarding tinnitus and tinnitus therapy, good for both the patient and practitioner."
3,Childs Play,I remember this toy when I was young years ago. This brought some great memories back to me. I bought this for my niece and she liked. She did tell me that it wasn't a toy her friends wanted to play with her.
5,Fun game,I bought this game for my son to use as part of OT. He loves the game and it is just as fun when I played the game as a child.
4,Old Fashioned Fun!!,This game brings back so many great memories! I purchased this for one of my son's Christmas presents last year and he likes it a lot! We've had a few fun nights playing with it so far. It's just still a hassle keeping up with those little pieces tho..
1,Don't Buy!!! Timer Doesn't Work!,I Remembered this game from my childhood - back when thing were built halfway decent. I bought this game online for my 5 year old and the timer didn't work - would click down to about 30 seconds and stop. You have to bang on the thing to keep the timer going. Then I bought one from a local store.... Same thing - timer sticks. This is not a fluke - this is just a poorly made toy. Too bad - it could be a great game if they fixed the timer!
2,Timer does not work!!,I bought this toy for my 5 year old nephew. I was very disappointed to find the timer often gets stuck and has to be tapped or reset several times during each round. This completely ruins the game.
2,Timer Did Not Work Straight Out of the Box,"I liked this game as a kid, and thought my five-year-old would enjoy it too. Unfortunately, the timer didn't work (at all) fresh out of the box. I returned it and got my money back, but I am loath to purchase Perfection again."
3,Perfection is not Perfect.,This game could be greatly improved if the timer could be adjusted to give players a longer time to complete putting the shapes in the correct spaces. Our family ended up playing in two man teams rather than solo.
5,Splat!,Get all the pieces in the board before time runs out or you will hear splat! And all the pieces will pop out this toy coulds entertain you for hours! Great for kids.
3,Too LOUD!,"I bought this for my daughter, but it's just too loud. It's also quite startling when it pops up, even for me."
1,Bogus ratings,"These highly favorable reviews look like one bogus author padded the space trying to push this toy. Many repititious sections, ""my 3-year-old,"" ""blast,"" ""as a child,"", on and on. I don't buy them at all."
4,Just like when we were kids,We bought this for Hanukkah for our sons this year and it's just as I remembered it. The popping of the game scared one of my sons the first few times but then he got used to it. It's a great addition to any game collection!
4,As I remember,"I got this for a Christmas present for mr Grandkids. I hope they will like it. I remember having one when I was a child and thought it was fun. It seems to be the same game, only smaller, or maybe just because I was smaller."
5,still as fun now as it was when we were kids,"Even younger children can improve their concentration by trying to fit all these pieces in the correct slots. I thought my 4 year old would be discouraged by the time running out, but actually most kids think it's fun when the pieces explode, even if that means they are ""losing."" By helping your kids the first few times and then letting them try it seems to be the best way to get them interested. I still found it as much fun as it was when I was young. Probably best for 5 and up, but even younger kids will enjoy trying to fit the pieces in. If you don't want the ""stress"" for little kids, just have them put the pieces in without pushing down the board and using the timer!"
4,Perfect!!,This game is great for all ages. My two kids ages 7 and 4 play this together. Sometimes they beat the clock and other times they don't!! They have alot of fun. It is great for fine motor skills as well as recognizing different shapes etc. Sometimes my 4 year old plays by himself and doesn't set the timer. He just puts the shapes in and feels very proud after he gets them all in their correct places. Great game!!
1,Timer dose not work,Like many other reviews state...THE TIMER DOES NOT WORK!!!! Opened it today and returning it today. Don't waste your time.
4,Perfection,great toy! used for Special needs children. teaches great fine motor skills as well as academic.
5,Fun for All,My kids laugh and laugh at playing this game! They love taking turns to see who can get it filled up the quickest before the timer goes off!!! It encourages them to be competitive and is fun enough for Moms & Dads to participate. WE LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Challenging,"This game is actually pretty challenging because of the small size of the pieces and the short amount of time you are given. I like it because it strengthens hand-eye coordination, but I am an adult and usually can't beat this game. If you want your child to have a challenge that they won't soon outgrow, consider this game."
3,"Good book, DVD is handy","The book is good, but the DVD tends to be more useful when looking for options and tools. The DVD must be played with the supplied player on the DVD, and this may be hard to find if you don't look for it and the autorun does not load. Normal DVD programs cannot play the DVD content of the disk."
5,Strengths of the Feminine Diaspora,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, watched the extras and immediately wanted to watch it all again. The beauty of the cinematography; the universality of the message; and the abundance of strengths of the Diaspora, particularly the women was beautiful. I especially enjoyed the subtle and not so subtle images of spirituality. Highly recommended."
4,Magical Realism in Black CInema,"The story takes place around the turn of the century, and is about a gathering of the black Pesant family of the Sea Islands off the Carolinas as they prepare to migrate north, out of the world of former slaves in a rural society and into the modern era in the city. I found this film to be visually beautiful and deeply human. The Sea Island English dialect of the characters took a little getting used to, but was well worth the effort of understanding. The clan is large and multi generational, and they take time to honor their oldest member, great grandmother Nana Pesant. Her statement, ""The ancestor and the womb is one and the same. Respect your ancestors, call on them for strength."" is the underling theme of the film. All of this action is clothed in profound visual beauty, and magical events and memory weave through the fabric of the film. Believe me, you don't have to be black to enjoy this film. I loved it, and feel that it is on a par with the best of Fellini."
5,Excellant service,"I have come to believe that Amazon provides the best service anywhere. Before I look for a product anywhere (eletronics, books, video, music) I first check with Amazon. Rarely, rarely do I not find what I want. Thank you"
1,AWFUL MOVIE,"This movie is so unrealistic you just stand in stupid awe as it goes on and on and on and on. What black people do you know that just stands around on a beach dressed in white basically doing nothing? No, not in my world! It touches on witchcraft which I despise. It's a very boring movie. I kept waiting for the plot to begin and kept looking for it throughout the movie. This is the worse movie I have seen so far! No real plot, no real acting, nothing to look forward to at all. A genuine waste of money!"
1,It was so boring,I was very bored with this movie and there wasn't any plot to it..it was to long....and I don't feel like I fully understood it.
1,"Beautiful scenery, awful movie","Avoid this movie! Save your money to go visit the obviously beautiful island this movie is filmed at, because that is the only thing worthwhile in this very strange and disturbing movie. My class was forced to watch it at school and no one I talked to enjoyed it (or even understood most of it). It is a very bizarre movie that very few people could enjoy. Basically, it is a movie which poindexter professors will think is intetellectual, but in reality is only strange. It also has a very negative agenda. Over all, it is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
5,Beautiful Story,"A delightful blend of history and folklore that is the unique history of the American south. A must view for people of color, especially those that have Southern roots and in Gullah culture. I enjoyed the book more but books are always more in depth and richer."
3,not a walk in the park,"RIVERS OF JOY, a live worship CD recorded in Colorado Springs and led by Don Moen, features a highly-trained Big Choir, an interesting solo or two, audience participation, and the appearance of spontaneity.If you like the genre of 'worship experiences', highly choreographed performances directed by a guy at the piano with an avuncular mode and a mike always at hand, you may well like this 1995 Hosanna Music release. It features the usual suspects on any list of upbeat praise-and-worship playlists.Although I appreciate all that this sort of project means for those involved in it and even for many who listen after the fact, enthusiasm eludes me. But this may be your cup of tea. It's top-rate in terms of performance and production."
5,"Fascinating, like the title says!","This book delivers exactly what a general reference should- well organized photos and data, (including color ""chips"") plus a thumbnail history for a decade of American cars, year by year, maker by maker.The photos and layout are a feast for the eyes. This is a great book to browse, as well as a handy reference and car spotter's guide.The paper quality seems a bit thin, and the metallic dust jacket is prone to scuffing. Take care with it, because it will quickly look like a used book if not handled carefully. The recently done illustrations by Frank Peiler are a bit crude compared to the vintage advertising illustrations, but they are only for chapter headings.Overall the quality of presentation and info is 5 star. I know I will get both an education and a lot of browsing enjoyment from this book."
3,Meh...,"Watching this movie made me very very sad. I was hoping for an epic thrill ride like the original Battle Royale, but was greatly let down. The creator of this shoddy sequel was just trying to push his views on society throughout the entire movie. I would have gladly watched another round of BR as was shown in the first movie, just with new characters and new awesome. This is not horrible, but not what I was hoping for."
1,Terrible movie,"As previous viewers have pointed out, this movie is absolutely horrible. While it can be argued that the wildly overrated Battle Royale is imbued with some relevance given its supposed social commentary concerning the flaws in modern Japanese society, this movie is limited to a childish and inexplicable Anti-americanism. A scene justifying the 9-11 attacks, at the beginning of the film, is the perfect example of this.But perhaps the most unforgivable flaw of this movie is how unbelievably boring it is. I have a large collection of Japanese films and I can say unequivocally that this is the worst of the bunch.If I could give this horrible movie zero stars I would. Buy this at your own risk."
3,small,"A bit smaller than I thought it would be....and the silver wire seemed very fragile, but my daughter loved it."
1,Not what I expected,I bought this cd because my daughter who is eleven months loves Jacks big music show. Milkshake has a couple of really cute songs and videos on it so I thought this would be like that. It is not at all like that. Maybe when she is older she will like this but I don't recommend it for this age or younger. They have interviews with the band between songs and the videos are a little wierd. Not anything like the ones they have done for Jacks Big Music Show.
2,Not totally rotten,"Interesting idea, but after a couple of chapters gets repetitive and the descriptions are somewhat vague, could be talking about any sign. Good for a few laughs but I will not refer back or read it again."
5,Highly entertaining!,"The cover was the first thing that caught my attention. Any book with a cover that funny had to be worth reading. I was not disappointed. Every other astrology book I have ever read is completely focused on the good aspects of the zodiac. This book was truly refreshing. Not only did this book focus on all the problems of the zodiac , but it gave advice on how to deal with it. I was laughing the entire time I read this book. It was also nice to have both sexes described. I never knew the difference before!"
3,cute but predictable after a while...,"when you pick this up, you will be laughing or so offended that you might not get through the book.i think most people will be in the former crowd.it's very funny i tell you that. and mostly dead on but after a while, it runs in circles with its information and you will get bored....worth a read, but a buy?i don't deem it necessary.3.5 stars.end note: and if you want a positive look at the zodiac signs, PLEASE, LOOK ELSEWHERE. born on a rotten day portrays just that; in ALL of us!"
5,"Cute, satyrical book on the sun signs","Don't expect a serious interpretation of your birth chart from this book. It's written about sun signs and it's meant to be funny and cute!Perfect gift for people who are mildly interested in astrology and want to laugh while learning more about what it means to be an Aries, Pisces or whatever their sign is."
3,"Accurate, but boring","This book is accurate, but boring. If you are not a serious astrology student, skip it. You can find better books if you just want a comprehensive book on sun signs.I advise people who want astrology books to go to an actual book store & spend time browsing through what they have. Unless you know someone who has a lot of those books you can borrow, this is the best way to get a feel for astrology books.Also, there are a lot of astrology books that are accurate but poorly written. I only recommend those books for hardcore astrology students to study and add to their collection."
1,Inaccurate,"This book gave me nothing I could use. I'm a Leo and all I read about my sign is that we all love parties, and being the center of attention. Is there nothing else to know about my sign, besides being bossy and conceited? Definitely not my personality. I'd recommend more serious work, like Linda Goodman."
2,oh well,"Ordered this toy for my wife, but was not what we expected upon arrival. It's ok, but had hoped for a more deluxe edition with bigger playing board."
5,A great game for all ages!,I just like to say what a great game this is for all ages and all the family. I enjoy playing it alot over the internet with other people from all around the world [....]
4,great fun,"Upwards is a really fun word game. It's different and quicker than Scrabble, but you still must think. If you like scrabble, you'll like Upwards. My only complaint is the ""qu"" tile - it doesnt allow you to make words like qat."
1,just make it stop,This games scoring is too confusing. My friends fought over it for 25 minutes. and then they just put the game away. I'm not so sure what was worse the rampent testosterone or the confusion of the actual scoring. As I write this i am being told to email the company and ask how to score it. Ridiculous. there is something wrong with this game and my friend mike.
3,"Fast paced game to play, learning at the same time",My family likes playing Scrabble so we thought we'd give UpWords a chance. It definitely doesn't take as long to play because not as much thought goes into your word choices since each tile has counts for either 1 or 2 points. The price was right at Amazon. A lot cheaper compared to the local store prices! My only complaint is the quality of this game. All plastic! Very cheaply put together. Typical of today's game quality.
5,Your vacabulary will climb Upwords!,"This game is much more fun than Scrabble! My kids (13 and 9) were thrilled to find the gift under our Christmas tree this year. They usually only get to play this game at their Nana's, but now they can play it whenever they want. The best challenge was trying to make another word from the already existing ones. Enjoy this challenging, mind expanding game with kids of all ages! Even my four year old can change dog to hog! Have fun!"
3,Cheap Knockoff sent by Ifunsale.,"I'm don't usually complain, but I was seriously disappointed in my recent purchase of the classic Upwords game. It was advertised as being made by Hasbro and cost twice what the new brightly colored version costs. Instead I got a knockoff. It did not have the sturdy Hasbro stand and the box had a different picture than the one online.If I'd paid $15 for it rather than $30, I'd be okay with it. But it's not a $30 set and not what was shown. And it's probably illegal. ""Hasbro"" didn't appear anywhere on the box.BBPS: I complained to ifunsale and today received an offer for a full refund. They did not know it was a knockoff and stopped selling it after they learned of it, they said. So they made it right. But I am asking only for half refunded, since that's what I would have paid for the red and blue version if I'd known this one had the flimsy stand and was a knockoff."
4,"Finally found ""UPWORDS""","My 95-year-old aunt in Charlotte, NC, plays the board game UPWORDS every Saturday with a friend. Aunt Ann introduced it to me and I tried to find it in stores. No luck at all. In fact, a young (early 20's) clerk in one store told me, ""Oh, they don't make that anymore."" I didn't check to see if they do or they don't - suddenly got the idea that it might be on amazon.com and...voila!!...it was!! Amazon got it to me as fast as the postal service media mail class could get it to me! And now I can play the fun word game UPWORDS any time I can find a challenger. Hurray for amazon.com!!"
2,Love the game--disappointed in the revised version,"In our family we have played UPWORDS forever and love it! It's fun for all ages and more challenging than Scrabble. However, this new version is not so nice. Instead of the wonderful old wooden tiles which were large enough to manipulate easily, we now have scaled down size with plastic tiles that are awkward and clumsy, especially for elderly hands. Please, Hasbro, bring back the old version. What were you thinking?I am still looking for the ""old"" version, if anyone knows where I can find one."
2,Difficult to use.,"While extremely thorough, this compilation is extremely hard to use. I have trouble navigating through the different stories and articles. There doesn't seem to be a workable main table of contents that would make navigation through the book much easier."
4,"America, the Story of Us will keep the interest of even the casual student of history.","Although not a deep and scholarly work, this was interesting enough that I read it in one sitting and then read it again more slowly. This would be an excellent introductory work for immigrants who are in the process of becoming American citizens. The videos added considerably to my enjoyment of the work."
2,Complete Works of Mark Twain,"This is a treasure trove if you enjoy Twain. Sadly, it is difficult to navigate and find your way to the novel you want to read. I recommend it if you are patient and persistent, and it only costs you $2.99 to download it as I did."
1,No spacing or indents,"I cheaped out and bought this to read Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, but neither of those have any indents or spacing between paragraphs, making it very irritating to try to read. I manned up and spent five bucks for the Mobi version, and it looks much better, indented and spaced, and even has illustrations on several of the works. I admit I made the same mistake with Shakespeare. The cheap version was irritatingly difficult to read, and the Mobi version was superior. I'm looking for Mobi versions first from now on. Here's the Mobi link to the complete Mark Twain:Works of Mark Twain: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Mysterious Stranger, A Dog's Tale, The Innocents Abroad, A ... Arthur's Court, Roughing It & more (mobi)"
5,Love it,"I'm still reading it and it is fascinating. Twain was a true observer and lover of mankind. Though it is his ""biography,"" it tells many true and interesting tales about the interesting people he knew. He had a way of adding ""color"" to everyone."
1,complete works of Mark Twain,"This was not a good experience because there was no table of contents. I therefore returned it immediately. Perhaps there was an error in transmissionbut that was my experience.Thank you,Fred"
5,Cubano music,"This CD is a sample of very upbeat Cubano-American music. DJ Lazz really out-did himself. I heard this when I had a tape player 15 yrs ago, I just had to have it on CD also."
3,Is Not THAT Good,"I read the reviews above and went ahead and got it , and no big deal . More of the same recycled theme's . Lacks , 2 me , the Energy of Jahmekya and Joy and Blues . Liked DragonFly because it shows a different perspective , ala Ivan Neville , with a Reggae twist . Otherwise , Reggae seems a little lost these days ."
5,Great.,"This is a great Ziggy CD. I usually find myself skipping a few songs on his CDs, but this CD is different. All the songs are different, somewhat toned down a bit from his previous CDs. I noticed that Stephen, Ziggy, Damian, and Julian all worked on this CD. I hadnt noticed that before. I dont think Damian played a part in anything but the drums though. Buy it."
4,Don't start 3D puzzles with this one,"This was my first 3D puzzle and therefore was a bit complex in the beginning. I don't think the directions are incredibly clear. However, someone who has experience would be able to overcome that. I choose this particular puzzle because I like this artist. All the little details are especially fun! I found that trying to put the base together FIRST was nearly impossible because there were too many pieces to choose from. Therefore, my nephews helped put the buildings together, eliminating many of those pieces, which made it easier to do the base. I encourage you to work on it with family and friends--it makes for an enjoyable time."
5,AMAZING,"This cleaner will get out ANYTHING. New and very old stains are no problem. I have tried everything on these multiple spots that were left by the previous owner. 4 years later, this stuff, take them out in just one small application. AMAZING is the only word that I can use to describe this cleaner.It will take out dirt, oil, grease, wine, mold, blood,.....ANYTHING and only in one application!"
4,Great on new stains,"This cleaner is amazing on new carpet stains. During a recent furniture delivery, the delivery person got a dark, black, oily stain on our light beige carpet. We started spraying the Dyzolv on it within a couple of minutes, rubbed at it with a towel, and it disappeared. It took a lot of spraying, maybe about 1/8 of the bottle, but it was worth it to get the dark ugly stain out. We vacuumed over the spot after it dried and it is now like it never happened. It has also made food stains (like tomato sauce) disappear if we get to them quickly. I have not have the same success with older stains - we have some faint gray spots from general dirt and debris being tracked into the house, and it didn't make much of a difference on those. But I will always have this on hand for new spills."
1,Way Overpriced,"I bought this Dyzolv spot remover based on the reviews which made it out to seem like the answer to tough spots. Upon using it, it works okay. It certainly isn't a miracle solution like the reviews here on Amazon made it out to be. Also, 13 bucks is a lot to pay for such a small can (think Glade air freshner small). I'll be looking for less expensive spot removers in larger quantities. I also noticed the spray nozzle is cheap and frustrating. BAD BUY for the price!! Look elsewhere and don't be fooled by the 11 5-star ratings this product has gotten on Amazon. They are not deserved."
2,We preferred Rick Steve's,"After our first week in Paris, we left all the other guide books, including this one behind at the hotel and kept our Rick Steve's guide. Sorry Michelin, he's got you beat."
2,get the regional guides for depth information,"I have fond memories of the French Michelin Guide I had 20 years ago. But it was a regional Guide (Provance). What I loved about that book was that it seemed anything of cultural importance in a town (or village) was mentioned in the Guide. That is not the case with this overview version for all of France.The other problem with this book is that it is organized alphabetically. If you want to plan a day trip from Paris you will need either another book or a lot of map reading to decide what to look up in this Guide.The regional Michelin Guides are unique, and clearly worth the high ratings they receive. I can't see why anyone would buy this excerpted version."
1,One star for the concept,"Denver Pyle & Sorrell Booke must be rolling over in their graves. One question: Gy Waldron, how could you let this (& that movie in '05) happen? Yeah, I love the Dukes. I love the characters & I didn't even mind the ringers Coy & Vance from season 5, but what has happened in the recent years is intolerable. The Dukes was a family show, but now its been turned into some R-rated sophomoric lampoon garbage. No more heart. I like the casting of Harland Williams as Roscoe P. Coltrane, but man, this is sad. Real sad."
1,TERRIBLE,"I have never written a review on here, but I just had to for this....the dumbest movie of all time. It has ruined the Dukes. Uncle Jesse, (Denver Pyle), is rolling in his grave."
2,"Just not that great, only a few laughs","This movie really did not hold true to the story of the dukes of hazzard. It was just these two kids running around and doing things that are done in most college comedies, like driving through a locker room. It's just not the dukes. The Roscoe character is not the stubborn officer of the law that we know, and the whole Boss Hog thing, well, just not like the one in the series. I can not believe Willie Nelson re-signed for his role as Uncle Jesse again. I hope they do not try to continue this series. Rent it if you must, you may laugh a few times, but then return with care."
2,"I don't really know what to say that hasn't already been said, just not great","The 2005 movie was not good at all. I felt it was incosistent with the original Dukes who were more like Robin hood than just rowdy moonshiners, and this movie doen't do much to that. The acting is horrible, and I can't believe Willie Nelson signed on for this one. I thought at times this might have a glimmer of the original series, such as the boys actually messing around with Rosco than Rosco being a Hard edged sherrif, but then it would loose it again in bad script and acting. Rent if you must, but just not a great movie."
3,not as title says,this is just the movie that they are talking about not a different movie that we have all seen
1,A Travesty,This will be short because I do not want to waste anymore of my time thinking about this film.What were they THINKING when they made this?The only points in this film in which there is a relation to the original The Dukes of Hazard are the characters' names and the car.And what was Willie Nelson thinking to even be involved with this travesty?
3,More dust than fun,"Older boys play younger ones and not so sexy stuff appears despite context advertised as cousins helped older uncle to keep his farm from a reach of greedy local politician.""Spring break"" is much better."
3,Meeker Review,"I gave this movie a 3. Not because it was bad or anything. Believe me, the movie was in perfect condition. I just didnt think it was that great of a movie."
1,awful,Good driving scenes is the only thing that could have saved this turd but it didnt even have that.
1,Buy the 2005 movie not this one,"Not to get me wrong, I'm a big fan of The Dukes of Hazzaed. I loved the series, I liked the cartoon, I even enjoyed the 2005 movie. But, The beginning is a Disgrace to The Dukes, and The General Lee. But most of all, it's a insult to us fans."
1,Worst prequel ever,Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs. It is horribly acted and none of the characters are even like they were on the tv show much less that stupid movie with Jessica Simpson.
1,A Very Crappy Beginning!!!,"Back when I was obsessed with The Dukes of Hazzard, I saw this movie. I HATED IT! It was supposed to be a prequel to the movie, and they fixed it up in this one, and in the original (which is supposed to be the next one, it's crappy and THEN they fix it up. Another thing I didn't like was the sexual tension between Luke Duke and Lulu Hogg. If you love the original Dukes of Hazzard series, trust me, DO NOT WATCH THE DUKES OF HAZZARD: THE BEGINNING!!!"
3,THAT IS THE CAR!,"The film is a supposed prequel to the popular Dukes of Hazzard franchise. The film gives us glimpses of Bo (Jonathan Bennett) and Luke (Randy Wayne) before they go live with their uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson). It also shows us the finding of the General Lee in a lake, the initial rift with Boss Hogg, and the transformation of Daisy Duke.The accents were for the most part terrible. The unrated version featured numerous topless blonds that made the transformation of Daisy Duke into a vixen, anti-climatic. Harland Williams as Roscoe was over the top. The film was very corny and not well done.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, some implied sex. Ample nudity (Casey Durkin, Carrie Minter plus many others)"
1,RUINED,"THIS MOVIE WAS AWFUL. IT'S LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS MOVIE NEVER SAW A SINGLE EPISODE OF THE DUKES OF HAZZARD. THIS IS NOT HOW THEY ENDED UP IN HAZZARD. IF THEY HAVE WATCHED SOME OF THE ORIGINAL EPISODES OF THE DUKES OF HAZZARD, THEY WOULD HAVE NOTICED WHAT BROUGHT BO, LUKE AND DAISY TO LIVE WITH THEIR UNCLE JESSE. IF THEY ARE GOING TO TRY AND UPDATE THE MOVIES TO TODAY YOUTH, THEN THEY NEED TO WATCH SOME OF THE ORIGINAL EPISODES AND STOP TRYING TO CHANGE THE PERSONALITY OF THE CHARACTER. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYBODY WHO IS A TRUE FAN OF THE DUKES OF HAZZARD."
2,The true prequel is 'Moonrunners',"I haven't seen 'The Beginning' yet, but I did see the behind the scenes on CMT. I just noticed that the true prequel to the Dukes of Hazzard might be out soon on DVD, Moonrunners (sign up to be notified when the DVD is out). I haven't seen it either, but plan to buy it for sure. I'll pass on this one."
1,I'm going to take a wait and see,"The reason I'm taking a wait and see is that if this was like the DOH movie, forget it.One bad sign is bringing back Willie Nelson.Making Uncle Jessie a druggie was a disgrace.One good sign was not bringing back Burt Reynolds.Boss was a rat at heart, but would never have laid a finger on Jessie.The language was not earthy, it was vulgar.And Daisy was a flirt but still a lady.Jessica Simpson made her trashy.I'd like to hope that this prequel is truer to the spirit of the show.But we'll have to see."
4,funny stuff,"This is deffinatly how the dukes started in hazzard county. funny one liners and the hottest charger you have ever seen. these guys know how to pick up chicks, or at least try to."
3,Bill Shakespeare's review pretty much nails this.,"O.k., it's not that great of a movie, but it's not totally awful either. It is fun seeing Daisy's transformation, this Boss Hogg is better than Burt Reynolds, and it does flow into the TV series fairly well. HOWEVER...Uncle Jesse (sorry Willie) doesn't need to stoop to the boys' level humor-wise. He was supposed to be the patriarch, not be right in there with sex jokes, etc. There is no substitute for Ben Jones as Cooter, and Lara Flynn Boyle's entire character was plain offensive ... Lulu Hogg was not sex-starved, she was just a tacky good ol' girl. Wasn't Flash cute?;)"
1,NOT FOR KIDS! SHOULD BE RATED PG 13,Poor Casting and a very poor plot and bad acting! And the content contains Adult Sistuations not suitable for children. And they Broadcasted the show on ABC Family Channel. Who allowed this show? I recommend this show not be affiliated with the Dukes of Hazzard series.
2,Biography of a Biographer,The idea of this work is interesting but at the price for the results I won't buy again. If Craig weren't my friend I would never have bought this. The experience of getting it and using it was worth something.I learned nothing from this. I could have gotten more from a long distance call.
4,Asimov's Science Fiction,"It doesn't have a lot of the old-style writers (Silverberg comes to mind), but there are lots of great authors represented here. A real adventure!"
5,"Great gift, year after year!",I renew my husband's subscription to Asimov's and Analog every year for the holidays. He loves it and reads them all voraciously when they arrive. Perfect gift for any SciFi readers!
4,Always something different,"I have been reading Asimov's for a number of years. I may not always find all of the stories to my taste, however I enjoy the opportunity to read genres that I might not otherwise have read and it has helped me discover authors that I would have otherwise missed. Overall, it is well worthwhile."
3,Not all that bad,"I like science fiction. A lot.After receiving several issues of this I can now say, ""This doesn't suck, but it really isn't all that good."""
3,disappointed,Had heard the Hot Rod Lincoln cut on radio. It is a hoot. Should have just bought the cut not the album. Only listen to Hot Rod Lincoln and Rockabilly Funeral on regular basis.
2,Didn't know it would take so long,"I placed the order in the last few days of February and got it on April 13th. I never thought it would take so long to get here, it came so late I even had to cancel my class or buy another book(and pay twice for the same book). I would have gladly paid a couple bucks more to have it shipped priority. Other than that, the book came in good used condition. Maybe next term I can take the class that goes with the book."
5,Best ballhead on the market,"Versatile product, rock solid and yet light weight, easy to adjust, this product is incredibly well designed and engineered. Certainly the last ballhead I will ever buy."
4,Thomas Newman is DA MAN while others add nice mix.,"The main theme, by Thomas Newman, was enough to make me buy the cd. There are also two nice mixes featuring the same theme. I also enjoyed the other artists. This cd is certainly worth the price. BUY IT TODAY!!!"
5,wonderful,"if you love the show, you'll love this soundtrack...and if you don't love the show......what's wrong with you?"
3,List of artists/songs,The CD was in excellent condition so I'm very happy with the seller. I wasn't sure what I was buying though as there were several different options for Six Feet Under soundtracks. It would have been helpful to know the list of songs and artists. The music wasn't the ones I thought I was getting.
2,No Way,"You can get the old vintage aggravation games on Ebay for 10 or less and theres also some hand-made wooden boards as well. These new versions dont hold a candle to the old ones, Just as old tvs seem better than some of the new ones."
2,I don't like it.,"I chose this rating because this is not the same game as I was used to playing, even though it is Aggravation. The seller mailed it in a timely manner and it was new."
3,Little disappointed,The board is flat and thin and the marble doesn't sit well within the board when playing with children. Just a little disappointed for the cost.
2,"The new ""exciting"" board design is garish and confusing.",The old board did not need any updating. It was just fine. Now it is just confusing. If I had known that the board would be this bad I would not have bought it.
3,aggravating aggravation,We have had versions of this game for years. The one we ordered is not as durable as our old set and has a lot more graphics which is a bit confusing but fun. I wish they had heavier marbles and thicker cardboard.
5,great game!,My aunt introduced my sisters and I to this game 40 years ago and it's just as much fun (and aggravating) now as it was then! I've always had an Aggravation game in my house but I just got 3 of these for my nieces and nephews and 1 for my aunts grandson.
4,Fun game for children and adults.,"Even my husband, who is NOT a game player, loves playing Aggravation. We also like it because up to six people can play at once and it is a good board game when friends come over."
3,The Good Old Days are Gone,"I loved this game when I was a child, but now the marbles are plastic and the holes are not deep enough to hold the marbles very well. The concept is still fun, but the construction has suffered from the changes."
2,NOT the old classic,"I loved playing Aggravation as a kid. Countless hours at the dinning room table returned memories to last a lifetime. With the ""new"" board, I dread my kids choosing this game. The board is confusing, the shapes are distracting, and generally I find we think more about where we are supposed to go next than clearly considering strategy. I wouldn't even consider this game with a child or adult who had sensory, vision, or comprehension challenges. This board design is a failure on the part of the design team. Someone forgot to tell you that simple is best.On the bright side, I can always hope that I win the bidding war with my sisters for the set that has been in the family for 40 years!"
3,Not the old classic!,"This game is an old standard in my family. I can't remember the last family gathering we had where we didn't play a heated game of Aggravation. However, when I went to buy my own game board, this was all I could find. Not only did they make the board mind-numbing and hard to follow, but they changed the spacing on the board. And as for durability, both the board and the marbles are CHEAP! Parker Brothers should really consider going back to the old version."
3,Unmodified this game is just OK.,Aggravation:(1) Is good for the kids.(2) Is good for developing strategy.(3) Is good fun for all ages.But(4) Is really cheaply made.(5) Is an old and worn game. It is in serious need of upgrading.
2,Liked old version better!,"My daughter got this came for Christmas and it is still fun to play, but the new graphics are very confusing and hard to follow. They want a little overboard in their updating of this one. New colors would have been fine, but all the curves, zig-zags, etc, make this version a poor substitute for the older versions. I'm going to ebay!!"
4,Simpsons Photomosaic Jigsaw,"This Simpsons Photomosaic Jigsaw is basically a picture based on TV show where each piece is made up of a smaller image from the show, when put together make up the bigger picture. This aspect makes this reasonably harder than most other jigsaws and should keep die hard jigsaw fans occupied for that little bit longer. There are plenty of Jigsaws in the series and we have finished quite a few now and the others are worth looking out for. This sofa scene makes for a good first one in the series to try though.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,Poison,I purchased this for Christmas. My wife has had it years before. I know that she will love it. It's a very sensual scent! WHOA!!
2,Clash of the Quick Cut,"So, I bought this to show my Art History students for our Greek Unit. We laughed uproariously together. Zeus and Gnosis are these topless old guys with gold makeup and jewelry. The camera repeatedly cuts from one face to the next to the point of ridiculousness. The narrator is typically good with the pleasurable baritone, but the redundant shots give it the feel of a college film where there just wasn't enough time and money for more scenes. This is sad, considering the fact that it is the History Channel. That being said, I would show it again as it adds a bit of comedy to this horrendous creation story."
2,Non-experts making lame mistakes,"The production quality wasn't bad but the information presented was pathetically biased and incorrect. The slant about how Jesus killed all the old gods was stupid and unprovable. Then they got several details horribly wrong. Just one instance is where they say that Freya was Thor's sister. It takes about 3 minutes of research to see that there is absolutely NO grounds to say this as they were from separate tribes of Gods and had different parents. Last I checked you had to have the same parents to be brother and sister. If they would pull one easily falsified ""fact"" out of their butts like that then it is a little hard to swallow the other parts. Also, the section on Hades was pretty lame. Apparently in Christian mythology Hades was god of the underworld/place of the dead before Christ despite the fact that their doctrine was that there was only one God EVER! The ties between pre-christian and Christian mythologies is contrived and poorly argued."
1,Horrible!!!,I thought it was HORRIBLE!!!We wanted to see a documentary on Greek Mythology. We were highly disappointed by how the myths represented did not actually follow the classic stories.History Channel should be ashamed to have their name on this series.
4,on the whole excellent,"I am a high school teacher and my kids on the whole liked this series a lot and learned a great deal. I was actually surprised that the talking head professors who were interspersed into the action did not turn most teenagers off. I come at this with a classical perspective (I'm a Latin teacher) and my one serious qualm was that the production did not address the fact that there are usually several versions of the same myth; there is in fact no one canonical version, contrary to what this series implies. Different authorities give different versions of the stories. But I think this is a relatively minor proviso considering how much the series offers."
2,Awful narration,"These are relatively informative, but the bored narrator voice just doesn't go at all with some of the pretty neat visual effects and acting. The narrator put me to sleep - but the Greek myths are supposed to be exciting! It's not supposed to be like watching birds with David Attenborough! Awful conception - if you want to put your kids off ancient religions forever, here's a good start."
2,"Weak script, poorly cast.","There's about 20 minutes of a good movie here, and the rest is routine, slowly paced and poorly cast. Weakest of all is the guy in the lead, Robert Fucilla, who just doesn't have the emotional weight or grit for this role. In fact, it seems as if his best scenes are the ones where he's not talking. Most of the film involves guys running around in the woods, shooting at each other. The body count is high and the blood spews are plentiful. If only they'd made us care about the people involved."
5,One of my favorite books from my adolescence.,I read this book when I was in elementary school and loved it! We moved out of state a few years later and I've never been able to find it since. No library or bookstore has ever had it. But you do! I will be saving this for when I have a family of my own and my children will be able to enjoy the same books.Thank you!
1,distracting and dreamy(not the good kind),"I purchased this book to further my appreciation of architecture and was disappointed to discover this book only frustrates. I enjoy creative use of language to convey thoughts and ideas, however I feel this book fails to communicate much of anything other than disorganized emotions. I can best compare my experience reading this book to listening to the logic and argument of a 4 year old -only with bigger words."
2,Whats the big deal,I don't get why this is the bible of architects. Its boring as hell. Sure people are affected by the spaces they inhabit for various conditioning reasons. OK thats obvious but do I need to read a whole book written in pompous philospeak to learn that.Honestly I put it down half way. Too boring and too many other things to read. Life is short.
3,book,"I had bought this book for a friend, she had said something about this speaker and I found this book and purchased it for her."
5,The best olives in the World,Ate my first jar of these about 6 months ago nad have been addicted ever since...you have to try them!!
4,Good Grip,This grip is great to use. Gives the camera (D7000) the extra weight that I was looking for. I found out that you can not use AA batteries because it does not do well with the camera when it's time to switch between batteries. Suggest that you use the Nikon batter for both the camera and the grip! Have not had a problem with the grip since and enjoying every bit of it.
4,"Great for controlling the camera, durability so-so","This has worked fine for controlling the camera, for a couple of years now. It makes the camera balance better in your hand (adds weight that I think the camera needed). It also increases the height of the camera body, which makes it fit my hand perfectly. People with smaller hands might not like that!The durability question comes from the fact that the slide-in adapter that lets you use standard AA rechargeable batteries worked briefly before apparently no longer making contact when inserted into the grip. Even with a known set of good, charged AAs in it, it doesn't work. It has me puzzled, because the adapter is a very simple piece of equipment, with nothing but a plastic frame holding the batteries and a few metal pieces connecting their ends ...I just contacted the manufacturer to see about getting a replacement battery holder for it - here's hoping!"
3,Works well needs a wider brush,Works quite well but the brush is awful small so it does take some time to do a 1000 piece puzzle.
3,Solid Product,"I used this on a landscape puzzle of Las Vegas, 1.5 feet by 3.5 feet - so it was a large puzzle.The puzzle has stayed together fabulously, so no complaints there. Even survived a vicious house cat attack without breaking apart.My complaint is that as the puzzle dried, the edges curled up so the puzzle didn't lay flat anymore. This was a problem when I hung it on the wall because I had to nail every corner and some random other nails into it to keep it flat. I would say the edges curled 1-2"" off the wall, so it was kind of significant and bothersome to look at or walk past.I suppose this could be avoided in the future by weighing the puzzle down as it dried, but I didn't know that ahead of time."
4,This is pretty basic stuff.,"This glue is easy to apply (even in sections, for unfinished puzzles), and dries clear. However, I haven't used any other brand of puzzle glue, so I can't really compare this kind to anything else. The bottle contains enough glue to cover 1 medium-sized puzzle and 1 large-sized puzzle (23'x33'). You will probably want to apply two coats in order to get the puzzle rigid enough to mount on a wall -- and in this case, 1 bottle per puzzle should be the rule.I did have some problems with the brush hairs coming off onto the wet puzzle, and it's annoying to try and pick them off a gluey surface."
5,Hasbro Liquid Puzzle Saver Glue,"I tried this glue based on the reviews I read. I used the glue on a large glow in the dark puzzle. I did the front side twice, back side once and still had a little left. The little brush did not bother me like I read in some reviews, it just took a little longer to apply. The puzzle looked great after the glue dried and we framed it & hung it up. Our grand daughter was so excited when she saw her master piece hanging on the wall. Thank you for a great product, it was worth the extra money."
4,puzzle glue,"it is as expected - I think I will need more bottles of it to cover my large puzzle ---- ok, now I have used it on 2 medium to large puzzles, and it worked very well - then I used on larger still, and it's ok but needs more coats - I bought more, other brand at walmart, cheaper - still nothing wrong with the first bottle"
1,dissatisfied,I just received my puzzle glue in the mail and its going back .. i havent even tried the glue although from past use I already know it is a good product .. I just paid [...] for ONE little bottle of glue .. absolutely unacceptable .. the stuff sells for 5 bucks a bottle .. I thought I was getting 4 or 5 bottles for 25 bucks NOT 1 .. will NOT use this company again
2,A story that never takes off...,I bought this book to take on a trip because of the gorgeous cover picture and intriguing book flap description. I was hoping for something more dynamic and challenging but the story and characters never really come to life. I would recommend this novel to readers who want a sugery dose of sappy fluff.
1,If you want to read a bad book....,"Wrong in constructions, use of the language, presentation of carachters, details such as the celebration of New Years Eves after Jan. 29 are part of this book that mix the rality of the puertorrican society of the first part of the 20 century with the absurds misconceptions of the writter. If someone wants to have superficial, cosmetics and simple ideas of the socio political situacion of Puerto Rico, this is the book to read."
2,"Unless you're a hardcore programmer, don't buy this one.","I'm new to programming and, while I had some difficulty understanding the concepts within this title, I would not recommend this to anyone that's less than an intermediate level programmer. As opposed to titles that take you through the entire process of creating a website start to finish, this mostly introduces new concepts that help to build on your knowledge of ActionScript 2.0.If you're wishing to feel a sense of accomplishment after reading this title cover-to-cover, you will be sorely disappointed. The sample exercises show how key concepts can enhance your web site/applications/scripts, but there is no end result that allows you to sit back and feel that you've accomplished anything substantial.Any newbie to Flash wishing to increase their knowledge of ActionScript 2.0 should first learn how to create their own fully functional website using some ActionScript before tackling this book."
2,Proofreading unleashed,"I am new to programming and I'm finding that this book does a good job overall in leading me through new concepts. There are, however, an absolutely unacceptable number of typos and grammatical errors in this book. I doubt that it was proofread even once by the author or editor.Here's a good example:(from p.351)""But not every listener event in components is as easy as this one, but in general, you can use the event name, in the above case ""click"", and add ""Handler"" to it to create a call-back.""You don't have to know anything about programming to see that there are so many things wrong with that sentence that the mind simply has nothing to grasp hold of. Learning to program is difficult enough without having to muddle through such garbage.I hope SAMS shows more respect for its readers and customers in the future."
4,Hair,"Proves my theory that Hollywood runs 10 years behind. This anti-war piece was passe when it came out. It is still a great film with music from the Age of Aquarius. Hippies revel in peace and love. They befriend a soldier and drive west to see him. We envy their freedom as they drive through the desert singing ""Good Morning, Starshine."" Berger takes the soldier's place on the base so the soldier can have time with his girl. Berger is whisked away to Vietnam and killed. We are shown his grave in a veterans cemetery. The mindlessness of Vietnam is driven home by a powerful conclusion."
3,Fun,"Silly but fun, the songs will get stuck in your head for days. While not as good as the stage versions it is still worth seeing for any lover of musicals."
5,Favorite Movie Ever,This is one of my all time favorite movies ever. No extras but that's ok because the movie is just so timeless.
5,hair-movie,The movie was real good & specially the music. I was young when the movie originally came out. So if u were young then u will love it more now. It will bring back some good memories
5,one of my favorite musicals,"this is one of my favorite musicals, my favorite seen is when they crash the party,i read a review here, that someone hated this seen, i loved it, ""i got life' fantastic, treat wiliams is great , i havent seen him in a better role, i love every song , but my faves are ""hair"", ""let the sunshine in"" you will dance and sing when you see it, i reccomend this film for everyone, but probably 40 years old or older would appreciate it more,enjoy,""let the sunshine in"" people"
2,Bad Quality,I grew up in the '60s-'70s so I know the show. This story was fun but the quality of the DVD was just awful. We thought it might be a copy...made from an old VHS. It was that bad. The sound quality was worse. Also purchased Jesus Christ Superstar which was much better quality. Amazon...you need to check this DVD!
4,Ready for another generation,"We showed this movie to our young daughters last night. Prompted by a growing sense of anti-war feelings we're experiencing with the daily reports of growing death tolls in Iraq, we felt it was appropriate. They were rapt. I think it was primarily the music and Twyla Tharp's choreography; however, the girls asked a lot of questions, and I think it gave them a little better understanding of what many teenagers felt during the Viet Nam War.The movie version of this story is a worthy effort, made great by Milos Forman. The quality is not as I remembered it back when I saw it in the movie theater in 1980. And while our expectations of quality may have changed, our expectations of a good, entertaining film have not. Hair has grown into another generation of viewers who can appreciate it on many levels. It's worth another look."
4,"""Hair"" is a musical triumph!","I only watched this movie because I heard the main song from it, and was extremely curious how that could be a movie. So I went to my local video store to rent it, but they didn't have it. So I special ordered it. I can only say the movie is worth much more than what I payed. First off, the music is brilliant. The movie also seems to poke fun at certain stereotypes. It really is a classic."
4,"good, but not enhanced for widescreen TVs, should be out on Blu-Ray","Good songs, though Frank Mills is missing from the movie though it is on the movie soundtrack? My only complaint is that it is letter-boxed instead of being enhanced for wide screen which considerably lessens the quality on HD TVs. I want to see it come out on Blu-Ray. Considering the success of the Broadway revival, I think it ought to be redone in an edition that is more closely aligned to the Broadway version. If anyone knows how to move something like this along, please do so."
2,"In a movie called HAIR, couldn't they have found Treat Williams a better wig?","I realize that this movie was filmed when the Age of Aquarius was long gone, but still, Treat Williams' wig was TERRIBLE. It was so awful that it's all I remember about this movie!"
2,Hippies In Curlers . . .,"What a long strange trip it's been. Barely ten years after its original theatrical run, Hair was brought to the screen by people who either hadn't seen it, didn't like it or just didn't get it or the themes it explored. Director Milos Forman apparently missed the 1960s entirely (or saw them exclusively through the lens of Soviet oppression and student demonstrations in Eastern Europe) and he seems to think that David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust and Peter Frampton were hippies. Treat Williams is a surprisingly good singer and dancer and quite good in the role of Berger but the film just misses the point - socially, politically and (perhaps most importantly of all) musically. The whole thing comes across as a put on and proof of the silliness of the counterculture."
2,Not better late than never.,"Hair was a classic case of something coming along too late.If the movie had been releasaed in the late sixties or early seventies, it would have been supersuccessful.Regretfully, by the time it was released, 1979, everything it was about (the Vietnam War, the peace movement, even long hair) had become yesterday's news.As a result, it floundered."
4,About the DVD transfer,"This DVD provides both a ""Standard"" and ""Widescreen"" version. (The Standard is actually a full frame composition, with more detail at top and bottom of frame. But the Widscreen is still well composed, and having seen the film theatrically, I suspect it probably represents what theatergoers saw.)Standard may have had a slight edge in audio quality(?) and, as noted, contains more vertical detail - but it was struck from a muddy print. However, Widescreen was struck from a pristine print - I wondered if it was remastered, it was that beautiful. Comparing scenes from both sides to the VHS transfer I also own, I found Standard was visually indistinguishable from the VHS transfer, but Widescreen was vastly superior - finely detailed, richly colored. Thrilled to finally own a clean copy of one of my favorites."
3,Not quite up to its promise,"Hair is a interesting video, not great but reasonably entertaining. Hair does an adequate job of holding the viewers attention although well short of captivating viewer attention"
2,Disappointed but I watched the whole thing.,"Since I grew up in the 60's I remember the time very well and this film glorifies some things that I remember as being heard of but questionable. The film is rated PG and I disagree with that, there is full frontal female nudity and other scenes with nudity. It makes drug abuse (LSD) and the loose lifestyle look apealing and there is a reason that the hippie/drug culture died out. The life style killed many and the rest grew up and realized that their protest were being ignored because of their zany behavior. The African American people depicted in the film are somewhat realistic but there are a couple songs that are offensive in language. I watched/ bought the film because I remembered some of the songs and wanted to see what the story was. It ends sadly and unrealistically like the rest of the film. Not worth the time unless you are really bored."
1,OH WHAT A SHAME!,"One of the best musicals ever; a sing of friendship, freedom, an excellent original music an stage work; and an incredible bad film.I think the worst adaptation ever made.In stage is 3 hours long, the end is different, the message is different, the songs are different !everything is different!Please: Miss it and go to the original one.P.D.- It's my personal favour, I directed the Original Cast in 1979 in Spain. I really know what I'm saying. Thanks for your patiente."
1,Bad Hair Day,"First off let me exclude Beverly D'Angelo from everything you are about to read. She is in my opinion one of if not the most talented actress/singers there ever was.....period! She is as always flawless. So here we go. As far as watching this movie ever again.....not if they held a gun to my head. Bad acting, bad directing, bad cinemetography, bad script, bad dance (can we call them dance) numbers, hense bad coreography, bad sound, bad politcal statement, in short a ""Bad Hair Day""! A waste of film. Deserves to be in the dollar bin. Buy it and throw the DVD away and just keep the plastic box. It is the only thing in the package that has any value. A stinker!"
1,Garbage - One for the Dump,"I can't believe someone had the nerve to recommend this movie to me of all people. I'm not so easily persuaded by the theme of this movie or from the hippy movt in general; a bunch of brain-dead idiots with long hair who talk about ""love"" is not all it takes to sway me. Love and freedom are not actualized without responsibility. Hippies are about as responsible as a mama cat with a bullseye painted on her and surrounded by a pack of wolves. Sitting on the ground and mooching off of others while talking about love and freedom is nothing more than madness. This movie is garbage, rather than watching it I recommend that you check out a book called, ""Acid Dreams by Martin A. Lee,"" if you want to get the best and the worst of the real story. After seeing hippies as a gullible people who ""tuned out"" from harmony with the cosmos, I can no longer see them in the same light as I did before. They are of no use to me or to anyone else. 0 stars and not recommended at all."
4,Good show,Maybe I'm showing my age but this show was one of the greats of its days. This is a good production and worth watching
2,Kings of Albion,"This didn't work for me: talky yet devoid of character, low on tension, reading like an overly detailed travelogue. The narrator was so lacking in personality that I kept forgetting who he was."
2,Usual negative medieval stereotypes,"This could have been a great book - the idea of seeing medieval England throguh the eyes of foreigners from a distant and more advanced civilisation is a good one, but the author falls back on the traditional stereotypes of the Middles Ages - stupid violent knights, thicko peasants speaking in 'Mummerset' accents, filth and ignorance etc. etc. In makes you wonder why someone is drawn to write about a period and people that he clearly despises so much. One to avoid."
4,Great Resource,"This is a well written and well authenticated genealogical book on the Lovejoy family. Enjoyed it and found it most useful. The only negative was the book is a photocopy and a paperback. It will not stand up to much use. Also the photographs and copies of letters, etc., were of poor quality because it is a photocopy of probably a photocopy. Some photos are almost indisguishable."
2,Apex = disappointment!,"I purchased an Apex dvd player last summer. It worked good for awhile, then the dvd door would not open. Also, if you rent dvds this player is not for you, about any marking on a dvd will cause the dvd to freeze. I only had my player for around 9 months, and didn't use it all that much and it up and quit on me last week. So, I'd say if you're looking for a good cheap dvd player look elsewhere. Apex makes junk!"
1,Door won't open,I bought two of these last year. The unit I bought for my mom was used sparingly. Now the door won't open.
4,Nice DVD on early Maiden and the rest of the NWOBHM,Ok this Dvd is great if you are a fan of the NWOBH. I can only give it 4 stars though because there was only a brief mention of Venom with no clips of them. Also only a quick piece on Diamond Head who are one of the great bands of this era. They even say in the dvd that they should have made it big like Maiden so why the brief clip on them? lastly No mention of Holocaust which to me is a staple of the NWOBHM. Everyone into this genre has the Nightcomers and Live Hot Curry and Wine. What about Raven? Overall it is a great documentation on this great era in metal and a must have for all NWOBHM lovers.
1,Another U.S. label ripoff,"When the UK reissued MR FANTASY last year, it contained the stereo and mono versions of the album. When it hits the U.S., you're forced to buy two different cds to get basically the same single disc (several of the tracks are carry-overs from the UK reissues of TRAFFIC & JOHN BARLEYCORN). In the end, to have all three releases, you'll have to purchase four separate discs! This is why I buy imports, they come out earlier, and are usually better deals both price wise and in content. Compare the versions and you'll see what I mean. As for the music contained here - BRILLIANT! One of the top twenty psych albums of the 60's."
3,Was good way back when,Most songs on this album are psychedelic curiosities. Many songs lack the melody and tunefulness that Steve and the gang can produce in droves. I liked this album when I was in college and was exploring all sorts of late sixties albums and...lots of other things. Many of those albums from the era did hold up over time. This one doesn't.
2,Amazon gets a low mark,"As Amazon has done before, it fails to disclose that this CD is recorded on MONOphonic sound.I wish they would be more up-front about this intrinsically inferior sound; perhaps its just part of their business model.Anyway, I suggest giving them feedback about their failure to disclose such basic facts"
1,Awful Digital Sound !,"This review refers to the 180g vinyl edition , released on the Vinyl Lovers label .I bought this album on vinyl because the remastered cd has a terribly compressed digital sound , only to discover that this album has been mastered directly from the cd and also has that awful digitally compressed sound , which defeats the object of buying the vinyl to hear this record in it's original glorious analogue sound .Vinyl Lovers might be the name of the record label , but do they really love the sound of vinyl , as all of their releases on vinyl have been directly mastered from the digital cd releases ( including the bonus tracks ) , and all sound terrible .It makes buying vinyl from this record label pointless !"
3,Mr. Fantasy by Traffic,"Songs include: Side One - 1. Paper Sun 2. Dealer 3. Coloured Rain 4. Hole in My Shoe 5. No Face, No Name and No Number 6. Heaven is in Your Mind. Side Two - 1. House for Everyone 2. Berkshire Poppies 3. Giving to You 4. Smiling Phases 5. Dear Mr. Fantasy 6. W3're a Fade, You Missed This.Artists: Jim Capaldi (drums, percussion and vocals). Steve Winwood (organ, guitar, piano, bass guitar, harpsichord and vocals). Chris Wood (flute, saxophone, organ, percussion and vocals)."
4,Trippy n' groovy,"This cd is a combination of the U.K. release (mono) and the U.S. (stereo) release of Mr. Fantasy. Very psychedelic in the likes of Sgt. Pepper etc. but also has some jazz funk moments as in track 10 'Giving to you"".If you like Steve Winwood you will get a huge kick out of this album as it was cut prior to his joining up to form the Spencer Davis Group. A worthwhile purchase."
1,Celluloid Crap! (This is not the TV show!!!),"If I could give it less than one star it would still not be few enough to rate this movie. I would rather watch Barney all day long then have an all day marathon of the wiggles than watch this $12 piece of crap again. I wouldn't even make somebody I absolutely hate watch this movie.Enough ranting here is why I hate it so much.The plot:A cheating husband gets a bottle of experimental fluid flung into his face. Then body parts start to fall off and come to life. Then he uses his body parts to get back at his girlfriend who did this to him.Now as awesome as this sounds (The reason we bought it) it is the worst execution I have ever seen in all the hundreds of awful movies I have watched, and I am one of those people that goes out and buys those hundred movie collections.Everything about this movie reeked. I wish I could get a hold of all copies of this movie and use them as clay pidgeons."
3,"An ""OK"" Game - Guesstures","I actually thought this game was going to be pretty fun. It looked cool, and it looked like charades which is a game I've always liked. The problem was that 1) The dirrections weren't clear 2) The board where you are supposed to keep track of your points doesn't erase well 3) You need a lot of people to play. I have four people in my family, and with only four people this game isn't much fun to play. I have only played this game twice and I got it for Christmas about 2 years ago. The first time we played it was when I got it (my whole family was there so we had enough people) and the second time we (tried) to play was about a year ago, with just my family, it wasn't any fun with only 4 people! With enough people this game could be fun, but it just isn't worth it...playing charades without all this fancy stuff is much easier and more fun!"
5,Wow! Excellent!,"Wow! I am glad to see this game again. My sister's rich spoiled friend had this game and she and the four of us bros and sis's played this game at our house(I was the woungest-12-and the oldest was 16). This is an excellent game for people 12 and up- you might just be playing it forever if you can keep it together. Oh yah, and I was much smarter after the game was done, and it was great learning to communicate with my team(even tho they were mean somewhat because I was the youngie). Get it peeps!P.S.: this is a high class game- sophisticated and exciting!"
5,Marvelous Game!,"This is a fabulous game to enjoy in group settings. We have had so much fun because people get really creative and ingenious ""dramatizing"" the unknown word the other players have to guess. The game is very similar to Pictionary, but you have to dramatize instead of draw. Perfect for witty and funny people. Not too good for shy ones."
3,Not good enough,"This is a fun party game, but it's only good for about a half-hour. For a really super evening with friends, I prefer games like Rigamarole and Cranium that have a variety of different activities (including games like Gestures) that really get the conversation and the laughs going."
5,never knew there were so many ways to act out the words!,This game is a total blast to have when you're having friends over and you've run out of things to talk about! Recommend this game to anyone who enjoys charades and likes to have fun!
1,OLD TAG SALE WORTHY,Honestly this wasnt worth the price. It was old dusty and not even fully functional. Has tape to hold it together.. I wouldve paid @ $2.50 for this in a tag sale had i known it would come from an Amazon seller in this condition. Down to crayon on the instructions.. VERY VERY disappointed.. I even started getting fradualent credit card charges after this purchase and makes me think it was this seller.. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Great family fun,We're having a ton of fun with this game. I remember it from when I was younger. Now my 8 & 10 year old are playing too. It's a barrel of laughs and a great time!
3,Not as fun as I thought it would be,We had fun playing it but could have been better. Maybe it was just the crowd we had going to give it a few more parties before I make my inal decision.
3,trying to hard to forget who they are,"one or two of the songs are all you need to hear to judge the album, they do have talent, but i think that they need to go back to the early years of their music making to find what it's all about. you should of heard jason sing 5 or 6 years ago, josh is getting to be quite the drummer though. look forward to what is next."
3,Typical ragga swagga.. I really was expecing another Shottas on this one,"Yeah.. some good songs on this. But nothing like what I heard on Juelz Santana's song ""Shottas"". That song was fire. Nothing like that on this. But hey, still was an enjoyable listen. Spliff sparking is optional fool."
4,Sizzla fan,"I have been a fan of Sizzla's since the mid 90's and prefer his vocal (singing) records to the the djing, this album reminded me of why I love Sizzla. I appreciated the old school tracks. In my opinion there were no major flaws with this album, this is one that I could listen to straight through. A personal favorite, track #9: Lately i've been thinking.Bless"
2,OK,Ok the monkey in a barrel were okay I saw them for much more less at a local walmart but didnt want to go through the hassle of returning them. Not enough monkey for the price.
4,Fun for my kid,I remember these from when I was a kid. Same now as they were then...and kids still have fun with them.
2,"Beware, may not be red","My 18 month old grandson loves Toy Story 3. One of his favorite parts is the barrel of monkeys. I ordered a red barrel of monkeys, like the ones in the movie, but I received a green one. I am so disappointed. I'm not sure he'll make the connection. It is too close to Christmas to return it. Since receiving it I've discovered that colors are sent out randomly. As of this writing, there is no way to specifically buy a red one on Amazon."
4,A Battery is A Battery .....,"I've had four different cell phones with the same company, and for some reason the batteries that came with these phones didn't come close to the rated standby and talk times. In fact, the one that came with my current phone drops in power after less than 24 hours of standby time. I don't know, maybe they put used batteries with their new phones.But this one bought from Amazon for the Audiovox 9100 phones (9155 is the one it's being used in), comes closest to the published rated useage times.Maybe amazon has a good batch in their inventory."
3,Not bad,"It is not a bad book. You should admire that the author wanted to make the world a better place by teaching about being inventive. Although, in my opinion, I find that the author has a bit of ego telling the world he has invented this and that. I don't find anything ego about creating a more safer aircraft, but the other example I do find it to be bragging. The author suggestion about being inventive doesn't seem new, it just that most people doesn't seem to notice it yet.I don't actually recommand that you buy this book on how to be inventive.However, if you wanted a few funny story, then by all means, buy this book."
1,Young mom,"First off what is wrong with people that they need to show different positions you can have sex in to your kids??? Really your kids need to know that? My mother showed us a book that showed mommy and daddy having sex under the covers which is fine but they don't need to know that mommy can be on top or bottom or upside down. Why don't you just show them everything else that you can do as well since you obviously think that those pictures are fine!!! I'm not a prude but some of these people who think it's ok well just stay away from my kid. Those are the kids I knew in high school that screwed everyone and their parents let it happen (fully aware) not caring. Guess what, they all got pregnant in high school, never getting their high school diploma nor anything above a high school degree! Now they live with their parents with more kids. What a life... For a school to let a teacher read this well lets say I hope that never happens at my kids school or all hell with break loose!"
3,"funny, silly supplement for introduction to reproduction","I can't believe the horrible reviews I've seen of this book. Lighten up a little people. I'm a conservative person, but I'm not repressed. This book isn't a good introductory explanation of reproduction; instead it's a silly and cute supplement for a child who already knows the basics. The parents in the book tell their children just about every old wives' tale you've heard about where children come from. The pictures show babies being mixed out of sugar and spice and baked in an oven, babies growing in pots like plants, etc., with very funny illustrations. Then the children turn around and tell their parents how reproduction really takes place. My only problem with the book is that it doesn't use the correct terms for the anatomy and instead uses ""seed,"" ""seed pod,"" and ""tube."" I would use this more as a humorous supplement than as a basic learning tool."
1,Read BEFORE you buy! INAPPROPRIATE,"I read this book for one of my classes in college. It is shocking to know that any family would allow their children to read a book like this. I might let an 8th grader read this book for sex education purposes, but a 4 year old? Our society has problems!There are graphic sexual illustrations that would make most adults uncomfortable. Please, for the sake of your children, read this book before you buy!"
1,I can't believe this book was printed!,"I was disgusted when I read this book! One could very easily pick this up and start reading it to a child or a child pick it up and start looking at the pictures because the illustrations at the beginning of the book appear to be very innocent and cute!A few pages into the book, one discovers very graphic and detailed crayon drawings of anatomically correct males and females and how their parts fit together and even positions in which they can fit together. This book should be snatched from all library and bookstore shelves. It's intent could be nothing more than to ... children's innocent minds. I believe in ... education for children, but this is going a little too far!!"
3,A good starting p;oint for 6 yr olds and up,"Some of the reviewers for this book need to relax. If they are so uptight about a children's book about sex, I'd hate to see just how uptight they are about the subject matter itself. As if there is only one way to explain subject...as there is only one way to have sex. I pity their kids.When I bought this book, just for myself, I laughed out loud at how hysterically ingenious the author/illustrator pops the pompasity of sex into something understandable and ...funny.It is non-judgemental, approachable and funny.Relax and enjoy."
2,Mommy Laid An Egg,"I returned this book. It was so silly that it was confusing for my 4 year old who needed real answers. The information is incorrect in it. Babies do not pop out of Mommys. A much better book was ""So That's How I was born"" or for Christian families ""How Did God Make Me."""
1,Don't buy this book,This is the only review I've ever written. I just had to let people know that I don't think it's helpful for children to learn about sex by looking at drawings of their parents making love suspended by balloons or riding on a skateboard.
1,"Not appropriate for young children, poor explanations","This book is a wolf in sheep's clothing. If you are planning to use it to educate your child about sex, don't buy this book. It uses untrue old wives tales and then uses improper terminology for the reproductive organs when it does attempt to explain the truth about the subject. If you are planning to buy it to read to your 4-8 year old, don't. It has graphic cartoon-like depictions of clowns engaging in sexual intercourse using various sexual positions such as on a skateboard and suspended in the air by helium balloons. I personally want my child to realize that sex is for grown-ups. I also don't want them thinking how fun it would be to try it on a skateboard. Sex should be a serious matter to parents since sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy are serious. Censorship? No. We rate movies PG-13, why not books? If you want to give your child good, truthful and respectful information about sex, find a better author.Jennifer in FL"
1,appalling,"I'm surprised this book isn't banned. I'm not a prude or religious at all and believe children should learn about sex. But there's a limit to what they should know and how they should be taught. There are many other, more civilised, ways to bring up the subject. Babette Cole brings up very inappropriate subjects for kids with very inappropriate illustrations. If you think this book is shocking, try reading ""Mummy Never Told Me"", by the same auther."
1,Highly Inappropriate and Graphic!,"I am an Elementary Principal for grades 3-5 and am responsible for teaching 5th grade students ""Developing Years"", which is our sex education class. ""Mommy Laid an Egg"" is THE most inappropriat book I have ever seen for children. The pictures on page 21-22 about ways in which ""mommies and daddies fit together"" are outrageous. There are four pictures of what amounts to sexual positions. I am not sure if the author is trying to teach about how babies are made or how to have sex. If you want your children to ask you how you made them and are ready to explain what position you used, then this is the book for you. If you are a responsible parent buy a different book!"
2,Problem with slingback strap,"The shoes are so pretty. The problem is that the slingback strap is too big, so even the shoe fits you well, it's not well adjusted to your foot/ankle and it's loose when you walk. It's a shame because they are really nice shoes."
5,Book review,My son really enjoyed the book and the compilation of kid mysteries. It is a great tool for stimulating the idea that reading is important and fun.
3,Too hard!!,The mysteries are cool. ( This is why I gave it 2 stars.) There are ten of them in the book. When you are done reading the mysteries they ask you how Encyclopedia Brown figured it out. You can never figure them out. They don't give you enough info. This makes it not very fun! Don't try the other books. They all have the same problem. Just don't waste your money. ( I gave the one star for trying.)
4,Effective Rodent Control,"Well designed and inconspicuous. Only a rat or mouse could get through the maze to eat the bait. The bait is secured with metal rods, which prevents the rodent from carrying it outside the trap, where a pet could eat it. I placed peanut butter on the bait, which I understand is irresistible to rats and mice. It killed the rats. The problem: dead rats under my house that smelled for a week. It's a trade-off to handling traps and dead rats. Use gloves and masks when cleaning and re-baiting the trap."
3,Remember the Rats have to die somewhere.,"Just remember if the rats are living in walls and roof of your home, that's where they will probably die. Make sure the rats can no longer get into your house before you use bait outside. Its better to use traps inside once the house is sealed, because once you stop catching them, you know they are gone. Also, unless you change the environment that attracted the rats to begin with, they will be back eventually. Your local Vector Control Agency is the best place to go for info on getting rid of rats the right way."
3,"Yes, Rob, It Didn't Blow","Yeeees, dude, it was better than I thought it'd be and all anima isn't ""cartoon level"" so there, I admitted it in a public place. ;-) Besides, you knew I didn't really think these types of films truly had no value, I was joking. Don't you remember I said Princess Mononoke was ""mostly OK""?Um, hi, everybody. Uh, yeah, this Teito Monogatari is a good movie and I think it's worth the money. Time travel, spiritualism, earthquakes, anti-westernism versus pro-traditionalism, widescale monster-based destruction, yup, it's got it all. Go, Toei Studios!Ahem."
1,"WHAT A JOKE, DON'T BUY THIS","No Japanese audio Track, Horrible Dub, Lame Plot, boring Animation, dumb story line, bad ending. This has got to be the worst anime I have ever scene since Ninja Resurrection and Kimera. If you love Ninja Scroll and Dragon Ball Z, then you are going to hate this!!!"
4,"Liked it, But.....","It was a good video, but for some reason I can't put my finger on, it just didn't hit big with me. I really liked it when the villian finally realized the true nature of his rival. That was great. I still susgest getting this one."
5,Ernie Kovacs,A treat for anyone who loves comedy and remembers Ernie. He was the most creative man in television to this day. His antics are timeless and priceless.Any material with Ernie Kovacs is profound. Too bad they didn't give him a bigger budget to work with.
5,"A ""lost"" classic...","I can't believe this record is 18 years old! A lost classic...one of the finest American pop records of the last twenty years...original, dark, and lovely lyrics which vascillate between themes like death and love with effortless elegance..."
4,ANTHROPOPHAGY SAVES THE DAY...,"This is an interesting account of the tragic plane crash in the Andes mountains in October 1972, which saw forty five people go down with the plane, many of them members of a Uruguayan rugby team. Of those forty five, ultimately sixteen would come off the mountain alive, but it would not come to pass until they had spent approximately seventy horrific days and nights trapped in unforgiving and alien territory high in the Andes mountains.This book recounts for the reader the travails of those trapped in this remote and inaccessible place, as well as the faith that helped see them through their horrific ordeal. A few of the photographs in the book are a little shocking, as they show the remains of the survivors' anthropophagy. They did, however, what they had to do in order to survive. It is definitely an amazing story. It makes one ask of oneself, ""What would I have done under the same circumstances?"" Read the book to see if you can answer that question."
4,Delicious tea,"This is a deliciously flavored tea. The cinnamon and apple flavors are not over-powering, but definitely add something special to the black tea."
1,someone who knows the artist,"This man is a total farse. None of the credentials he has listed about himself are true. To learn more about this grifter go to [the worldflutes website]The music on his CDs are most likely pirated as the CD that came along with his book ""How to play kena"" was an exact copy of a CD that he owned (and did not take in any way create). The artists that did perform/wrote this music are not getting the recognition that they deserve for their work."
2,Here's One You Can Do Without,"What could have been a truly ""great"" book turned out to be such a disappointment ! This book is a collection of average-mediocre hot rods with only a small sampling of ""great"" rods.There is only one picture of each car--no detail photographs (the description of the car might say what kind of engine the car has but if the car has a hood who knows what the engine looks like). Additionally the descriptions are rather brief and boring.Actually that best describes this book----BORING !"
3,Yes it's LIVE! That's what makes it different...,"Despite what ""A music fan from NH"" may say, this is not a bad album if you are a fan of AFOS. All these songs are already available on their previous recordings. Check the Track Listings. If you never had the opportunity to listen to this Big 80's band live, here is your chance. It does sound like a ""bootleg"" where the microphone was taped to an audience member's lapel. Its not going to win any audiophile awards, but that's the appeal of this CD and for the price, I think its a bargain!"
5,I was looking for a tasty treat and this is a tasty treat!!!!!!!,"My buddy and I, LeCreme Collin, listened to this live album 5 times in one evening while watching the movie Spaceship 2 (Flight From Oakview). We did each others hair up to look just like Mike Score's, but Paul Reynolds (the genius Flock guitarist/dancer) would laugh at us if he saw how we permanently messed our hair up. I just hope I don't get fired from my job. Anyway, this is a great fun live album. Go git it."
1,"Great Movie, Awful Blu-ray...","There is a review here on Amazon called ""Great Movie, Awful DVD"" by J Badgley, and absolutely nothing has changed with the release of the Blu-ray - Horrible grainy picture with scratches and light variances throughout. You think they might have remastered or cleaned up the picture for Blu-ray a little? Nope. Everyone agrees this is a great animated tail (er, tale)... but stick with an old DVD (or VHS even!). BTW, the soundtrack is in DTS, but only 2 channel(?!) and EXTREMELY LOUD. Not pleasant to listen or watch."
5,Nostalgic,Remember it as a kid? It's just as good as an adult. You can almost smell the pizza hut pizza and hostess cakes when you watch it.
4,"Great film, mediocre transfer.","This is a great movie, Bluth's best in my opinion (by far). It's unfortunate that the studio couldn't spring for a properly cleaned up transfer to make the Blu Ray really shine, but I'm just happy to have a somewhat decent version, flaws and all. It's also really cheap.Ignore the horrid Saturday morning style cartoon cover art and see this movie!"
4,"IT""S ABOUT TIME IT CAME TO BLU RAY!",Well... It only took for ever for this movie to come to blu ray. sure it'll still have fake windscreen and so-so special features. but it'll be great to watch it in hd in the first place!
2,Brisby Boo-Boo,"What is with this film? I was excited about this movie because I had just read the book and thought it would be just as good. It isn't. Parents, if your kids are old enough to read, have them read the book, not watch the movie. Besides, which would you rather have them do, read or sit in front of the tube? The book is Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH."
2,disturbing stereotype of scientists!,"I use this film for a psychology and film graduate class I teach -- as an example of films that portray researchers (especially psychologists) as evil. Is this what we want to teach our children? NIMH stands for National Institute of Mental Health: There was research on rats, many years ago, to see if RNA from one rat could make an injected rat ""smarter"" (ie maze bright). Obviously the needles used were not twice as large as the rats, as in Secret of NIMH! This film portrays the scientists as evil and the ""poor little caged animals"" as tortured. It is an irresponsible presentation."
5,DON BLUTH'S MASTERPIECE,"Yes, I consider SON to be Mr. Bluth's magnum opus. The main reson I bought this on DVD disc I downloaded it on Netflix but want a phisical copy. Over the years I owned SON on BETA and VHS. After I downloaded it,there was a political undertone that I missed as a child. Namely classism. The only problom I have with the dvd is the kiddie artwork on the cover. It screams Disney Film all over."
1,not for kids,perfect movie if you want your kids to have nightmares for the next 3 weeks. Mental health images were quite disturbing.
1,NIMH - DVD vs Novel,"I first read the Rats of NIMH at school , in London around 1985. I loved it and it has been with me ever since, especially the part about what happened to the rats in NIMH. 25 years later, as a primary school teacher myself, I reread the book with my class. I finally got my hands on the DVD and watched it with them when we finished the book.What a disappointment! Never has Hollywood sugar coated a story more pitifully than in the Secret of NIMH. Its great if you are 5 years old and want to see goodies and baddies running around with magic stones and slap stick humour. You could liken it to a Tom and Jerry cartoon. The sequence about NIMH itself was glossed over in seconds - the crux of the book!The characterisation was ludicrous and the narrative boring. Id be happy to send this to anyone, for free! Just get in touchRegardJemstar"
1,Don't waste your time!!!,"This movie was awful. I'm not criticizing the animation, which was above par, but the story is nothing like that of the book. After reading the ""Secret of Nimh"" I wanted my 5 year-old to see the movie. Big mistake. The book is much better. The movie plot was changed substantially and instead of ""smart"" rats we now have ""magic"" rats. If you want a wonderful story read the book and its subsequent sequels written by the original author's daughter. If you want scary, far-fetched, science fiction go ahead, waste your time with this film."
1,wow,"Wow, how can you people say this is a good movie?!?!Ever read the book, it makes this movie look like crap on the side of the road that's days old.It is kinda based on the book, which is awesome, and it leaves out some characters and it's bad don't listen to what others said about it, read the book and screw the movie!"
5,5 Stars for Don Bluth's finest animated feature,"When this film was released in 1982, I was only 5 years old. Adults may say this film is a bit too frightening at times for children, and I agree. However, having been a child that experienced this film in the theater, the best way to see it, it is something completely different. This is a story for children, and although the story has it's more dramatic moments, it is portrayed in a way only children can understand. I laughed during the funny scenes and gazed wide-eyed at the serious ones. When it was over I left and went on to adulthood. This film has been with me and it still invokes similar reactions as it became a part of my childhood. I am purchasing this DVD to add to my collection, and I will enjoy it all over again. Reliving ones childhood is truly a wonderful thing, and it makes for a happier person and a more fulfilled adult. I hope you find this review helpful and share in the joy and magic of animation."
2,"Great movie, awful DVD","This movie has intense sentimental value to me, since I grew up with it as a child. When I discovered is was available on DVD I lept for joy and quickly baught it. However my joy has quickly fallen to disapointment. This is a pathetic DVD, no better then the VHS, from which I think it was transfered. Pan & Scan with a stereo audio track. The film is extreemly grainy and full of scratches. MGM is notorious for making horrible DVDs, and this is a classic example. Secret of NIMH isn't that old of a movie, I find it hard to believe they couldn't find an original print to do a good transfer from, rather then just copying the VHS. I sincerely hope they reevaluate this release and give us a remastered widescreen version in the future."
4,Finally a widescreen version of N.I.M.H.,"I have no quarrel with the quality of this Widescreen version on DVD; it looks beautiful and sounds great. Having said all that, I have no idea why 20th Century Fox released it on 2-discs, other than to jack up the price. For that reason I am giving it a grade of only 4 stars, even though the film deserves 5 stars.Disc One contains the feature with audio commentary. Disc Two has a 15 minute Making Of featurette and six games for children. The theatrical trailer was not included. All the information on Disc Two would have easily fit on Disc One with room left over for much more.I'll stop complaining now and enjoy the film..."
5,The Best Animated Family Movie ever...,"Besides All Dogs Go To Heaven, this has got to be Don Bluth's best! Filled with magical, exciting, breathtaking animated fun, THE SECRET OF NIMH is truly the best. It tells the tale of a timid mouse named Mrs. Brisby (originally named Mrs. Frisby)who goes in search of someone who can help her. Her son, Timmy is sick with pnemoniua, and only the power of love and bravery can save his life. I fully reccomend this motion picture for the entire family's enjoyment.~Julia, 11"
5,This is a classic to remember forever!,Just buy this movie. I've enjoyed it since childhood. It is quite intriguing for everyone.
5,Secret of NIMH,"This is by far one of the Greatest childrens novels ever written in this time. The Movie really captures what the book was all about. I saw the movie as a young kid and fell in love with the characters. Every child should see this movie without question, even adults. Great Cartoon movie of the 80's, a perfect ten."
5,Wonderful story,"This is one of those classic cartoons that everyone has to see. It got it for my wife who grew up watching this. I had never seen it before but have to say that it is wonderful. A marvellous story, well animated and acted. My son who is 2 found some of it a scarey but thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,EXCELLENT,Great movie from my childhood - just as good as I remember it - and so glad I could now order it as an adult to share with the children in my family!
5,A favorite film always a terrible transfer,"This is a wonderful film and was done in a high tech first class manner. One of the first to have a digital soundtrack. I Just have always loved it. It has been released in DVD, LaserDisc etc. All the same terrible transfer. Children will still enjoy the film as it is a treasure. They release it as a BluRay but it is the same old transfer that was made for VHS. Look at the BlyRay of the 1937 Snow White which is just stunning as Disney took care with the transfer.A well done transfer makes it easier on the eyes - that promotes a ease of viewing."
1,Bluth Needs to Jazz it Up,"I'm in agreement with Tankexmortis below. The DVD provides you NOTHING more than the VHS except format convenience. Considering the effort/money Bluth put towards reviving Dragonslayer and Space Ace, I would've expected this work of art to be digitally remastered with commentary, extras, etc. Don't be fooled by the new cover art. Hopefully, one day, Bluth will remaster the film - it truly deserves it."
3,OOPS!!,"This movie should not be rated G. It's hard to explain to a first grader why the characters say the ""D"" word. I know they hear that on television all the time, but when I buy a G rated movie, I expect no surprises!!"
1,Not Bad...Unless You Want To Watch It,"I only saw this once or twice when I was a kid. It's a bit dark, like I like, which will be a lot of fun. I know that I will watch this over and over and it will be a classic. The only extra that's on the blu-ray is a commentary. I like commentaries, but I really wish they would've have a trailer, at least. Or maybe the making of featurette that was on the 2 disc blu-ray."
1,Where's the movie??,"The 1 star rating isn't about the movie, it's a great movie; it's about the fact that it wasn't released in the original theatrical format. It still boggles me that studios still release films in full frame, don't they realize that it is CHEAPER to release it in widescreen?? No guy panning and scanning the entire film!"
5,Excellent animated feature!,This is one of the best animated features ever made. It's the story of a courageous mouse trying to save her family. With highly imaginative and detailed characters. Most certainly worth your time.
3,"Secret of Nimh , letterboxes","Hello:It would be wonderful if MGM would release Scret of Nimh, in it's original aspect ratio, which was 1:85.It is such a neat animation and it deserves to see the whole picture."
1,Terrible mastering,"This is a great animated tale for all ages, worth many repeated viewings. However, MGM didn't remaster this for hi-def/blu-ray. The result is dull, washed out, muted colors, a very grainy grainy picture with countless white flecks from a poor source print. If you already have the dvd, skip this mess."
4,A Nice Children's Movie,"A lot of the children's movies and shows that come out nowadays are so annoying and not something I can stand to watch. I like this movie a lot and my kids do as well. It doesn't follow very closely to the book though, and that is one thing that kept it from getting a 5 rating. The most annoying thing is that her name is Mrs. Frisby in the book and Mrs. Brisby in the movie."
2,Waiting on a special edition,"I absolutely love this film, words do not suffice... it's a wonderfully acted, subtle, funny animation masterpiece. Which is why the DVD doesn't do it justice. The visual transfer is awful, very grainy/compressed, no real menu options. It would be better if the original widescreen presentation were also available. It's painful when every frame is so painstakingly drawn, to miss what's happening on the edges. This is a great film that has touched several generations. It's unfortunate that MGM doesn't recognize the potential it has to touch people of a broad range of ages. Work of this quality deserves better treatment."
4,Classic - great for kids,"I remember this movie from my childhood and wanted to share it with my children. I will say that I should have previewed it, as it has some violence and some scary parts. There are some great themes (family, love, sacrifice), and clear characters (mother, bad-guy, silly/inept comic-relief-friend) that kids will associate with. The animation has style and feeling, without being saturated or overdone. It is a movie that lived up to my memories & expectations."
1,Shameful!!!!!!,"Amazon has this terrible habit of slapping the DVD reviews on BluRay versions when they are released. Terribly misleading.The review presented here is of the BluRay version of the movie. It is perhaps the worst transfer to BluRay I have even seen. I found it super grainy, too dark in the darker portions of the film. Sometimes it appears to be out of focus. Worst of all, dust specs. Hundreds of dust specs that ""snow"" down on the screen through 50 percent of the movie.The movie is one of my all time favorites. The BluRay version is a disgrace!"
2,Great movie-terrible DVD,"This movie has always been one of my favorites. It was one of the only movies I watched as a kid, on a bootlegged 8mm that I wore out with use. When I saw it on the rack at Blockbuster, I was overcome. What joy! What perfection! What... full screen transfer! Now, I don't know if this movie even had a wide screen version at any point in its life, but I'm assuming it did. And full screen just doesn't do it for me. No extras, no letterboxing, nice liner notes though. I can only hope that they re-release it with some nice character sketches or something. Alas."
4,Dustin Hoffman's best movie,"The acting in this movie is flawless, Dustin Hoffman is at the top of his game. Its the touching story of a man who finds out he has an autistic brother and how his relationship with him helps him learn how to look outside of his own selfish life and pursuits."
4,Wonderful movie,"Barry Levinson has proven again what a fine director he is.RAIN MAN delivers quite a punch as a human drama and sort of a buddy picture, with some humorous moments. It is deeply felt.Tom Cruise is excellent in this movie. Dustin Hoffman is great too.I would definitely recommend this one."
4,A solid film,"This was not my personal favorite, but it is a good film. I've seen better performances by both Hoffman and Cruise, and the direction felt a little slow and sloppy at times, but you have to credit it overall. It's a touching, human story that could have been told a little better."
5,Defintely Defintely a Great Film Defintely,"Rain Man is a very touching film. Dustin Hoffman gives the best performace of his career as Raymond Babbit, a autistic savont, who has inheirted his father's millions, but has no clue of the value of money! Tom Cruise plays Charlie Babbit, Raymond's money-greedy brother. Cruise attends his father's funeral and finds out that he is'nt the receipt of his fathers millions. He then goes to a mental felcility where the ""receipent"" is, but to his suprise he finds out the rightful receipent is his autistic brother he never knew existed. Cruise then ""kidnapps"" Raymond and takes him on a cross-country tripp to get his half of the millions. On the tripp, he learns to understand his brother, and towards the end loves him. A poigant film with great performaces from Cruise and Hoffman."
1,DO NOT waste your money on the Blu-Ray. Buy the DVD,"No remastering, nothing. The quality of the blu-ray rivals that of VHS. I feel completely ripped off. I paid $14 for a movie that I could have purchased as a DVD for $7.50.Otherwise, the movie itself is great........... but you know that already. That's why you're looking to purchase a 23 year old movie."
3,"Touching Story, but.....","The story of the two brothers, that's nice and touching. And Dustin Hoffman, what can you say? He is a brilliant actor. His performance deserved the Oscar. But I lost interest in this movie right around where they stop at the house to watch the game show or whatever TV program it was. It couldn't keep my interest or attention to the end."
3,autism,"autism is actualy very serious and saddening.anyhow,dustin hoffman is supposed to be autistic.his brother tom cruise comes around after many years and takes him away from the home hes in.they drive around for a bit and grow closer.kids wont get it.most adults dont either.you have to have a heart to like this.most people are too condescending to get into this touching tale.its also very emotional in many parts.toms ol lady of course is nicole kidman.shes extremely sexy!tom has many better movies.dustin doesnt.this is one of kidmans worst.as for all these 1000's of jokes that have been going around since this movie came out.i honestly dont know how you can stand to be yourself if you'd make fun of something as serious and hurtful as autism."
1,Read Specs--It's FULL-FRAME...Ewwww!,"What a HORRIBLE release of a GREAT movie...what in the world were they thinking formatting the BLU-RAY release in pan & scan FULL-FRAME?!?!?I was all set to buy this, but luckily checked the specs first! I wasn't even aware any blu-rays were being released in full frame format; now I will have to start double-checking specs on each new blu ray purchase to make sure, just like with the old DVD's...what a downturn in blu-ray tech."
5,Master OF The Rare LASERDISCs Movies.,"Charlie,Charlie Babbitt heh,who Doesn't LIKE RAIN MAN? 'tis A Great Movie Definitely :PP,,I have it on LASERDISC AND I have The SPECIAL EDITION DVD Too,,Give it a try you won't regret it,,Oh,Uh Vern,Oh,Uh V-e-r-n :PPP"
5,Rain Man,this is one of the best movies ive seen. it shows how the most different types of human beings can come together. dustin hoffman gives an extrodinary acting roll in this film. i recomend this movie to everyone
5,Studios used to produce excellent films,"A touching story about coming to terms with money and brotherly love, Rain Man is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's unfortunate that present-day studios can't touch it. Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman deliver career-best performances."
5,A splendid film,"Rain Man is the story of Charlie and Raymond Babbitt, who until the death of their father Sanford, have been separated from each other for much of their lives. Charlie didn't even know that he had a brother until this occasion. Raymond is autistic, and it is the coming together of the brothers that is the narrative of this film, which is highly engaging and entertaining, as they learn more about each other whilst travelling across America by car, to Charlie's home in California. The journey is very much one of discovery, as forgotten events of the past are unraveled and Charlie has to quickly adapt to the needs of Raymond, with patience and understanding. This is the film that confirmed Tom Cruise as a highly capable drama actor, and Dustin Hoffman deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a leading role, for his superb performance as Raymond. It is an enlightening movie that will forever charm audiences.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
4,"Great story, good buy!","Great movie! Kind of slow if you are looking for something for a special date or a night with the guys, but it's a great story, well-made film, and has fabulous actors!"
1,Blu-Ray Review,Amazon has the wrong information. The Movie is 1:85 ratio and the Blu-Ray is terrible quality. This movie deserves better treatment than what MGM gave here.Keep your dvd copy if you have it. No reason to upgrade.
1,"Standard-Def picture! Wait, what?!","What an embarrassment to MGM. I've never seen this before in over 200 Blu-ray discs: the video is simply upconverted standard def. This is appalling, really.Unlike the spec table an other reviews, it is true 16x9 aspect ratio, and DTS sound, along with three commentary tracks.This isn't Amazon's fault, of course. However, maybe our Amazon friends could convey to MGM what a disgrace this product is."
5,Rain Man dvd,"Only good things to say! The dvd was in perfect condition, it arrived sooner than we'd expected. What else can I say? On a somewhat related note, if you haven't seen this movie, watch it. :) Thanks for the ship!"
3,"OK, but really not Best Picture worthy...","I remember when this came out, I thought it was only mediocre, and was surprised when it won Best Picture. Watched it again for the first time since it's original release, and was still disappointed with it."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A fairly middling film lifted out of its mediocrity only by the star power generated by Tom Cruise and a very good Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man is too long, too slow, and too uninteresting to be considered a good movie, much less a classic."
3,1-man show.,"Entertaining story of a guy who really likes *People's Court*. Dustin Hoffman is the autistic savant; Tom Cruise is his jerk brother who unscrupulously runs a high-end auto dealership. Needing funds to make up a shortfall, he attempts to weasel Hoffman out of a considerable inheritance. They go on a long road-trip because Hoffman is afraid to fly (he can quote crash statistics; a very handy source of info, there). They bond; Cruise's character improves, blah blah. Interestingly, though, Hoffman's character doesn't improve -- I feel this is true to life as well as being artistically true. *Rain Man* IS overrated (""Best Picture""? -- Please) but it's not a waste of your time."
3,MORE MATERIAL! please,"This is my favorite movie, and the dvds that I've got so far of this movie are all really empty on extra material. This one;1. The commentaires- Barry, Barry and Ronald. Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman should've had put commentaires on there too. That would be very nice, 'cause the entire movie is about these two guys!2. The deleted scene of them in K-mart, that's very nice and all but hey! ONE?!3. The photogallery. Nothing bad about that.4. The behind the scenes show, great. But I sure hope it's not the one from AMC!So you see, I don't think this has the right to be called a special edition, when there's just a few small changes from the other dvds I've purchased!'COURSE THIS IS DEFINITLY STILL THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER, DEFINITLY!"
1,"Slow, too many holes and unrealistic","So did he get some money at the end? did his business get saved?, did Ray want to really go back to the hospital? no real answers here, why did he get thrown out of the casino anyway? The whole thing about the roulette ball could he really figure it out? I don't know all i know is Tom Cruise is crying at the end that he will go see him in 3 weeks. How long will that last, probably until real life kicks in and he forgets about him like his father did.Did it desearve 4 oscars and best picture. NO would it get acclaim today I highly doubt it. This movie is lame"
5,great,"its a great movie and a fantastic performance by Dustin and even Tom isnt too bad in this one. watch it again,"
5,An interesting truth.,"Having an autistic daugher myself, I found this movie to be on target with real life situations. I laughed, cried, and identified with all the characters! A fabulous movie!"
5,very happy with my video,"I was very happy with my video. It was in very good condition, and it played well.It arrived on time too. I have no complaints."
3,GOOD THING VEGAS IS SOOOOO QUIET!!!!,"nothing is more exhilirating than a Vegas run on the table and the penthouse suite comped... for a super sensory autistic? not so much, but heh, who cares bout that inconsistency when we can see Dustin n Tom making woo in the moonlight of the hotel bedroom... interesting deja vu of Tom's disdain for mental disorders and all ya gotta do is ignore symptoms and life improves dramatically, no meds!!! yeah.... very touching tale of lost love, and heart wrenching compassion for a condition not well known even today... Dustins character interpretation is abs olutely flawless and incomparable... i.e. Forest Gump, Sgt. Slade, etc. well perhaps Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot could possibly compare but high recommend just for this metamorphisis and certainly fondest memories of the Vegas strip of yore...."
5,A GOOD story about brothers,"Comment: This is one of those movies that you kind of stumble into. You have heard about it but forgot what it was you had heard. You see on the box that it is associated with 4 Academy Awards. It's raining (or snowing) outside so you decide to take a chance. Well... buy the end you have a warm feeling inside and you are glad you took the time to see the movie. Dustin Hoffman plays his part ""most excellently"". Tom Cruise plays ""the strait man"" and again ""most excellently"". If you haven't seen this movie, you could do yourself a favor. It is no in your face high tech action movie... just a good story about brothers. A GOOD story about brothers, enjoy."
5,rain,"I still bawl! Again Mr. Cruise has always been my guy. Wonderful movie Oscar winner, well deserved award winning film"
1,Poor quality,This tape was a copy of a copy. Picture quality was very poor. Even a top line VCR did not help. Bootleg quality at best. There was no sound on tape. Good luck !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,It's an ok product to for concoctions.,"I haven't try this oil by itself, but it's a good concoction to mix with other products for hair and body."
3,Too little jasmine for my taste,"I have been drinking jasmine green tea daily for years,succumbing to buying the loose good stuff (read expensive) from coffee/tea shops and am trying to buy a bagged one at home to save money...I love Twinings for it's black teas so I thought I'd give it a whirl. To me it tastes like mostly green tea with a hint--very small hint--of jasmine mostly in the aroma but not in taste. The Stash jasmine tea has a little bit more jasmine flavor but I fear I am going to give up and go back to buying the loose bulk tea and just grit my teeth on the price. And if you're looking for a strong jasmine tea, I love the Silver Canyon loose Jasmine Green Tea out of Boulder, CO."
5,Finally a green tea that really tastes good!,"I've tried several different brands of green teas over the years and I've been sorely disappointed in every one -- they usually have absolutely NO taste at all, barely tint the water a tiny bit of green, and taste like I'm drinking hot water. I've been on a jasmine kick lately and picked up a box of the Twinings Jasmine Green Tea at the grocery store and was really surprised to find that it has a LOT of flavor -- the jasmine flavor is not strong, I can't really smell or taste jasmine, but the tea is smooth and delicious -- it tastes more like black tea, the water tints a dark brown like regular tea. I'm going back to the store this morning just to pick up a few more boxes! Now I can have my green tea and enjoy it, too!"
2,needs more jasmine,"There is a teeny tiny hint of jasmine flavor in this tea, but for the most part it tastes like normal green tea. I'm not a fan of pure green tea flavor, so I did not enjoy this tea at all. Of all the jasmine green teas I've tried, this is the weakest and worst. I would recommend Stash Jasmine Blossom (my favorite), or Bigelow Green Tea with Jasmine."
1,THE VERY WORST EXPERIENCE WITH AMAZON,THIS SELLER STOLE MY MONEY NEVER SEEN THE PRODUCT AND HAS MADE NO EFFORT TO MAKE IT RIGHT. EITHER HAS AMAZON. I'M GREATLY DISAPPOINTED IN BOTH OF YOU!
5,Discovering Chi,This is an excellent exercise video for any age. It slowly and smoothly moves almost every joint in the body and keeps you muscles toned. There is an informative part of the tape that explains the chi concept and what it does for your body.
4,CALMING,I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY DAUGHTER. SHE FOUND IT VERY HELPFUL IN RELEAVING STRESS AND BECOMING MORE RELAXED. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO DEALS WITH STRESS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
2,Why didn't they tell me?,"My DVD arrived promptly and when I placed it in my DVD player the language was chinese!!!!! Not only can I not read how to get to the different sections, once I accidently do get to a section, I can't understand what is being said. Somewhere it should say in the product information that this is not in English. I can follow the actions on the video but knowing the language would be helpful."
4,SCREAM for Part 4 ...,Well over due squeal to the trilogy series.Will there be a part 5 ... but have Sydney make a cameo at the end of films to help catch the killer or killers.
1,Wow,It's not often that I can't sit through an entire movie. They really should have stopped after the first one. The movies that followed turned the original into a bad joke.
3,Different Vibe from the other 3 movies,"i am a huge fan of the scream movies..i finally watched Scream 4 and well, 1 to 10 . 10 being great and 1 being not great. i give this movie a 6.Scream 4 added to many scenes that didnt make sense..like the begining of the movie. they focused to much on stupid irrelevant The main stars sidney, gale and dewey really didnt have parts in this movie. they were just there.. they didnt have the vibe anymore like the other 3 movies. and scream 4 seemed too short and not really exciting until the ending when the real killer reveals himself/herself. I liked the twist on who the killer was. it was not expected. so kudos. lol but other than that i wish neve, courtney and david had bigger parts. and dewey wasnt the same the others he seemed to boring. gale was to depressed and neve seemed like a snob.well hope you like this review and i hope this helps."
2,Scream 4,"Scream 4, directed by Wes Craven, stars the original cast mates Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette is a horror movie, or shall I say a ""good"" horror movie. Surprisingly, ""king of scary"" director Wes Craven, does a mediocre job revamping the final sequel. It plays on the original Scream, and pretty has the same story line, just a tad bit more gruesome. The movie starts of with a series of movies with a movie. Scream 4, plays on the whole android/ iPhone bit, using an ""app"" to prank call people using the scream voice. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returns back to Woodsbro to finish promoting her book. Coincidently it's the 10th anniversary of Woodsbro slaughter. The killer is threatening to kill everyone close to her, especially her cousin Jill (Emma Roberts). I wonder who the killer is now....?"
4,THIS GO!!!,"I REALLY LIKE THIS FILM, ALTHOUGH AT FIRST I WAS KIND IN THE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE LAST ONE WAS IFFY THAT'S JUST MY VIEW FROM IT. NOW AS I BEGAN TO WATCH THE FIRST FEW MINUTES I'M LIKE OKAY THEY WENT GOOFY WITH THIS HA ONLY TO BE TAKEN FOR A RIDE OF YES THIS IS BACK TO THE ORIGINAL NOT SAYING IT IS CAUSE SCREAM IS A CLASSIC. I LIKED WHERE THE ACTION AND PLOTS COME IN THEN YOUR LIKE IT MUST BE ONE OF THE MAIN PROTAGONIST HMM OR SOME OTHER PLAN THAT THE WRITERS DECIDED TO CONCOCT OVERALL I TRULY LIKED THIS FILM NOT TO OVER THE TOP NOR SILLY I RECOMMEND THIS ESPECIALLY IF YOUR A FAN OF THE SERIES."
3,It was good and watchable,"I liked it but I'm easy to please. Aside from the pointless cameos which I still love Kristen Bell, they didn't need to be in the movie at all. I'll admit to spending most of the movie hoping someone else was guilty but I suppose if the red herring was on purpose it was good writing on their part."
3,Just when you think the original can't be topped??!!...,"First half, watch for laughs...second half, more of K Williamson's genius from the first...you'll appreciate this sequel for making fun of itself, casting hot young stars (pay close attention to Emma Roberts, 'Sydney's cousin'), and delivering a NEVER-COULD-HAVE-GUESSED finale...FOR REAL!! Completely shell-shocking!! A few of the death scenes were annoying because they spout out humor before they die BUT what follows will quickly make you forget!!"
1,"Dumb, Dumber, and the Dumbest","This was a rip off and Im GLAD I waited until it got to dvd to rent it. Not once did I jump. It was a rip off updated version of all 3 screams. The only difference was they use Facebook, texting and webcam ect to make it look like it was happening in our time. The beggining was just like the first scream lol they didnt even attempt to make the stabbing look real. They used the same lines as in the first movie. The rest of the movie you could easily guess what was going to happen next. Boring and big yawn. Sorry Wes Craven but your movies just arent scary anymore. Nice try."
5,The Best SCREAM MOVIE EVER!!!,"I'm a huge fan of slasher films. The scream movies weren't always my favorite ones but, SCREAM 4 i would have to say is the best one yet that they made since the first one. It's def. worth buying if you like the movies."
1,Scream 4,"This movie didn't even make me scream or jump just like the first, second or third one. Scream 4 was boring and it dragged in certain parts. I almost fell asleep. It was just plain disappointing and predictable. The franchise should of stopped at number three. What was Wes Craven thinking of? ""Show Me The Money!"" The movie brings back three of the original cast members from the trilogy . Neve Campbell(Sydney Prescott),Courtney Cox(Gale Weathers), and David Arquette(Officer Dewey Riley). Sydney is back in her home town of Westboro promoting her self help book. She is being stalked once again by Ghost face Killer. Wherever Sydney goes death happens. I'm so happy I just rented it."
3,One too many plotholes.,"I'm one of the biggest Scream fans out there, but I couldn't help being disappointed by this film. I still can't get past the silliness of Sidney going to save Jill at Kirby's house without calling the police first. I mean, what could Sidney do that the cops couldn't? And how did Sidney even know where Kirby lived? The characters in the film get more unrealistic as the film progresses, and that just bugged me. The movie is fun enough, but could've been much better."
4,EAT MY LEMON CAKES,"The movie starts out cleverly as a movie within a movie, one that pokes fun at slasher movies. They ask, ""What is your favorite Scary Movie?"" I couldn't help but think about ""Scary Movie"" which admittedly I enjoy more than these Scream movies. After a decade has gone by we are reunited with the surviving cast to give us another slasher film, one where Courtney Cox is the only woman alive who can fight off a man in a mask with a knife. The whodunit element appears weak as the film only gives us two real suspects. But as it turns out, it is not the obvious. Instead we get an ending with a somewhat unexpected twist. Bravo on the script and to the actors. Solid 4 stars.No sex. No nudity."
5,scream 4,Great Fun.The Ending is a bit weak (for a Wes Craven Film)Ive watched this a bunch of times already.
5,"""dont f*** with the original"" -sidney prescott",LOVE IT BEST SCARY MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN ITS JUST .................... AWESOME!!!!!! THE FUN NEVER ENDS! being a fan of the scream movies i watch them alot and i always know who the killer is. and now i got to be shocked all over again with something i love! FINALLY they didnt screw a new horror movie up!!!!! defenetly a pre- order buy!!!!! : )
5,BEST IN THE SERIES!!!!!!!!!,"I ABSOLUTLEY LOVED THIS MOVIE. IT WAS BY FAR THE BEST IN THE SERIES. EVERY SECOND BROUGHT NEW ACTION TO THE SCREEN, AND, NOT TO MENTION, KEPT YOU GUESSING. I KNOW THE FILM SERIES TENDS TO GET A LITTLE REPETATIVE, BUT THIS ONE SEEMS TO CHANGE IT UP A LITTLE, AND IN A GOOD WAY. I LOVED THEM ALL, BUT THIS ONE IS BY FAR THE BEST. GOOD ACTING, GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS, AND YES, THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF GORE. FUNNY, SCARY, SUSPENSEFUL, AND POP-OUT ARE ONLY A FEW WORDS TO DESCRIBE SCRE4M. AND NO, YOU WONT GUESSE WHO THE KILLER IS."
2,"Been there, seen that...nothing new here","Based on the overall 4-star rating here, I expected something that would not put me to sleep but that's exactly what happened with this film - I thought it would never end. I don't quite get why people seem to like this so much as it seems to me to just be a rehash of the first one."
3,"Mediocre film, but good ending","After seeing the movie, and read some coments, i decided to give 3 stars to this movie, i was thinking of givin 2 (at the most)... but i have to agree with some reviewers that noticed me that the silly parts of the movie was intented to be. In the other part, almost the entire movie was so predictable, some parts it didnt make sense at all... but when i was almost in the point of turning off the movie, the ending save it for me."
3,YOU HAVE TO BE A FAN,"Okay, this film doesn't stand very well on it's own merits. Lacks a lot but i believe that's due to expectations. Therefore, you have to be a fan of the ""Scream empire"" to really appreciate this installment. I've read that in spite of the lackluster showing and earnings, Scream 5 & 6 are in the works. Let's hope some lessons have been learned through this experience. Don't get me wrong, this is a fine horror flick and view worthy. I guess in this day and age, we expect fireworks with everything. But if 5 & 6 are to be the last, let's pull out all the stops."
4,Another Gruesome Murder Thanks to Someone Unexpected,This movie was interesting. It included and probably was made for the next generation of young teens and adults. I was glad to see sexy Hayden Panettiere and Julia Roberts's niece Emma who turned out to be the main suspect for the entire killings. I would probably say this movie was the second best after Scream 2.
3,Scream 4,The movie arrived just fine. I don't regret buying it. Thanks Amazon for having movies at affordable prices. No taxes is nice too thats the reason I order from y'all :)
4,"I love this movie BUT ""don't **** with the original"" lol","I ""grew up"" with the Scream movies and love them, especially the original. The first one came out when I was in high school and I own them all on dvd. (I actually had them on vhs first lol.) If you grew up with them like I did you have to see this one. If not just for the one line."
5,Great comeback.,"The 3rd film was very average, the first 2 are still better but I also really enjoyed Scream 4. The plot involves Sidney Prescott returning to Woodsboro after ten years as part of her book tour. As soon as she arrives, Ghostface once again begins killing students from Woodsboro High, including her younger cousin's friends. Prescott, Gale Weathers-Riley, and Dewey Riley once again team up to stop the murders, but not before having to learn from a new generation the ""new rules"" of surviving horror films. Overall, it's a great horror film and one of the best movies of 2011."
5,THE BEST OF ALL,"LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ONE...IT DONT REMIND YOU OF ANOTHER SEQUEL BUT ITS LIKE THEY ARE STARTING IT ALL OVER AGAIN. THIS ONE IS IN MY ADVICE THE BEST SO FAR AND I LOVED ALL OF THE OTHER ONES, BUT NOTHING TOPS THIS ONE. CANT WAIT TIL IT ACTUALLY COMES OUT ON DVD"
5,GO SEE THIS MOVIE,Just got back from watching scream4. Im a fan of all the other screams but this one is better than 2 and 3. You wont regret checking it out. Go and watch it right now.
2,I fell asleep midway through,"yes. I did fall asleep because i thought it was cheesy, and not scary whatsoever. and by saying I fall asleep I mean literally. I kinda woke up from loud sound effects when Anthony anderson was getting killed, then found myself to fall back to sleep because i didnt really care how many times he got stabbed. the movie just didnt have that scary factor of the first and second. it seemed better than third. but that doesnt say much does it? its also really distracting to stare at courtney cox's Botox ridden face, and Sidney character just cant carry this franchise anymore. I personally didnt feel the groove on this but maybe if I watched it one more time I might change my mind. at this moment i gave it 2 stars. would I recommend this? yeah maybe a 15 year old slasher fan would enjoy it to the end. and nothing's wrong with that. and seeing ghost face again was nostalgic enough. but i hoped a better movie after 10 years of absence."
2,Bloody Awful,"You'd think that after ten years of gestation the writer and director would come up with something better than...this. While horror movies demand a suspension of disbelief, the showdown scene at the movie's end and the revelation of the killer is utterly ridiculous. Truly. (I mean, I know there have been budget cuts in hospital staffing but....) My friends and I sat in the theater staring gap-jawed at how ripped off we all felt. While Scream 3 wasn't on par with 1 or 2, Scream 4 is an insult to the franchise. And can we all admit that although she has Eric for a father and Julia for an aunt, Emma Roberts clearly missed the talented-actor gene and is riding on the coattails--not for very much longer hopefully--of her famous relations."
1,the worst scream ever,me and my friend were wachting it on bootleg. we were not even scard and we were like wtf so we skip the the end to see who the killer was and we were not inpress with the movie at all. do not i reapet do not buy this movie
5,Loved this movie!,"If you liked the first Scream, you'll love this latest edition. I was really impressed on the twists and turns this one makes and it's quite entertaining as well! Much better than Scream 2 and 3."
3,Strictly for nostalgic fans,"If you were a fan of the Scream series, then the characters and the pacing must be familiar with you. Neve Cambell is a self -help author who return home where killers have struck again. She is reunited with her old friends David Arquette and Courtney Cox. Though not as scary as the first film, this is still decent entertainment. Strictly for fans 3 stars. 1/25/2012"
4,My kind of scary movie,"I'm not a huge scary movie fan but there is something about the Scream franchise I really like, maybe it's the cast/characters"
2,This 1 is horrible,I think this is the worst Scream of all in the franchise. Wes could have done a lot better by maybe introducing an actual monster or disfigured slasher as the killer this time. It is just like all the other sequels in the franchise except for worse. It is to easy to figure out. Skip it
3,scre4m,"It's ok, I have the other three screams and I thank that is were they should have stop.It just like seeing the same movie over again with a new cast of people."
5,Termite proof!,"This product is well built from recycled materials. It is termite proof and this was a plus for me here in the South. Hint, don't be lazy, use the provided screws, they really are necessary. Drawback? The cost. I would have liked to buy more but can't afford them."
4,Its okay,"This album is definitely a getter but this guy raps about girls too much (so do sum other guyz but i like them) but he has good beats and a good flow, and he knowz what hez talkin' bout. so if ur a Petey Pablo fan u can get it and enjoy it if not u can make that decision for urself. Some other good rapperz like him are 8 Ball and MJG, or Ying Yang Twins."
1,Pretty but no substance.,"While the wolves are indeed beautiful, they are obviously captive wolves living in an enclosure. The narration is extremely dull and surprisingly uninformed. The video is overpriced and extremely short. If the Porters are knowledgeable about wolves, there appears no evidence of it in this video. For a considerably lower price you can purchase some of the National Geographic films on wolves and observe real professionals at work filming real wild wolves in their natural habitat and actually receive an education at the same time."
3,Very good purchase!,"Indeed I received the product 2 month later because of problems in Argentinian's post services, I am satisfied with the product. The seller answered all my questions and he was really kind. Thank you very much!"
5,Thought provoking.,I really enjoyed reading this. It is very thought provoking. I read it right after my daughter was born. I think this would be a good read again after a few years since you will be at a different place in life and new insights will be revealed.
3,Interesting,"This book was interesting, but not enough for me to finish quickly.However I do recommend it to readers seeking information in the process of body change in women."
4,Suprising quality for the price,"Well-built lens. It provides excellent sharpness (after I sent my 7D in for an autofocus issue) even wide-open and has reasonably fast focusing. The zoom ring is a lot stiffer than my old Maxxum lenses, but is smooth and the barrel doesn't creep when the camera is pointed down. A fair trade. I use it as a people lens at family gatherings and wedding receptions where it's f2.8 constant maximum aperture works well with the camera's stabilization to keep flash usage to a polite minimum. I took a star off only because I wish the wide end was 24 mm instead of 28."
5,A seriously good lens.,This is an awesome lens. It's small and light. The zoom and focus rings have excellent grip and have very smooth operation. The build feels solid. Autofocusing with this lens is extremely fast and accurate. Autofocus operation is also the most silent of all my lenses. This lens is also razor sharp! If you are looking for a constant aperature zoom lens in this range look no further!
2,Not Happy,"I have tried this lense and could not get satisfactory results from it. The zoom barrel is tight and don't give you nice feeling, It seems like you are using a ver cheap lense.The picture quality is not that good."
2,NO,I have tried many diet supplements in my day and I didn't find that this was as effective.You get what you pay for with this product. I am sure with months of use it would have an effect but ifyou want fast results this isn't the product for you.Good Luck!
2,Too large,"They were too large for my work. I called the company and spoke to someone, KC, said she would get back to me but never did. i have to return this product."
2,I'm surprised...,"that everyone here seems to love this album so much. I bought it, in part because of these reviews. I feel gayer after having listened to it, and it's 40 minutes I will never get back. I gave it two stars only because I'm giving it the benefit of sounding better the second time around. It's basically a bad pop album with great guitar playing. Think Mister Mister with some chops. I love great guitar work as much as anybody, but why wrap it up in this sap fest? Blah."
2,Flash over substance,"Eric Johnson can do pretty much anything that you could possibly think of with a guitar. Everything but write an interesting song. There is nothing you can say about the man's technical wizardry that hasn't already been said. The man is an amazing guitar player. But all the flash and polish in the world doesn't cover the fact that these songs are worthless. They're the kind of songs that you used to see on Star Search. You know the ones I'm talking about. Whenever they would have ""rock bands"" on the show. They would come out in their puffy satin shirts and play ""rock music"". Except it didn't sound anything like real rock music. It sounded more like what would happen on Saved by the Bell when Zack and the gang would get together and jam. That's pretty much what you have here from a songwriting perspective. Eric sure has practiced a lot though. Too bad he didn't spend any of that time learning how to write real songs."
2,Souds of an amazing yet lifeless guitarist,"Yes, Eric Johnson plays fast and proficiently but what's lacking here is any degree of emotion or soul. Seemingly his signature tune- ""Cliffs of Dover"", sounds like a run through asweep picking, wide range chord focused guitar lesson with a backbeat stolen from the F-Zero video game. Seriously, everytime that I listen to this guy, Satriani or Vai, I feel like I'm 12 and racing futuristic cars at breakneck speeds while eating Doritos and drinking Mountain Dew. Sorry, but thats just not what I want to come to mind when I listen to music, especially guitar music.Again, I'm not saying that Eric Johnson is by any means a bad guitarist. I respect his ability and technique. But, give me Wes, Burrell, Benson, Green, Hendrix, Muddy Waters, the three Kings, anyone with some palpable SOUL over this dreck anyday."
4,The great stuff is really great--but forget the filler,"This is a guitarist's guitarist. I've been listenting to Cliffs of Dover for years on full blast and it never fails to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. This guy's a genius--I also have his instructional video.But please, program your CD player to skip the songs with vocals."
5,creativity mixed with talent,"This is one the few artists of whose songs I never get tired. I cannot stand repetitive musicians who have identical-sounding songs, e.g. 99% of them today, but Eric is at the opposite end of that spectrum. I have an MP3 system with > 10K songs now, cycling at random my current favorite ~1K, and am uplifted every time one of Eric's songs comes up. His musical genius and creativity continue to astound me even after all these years of listening to this CD's songs!"
4,I've finally figured out why I don't love this album,"I first heard 'Trademark' a few months back on the radio, and decided to buy the album. I like it, but I don't love it. Why?I own 3 electric guitars and try to play rock/blues. I listen to a lot of old stuff like Eric Clapton, Led Zepp, Pink Floyd, Wishbone Ash.This boy can play guitar - there's no argument there. I'd give my eye teeth to be able to play like him. Very articulate with his speed - not just dirty chopping. Cliffs of Dover and Trademark are my favorites, but they're almost the same piece - I have to refer to the album cover to remember which is which.I find myself listening to a couple of tracks and then getting bored - to the point that I have to load another CD. The reason being that it's just him playing the guitar. The rest of the band is just a backing track. No funky bass riffs, no cool drumming, no interesting breaks - it's just Mr Johnson having a good time while the band jams along to him."
2,Nah,"Two stars for Eric's technical skill and because the album is well recorded. I listened to it twice. That's all, baby. It's missing what floats my boat. Don't stop here; too many guitars, so little time."
5,great music,i discovered Eric johnson in the least music conisour way! his song cliffs of dover is featured (and one of my favorites to play) in Guitaur Hearo 3 and i loved playing is so much i thought ok ive got to find out more about this guy so i checked it out here on amazon and i found that right along with eric johnson there are SEVERAL masters of the guitar that i had been missing out on so i highly reccomend Erics music to enrich your collection ;o)
5,The Best,"Easily, far and away, the greatest, most timeless guitar recording ever. You can't go wrong with this CD."
4,great guitar,"i chose this rating because the cd has all the songs that i have heard , i will recommend and bue more"
4,One of the finest,"This album is so good someone stole my original when it first came out. This is the finest mix of electric styles on one album, maybe not ever but darn close. Jonnson has one of the cleanest most pleasing styles for guitar of this speed and precision. Johnson is the perfect example of a musician letting his instrument do the talking and defines the reason guitar players should not sing! PS whoever has my cassette tape would you please return it?"
2,Too basic for graduate school,"In that respect it was not useful. However, it is written in everyday language and for those who seek a foundation of understanding it may be helpful."
3,"Easy to Understand, Financial Analysis in a Nutshell","Give this book five stars. For some reason Amazon inserted only three into my review.I teach graduate level finance for non-financial managers. I have searched many titles in an attempt to find an easy to understand finance book for students. Thank you, Gene!The book translates the language of numbers into easy to understand English. Financial concepts are provided in a step-by-step method so that the reader develops skills that may be used immediately.The book is an easy read with a light touch of humor so that even the non-financial student can grasp and understand difficult topics. Two examples of the way this is approached: ""He bit who?"" translates to EBITDA; and the checklist for managers at the end of each chapter provides valuable tips for the reader."
3,Good overview,"This is a good overview of finance from what I can tell. I have no financial background, and Siciliano makes a good effort to explain things in layman's terms while keeping the meanings clear."
5,Excellent introduction to Finance.,The book does an excellent job explaining accounting/finance terms to the non-financial manager. I am a small business owner and reading this book has provided me with the tools I need to keep my finance clear and also to understand better what kind of information to look for and ask the CPA for a better decision making. Great book.!
1,Waste of Money,"This book was a waste of money. As for the author, Greedy! She did not finish this first book, just so she can charge you to continue the storyline after you purchase another book. What a waste of time reading about all the designer named products. I wondered if she got a kickback for this advertising. She barely introduced some of the characters and then did nothing with them. I will not purchase any more of her books."
2,Disappointed!,"This was a hard book for me to get interested in to begin with. But I kept reading and it really did get better and then I thought I was missing some of the book. I even went back a couple of pages on my Kindle thinking I hit the forward button by mistake. Here in what I would have thought was the middle of the book are all these character discriptions and some of the characters were not even in the book. Any series I have ever read had a beginning, middle and an end. The books could have stood alone, but made me want to continue reading the series to see how the story and the characters evolve. I felt with this book I really was missing part of the book. I doubt I'll finish this series unless the rest of the books are offered for free or the 99 cent special. The only way I'd pay more is if the second one is free and I feel the books are actually going somewhere."
1,Heart knows nothing,"What a disappointment. Even though it was free, I still feel short changed. Chapters about each character until you wondered what you were reading about. Miranda was SUPER, Zelda was a dishonest self-serving witch, Zachary was certainly not as strong as we were lead to believe. I was getting to the point in the book where where I thought the characters would start to humanize, and instead we get a list of all the characters and the part they play in the story (I thought I just read that!).........that's all folks .....buy the nextbook! No thank you."
2,A mid-ninties period piece...,"...I didn't resent the .99 price because the book was fun, in a soap-operific sort of way. The number of ""product placements"" was amazing - do writers still do this? Or was that a 90s thing too? The writing and editing really weren't bad - but one ironic typo is revealing: ""intelligencia.""I got 60% through, and might have spent the time to finish it because it was pleasantly soporific (I was having some insomnia issues), but decided to read other reviews. They were very helpful in letting me know that nothing is resolved in this book and you're teased into buying the next installments (in the guise of sequels)- so I decided to invest $9.99 in a really good book instead.PS: I'm an omnivorous reader. I seldom take time to write reviews, but now that I have a Kindle, and have discovered a strange disparity in the reviews (especially the bargains and deals), I feel it's almost a duty to counter the 5-star over-ratings. I do the same for 1-star under-ratings."
5,A real page-turner!!,"What The Heart Knows is a real page-turner - maybe even more compelling than the radio show, because you get so much more of the story in one sitting! Can't wait for Book II!"
2,I Was Left Hanging,"This was an irritating book. There was no resolution to any of the sub-plots. I kept waiting for something to happen, but the ending solved nothing. I felt like I'd been introduced to these various people and their stories, only to have it go nowhere.Entirely too much of the book was taken up with endless descriptions of getting a cup of tea, or glass of champagne, with entirely too little devoted to any kind of outcome.We were obviously supposed to get hooked on the characters, then purchase the upcoming books. I won't be doing that.A good example of various characters and subplots handled in a wonderful way is Robyn Carr's Virgin River Series. Each book (including the first) deals with a major plot, and other smaller ones. It draws the reader in (addictively, I might add) to learn more, to meet more of these people, to anxiously await the next book."
1,Not a novel,"I kept waiting for a story to evolve, and was disappointed. Too many characters, stereotypical repetitiveness, predictable sequences and narrative. This book seemed more like a would-be-author's notes pulling together concepts, characters and information in order to write a story."
3,Glad I tried this as a Kindle Daily Deal instead of full-price,"The book is good, but contains a lot of ""filler."" There are many pages of review excerpts, author's acknowlegements, etc. The notes say it is Bk 1 but that it can stand alone; I don't think so. At the end you are dropped off with no part of the story complete. The story was interesting and, while I would certainly like to know more, I will not be tempted to pay full price for further volumes unless they are also Daily Deals. Had I paid the full Kindle price for this book I would have felt cheated. It starts several different story lines and doesn't finish even one of them. I would consider this a pre-quel rather than a full novel."
3,Meandering but Quaint Intro to Series,"This is an introductory book to the Milford-Haven series & while I found it enjoyable enough, I don't have a burning desire to get right to the next in the series. The murder mystery (which was the draw in reading this for me) was tied up well enough but I mostly felt that this was all just to set the stage for the next in the series. I did enjoy the feel of the setting. I love sleepy seaside hamlets & felt the author did a very good job giving a sense of place. There are quite a few characters to keep up with & it felt like I was being introduced to the whole town in a flurry, whether or not they were really relevant to the mystery. Honestly, I didn't commit all the characters to memory because I was more focused on the dead reporter resolution. Even so, I feel that this wrapped up well enough to be satisfying even as a standalone if you decide not to read the remainder of the series. This is a light enough read for the weekend or while travelling."
1,No ending,"I wish I had read the customer reviews before ordering this book and not only wasting my money but also my time reading it. The description says ""Though the book stands alone, it is also Book 1 in the critically acclaimed, popular series...) Don't know how they can say the book stands alone - it definitely does not! The book ends with nothing resolved. I know I will not be buying any other books in this series. I hated to even give it one star. The one good thing that came from this book was that it has alerted me to the need to read not only the book description but also the customer reviews when considering a book."
1,What the Heart Knows,"Very disappointed in this book, in a series a book usually stands alone with a beginning and an end, this book has no end!! I thought that everything would come together and it never did, you have to buy the next book to find out what happens, and who knows maybe a third..."
1,Mystery Disappoints,"Thoroughly disappointing. No part of the story is resolved in the book. You have to buy another installment to move forward and since I found both the writing and the story unappealing and trite, there was no incentive to continue."
2,Like a Soap Opera,"This book reminded me of the soaps I used to watch, not an unpleasant way to waste time if you don't mind a predictable plot, somewhat shallow characters, and an unfinished storyline. I chose not to continue with the series. I just wasn't interested enough in the outcome."
1,Read only if you like soap opera,"The 5-star reviews of this book swayed me into buying the book. Now I wonder how anyone could give it five stars. Toward the end of my reading, I thought the book was like a soap opera then read that the author was a soap opera actor. Okay, so that explains things. What a bunch of misfit characters. Do people really act like this? I don't think so. The characters were all caricatures -- either good or bad with no in between. There was no ending to the book. Does the author really think readers with a brain will come back for seconds? Spare me the recipes and write a decent book -- not a made for TV movie."
1,HUH?,"I GOT A THIRD OF THE WAY THROUGH THIS BOOK AND GAVE UP. POORLY WRITTEN AND JUST AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL. HOW DO PEOPLE GET THIS CRAP PUBLISHED?"
5,Perfect scent for the non-floral woman...,"I'm allergic to most floral perfumes and colognes. Rose...almost anything cheap...either breaks me out in hives...or smells like Deep Woods Off on me after a 1/2 hour.This stuff is MAGIC. Sure...at first it smells refreshingly like a freshly opened can of Coke...but after you give it some time to mellow on your skin...the scent becomes really complex. Spice. Sweet. Slightly berry...slightly woodsy. I'll let people give it a whiff without telling them what it is...and all I'll get is...""That smells fabulous...and familiar...""When I tell them it's cola...they freak!If they ever stop importing this...I'll cry. Lucky for me I live in Chicago...and can shop at Smallflower directly. (Mertz Apothecary) But do yourself a favor and order TWO BOTTLES right off. You'll want an extra for your purse. Trust me."
2,Just weird,"I am usually open to all things sweet & cola-ish,but this was just a weird, alcohol like scent. Maybe good for layering & a decent price, so all was not lost."
1,not worth your time find it else where,very unsatisfied when i got it i was really excited that hey ill have a new radiator for my suzuki samurai. i opened it up and the reservoir is plastic. so i went to auto zone and bought one and it was the same damn thing. it just looks cheap! cheap crap. the guys at auto zone even said that it was metal. wrong! a better image for this one what looks exactly like the spectrum cu170 is the Proliance 431206 Radiator
2,Should have stopped at Part 2!,"The Godfather I and the Godfather II are wonderful, almost brilliant. Al Pacino is one of the most attractive bad guys in the film world. This film, however, doesn't draw on his genius or the genius of the previous two films. The plot is thin and doesn't always make sense. The film's romance borders on immoral. The bloodshed seems overdone. Michael suddenly seeks redemption when his character is so much more effective when he doesn't apologize or explain any of his actions. The only reason this film gets two stars is because of Vincent, who is thoroughly entertaining, even if his character is entirely inconsistent and poorly developed. The film world would be a better place if this film had never come into existence."
4,Good.,"'The Godfather, Part III' is an excellent finish to the mighty trilogy. Al Pacino shines like he always does playing his most powerful role. It is nowhere near as bad as people say it is. Many people say that just to go along with the crowd. There are many really good films out there that are still not as good as 'Part 3'."
4,The Godfather Part III,"Though I agree that Mary Corelone could have been done a lot better, I think that overall Godfather Part III made the grade with the underlining theme of Michael wanting to be freed of his past and with Vincent's character development. It is a gamble to follow up Godfather Part 2 and I think that Coppola did very well despite that most of the main characters were not in the final film."
3,"Good, but not like the first two","Godfather 3 had its moments and overall was a good film, but it lacked the magic and the power if the first two Godfathers. Sofia Cuppola did a poor job, probably not from lack of talent but lack of experience. This was her first major role(and her last) and she was up there working with some of the best in the buisness, she was out of place."
4,truly another classic,"I realise a lot has been said about the parformance of Sofia Coppolla in this movie but i think she did quite well even if her death was a bit wooden. Al Pacino again gives a beautiful portrayal of the tortured Michael Corleone and the introduction of Vincent, Andy Garcia, reminds us of the original godfather movie in the similarities between himself and his father Santino. True it is not as strong as the first two films but it is still an amazing tale and should be considered as great as the two. My only complaint is that the end was too rushed and there should have been more story between the death of Mary and the death of Michael clearly some years later."
2,boring and trivial,The second and third sequels of the GODFATHER try to milk the brilliant first part for all the money to be had. Don't waste your time.
1,SO BAD !!!!,I can't believe such talented actor's could act so very bad in this movie.Don't waste your time.
2,A huge letdown.,"As a hardcore ""Godfather"" fan,I really wish this was never made.Godfather 1 is legendary,Godfather 2 may well be my all time favorite movie ever,but for goodness sakes,Coppolla,what happened here? Watch for it on T.V.,see it once,maybe,then check out 1 and 2 for film greatness."
2,"Hit men, where are you?","I kept wishing the hit men would show and take out this movie after about an hour and a half. It was just plain bad. Long and boring. Bad sequence after bad sequence, it just kept getting worse. I finally gave up after 2 hours. I like most of the viewers am a Godfather fan and just wanted to complete the trilogy. I'll probably go back and finish the movie in a week or so just to know I did my duty as a fan of the first two great movies. As far as I can tell though this movie should have never been made."
2,Just bad,"I didn't watch Godfather for III for years because I always heard terrible things about it. Well, they were all true. This movie is awful. The only things it has going for it are the cinematography and Pacino's acting. The actress who plays his daughter is beyond awful- that girl couldn't have gotten a role in a high school play. The plot is weak, the characters are not likable or memorable for the most part. I wanted to just turn off the dvd player after the first fifteen minutes, but I wanted to at least know what happened. Well, now I know, and I will never watch this movie again."
1,Sofia Coppolla and Andy Garcia...,"makes this an amazingly painful movie to watch.It might not be nepotism but it does help when you're father is the producer, screenwriter and director.Did she actually audition for the part?Because she certainly can't act.Garcia is almost as bad in his performance.He isn't playing a character he's playing a caricature.But then again what role hasn't he been just a caricature."
2,depressing,"Tbhis movie could have been so much better - there are occasional moments of brilliance but they are overshadowed by all the crap that surrounds them, the most horrific b eing the inclusion of Coppola's nonactor daughter in the pivotal role of Michael's daughter. Heartbreakingly bad - don't watch it if you have seen the first two and wish to have your image of the Gadfather story unsullied.Ivan Rorick"
1,huge dissappointment for fans of the first 2,"This movie shouldn't be called The Godfather part 3 because the main characters are completely unrecognizable from the first 2. The most complelling aspect of the first two movies was how a very intelligent Michael evolved from a bright eyed bushy tailed kid to a suspicious ruthless man capable of murdering his own brother and how the sins of his father doomed him to this fate. In part 3, without explaination Michael is suddenly a redemption seeking softy wanting to make peace with his enemies and Connie of all people becomes the hawk of the family. The movie would have been better if it had been about how they made this evolution so as to connect it to the first two movies. Throw in the Vatican and Coppola's daughter and it's just too much to swallow."
1,A Disappointing End to a Brilliant Saga,"This movie was shockingly bad. Whereas the first two in the series held your interest and involved the viewer thoroughly in the characters, this final (thank God!) installment nearly put me to sleep. Only Andy Garcia brought this film (somewhat) to life. Al Pacino seemed like a zombie. Talia Shire was this everpresent, hand-wringing crone. (Since when did the characters of Connie and Michael suddenly get so close?) Diane Keaton was completely annoying, and Sofia Coppola gave one of the worst performances I've ever seen. The movie almost felt like a parody of the first two, and I actually laughed out loud at some parts which were clearly meant to be ""soul-searching"" and ""great acting."" My ten year old daughter saw the ending scene where Michael screams (somewhat silently) over his daughter's death, and she said: ""Mom, he looks like he's constipated!"" I guess that sums up the movie..."
4,Godfather I and II are the best by far!,"Ok, I've only seen this version maybe twice and that was a long time ago. From what I can remember of the movie, it is likeable but there was one thing about it that bothered me...why did Mary and Vincent develope what seems to me, a sexual relationship? They were cousins right? I found that to be a bit weird and kind of disgusting but other than that, the movie was worth the watch. Sophia Coppola has never been that great of an actress to me (example: her portrayal of Peggy Sue's baby sister, Nancy Kelcher in Peggy Sue Got Married circa 1987)...she does have that sort of ""valley girl"" attitude in every role but she isn't that bad in this movie. It is worth watching at least once. Of course, it doesn't compare to Godfather Part I & II and with that being said, I would recommend renting this first before purchasing. You might be disappointed."
3,What Was Coppola on when he made this film?,"My first question is,why did Francis ford Coppola wait about 20 years to make part III?Michael Corloene and his sister,Connie,are considerably older and Andy Garcia makes hia appearance as vincent,Sonny's son,who takes over as Don when Michael passes away.In this installment,struggling with inner conflict and guilt after killing his brother,Fredo,Michael continues to do buisness as Godfather,but the burdens become heavy as old age advances on him and he suffers a seizure and heart trouble at the same time.Finally,at the very end,Michael passes,leaving us all wondering:What the hell?!I'd stay away from this flick."
5,3rd best movie ever made!,"this movie only ranks 3rd to the Godfather I & II, cause this moive is amazing though not as good as the first and second by very little. still al pacino plays the role of micheal corleon so well and andy garcia is great also. anyone who liked the other two or any movie like these or any that depict italian american times like these movies certainly do will like this."
1,The Pentangeli solution...,"If Francis Coppola had had any guts, he would have behaved as gracefully as Frankie Pentangeli. When this thing was in the can, he would have had a quiet party with family and friends, then gotten into a warm bath and opened his veins."
2,"OK film, hardly stands up to legendary predecessors.","The Godfather is the movie to watch when it comes to originality and sheer brilliance. The Godfather Part II is more than perfect if you wish to see a worthy sequel. However, it is Godfather Part III that made me want to buy the first two seperate and not all three in a box set. Part III is good in some parts, but I really didn't like it much at all. It wasn't as purely emotional, raw, as the others were so fine at, and it just didn't capture my attention very well. I say, if you feel you need to see this movie, rent it, see it once, just to say you've seen it. But I saw it once, I can say I'll not see it again, and thus, won't buy it."
2,A slap in the face to the first two,"If you enjoyed the first two Godfather movies, you're not going to enjoy the third. Compared to the first two and other great Mafia movies, the Godfather 3 pails in comparision. Francis Ford Coppola should have stopped after the second and he shouldn't have casted his daughter to play Mary Corleone. Bottom line.....The movie sucked!!"
2,why why why !,"What was the author thinking while writing the third book in this series? To compare this film alone I might have given it 3 or 4 stars, but after watching the first two movies I can't give it more then 2. Big mistake on the author part to change the scene from real bad mafia guy to a want to be good mafia guy, that ruined the whole movie. Enough said."
3,Not as good as the first two,"It's too bad the studio took most of the control away from Puzo and Coppolla because this could have been a great film. But that is the beauty of hindsight. If you are a fan of the first two you owe it to yourself to watch it but you don't need to. Pacino still puts on a great performance and Andy Garcia does a fine job, but the movie as a whole just feels empty."
2,not that bad,"Godfather III isn't completely horrible, but it certainly doesn't live up to the first two. Out of the three movies, Part III is the only one where I was bored watching. Sofia Coppola as Mary was a terrible decision by Coppola himself; I was actually glad at the end when Mary was gunned down. Part III does have lots of admirable qualities, the vistas of Sicily are wonderful and the plot concerning the Vatican is semi-engaging. However, the bad parts to the film ultimately outweigh the good and I can't say that I would recommend Part III to others for viewing. Yes, the ending of Part III was tragic and powerful. But, the ending to Part II was cinematic masterpiece. I like to think of the Godfather Part III not as a continuation of the series but rather as a footnote that I can easily ignore in light of Part I and Part II's brilliance."
2,Not A 'Godfather' like feel to it,"This movie is much different than the other two GF'S. This one has Michale wanting forgivness for being in the Mafia, while his life deteriorates before his eyes. Not a great movie, but I didn't think that Sofia Coppolo was a bad actress like everyone says. The best thing about the movie is the end. This way, there can be no more Godfather movies!"
1,whats to like?!?!?!?,"horrible story trumped only by even worse acting.the bright star is the demise of sophia.''daddy?!?!?.............''...wtf...i can only assume francis had a ton of crack and wanted to see if he can direct a movie while tweakin.a pure and utter disgracefull way to end what could have been the greatest trilogy ever!!!!!!!WTFG FRANCIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!btw,give this another title and its still a pile of steaming mule droppings."
2,A Sad Disappointment.,"The worst things about this film are the inclusion of Sofia Coppola who seems to think that she is Rita Hayworth but looks and acts about as appropriate in the role as a puppet from Kukra, Fran and Ollie would... and... the exclusion of Robert Duvall whose presence could have saved this depressing mess. I gave it 2 stars for a couple of good action sequences but it does not measure up to the first 2."
4,Coppola does Shakespeare,"What can I say? It's not the first two, but it's all right. It's certainly not as bad as some say, although Sofia Coppola's performance still grates after all these years.Pacino, of course, carries the film, but he could play Michael Corleone in his sleep. This is more of a Learish turn for him. He gets to act as if he is in Shakespeare. And it is that kind of tragic story.All in all, I liked it. A standout is Andy Garcia, whose is the one character that makes a real impression, somehow without going over the top. But Garcia always does good work."
1,Downgraded due to expectations and nepotism,"This probably should be a 3 star in a vacuum, but its a sequel so it is fair to judge it in context. The first two Godfather movies are two of the greatest films ever. Therefore, expectations were this would be a very good movie at a minimum. When I go back to I & II, III pops up in my head from time to time making those less enjoyable. So I downgrade beause I was very disappointed and it impacts I & II it's so bad.Upside: Andy Garcia was very good in this movie."
2,Weak as hell,"I don't know what Bob Evans had to do with the first two Godfathers but his presence is surely missed here. Coppola has always taken credit for the first two Godfathers being masterpieces but part 3 shows that he clearly didn't do it on his own. As a matter of fact, the more I watch part 3 the more I think Bob Evans side of the story is more realistic. Wow, this movie sucks. Its horrible.Two good things about this movie, Pachino's performance and very beautiful cinematography. Everything else is pure garbage. The Godfather had three sons. Sonny, Michael, and Fredo. Part three is Fredo. Part three is dead to me. And I pray to GOD, that the rumors I hear about making Pt.4 are just that...rumors."
5,Very practical.,One thing that I love of this dictionary is that it have caracters that I can read without a magnifying glass! It is very handle and you can take it every were.
5,A very interesting book,Reading this book has enabled me to look to choosing directions within my life that I had not thought of before.
4,Great Book!,Great book! It has stimulating ideas and inspiring suggestions to apply in your life. You may chnage the way you think after t=reading this book.
4,Why Doesn't the Lexus Complete You?,"If you've ever bought something to keep up with the ""Joneses,"" then this book is for you. Schwartz has a unique argument--that having more choice is making us less happy--and provides many examples to prove his points. Overall, it is an entertaining and enlightening read. Unlike authors who write on similar topics, Schwartz provides a clear and detailed set of solutions. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it seemed a little repetitive to me at the beginning. If you read a lot of books on consumerism in America, you might feel the same way, but it is still worth a read all the way through for the unique ideas in the final half of the book."
4,An interesting and thought-provoking book,"This book aims to explain that Americans literally get too many options for their own good and it accomplishes that goal admirably well. The book is at its best, however, when it relates how the human mind operates before, during, and after making a decision.Schwartz spends about half the book laying out the ways in which each of us conciously or subconsciously compare ourselves to others, get accustomed to new levels of fortune or misfortune, and constantly seek to improve our lot even when it no longer behooves us to do so. The ideas he lays out are excellent for improving your own approach to life or to help you understand what drives other people.Highly recommended for people who enjoy social-sciences and the often irrational workings of the human mind."
4,GREAT BOOK!,"I only read 40% of the ""Paradox of choice"" but so far it's A GREAT BOOK. Very usefull for my job and for my life. Ironic and unconventional, well written."
2,"Good thesis/point, poor presentation/evidence","The evidence was as solid as a '1 out of 10 dentists' endorsement on a toothpaste commercial. I understand what he's getting at with his thesis but 56% of this book used 100% of its pages to use 95% out-of-the-air statistics. Not to mention, the opening just pretty much boiled down to a conversational tone akin to Andy Rooney where he was mad because he went to buy jeans and THERE WERE TOO MANY JEANS!!! There are other books by writers touching on this subject that do a better job addressing the topic. C. Ryan's review says it best with regards to the nitty gritty about why this book has issues and I couldn't have phrased it better. Buy this if you CHOOSE to but don't have a cow about having to choose a book."
1,Why did I read to the end?,The true Paradox of Choice is why did I continue to read this book through to the end? This book is tedious and repetitive. The author reiterates the same logic in chapter after chapter using the format of summarizing a study (that's not cited or referenced) and then offering his opinion.Summarizing the book: Choice is good; Too much choice is bad. Hmm... sounds like we could chart that on a bell curve. I'm sorry the author had such a difficult time buying blue jeans - but don't waste your time on this one.
2,Repetitive and pedantic,"The author's point is that having too many choices doesn't improve life; and, in fact, it can even be detrimental. It takes extra energy and thought to choose from among the dizzying array of choices that surround us; but that effort doesn't yield a corresponding increase in satisfaction with our choice and often yields _less_ satisfaction than if we had made a decision faster. That's it. That's the whole book. A person could read the first two chapters, the last two chapters, skip the (largely repetitive and very pedantic) middle of the book and still get the basic take-away message."
3,"Good subject, bad writing",The message of the book was really good but the actually writing was not. I felt like the wording was kind of disorganized and there was some pretty pointless stuff in there.
1,A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.,"Choosing can be hard, psychological transaction costs if you will. But the book concludes that these costs, because they can be high, means that more is less. As is all too common in these big idea books, there are some interesting ideas but the book fails to move satisfyingly beyond the main idea (say, to the unintended consequences of limiting choice). Hopefully all the readers that like the book and take its ideas to heart will focus on improving their own lives and not mine."
2,Another version of blame my flaws on someone else,"Schwartz states that our indecision, regret, and depression is not due to our inability to prioritize, think logically or take responsiblity. It is because we are offered too many choices. The manufacturers and marketers are making us victims and causing our depression. While he does provide a self help list in the last chapter, the suggestions should be obvious to the average reader. Even if the many products and choices are at fault for our declining happiness it may be more because we expect inanimate items to fill our emotional needs which is totally unrelated to the number of choices we have available. In sum, this book stretchs cause and effect in order to sell books to those who want to avoid responsibility for their own decisions."
5,A Must-Read Manual for Those Suffering from Mall Malaise,"The unease that has been plaguing me for years now -- I call it ""Mall Malaise,"" finally has scientific basis! It appears to be true - instead of choice bringing more happiness, it actually can frustrate and depress us when taken to the extreme.Schwartz's easy-to-read analysis of the pluses and minuses of choice, coupled with scientific/psychological studies on why we feel as we do, will help a generation of overachievers and overconsumers find peace in the midst of plenty.My favorite part -- instead of just explaining the phenomenon, Schwartz provides suggestions on how to mitigate the negative effects of too much choice.I feel better already."
1,"Oh, my...","Anyone who's ever purchased a mobile phone plan knows large arrays of choices are aggravating and can create undue & unneccesary stress. It turns out that large arrays of examples supporting your thesis are also aggravating when they're nothing more than the exact same information wearing a different skin. Mr Schwartz had me from Chapter 1 in this (negative) respect.I found Paradox of Choice to be eminently skimmable, and - on the bright side - leaves the reader with little or no guilt (therefore no stress) when setting the book down with no intentions of picking it back up again.To be fair, Mr Schwartz' solutions to a less stressful life are straightforward enough. They basically amount to ""moderation"", which is something common sense tells us (whether we choose to listen is another matter), and does not require this book.That's one less choice you have to make - you're welcome."
3,You can easily get lost,"in average it's a good book, but I found a lack of 'pure' definitions, there are some good examples thought."
1,LESS IS LESS,I bought this a gift for a socialist I know. I'm sure it will make him feel freer as he gives up his freedoms. Semantics is the playground of people unwilling to face reality or wanting to fool others and this book delivers. I will contue to bellive my lying eyes.
1,Worthless,"Don't bother reading these praising reviewers; they're being paid by advertisers. This book is nonsense. I would recommend it to grade school pupils writing their first social studies paper. It consists of 90% common sense knowledge that every American consumer already knows, which he redundantly spews out with tedious examples chapter after chapter, and the rest is elementary social and economic vocabulary juxtaposed with a few statistics which are openly available to the public. Just another personal journal from a charlatan who landed a publishing deal. I can't believe this guy calls himself a professor."
1,paradox of surprise,"I was actually surprised at how boring this book was. No solid examples of what I thought was boring, but it was, as another reviewer wrote, pedantic."
2,"Too many words, too little detail","Unfortunately, Barry Schwarz is a very smart man that isn't good with stating and backing up his ideas. There is some interesting stuff in here but could be a lot more interesting if it was backed up with more studies and research and even surveys or things like that. Most of the book is just the author talking about the subject and what he thinks about it and going on about it. It makes for easy reading, but it lacks in depth. The book could just as easily be 1/2 it's length and make itself just as useful but twice as efficient. There are better choices out there (pardon the irony), though this book isn't a complete waste of time and as I said, at least it's easy to read."
3,Eye opening book on choice.,"On the advice of a friend, I picked this up, and am glad I did. The author does an excellent job of supporting his hypothesis that ""less is more"" and that an abundance of choice has made our lives harder instead of easier.I learned a lot from the book. I learned about maximizers versus satisficers, what drives us to make decisions, and tools for simplifying dealing with the abundance of choices we face.The writing style can be a bit wordy, and at times I found myself reading and re-reading sentences and paragraphs in order to fully understand the meaning. It's not overly complex, but some sections can be a reading workout. However, the author does support all his arguments in a logical style, and the extra effort required for me to understand some of the more involved points was worth the effort.Worth the read, and hard not to learn something from this."
3,Good premise,"I was excited to read this book. It proffered a view that I had never even before considered, and the author's arguments make sense. However, the author's writing was considerably less exciting than it should have been considering how good the topic was. It was a little on the dry side, and sometimes repetitive. I would still recommend it, however, because it is thought provoking."
4,I loved this book,"Schwartz approaches a complex theme in an easy to read way. Thought-provoking, I highly recommend it"
5,"Not a paradox anymore, now things are clear!",Very good book. Highly recommended. Especially for those out there who have a tough time making decisions.
4,Less is not always more,"Schwartz has interesting insight and the book is easy to read. Though some readers may find that Schwartz's ideas are somewhat old fashioned, this is coming from a reader that appreciates the choices available to him. But still I must urge people to read this book because you will begin to look at the choices you make more criticaly than prior to reading The Paradox of Choice. I will admit even though I do not agree with all of Schwartz's theories his knowledge on the psychological point of view of choices are invaluable."
4,"Be Happy. Just Enough Is Good Enough. More is Less, Less is More.","I liked the parts on ""Measuring Happiness"" (page 105-116) and ""Social Comparison"" (page 187-200).Money matters - but money doesn't matter as much as we think it does. Yes, people in rich countries are happier than people in poor countries. But once society's level of per capita wealth crosses the threshold of poverty and into adequate subsistence, further wealth have negligible effect on happiness.""How I am doing?"" often almost always carries ""compared to others"" in parentheses. The more social comparison one does, the more likely one will be affected by it - and the result is often negative. The world of adundant options encourages a process that will leave us feeling worse about our decisions than we would if we hadn't engaged in it in the first place.Be Happy. Just Enough Is Good Enough. More is Less, Less is More."
4,Choosing to read the Paradox of Choice,"This book is a worthwhile read. It defines the problem of too much choice and offers some ways to deal with it. Delineating the difference between ""maximizers"" and ""satisficers"" gave me a new frame of reference for determining decision making processes. Although this book is geared toward the life of the individual I think the principals in the book can be applied to many business situations. I have to admit I was waiting for him to make the point that the government needs to regulate the number of choices we have - he never does (thankfully)."
4,important,"A glance at the compelling thesis presented on the back of this book made me wonder why I'd never heard of it before. Now I know why: Mr. Shwartz questions a prevailing cultural paradigm in a way that just makes you feel very uncomfortable! Ultimately though, if you're willing to take the plunge, you'll gain a greater understanding of how derive more satisfaction and less anxiety from life. However, the approach of simply limiting choice may be a little materialistic. From a Christian perspective, it seems that the outlined negative consequences of abundant choice can be diffused by spending time in prayer. Also, this book gets redundant about halfway through. Overall an awesome investment of time and money given the great importance of the subject matter."
4,Saved me money,"I wanted to buy this,and then looked to see that there were 20 other books on the same subject. Couldn't make up my mind, so I didn't buy any of them.Great book."
2,"Are you a satisficer, maximizer or a perfectionist?","Are you a satisficer, maximizer or a perfectionist? I would have preferred that Schwartz not use the same examples thruoughout. I feel sorry for those who are paralyzed by too many choices. Schwartz states that he is the type that when he is ""two hundred pages into reading a book, I force myself to finish it."" Me too and crap, this quote is on page 162 and I have 70 more pages to slog through looking for nuggets."
2,"Ordered new, got used","Ordered new, got used. Book was underlined and hilighted. The book was also sent by another company instead of BestBookDepot."
3,Great for the Robert Wagner or Raquel Welch Fan!,"Moderately amusing comedy about a gang of bumbling would be robbers. A must see if you're a fan of Robert Wagner or Raquel Welch, as they both look gorgeous here and smile dazzlingly. The rest of you might find a better way to occupy 90 minutes."
3,a raquel welch fan,"This may be ""mildly amusing"", but with a refreshing lack of pretense, this heist movie is always a pleasure to watch.The ""gang"" aren't really crooks at all and that makes for some comic moments; they succeed despite their ""unprofessional"" status. The lead character is a somewhat annoying Johnny Cool type that comes off dated...but there are other high points...miss Welch...and it's filmed on location in Italy (presumably)!So it's not academy award stuff, but it, in my opinion is eminently re-watchable. And the presense of Edward G. Robinson lends it some classic hollywood status. Get it...I'm waiting for the DVD."
1,Pathetic example of a name book,"This book is a perfect example of everything wrong with baby names. Poor research leading to inaccurate, fanciful la-la-land meanings, copious misspellings to beef up numbers so he can make another book in a year, and academia-insulting catering to trends by putting boy names on the girl side define this book and all its worth (more like, not worth)."
1,"Not so ""Very Best""!","Bought this book for our 2nd baby. Couldn't pronounce most of the names (yes, I'm educated). I'm looking for a not so popular name, but it seemed like most of the names were made up. I'm now looking for another book. Don't waste your money or your time."
1,Ridiculous names,"Most of the names are made up, those that are common have inaccurate meanings listed, and to get to their 55,000 name count they list girls names under boys, and vice versa. Has anyone ever heard of a boy named Rachel? Please! This was a quick return for me."
3,Not the very best,I really wasn't impressed with this name book. I chose a name without this book. The book needs to be updated. Alot of the popular names now were not in it.
4,Bruce Lansky is a great baby name author,"Lansky has written many baby name books and this one is really interesting. It is not as good as 35,000+ Baby Names or Baby Names Around the World both also by Lansky, but a very interesting book. I am addicted to baby name books and I recommend this one."
3,"Obviously, the title is a mis-print","This book, though large, had very few names which were actually viable options. Of course it had the base of ""generic"" names, you know- the ones you can find on pencils in Wal-Mart, the majority of the names were definite ""No way!""s. Unless you are considering Hildegard as a possibility, I would venture to buy another book. I rated it three stars for entertainment value, however. :)Good luck on your baby or new pet!"
3,Pretty good,"This is a pretty good album. Mr. Rodrigues has an excellant voice, but tends to be a bit histronic at times. Three of the songs on here are also done by Ronan Tynan--and Ronan does them better! However, Ronan is a suberb musician and interpreter of songs, and very very few people can possibly do what he does. So, that Daniel Rodriguez isn't quite up to that standard is nothing against him. To use an Olympics metaphor, if Ronan is a gold medalist, then Daniel has the silver or bronze. Incidentally, I heard Daniel at the opening gala of the Olympics and I felt he did much better with God Bless America there than on this album."
5,The Spirit of America,Very talented tenor...had the pleasure of seeing him in person twice and will buy all his cd's...
5,A wonderful CD!,"This is an incredible CD. Thank you Daniel Rodriguez for sharing your wonderful gift with us. The selection of songs is inspiring and the interpretation of each - touches the soul. After my first hearing, I went out and bought another CD for my parents who are both true lovers of music and they loved this CD too - even my father who is the ultimate ""opera fan"". We all look forward to more from Daniel Rodriguez. Hopefully, soon!"
4,Some definite winners on this album,"My favorites are ""Ave Maria"" and ""The Lord's Prayer"" where Daniel truly shows off his vocal talents. I could have done without the choir backup on ""Ave Maria"" but nonetheless a great rendition.The ending that he has for the ""The Lord's Prayer"" almost brings a tear to my eye each time I hear it. Well done Daniel."
4,The Spirit of America,"This is a great CD...of course, Daniel Rodriquez is the best!!!As much as I enjoyed it, I do think ""In the Presence"", also by the same vocalist, is the ultimate. That could be because ""In the Presence"" was the first CD I had of this tenor vocalist, who is outstanding!"
4,Legalize it,"Not as good as Legalize it or Dread or Alive, but very good nonetheless. A litle too political for my tastes but good beats and some pwerful messages."
5,Tosh Rocks!!!,"This album Kicks You know What. Peter always sends out a strong message with his great reggae music and Equal Rights is no Exception. The title track, ""Jah Guide"" and ""Apartheid"" make this one of his best."
3,great reggae,"Though not as good as Legalize It, Equal Rights still has the good rhythms and lyrics you'd come to expect from ex-Wailer Peter Tosh. With a great version of ""Get up, stand up"" as the opening track, and ""Steppin Razor"" (which Sublime covered on Robbin' the Hood) makes this cd worth getting."
4,Certainly worth buying!,"I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is. I bought it because I'm a fan of ""Queer as Folk,"" and Gale Harold who plays Brian on that show is in this movie. But the star of the movie is Jennifer Elster and she is wonderful to watch. I especially enjoyed the commentary by Elster and Harold. Interesting to hear how a film can get made on a small indie budget.Quite a gritty take on beginning love, but I liked it."
5,More than expected,"Truthfully, I bought the movie because I am a fan of Gale Harold and I wanted to see his portrayal of the character. Not only was I pleased by his interpretation of Morrison, but in the end I was won over by the other characters as well. At some point in our lives, we allhave some of the same insecurities Lilli, Morrison, Flora and the others have, maybe not as pronounced, but they are there, and Jennifer's story lets us know it's OK. We are human, and we are all worthy."
4,Hmmmmm . . . interesting.,"The most intriguing thing about this movie is Gale Harold.If you prefer mainstream movies then this is not the movie for you, if you are an indie connoisseur then you will want to see this film."
3,a day of life,A chronicle of not-the-best day in life of the New-Yorkers bounded with family ties and affairs condenses personal and professional problems people should come through to survive.Iconic Gale Harold adds much to this otherwise utterly grey work.
4,Gale Harold is a great actor!,"I became a fan of Gale Harold because of his role as Brian Kinney in the Showtime series ""Queer as Folk."" In ""Particles of Truth"", he gives a pretty good performance. The movie is good, though the pace feels a bit slow at times. If you are a fan of Gale and want to see him in something totally different, then check out Particles of Truth."
4,Gale Harold Portraying a Human Side to His Actor vs. Queer as Folk,"We get to see Gale Harold shining bright! Angst is the ticket, and I believe this misguided, fearful ""germophobe"" is where Gale should continue to build his acting chops, when it comes to engaging characterizations. Jennifer Elster director's debut hits the spot. I love painful dramas showing how truly life can be in all its unique facets and misdirection's; drama, felt with pain and fear? ""Particles of Truth"" is a good bet in anyone's collection. queerplanet.us"
5,A beautifully written book.,"The Limits of Software is eccentric and eloquent. I've never read anything quite like it. Somehow the author has mixed amusing stories, characters and dialogue, and technical material in the right proportion: the book is not just informative, at times it is moving. The book, at 200 pages, reads like a 20-page article; but it lingers like a fine novel."
5,It's like sharing lunchtime with the staff elder.,"The insights and recollections in these essays at first discouraged me - as my naive hopes (that software and standards could tame any problem) were dashed.That discouragement (mostly) disappeared when I realized the author was using ""worst cases"" to make his points clear.I was left with the realization that reasonable people, working on reasonable projects using reasonable rules can accomplish much."
1,Wrong category.,"I worked on the FAA's Advanced Automation System with the author since 1984. (So did several thousand other very bright people.) The author has a few valid points about the difficulties of managing a large hardware, software, and human, integration project. However, if the book had been presented as a fictionalized account or as his personal memoir I would have less difficulty with it. I think that it is misleading to present it as a book with technical merit or validity. It's just one person's view of what happened."
1,pompous joke,"This book is like the emperor's new clothes -- if you aren't carried away by the brilliantly obscure allusions, you must be poorly educated. Ok. I'll be the one stupid enough to say ""uh, excuse me, but..."". I bought this book believing the title was serious, and that the blurb (and forward) by Robert Glass had some meaning. I'm actually embarrassed by how far into the book I got before I finally realized I'd been totally ""had"". I thought the obscure references must have more meaning than I was literate enough to get. In fact, there is no real content to this book. There's nothing but tease. It flits around, goes off on silly tangents, but never actually gets to any meat about ""the limits of software"". I've bought a lot of computer science-related books from Addison Wesley over the last 30 years, and I'm very surprised, and disappointed, that they published this tripe."
1,Glad I bought this used!,"Glad I bought this used. The 3 disc set sounds nice but not really necessary. Disc 1 is music only. Disc 2 requires a second CD player and speaker, like a boom box. I don't know about other people, but I'm not inclined to go to the trouble to even listen to the second disc. Disc 3 is a DVD with nothing really genuinely worth watching.The music has a few Arkenstone moments but nothing that we've not heard before; and, frankly I'm getting tired of the Celtic pieces - Arkenstone is much more creative than that."
1,Not a Fan,"This may be the second book in thirty years that hit my garbage can rather than book exchange or my library. Despite good plot, plenty of action, intriguing characters, and likable protagonists, I felt dirty when I finished. The good plotwork kept me going, but the explicit brutal sexual treatment (raping of mind-damaged teenagers as a cultural element) left me ashamed that I didn't throw away the book mid-read. Harlequin at its worst made me feel almost this disgusted."
4,The whole book is magic!,"Contemporary magic meets ancient mystery as two lovers struggle to put to rights the world that keeps them apart. Although the characters are both sorcerors, the true magic is that of the love that develops between them. It would be wonderful if Ms. Hooper wrote more books in this world."
4,Wizards and Love - What a great combination!,"This is the first book I have read by Kay Hooper, although I love fantasy and romance - together and separate. I really enjoyed this book. Very unique and thought-provoking. I couldn't stop thinking about it even after I finished it. The plot was fairly complex and I really liked the hero and heroine. Mostly what got me was that the conflict between male and female wizards was very unique and yet still very believeable. I have not read any other books that approached magic and power in this way. Definitely recommended reading!Now I've got to find more of Kay Hooper's books!!!!"
5,Great read!,This is the first book I've read by Ms. Hooper but it will not be my last. I loved it. Entertaining and fast-paced. I highly recommend it.
4,The Wizard of Seattle by Kay Hooper,For a short story fiction book I thought it quite fun and a great little read. This book would be great for a cold rainey day to curl up with. I really enjoyed it!
4,Student recommendation,"Being a student myself, i find this book very useful to navigate my way around the desktop browser. This book is easy to use & is explained in plain english. When working with several different packages, you need a reference like this to help with those commands you may have forgotten. Well worth buying!"
2,Not the greatest,Glad I ordered two (I think). When I cleaned one for the first time the webbing came loose (using cold water). It will do as a backup. The verdict is out as to whether I will ever reorder these - depends upon how long the vacuum cleaner lasts.
1,Not a dyson filter,"The seller states that this is a Dyson filter and even shows a picture of a Dyson filter. However, they send me a cheap generic imitation wrapped in a package that says it's a dyson filter. How illegal is that? Absolutely shameful. I'll never do business with them again. Look at the filter itself to verify what you get. Don't put anything that is off brand in your Dyson vacuum. It could ruin it."
4,Nice to have a spare,"This is exactly what it says it is. It fits, and it's nice to have a spare so that I don't have to wait to vacuum while the other one is drying after I've washed it.Make sure you buy the right one. This fits the DC 07."
5,had to find in stores now,"Always pays to have a back up of these, good price and great delivery time. And works like supposed to."
2,Not a real Dyson filter,"Given the name of the product, you'd think you were getting a real Dyson filter. This is not the same as what Dyson sells. It actually seems a bit wider and makes getting the filter into the vacuum cleaner a bit difficult.I just got it so we'll see how well it ends up working."
1,Not as advertised,"I also chose this item because it stated that it was made by Dyson. However, the one I received clearly is not. It merely states ""Designed to fit Dyson."" I am disappointed and hope Amazon corrects this, so others don't keep having the same issue. I wish I would have read the reviews before I ordered!"
1,don't buy a fake filter!!!!,What's the point of buying a 400 dollar vacuum and then putting a cheap piece of crap filter in it?
2,"Sorry, but does not play all my cd's","I bought 2 of this Boss DVD players and it's a fake, it doesn't play most of my cd's, the font display is poor, you can not see anything during the day, the other one I haven't even opened yet, I'm going to sell it cheaper than I bought it, so I can get some of my money back, I had Pioneer before the Boss, I had to buy another of the same. you can imagine how I have spent because of these pice of junk"
2,Not goog...,"After I tested it for 1 week it just was really hard to make it read DVDs or CDs, whatsoever... The sound quality is not good... Its being 10 months since I bought this one and it went just back to the original box and replaced it with a JVC MP3/WMA receiver... Way better choice!"
5,Just Like New (The day I bought the truck),The mirror looks like when the truck was new at the dealer. It looks to be OEM. I know where to buy any mirrors in the future.
1,The caricature of Pancho Villa,"This book is full of speculation and rhetoric. No historical value, very questionable and full of imagination. Waste your money on candy, not this book. Poor scholarship."
1,"""Legend"" is the Operative Word","A collection of yarns, fairy tales, and ghost stories that should not be listed as an Historical work. I found this book boring and nonsensical. Maybe I was just having a bad day, but it added nothing to my knowledge or appreciation of Francisco Villa."
5,"Super fun for adults, too!","I bought this for a friend's 50th birthday. It was a huge hit, and it's lots of fun to play with kids or with grow ups!"
4,Lots of Little Girl Play,"What a great game my daughter received this for her birthday and just loves it, everytiume someone comes over she has to play it with them. Her and Grandma play it every Tuesday evening it is there special girl time. Would recommend it to anyone."
4,Great Beginner Game,"I have 2 daughters, ages 4 and 5. This is the perfect game for them to play together. It is so simple, without any complicated rules. Both of my daughters love it and my youngest can play it without frustration. I bought this for a few friends childrens as well. A great buy"
4,This game is really cute - but the board needs HELP!,"The game is adorable, as others have said. My daughter loves it. I don't know if anyone mentioned this, but your daughter will get to decorate the crown and jewelry box with little gems that come in the game box - she'll loves that! You only do it once, but it is fun for kids.The game board is disappointing. It's actually 4 pieces that you fit together sort of like a puzzle. They don't always go together very well. I'm not sure why the board wasn't produced in one piece as that would make this game much better. It's not anything that prevents you from playing, it's just annoying.There is a version of this game that features Disney princesses. It's not easy to find. I've seen that version on Ebay and also at the toy store at Walt Disney World. I had really wanted that version for my daughter, but we got the original version as a gift. I wonder now if the game board is sturdier on the Disney version?"
5,LOVE PPP,"LOVE Pretty Pretty Princess! It is fun for all ages, I bought this to play with my college friends and we had a great time!"
4,How I rate Pretty Pretty Princess,"I think that Pretty Pretty Princess is not only a game, But I also think it is a fun game where their is lots of laughs and lots and lots of... BEAUTY!!! I just love travling to Oregon and California and seeing Pretty Pretty princess! I like just everything about this fun childrens game! Thanks Milton Bradly!"
3,Great game should be more durable,"My daughters (ages 4 and 5) did love this game, as it was one of the first games they could understand and play without an adult if need be(besides to break up the fights when one didnt win!) However, the board does not stay together very well and almost all of the earrings have broke. I guess you get what you pay for. Provided much entertainment and overall would recommend."
5,An all time favorite,"When I was 7 my best friend invited us over for her birthday.She brought out pretty pretty princesses and i loved it. but then i couldn't find it anywhere.So when i saw it on my recomended list,it really made my day!If you have a young child i really recommend this."
3,disappointed,I chose to purchase this product because I was looking for the edition of the game that was pictured on the website. I did not received the version of the game that was pictured and was very disappointed.
4,This price is insane !!,This game is really cute and my girls love it. I just bought this game at another store onsale for $5. Normally $8. How on earth can this place charge $52 dollars for this game?? That is completely insane and just wrong!! That is horrible. What is wrong with this world??
3,Poor Quality,The product was not the quality it was advertised and so we feel we overpaid for the poor quality game.
4,glad we received it,"We received this game as a gift and I was not very happy about it as we try to limit focus on vanity with our young daughters. Having said that, the game gets a lot of playing time. The box says ages 5 and up, however much younger children can play, bottoming out at 3 because of choking hazared sized pieces. We change the rules so that you can choose which direction to go so that the game is a bit more than a random spinner game. (adds a tiny bit of strategy) The kids off and on refuse to wear the earrings because they are the pinch type (of course) and then just lay them in front of them. We used sharpies to color in the numbers on the spinner because they were hard to see as they are gray on gray."
3,Probably good for right mindset child,"I know - everybody loves this game. What's not to like? Well in my case, it's my 4-1/2 yr-old who played with it once and has shown little or no interest in it since. Granted she likes princesses but she doesn't LOVE them like lots of other girls. But I think the real issue is the relative lack of challenge. We got Monopoly Jr. at the same time (both for Christmas) and we have been playing that almost every night for the past several weeks. So my recommendation is to buy this game if you have a 3 yr old (and older) who loves princesses. Think twice if your child is older and is into more advanced games already because if they are this game has the potential to be a very short-lived thrill."
5,Very Fun,"Okay - i know it seems very ""girly"" and it is - but seriously, if you just go with the game, have ""fun"" with it, and laugh at how silly you look when you start putting on the items... you will have great time - guys, for your sister's sake, or your daughter's sake, just cut loose and have fun with this - you won't be sorry. I'm a dad, and we laugh every time we play at how silly we look."
4,The toy's great for pre-5 girls; arrived with a dented box :(,"Little girls love this board game, and it can be fun for the adults enlisted to participate, especially if they're daddys or grandpas. The gradual transformation of the players into ""princesses"" is awesome to the little ones and hilarious to the adults, whose gradual metamorphosis corresponds with the royal jewels they collect as they journey around the playing board! Take pictures!"
5,I remember this!,"OMG! I remember this! i loved playing this as a kid. It was my favorite game. My parents bought it for me and i still have it 16 years later. I lost intrest in it when i got older, but i remember playing this with my mother and father. It holds some of the best memories. I say give this to your child, it's simple and perfect for little girls who want to play dress up or a game. It's a perfect compromise as well."
4,A Heady Brew,"This probably will not appeal to the mainstream rock/pop fan, but it is a unique mix of electronica and hard psychedelia - if you are into that, I recommend giving this a try. Electronic beats, echoing effects, industrial noises, and cascading, roaring guitars make for a thick, dreamy mix. The record, like a lot of rock music, suffers from talentless, hollering-in-the-void vocals. Apparently this was an English group who were together from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s."
5,Good cd!,"I love Richard Elliott and this cd has some good music/songs on it. If you like Richard Elliott, or just enjoy good low key jazz music, then I would recommend this cd for you. It's great for relaxing."
4,Games Using Compound Words and Phrases,"This game is fun and kids really enjoy it. Visual Eyes can be very good for students learning English and are developing knowledge of compound words, phrases, and idioms. I did find it annoying that the white paint from the game dice flaked off right when we started. I don't think the dice will look good after many times playing."
3,VisualEyes is really clever,"The high school and college-age kids who have played this have enjoyed trying to see phrases more quickly than the other players. Lots of laughter follows less-than legitimate phrases, and the competition is friendly and silly. We like that it is not limited to just a few players -- we have had over a dozen teens hovering over the picture cubes. But although the box says age eight and up, very few elementary students will be familiar with enough phrases to keep up with older participants; they would need to play with others in their age group. We usually only play a few rounds because this game does not hold our attention for long. But the good thing is that each round can be very quick so it never seems tedious."
4,1 Day Wonder,This is a fun puzzle. However I found it very easy because I put it together in one day. It is difficult at times but the result is worth it!
4,A Doors Sampler,"Released in 2002, ""Bright Midnight: Live in America"" offered previously unissued 1969-70 recordings of The Doors in concert. Now that the complete shows are available, this disc serves as a tantalizing sampler of the Hollywood, New York, Boston, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Detroit engagements. Along with the excellent sound quality are memorable versions of ""Break On Through,"" ""Five to One"" and ""Light My Fire."" From an unvarnished standpoint, Jim Morrison's drunken interpretation of ""Roadhouse Blues"" tells you all you need to know about the group's wild and unpredictable Boston gig. Though derived from the same concert tapes, ""Bright Midnight"" remains a more satisfying Doors compilation than ""Absolutely Live."""
4,Bright Midnight: Live in America,Bright Midnight: Live in America is a live album with Doors that was released 2001 and is compilation of performances in many different US cities between 1969 and 1970. The liner notes are written Danny Sugerman. The CD booklet has a cover photo of Morrison. We also get some black and white photos of the other members of the band. 4/5.
5,Solid Sampler,"A great sample of tunes from a variety of Doors shows in 1969 and 1970. Some of these will sound familiar as they are taken from shows that were featured on the 1970 'Absolutely Live' LP and 'Alive She Cried' from 1983. The disc kicks off with a good version of ""Light My Fire"" recorded in Philadelphia. The highlights though are songs that haven't been released live, especially ""Been Down So Long"" from the 'L.A. Woman' album that was released the same week Jim left us. Other highlghts are ""Touch Me"" and ""The Crystal Ship"" which also are not on previous live LP's. The version of ""The End"" is also good though not quite as strong as the one performed at the July 1968 Hollywood Bowl show (which closes out the 2CD 'In Concert' compilation). Future releases are forthcoming and will be available from the Doors' website which can also be accessed through 'rhino.com'."
2,Past Their Prime,"Its too bad because there are great live recordings out there (HELLO, will someone officially release the 1967 Matrix Club appearences) but this ain't it. The reason is not the sound quality (which is excellent) or the song choices (wisely focusing on earlier more solid albums) but the performances. By this time Jim Morrison had turned into a bloated, Charles Bukowski-ish parody of his former self. The songs meander and jam unwisely and Morrison mutters some lyrics here and there. This is not to say that the Doors were not good live (consider the official 1968 Roundhouse performance dvd- a solid concert right there) but that due to personal reasons as well as the band kind of running out of steam the live shows had declined into an impromptu poetry recital with musical back up. There is quality material out there. Wait until they release it."
3,hard-core or moderate fan?,"I'm a hard-core fan so i didn't spent my money on this cd, i bought the two complete concerts and the rehearsal. 3 double cds that contains all that's on this one and much more. Of course, if you're just a moderate fan, this is a great deal but for a hard-core fans who wants everything and more, buy the complete concerts direct from bright midnight records, otherwise, you would be greatly disppointed to find out that there are complete concerts available and that you just buy some excerpts of the concerts. A hard-core fans buys anything, to be one of them, you must have at least 10 bootlegs like i do."
3,Yahtzee Avatar Gam,"While this game is rated ages 5+, it is simplistic in both design and method. The ""advanced"" game is not much different from the basic game. We ended up changing the rules and making our own score sheets modeled after the regular Yahtzee game to make it more challenging. My daughter loves it because it's Avatar, though!"
1,Not worth purchasing,"Not worth buying. I recently purchased this CD. The unfortunate part was I had to wing it because there was no sample available. The rain sounds wonderful but then your good feeling turns to a bad one. The sax just doesn't work in nature. It actually sounds like this individual could be a reject that got booted out of jazz camp. Trust me this isn't music, this is annoying. Don't waste your money.KB, MI"
1,It's Raining Saxophones,"I got this CD with the hope that it would be calming music to create visuals conducive to relaxation for the cool-down segment of my Pilates class. Rather, it made me feel as though I was in a bar drinking while the hole in the roof was rhythmically dripping rain water on my head.And, to boot, that poor blues saxophone that got caught in a noisy torrent of thunderous rain."
3,Background music,"If you like nature sounds and jazz, this is a good CD to have on in the background."
2,Frustrating,"I got this for my 9-year-old to do for a school project. It said it was fine for children over 8. The directions were terrible. Few words and lots of inaccurate photos to aid in the construction. The insturctions do not allow for the thickness of mortar in between the bricks to be able to hold it together. There was quite a bit of dissolving of mortar and redoing in order to build this. I'm a civil engineer so it's not as if I don't know what I'm doing. In the end, I ended up doing 90% of the construction for him. It was for a school project, so because mom had done so much for him, he had to do something else to show the work he did."
5,A classic book on England & children's literature,"I would recommend this book to anyone- as a read-aloud, a travel book, or just something to read to yourself. Mrs. Bodger & her family truly loved English lit., and her love for it shines through. In this book you will discover Narnia, Beatrix Potter's country, Kipling's ""Puck of Pook's Hill"" ( a delightful look at old England) and many other such treasures. Mrs. Bodger's writing style is clear, her family wonderful- and the subject, English children's literature- will always be fantastic."
2,A classic? Ultimately unsatisfying.,"I wanted to like How The Heather Looks, really i did. For all her alleged prowess as a story-teller though, Bodger was unable to fully engage my attention. Her writing style came between us, as did certain aspects of her story. On a trip to discover the landscape behind certain childrens classics, her family was curiously uninformed about where they were and what they were missing. One becomes tired of the phrase, ""Later we found out..."" or ""If only we had known..."". We are treated to a detailed explanation of how much her family knows about Gypsies, but we look in vain for that information when it would be appropriate; instead we are told of another castle passed by. I was sadly disappointed by the lack of information at the bottom of the story."
5,"Carmen Dragon.......""A Genious""!","The first two LP albums that I purchased as a boy were ""Americana"" and ""Bless This House"", by Carmen Dragon and the Capitol Symphony Orchestra. Many of the songs on this album are from those two albums. His arrangements of the songs on this album are more than tremendous, they are a pleasure to listen to. This is music that will live down through the ages. Thanks to Angel Records for the remaster of these albums. I highly recommend this album to anyone with the ear for great music."
2,Scrabble Jr. Review,"This game was disappointing. It needs to be more like the real adult version with double points, etc. It did not come with a holder for the letters, so we had to lay down our letters on the table and others could see them. Letters were made of medium thick cardboard! Overall, the game was just okay."
2,Go for the regular version instead.,"----------------------------------""Scrabble Junior""(Hasbro toys)----------------------------------If you like Scrabble, and come from a Scrabble-playing family, I'd say this kids' version is not worth buying. The graphics are ugly and hard to focus on, and the game itself is less than satisfying, and doesn't inspire much in the way of learning new words (particularly since one version of the game asks the players to spell out predetermined words that are printed on the board itself...) Don't sell your kid short: just get a regular Scrabble board and teach them to use that. Your kids are smart enough to play real Scrabble, not some tacky, dumbed-down kids version. (Axton B., ReadThatAgain kids' media reviews)"
4,Pefect for those non-readers/spellers,When your kids know the alphabet and just starting to form words this is a good investment. They quickly add a few words to their vocabulary and it is a fun way to play scrabble. If your child doesn't like board games ... skip this one. My 11 yr old still perfers the easy of this game over regular scrabble because you don't need to have a great vocabulary to play it. It's sort of luck of the draw with a bit a strategy as to when to play the tiles.
3,The goods and the bads and the solution,"Here's the deal. You can't really go wrong with scrabble because any way you spin it, it is in fact an educational game. The colors are vibrant and the board is a nice size and double sided for age progression. However, the letters are cardboard and side around and if someone walks by to quickly you may have to start all over cause the pieces will fly away. Additionally the board is a tri cut instead of a half fold. I have no idea why they did this but again the pieces slide because the board doesn't lay totally flat. There is a little travel game called Apple Scrabble. It's letter pieces are tile like the real game. My suggestion is buy Scrabble Jr. and Scrabble Apple. Use the tile pieces from Scrabble Apple in the Scrabble JR and you have yourself a fun evening without complications."
2,Not really worth it!,"Buy the real one instead. It's cheaply constructed and really limited on the ""Junior"" side."
2,Not your typical scrabble,My sister had bought this for my daughter and the instructions seemed vague and a little unusual for a spelling game that we are used to.There are two ways you can play this game but now I find that we tend to play neither because we do not understand the instructions.We stick to regular scrabble and just down size it to fit the vocabulary for an eight year old.We have just as much fun as if it was a bunch of adults playing.Albany
4,Depends on age,"I first played Junior Scrabble when I was four years old. I learned to read at a very early age (2 years and nine months), and so I always played the more difficult side. I remember it being challenging enough and entertaining enough to keep me interested, but also easy enough so that I wouldn't give up.I would recommend this toy to 4-6 year olds."
3,Kid at Heart,Ok I bought this game from Amazon the shipping and packaging was great. The product itself was not that impressive. I was told by a first grade teacher this would help my lil one meet the requirments that she was failing to meet so I bought it we have played it one time and half way threw she was very bored with it.. The game has not since been played and thats been going on a month.
3,Scrabble Jr.,If your child doesn't have an exstinsive vocabulary the side t hat mirrors adult Scrabble can be quite frustrating. The side that mirrors a crossword puzzle can be very repetitive for the older child. This game is best for someone just learning to read.
1,Power Adapter,"Amazon gave the impression that the adapter fit the product I was purchasing. It did not. It wasn't worth shipping back. So, was I stuck with it? Not for long. Instead of moving it around for years, or keeping it around for a product it would fit, I threw it away. Problem solved."
5,DITTO WHAT THE OTHER 2 REVIEWERS SAID!!,"Telefuzz's SLEEP is a triphop ambienic downtempo spectacular sound that took me away to another dimension! The weird song titles, notwithstanding, this set was wonderfully produced with just the right vibe to get you going as well as chill you out. I particularly love the way the songs segue and build from slow burn grooves to danceable cuts! A sure late-night pleaser... Highly recommended! A+"
5,Better than buying the whole game,"Got these when it was time to teach the game to my granddaughter. We have plenty of dice but no score cards. My daughter told me I could have just printed them out on Google images, but these are great for me. I'm a bit nostalgic and for $5 would rather have the real thing! The six year old beats me almost every time. What's with that???!!"
3,Sheets good / hard to split pad,Splitting the pad for three players caused single sheets to come unglued. Annoying but ok. Also felt price was a little high for something that can be printed online for free.... Might consider doing the latter and binding on my own in the future....
3,Good but use [...] for free,These score cards are perfect if you want to waste trees. No seriously though... sometimes it's just nice to be able to write your scores on a piece of paper. But if you're just playing a quick game for fun and don't want proof to frame on your wall I found this cool website called [...] that lets you write in your scores for free... it also calculates the totals for you along with a running tally so you always know who is winning. Check it out.
3,Replacement Cards,"Our family has enjoyed Yahtzee for years, and it is nearly impossible to find replacement cards in any local store. We were happy to be able to buy them through Amazon."
2,"Academic, boring and lacks pictures.","I thought this would be pictorial introduction to Briton culture but it is a dry academic work that is dull to read, confusing, and lacks colour and pictures."
4,Smooth Jazz Sounds!!!!!,"I should really be giving this cd four and a half stars. Four is kind of too little, but five is definetely too much. This cd is obviously Spyro Gyra's most smooth jazz influenced album. All their others have a more contemporary feel. This album's got some nice tracks like Jay Beckenstien's groovin' Feelin' Fine Parts One and Two. Lucky Bounce, Groovin For Grover and the opener are great. A rarity is, the last track, written by drummer Joel Rosenblatt. Overall, this was a nice package, but it could be better."
5,Punk o mania,"This is a great cd to listen to while driving, working, partying, whatever. It is a good collection of songs from a bunch of good punk bands. (not blink 182, sum 41 etc.) It is more than likely that after listening to this a few times, you will be singing along and air-guitaring with many of the songs."
3,Gimme a break...,"Come on people.I can't understand you don't get bored with compilations like these. It's fun to discover new bands but you can't base your judgement on one song only so you need to find another source still to find out if you really found a new band.Ok, this is not the worse out there. There are worse compilations, but well. Some are better. Punk-O-Rama 2 and 3 are better than this one, so I'd say buy them IF you want to buy a compilation. I prefer EP's and albums though.Also, why is Tom Waits on this compilation? Yes, I know why; because's he on Epitaph...but isn't this called PUNK o rama?"
2,"Mind as well buy it, its cheap!","this is the worst punk o rama cd. I dont raelly like any of thesse bands either(except bd religion) . But for the cheap price you should buy it, you mithgt find something you like!..."
4,Pretty good...,"I got this cd today thinking , ""how can't it be good? approx. .20 for each song?"". It is quite a deal, only 4.99 for 25 punk songs. As for the songs, they are pretty good, but some just don't belong on this album. They should have put a better H2O song on it than ""Faster than the World"" cause that song is good, but not their best. There is also another song by Straight Faced, being the hardcore band that they are, the vocals grind on your nerves after a few seconds of listening...not to mention all their songs sound almost alike. Overall, this cd is worth it, and i guess it is about as good as Punk O Rama 3. Later."
5,Punk Rocks,This CD along with all the rest of the punk o ramas is a punk compulation collectors dream... I highly recomend this to anyone with a taste for some good Punk Rock.
2,kids playing with synthesizers,"This albumn sounds like it was made by a bunch of kids playing around in a garage with synthesizer equipment. Although it has a reliable steady tempo that you could do aerobics to, the music has no content other than silly voice effects and a run through of available drum patches. If you are looking for something totally mindless to move to, this is your albumn."
1,no.,"To be quite honest, don't buy this.Looking at the back, it leads you to believe that it's don't some fantastic scary story book.. And it's not. So unless you like stories that actually sound completely ridiculous, waste the thirteen dollars and the hour i spent trying to make the book interesting.GOOD LUCK."
3,A fair film that could have been better,"It could have been a good sequel but it suffers from bad writing. There are too many lines to the plot. They had some great villains with the bikers but the story makes little sense and poorly develops. It would have done better if they got rid of some characters like Keough and his confederate who played two corrupt cops at the station or changed Keough to his partner. Brent Jennings would have made a good Iceman and the IA Officer,Kevin Tighe, would have made a much better corrupt cop. They needed a better Icepick. Why couldn't the SF Police and the Iceman simply recognize that Reggie Hammond is a material witness whose testimony will convict the Iceman? Stronger writing was clearly needed for this film. Unlike 48 Hours the plot to this sequel is far too contrived. With 48 Hours they captured lightening in a bottle. Another 48 Hours is a fair film. Acting was never the problem. The cast struggled but couldn't rescue the script."
5,Another 48 hrs of action,Another 48 Hrs the sequel to the Walter Hill classic 48 Hrs is an action packed comedy that i dont understand all the bad reviews for.It is extremely entertaining sequel and i love the first one but this one is a load of fun.Reggie and Jack are back! I love Nolte & Murphy and its sad to see both their careers suffered a bit because theyre both amazing actors.Another 48 Hrs is violent like i wish action movies nowadays and not just a bunch of talk and plot.I for one like action and comedy and violence mixed.I think movies like this defined the times and i wish they were still being made.So once again this one is a whole lot of fun.Check it out if you like Eddie Murphy Or Nick Nolte.Great movie!!!
3,"WELL, WAS IT REALLY WORTH THE WAIT FOR THEIR COMEBACK?","IN THIS ONE, JACK CATES NEEDS REGGIE'S [WHO'S JUST GOTTEN RELEASED FROM JAIL] HELP TO HELP HIM SAVE HIS JOB AND CLEAR HIS NAME OF A WRONGFUL DEATH. THE VILLAINS HERE AREN'T AS HALF AS ENTERTAINING AS THE ORIGINALS WERE. AGAIN, EDDIE MURPHY DOES A MEDIOCRE SEQUEL. THE TWO LEADS ARE STILL FUN TO WATCH, BUT, THE PLOT REALLY BRINGS IT DOWN. IT'S NOWHERE NEAR AS FUNNY AS THE ORIGINAL, BUT, I GUESS IT MAKES AN OK COMEDY/ACTIONER."
2,By The Numbers Sequel,"Another 48 Hrs. isn't as good a film as the oringial but it's still has it's moments. Eddie and Nick still have the chemistry as Reggie and Jack. The action seqeunces are upped a bit and the finale of the film is action pakced, althought this is one of the films that started Eddie down's fall and it shows in his performance. But for me the action sequences and the bar scene earn the film ** 1/2 stars"
2,Another Unnecessary Sequel,"Though it's nice to see Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy back together, the motivation is woefully lacking in director Walter Hill's follow-up to the 1982 action-comedy. Apart from a few engaging setpieces, everyone goes through the motions for a big paycheck. ""Another 48 HRS."" lives up to its title - derivative in the worst sense."
3,STANDARD FOLLOW UP,"ANOTHER 48 HRS is just that--another ""48 Hrs."", but this time, it's not as much fun. The first movie had the freshness of the pairing of Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte, and had lots of action and humor. This time around, the chemistry might still be there but it seems a little shopworn, and it's not as much fun. The plot is a rehash of thousands of crime movies, and Murphy who had now become a box office smash, gets top billing, but doesn't capitalize as much on Reggie's sense of comic timing. Andrew Divoff, who was to go on to make the WISHMASTER films, is a vile and convincing villain, but the rest of the cast seems to phone in their performances. If you really liked the first movie, you'll probably enjoy this but may be disappointed when you're finished viewing."
2,"Bad Sequel! Bad, BAD Sequel!","They get in fistfights again, they still treat eachother like dirt, Eddie does ""Roxanne"" again, Nolte shoots at the guy holding a gun against Eddie's head again, another redneck bar, the same ""sky blue Cadillac"", the list goes on and on. Never have I seen a sequel so desperate to cling to its predecessor as this one. And sequels are NOTORIOUS for clinging to their predecessors (""American Pie 2"" and ""American Wedding"" anyone?). It has its moments, but trouble is you've seen most of them before when they were still fresh and original. Worth renting if you're a fan of the original, but certainly not a ""must-own""."
2,Jeff Bridges Intolerable,The movie is not bad until Jeff Bridges shows up about half way through. And I think even I could have done his post fist fight make-up better. The obvious cotton roll stuck in his upper lip to indicate swelling was almost as annoying as his stupidly written character (not his fault) and his complete inability to play a menacing super creep.
3,The original was better,"Jeff Bridges is of course, always great but the ending is too Hollywood so I recommend watching the original version."
1,HORRIBLE HOLLYWOOD RIPOFF,"This movie is typical of Hollywood. They take a truly original European movie and dumb it down for American audiences. If you want to see a truly original, frightening movie that will stay with you DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!!! Buy or rent the orginal Dutch verision. That movie is worth seeing several times over. This movie is not."
1,Worst remake ever....spoilers....,"Many decry Hollywood remaking great European and Asian films nowadays, but they were doing it many years ago. This is a great example of the sickness of Hollywood. This film trashes everything that made the original unique and scary, and tacks on one of the most asinine, childish, unbelieveable happy endings I've ever seen.This film should be thrown out into the nearest incinerator, it's that bad. They added a girlfriend for Keifer's character (the original film just concentrated on the boyfriend's obsession with his missing girlfriend), they make the normally brilliant Jeff Bridges speak with a strange accent and look greasy, and the ending (which is so different from the original) is disgustingly conventional, cheap, and stupid. Despite the fact that George Sluzier directed both the original and this remake, this remake sucks. Don't see it. See only the original."
4,This movie is better than the original but see the original,"It is funny how some reviewers badly rated this movie. Ironicaly, the remake was done by the same director of the original. I would say this is by far a more exiting version but for serious movie fans, I recomend you to watch the original."
3,Nice movie,"Excellent movie for those ""Jack Bauer"" 24 fans. The movie was good and the ending surprised."
2,See the original,"I had seen the original before the release of this film. I think it would make an excellent case study on just how badly Hollywood can mangle real cinema. Plot is almost exactly like original except that it has a ridiculous, hoaky, happy ending that was added to the end. The other annoying change is that the eerily 'normal' family-man psycho has been substituted with an obvious greasey slime-ball 'bad guy.' If you can stand subtitles, get the original, because this is drivel in comparison."
1,Skip this one-see the original,This is what happens to wonderful foreign films when Hollywood decides to remake them. Instead of an intelligent psychological thriller we get Nancy Travis saving her boyfriend from the creepy Jeff Bridges. Typical Hollywood editing leads to a typical ending. Skip this one and go for the original which is much better.
2,Tepid Thriller,"This is a maddening film because it starts out promisingly but quickly dissipates in the second half to typical Hollywood schlock thriller. For the first hour or so the film was reminiscent of Hitchcock's work. Superb performances were on display particularly by Nancy Travis. Oddly, the worst performance on hand is by Jeff Bridges who previously I never thought capable of bad work. He affects some implacable accent that makes you scratch your head and not think him menacing. Pacific Northwest maybe? Whatever, this flick typifies mediocrity and elicits ennui instead of genuine terror."
1,1988 vs. 1993,"It is interesting to read the other customer reviews and see how some can actually see this version (1993) as the better of the two or really any good at all. I was not aware of the 1988 version and cought this version (1993) on television and thought it was mildly interesting. Then I watched the 1988 Dutch/French version and was really sorry that I had even seen the 1993 version first. It totally ruins the interesting way the story weaves -- and the way the 1993 version ends is just so perfectly Hollywood, it makes me want to lose it. Whereas, the 1988 version ends perfectly cold. I would like to know why in the world Sluzier would re-make his own great movie and make it into a bad Hollywood film?!?!?"
5,Extreme Suspense!!!,"This movie maybe a remake, but it keeps you at the edge of your seat. You don't ever want to get up. You always want to know what is going to happen next. It is a great mystery and it is very realistic! 5 stars for a great movie!"
3,"Not as bad as everyone says, but still no match to original","This remake of Sluzier's own 1988 Dutch thriller (this also being directed by him) stays fairly true to the original until, as mentioned before, the ghastly ending, which destroys the film.Performances are fine. This film is full of actors I do not like but I must admit I did like their performances. Sutherland gives a find obsessive performance. Bullock is sweet and charming (making her outcome quite horrific) and Bridges is quite creepy, though he still doesn't beat the suave, calm and calculating performance given by Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu in the original.While it definitely still wasn't meeting with the original, this thriller was doing quite fine and remained fairly smart, but it is destroyed by the ""happy"" ending. The original scared me, leaving an incredible and haunting impression and the final images are burned in my mind forever. This remake is barely passable Hollywood entertainment at best."
3,In the blink of an eye.,"The Vanishing starring Jeff Bridges, Sandra Bullock, and Kiefer Sutherland was a much ignored film from 1993. Bullock wasn't a household name yet and Sutherland was just starting to show his acting chops. I like Sutherland in this film, his performance is haunting and intense. I think this film is based on another film, parts of this film are slow and tepid but great acting from the cast and interesting storyline, give this sleeper of a thriller a chance."
3,"So bad, it's good...","Let me first say that this movie is not the best horror I've ever seen. In fact, the animatronics are horrible, and several parts of the movie are just plain ridiculous.However, somehow I found myself liking this movie. I can't explain why, but it is definately worth renting, or buying, since the price is right.I will warn you that unless you are a hard-core horror movie watcher or like semi-corny movies, you probably will not like this movie."
4,A Sequel That Doesn't Suck!,"Leonard's latest is dynamite read and is sure to be a hell of a movie too. The Chili Palmer and Linda Moon characters come alive with fresh dialogue and clever plot twists. It's satirical take on Hollywood and the music business is reminicent of Frank McConnell's ""The Frog King."" A fine read from start to finish. After all, how many books have a 300 pound, gay, half Simoan bodyguard trying to break into show business?"
2,"as flaccid as ""get shorty"" was tight","a huge disapointment after the savvy, funny ""get shorty"", ""be cool"" ranks with leonard's weakest. a poor xerox o0f his earlier tough-guy novels, be cool has all the standard leonard elements--thwe ambitious black gangster, the tough broad, etc., but scarcely a word rings true--the whole thing comes off like a parody of his earlier work.he pads the already sketchy book with half-assed chat about the record business (betraying very little real insight) and bad song lyrics. chili palmer should havwe been left un-sequeled. in short, an obvious contract fulfiller that bores rather than entertains."
1,Big disappointment,"The only thing that redeemed this book (unless you count the pat story line, trite dialogue and thin characterization) was Chili Palmer's uncanny ability to evoke the voice of John Travolta. I LOVED Get Shorty and was hoping that Be Cool would ""one-up"" it -- but it barely held my attention."
1,Sequels Suck,"Wow, I was really disappointed with this book. Mr. Leonard has written much better books and ,hopefully, will write better books. This book is totally half baked. The 'action' in the story is always told by Chili in conversation. And the Russian Mafia? Christ, someone should have told Elmore, ""NO"" If this were a movie and let's pray Travolta says ""NO"" it wouldn't even be a good dollar rental."
1,"I just couldn't finish this book, it was deadly boring!",My husband assured me that the pace would pick up mid-way through the book...after I'd read two-thirds it was still plodding along. The characters and the plot were trite...I had to stop wasting my time and put it on the bookshelf unfinished.
3,only but fair quality Leonard...,"Though I enjoyed parts of BE COOL, it is definitely not among Leonard's best. I often envision his work on the big screen. In this case, BE COOL follows one film generalization: the sequel is never as good as the original.Some funny parts, but there was also some lackluster pasts... Not the usual Leonard fare."
1,disapointing sequel,I was pretty disapointed in this sequel to get shorty - the main character is not nearly as street smart or as interesting as in the last story - the dialog is predicable and the humor is sparse
2,Worst Leonard I've read,"This novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries. In between the entertainment biz cliches, the author can only think to put various assination hits. some of the characters are interesting but not believable, and they certainly can't make up for the braindead plot. Read some of his other novels and skip this one."
5,Difference of Opinion,"I was amazed to see that Be Cool's average rating is 3 stars. I think it is one of Leonard's funniest, most insightful, and best."
2,I've read all his books - this one doesn't cut it,"This sequel to ""Get Shorty"" is about sequels. Clever, huh? Not clever enough. The dialogue was vintage Leonard (of course) but I just couldn't get into the story. It was just too 'cute' for me, too pat, too easy. Also a bit disjointed and hard to follow."
2,There's something cold about Cool.,"When I read Get Shorty, I thought wow! this is Elmore Leonard's masterpiece--or one of them. And when I grabbed a-hold of Be Cool, that was what I was expecting, another masterpiece. Well,it's not. It's disappointing and lifeless, and just WEAK! Chilli Palmer is a great character and deserves a better story than this: another behind-the-scenes shuffle, this time centered around the music industry. This setting only serves to showcase a group of weirdos and eccentrics who's sole purpose is to make Chilli look cool. My advice, just sit tight, be cool and wait for Elmore's next book--it has to be better than this."
2,A fast shallow read,"Sorry, Elmore, but this is not up to your sterling standards of the past. Playing off the popularity of Get Shorty and the movie of the same name starring John Travolta, Elmore Leonard has written a movie script that tries to pass as a novel. He should have called it B Movie."
3,Music World Doesn't Suit Chili,"Having enjoyed many of the movies based on Leonard's books (52 Pick-up, Get Shorty, and Out of Sight), I thought that I would venture into the purest of his art and read one of the novels firsthand. ""Be Cool"" features a great deal of insight into the music industry yet it didn't hold my attention well. I could hear Travolta uttering the lines of Chili Palmer, but some of the situations seemed highly implausible, from the relationship Chili has with the detective to his instant ability to manage a rock band. The ending was less than satisfying. If this is turned into a feature film, that part of the book will have to be ""manufactured."" Otherwise, the audience will fade out long before the film does."
2,Here's Hoping the Movie is Better than the Book,I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud.
2,Take the money and run,"I was very disappointed with Be Cool. Elmore Leonard is one of my favorite authors, but Hollywood had managed to convince Leonard to write this sequel to Get Shorty so it could be made into a movie. The main character, Chili Palmer, manages to walk through this totally lifeless story surrounding the record business. I recommend this book for diehard Elmore Leonard fans only."
2,Not Leonard's best.,"This story gets old quickly. It has, like Leonard's other books, some interesting characters, but they didn't hold my interest.I also grew tired of the idea that Chili Palmer was writing his movie as the story developed - that got old fast.This almost seemed like an idea for a film sequel that was jotted down and then fleshed out to fit a book.If you are a fan, as I am, you will enjoy this book enough, but it falls far below what I've come to expect from this author."
4,A great read,"Elmore rocks! But if you really want to rock, check out the Stone Coyotes new CD. They're the real-life band Elmore used as inspiration for the book."
2,A disappointment,"Believe me, I'm a fan. And I know that every swing of the bat can't be a home run. Still, this one was a disappointment. Anybody just starting on the Leonard body of work should bypass this one in favor of almost any of his others. I give it two stars ( instead of one ) simply because Leonard can't write anything but snappy, engaging dialogue."
1,dreary dialogue without content,this is a book of dreary and unrelated dialogue which goes on and on and accomplishes nothing unless one is interested in the use of five letter words. The plot is miniscule.
2,Don't guage Elmore by this Book,"I have, I believe, read every book that Elmore has written, and would rate this book one of his failures. The book, a sequel to ""Get Shorty,"" rambles for nearly 100 pages before it develops any sort of plot. I hope that Elmore goes back to Florida for his next book."
4,Be Cool: worms-eye view of pop music publishing,"Be CoolI enjoyed this title, as one completely unfamiliar with the pop music authoring and publishing scene. It's an unusual setting for an attention-grabbing murder mystery, and there's enough violence and intrigue to keep you turning the pages. Not much sex, but what there is, is honest. I did think it just a bit longish, and the main character simply too capable and connected for belief. As for the music-world characters' believability -- how would I know? Recommended."
4,Get Shorty it's not but still a great read,I couldn't wait for more Chili Palmer and this fills the bill. It's not as good but I really like Leonard's writing style and bizarre humor. A great read for vacation. won't make you think too much but will entertain you.
3,Better than Shorty,"The sequel to ""Get Shorty"" written 10 years later. The defies what normally happens in that the sequel is better than the original.This time Chili Palmer branches out into the music industry still living in Hollywood.This story has a lot more of Leonard's trade mark humour and violence and the characters are a bit more developed than in the original.A good read and its not necessary to read the first book , in fact its not recommended at all."
3,Negatives & Positives,"I am not a film student. I do not watch movies to gain some deep philosophical insight. I am open minded, however, and do not restrict my movie going experience to the latest drivel that Hollywood is churning out. That is the reason that I viewed this DVD twice. First on my own, then with the help of the commentary track. Here are my observations.I found myself scratching my head and/or yawning while watching the first time. What's up with the mimes in the jeep? What's the point of the antique shop/propeller? How did we get into this bizarre Yardbirds concert? Tennis anyone?I must say that the film was more enjoyable with the help of the commentary and the previous viewing. Although even the commentator couldn't explain the mimes, antique shop or propeller.My final assessment is that Antonioni was trying to make a commercial abstract film, which is an oxy-moron. Not enough of either to make this a success. Am I glad I saw it? Yes. Do I want to see it again? No way."
2,Falls apart,"I was embarrassed until the mystery of the park--and the need for the photographic blow-ups--established itself. (I am a child of the sixties. Were we really all that vain and all that vapid? Was our rhythm so challenged, our sex so silly, our highs so exaggerated?) But back to the engaging mystery. Let's return to the park. . .to the corpse. . .No, the film makers say, let's drop that for the nearby spectacle of a group of white-faced mimes watching a pretend game of tennis between two of their troupe. Oh, what a silly shame."
1,Bad Bad Bad Painful to watch,"After reading the backflap of this dvd it sounded like a great storyline. what a let down. the movie was slow, jumbled, with little direction and alot of confusion. what a waste of time. save your money and buy something good."
4,chronicle of an era,"This film made a very big impact on me in the sixties. I was living in London at the time and it captured a feeling that was in the air in the city at that time . It summed up the atmosphere in London for those of us who could not pinpoint or articulate what was going on behind all the ""parties""that lasted through the night and the music and fashions. Everyone of a particular age wanted to be like David Hemnings or thought they were like David Hemmings. The feeling the film gave was that you could be like David Hemmings at your own level. You didn't need the Rolls Royce. All you really needed was an slr camera and some clothes.I think that the true art of this picture is that it made you feel something. It made you really appreciate the time and the era that was then. I never get tired of watching it and even now after 35 years I still see now what I saw then.I was very saddened by the death of David Hemmings and the realisation that time passes so quickly."
1,"If you love this movie, forget this version","As a great fan of this movie when it first came out, I thought that the scenes in London's green park would last forever. Alas, the video has no color. What Antonioni worked so hard to acheive in visual delight is all mush....Perhaps the DVD can restore what's faded, but this is worthless."
2,Soundtrack Ruins Great Film,"I saw this film when it was released in theaters and its power has stuck with me for over 40 years. I was thrilled when it found out it had been released on DVD. Unfortunately, the soundtrack is so awful that it ruines an otherwise brilliant piece of film making. It is center speaker only and is of very low quality. Perhaps someday it will be re-released with the original soundtrack - in the meantime, save your money."
3,Short film,"I found it rather disturbing. The photographer was not an attractive person, and the plot was just wierd. But it killed a couple of hours on a rainy day."
3,Not aging well,"I think this is a more pretentious than Antonioni's other films-full of Austin Powers sets and human props. In films like La Notte the pace is sullen and slow but there was a humanity to the stories. There's a central event driving this story, but who cares about the murdered guy? Why should we? But the absolute worst part of the film is the ending, summing up the film with an invisible tennis ball."
1,excruciatingly boring,"It's a long time since i saw the movie, but i think i will always remember it as an excruciatingly boring experience. (I had to sit through because it was presented in a college course.) IN this movie, nothing happens--very very slowly."
5,They don't make 'em like this anymore,"With the exception of maybe David Lynch you rarely see mainstream movies tackle the basic questions of existence and perception. What Lynch did so well in Mullholand Dr., Antonioni does so well here. In addition, this boasts some of the best music ever put on film. Herbie Hancock's score can stand on its own with the best jazz of that era and the Yardbird's standing in for the director's choice band the Who do passably well."
1,Nothing There,"The movie is like this review. Nothing there. After watching it, I was mad at myself for wasting the time to watch it. Don't waste your time."
1,Oh Pleeeeeeze!,"This mod movie is a real ""get over yourself"" kinda film. I felt like I needed a beret & an espresso just to watch it. Sulky behavior, models in go-go boots and cigarettes does not a movie-make!"
1,Good example of how NOT to make movies,"A fashion photographer discovers a crime. So what??? Big Deal!!!The action is slow, boring and unrealistic.The photographer is arrogant and simply rude both tohis assistants, and to his customers. All actors are squareand unconvincig, schematic. All the action spins around thedaily activities of the photographer and his frozen face.I would understand, if this crap were made in 1920s, but hey!Wake up! The year is 1966! So, this piece of garbage is just an example how NOT to make movies. And I do not care how popular the actors were, and how great the director.Do not waste your time, unless you are A movie major and this one is in you Summer Viewing List."
1,Blow-Up main audio is sadly very poor quality,"The film may look good - but you've got to be able to hear it to enjoy it.The main audio only comes from the center speaker (the only DVD I own that does this) and is incredibly low in volume. Even when you crank your amp up to near maximum to hear it, you'll find that sole center signal sounds suspiciously like it's meant to be part of at least a 2.1 soundtrack. It completely lacks bass and the music has no presence.I've seen Blow-Up on the big screen in recent years, I know it can sound as good as it looks. Someone at Warners has made a big blunder in mastering this DVD. In its present format it's not worth buying or owning."
2,One thing to recommend it ...,"There is a scene where David Hemmings is in a club and the band on stage are the Yardbirds -- in that brief period where they had BOTH Jeff Beck AND Jimmy Page -- doing an altered version of ""The Train Kept A Rollin'"". Other than that ..."
3,only one reason to purchase this film,"this film has footage of the yardbirds with jimmy page and jeff beck both playing lead guitar on ""stroll on"".actually it's ""train kept a rollin"" but they were unable to acquire the rights so they rewrote it.there is no other footage of these future superstars together and beck left the band not long after.if your a zeppelin fan,yardbirds or jeff beck fan i recommend this film.the who were originally sought but turned it down.hence the guitar smashing bit."
3,mmm...,Well...I was under the impression of Zabrisky point. This movie is a bit slow...I didn't finish it...Maybe another day.
2,What?,"You can call me a Philistine, but this film bored me to tears. Many scenes are horribly dated. Now, that may not be a fair criticism, but I couldn't help but think of Austin Powers at times, which can be distracting when one is trying to watch such a terribly serious meditation on reality and illusion. The scenes involving the revelation of the mystery in the park via photograph were involving. I can also appreciate the fact that Antonioni wasn't interested in making a typical Hollywood-type thriller in which the hero learns all of the secrets and punishes the wrong-doers. There were glimpses of a good film here, but that's all.Besides, any film with a scene in which mimes are taken seriously loses me."
2,"Funky 60s Look, Some Interesting Scenes, Not Much Else","Gotta love the flashback to the sixties that is reflected in every scene of this movie (of course, it was just a product of its time--the mid-60s--it's not a film trying to recapture the era..it IS the era). Still the storyline is slim and the going slow. Interesting scenes appear here and there. The parts are definitely better than the whole. There's an intriguing idea in here it just never gets developed as it should. Actually, thinking about it in retrospect is more interesting than watching it was. It's subtle, I'll grant you that. And a nice character study....and yet....?We were counting the minutes left in the film by the end (""Only 25 minutes left in the film and then we can get back to our lives!"") so that's not a good sign."
2,"Buy the soundtrack, read the book, skip the film","I watched this film recently after having enjoyed the soundtrack for years. I found the film to be weak on suspense, character development, and pacing. The plot was nearly absent. I suppose the style of photography and editing could be useful to a student of film history, but for the rest of us who actually want to see a movie that we can be pulled in by and enjoy, this is an utter waste of time. I don't know how Cortazar felt about this adaptation of his work, but I'm sure it wasn't a happy feeling."
2,GREAT FILM - VERY BADLY PRODUCED DVD,"How can Warner Brothers get away with such aweful sound and compression! This is really a badly done dvd of a great movie. I am happy to own it on dvd, but it is a very disappointing dvd."
5,One of the all time bests,"Blowup is one of the greatest films ever made. It will make you think long after the film is over and will leave you with images that you will never forget. This DVD release is pretty good. It has the OAR which is the main sticking point for me. The audio is a little off on the low ends, but unless you have a huge system and look for that kind of thing then I don't think it would bother you."
4,Blow-Up (1966),"""Nothing like a little disaster to sort things out.""Blowup isn't a precise film in its execution, but its moderate disfunction sharpens the edge with which it cuts into viewers and judges societal desolation with great efficiency and power. It is photographed beautifully, and its photographing within the picture is linear to the physical presentation of a fashion-based yet common culture. This is a terrific film."
4,"Absolutely Great Film, absolutely worthless commentary.","It's tragic, not giving this disc 5 stars. The film deserves more then 5 stars. But the commentary, is so unbelievably poor, it's almost beyond belief. It's as if this person hasn't seen it in a while, and just gave some worthless criticisms as he watched it for the second time.I've had discussions with friends while watching this film that would be 100 times more interesting, and enlightening.Like someone else suggested, please Criterion, do a serious release of this phenomenal film."
4,My Three year old loves this!!!!,"My 3 y.o. loves motorcycles and has been wearing this daily since getting it about 5 weeks ago. It's actually meant for a larger child but, I was able to put a few stiches in the suspenders to shorten it for a smaller boy. Watch out, this costume is not built for wear and tear. I've spent a fair amount of time sewing wheels back in place. But, if it's just for trick or treating... IT'S GREAT!!!"
4,Very Readable,"There are many VERY valuable sections to this book. The author explores the different Greek definitions of ""love"" with amazing clarity and verbal dexterity (the book is the written version of a live seminar). I found it very valuable and am happy to recommend it."
4,Wanted,"I thought this was going to be another low grade, straight to video movie, but I was quite impressed. The photography, direction, and acting was well done. It was intelligently written and had well developed characters.It is a coming of age story about a young man on the run from the law and the mob. He runs away to a Catholic school for boys and hides out. While there he gets a job and helps out with the kids. He teaches the kids right from wrong and in turn learns a thing or two himself. He befriends a priest who helps him choose the right path. In the end he gets the girl and lives happily ever after.The story line to this movie is pretty basic and straight forward, but is enjoyable none the less."
2,Not just a walk in the park,"This is a basic guide to taking a dog into the wilderness. There is plenty of commonsense advice about first aid, supplies, andoutdoor etiquette (i.e. yield to horses and clean up if your dog poops on the trail). The downside is that it assumes that you can take your pet just about anywhere--like across rivers and onto ledges--and that leashes are optional. For seasoned outdoorsfolk and dogs that are both suited to and trained for such adventures, fine, but that's probably not most of us.Also distracting is the sheer number of spelling and grammatical mistakes. ""Dogs,"" for example, is consistently used as a possessive form, while apostrophes are used to designate the plural. And I won't even go into ""its"" and ""it's."" Any decent editor should have found these in the draft stage. Rightly or wrongly, such errors undermine the reader's faith in the writer's expertise."
3,No so bad,"This is the first ""Dog hiking""-book I've seen that has something for the more difficult situations. The book has even short chapter about things like fording and bouldering. It still has the basics too.No photos, just drawn pictures. Not very informational ones, except the ones about first aid.Good book, but a bit short. Especially if you do longer, overnight hikes in difficult terrain. LaBelle's book ""Guide to backpacking with your dog"" is definetly better if you do shorter walks that last only a day. If you decide to buy it, avoid 1st edition. The 2nd edition is definetly improved version."
5,Definately Worth A Look,"Smooth transaction. Arrived quickly and in good condition. Quality of item meets my expectations. Heavy base holds lens and ""hands"" steady. Very happy with item, price and vendor. Would definately order from this vendor again. I use this at work for soldering and positioning small components. Works great!"
3,Works...,"Functional. Shipped Very Quickly. Good deal for the price. It is a little light, but it will work well for smaller projects."
1,not a helpful helping hand,"I am actually returning this item because it is not at all sturdy. If the magnifier is not positioned exactly correctly it will tip over. There are much better helping hands out there for the same price or less. My suggestion would be to not buy one with a magnifier as it gets in the way anyway, but instead get an Optivisor or some sort of magnifier to wear that moves out of the way easily. I ended up going to my local jewelry supply store and buying two separate helping hands, which gave me much more versatility. The brand I bought is Ikohe, but there are many out there. Best to see it in person if possible."
4,Third set of hands helps,This product works well. You really need to tighten down all the locations so the hands or magnifying glass don't move around on you.
4,Handy!,This tool helps so much when making jewelry...needed this for years. Only complaint is that it can and does tip over occasionally.
5,ultima thule: review of polar concerns,"this book is exquisitely presented & an in depth analysis of the plight of the polar inuit society by jean maulaurie. very worth while, if you care about these forgotten, and marginalized people....otherwise, go aboutmaking more money and don't bother. thea, dedicated bookworm:) & polarenthusiast."
2,Very bad sequel,"I can say am not a 5-star Highlander fan, but I like it a lot. So, when I watched the first movie of the saga, I was very enthusiastic about watching the sequel. So, I got the renegade version because I knew that the ""Zeist idea"" was taken out of the plot. But even that, we can't say too much about this movie, only that the plot is a little bit better. Poor acting, bad script, bad optical effects (note that when Ramirez is on the airplane, in the first shot is shown that the sky is totally red, but when the camera turns inside of the airplane, you can see the sun out of the window!!!!), poor dialogues, and the idea of putting Ramirez inside the plot again was not taken in the sense of giving him an important role in the movie. In overall, I know why fans don't think as this movie as a true sequel."
1,I wanted to render myself blind...with a rusty spoon...,"This is an awful movie. Make no sense, butchers the feel of the first movie and further more most of the ""new"" characters are lame as hell. When I saw this for the first time as a little kid I remember thinkning ""Oh my god...none of this makes sense."" Think perhaps it was my young mind jsut couldn't grasp it, I have instead come to the conclusion that I was a perceptive child. Watch the first one instead."
1,Terrible movie worst sequel,"This is movie is terrible. It is a lot more scientific than the other ones or the show. It focuses too much on the fact that the sun has been destroyed and the sky is red. The first half hour of the movie shows Christopher Lambert's character (Connor MacLeod) as a old man. Saying that he has claimed the prize and lived his life up to become an old man. Then it tosses u a completely different story then from the first one. It says that Connor MacLeod and Juan Ramirez(Sean Connery) are punished by becoming immortal and being sent to the future as in the renegade version and to earth from the planet Zeist in the original. And it claims that there are more immortals form the Planet Zeist or from the past that can challenge MacLeod thus making him immortal again. And then MacLeod can call Juan Ramirez even though he's been killed to help him. I dont recommed this movie. If u saw the first one and liked it, see Highlander 3 the final dimension, and highlander endgame."
2,"No Planet Zeist? GOOD, Added Rude Scenes - BAD!","I was all set to enjoy a different version of Highlander 2 when, in the first scene, the main character walks up to some strange woman and has sex with her up against a stone wall. Since when was our main character so rude and crude? Not my cup of tea. I watched this when I purchased it a few years ago so can't remember much else to comment on. Just a bad movie any way it is cut or added to."
2,"Is this the version where he stays with woman til she is old, grey, dies?","Is this the version where he stays with the woman til she is old, grey and dies?That is the version I saw and want to buy and see again. Remember Queen's music, saw 1, 2, 3 at theater, hoped for help in reviews. the 3rd one was not worth repeating, perhaps II. Who was the woman I yearned for, even aged, with silver grey hair, was reminded by commercial with similar woman, 30 years, now 65 Plus one on Sept 17th. - Tom (bluepuma)Will stick with David Arkenstone CD's purchase otherwise."
1,Shew.,"A total stinkbomb. A real PVC-plugger. Let's see, take a reasonably decent first film with an interesting Sci-Fi/Fantasy premise and totally flush it down the loo and make up some bull about being aliens from another planet?Was Sean Connery that desperate for money? Hadn't he just won an Oscar a couple of years earlier in The Untouchables?And what was the deal with the flying skateboards?"
2,"The good, the bad, and the ugly","This version is 100 times better than the US theatre release. It is also 1000 times worse than almost any movie ever made. In the fan scene, I guess Sean had been training with Yoda. However, there are some saving graces, including the morgue sequece and Sean walking in on a Shakespearean play. But the airplane ride, the Back to the Future 2 flying skateboards and the fact that Chris Lambert can't play an old man really hurt this ""film"". There are lots of in jokes, but most of them aren't funny. Instead of building on anything, it tries to explain it. I dub Highlander III as ""The Apology"" for this."
2,Not as bad as it's reputation,"Okay, it's probably the worst ""Highlander""-movie, but the good news is that the ""renegade""-version is better than the ""normal"" one...still: As a sequel to the classic ""Highlander"" this picture fails (which is why part 3 and 4 simply don't mention this one anymore).If you go for the strange story and atomosphere (which isn't bad), you will probably have fun watching Sean Connery, as well as Michael Ironside as the bad guy and some great set-designs, but far too less action (=swordfighting).All in all ""there should have been only one""!"
2,An example of a sequel that shouldn't have been made,"What's going on here? Connor MacLeod and Ramirez (who was killed in the first movie) are now aliens from another planet sent to the future to stop an evil immortal and take down a shield that Connor originally created to protect Earth and replace the ozone layer! Sure! This is a movie that never should have been made, although Michael Ironside has some good one-liners and the special effects are OK. Christopher Lambert's voice as an old Connor in 2024 is hilarious, too. I must warn those who never seen this film: Don't watch this movie because it has absolutely nothing to do with the original Highlander, which is a great movie."
2,Boring!,"Could this movie have possibly been any more boring than it was. I really didn't like this movie at all, and ""Highlander"" is one of my favorite movies. I considered ""Highlander"" to be a classic, and this movie was just a disgrace to ""Highlander"" fans. Giving this movie 2 stars was really being too kind."
2,You'd need a renegade version to save this mess,"I'd heard how bad Highlander II was so when it was on the SciFi channel I watched it just to see for myself. That mess mostly ignored the first movie, just took a few bits and used them in a completely different way to how Highlander I presented itself. What were they thinking of with the Alien concept? I don't see how this movie could be reedited into something sensible and I won't pay the money to find out, buy it at your own risk."
1,I watched this so you don't have to!,"For the love of Pete, stay AWAY from this revolting garbage masquerading as film. If you want to watch a bad film that's funny-bad, go buy BATTLEFIELD EARTH or DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. But no one is laughing over this ... this project (I cannot call it a film). It is not worth your time. Do not even rent it thinking ""it can't be as bad as all that."" It *is* that bad. I promise you.Acting? bad. Directing? bad. Writing? there is no single word that can sum up the awful, pitiful atrocity that is the script to this miserable work. It's so bad, it made me dislike the first film; it's so bad, it makes the other Highlander sequels look good; it's so bad, that to this day I avoid other films by the same writer and director. It is THAT BAD."
1,Worst Sequel EVER,Did someone lose a bet? I am beyond baffled as to HOW this movie was ever made. Shame on Chris Lambert and Especially Shame on Sean Connery. And as BAD as this one was the 3rd came in a close second.
2,Highlander 2,"I have all the versions of this movie, can't decide which is best. Ah the first one ((( Highlander )))"
2,Bad...but had a cool look,"This is a bad movie. I cannot beign to describe the plot...let's just say, ""Stuff happens...and then they fight."" I give it two stars because it has a nice look. Like a low-rent Gotham City."
4,SEAN CONNERY,"THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS BECAUSE SEAN CONNERY WAS IN IT AGAIN, BUT IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE TOO."
1,A dreadful movie!,This is quite simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the original Highlander.The plot was thin and had little basis from the original movie. The acting was dreadful and brought nothing to the film.Quite simply I recommend that you note spend your money on this movie.
1,the worst sequel ever to mankind,"I had seen highlander 1 a number of times and i still like it, i saw this movie 2 times,i had to see if the first time i saw it that it was a highlander film and i would have to say it was one of the worst film i had ever seen, the only the good thing about this movie is that sean connery is in it and he wasent even needed.SO id give it 1/10 because of sean connery.ps dont watch it if you like the first one"
1,COULD ANYONE IMAGINE A WORSE MESS?,"At least H2 was consistent: The worst scripting, worst directing, worst acting, worst casting, worst editing and worst everything else I've ever seen in a movie. It's the George Bush of movies.What's worse is that they took one of the best premises around, the HIGHLANDER concept, and so messed and muddled it. In my book this mucked-up monster has replaced BATTLEFIELD EARTH as the most incomprehensible waste of money in cinematic history. (Whew. I feel better. Not much though; but the bad mental taste is somewhat exorcised.)"
1,One of the worst films ever to be screened,"The immortal from the first ""Highlander"" saves the Earth from it's decaying o-zone layer by placing a sheild over the entire planet to block out the sun. But after a few decades, the Earth has become a very ugly place and the highlander (who is no longer immortal) and a resurrected Sean Connery are on a mission to destroy the sheild which will supposedly bring life back to Earth. That appears to story line. But this film is so incredibly boring that its very easy to lose track of its tedious, hopeless, confussing plot. This movie is so bad that its almost worth watching just to see how bad a movie really can be. Its full of many elements that totally contadict the original and make it all the more confussing. Not even Sean Connery's performance was able to save it. You really have to wonder what brand of cigarettes the producers were smoking when they approved this script. The Director's Cut is also available and is reportedly much easier to understand."
1,Beyond Bad,"The first movie was one of my all time favorites, so I was thrilled to find out that there would be a sequel. I knew Michael Ironside would be a villan (good call), and somehow Sean Connery would be back (I wasn't sure how, considering he had died, but I was willing to suspend disbelief).What a profound disappointment.The sequel was as bad as the original was good. They completely ignore any continuity and disavow the story line. I mean... my god!Words fail to describe just how bad this movie is."
2,the most confusing movie i've ever seen,making a sequel to the original highlander was a very stupid idea. and what do you get? a stupid sequel.
1,Loved Highlander...What movie is THIS thing a sequel to??,"Okay, I'm not going to get all critical here and analyze all the little points and argue continuity etc. etc. This movie just plain sucks. If you loved HIGHLANDER, don't buy this movie. Rent it, borrow it from a friend, be creative and make up a sequel on your own, but don't buy it. Sorry folks, but an appearance by Connery doesn't save a movie this terrible. Campy, hokey, cheesy and lame are good words to use in describing this movie. Truly an insult to any fan following of the original. Amazon doesn't have a 1/2 star rating -- if they did this movie qualifies."
1,Ahhhh! Badness!,"PAIN! That is what this movie is. PAIN! I loved the original Highlander, it was fantastic and is one of my top ten movies, but this... thing... doesn't even deserve the whole star I gave it. The story itself is stupid, and to make it even worse, it totally contradicts the first movie. I'm guessing the third Highlander was a way for the writer's to say ""we're sorry."" This movie was dull, stupid, and senseless. The one and only thing that it has going for it, is that the writer's know how to write comedy."
1,Perhaps the worst sequel ever...,"While I have not yet seen the DVD of this film, let me tell you what happened when I went to see it in the theatre upon its original release. I was a huge fan of the first Highlander film so I was eagerly anticipating the sequel which was helmed by the same director (Russel Mulcahey). After about 5 minutes, it was obvious this film was going to be an utter waste of time. About 20 minutes into it, it's getting even worse. A guy in front of me in the theatre is joined by his friend who arrives late. ""What'd I miss?"" asks the friend. The guy says, ""It's sometime in the future and Ridley Scott is president!"" That's about the most generous thing you can say about this horrible sequel to a terrific film. END"
1,Laugh,"I have to say that I haven't seen this Renegade Version, even though I have already purchased it (I'm a Highlander FANATIC, so I just had to do it), but the original Highlander II has to rank way down there with Dragon Heart, First Knight and other really cheesy action/fantasy flicks. What where they thinking? I highly recommend Highlander I, and I am sure you will watch it at least 10 times within a month and become addicted like me. But if you spend more than dime on this one, you will curse yourself, and the idiots who made it. END"
3,DVD on Blu-ray,I was a bit dissapointed as I expected more features on the Blu-ray than the DVD. I have the dvd and didn't see much change.
1,Reviewing this Out of Spite,"I'm with ScottyMcD on this one. I first saw the original Highlander when I was about 17 (ten years ago...ugh) and I thought it was pretty damn cool. A bit cheesy, yes; not the greatest acting, yeah; but it had a lot of style. After seeing the first film I thought I would check out the sequels and I was just like...wtf? For a while there I had trouble watching the original Highlander because I kept thinking about all of the so-called ""back story"" that we were shown in the second one. Thankfully I have been able to put most of the movie out of my mind and am now able to enjoy the original again. All I have to say to those who have seen the first movie and none of the sequels is that I wish I were you."
1,Still sucks after all those versions.,"Heh. Guess what? The theatrical version was bad and made no sense, but this ""Renegade Version"", making SLIGHTLY more sense, is equally bad - AND longer. Do not waste your time and money, dude. You'll miss it later. Word."
4,sequels,"When I first seen this movie on VHS nearly 9 years ago, I thought it was good, but too short (with it only 90 minutes back then). The Renegade Version on DVD not only shows the same scenes from the theatrical version, but this special edition adds 19 minutes of extra footage that was never shown. I thought the storyline was kinda confusing, but it's still pretty entertaining. Christopher Lambert is good in this film, but James Bond himself, Sean Connery nearly stole the whole show on the brief scenes he had."
1,Garbage,"This movie was garbage. It was stupid, horrible, moronic,... I hate that a talented actor like Sean Connery was involved in this crap. What a horrible movie. If you liked the first one... don't see this garbage. Virginia Madsen could not save it by getting naked and revealing her beautiful body (which I must also state was so stupid. She just sees this horrible actor Christopher Lambert appear out of nowhere on the street and is compelled to screw him against a brick wall even though she has never seen him before and they do not even speak). This movie is so bad Ed Wood should be rolling over in his grave. HORRIBLE!!!"
1,Theatrical Version is better.,You should buy the old version on VHS or laser-disc instead of this half baked trash. Robocop 2 was a way worse movie.
1,Pants sci-fi,"This is a huge let down. As the bad guy, Michael Ironside does a pretty good job but the movie is such a stinker it floats in the water. Avoid.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
1,This [stinks],"Everything with this movie [stinks]...(Not even Sean Connery is good), The love scene between the girl and macleod is unneccesary.The worst movie ever!DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!"
1,Boy this really was terrible .....,"I have seen all of the Highlander series movies. This one is a head above the rest when it comes to stinking up the screen. It's hard to believe that a great actor like Sean Connery associated himself with this garbage. But even with Connery, this movie lacks any kind of acting. Some of the [stuff] they try to pull with this storyline is unbelievable even by sci-fi film standards.And did I mention the plot of this movie? Probably not because I couldn't find one to mention."
2,A Famously Bad Concept,"Time has not been kind to my perspective of Highlander 2, not as kind as the 2 stars I'm giving it. I enjoyed Connery's performance, particularly how Ramierez coped with being reincarnated several centuries forward from when he was beheaded. However, the recasting of the original premises (the immortals are aliens, the way McLeod was restored his youth, the shield that guarded Earth, etc. etc.) gave me a lot of ""huh, whatwuzzat! "" moments that annoy me any time this movie and I cross paths. Not quite a primer on how not to make a sequel, but close; only the presence of Lambert and Connery give this movie any likeability. Most Highlander fans treat this movie as if it never existed. Take the hint."
1,Planet Zeist?? Hello???,"After Connor MacLeod killed Kurgan in 1985, he took a nap and had a horrible nightmare. He dreamed that he was not really Scottish, but from another planet, and that he could revive his teacher, Ramirez, buy just calling his name during a Quickening. What?! His nightmare became brutally worse when he saw what a mockery the second movie had become. The movie thankfully ended and Connor finally woke up from his nightmare. Connor was in Seacouver WA, in 1992, helping out his former pupil Duncan Macleod, in the best sequel to the first movie- the first episode of Highlander-The Series."
3,Why is it like this?,"I thought the movie was alright except for the fact that it started in the past. The past of what?! When in Earth's past was there a race of humans with the power to send themselves into the future? And when they did get sent to the future, how come MacLeod was mortal until he was stabbed by the Kurgan. He grew up in that town... he had cousins and stuff... he didn't suddenly appear one day out of thin air like the guys in this one did. That, and why did MacLeod just remember that he was born in the deep past and was the leader of an army along with Ramirez? What makes someone forget that?! With all of the plot wholes, it still had good action and Sean Conery."
1,stupid IMMORTALS,I saw the movie ...and then i bought the renegade dvd version because they claimed that they modified the movie ...some claim! Yes they erased the ZEIST plotline which really screwed my head! If they were aliens on an alien world how come they retained their names that were of earth origin! HOW MANY ALIENS HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED WITH THE NAMES MCLOUD & RAMIREZ? ... And then Lambert is seen holding it in his final confrontation with Ironside. The director didnt explain how he found Ramirez one of a kind blade? regardless of what people say the only original and entertaining HIGHLANDER MOVIE IS THE FiRST ONE FORGET THE SEQUELS AND THAT PATHETIC adrian paul! DO YOURSELVES A FAVOUR AND BURN THIS...
1,Highlander 2 - The Sickening,I saw this in the theater when it came out. The intense pain in my head finally snapped about 20 minutes into the movie and I spent the rest of the film laughing hysterically. It was either that or death by a bad movie. It took me years to recover from this thing. Then earlier this year I saw Battelfield Earth (don't get me started) and it gave me Highlander 2 flashbacks all over again. Doesn't this thing violate the Geneva convention? Somebody pass a law NOW! OH MY GOD IS IT BAD! I will NEVER watch this film again (unless Mystery Science Theater 3000 comes back and rips it to shreds) The pain...The pain...Please make it STOP!
1,A Prime Example of the Absence of Intelligence,"I whole-heartedly agree with the other reviews as to the quality of this movie. All things pertaining to this second edition of the Highlander series aught to be gathered together and destoyed. Having said that, if you are a loyal Highlander fan and must have this film just because it is Highlander don't waste time with the original version. The editing on that version left much to be desired and the film became choppy and made little sense. The Renegade version re-introduces some of those much needed scenes and is the only reason this movie gets a star at all. Just keep in mind that this is not the Highlander that we know and love."
1,Don't buy this it is awful,"One of the worst movies ever made - and not it a good way.Whatever you do, don't buy it."
1,DO NOT buy this!!!,"I wish I could think of something positive about this...but I CAN'T!!! It Sucks BIG time!!!Ok, cast your mind back to Highlander 1...Connor Mcleod, born into a scottish highland family & eventually forced into exile as his relatives don't understand his mortality.Well it turns out he's not scottish, but an alien!!?? from the planet Ziest!??Ok, if anyone still reading this hasn't lost the will to live I'll carry on. Actually, is there any point? Look, connor mcleod has to save the earth from a gigantic shield that's covering the earth & causing major global warming, but by the time you realise this you'd be happy if the whole damn planet got fried its that bad!I'm sorry, but just reviewing this movie is getting me depressed, I'll sign off now, if I can find my copy of scarface I'll be happy, otherwise I'm off to slit my wrists...bye!"
1,Likely to disappoint,"After Highlander (which I would rate at 5 stars),I went out to buy this sequel. It was shocking. The idea of McLeod portrayed as an old man with a ridiculous, emphysemic voice put me off right at the start and ruined my idea of the original Scottish hero. The plot was virtually purposeless with fight scenes happening for no apparent reason! In my opinion, Mulcahy has directed a MAJOR flop and one can only feel embarrased for Lambert and Connery who I believe were grossly misused in this disappointing movie."
1,Never again!,"Unless you are lucky enough to own the director's cut edition of this film, I suggest that you stay away from this version. It is bad, bad, bad. It completely stains the original concept and idea behind the immortals. It is badly casted, badly acted, badly shot, and just bad all over. I sat through the whole thing once and that was it. For some reason, the immortals are aliens in this version, and they come to Earth to find Connor MacLeod and kill him. The rest of the film is just as stupid. Even the fighting sequences are boring. Trust me: You are better off with the original film, or the TV show. It may change a few things, but not as badly as this horrible film version did. Skip it, at all costs."
3,It works better like an imaginative science fiction. It is fun to watch.,"If you see some explanations about the second Highlander movie, you'll discover that this story happens in a different dimension. The immortals involved are thrown in a distant future (for the age it was done) in a planet Earth condemned by the absence of the ozone skin.Highlander 2 is that, a science fiction story. Of course this cannot be considered in the usual mithology, because this is not our reality. It's more like what happened if Connor, Ramirez and Katana had be thrown in a dimension in witch Connor's last wife and the rest of the world had died by radiation.The story is good, a little slow, but flows nice. The science fiction plot is interesting, the atmosphere is a little like Blade Runner. And Ironside here are deliciously sadic and insane, he's still evil, but funny at the same time.All in all, a good movie. Not the best of the franchise, but worths watch without been considered as part of the original mithology."
2,Nothing like a class,"Do not buy this book. It is not Matlab, nor even C++ it's like a book bout a monkey who's learning matlab. Matlab is already outdated by C++.Secondly There are better companion books."
3,Textbook,An ok beginning guide but I had a hard time figuring out functions that were listed online or part of toolbox extensions. Kindle Ed. would have been nice.
5,was nice and new,the book was worth it. it comes in handy. im happy with it.killing words blah blah blah blah blah
4,first course in symbolic algebra,"Pratap teaches the latest version of Matlab to someone who need never have encountered symbolic algebra before. The basics are covered in enough detail to get you up and running with Matlab. Hopefully so that you can decide if your problems are suitable for tackling with Matlab, and if so, how to get input a problem and extract an answer.This guide understandably does not give the full scope of Matlab's abilities. That is left for more advanced texts. Pratap's book is suitable for an undergraduate level course."
5,Great Introduction,"I found this to be a well written, easy to comprehend introduction to MatLab programming. I had programs written and running within the first two hours of reading it. Makes a great quick reference as well."
5,Good For Inside,This flag is only one sided so its great for a wall flag but not great if you want to hang one outside in my opinion. I got what i paid for and i am impressed for the price.
4,Weird & Listenable -- Always A Great Combination,"I had this CD for about a year before I got around to listening to it (I had not heard the originals). I was more than pleasantly surprised. I am not what you would call avant-garde -- I like Elvis, Merle Haggard, & power pop -- but I love this CD. It's weird but very listenable -- always a great combination in my book -- and not really classifiable (The ""Peter Gunn Theme"" played on an out-of-tune guitar? Over-EQed drums? Sure, why not). And the ""hick"" countdown on ""Rocket Ship"", intentional or not, is a hoot. Obviously a labor of love. Certain hits (on Venus): ""Walking the Cow"" and ""Rocket Ship"". But there's a lot more after those two grabbers."
5,powerful storytelling at it's best,"Buy this book, if only to read the stories for inspiration. Elizabeth Ellis and Loren Niemi possess a level of compassion, maturity and skill that can mentor any storytelling risk-taker through the delicate task of using Truth - the real kind, the scary kind, the kind that sets you free - as the source for powerful stories. This is not a book about theories...this is a book about what they do, what has worked for them and what has worked for others they've taught in their workshops. It has worked for me, I highly recommend it."
4,A very clinical view of an activist organization.,"Dolgin's book is a very valuable resource to anyone interested in the history of the Jewish Defense League. While very clinical in its approach and appealing to academia in its style, it is worthwhile reading and provides an invaluable resource about what has become one of the most notable organizations in recent Jewish history."
4,My Review,"Amazon service was good.Microsoft Office is goodThe program that came with the package, Virtual PC,could not find the modem in my Mac ibook."
1,Why,I don't understand why anyone would bother spending over $400 for Microsoft Office for Mac. Openoffice 2 is now available FREE (as always)
3,"Acceptable product, a bit overpriced, watch out for font issues. Don't buy for Intel Macs!","First: Product is pricey. Avoid it unless you absolutely need it.Second: Bad interoperability between Mac and Windows versions. If you use the grab utility to copy/paste screenshots into Word, etc. and expect the document you created to open on a PC, better have Quicktime and TIFF decompressor. (Who had that bright idea?)Third: Virtual PC DOES NOT WORK on Intel Macs. Best platform is PPC G4/G5. It's a CPU hog on G3, even if you max out your RAM.Fourth: Here's the kicker. Better get a hold of software like Font Doctor and make sure you're running OS X 10.4+. Corrupt fonts will cause Office apps to crash and burn. Recommend removing all fonts except OS-provided fonts, run font doctor and repair all fixable fonts, then use the Font Book supplied by OS X Tiger (10.4) to bring them back in. Don't forget to reboot between removing fonts and re-adding them. You'll save a world of trouble in doing this."
5,Microsoft Office 2004 (MAC),"I have been a Mac user for 20 years because I like its straight forward approach to computer. , In my work environment I have become a great fan of Office for PC's. Mac now has a program with the same power that PC's have had for years. A great program."
3,Good program-but look around,"This is a very good program. In fact, it's an excellent program.The question is, though, is it excellent enough? Is it worth $400?As the reviewers below note, there are free alternatives like NeoOffice. I have used these, and while MS Office is very, very good, NeoOffice is nearly as good and free.If you're spending other people's money (i.e. you're in a business), MS Office is a must, of course. If you're spending your own money, try the free alternatives before committing."
3,Sci-Fi,"This is a small budget sci-fi film from the early 60's. Rarely seen, it's actually not too bad. I would say any sci-fi buff would probably want it since the price is low. Just bare in mind that it's a minor film, but worth a look."
2,Dull,"Having finished Creature From the Haunted Sea early, Corman decided to put the locations and talent he still had on hand to work on another film. Robert Towne wrote the script in a rush at the same time it was being filmed (and at the same time he was acting in it), so don't expect another ""Chinatown"". A mobster, his wife, and a lawyer are scubadiving when some disaster (maybe an atomic war) burns out the oxygen in the air. They are saved because they still have about an hours worth of air in their tanks and are near an oxygen producing jungle. At first they work together, but a love triangle forms. Some intelligence shines through, but ultimately the film is little more than talking heads and arguments. Nothing profound.As for the picture quality, the colour has mostly faded to shades of red."
3,"The only two men left alive plus the only available woman equals big trouble, or: 2M + 1W = TNT","Niche market DVD purveyor RCF's dubs are ""best available source,"" with quality that varies from only fair to very good..In Roger Corman's LAST WOMAN ON EARTH, while a husband and wife and their lawyer pal are skindiving, everyone on Puerto Rico perishes. It seems there may not be another human alive anywhere else either. Tension soon arises in this forced triangle that leads to tragedy.(Robert Towne, who plays the family friend, also wrote this one's script.)TRIVIA: After Corman and company finished work on the tongue-in-cheek monster film,CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA(1961), they quickly cranked out this disturbing little three-actor melodrama..Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(4.9) Last Woman on Earth (1960) - Betsy Jones-Moreland, Antony Carbone, Robert Towne"
3,Not Bad,This movie was produced in 1960 so we still had 60 years to go till the real armagedon. Now that there are only a few years left our end of the world movies are much more accurate.
4,Scrabble Game,"This is not the delux model we expected. The plastic rims (edges) that hold the letter tiles, are not as high as expected, so the tiles are not held in place as expected when you spin the board for each player. We purchase a delux scrabble game years ago that had plastic edges for each tile that held each tile in place much better."
4,Deluxe Scrabble,"The Deluxe Scrabble arrived at least a week to ten days prior to the promised delivery date. That was wonderful! I am somewhat disappointed in the durability of the product. The ridges are not sturdy enough to hold the tiles against slight bumps. The turntable moves easily, almost too easily and needs to be steadied as a person is making a play. The tiles, the racks, and the tile bag are very nice. They would rate a ""5."""
3,Not as nice as the old deluxe Scrabble board...very disappointing!,"I purchased this game expecting that it would be as good, if not nicer, that the board that my mother and my eldest sister own. I found that the game board itself is nothing like the older, better board. The grooves that are supposed to keep the letters in place are not as deep as on the old game and the letters are disturbed from their spot very easily. Also, the quality of the plastic the board is made of is not very durable or good quality like the old board. I would recommend to anyone looking to spend this much money on a Scrabble board game to try and find a good used one on ebay."
4,Scrabble Deluxe game,"Love the spinning feature, but the grid seems to be more of raised thin papery plastic rather than the hard, clear plastic grid on other Scrabble Deluxe games I've seen. This grid works, just doesn't hold the tiles in place quite as well as the clear grid. Maybe that grid was on older boards."
2,DELUXE EDITION SCRABBLE DISAPPOINTING,"I was disappointed in the Deluxe Edition set as the tiles do not stay secure inside the grooves and it isn't as well made as others on which I have played. In other words it doesn't look ""deluxe"". I have other Scrabble sets from many, many years ago, but I wanted this edition for the turntable and separated grooves."
1,A real disappointment from an old Scrabble fan,"My husband got this for my birthday. I have the old deluxe edition, but the turntable doesn't turn freely anymore, so I wanted a new one. I love playing scrabble and have been playing for more than 40 years! When I opened the box I couldn't believe the poor quality of this game. I can't imagine this holding up for more than a few games. The board is flimsy cardboard mounted on a cheap plastic grid, and the letter trays are the poorest quality plastic I've ever seen in a game! What happened to you MB to produce this horrible quality product and then sell for such an exorbitant price? You get what you pay for certainly does not apply to this item. Stick to the cheap model and you are more likely to get something usable. I hope I am able to return this item because I sure don't want it."
2,"Great game, but should be called ""Flimsy Edition""","Everyone knows Scrabble, so I'll review the quality of this product rather than the game itself.Everything about this is flimsy, the plastic base is pretty weak, not that this game is designed to take a beating. The cardboard board with its raised edges is also pretty poor.If you want a better quality version of this, look on ebay for an older version made from bakelite, it will probably cost the same anyway.For all it's faults, it is just Scrabble and as I said, not designed to take a beating. I won't be rushing out to buy a better quality one from ebay, but one day, I will definitely do so."
2,"Great Game, Poor Quality Board","Scrabble is my favorite game by far. It is a game that is different every time. It is challenging and highly entertaining.Unfortunately, Hasbro has decided to go cheap in the quality department. I have an older version of the deluxe game that is very high quality. The newer version is poorly made. It is flimsy and the tile slots are shallow.Anyone who ever played on one of the original flat boards knows what a huge improvement the recessed tile slots were in the original deluxe game. Now they are not nearly as deep so the tiles are not well secured and the board is about as stable as cardboard.One hopes that the manufacturers will go back to making high quality boards for this outstanding game."
1,Nothing Deluxe About it!,"Don't be fooled by the picture on the box.... it gives the illusion that the board and tile holders are made of wood. (which is why we figured it had the almost $40 price tag) We were soooo disappointed when we opened the box. The turntable is made of CHEAP plastic. The slots for the letters are too shallow, so you will still spend time adjusting letters.The stand does split in half, so you don't have to have the board 1 1/2 inches off of the table. The turntable works decently, but for the extra $20, the ""deluxe"" edition is just a Deluxe Rip-off."
3,Scrabble from Target,"The set arrived in a large carton with inadequate cushioning. Two of the four corners of the Scrabble box, both the top and one bottom corners were damaged. I did not request a replacement set as it was a Christmas present for my Mother at an Assisted Living facility.Needless to say, I was embarrassed to give a gift that had to be mended."
4,Great board game!,Scrabble is an old favorite that will be around forever. It's a great game to play for two or more players. You start off with seven randomly choosen letters and have to create words that connect to eachother all over the board all while racking up as many points as you can with each letter. it's a great thinking game... get's you digging through your mind's vocabulary bank and using your internal spell-checker. Educational and fun at the same time.
5,Great game!,"We have owned this game for over one year and have not had any problems with durability, and we play it constantly. Can't wait to try out our travel version."
2,scrabble board feels cheap,scrabble the game is great. the deluxe version for approximately [...] feels cheap. it has a very thin plastic and carboard board with plastic tile holders. i was expecting something that felt more solid.
4,Deluxe turntable Scrabble,"I was disappointed in that my granddaughter's version is unlike mine. The board is totally colorless unlike mine where there is a color code to each double or triple letter or word score.Also, I was led to believe that when I used my newly opened Amazon credit card I would receive a $30 refund, which I have not received . Please respond."
1,Great Game - HORRIBLE BOARD,"No doubt about it - scrabble is a great game - but they have a lot of nerve charging the price they do for this piece of junk. The ""deluxe"" board is cheaply made and DOES NOT hold the tiles in place. I have the older version of the deluxe game and it is a true winner - whoever dreamed up this version ought to be fired - but probably won't because my guess is it cost them pennies to make and they are charging far too much for the quality that just is not there.You may as well just by the standard edition - because this one doesn't hold the tiles in place either."
1,Plastic garbage,"We love Scrabble and thought it would be nice to have the fancy board where the tiles fit into the slots so they can't move and the built in lazy susan. Unfortunately, the latest version is a plastic piece of garbage. If you have played on the old version you will be shocked at just how cheap this is. We took it out of the box, were shocked, and within 2 minutes had it resealed for return. The profit margins on games are already obscene, this is yet another new low in corporate greed. And you wondering why the world is going to crap? Here it is!"
1,Poor Quality - get the Onyx Edition!,"I could not believe this ""deluxe"" version was so poorly made. I have a previous deluxe edition and this one doesn't even come close. The tile holders on the board are so shallow and made of flimsy plastic. The tiles constantly come out and mess up the board. The board itself is smaller, the turnstile isn't attached and the overall plastic on the board is cheaply made. I am so disappointed they charge $35 for this product and it is going back. I am getting the Onyx Edition from Barnes and Noble instead."
5,If You Love Scrabble As Many Do Try This Deluxe Edition,"Our family has switched over to the deluxe edition. It is the same game as the regular edition. However, the game equipment is nicer and easier to use. The board is more attractive and the board is configured to hold the played tiles in place as the board is moved. Also, the board spins around to the next player and will face each player as they take their turns. The game itself is one of the most popular board games of all time."
2,"Same good game, crappy modern manufacturing","[...]Milton Bradley and Hasbro are out to reduce the quality of their product, just to make a fast nickel. The modern set is too flimsy for durability. The board is a one piece molded grid that BARELY holds the tiles in place. No acrylic grid over a paper board. The design is screened onto the surface.If Winning Games decides to make a turntable edition of SUPER Scrabble, will they make the board just as cheap? Who knows? I hope not.I would buy another Deluxe Edition if it weren't for the junky quality in these modern sets."
1,Very disappointing quality,"One of the best games out there, but this version is far from Deluxe, and I agree with the other reviewers about disappointment with the VERY cheaply made board. I would suggest finding a ""classic"" deluxe edition on an auction site."
5,New Scrabble Game,"Nicer than the basic Scrabble, but we replaced the plastic tile holders from this game with the wooden ones from the basic Scrabble."
4,Swival Scrabble Game set - Gotta have!,"Negatives: frame is plastic, but not real problem.Positives: Superb design. Letter tiles and other accessories are good quality and a welcomed plus. The swivel base is excellent for players who are more comfortable viewing the word challenges ""head on"" rather than from a side view. This was a gift to my son's family; they love it. Now we may order one for our own use. Great mental exercise: Mind expanding game for all ages!"
2,"Stop producing ""deluxe"" junk!","I was hoping for a durable, deluxe version that my kids could keep. Until recently, I had an older ""deluxe"" version, that was fine, but this version is real junk! The board is made of thin plastic (but made to look thick), the tile racks out of thin plastic (they used to be wood) and the tabletop out of cardboard with a plastic coating. Even the wood tiles seem to be made in a shoddy way. What is the point of calling this version deluxe? Even the regular version is better!"
1,MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT,"My Ma always enjoied scrabble and she wanted the deluxe edition so i got it for her on Xmas, to everyones disappointment, the game is all plastic or psuedo wood, the only real wood was the letters, the turntable thingy is complicated. I would reccomened scrabble. But NOT THIS VERSION"
4,Loved this game!,"My husband and I had never played Scrabble before. We decided to give it a go, and we were really impressed with the set up of this game. The game seems to be pretty sturdy, and we loved the turntable. All in all I would reccomend this Edition to my friends and family."
5,FAVORITE GAME IN OUR FAMILY,"All my family and friends enjoy playing Scrabble. It is everyone's favorite board game. Have played for years, since the first Scrabble game was marketed. Improvements have been made to the boards ... tiles stay in place and each game is attractive. My favorite board of all is the very first improved board with the red plastic scoring racks with the silver pegs for scoring. I have many Scrabble games, but this is our favorite. We have a game handy wherever we go."
1,Poorly Made,"The turntable top is poorly made compared to the orginal deluxe turntable top. Looks cheap and feels cheap, definitely NOT worth the money."
1,Not worth it,"I was not impressed with this product. It is cheap in every way. The turntable and tile holders are cheap plastic. The tiles barely stay in the grid on the board. The pictures on the box and description make it out to be a nice game set, but it is quite the opposite. I'm keeping my original Scrabble set and giving this model away."
1,Not worth the $,"For everyone trying to replace the hard plastic spinning model from 20 years ago... Stay away from this! It is cheap and cheesy. The board is made of molded cardboard with a plastic film on top. It's not even well connected to the frame, which is a cheap replica of the orignial. I got this as a gift for my mother and waas truly shocked at the poor quality. Buyer Beware!!!!"
2,Scrabble,"When I ordered this game, I saw that the box was advertised as Deluxe turntable Scrabble. When my grandchildren came to visit, I told them to set the game up while I finished what I was doing. I was so disappointed when I saw that it was not like my daughters Deluxe Scrabble game. The game board is flimsy. The board had a covering on it without the plastic covering like the one she has. The good board has a plastic covering over the board so the letter pieces are held place in much better. With this board, everytime you put a letter down,you have to be careful not to knock other pieces off. I called and was told I could return it which I did."
3,"The adjumct parts are definitely not ""deluxe""!","Within 6 months of purchase, the letter distribution strips have become unreadable. The wood tiles are of poor quality, very rough, and the paint on the letters is almost gone on many of the tiles. We have therefore retrieved the tiles from our older ""non-deluxe"" edition in order to be able to play with readable tiles which feel smooth to the touch. This is extremely disappointing since we paid top dollar for the ""best"" that Parker Bros. offers in this game. We play in tournaments and are members of the National Scrabble Association, so we expected much better quality."
2,"Good turntable, very chintzy board","It's embarassing that the flagship Scrabble product in the US has been cheapened so much.Pros:* turntable feels better than ever* tiles & racks are decentCons:* board is paper-textured grid prone to getting dirty (permanently)* printing on board is dull and difficult to read in lower light conditions* tiles do not stay put* board surface feels flimsy and cheapI've owned a Selchow & Righter deluxe board for over 25 years, and it is nearly in mint condition after more than 1000 games played. With it's brightly printed and easy to read special squares sealed beneath the hard plastic grid which firmly anchors the tiles in place, it simply puts the latest cheap product from MB to shame (which I've used at my local Scrabble club).If at all possible, pick up an old turntable edition at a garage sale -- you'll be happier, it will last far longer, and it will cost less. And if you play frequently, buy a set of Protiles (or some similar after market tile set)."
2,way overpriced,This version is being phased out for the new diamond edition. Hence the outrageous pricing online.Cons:The board is made of flimsy feeling plasticBox is huge. Very hard to store if you are tight on space.Pros:Tiles are woodlooks niceAll in all it's scrabble a fun educational game but you could get that with any version without spending over a hundred dollars. If you feel you must get this take a serious look at the onyx version for fifty bucks. <-- if you wait for the right borders or bn coupon you can knock it down another twenty five percent.
2,Terribly overpriced,"I have been shopping around for the deluxe version of Scrabble for some weeks now (finally purchased but decided to see if I paid too much by checking amazon.com). For some reason, amazon.com is overcharging for this item--about $25 overpriced to be specific. You can find this same version at Barnes & Noble for $35 and at Toy R Us for $33 (as of 12/2007). An additional caveat: all the people who post complaints at the various sites about the shoddiness of this version, when compared to the older deluxe version, are unfortunately quite correct in complaining--very poor materials. It *feels* cheap. The original Scrabble base edition I remember so fondly from my distant childhood was of higher quality than this disappointing modern edition. My advice would be to buy the basic version (from a store that doesn't overcharge so outrageously) and place it on a large lazy susan situated on your game table."
3,"Cheaply made ""Deuxe"" Board","My friend has an older deluxe board that lives up to it's description. This one, does not. The grids are not high enough to hold the tiles so they continue to shift around. Also, unless you've committed the square values to memory, you have to keep lifting the tiles to add up your word points.I love the game of scrabble, but found this version, for the price, to be somewhat disappointing. I guess if you never played on the original ""deluxe"" board, you won't have a problem with it."
2,The,"As a big fan of Scrabble, I anxiously purchased the Deluxe edition for Christmas for my 10 and 13 year old, remembering the days of playing the old Deluxe version with my Mom. My anticipation and excitement was quickly replaced by surprise and disapointment at the cheap and flimsy board that I found in the box. What happened?!?!?!?!? (...)I don't feel they put $10 worth of work into this thing. While still nicer that the standard version, it defintely comes short of the old version with the plastic board that keeps peices in place; this one is a cheap imitation with a thin cardboard playing board with tiny ridges that is not even attached to the playing surface - there are actually waves in the board!! Very disappointing effort all around."
1,Big Disappointment,"This ""deluxe"" scrabble board was a huge disappointment for me. I used to have the previous Scrabble Deluxe board, which I purchased in the early 90's, with the hard plastic board and raised edges for the tiles to fit in and I loved it. The pieces were all very sturdy and I was so pleased with it. I purchased this board as a replacement for my old deluxe board which I gave to my mom. This board is made of extremely flimsy plastic and the raised tiles are a joke. The tiles pop out of them very easily. The surface of the board is made a crappy coated cardboard I think. I would suggest finding the older version of the deluxe board on ebay."
4,Breath of fresh air,"After playing Scrabble for years on a traditional board, this new and way more expensive board, is a breath of fresh air. Although gawmy (mid-coast Maine version of the word) storage-wise, it's nice to be able to pick up the game when dinner is called and be able to resume afterwards. It spins nicely and the tiles don't move, but if I was ruler of the Scrabble world, I'd build the whole thing out of wood (I miss those wooden tile holders) and have it quality heavy. In these days though, plastic is what you are going to get and it will long outlive us."
3,Color Changes All!!!!!!!!!!,Ultimate Game!! i am a definite scrabble fan yet im still weirded out by the fact that they changed the wooden tile color to burgundy/red.. makes it look ugly!
4,scrabble,The tiles do not stay in tightly in the grooves. There are better Scrabble games where the tiles don't slip so easily.
1,Parker Bros should be embarassed for this poor quality product.,"I totally agree with every poor review on this game. I did not check the reviews before ordering as I NEVER THOUGHT Parker would go the so very cheap route.Tried to send them an e-mail. It would not go through. Have a feeling they know what we are going to say.1 Star is too much for this product!Poor quality (tiles do not stay in place, STICKERS for letter value, plastic is ready to crack right out of te box)Poor customer service (site says you can send e-mail but mail does not go through)."
2,disappointing,"I just purchased this after years of playing on the old baord and also using the old version of turntable game. This new deluxe edition turntable is very disappointing!! It is very cheaply made and I can imagine it falling apart before the years end, the game board is not all one piece but the edges can be lifted up and pulled away from the board. the racks are plastic I see these as eaily get stepped on and crushed. This is a very poor quality game and would not waste my money on it again! I plan to try and return it if the store will take it back."
2,Not your parent's scrabble!,"If you are buying this because your parents/grandparents/etc. have the deluxe edition and you want one too, be warned, this is nowhere close to as ""deluxe"" as their version. The board is flimsy, the racks are plastic, the turntable is fragile, it's barely better than the standard game board. Look elsewhere for a slightly used version from the 90s. You'll be glad you did."
1,"BRING BACK ORIGINAL ""LOCK IN PLACE"" BOARD!!!","Is anyone satisfied with the ""raised ridges"" which are supposed to keep the tiles from slipping but do not? Especially if you once owned the ""lock in place"" board, but lost it due to natural disaster, the only circumstance which would allow my Scrabble pieces to slip my grasp?I love Scrabble, but I hate this product.BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL ""LOCK IN PLACE"" PLASTIC BASE! It was great! Did it cost an extra nickel to produce in Indochina or something? I'll pay that extra nickel. Did people complain the board was harder to clean up after the game because you have to dump all the tiles or pick them out individually? What idiot okayed this change? NOT A SCRABBLE PLAYER AND CERTAINLY NOT A FAN OF THE FANS!"
1,"New ""Deluxe"" Scrabble is a bait and switch","The new ""Deluxe"" Scrabble makes you think that it will be as good as the one you used to play on, but leaves you with a piece of cardboard in a thin plastic frame. I bought it for my husband for Christmas (it was the only thing he wanted), and was utterly disappointed when he opened the box. If Hasbro wants to manufacture a cheaper version, then they should advertise it as such. But some of us would like to have a board that you can't poke your finger through."
3,A great game diminished by cheap construction,"Our family enjoys playing scrabble so much so that we decided to buy the 'Deluxe' version to solve some of the common problems we have playing the game on a regular board.Needless to say I was thoroughly disappointed at the cheap, flimsy, plastic board I received in the box. I have seen other 'Deluxe' brands which my friends and relatives had bought years ago and was shocked at what is now being sold, at over double the price of the regular version. The old one I had looks as if it will outlast the 'Deluxe'.I reduced the fun rating by 2 stars simply because I hate looking at this board. Save your money and don't buy this one."
1,caveat emptor! waste of money,"I bought this deluxe scrabble board, thinking that it would hold my tiles in my place. I was WRONG. As other reviews have already mentioned, this 'raised' grid is made out of flimsy plastic, and is hardly raised at all, so if you bump the grid a bit, the tiles still scatter. This was a total waste of money, and I should have gone and tried to find one of the older hard-plastic version. Beware!"
5,****SIMPLY SPECTACULAR****,What fun! This is the best Scrabble game! The turntable is great! I like the new color of the letters! Lots of variation games listed. Get a dictionary to go with it though!
5,Scrabble Deluxe Doesn't Disappoint,I don't know what everyone is talking about. This game is fantastic. My husband and I are Scrabble enthusiasts. We play at least once a week but often three or four times. We love the Deluxe version because of the grid and swivel board. It still looks as good as new. I highly recommend this game.
4,"Less Drizzt, More fun","Starring two of Salvatore's best villains, Artemis and Jarlaxle, this book is full of fun.To the dismay of his followers, Jarlaxle's band of drow, Bregan D'Aerthe, have secretly began moving out of the Underdark and into the city of Calimport. Some believe he is being manipulated by the powerful Crystal Shard, Crenshenibon, but no one knows for sure. Even Jarlaxle's close friend, the assassin Artemis Entreri, can't tell.However, Artemis has plans of his own. He has set his eyes on Charon's Claw, the powerful weapon held by Kohrin Soulez.All hell breaks lose when Jarlaxle's band turns against him. Jarlaxle and Artemis must team up to fight the likes of Rai-guy, Kimmuriel, and Berg'inyon - and ultimately to destroy the crystal shard itself.This is one of Salvatore's funnest Forgotten Realms novels to date and perhaps his best since Homeland."
4,A surprisingly fun read.,"I was a bit shy picking this book up at first. Mainly because I didn't know if I really wanted to read a book that didn't follow Drizzt or any of his companions. Well, I'm glad I did pick it up. It was a change of pace.Not only do we follow two of Drizzt's biggest enimies, but we get deep inside of them, learning about their thoughts and feelings. Throughout all of the Drizzt books, we look at these characters as cold blooded, evil killers with no hearts at all. Now we find out that they are still exactly what we thought they were, but we also find out that these characters have a little good in them as well.This book, as well as the previous ""Spine of the World"" was a big leap for Salvatore. A lot of loyal fans were not very happy that he left Drizzt out of these books. But hear this. Don't be upset. This is still Salvatore's classic writing, and we still follow friends and foes of Drizzt alike. Don't skip this book. You will surly regret it."
5,Likeable Villains?,"I have read many Forgotten Realms books, but this was by far the most entertaining of them all. Artemis Entreri is the most complex yet interesting character ever created. When I purchased Servant of the Shard, I sat down and finished the book in about 4-5 hours. It was mesmerizing. The rest of the world was completely shut off from me while I immeresed myself in this work of art. I just hope Mr. Salvatore continues to produce more stories that include Jarlaxle and Entreri as well as the multitudes of Dark Elves. Drizzt and his gang are fun but pale in comparison to the deliciously entangled mess that the Assasin and Dark Elf find themselves repeatedly in.I reccomend this book to anyone that prefers great entertainment to the crap displayed at the movies! Its a wonderful read and I only hope for more from Mr. Salvatore."
4,Not as good as the Drizzt novels,"A good book, but I was disappointed there wasn't much about Drizzt."
4,Intrigue! Backstabbing! Entreri!,"Following up Salvatore's ""The Spine of the World"", it's no suprise that he's decided to write another novel focusing on a character other than Drizzt. What's different, this time around, is that the character chosen is none other than Drizzt's archnemesis, Artemis Entreri, now battling for control over the Crystal Shard (and his life) and matching wits with Jarlaxle, the enigmatic drow mercenary.As always, Salvatore spins an enjoyable tale, and he continues the more intriguing plotlines that are the hallmark of ""mature Salvatore""- his writings from Legacy of the Drow on. No longer content just to regurgitate the same stories of his predecessors, Salvatore engages the reader with a far more intelligent story. He rises above the pack of ""shared world"" fiction with refreshing style- one can tell that Salvatore enjoys writing his novels as much as his readers enjoy reading them.All in all, another fine book. Hopefully Drizzt is in the next one!"
3,Well....,"I have never given a book less than four stars on a rating, especially not a Salvatore book. But this one I just could not get into. I didn't even finish it because it seemed to me like the plot was rambling on and on, over and over.Maybe it's because I am not a fan of the Jarlaxle/Entreri duo. I had borrowed this book from a friend in hopes that it would be a Drizzt book, but my favorite dark elf hardly made an appearance. Also, I did not read the prior 2 books in this series, and that confused me a little. I had read several other books about the Crystal Shard and the whole plot idea never did quite appeal to me-I guess this book put the icing on the cake.I would suggest this book only if you have read the first two books in this series, and happen to have a certain fondness for Jarlaxle and Artemis Entreri..."
3,Servent of the Shard,This novel was Salvatore at his best. It was guiniuss! I truly enjoyed reading about all the villans for a change. The only thing I didn't understand was how Entrie had infrazion in The Legacy of the Drow and in this book he needed his sword to see in the darkness. Anyway it was an amazing novel!
1,did not do it for me,I am still looking for an indepth analysis-in English- of this fascinating but evil man. There is so much to be explained yet I can't find one decent book on the subject.
2,Very disappointed,"I am very disappointed w/this product. It is advertised to pickup pet hair with the dyson vacuum, but does not work. When pressed onto the furniture the roller quits working. It probably works w/the handheld vac, but I can't afford that at this time. A VERY disappointing purchase"
2,Item pictured is not the item shipped,I returned the item because the Turbine Tool that was shipped to me is not the same item as pictured. The item i received is so cheaply made and is definitely not worth 65.00.
1,"Garbage, Absolute Garbage","I'd think if I were Dyson, I would recall all of these.Big, Bulky Pricey, and worthless. I thought turbines were designed to spin?It certainly does not compare to the vacuum at all.Bought a real one for $17 (shiping included) Eureka Power Paw, Dyson should be ashamed."
5,Worked fantastically on my carpeted staircases!,"This came with my Dyson Animal DC15, but I would have bought it separately if it hadn't. The powered hand tool worked better on my carpeted staircases than I could ever have imagined, which is saying something when my cats love to lay and play on those steps!"
2,Depends,"My mini turbine tool part stopped working. I contacted Dyson, hoping to purchase another part without realizing my vacuum was still under their 5 year warranty. However, when I spoke with several of members of their team, NO ONE could confirm I ever registered my product with them, even though I was sitting in front of my computer, signed into THEIR web site and looking at my registered products with their company. Unbelievable. And worse, I wasn't even looking to utilize my warranty but purchase a replacement part. Dyson is an expensive product with a non-existant warranty that I can not recommend. In the end, I ended up fixing my own, broken part myself without purchasing a replacement."
