1,doesn't work,Arrived timely however when I went to use in my dvd player did not play at all. Waste of money.
1,"disappointment, *shaking head*","If they had the 10th anniversary dvd/blu-ray available, this 25th anniversary wouldn't sell at all! The 10th anniversary concert literally had a dream cast. Unfortunately, this one didn't. Lea Salonga was soooo perfect as Eponie 15 years ago. Her replacement in the 25th just couldn't hold up to part. And while I was surprised Nick Jonas had some bit of a voice talent, he just wasn't a trained operatic singer. It was disappointing that he was casted as Marius. Really? Come-on! All in all, I'd much rather listen to my CDs from the 10th than watching this 25th cuz the latter just isn't worth watching :("
3,Concert,"Great song performance. However, I was hoping that this would have been more of the dramatized story mixed with the singing. I didn't realize it was simply a concert performed on stage in front of microphone stands. It made it difficult for my young children to understand the story line. I ended up narrating the story for them."
3,Marius Role was Terrible !,"As an avid Les Mis fan I was stunned when I saw that they cast Nick Jonas (Yes, a Jonas Brother)in the part of Marius, I feel bad for him, he seemed to try so hard but his voice was lost amongst all those trained Broadway voices. If you ever watch the 10th anniversary Les Mis and hear Michael Ball as Marius you will know what I mean. What a shame because the rest of the cast was awesome."
2,Les Miserable,Was not as good as the 10th Anniversary concert. Did not like the performers. Was not worth watching more than 10 minutes.
5,New voices to an all-time favorite!,"OK; it's not the Tenth Anniversary ""Dream"" cast, but if you like the musical it's well worth purchasing. There were some performances I liked better in each one, but these failed to detract from my enjoyment of either whole production.I believe the criticism of Marius is far too extreme, and certainly not something which detracts from my enjoyment of this performance. However least I be too forgiving, I must say that none of the 25th performers are up to Phillip Quast or Ruthie Henshall (this comment made me go to You-Tube and listen to Ruthie sing ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" and Phillip sing ""Stars before finishing this review). That is not to say The 25th singers were in the least wanting. I thought the young Cosette was better in the 25th, and the Inn-Keeper better in the 10th.All -in- all a great disk to add to any library.;"
5,Les Miserables 25th Anniversary Concert,"AMAZING!!! If you love Les Mis, if you like Broadway Musicals, this DVD/CD collection is a ""must,"" for your collection! It will have you in tears, and make you forever grateful for the power of a good Musical!"
3,Tolerable,"I prefer the 10th Anniv. edition (with Michael Ball as Marius, Ruthie Henshall as Fantine, and Lea Salonga as Eponine), but this edition was tolerable and most people will be happy with this one. Nick Jonas performed as Marius well enough, but he was clearly out of his element and not up to the vocal quality of the rest of the cast; but he could easily serve as the celebrity professional guest star as Marius in a high school or community college production where he would shine."
4,Le Mis,Great singing but I enjoyed the end of the original DVD better. I was hoping the former stars would appear at the end like they did in the original version.
5,Best show,I love this concert. I have fallen in love with Les Mis and this show is amazing. I loved how at the end the original cast came out.
5,Les Miserables,Finest production of Les Mis. Singing is outstanding and the bonus at the end is worth the purchase of the DVD.
5,I love it,Great performance. Highly recommended. It is one of the best music video that I ever have. It is worthwhile to be kept in the collection list.
4,really good read,"I enjoyed this book tremendously. The first page had me hooked and I read through the rest of the book with eagerness, wanting to know the outcomes. The main character loses her son in a car accident and sets out on a quest to determine what happened when she experiences some supernatural events. The events become more frequent and sinister leading her to a frightening conclusion. There were a few minor loose ends at the end of the book, which is why I only gave it a 4. I have read other books by Peter James and have become a fan of his."
2,So-so,"I got this from my public library and it looked so good on the surface. I read the whole thing but I am not at all sure who did what, when and why. What happened to David? Otto? Carrie? Phillip? And Alex????? It was a supernatural, ghost story, I think, but there were really no good answers on the last page. HEllo, Mother!!! I wish the reader from Australia would email me about this and other interesting books we like."
3,"Beautiful Idea, BUT Disappointing...","The premise of this love story is based on a mystical spell cast by a leprechaun, transforming Lady Moonlight into a white horse and binding her to marry the little man, unless she can find true love before the end of a hundred years. While I find the story's concept enticing, the Romance in the book failed to satisfy my imagination. Lady Moonlight does indeed meet her lover, however, the bulk of the book is spent detailing the heroine's trysts through fairyland with her annoying aunt and fairy friends. The lovers share FEW moments together and their dialogue is nothing more than small talk. They never discover more than each other's superficial beauty before the hundred years is nearly up. It is the book's end, however, that disappoints the most...The culmination was little more than a slapstick horserace of the hero with the silly leprechaun, and the hero's demands for the spell's undoing. COMEDIC and SILLY."
3,A better fantasy than it is a romance,"Unlike so many authors of paranormal romance, Kate Freiman understands the world of faerie. She doesn't paint a picture of a pretty, bright world. Her faeries are shallow, selfish, flighty -- just like the faeries of legend.I also liked the way Kate Freiman handled the timelines in her story. This book could've been confusing, as it takes place during three different times (and in the eternal present of the faerie realm), but it wasn't.If only I had liked the way she handled the romance as much. Unfortunately, the hero and heroine spend so much of the time apart.I gave this book a C+ at All About Romance."
1,Potty Mouthed Party Poopers,"This is disgusting and sexist. Suggesting that boys lack intelligence and are cranked out of the ""Stupid Factory"" and should be targets for feces flinging is sickening and cruel. Just think of the hue and cry and uproar if a book like this targeted GIRLS. Boys deserve the same recourse, rights and protection as do ALL people. While there are some who will find the fecal humor and nasty anti-boy comments funny, I think it is sick, sickening and just plain degrading."
1,Don't waste your money.,I just haven't had time to send it back. It is poor quality not at all what I thought it would be. It looked like something I could go to the fabric store and buy the Make an Ark kit. My 6 year old granddaughter could have put this thing together as good if not better then this product was.
4,great book by a rarely read poet,"I would just like to say that if you like good poetry, that is animalistic, beautiful, enrapturing, and enlightened then this is a great collection for you. Also if you are into beat lit. or other related subjects i believe Kandel is a important chapter and a must read."
4,Kandel is a must read for female poets,"Lenore Kandel is a female poet who was brought up on obscenity charges for her ""Love Book."" In ""Word Alchemy"" Kandel challenges us to express our deepest desires and truths with living language. She is a poet who truly speaks her soul onto the page in her own individual way. Her work challenges the reader to be truer to themself and their own path in life."
4,Bang For Your Buck!!!,"This ipod accessory is probably the best one I've bought so far, especially considering that it only cost about $10. It was really simple to use, just ""plug and play."" The most complicated thing you have to do, is switch the iPod TV feature to ""ON"" how simple is that!!! If you want to view your videos from your iPod on your TV screen accept no substitute. I used these while I was deployed to South West Asia and they worked like a charm."
2,Better Safe than Sorry,"I will preface by saying that I am not the most technologically savvy guy. I like to keep things quick and simple, and this particular AV-Adapter is not the best. In fact - I can't get the cable to work at all. My LCD flatscreen has several inputs, and I've tried every single one. I went to my Itouch video settings and made sure the settings were correct. Nothing. As my title suggests, it's better to be safe than sorry. Pay the extra few bucks and buy a cable that connects directly to the ipod connector (and not the headphone jack). I don't know how the other reviewers were able to use this cable and plug into their TVs, but I had no such luck. I paid $4 (including shipping), so I didn't lose a lot."
5,Typical Lori Foster - a great book!,Lori Foster has given us yet another great book about the much-loved residents of Visitation! This is a very enjoyable book with characters who are easy to care about and secondary characters whose stories have already been told as well as those with tales yet to be told. This book is deserving of 5+ stars.
4,"Kidnapping, murder and mystery",This novel tell the story of Clint and Julie. Clint is hired to find Julie after she is kidnapped. In the process of solving the puzzle they find they are perfect match. Lori Foster brings in all the old characters from Visitation. I am off to find more of the Visitation series which I am reading out of order....
3,Debated about 3 or 4 stars,This isn't my favorite Lori Foster book. It took me a while to figure out that this was the same Julie Rose that was in Say No to Joe? which is never a good sign. I thought Clint's weak stomach was an interesting dimension. As a stand alone book this would be a weak 4 but as part of the series it's a solid 3 stars.
1,What Century Is This?,"So I don't know if this concept is floated much in these types of reviews, but in general, I think it is safe to say one-sided sex sucks. There - I said it.I had the misfortune of reading two of White's books (bought them together - never again). Winds and Skin Deep. I was disappointed in both for exactly the same reasons:1.Absolutely no point/catharsis for the reader/protaganists.2.One-sided sex, i.e. let me get you off and don't you worry your pretty little head about me.This author writes absolute rubbish, and subscribes to some archaic concept of top vs. bottom that I associate with the outdated notion of role playing and gender stereotypes. And to be perfectly frank, it wasn't even particularly well written one-sided sex."
3,Shared Winds.,"This is an acceptable book to spend reading for a couple of hours. I did not feel the characters were developed fully and the storyline was mediocre. The intimate interactions were not that convincing to me with the lovemaking seeming to be one sided. I noticed no glaring spelling or grammar mistakes. I believe this is the authors debut novel, and as such, it is passable. I do look forward to reading her later novels."
1,Unsatisfying,"I am a fanatic reader and enjoy books by Pat Conroy (Prince of tides), Isabelle Allende and Dan Brown.I found this book extremely superficial, without any depth and even though the concept and story sounded like a good idea it really left me completely cold. The style of writing is immature and predictable, and from the first page I knew exactly what's gonna happen. I know it is a first novel, and I truly hope the next one will be much better. I will not take the chance however. The other reviews made me think it could only be family and friends who can be so gentle. I will only recommend this to people who are into commercial bubblegum stories and not serious readers."
2,not like the pic,"this item is not at all like what is shown in the picture at all. my mom still put it down on the floor, but now she is removing it and putting down purgo."
2,Replaced a singer with a belter,"Eurythmics-era Annie Lennox singing a bunch of James Bond movie themes. If that sounds good, buy it. If not, skip it."
3,"No Skye, No Morcheeba...","I am a big morcheeba fan, and its not that this album isnt good, but its not great. I agree with the other reviewer that the new singer sounds like she should be singing the opening of a bond film, not morcheeba. I am open to change, but the new singer doesnt quite capture the spirit nor have the impact that Skye did. If you are expecting the same sound of old in morcheeba with this album, you will be disappointed. dont get me wrong, its not bad, its kinda catchy, but just a little disappointing for morcheeba."
2,Not the Morchiba I love,"It's my fault for loading up the card with CDs and not looking at the reviews first, but I had no idea that this record sports a new vocalist as well as a new style. Morchiba's prior stuff has a prominent place in many of my playlists -- so trippy, so beautiful. At virtually every dinner party, someone asks ""who is this?"" when a Morchiba tune comes around.But I am sorry to say that I doubt any tracks from this album will end up on my future playlists. I agree with another reviewer - several tunes sound like they could be out of a James Bond movie soundtrack. Don't get me wrong - it's not bad, it is just not the treasured sound of the greatest trip hop band of all time.Sad, really."
2,The voice is gone,"The voice is gone, the voice is gone....a sad day, Skye Edwards no longer haunts the ethereal realm of trip hop and its a damn shame. The voice is gone and although Daisey's voice is good its not Skye Edwards'. I fell in love with Morcheeba because of a voice, Skye's voice; nothing else like it on earth. To me Skye and Morcheeba are one in the same. Remove her and you should change the name, its simply not the same. I miss that voice, that voice, that sensual voice, that hypnotic voice...what happened?If you don't own it already, buy ""Who Can You Trust"" and start your collection there and see what I'm talking about, then you can end your collection just before this one. This is not Morcheeba...its not the voice. Its decent but falsely advertised as Morcheeba....sort of like Sammy Haggar sitting in for David Lee Roth...its good but not the same...Skye Edwards please visit us again...please"
4,Surprisingly different,"I have always been a BIG fan of Morcheeba, ever since I heard the under-rated ""Shoulder holster"".The Antidote IS different; not just because SKYE is missing (& I just have to admit it that - I MISS her), but also because this is so much more of a ""Chunkier"" sound than the eponymous chill of ""Big Calm"", This is a Different band with a different story to tell, its almost as if they want to take themselves more seriously (than they should).Must hear tracks are - Wonders never cease; everybody loves a Loser & Ten men ...And what of Daisy ? You have to give it to the girl, she would have been expected to live upto Skye's formidable style; but she goes and does a ""military coup"" ..."
2,The day trip-hop died...,"People ordering this should know that Skye, the singer of the past Morcheeba albums, is not on this record. The two men who started the band got a new singer, who just isn't as special, and now the band sounds like a lot of other bands (unfortunately). With Skye gone they just don't stand out from the rest. :-("
4,It's all good...,"I'm among those who reacted with shock upon learning that Skye Edwards had been replaced in Morcheeba. But after reading that she is readying a solo album (I'll be first in line to buy it), I decided to calm down and give a listen to The Antidote. Wow. Daisy Martey's voice, and her delivery, fit perfectly with the newly energized drive of the songs on this album. But no sooner was I won over by the ""new"" Morcheeba than I discovered that Daisy, too, has now left the band. Sad -- but then, this move creates an opening for another totally new sound on the next Morcheeba album. And, if Daisy Martey does a solo project of her own, plenty of The Antidote's fans will be in line to buy it. Call me Pollyanna....."
5,This is still amazing,"First off, if any of you are TRUE Morcheeba fans you would KNOW that there is a new singer on this 5th Album. Yes, the singer has changed, but the band hasn't. It still has that great sound & the singer has a catchy sultry voice.And for all Skye fans - her debut solo album is coming out in 2006!"
2,I was disappointed,"I bought this album after falling in love withCharangoand I was quite disappointed. Skye Edwards departure made for a different sound that I personally didn't enjoy as much.I respect the opinion of those who do like this album, but my personal experience is that I like Charango andBig Calm, but not this. I think I ended up giving it away to a friend."
3,Good album but it's not a Morcheeba,"This album is so different, but good actually. It has been hard for me to get used to that big change. The new singer has a strong personality, a certain presence. Even musically, it's more dynamic than it used to. I personally regret that the sensuality of Skye is gone, her voice made the soul of the band. but Daisy has incredibly mutated the band, and she has given a new breath, but I think it would have been more honest to change the name of the band. It's a good album, but it's not a Morcheeba."
2,This is the last one i purchase of Morcheeba...,"This is the last one i purchase of Morcheeba, without listening to it first. Agreeing with some of previous reviewers, the sound is not BIG CALM, nor is it WHO CAN YOU TRUST?. It's different. I purchased the CD, without listening to it first. This was after hearing the other two mentioned above. I was surprised, not in a good way and disappointed that the heart and soul sound of Skye was missing. I gave the CD away. Some may like the new singer. I'll pass."
2,Morcheeba = Boring now,"I'm listening to Everyone Loves a Loser as I write this, and I'm actually bored. It sounds like a pop song, FCOL. I got hooked on Big Calm after only ONE song that was included on a mix CD I got for free after attending a Stevie Nicks concert.This album just isn't as interesting as Big Calm was. I'm going to see what Skye has been up to... hopefully she has a solo album out.FCOL = ""for crying out loud""."
1,Sad Day For Morcheeba,I was sad when I heard that Skye Edwards was leaving but the pure vocal talent of the new lead singer more than makes up for it. What can't redeem this album is the song writing straight out of a junior high school band. It is truely sad that the vocals cannot carry the tired and cliched songwriting. This album (which I bought for $9.99 on iTunes) was a waste of money and has made me move on from Morcheeba with much regret.
3,has its moments,"Morcheeba didn't just ""lose Skye"", as some think. The Godfrey Brothers asked Skye to leave because her style didn't fit with the new musical directions in which they wanted to go, e.g., this recording. Daisy Martey, the singer on this CD, was fired by the Godfrey Brothers and she responded by suing them for assault, defamation, harassment and breach of contract.This recording marks a very different direction for Morcheeba. Though it pales in comparison with Who Can You Trust? and Big Calm, there are many fine moments, especially tracks 1,2 and 5."
2,TWO STAR RESTAURANT,"Morcheeba, for some reason or another has unfortunately changed there menu from a delicious variety of spicy treats to cotton candy and soda ""pop"". While I'm sure this new saccharine approach will find them new customers, long time patrons like me will be looking for somewhere else to dine. The album is musically proficient, but lacks anything resembling the Morcheeba fans know and love. Oh well, all good things must come to pass. Good luck in your new venture."
1,Not sure.....,".....whether this CD s*cks or blows. I have all of this band's other CDs, which demonstrate a good spectrum of style, but this new CD just isn't what I like. I know the Godfrey brothers ""are"" the band, but without Skye's vocals, they are just another band, and not one that I particularly care for.AND.....their website says that now their new lead singer, Daisy, has been replaced by someone else. Better get it together guys, but in any event, I won't be buying any more Morcheeba CDs."
2,Rather Lame,"I bought this album in France for the airplane ride home. Let's just say that it didn't occupy me the whole time. This is unfortunate, because after hits like Big Calm, I was expecting a lot. I suppose it has been too long since I listened to Morcheeba; their sound has totally changed, and, unfortunately, not in a good way. The lead singer's voice is really wonderful, but the writing is poor overall. The only redeaming song on the album is ""Everybody Loves a Loser"" which at least has some oompf. The other songs are utterly forgetable. I am sad to say that I was unhappy with this purchase."
4,solid,"What a great sound. I own several cheeba disks and find their sound refreshing and sophisticated. Where Skye is melodious and silky smooth, Daisy is direct and powerful. I feel if both were able to complement the band such as Zero 7 does with Sia, Sophie and Tina we could indeed be in for a very special sonic treat. In the end I respect both singers and their amazing vocals, and one needs to recognize the band for their desire to evolve and expand themselves artisticly. They will benefit from it."
3,Very Cute but quit working quickly,"I love the look of this lamp!! It goes with my nursery perfectly and for the first couple of days it worked perfectly too. However, around day 3, it quit working. We checked the light bulb to make sure that wasn't the problem but even with a new light bulb and plugged into a new outlet, the lamp didn't work. So, we're stuck with a very cute but non-functioning lamp."
4,Very Beautiful but...,"I put this lamp and shade on my registry and my husband bought it for me for Easter. It was much more adorable in person. It's the perfect height and colors, not too bright not too mild. The only complaint that I have is that the shade shakes if its touched, like it doesn't latch onto the stand it just waddles on it under the bulb even when the bulb is in there isn't any way to tighten the shade securly onto the base. But who really touches the shade that often to have it shake?"
2,"ok lumbar, not good for fit","Bought this for passenger seat of 2003 Ram 1500. We like the lumbar support it provides, but hate it otherwise. It never stays put. Am constantly having to adjust to get in the seat and then once seated, having to adjust the cover back into place."
2,Ram Seat Cushion Rating,I found the Ram seat cushion to work very well for intended use to help protect driver seat from extensive ware. It also works very well as a lent brush that is very hard to clean. the bottom seat section should be made from the easier to clean vinyl material. The upper portion with the Ram logo can remain as cloth material. I really do not want to have to take this debris partical magnet in once a week to vacuum and clean.
4,I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS GOOD!!!,"The premise of this movie sounds absolutely ridiculous on paper. So much so, that I don't want to spell it out for fear of scaring off potential viewers. I'll just say that it's a lot more nerve-racking than a movie that revolves around cows should be. The stylish camera work and believable acting help you reach the point you need to be at to dispend belief enough to let the plot unravel. However, the true genius comes in the slow build towards unease and sudden shocks that the average movie would ruin with a heavy orcestral score punctuating the parts where you're supposed to jump. This is clean and direct, which works wonders. Clever, yet simple, this would be a rare horror gem, if it didn't fall into the tired chase/hide/scream formula in the third act. Any true fans of horror should give this one a shot ,If u like ""THE THING"" or ""ALIEN"" style of movies! B+"
4,Very scary,"We randomly streamed this movie. We had a group of about six people, who were all very frightened by it. It was surprisingly good and I would like to add this to my horror collection. We were dubious when we read the blurb about mutant cows and thought ""how good can this be""? Well, it was very well done."
2,Ehh...,Missed the mark. The actors were good but the story was lacking and had horrible monster effects! There were some tense moments that had real potential but then fell flat. Only kept me interested enough to fast forward through to see how it ended...disappointing.
3,Ok flick,"Not a bad movie but not great either. Definitely some scary moments that had me taking my headset off so that I wouldn't have scary sounds blaring into my ear. It was a bit irritating to me that none of these people seemed to have heard of disinfectant as there was only a couple of scenes where it makes an appearance. And believe me, they should have gone through a few gallons of the stuff, not to mention the fact that nobody seems to mind walking around with bodily fluids soaking into their wounds and clothes. And why did they leave bodies lying around when they should have been KILLING IT WITH FIRE??? It takes about 45 minutes into the movie before they finally light up one body. Well, that's it for nitpicking. This movie will probably satisfy any hunger pangs you have for some cheap scares, but you should probably go seeTriangleinstead."
2,Alien on a Dairy Farm,"Really nice camerawork. But the script is weak. Characters are not fully developed, and their behavior is undermotivated, especially towards the end of the film. The monster is just silly. Disappointing."
2,Alien. On a farm.,"I watched this because I have Amazon Prime. If I had paid otherwise, I would've been very disappointed. It is Alien. On a farm. Not near as good. And its not that isolated. People keep coming by. So, if you don't have anything else to do, it's a good way to spend an hour and a half. Otherwise, I'd try another choice."
2,Takes too long to develop.,The story was interesting but the movie took to long to get anywhere. Additionally there also wasn't a single character that I cared about in the film. It didn't matter if they lived or they died. I felt more remorse watching the cows get killed...I don't think that was intentional on the directors part. I hated all the actors especially the girl and the guy. The creatures.... well they were the worse design I have ever seen in a monster flick and I mean out of even the cheesiest ones. If you could imagine a turkey after everyone has carved their piece off that is your monster. Thanksgiving leftovers.'
3,Dark and Dank,Dark film in my opinion.I laughed when he still had his glasses on.Thats all I'll say. No boring 6 page synopsis here.
1,I FELT ISOLATED!!,"Good premise, but it dragged on and on and ..... And it really didn't know where it was going! I found it to be just a movie some people with a bad effects team decided to throw together. Plus, they weren't really sure how to end this debaucle!"
2,The little farm of Horrors,"Theoretically another pointless horror flick with a very sloppy storyline failing to grasp my attention.A plot monotonously presented and rather too absurd to even consider the existence of killer cows.Also with the unpersuasive, weak and shiftless characters, who I felt nothing for in any of their circumstances, though I may give credit to Romanian actor Marcel Iures who has always impressed me in most of his previous films and alas is cast in a humdrum undemanding role of the evil scientist of doom!An unyielding caution to anyone who decides to view this desolate film, make sure you have a strong stomach in owning to the overdone effects and props of blood and entrails that can be seen practically in every single scene."
2,KILLER KOWS,"I have to admit it, I have never seen a movie where mutant cows terrorize people...unless Billy O'Brian watched South Park. To be fair it really wasn't the killer calf per se, but the mutant offspring of the calf. I have also never seen a horror movie with mutant rabid butterflies either, that doesn't mean we need to rush out and make one. The acting was a very stiff. I don't see how anyone would rave over this, it just wasn't that good. The calf delivery scene dragged on forever, even in FF speed. Might be worth watching, but not if you have to pay for it."
4,"B-Movie Premise, A-Grade Scares.","Genetic experiments on an Irish farm unleash a vicious, mutant calf. Incredibly tense, bleak, scary and gruesome tale that transcends it's B-movie premise.Isolation"
5,Faithful,"Great harmonies faithfully rendered, yet delivered with a fresh point of view and a lot of heart. This was obviously a work of love. I would love to hear what he could do with the more introspective songs from Surf's Up or better yet; original tunes. I'm looking forward to John's next offering."
3,ok,"One of Perry's first releases (1982) after he relocated to the UK in 1980, this lp is not an earth shattering event despite having some nice moments on it.Perry's output sounds like he was lacking in focus and inspiration after the loss of the fabled Black Ark- indeed, none of his albums after the loss of the Ark come close to the brilliance of those classic recordings- and the album suffers fromhis trying to noodle too much on it.Not the most recommendable of Perry's post Ark recordings, the lp is mostly for Perry's rabid fans, who will find merit in the efforts."
1,Not at all consistent,"By comparison to the Crossman premier or RWS pellets, these are not very consistent. Inspection bears this out - the skirts are often bent and of varying thicknesses. Out of my Nitro Venom, I can get 2"" groups off hand at 50' with the crossman premier hollowpoints, and RWS Meisterkugelns. 1 out of 5 Daisy pellets won't even hit my 12x12"" pellet trap. Your mileage may vary."
4,Daisy Precision Max .22 pellets,"I use Daisy pellets for several of my pellet guns. These flatheads work great in my 1377 modified, far more bulls than some off the other pellets I have tried so far. The 008 Daisy, Cam over CO2 puncture arm, which I just Love also use these pellets with good groups. Your results may be different because all guns are not the same as most of us know."
5,Great Modem for the Price,I had absolutely no problems with this modem. All modems are sensitive to line noise and I found this to be no different. I had a clean line and got 44kbps true speed. It is easy to set up and the support site and 3com is superb.
2,bigfoot,I dont have a large foot but when I look down they look like men's shoes. The pictures are not representative of the shoe WHEN ITS ON.
5,It was a dollar and some cents with free shipping...,It looks exact to the picture :) buy it.. watch amazon they fluctuate their prices !!
5,Society's Burden,"Robert Navel has asked the central question in summing up the issues that relate to 'To Each Their Own'. Are the issues a genuine stab at society's warped morals or is it simply a vehicle for a good story which, incidentally, tears away the thin fabric and perverse nature of our present morality? If it is contrived, it still asks some very searching questions. If not, it remains a disturbing comment on what being 'civilized' is all about. I prefer to believe that the whole thrust of the story is intended to draw out the very questions we are asking - which is what good writing is all about! C.B Barrie has involved the reader as few other books can. More please. D.M Vaser. Toronto."
5,Simply Superb!,What a story! I'm still reeling from the crunch of having to get though it! I feel like every emotional bone has been put though a meat grinder! I can't even think about reading it again - not yet a while anyway. Phew!
5,"If You Love ASoUE, You Need This!","I bought the 2004 version of this calendar, and not only were there interesting new pictures of our favorite orphans, there was also lots of clues to the story cleverly hidden throughout the different months. Unless you have no sense of humor whatsoever, the calendar also has some witty remarks regarding holidays & the like. But, the bottom line is this--you want some new clues about the V.F.D? About Beatrice? About ASoUE? Then get this calendar!"
3,Sweet Blend,This book is a lovely blend of gardening and cooking. It is a worthwhile read to spark creativity and ideas.
3,Good Jersey Overall,The pro is that it is a reversible mesh jersey.They cons are that each size is very long (long as a skirt) and that the thread tends to break easily.
5,Innovative and relaxing,I am pleased to see Amazon have this title. I have owned this title on vinyl for some time. This was so unique in that Ancient Future melded together the songs of nature with there compositions. The rhythmic pieces provokes ones' imagination. One of my all time favorites.
3,Battries for your Epson digital camera,"I discovered early on that digital cameras like to eat up AA batteries. The rechargable batteries sold to go with the Epson digital camera are 1200 mAh. This means they have a capacity of 1200 milliamps for one hour. They are a great buy for the buck, however, if you wish a better battery, then go for the 1500 mAh. They have them at Radio Shack. They are $5.00 each. They also sell a charger for these units. I learned to carry an extra set with my camera and now I never seem to loose a picture because of battery problems."
4,Everything but optical zoom,"This camera is easy to use, very compact, and comes with everything you need to get started. It would be nice to have an AC adapter (available for extra $), and it would be nice to have an optical zoom (available in different models). It comes with every cable you could want, 4 rechargeable batteries and the recharger (uses 2 at a time). It uses the batteries efficiently as long as you don't use the LCD screen too much..."
1,Useless without the batteries,"This item was advertised to come with rechargeable batteries and a charger. Instead it came with a couple of copper tops. Regular batteries are good for two pictures, and then completely wiped out. Useless."
1,It was not a leather band watch,"The seller publish a leather band watch but it was a stainless steel band. When I has informed this mistake the seller has informed that it did not have the leather band model in stock and, if I would like, I could return the item. I was in a business trip with no time to proceed like this, so I decided to keep the watch. But I'm boring about this."
1,Buyer Beware,"BUYER BEWARE.This is an excellent commentary on an ancient text, not an effective How-To Manual.It did not ""cultivate stillness"" in me -- quite the contrary.I am a moderate person in all things, but these misogynistic concepts of ""Male is Pure/ Female is Impure""made my blood boil. Yes, I realize this is not literal.However, one look at history and society is enough to tell us that these subtle ways of thinking led to horrendous deeds and injustices heaped upon women for centuries.I could not read more than a few pages without my ""stillness"" evaporating into ""wrath"".Call it weakness -- or strength -- but my sense of justice outweighed my search for stillness.Contemporary works on the Tao are much more accessible and inspiring to me."
4,amazing rock & roll noise,"This is the sequel to ""All Systems Go"" obviously, and it contains the singles released by Rocket From the Crypt while they were releasing their last two albums. The songs range from almost radio friendly (Tarzan) to completely radio hostile (UfoUfoUfo). There are also a number of cover tunes, which the band handles with their usual enthusiasm. Less noisy then ASG volume one, ASG volume two is still a celebration of loud guitars, pounding drums, honking horns, and amplified vocals."
3,Women of Grace & Charm,"The quilt blocks are quite beautiful and encourage the use of a wide variety of colors, textures and prints. However, I found myself rewriting the directions in order to construct each block using modern techniques versus strictly piecing as directed to in the book. Maybe the intent of the book was to reproduce these quilt blocks using the methods available to these women of the WWII era, however, rotary cutting ( as instructed in the book) had not been invented yet. So it appears that the book contradicts itself a bit. The actual star pattern was not accurate and therefore had to be reinvented. Overall, I loved the blocks and the stories but abhorred the directions!"
5,great stories,"I'm a quilter but I didn't buy this one for the patterns (though they're interesting). A friend had a copy of this and I was flipping through it and was fascinated about the accounts of women pilots, etc on almost everypage of the book. fascinating history for women! and easy to read."
5,Stand up and salute!,Stirring music! Played it for some friends. I'll be playing in on the 4th for sure!
1,LeapFrog: Letter Factory,"Sample on you-tube was very good. The one we purchased, the actual one, has a very poor voice quality, can not even hear the alphabets clearly. So we did not use it for the child, had to go out and buy another one by a different manufacturer. This is the 1st LeapFrog educational product that we are totally dissatisfied with."
4,Fun and educational,"The songs on the DVD are very catchy, and my daughter loved it. However she would get a little bored with it after about 30 minutes. I would recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it for their preschooler."
5,Simply The Best,"My daughter has been watching this DVD since she was just a few months old. She is almost 2 now at the time of writing this and the DVD has never gotten tiresome to her.It is a nightly request before bedtime and never tends to get annoying to my wife and I (like a certain purple dinosaur most likely would.)It is a good length and keeps her attention the whole time. We have watched her progress educationally with this dvd over time. It was an extreme help with first vocalizing the sound of the letters and then recognizing and saying the names of the letters.I'm amazed how well this show works. I'm a big fan of Sesame Street and she loves Elmo, but Leapfrog's Letter Factory beats out all the other educational DVD's we own."
5,Great for 3 years and UP,WOW. That's all I have to say. I got this for my 3.5 year old son. He got sooo addicted to it from the start. He would ask to watch it over and over. He would tell me when to restart it. Now I'm working on getting him to pronounce 3 letter words. He's 4 now and is really trying. I can't believe how amazing this is. A coworker recommended this. She said the private school her son is in was using it for all their kids. A CD was given to each parent. Parents were encouraged to have the child listen to it 5 times per week.
5,Awesome!,"This is the best way for your toddler to learn letters and sounds. We tried other ways with slow progress, but with this, our 2 1/2 year old learned half of the letters and sounds in a week. I am a teacher and strongly recommend this."
5,BEST DVD EVER,"I have been teaching my 2 and 3 year old daughters letters and sounds from the time they could speak and they did well considering their age HOWEVER until they saw this dvd they could not repeat every sound and identify every letter to see it. Now I can have them look at any random letter of the alphabet and tell me what it is and what sound it makes. The 3 yr old can even read small words now. Whereever we go they see letters and yell them out loud- for example at the grocery store, on someone's shirt,etc. This honestly is the best dvd we own and the girls would watch all day if I let them!!!"
4,nice learning dvd,its a nice dvd and i like the way they teach all thee letters. I gave it four stars because after seeing it only for 3-4 times it gets stuck at certain places and then shuts down!!
5,Excellent,This is an excellent DVD to teach letters and phonics. My son learned much with this and loved the story and characters.
5,Best way to introduce letter sounds to your child,"I am loving this video. It is a great introduction to letter sounds. My daughter started with this when she turned three. We have bought all the dvds in the series. We used these in conjunction with Hooked on Phonics, Bob Books and some Scholastic Readers. She is 4 now and was just evaluated and is reading at a first grade level. My two year old son who has a hard time talking loves this video. If you draw each letter he will tell you the sound that goes with each one. That blows me away and it is all thanks to this DVD.If you don't have it, get it. And don't worry about those reviewers who said it teaches incorrect sounds. It's just not a factor. This DVD works and my two kids are proof of it."
5,Excellent resource for young learners!!,A must have for families with toddlers!!!! My children have learned so much from this video. The alphabet is taught in a new and exciting way.
5,best thing ever!,"This really is the BEST thing ever! First of all i didnt really think my 15 month old son would be slightly interested in this video - but I thought I'd put it on anyway. Well, the first time he watched it, he watched the ENTIRE video - and imitated ""b"" and ""h""!!! I was shocked!! It's been 3 weeks since I bought this viedo and my son (who will be 16 mos old in 2 days) knows ALOT of his letter sounds BY HEART - even if I mix the letters around! He's mastered a, b, c, d, h, m, n, o, p, t, w, y, z - he occasionally sounds out g, r, and s! AMAZING!!"
1,leap frog dvd,"I have not received this product yet. It has been over a month. It was sent to the wrong address, which was not the sender's fault. However, they didn't even have a tracking number for me to track it. It was finally returned to them and I gave them my correct address. That was two weeks ago. Still nothing. I am sure the dvd is fine, but the sender gets a bad review. I will never order anything from Amazon again that isn't straight from ""amazon""."
5,LOVE this DVD!!!,My son JJ (now 3.5 years old) loves this movie and we sing the letters and and their sounds while going about our day! Very catchy tune and the kids love it!
5,Great LEARNING DVD for little ones,"My son is 15 months old, and he knows ALL the letters of the alphabet, mainly from watching this DVD. The mealtime is a disaster unless he is distracted by watching something (and even then it is EXTREMELY difficult to find a video that would hold his attention long enough to finish his meal). This video not only holds his full attention through the end (and it is much longer than Baby Einstein or Baby Genius Videos), he has learnt a lot from it. Fully endorsed!"
5,A must have!,"I was a teacher for 10 years. My own children, who are toddlers, knew all of their letters and many of the sounds. However, after watching this DVD twice they know all the sounds. They love the DVD, and have watched it many times. I bought the 3 DVD set with flash cards, and they flash cards are a great resource to reinforce what they've learned. I'm going to start buying this DVD as gifts for anyone in the right age bracket."
5,Leap Frog Lettery Factory,"Purchased 7 DVDs and offered to friends with 2 to 5 year olds. Receiving rave reviews. Not only are kids learning letter names, but they are learning letter sounds, which is a large jump on learning to read. Highly recommend."
5,Really Engaging,"My 3 year old loves this! She already knew her letters, but this DVD helped her to learn the letter sounds. She is an auditory learner, so anything set to music really sticks for her. I just bought the word factory, and code word. I am excited to discover how she works with them as well. Absolutley worth the price!"
4,Great educational video,"This is a great video that teaches the basic letter sounds. I got it when my youngest was almost 3 and his brother was 4. They both already knew their letters and most of the sounds, but this really solidified it for them. They were quickly ready for the Talking Words Factory and the Code Word Caper. The Code Word Caper introduces long-vowel sounds which are not addressed in the first two videos. The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is because one of the characters, Mr. Websley, is a cantankerous, bossy, and demanding fellow. Not exactly a great role model for the kids. I'm VERY picky about what my children watch, so I'm guessing that for most people, this would not be terribly bothersome."
4,Good addition to teaching phonemic awareness,"I bought this DVD to supplement and add variety to the way my kids exposed to learning letters and sounds. I have an 18 month old and a 2 1/2 year old. My 2 year old realy likes it. I skip the introduction period and forward to the scene where they start with the letter A. The beginning to way to loon for my son, that is why I skip it. I would give it 5 stars, except some of the rponunciation of letters is incorrect. Especially for the letter L (where did they get the UULL sound?). There are a few more letter, like O, M, N, R, but they are not as profound as L.Other than that, great DVD. I am also getting my son Fridge phonics set, so he can play with lettes and still hear the familiar song."
5,Great learning tool,"I was having trouble with my 3-year-olds learning their alphabets.I ordered this and kept it in my truck to play while we drive, since it's a fairly short video.My kids were singing the songs, recognizing letters better AND able to make the sounds that go with the letters.Flashcards and books are good; but there's something special that takes place when learning is combined with songs and characters."
5,Really Works!,"I love this video, and the other ones made by Leap Frog. I taught kindergarten last year and I had six kids that just weren't learning their letters and sounds. I sent each child home with this video in April and within a month, only one of the students didn't know all of their letters and sounds. They all made huge learning gains. I knew that it had worked with my own children, but I hadn't tried it with students until last year. This year I am teaching 1st Grade and I am sending the video home with a couple of students again. I am very excited to see the results."
5,wonderful teaching tool,"My son and daughter were both introduced to phonics using this dvd, and both learned all of the letter sounds within a couple of weeks at ages 3 and 4. Even though I have never pressured my children to read early, my son is now in kindergarten and reading at a second grade level. I attribute part of that to the leap frog dvds because they enjoyed them and were given such a positive impression of reading through them, as well as our family's love of books in general. This is my second time purchasing this dvd (we lost the first one during a move). I highly recommend this product."
2,My son ejoys it,"I bought this item , that was a suggestion to help my son memorize the letters and their sound. He enjoys watching it and helps him a lot recognizing the letters and their sounds. It is perfect for a pre-k child ."
5,good review ready for resale,The video is good and ready to be resold or switched with the number factory or something more challenging.FMLyons
1,Leap Frog Letter Factory,"The DVD was in dirty packaging. I cleaned it off before opening because I did not want to touch it. The DVD does not work. I have tried it on several players to make sure it was not my DVD player. The DVD stops every 3 or 4 minutes and skips ahead to various places in the DVD. It is not usable. I only spent $3 , but it said it was in Good condition. It defeinately is not."
1,Incorrect sounds,"It was distressing to hear the video tell the viewer things like ""L says 'UL'"". Though the video was fun and engaging, its whole purpose is to teach letter sounds, so mistakes are inexcusable. L doesn't say ""UL"" and R doesn't say ""er""."
1,Did Not Meet Expectations,"I have had several friends who love this video, and whose children learned a lot from watching it, so I bought it. I thought it was more of an educational DVD that reviewed letter sounds. The letter sounds are introduced, but in the context of the plot of a cartoon show. Most cartoons annoy me, and this is one of them. There's a lot of extra stuff that I don't necessarily want my almost-two-year-old saying, ""Okie-Dokie-Artichokey"" being one of them. And it's annoying to sit through all of the beginning and end plot of the show surrounding the alphabet sounds. I'd recommend watching someone else's copy before buying one for yourself.We also bought the Leap Frog alphabet fridge magnet set that uses the same catchy song...highly recommend that over this video to teach the sounds."
3,LEAP FROG LETTER,"I WAS AND AM STILL NOT COMPLETERLY SATISFIED WITH THIS VIDEO ALTHOUGH THE LETTERS ARE GREAT, AND ARE HELPING ME TO INTERACT WITH MY SON, BEOFRE HE HAS TO ATTEND SCHOOL IN THE FALL..."
1,Great Video,I purchased this DVD for my 22month and she loves this video. She watches in our vehicle on the way to daycare or where ever we go and she is mesmerized. She can now say all her letter and the sounds of the letters because of watching this video!! Thank you leap frog for this great video.. Would highly recommend.
5,Great Learning Tool!,"My 26 month old knows almost all of her letters after watching this movie for a few weeks. It's amazing! I let her watch one show a day and she always chooses ""Leap & Lily"". Love it!"
5,leapfrog letters,the dvd is very fun to watch the kids pick it over other dvds because they love it and its educational
5,A Must Have DVD!,Letter Factory is a must have DVD. My daughter absolutely loves it and wants to watch it all the time. Kudos to Leapfrog!
4,Highly recommended!,I first bought this DVD based on a strongly positive recommendation from a trusted friend/pediatrician with a child slightly older than mine. We have only shown our 18 month old daughter this DVD twice and are already appreciating benefits. The first viewing she was only mildly interested. By the end of the second she was mimicking the letters and phonix songs. I can't wait to see how quickly she learns with this. Complements the Leap Frog letter toys very nicely.
5,Pleased mother of ABC spouting toddler!,"My son LOVED this- it's catchy and entertaining. Within a couple of entirely voluntary viewings he had everything down and the phonics too rather than a jarbled and meaningless ABCDEFG recitation. It's too cute hearing him say ""B"" says bah! A definite great buy.And highly recommended is the Math Circus as well when they get around 2 1/2 -3 years old."
5,Fabulous educational DVD!!,"My daughter knew her ABC's at 20 months and getting her this DVD really helped her master it, along with the sounds of each letter. She only had to watch it a few times and had it down pat! Then we moved on to the Talking Word Factory and she was reading simple books at age 2 1/2. She is almost 3 now and reads at a 2nd - 3rd grade level. People are amazed!!! This DVD is a must for any child interested in their ABC's."
5,Great learning video!,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves ""Letter Factory""! She asks to watch it all the time! In a matter of about two weeks, she has learned every letter sound! It's amazing! I even find that she is breaking words apart into sounds to try to figure out what letters make up the word. This is an excellent introduction, and reinforcement, to letters and their sounds! The characters are fun, and the catchy little tunes are very appealing to kids! I highly recommend this video!"
4,Great Sing-Along,"Not quite sure if my daughter (23 months) understands completely, but she sure caught on quickly to the songs. She's happy, I'm happy."
4,My gal likes it,I thought it's too early for my 2yo gal to learn Alphabet yet but she loves watching the cartoon and the songs. She watches it at least once a day and is able to recognise most of the letters now.
5,Can't take his eyes off it,"I just bought this DVD for my child and he loves it. He's only 16 months old and he's already trying to say some of the letters. He watches it every day. Very good DVD. I was also told that the old version of this doesn't have lower case letters, but this one does."
5,Great for younger children too!,"Even though the recommneded age is 2 to 5, I bought this for my son when he was not quite a year old. He is seventeen months old and already repeats the letter sounds that he hears on this video and has a vocabulary of about ten words. He gets a kick out of making these sounds and the praise he gets from us. He loves this video and I would definitely recommend this learning tool. He is getting the Talking Words Factory DVD for Christmas."
5,Wants to watch it over and over again!,"Just like all the the other reviewers we are amazed at what this DVD has done for our just turned 3 yr old. She got this for her birthday and within one week is walking around the house constantly singing the entire alphabet phonetically. She LOVES this DVD. Even her older sister (age 9) is glued to it. I found in her backpack a piece of paper she had drawn in school which has every single letter from this DVD dressed in the exact costume they wear in the movie. (ie the K is in the karate outfit, the S has the rattle snakes tail and tongue, the P is puffy like popcorn etc.) We also bought the Word Factory DVD at the same time and they love that one too!"
5,great learning dvd,My son learned a lot from this dvd. He was able to repeat and identify letters of the alphabet easily. We liked it so much we sent it to a friend.
5,Works for my preschooler,"My 3 year old will sit and watch this movie. I am not going to say it is his favorite, he would honestly rather be watching the 1966 batman, don't ask me why, but thankfully he will sit though this too. After he watched this movie a few times he was saying the letter sound when the letter came up.One of the annoying things is the kids pick up the letter sounds exactly how they say them and when the W comes up it says the sound about 3 times in a row, now my kids will say the W sound multiple times because they think that is how it pronounced."
4,Fun Way of Learning Letters,I bought this video for my two year old. So far he has only watched it once and got bored with it by the time we reached the letter R. He is a little young for it but I still like the way the letter sounds are presented and I think it will be a great educational tools as he gets a little older.
5,great dvd for kids,my daughter loves this dvd. it was recommended to me by my pediatrician. so glad i bought it. she has been watching it for a month and she can pick out letters and make their sounds. she sings the song constantly.
5,LeapFrog: Letter Factory,I purchased this LeapFrog DVD for my youngest granddaughter. We have yet to watch the enjoy DVD. Her attention span isn't long enough yet. The colors are nice and bright on the DVD.
5,EVERYONE MUST BUY THIS!,I bought this DVD on a Thursday morning and by Friday afternoon both of my boys (just turned 3 and 4) knew EVERY letter and EVERY letter sound from A-Z! I have never been so amazed by a video. I can teach my 4 year old to read. Both of the boys go around the house all day singing the letter sounds. I am not kidding when I say they know EVERY letter and sound from A-Z. I suggest everyone buy this video. I'm just hoping they come out with letter flash cards to match the letters in the video.
4,Emphasis on uppercase letters,"This is a very good product. It teaches the alphabet and the letter sounds in an engaging way, through songs and animation. My toddler just loves it, and showing her the DVD is about the only way to get her seated in the car seat quietly.I give this only 4 stars because of some slight flaws:- the sounds of the vowels are not consistent because the characters in the dvd sound them differentlye.g it's difficult to make out the difference between 'A', 'E', 'U'; 'O' sounds like 'ohhh' and 'ahhh'- the dvd doesn't differentiate between long and short vowels- there is an emphasis on uppercase letters; lettercase letters are important for emergent reading cos they occur more frequently in the written language.My toddler has learnt letters that have similar looking upper and lowercase letters. However, she has trouble recognising the rest of the alphabet. My friend's toddler, however, has learnt both upper and lower case letters from this dvd."
5,Excellent DVD,"Just wanted to add my 5-star review to all the others. Bought this for my 3 1/2 year old, and within 3 viewings he absolutely know all his letter sounds. He hadn't really been interested before in learning them, but this DVD really did it for him. He loves it! Bonus: the 18 month old, who only catches a little of the DVD once in a while (he doesn't get very much TV), knows some of his letter sounds too! Really cute DVD for a good price. You won't be sorry you bought it."
5,My Preschooler is mesmerized by The Letter Factory,My 4 year old daughter absolutely loves this fun and educational DVD.She wants to watch it every day and has tons of questions about the content after she is done watching it.It is amazing how it sparked so much interest in letters and the alphabet.
5,absolutely fantastic!,"This DVD taught my 20-month-old his letter sounds! He actually sounds out signs on the street now(at 23 months). He has great joy in his ability to grasp some of the meaning of all the letters he sees in his world.The DVD is pedagogically brilliant!! Plus, it's even interesting for adults even after a few viewings. The background scenery has lots of interesting, humerous detail that you can't catch the first time.I sincerely hope Leap Frog creates more DVDs of this high calibre!!!!Hey, I'm a teacher, so I'll take it upon myself to grade the makers of this DVD :-))A+++++++++++++++++++++!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"My 2 yr old grandson loves it,,,, but I am disappointed.","After reading the great reviews about this product I bought it for my 30 month old grandson. He already knew his alphabets by sight and could tell you each letter as he pointed them out. So I purchased this video to help him learn what sounds each letter makes. He absolutely loves this video he plays it over and over. But when I got it and played it for him I immediately noticed that some of the letter sounds were incorrect most noticable for example the L the O and the R have the incorrect sounds. Despite this, I believe that this DVD is very good for getting toddlers interested in the alphabet and learning their letters. Therefore I can only give it three stars because I think it needs some improvement."
2,"Visually overstimulating, contrived story and phonemic mistakes","This DVD is not one of the better learning tools out there. The audio and visuals are overstimulating and distracting from the message, the story line is contrived and hard for little ones to follow and the characters pronounce the letters incorrectly in many cases.I can see that it might be entertaining for some kids, if they are used to fast pace animation and the unfortunate jump-cut editing pervasive in children's programming. But my 2.5-year-old was bored with it and didn't want to watch it again. He enjoys story-based programs (Curious George, Little Polar Bear, etc.) and lesson-based programs (Brainy Baby ABCs), so it's not a matter of his not being able to follow along. I think it was just too much unnecessary noise and action."
2,not a hit in our house,"My 2-year-old twins will watch this, but they never ask for it and seem bored by it. I would recommend Richard Scarry's Best Ever ABC video over this one (we have that one and they love it, sing along with it and ask to watch it over and over)."
3,"Okay, but not great",I bought this for my three year old. I was hoping for something entertaining to help her learn her letters because flash cards were not holding her attention. Well she was bored about two minutes in. It would probably be better for a younger child but it didn't hold her attention and after trying several days in a row of watching the video with her she just got mad that she wasn't watching Mickey Mouse or Dora.
5,Great learning tool for letter sounds,"This is a great video. My 2 year old son adores it.At first viewing, I thought he would hate it -- it seemed so dull. But, it goes to show that adults shouldn't judge by their own tastes -- as my son really loves it. Moreover, I credit it for making learning all the letter sounds fun and easy to learn.Great video. My son is already sounding out simple words -- a great product by leapfrog."
5,4 year old really enjoyed,"My 4 1/2 year old got for xmas; I thought he might be too old for it, but he has seen it several times in a row and enjoys it more than the Word Factory(though both are very good). If they're going to be watching tv, may as well be something educational!"
5,my twins love it,My twin 26 month boys love this movie. They have been watching it for a few weeks now and still seem interested. One of them has already learned his letters.
5,Excellent,"This is the best learning tool I've seen so far, my son who is only 2 knows his letters and their sounds. I know that may be hard to believe but it is the absolute truth. I started playing it for him at 14 months old, by 18 months he was asking me to put it on. I remember thinking at the time oh he's too young...but what the h@*!, it couldn't hurt."
5,A Hit with Our Little Guy!,Our babysitter came across this series and told me our 18-month old loved them! He could watch this one over and over again and never tire of it. And he's already learning his letters and sounds as a result!
5,Great Learning Tool,"My two year old granddaughter and her friend LOVE this video. We adults like it and sing along also. It goes through each letter of the alphabet, showing the letter in caps and small case, saying the letter and it's sound and cleverly placing the animated letters in a situation that is easy to remember their sound and what words begin with their letter."
5,My 1 1/2 year old loves it!,"I turn this video on in the car for my 20-month old when we plan to drive longer than 15 minutes. He LOVES it! He sings along as they say ""The M says mmmm, ..."", etc and knows most of his letters already! I don't really like to use the television as a babysitter too often but I don't feel guilty at all when he watches (and loves) such an educational video as this!"
1,Terrible graphics,"I purchased this DVD in a bargain bin, I can see why it was there. The visual graphics are horrible, like 1980's cartoon quality. My kids make it through the first 5 minutes and are begging to shut it off. They enjoy the leapfrog toys, but if you are going to show your kids a DVD to teach them letters or sounds I think preschool prep is better (graphics suck but it gets to the point and the information sticks!) and the your baby can read series. Both of my kids watched these along with the Blues Clues shape detectives, at 2 years they could identify all letters, shapes, colors and numbers. At 3 my son could read anything and everything."
5,Fabulous!,"From this video, my son (almost 2 1/2) can tell me the letters when i point them out as well as make their sound. i never got these results using flashcards or even the alphabet card to his leap pad. he absolutely loves watching the ""letter show."" he just got the words factory and is hooked on it, too."
5,Awesome!,"If you are a bit daunted by helping your preschooler learn their letters and want a bit of entertaining help - this is for you. My neice learned her letters and their sounds by 18 months, each of mine learned while they were around two or so. My son would repeatedly ask for the ""Frog Show!"" so it never felt forced at all. This is a really great DVD for kids!"
5,Awesome and educational!,"My 2 and 4 year old daughters love this show! Before I had kids I taught 2nd grade, so as I teacher I find this video to be exceptional! They are learning a little song and action to attach to each letter sound in their minds. I would recommend this to any primary or K teacher too! Home school moms...this is a must!"
5,Leap Frog ABC's,Both my almost 4 year old daughter and almost 2 year old son love this video and I love that it's helping reinforce their knowledge on their ABC's. This is one video I don't mind my children watching over and over again.
5,awesome,"my son's kidnergarten teacher recommended this. he saw it in preschool, and is a special needs child. also has a speech impairement. this dvd is AWESOME! my son loves it and always wants to watch it. it's very practical and is helping him learn his phonics. for parents it gets a little annoying due to the songs and repetition, but that's how kids learn. HIGHLY RECOMMEND to any child trying to learn letters, sounds, and how to read!"
5,pre-k great!!!!,i bought this last yr for a 5yr old and a 3yr old and they love it. they can sit and watch and learn all at the same time and love it.
5,My kids love it,"My 3 year old calls it, ""My movie."" The other kids, ages 5,8, and 10 want to watch it also. I like to hear them sing the songs after the video is over. We've only watched it a few times."
5,Very fun fro my 3 year old,My 3 year old loves to sing along and her older sisters join in the act. It's a really nice introduction to letters and sounds. I purchased this years ago for my older children and had to buy a new one for the latest 3 year old since the old one was scratched. I haven't found anything they've enjoyed more.
5,Helped my son learn his letters!,"After this being recommended to me by several other moms, I bought it for my 2 yr old son. The only tv he watches is Super Why and Sesame Street and the occasional toddler movie, so he is not a huge 'sit and watch tv' kid. This did not hold his interest, nor mine, the first several times we tried it. But then he grew more interested in and started interacting with it, repeating the letter sounds and shouting out the letters. Now he asks to watch it at least once a week, and just as my mom friends told me, I have noticed an increase in understanding, as well as interest, in the alphabet, letters and their sounds from him. I am a believer now!"
5,My 4 year old loves it,"I have bought several ABC videos for my son, read to him a lot, and have tried ""teaching"" the ABCs. Up until we bought this video he was still having problems with letter recognition-forget sounds. A week later, watching it 1x a day, he is singing the song and can tell me what each letter says! And he's interested in words! This video is a bit slow for parents, but great for kids. It teaches correct consonants and short vowel sounds that kids can put together to make words (as opposed to many videos that inadvertently add vowel sounds after the consonants)."
5,FANTASTIC,My 2 1/2 year old loves it and knows all his letters and their sounds. The songs are great and we sing them again and again.
5,Great Video,"My two year old loves to watch this. I bought it because she started to be curious about letters. She would point to every letter and say ""S"" or ""T"". We've had it for almost a month and with watching it twice a week and pointing out letters during the day she knows almost half of her alphabet. She loves to go through and sing the sounds of the letters also. It keeps her very entertained in the car. I love that it is only about 30 minutes also. It gives me just enough time to get some cleaning done without feeling bad about having her watch TV too long."
5,great learning video,"This video taught my 3 year old phonics and now my 22 month old is learning them as well. I learned to read by sight, not phonetically so this video has actually taught me as well! We watch limited videos, but when we do I always try to sit down and watch them with the kids. It's fun to sing along and now that we know the song and sounds we can sing about our letters in the car or around the house. Great learning tool!"
5,AMAZING LEARNING TOOL!,"My daughter has been watching this since she was 18 mos, by 2 she knew all her letters on sight and by 3 she knew all the sounds! I've recommended this DVD to SO many people, and it's worked for all of them. Kids don't even realize they are learning! It's fantastic!"
5,Worth every penny!,I purchased this DVD after reading some of the reviews on Amazon and decided to order it for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She loves it! It was everything I had hoped it would be. She already knows all of her letter sounds and can't get enough of the DVD. It was definately worth it and makes me feel good knowing she is watching something educational. LeapFrog definately lived up to its reputation with this one.
5,Helped my 3 year old learn his letters,"Before I ordered this product, I was having lots of problems getting my 3 year old to learn his letters. After watching this DVD a few times, he was walking around the house saying all the letter sounds and making letters out of blocks and telling me what they said. I would buy this for any child to help them learn their letters and sounds."
5,GREAT ITEM!,I have twins boys and they love this DVD! They actually ask to watch it and it has helped them finish learning their ABC's in a fun way. The phonics part of it is very helpful for them to get ready for Kindergarten.Highly recommend it!
4,Great jumping off point,"My 3.5 year old had learned to recognize both upper and lower case letters, and I was looking for a way for him to learn letter sounds, (that wasn't boring old Mama teaching him). I checked this out from the library as I was unsure if he would like LeapFrog. Three viewings and he had it down. 6 months later we are on Lesson 6 inThe Reading Lesson: Teach Your Child to Read in 20 Easy Lessonsand he is reading theBob Books, Set 1: Beginning Readers.I am sure results vary, but the catchy tune was just what my son needed to jump start his reading."
5,LeapFrog - Letter Factory,This is a really fun way for kids to learn their letters and letter sounds. I wish I would've gotten this when my oldest child was younger. I do daycare and am amazed at how fast they are learning their sounds!
3,It's Ok,"Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't understand the LOVE for this DVD. It's ok. It took forever to get going and my son just about lost interest before it got to the letter sounds. My just 2 year old will watch part of it (huge for him). He's learned so much from us and from the leap frog magnet letter set, that this is just a reinforcement. I'd love to see the focus be primarily on the lower case letters next time."
3,"Annoying, but kids love it","I purchased this DVD for my 3 year old son. At first he was very bored with it (or at least acted like it) and I was surprised when HE asked to watch it again. Next time around he seemed more interested in it. I haven't noticed any progress yet, but we've only seen it a couple of times.The characters are fun (kickin' K's and such) but the MUSIC is VERY annoying. The same song over and over again. 26 times is bit much to bear!"
3,Bored toddler here,"Admitedly, my 29 month old daughter is a ball of energy, but she absolutely loves anything to do with the alphabet, so I thought she'd love this dvd. She was so bored with it that she kept coming over to me during the show and requesting other videos that she has. She just did not get into this. I think maybe because it's cartoon format. Cartoons don't hold her interest unless they are interactive (asking the audience questions, etc.) Otherwise, she prefers live people, puppets, etc. But there was no opportunity for her to interact with this cartoon, so it didn't hold her attention. Maybe she'll like it more when she gets older. I have to admit though, I was a little disappointed and thought it was kind of boring too."
3,A bit disappointed,"After reading the great reviews about this product I bought it from Amazon.com and waited anxiously for it to be delivered. When I got it and played it for my two year old daughter I noticed that some of the letter sounds were incorrect for example the L and the O both have the incorrect sounds. Despite this, I believe that this DVD is very good for getting toddlers interested in the alphabet and learning their letters."
2,Good idea! But could be improved on!,I got this a gift. I was told that it helped my cousins kids with learning their letters. I finally watched it after having it for a year. I liked the concept but was disappointed.1. Teaching of morals.....older brother lies and there's no consequence or talking about that.2. The video only talks about one sound that each letter makes....but some of the letters make more than one sound. So disappointed because we have the leapfrog magnetic letters and they sing the same song but they incorporate the different sounds the letter can make.
2,OK video but contains some phonics mistakes,"This is a good video...NOT great as people seem to think. There are some grave mistakes, for example, the 'O' and the 'U' both seem to say 'Ah', the 'L' says 'Ul' and the 'R' says 'Er'.Im distressed that my 2-year old sems to be learning the letter sounds incorrectly. Even when I try to correct the video, she seems to go with the sounds made on the video. Im kind of turned off by the Leap Frog company. How could they have let this kind of stuff fall through the cracks?"
2,"""Okey dokey artichokey"" - REALLY??","If you let your kid watch this be warned: the main character says ""okey dokey artichokey"" and other annoying things throughout this video. I couldn't stand it. It might be an otherwise great DVD but okey dokey artichokey was a dealbreaker for me."
5,fun and energetic,This DVD is incredibly effective. My children love to watch it. I was looking for something more fun than flashcards to teach letters and found it! Even my one year old shouts out the names of letters and sounds now.
5,remarkably successful,"This video is amazing. I thought it was pretty boring at first and wasn't at all impressed with the songs, but after only watching the video a couple of times, my daughter was saying the letter sounds. Works like a charm."
5,Great DVD To Help Preschoolers Connect Letters with Sounds,"I purchased this DVD when my son had just turned 2. He enjoyed the movie for the entertainment value, but didn't really grasp the letters and sounds quite yet. It had been a while since he's watched so I pulled it out again (he's 3 now) and it was a completely different watching / learning experience for him. He already knew his alphabet, but was very interested in learning the sounds that go with them. This DVD did a great job of showing him that connections between the letters and their sounds. Now he's always asking me ""what does D say or what does L say?"""
5,Amazing!,The letter factory is amazing! My son has been going to a wonderful preschool and knew his letters and after two days of the dvd...he knows all of the letter sounds. I am amazed! This is definatly a great learning tool!
5,Taught my 21 month old his sounds!,"I bought this as part of the 5 DVD set. My son already knew all his letters and after watching this DVD for a week he knows all his sounds as well! There's also a great game on the main menu that quizzes them on sound recognition.The only thing I would change about this DVD is that they don't have the long vowel sounds like they do in the Leap Frog Fridge phonics, and as a former teacher the pronunciation for ""L"" leaves a bit to be desired.Other than that, the DVD is very entertaining and captures and retains the child's attention."
4,Leapfrog Letter Factory,"The Leapfrog Letter Factory offers an entertaining, highly motivating way for young children to learn the alphabet including slow learners. Kindergarten teachers who use it in their classrooms and parents give it rave reviews. I am using it with one of my students who is not motivated and does not know his alphabet in the 3rd grade. In as little as 2 weeks, his ability to identify the lettes and sounds improved by 30%. I was amazed!"
5,Blows flash cards away!,"After watching this DVD about 4 times (you know how kids are about watching the same DVD again and again), even my 24 month old started sounding out and recognizing letters. This is a must have."
5,Instant Success!!!,"I bought this dvd for my 23 month old daughter a little over a month ago and she absolutly loves it!! She asks to watch it all the time and I have no problem with that because I know what she is watching is educational. Now whenever she sees letters, she can recognize them and even recites their sound. I highly recommend this dvd!!!"
5,Great DVD,My 2 year old son loves this DVD - I don't feel guilty letting him watch it over and over again because it is so educational. He recites his ABCs because of this DVD. Highly recommend this DVD.
4,Great,This movie is great. I bought it for my 19 month old and she loves it. She has already started repeating some of the sounds.
5,Great!,If your child is having problems with knowing letters and sounds of the letters. This is great video for everychild to have. They will learn it!
5,Helps a lot,My daughter is 3 and her recognition of her letters and letter sounds has greatly improved since she has been watching this movie! My 6 year old likes to watch it too just for fun!
3,"""After God""","Don't get me wrong, this is a god book for what Bishop John Shelby Spong would call ""beleivers in exile"", but at times the author comes off with a Eurocentric justification of past wrongs done by the church as in page 106 where he states,""It may indeed be that an overwhelming and annihilating system of religious TERRORISM was needed in order to discipline the hunter-gatherers into becoming GOOD CITIZENS"". This kind of talk does little for the advancment of religious though!"
2,oh dear,"Cupitt is one of these Christians who don't believe in God... hmm... while he writes very well and explains his position at length and with great literary talent, in terms of actual logical philosophy, next to Kant, Nietzsche, Sartre, Aristotle or even fellow postmodernist types like Derrida or Foucalt, Cupitt's mistakes are all too obvious - and there's one on almost every page."
5,Great Product,"Fits my 15"" macbook pro perfectly. Soft material that cleans well while protecting my screen. My macbook closes just fine with the cloth in between. I ordered a black and so far it does not look dirty even though I constantly wipe my screen. It came in the mail folded up but after a couple of days of sitting in between my screen and keyboard it is now straight. Great product and worth the investment!"
4,Works well,"I purchased this for my new HP Envy laptop, since my previous machine got quite a few scratches on the screen due to friction with the keyboard.It works perfectly and it is much more practical than installing a screen protector. Plus you can use it to wipe the screen / keyboard when needed.Only minor complaint: when used for cleaning the screen it is not as effective as a high quality microfiber cloth.You can safely throw it in the washing machine."
2,"Bad movie , great body","Well, the 1980's had its share of bad films, and this one is no exception. The plot is as simplistic as it gets; a nerd wants to have the perfect body so he can be happy, only to discover there is a price to pay. ( Be careful what you wish for, you might just get it, true happiness comes from within, take your pick!) The acting is terrible, but let's be honest girls we are not gonna watch a movie called ""Hunk"" for the acting or the dialogue. We want to look at a hot body and John Allen Nelson definitely has that. Unfortunately, the scenes with Hunk showing off his gorgeous muscular bod are few & far between. Hunk is harmless fun, but if you want to drool over a beautiful body, you'll have alot of fast forwarding to do."
2,"Great body, bad movie","Well, the 1980's had its share of bad films, and this one is no exception. The plot is as simplistic as it gets- a nerd wants the perfect body so he can be happy, only to discover there is a price to pay. (you know, be careful what you wish for because you might just get it: true happiness comes from within, hey! Take your pick.) The acting is not good, but come on girls we are not gonna watch a movie called ""Hunk"" for the story or dialogue. We want to look at a hot body, and John Allen Nelson definitely has that. Unfortunately, the scenes with Hunk showing off his gorgeous body are few & far between. ""Hunk"" is harmless fun, but if you just want to drool over a muscular tanned body, you'll need to fast forward alot."
2,Really bad acting,"I usually like older 80s romantic comedies, but Hunk just takes 80s corniness to a new level. The acting is atrociously bad, and I say that as someone who typically forgives weak acting. The basic plot is fine - a guy sells soul to the devil in order to become a hunk - but the plot twists just don't make sense. Why does the devil keep going back in time to create more evil? Is he actually trying to change the past? A TV host nearly drives a jeep in reverse off a pier and doesn't seem capable of braking during the minute or so it's going on? Isn't it a bit all too convenient that the Devil's assistant falls in love with the main character? On top of all that, the guy's name is Hunk! I'd definitely recommend avoiding this movie."
3,Silly Fun Humor......,"Well, this was not the best of comedies, but still a very funny movie, that I am sure not too many people own. I have not purchased it yet, but plan on doing so now that I know it is for sale!"
5,One of the greatest documentaries of WWII I've seen,"This 3-hour single disc covers every aspect of the war. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone interested or someone that may be a teacher. The narrator Dale Reed is exellent in guiding the story as well as adding insight. Also recommended ""The Korean War"" by Marathon Music & Video."
1,garbage alert,I bought it to educate my kids about the history and events of WWII. This set fails miserably. It's mostly unexciting footage with many repeating scenes and many times there is clearly no connection between the battles covered and the footage.The storytelling is abysmal and the pictures are unexciting.
5,GREAT COLOR FOOTAGE,GREAT SET FOR LITTLE MONEY. 5 DVDS FOR ABOUT $20. SOMEONE COMPLAINED OF COLORIZED FOOTAGE. SO WHAT. THIS WAS NOT FILMED WHEN COLOR FILM WAS UNIVERSALLY USED. ENJOY WHAT IS PRESENTED. IF YOU EXPECT FOOTAGE THAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A MOVIE THEATRE TRY AGAIN. IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOME OLD B&W FOOTAGE WITH A LITTLE LIFE BREATHED INTO YOU GOT TO GET THIS.
4,NOT COLORIZED,"There are too many ignorant souls out there complaining that the footage in this doco is colorized, it clearly states right on the tin that it is not colorized and that it is restored footage from actual color film that was taken at the time. Much of which had never been seen before. Get your facts straight before bad mouthing a product and for god's sake get a clue, footage that old, color or not is bound to show some fading over time, of course the color is not that good in some of it, color film was extremely new then."
3,Old material in a new package,"Potential buyers should be made aware that this History Channel presentation dates from the mid 1980s. As such it lacks some of the ""spit and polish"" of more recent THC offerings, but the subject matter and footage are of course much older than that.Overall it is a decent package considering the amount of material and the price, but I found it somewhat lacking compared with the shows that THC currently produces, which tend to have better narration, better music, much better maps, and a more professional presentation.Video quality is about as good as one could expect, and the audio is basic and serviceable stereo."
2,A Totally Third Rate Production,"In short, too much repeat footage. This DVD pack is sub average at its very best. The Highlights are the program on the battle with the Africa Corps. and the program on the Battle of the Bulge. The other 2 programs are made up of repeat footage. Their are virtually no insights given and the feeling of the entire set is one of an impersonal overview. And not just any overview but an overview that is rushed, its as if the narrators (there are 2 and they are both inept) need to make a mad dash to the toilet and just want to get this damn thing over with. If you are looking for something comprehensive and insightful this clunk is a total waste of time."
2,Lackluster clip show,"I have seen some pretty good productions from the History Channel. This is not one of them. It views like a text book, with rapid fire black and white war footage, and facts. The information is good, however it is difficult to watch as the narrator changes with the footage (which is often). Do not expect to see much along the way of synopsis or historian commentary / insights as you view this dvd."
1,Duped!,"I bought this DVD because it had what looked like a History Channel logo on the front and as such I assumed it was another one of their outstandings series. Boy was I wrong! It's a series from the 50s or 60s with lame graphics and commentary. It has decent real-life video, but I expected so much more for my money. I'd send it back, but since it is already opened I'm sure they would not accept it. Plus it's not worth my time and effort. Don't buy this DVD because it's just not very good."
4,"Yes, It really is colorized.","Sorry to say to Buddha Dharma, that this is indeed mostly colorized footage. I work with a company doing documentaries and we have footage that was dubbed directly from the National Archives in Washington, D.C. I saw exactly the same shots in this set that are on our dubs in Black & White. If they were available in color, we would have gotten them in color from the National Archives. Also, there was a ""film damage"" filter added. If you look at the DVD's at X2 or X4 speed, watch for the same film scratch, hair, and dirt patterns going by. There is very little color (combat) footage from World War 2. From what I have heard, (I have not researched this and don't know the true facts, but...) the amount of color combat footage from WW2 is in the low (less than 100) hours range. To me the colorized footage is okay, but the box labelling is extremely misleading."
3,world war two pacific,"although the tape and story were good, four of the six tapes had areas of pauses and hesitations which were very annoying"
3,Not Sure Yet!,I think Im gonna have to get another months supply before I can tell if theres a difference. Its been 1 month and its probably now just getting really in my system... Update on mood changes later....
1,Don't buy this book,"I have never seen a book so full of factual errors as this one. There are better books out there on this subject - don't waste your money.Incidentally, Herman is a well-known white supremacist. Potential customers should keep this in mind (even if they don't have a problem with it)."
4,difficult read - but very insightful,"Arthur Herman is a detail person and has undertaken massive research to produce this book. I learned a great deal about the history of pessimistic thinking by ""intellectuals"" looking for ways to have thier governments take care of them and ""solve"" societies ills. When applied to today's ""intellectuals"" I learned that there really is not much new thinking going on. Difficult read, but worth the effort."
2,"Good scholarship, bad conclusions","Herman just close his eyes for many of the propphetic pessimistic insights that he criticizes.The rich nations of the world are acting like ancient usurers, lending money to the desperate poor on terms that cannot possibly be met and, thus, steadily acquiring more and more control over the lives and assets of the poor.But, are basic rights of human existence confined to those civilized societies wealthy enough to afford them? Everyone's values are defined by what they will tolerate when it is done to others.Civilization is a movement and not a condition, a voyage and not a harbor. - Arnold Toynbee"
5,I love this game soooooo much! ^w^,"This game is really fun to play- or even just LOOK at! I mean, the characters are all so clean cut and beautifully made, and even the familiar backrounds of the courtroom, lobby, and detention center look restored and new! On top of the wonderful animation, this game offers elaborate and enthralling storylines, and though some of them border on the impossible, they never fail to entertain.However, one should be aware that there are some major changes to this game besides the change in main character. The game does include Phoenix, and some previous minor characters, all aged seven years since the last game. Maya has been pulled from the cast, and isn't even mentioned, which was a great disappointment to me, but someone immediately steps into take her role as the optimistic assistant.This game is wonderful, and i think that fans of the series should definately buy this game."
5,Perfect,came fast and in perfect conditions! thanks! :) bought it for my cousin and she says it works perfectly fine on her DS.
5,"Apollo Justice, rookie attorney","There are varying opinions of this game, considering it introduces a brand new character to the story and you don't see many previous characters. However, I still loved it. I've played all Ace Attorney games previously, so I've very familiar with them. Although Apollo himself is a boring character, mainly because it takes him forever to figure things out and most of the time Trucy gives him the answer, the overall story is interesting. Besides, who wouldn't love Trucy? She's got a certain spark.I think this game used the touch screen more often than the previous Wright games, which was nice. If you're a fan of the series, definitely pick it up. If you've never played an Ace Attorney game, I suggest you start with Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. Starting with this one would ruin some of the fun if you went back to the previous games, due to the storyline of this one."
5,amazing game xD,"This is game full of drama and excitement. Eventhough we can no longer play as our favorite character, Phoenix Wright, but this new game still doesn't lack the excitement and the fun that was contained in the first 3 games. The cases, in my opinion, is a little harder than the first three games, and it requires a lot of investigation work, but it's all worth it in the end when you finish the cases. I was so disappointed when I finished the whole game, wanting some more of this fun."
3,Almost as good,"Ace Attorney 4 is an adequate sequel to the earlier Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney games. While I recommend the earlier games wholeheartedly, the writing and characters in this installment don't quite measure up to the same standard."
5,Jazzy fun for all,"This book sparked my interest as one my husband and son would enjoy together. It has far exceeded my expectations. We all enjoy it immensely. The book definately has a jazzy tone, and it's a great story. My son loves to say that he ""spun so fast he dissapeared!"""
4,Origami Meets Fabric!,"I loved doing paper origami when I was a child and this book brought back fond memories. It is a fabulous and fun book that is very user friendly. The illustrations are detailed and colorful, the instructions are complete and easy to follow. There are a number of project ideas that are intended to inspire creativity.Another positive is the organization - there is a complete table of contents and index which is very helpful. This is definitely a must add to your wish list!"
4,fun,"fun, project. Instructions are great. though I have yet to figure how to make the sunflower look right."
4,Subtle scented hand cream,"I like this cream, but I am not crazy about it to buy it again. What I like about it is that it is not too greasy and it has a subtle scent, so my husband doesn't mind it when he has to use it when we are out and he has no access to Nivea. All in all, a decent buy."
1,Fake - Not real leather!,Synthetic Leather Looking Belt - fell apart after first use.Don't buy this!!!!
2,Brown Belt BEWARE OF SIZING,"beware of sizing... i ordered a brown medium because i am a size 9 pants... it wouldn't even fit around my waist. i ordered a white one also and i got a large and even thoguht it fits it could stand to be bigger to look less awkward. if you are more than average size, i would steer clear... otherwise, for the money, it's a good belt... i wear it often."
3,Fell apart,"This belt looks great, but a couple months after the purchase it fell apart. The lining came away from the leather of the belt."
3,Bon produit mais!!!,"Bon produit, bon service, mais une une ceinture ""made in China"", où sa vas arrté tout sa"
1,Cheap rubbish,Don't bother.Feels like it's made of some plastic material (though I'm sure it's not). Just looks cheap.I ended up buying a vintage leather belt which was much nicer.
1,not full-grain leather,"This belt is 2 layers of top-grain stitched on the edges. It may be laminated too; however, the leather was very dry and the layers were not stuck together.For a very small, thin person, this belt would look nice and allow the use of your own buckle.For any larger person, this belt would stretch, tear, and fail because it is not full-grain leather.Full-Grain means it's one, thick piece of leather.Top-Grain means they use a slicer to split the sheets of leather into thinner sheats.Top-Grain is common because it's often the ""waste"" leather used when making large sheets of uniform thickness. Laminating two layers of top-grain together does not give you any level of shear strength between the two layers."
1,Garbage (Basura),"Cheap, not real solid leather, size is wrong, shipping a rip-off, supplier does not respond"
4,Get what ya pay for..,"I can't believe all the negative reviews there are for this belt. I am aware that it isn't top notch quality, but did you look at the price and think ""THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST BELT EVER!""?The belt is decent quality, and for the price I could purchase 20 of these and still pay less then what i'd pay for a belt brand new at a department store. Also, i've been trying to find a brown belt with snaps on the back for interchangable buckles for 6 months and this is the first I found that wasn't insanely priced. I would and probably will buy more of these just to have around for the future. If one breaks, big deal I spent under $1 for it."
2,You get what you pay for...,Great price but poor quality. Does not seem to be made entirely of leather. I added a hole to the belt and the inside seems to have cardboard or some other composite material inside. I have had similar belts and the eventually de-laminate. But it was really inexpensive.
3,You get what you pay for,This had incredibly fast shipping! It smells like leather but it does look a bit cheap and i ordered a brown but the brown looks more black so its not really what I was hoping for. Its still a reasonable price.
3,Brown Belt,"I loved the price of this product. Very good deal! I bought this for my husband, we'd been unable to find a brown belt that was appropriate to put a buckle on. The only problem I had with this item is that one of the grommets that keeps the buckle part of the belt secured had popped out, making the belt unusable until we had it repaired. I've ordered several belts from Amazon, and this was the first time we had a problem with one."
2,Spend More and get a better one,I should have bought a better one. You get what you pay for. Said it came with free buckle but it didn't. Avoid unless you want a really cheap belt.
2,"Basic Belt, Strong Smell","This Beltmasters Brown Leather Belt is fairly low quality and has a very strong chemical smell that persists even after letting it air out.The sizing was accurate and the snaps are strong enough to hold my rather large metal buckle, but will look for another alternative the next time I need a belt.CFH"
1,Belt buckle,My mother always told me you get what you pay for I bought this belt and buckle because I thought it was a great deal but upon receiving it my husband tried on the belt and the buckle imidiately bent due to the quality and the texture of the belt was just way to flimsy it will be a nice belt for special event but as far as hard work I wouldn't recommend this belt
2,it came out orange,i ordered for a brown belt and when i got it turned out to be orange making me a little frustrated.
2,WHAT CAN I SAY,I give this only two stars. WHY? I paid $7.35 for each kladder toy; I bought 6. My African Grey loves them. Nothing wrong with the quality or shipment - let me be clear on that. What is wrong is that a couple of weeks ago I went on Amazon to look for more of the same toy and the SELLER RAISED THE PRICE FROM $7.35 to $11.95. Very sad. I bought the same toy from Dr. Fosters for $6.99. I will never buy from this seller again. It is clear to me that Amazon does not monitor their sellers. From $7.35 to $11.95 in 3 months- REALLY? No thanks
1,Buyer Beware,I give this toy zero stars. It needs to be recalled. At least for Macaws. My Macaw just hung himself in it. Luckily we were right here to catch him before he broke his neck. I would not recommend the largest size for large parrots. Maytbe smallest size as a chew toy. The large size would be better for small birds.
3,"THE TOOTH FAIRY, SHE COMETH","This recording is neither good or bad. It just is. It makes me think of the Tooth Fairy. By now I know there's no such thing. Subdued classical instrumental with flute player sounds OK. I like it. Not a lot. It's OK. It's kind of strange. In other words: ""Yes, No, Yes, No"". In the basic analysis, ""NO""."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS - SMC NO ONGER PROVIDES TECH SUPPPORT FOR THIS,"I have been a loyal SMC customer for years. I LOVE SMC gear, especially their tech free PHONE tech support, even of the accenst can be hard to understand.On 7/20/06, I bought 3 of these SMC7004VBR. First surprise - the default logon password is not blank! I called SMC tech support who did not have a solution (reset didn't work) and forwarded me to a pay tech support company (in India) which gave me my first call free. He didn't have th answer so I played around with the logon and SMCADMIN worked.Anyway, its a terrible business practice for a company to sell an item and 2 weeks later stop tech support.No more SMC for me."
2,This ancient device looks exactly like a switch,"The admin interface says Copyright 1998 on it, so this switch is ancient. Don't bother buying any of these.After a few days of pulling out cables from our wiring closet to discover which device on our network was issuing DHCP addresses on the rare occasions that a DHCP lease from our main server was ending and the main server was failing to respond in time, I found that we had one of these devices on our network, and after looking it up, found that it was not a switch but infact a router (does not say anywhere on the device). I promptly replaced it, stomped it to death, and hung it on my wall as a trophy. No person or device messes with my work network and gets away with it!"
4,Barricade Router,Great router did all I wanted and more. Works well with minimal set up. I would reccommend this router to anyone.
5,Very much worth buying,"Dread Beat An' Blood is a once in a lifetime record. It is not well known because its subject matter is very dark -- an explicit depiction of government supported racism and police brutality in 1970s England from the view of a person who witnessed and was subject to it. It is a miracle this record is still available.The reggae music that accompanies Linton Johnson's lyrics is some of the best that has ever been performed in the genre. I first heard this record in 1984 as a reggae DJ at a college station and today, 16 years later, the words and music are still relevant and fresh. Most overtly ""political"" music quickly gets old and outdated with time. Somehow, LKJ and his musical collaborators concocted these songs so that they have not aged with time. How they did this, I don't know, but they did it.I cannot recommend this record too highly."
4,Rated PG - Not every mystery must have a murder...,"I appreciate a mystery writer who doesn't make every mystery a murder mystery. This is a fun read about the best and worst of man's nature - a case that seems to be one person's word against anothers'. Watch how the general public reacts and form your own opinion. This sort of tale is timeless.Foul Language - None.Sex - None, overtly. Some discussion of cohabitation by an unwed man and woman as well as adultery. Appropriate for the story.Violence - Some mob violence, not graphic."
3,Missing Something?,A good read -- with an interesting plot -- but it is hard to see why this is considered one of the great mysteries of the 20th Century.
4,A great read for thriller/mystery lovers.,"I was introduced to Josephine Tey by a friend who gave me a copy of 'The Daughter of Time' which I thought was brilliant! 'The Franchise Affair' is equally so. I spent yesterday in bed reading this. I couldn't put it down until I found out that the odious Betty Kane got her just desserts. I must say that I was a little disappointed. I thought Tey could have made her suffer a little more, or at least depicted her as suffering a little more for the benefit of readers like me who detested her immensely and wanted a revenge you could taste. I was very unsatisfied with the description of her in the court room, a vision of outward calm and passivity. I wanted her raging and carrying on like a pork chop in front of all those newspaper people. But other than that, this is a fabulous book. I am going to be searching for more Josephine Tey books to enjoy on my days off."
5,One of the best mysteries from the British Classic Period,"This and, Tey's Brat Farrar, are two of the very best from the decades around WWII when British mystery writing was so good. Unlike many of the books by Dorothy Sayers, Marjorie Allingham or Ngaio Marsh, classics in their day, these two by Tey stand up well to the passage of time. The story of The Franchise Affair is timeless and the characters and local so beautifully written that the book is not dated at all. The modern reader can appreciate the difference in lifestyle in the post War time without feeling that it is too period or quaint. A fine story that is suspenseful even though the reader knows from the beginning how the tale will end."
5,Very enjoyable!,"I enjoyed this story of The Franchise Affair very much. The author does a nice job of describing the various characters and also the British setting, and the mystery is engrossing."
4,A must have for Curtis Fuller fans!,"This album took me by surprize, but it's an excelent show of what makes Curtis Fuller the master that he is. Listen to his playing on ""Seeing Red"" and ""Rock and Troll"" to hear why this album is something to pick up. (You'll need to by the album to hear what I refer to because the audio clips don't get too far into his soloing.) His ideas are simple, fun, and I haven't heard a trombonist who can play as clean as Curtis Fuller while playing so fast!If you're a trombonist this album is a must have!Fuller plays well on the whole album, but the 2 tracks mentioned above make this album somthing to get. Red Garland plays well also. By the way... Seeing Red is almost exacly the same chord changes as Charlie Parker's ""Blues for Alice"".ENJOY!!"
5,the new release by sara hendrix is her best yet,"Sara's new album entitled ""ghoststories"" is an eclectic mix of alternative rock/pop which is accessable enough for radio play but maintains more depth than the average commercial offerings. Sara's vocal performance is at once haunting and erotic without straying into the void of the angry chick pop-star."
3,warped tour 2007 HARDLY summed up here....,"I have been going to warped tour since 2005 and it is quite the experience. There is so much going on, so many wonderful people, games, contests, bands, performances, etc. etc. This DVD limits itself to a select few performances as well as interviews and some limited tour bus/backstage stuff with the bands. I feel that warped is such a huge yearly event for so many people that SOMEONE could have captured the entirety of the event more successfully. The live performances are WONDERFUL: Avenged Sevenfold, Coheed & Cambria, Bad Religion, Chiodos, each of them drawing me back into the wonderful day two years back. The DVD just let me wanting A LOT MORE and not in a good way. I've noticed that all these spectacular festivals come and go each year and we end up watching YOUTUBE videos of the them instead of getting a dvd or double dvd of each years festival....weak."
4,Simply Beautiful,This lamp is just beautiful. I bout 2 of them for behind my sofa and they make the room even more gorgeous. The quality is very good. The only problem I have is with the lamp shades not staying straight/even but it's not that big of a deal
3,Basically lame,"This is a quick, easy read, but it's generally pretty lame. The characters are extremely contrived and not very believable -- especially the rabbi. It's the Jewish fictional equivalent of a chick lit beach book with a dash of spiritual modern Judaism peppered in."
1,This doesn't deserve any stars,This book is just plain awful. There's no way of getting around it. It's just bad writing- plain and simple. Save your money and your time.
3,"Despite the other reviews,","this is actually a rather decent first novel for Aaron Hamburger. Although the figure of the ill father isn't developed as fully as I would have liked to see and there were some odd devices thrown in (such as the father/husband appearing as a ghost when he isn't dead, etc). This was a pretty clever book in that we get to look at several different people's search for meaning and transcendence from typically boring and superficial lives. Faith for Beginners isn't meant to be wholesome or completely satisfying, it's meant to highlight the bitter and confusing struggle of people finding their places (or inability to find a place) in the modern world. Oh, and the sex scenes that previous reviewers have complained about really aren't particularly graphic. However, I wouldn't recommend reading this for a church or otherwise religious discussion group"
3,Where's Stephen?,"Lots of Thurston, Mike Watt & Lee Renaldo, some David Yow, only one entry from Courtney and none from Stephen Malkmus, so the title is a little misleading. If you're a Beck fan, you'll love his entries. They're the best of the bunch. He describes the world as he sees it in Beck-style free-form, without bashing his fellow performers. Thurston's entries are almost entirely in strangely self-righteous defense of Kathleen Hanna and an incident in which he was not even involved, which is a waste. The last I heard, Kathleen is more than capable of speaking for herself so his defense of her/bashing of Courtney is unnecessary. I expected and would have preferred more insight into the Lollapalooza performing experience."
3,It would've been more objective had she been single...,"I do agree that it was silly of her to go undercover in the dating scene when she was married and could only go so far in her research. However, I did find the book hilarious. Whether hearing about nutcase dating coaches like ""Rhonda,"" and silly seminars on flirting, it cracked me up. It was disappointing that the book made people who needed help in dating come off as ""losers"" for partaking in these methods...the book would've been better if it focused more on the pros and cons of these methods as opposed to just knocking them all."
5,A great read,"Stacy Kravetz has done a fine job of keeping me entertained, which I believe were her intentions. I did not pick this book up believing it was a ""how to"" guide, and it is not. Rather, it is an insider's perspective of the modern trial and tribulations of dating. I laughed out loud on several occasions, thought 'wow' at certain points, and overall truly enjoyed this quick read. My hat's off to the author for putting together a fine piece of work."
1,HAVEN'T READ IT YET!,"Be careful what edition you receive.I received the book without the Illustrations by Maurice Spira. (Huge fan of the artist Maurice Spira, hence the importance of that edition)Sent it back, twice. Was told I'd be getting a refund.Got nothing. Amazon's not responding.Hope you enjoy."
3,I don't like poems but my neuro doc says I need to read them,"I was told to get a book of poems, I just happened to pick this one, not into poems they are boring. My neuro doc to get one and read them aloud, I still have not finished reading this book ugh!!"
3,wonderful material -- terrible formatting,"If you can get past the horrible formatting and the way the words all jumble together, it is a great collection of one of the greatest writers ever. I just wish it was easier to navigate."
5,Bad Luck,"I was unfortunate enough to hear this CD before other potentially good hardcore bands. As a result, all hardcore bands I hear must measure-up to Will Haven's greatness. The band's debut album begins with some strange noises which give the echo effects of standing in a concrete room and eventually lead into the heavy guitar of ""Stick Up Kid,"" which is immediately followed by two of Will Haven's best songs, ""I've Seen My Fate"" and ""Ego's Game."" The result is that Will Haven is found to play in a tone very different from other bands. Instead of an album that is fast-paced from beginning to end, Will Haven gives us an album that is actually much slower than is to be expected, but every song on the CD is as heavy as ever. Will Haven offers the listener a sound that is so different from anything else, it is almost an acquired taste, even to the seasoned metal fan. However, once this taste is found, Will Haven proves to be a great amongst greats."
5,A Little goes a Long Way!,These delicate earrings are a lovely addition to other pieces from the Peora London Blue Topaz collection. We added these earrings to a ring and necklace to create a beautiful set for our daughter; whose birthday is in December.She is as delighted with the quality and craftsmanship of the earrings as we are. They look lovely on the ear; especially if one's hair is short or worn swept away from the ear. The earrings are the perfect size for looking elegant. We are most pleased with our purchase!
3,Neath Arizona Skies dvd,"All prints of this film which I have viewed are in rough shape. Synergy print is better than some , but for watching (contrast/ sound) I prefer the print issued by Platinum / Echo Bridge offered as a buy one - get one free."
3,two good 1934 westerns,"The pattern of children being a main part of the plot inboth these movies plays to the fact that ""B"" western like theseshowed on Saturdays to kids across America.The sound on the second movie was pretty bad on the tape I saw.Cattle rustling at night is a pretty stupid plot elementin that movie ( something like the 10 shot six shooter sometimes seen in this era movieor the lead slinging shooting style no sane cowboy would use).I liked seeing these movies one more time..."
1,noll peered at his inner self and didnt like what he saw,"The lid has been opened in the ""Zaius"" interview. There stands the ""scholar"" in full disclosure, bitter, arrogant, dismissive, full of expletives, and uncontrolled anger at the junguians. "" I get no respect!"" he whines again and again. He classifies his early admiration for Junguian thought, as ""I was in my twenties and fool"". Well, how's that for self disclosure! On the same interview, he argues that ""they shouldnt be looking at my motives!"". How Noll-ian!"
5,stunning intellectual achievement,"Finally, an intellectually honest critique of Jung and the profit minded industry of Jungist analysis that he inspired...this book is great. Wish I had read it before I started Jungist analysis, it would have helped me separate the benfits of the experience from the real looniness a whole lot quicker, but better late than never."
1,Noll's bias is too obvious!,I would hate for Richard Noll to go through my library. It's as if Jung embraced every idea of any subject he read about. Can't you search without be branded as a disciple of this or that cult?
1,"Again, the little men stomp greatness into the ground...","I lost my faith in reason long ago, when I watched how objective reasoning could be used to pound any opinion or idea into the dirt. Reading this dry, deconstructionist rant once again proved Wilhelm Reich (another similiarly persecuted psychologist) correct- little men will always reject ideas which they fear and misunderstand, by attempting anything in their power to disprove the conflicting idea or defame the conflicting individual. Instead of reading this garbage, I would suggest trying to reconstruct your subjective mind- Friedrich Nietzsche, Ken Wilber, Aleister Crowley, Wilhelm Reich, Timothy Leary, Terrence McKenna, Michel Foucault, or even <snicker> Carl Jung could help you ""expand your head"" beyond the inculcated ideas of our society."
4,A hatchet job but has some value.,"Much of this book is about Pan-German volkisch groups,Nietzscheanism,neo-paganism and sun worship in Germany and kindredsubjects,all of which are claimed to be influences on Jung, but specific links are not made clear.Jung's actual ideas and teachings are barely touched upon.Significant points made are that the Solar Phallus Man account by Jung is very dubious;Jung had an experience of self deification; and the Jung movement has certain cult like features.This book adds to our knowledge of Jung, about whom much has still to be learnt."
1,Propaganda & tired pseudoiconoclasm,"Some people will do anything for a little propaganda. A book like this could just as easily have been written about Socrates, Rabelais, Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Joyce, or a lot of other people. Whenever a revolutionary new thinker comes along, the irrelevant, talentless pseudoiconoclasts (e.g. Richard Noll) come along to take them to pieces. Spare me yet another hyped-up 'j'accuse!'. Yes, I did read it and take note of it, and the facts are selectively chosen and selectively interpreted. A waste of money, and deceptive & vindictive too. Burn this."
4,Highly recommended,"""The Jung Cult"" by Richard Noll is well-researched, precise, and readable. It gives penetrating insights into the mind of one of the most influential thinkers in recent history.Highly recommended for those with an interest in psychology."
5,Read this book before going into 'Jungian analysis',"This book is brilliant, and so is Noll's next one (""The Aryan Christ""). ""The Jung Cult"" reveals Jungian/Jungist 'analysis' as a cynical sophisticated pyramid system through which a small group of initiates tries to sell the sacred or to convince people to pay through the nose, usually for years, for a pseudo-religious experience.""The Jung Cult"" is not just ranting and raving, either. The author presents a large amount of historical data to argue that Carl Jung wanted it this way when he set up this closed secret society. No wonder it can never fit in to the main psychiatric and psychological organizations in Europe and the U.S. If you want a fascinating study of a very shadowy organization, and sound historical data to back it up, give this book a read, and do it before you plunk down any bucks to people who have less science and less training than snake oil salesmen, though probably twice the ambition and a better billing system."
2,A boring book to read,"I find this book boring and confusing.It presents too much details,and they are predetermined.The author igored some important aspects:the works and articles by Jung himself,the statues of other important psychoanalysts,etc.The author claimed to present us the ""historical Jung"",but I got little idea from it.I wish I hadn't read it."
2,Not the Best of the West,"I bought this disc because of the personnel - Shank, Shorty Rogers, Jimmy Rowles, Levy and Larry Bunker. All of whom I have enjoyed immensely on other West Coast jazz sessions. But this recording - essentially two LPs, one by Shank with Rogers in tow and one by Levy's trio - is what I would call a lesser session. It lacks any kind of cohesion on either date. I expected those tight swinging clever charts with cool harmonies and a hint of Basie that these guys were so famous for. But not on this one. These are some recordings seeking an identity, seeking an audience and most of all, they don't swing. Pass on this one unless you're trying to complete your West Coast collection."
4,Usefull for the Novice,"You can find most of this information on the web if you look for it and as the book mentions it too you will need an attorney to draw up the lease and they can help give you all this information too.However this book puts most of the information into one place and gives you a starting point and the basic information you need to know. As that it was worth reading it. Its an easy read and can be done in one sitting. Would also be a good reference for later. I'd say if you can buy it used for under $10 its a good value, this will be the least expensive part of your leasing process."
1,Don't Waste your Money,"This book is too general to serve any real user of office space. You would be better off educating yourself on the market and how to negotiate effectively through free web sites such as Pikenet, and Starboardnet.com."
1,"Beautiful Clock, No Bells","This is a beautiful clock. The workmanship is superb, and it keeps perfect time. But one buys a ship's bell clock expecting to ...hear the ship's bells! The bells on this clock are tinny, dull and cannot be heard at all more than two feet away. I returned my first one thinking it was broken, but the second clock was no better. I contacted the manufacturer and was told that ""some people like softer bells."" I returned the second clock too. I went on line seeking other reviews and found that every review noted that the bells were unsatisfactory. Sad."
4,Bells could be louder,"It's a beautiful clock, and it's the right size for my office. But, everyone was right, the bells are just a bit too muted. Unless it is very quiet in my office, the bells cannot be heard. Otherwise, I really like the clock."
4,Great TEACHINGS!,"I didn't know this was going to be storybook type cartoon. I thought it was going to be animated, that's why I gave it a 4 star. The story lines were great and helped explain the fruits of the spirits on my 6 and 8 year old level. I could really tell that my 8 year old would had rather this been animated. As well as myself because I love cartoons that have an Christian meaning! Thanks for shipping to APO!!!"
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"I've played in the past but had been quite awhile, this product is excellent. Takes you step by step but quickly progresses. Really like the application, can play along, show's you cords (or hides them - your choice), records, etc.I plan on buying the intermediate level once I've completed the beginners"
5,YOU Will play the Guitar!,I had been wanting to take guitar lessons but did not have the time.After doing some research I purchased eMedia's Guitar Method.I loaded up the software and began my first lesson.Within an hours time I was playing a song!I could not beleive it.I have never had a lessons nor could I understand a note.There are some really good features like a built in tuner and animated fretboard(my fav).I highly recommend the product.It's like personal lesson in your home!
2,"Good, but slightly over-hyped!!","I bought this CD title b/c I wanted to learn how to play the guitar again. My decision to purchase this was based solely on all the Amazon reviews that I perused beforehand. You can definitely learn to play the guitar with this, but there are so many other titles out there that are cheaper and more up-to-date. Furthermore, there is nothing more annoying to me than hearing the instructor loudly singing the songs over the guitar strumming. His voice dominants in many parts of the lessons, and it deafens the sound of the guitar which makes it very difficult to hear the chords being taught. Again, the software is good but may not be the best on the market. Then again, I've only purchased three titles, and this one offers a few things that the others don't include."
4,Do we read too much?,"Thank you Mr Thompson; you have provided delight to a 45 year old child. Your book makes me wonder ... ""Do I read too much?"" Maybe I should choose what I read with more care."
1,Memory upgrade,We bought these to upgrade a couple of older Dell computers... waste of money. The computers would not address the memory and caused nothing but grief!
1,Did not perform for me,"I bought Corsair memory for my personal desktop to increase memory from 1.5gb to 2.0 gb. A friend, who works in the IT field, told me that all chips are produced by the same manufacturer, and thus, I should by the least expensive, which happened to be Corsair. Although my system booted after the installation, I saw little improvement in speed. However, the real problem was that my system would freeze - constantly - in any and all of my programs. Then it became an even bigger problem. My system began shutting down and restarting on its own while I was in the midst of doing work. As soon as I replaced the Corsair memory with the original, all problems ceased. I then returned the Corsair and and ordered PNY."
1,cheap product,"I have been an amazon customer for a while and this is the first time I was unhappy with a product. This RAM caused internal problems with my PC, the repair guy said he had seen this several times with the Corsair brand RAM and recommended Kingston brand. Be careful"
5,Excellent Product,"I have built many computers and have tried other brands of memory. I have always beenvery satisfied with Corsair Memory. It's fast, reliable, and just install and run.I know there are other products out there equivalent or better, but I would recommendCorsair very highly."
4,So long dear microwave...,"Since my cooking skills are somewhat lacking (anything that doesn't include microwave directions used to baffle me) I received a crockpot and this book as a much needed gift. I found Crockery Cookery to be a great guide for those of us who don't have the time (or in my case the experience) to follow complex recipes.Since getting this cookbook, I find that even I can make really great food with a minimum of prep time and ingredients. Plus, its nearly impossible to overcook food in a crockpot. In fact, now I go days without using my microwave for dinner (and if that isn't enough endorsement than I don't know what is). Overall, a fine cookbook. And be sure to try the Napa Cabbage with Kielbasa...."
1,Too much trouble,"I read the reviews of Mabel Hoffman's cookbooks and bought them on the strength of those reviews. I'm sorry I did.I use a crockpot to make my life simpler. Ms. Hoffman's recipes usually require either cheesecloth, a crockpot trivet, or both. Sometimes, you have to prepare the food before placing in the crockpot. The food may be marvelous, but as a working woman, I'm not going to do all these things.I believe I copied out 3-5 recipes per each book of Ms. Hoffman's that I bought. If you enjoy fussy crockpot cooking, these may be the books for you."
2,You Will Learn Basic Crockpot Skills,"Hoffman's recipes sound delicious, but in fact are often flavorless. If you use her recipes, you WILL learn slow cooking tecniques (stacking meat in the pot, thickening sauces, etc). But after 7 years of using this book, my notes on the recipes have a continual refrain: ""Needs more pizzaz""; ""Add vegetables""; ""Flavors need more depth""."
3,Crockery Cookery,Was somewhat disappointed in this book. I had ordered it to replace one I previously had and it has been revised. Several of the recipes that were in it before are now gone. I also don't remember the print being so small.
3,IT'S OKAY,"I have tried a couple of recipes out of this book and the spaghetti meat sauce was excellent. However, the layout of the book itself is terrible. It's a paperback book and I prefer cookbooks that will stay open on the counter such as spiral bound. I also like slick, glossy pages in cookbooks as they stay cleaner. It really bothers me that the size of crockpot needed for each recipe is not stated. Some cookbooks state which sizes are necessary. I just have to figure it out based on the number of servings, but I wish it were stated in the recipe. The center of this edition has some color pictures that are on glossy pages, but they are staring to fall out of the book. The book is not very well-made.Of all my slow cooker cookbooks, this is the one that basically gathers dust on the shelf."
3,Wonderful flavors ... for the weekends.,"My mom had this book, and every recipe I make from it has that nostalgic taste of home. I especially love the breads and beverages -- things that other slow-cooker books leave out.However, I find myself using these recipes mostly for weekend entertaining rather than on work nights. A substantial number of these dishes aren't designed for the dump-it-in-and-run-to-work crowd; they require six hours on low heat or the addition of extra ingredients halfway through the cooking time.Devoted cooks looking for tasty long-simmered flavors will be delighted, but there just aren't enough dishes here that can be made on the working-family schedule for me to give this the rating that the flavors deserve."
2,Very Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with the recipes in this book. I love to cook, love to try new recipes, and bought this book on the strength of others' reviews. I've tried 6 recipes straight out of the book with no adaptation. 2 of them were OK, but had little flavor. The other 4 were barely edible, with strange flavors. Another reviewer said this book is a good spring-board for crockery cooking. I would definately say that you need to be experienced enough with the crock pot, and spice usage in general, to adapt these recipes to taste, in order to enjoy recipes from this book."
3,Mass Market Version Too Small,"If you order the Mass Market Paperback version of this book, keep in mind that it is the size of a small novel and pages are 'dark' (recycled) paper -- not very efficient in the kitchen. I only looked through the book briefly before returning it for the above reason. Recipes looked good, but probably not for the quick-fix, ingredients-on-hand meal."
2,Not happy to give as a gift,"Old looking and feeling, and no pictures! Small, doesn't stay open forcooking purposes. The recipes may be ""the best"" but I just didn't like it,and didn't feel like giving it as a gift."
2,Not what I thought I was getting,"I owned this book several years ago and, unfortunately, it ""disappeared"" from my bookshelf. I thought I was replacing that book, but this does not have the same recipes in it. Wish I could get the original one again."
2,A little worn,"Book was a little worn, even fell open at what must have been favorite recepies, so I guess that is useful."
3,So-so,This book was referenced in another frugal budgeting book. I did not find many recipes that were to my liking. This may be completely suitable for someone else.
5,Outstanding Book,"If I were going to have only ONE crockery cookbook, THIS would be it! Well written recipes and a marvelous variety of dishes. Outstanding!"
4,I like it.,"This is my 4th pair, of this style. On the steel toe version, the leather rubs off the toe real fast. But the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of weeks for my big toes to get comfortable, because the front sole is as hard as the heel part. Otherwise these are broke in the first day for me."
4,Nice looking,very nice looking boot but they run narrow. the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me.
5,Great Boot!,Boot provides excellent foot support. Light weight and flexible. No break in time required. Boots wear great right out of the box!
2,Durashocks Boots,"I love ordering from Amazon. They process and deliver my orders in a timely manner. However, I am very disappointed with the Wolverine work boots.The quality of construction has changed; along with the sizing and they hurt my feet. My first pair of Wolverine work boots were so comfortable that I would take long walks in them. I expected all Wolverine Durashock work boots to be of the same quality and comfort; they're not. If you're looking for comfort, avoid these boots"
5,An excellent cartoon...for all ages!,"Over here in England Corneil & Bernie was called Watch my chops. Why the name was changed i dont know but when 13 episodes were released back in 2003 (i think) i got it straight away!Last year i was puzzled why no more episodes were released and it was only when i looked it up on wiki that i found out the programs title had been changed,then i found out that all 52 episodes had been released on 2 discs!!Eeeek!!!52 episodes? Great googally moogally!This cartoon is without doubt one of the funniest ive ever seen.Its a simple premise-Corneil is a talking and very intelligent dog & Bernie is his dogsitter & the only one who knows his secret!As i said before,there are 52 episodes & they'll keep you busy for hours & the great thing about this cartoon? Its for adults aswell as kids!So do yourself a favour and buy this,you wont regret it ;)"
4,This CD is awesome but it is so short!,"I just got this CD yesterday in the mail and I am very satisfied with it. Great ""emo"" hardcore band. The rhythm playing is very moving and creative. It doesn't get that repetitive either. Very strong lyrics too. The only problem is that the CD is just too short! The CD is 34 minutes long but if you take out the big blank space in between the secret track there's about 28 minutes of music. Still well worth it though. And guitar solos would have been nice too!"
1,sonic vomit,this is not music but horrible whiny noise. how about trying to find a singer that can actually sing. I cannot think of anymore words to describe how bad this sucks so I'm going to stop trying. peace out homeys.
5,"Awesome CD, Amazon got the title a bit wrong, though...","It's ""Hope"", not Hop. Anyways, my favorite hardcore band. Melodic hardcore music with amazing screamed vocals. Too bad the singer and the drummer left the band."
5,The best film ever made,"Robert De Niro the finest actor in the world at the peak of his powers giving an astounding performance as the self destructive, suspicious, stubborn and angry Jake Le Motta would be reason enough to behold this film. Yet, Raging Bull contains so much more, the crisp black and white photography inturrupted by brief projector images of coulor that are extremely poignant , as we watch La Motta's seemingly happy home movies while knowing all along the path his life is taking. In another great performance in the movie, Joe Pesci hits the right notes as Jake's brother who is too weak to stand up to him. He takes his frustrations out on his wife and his friends, and eventually abandons his abusive brother in the film final harsh,fair and heartbreaking third. This director Martin Scorsese's masterpiece which criminally lost the best piture oscar to the much lesser Oridinary People. To all of you who haven't seen this film, do yourself a favour and see it."
3,Good acting /Bad quality control,"The acting and the photography of the fight sequences are quite good. The problem lies in the quality of the DVD itself. The first copy I received was not playable and was returned. The second copy played ok, but the contrasts in volume between the conversation parts and the fight sequences were extreme. One could hadly hear the conversation portions and had to turn the volume up near its maximum. When the fight sequences occurred, the volume had to be turned back down. This soon became annoying. I am surprised that the anniversary edition had these problems.The special features disk was trouble-free and well worth watching."
5,True Classic,I am a 12 year old movie freak and I have to say that this movie is and Goodfellas are by far the best Robert DeNiro and Martin Scorese Film of ever. This is a true classic and everyone should watch it. Based on the true story of Jake LaMotta
2,"I flatter myself I know something about movies, but.....","I cannot for the life of me understand the glowing praise about this movie. Is it a bad movie? No. It's just nothing special. Scorsese's technique is, if anything, showy. De Niro and Pesci are wonderful actors, there's no denying that. But the movie as a whole just isn't particularly good. I can find nothing about this movie that would bring it even close to the accolades it has been given. Believe me, I wanted to like this movie. I thought it would be great and then some; equal to the Searchers or 2001, from the praise it got; but it was uninteresting. It was like the type of movie arthouse theaters show that is competently made but lifeless and boring, like Shine. I'm sorry. Call me an idiot. I did not like this movie."
3,Any decent movies for families to watch ...?,Good movie ... unfortunately one of the many good movies brought to screen by hollywood but ruined with a script brimming with obscenities & filthy language. Makes you sick - very annoying why a good story cannot be told in a manner that will allow you to enjoy it with kids & the entire family. Now that requires a rare talent that big name hollywood directors are yet to master. I may be wrong but to the best of my knowledge such obscenties & language would not be permitted in most american homes. But maybe it is for film folks from Hollywood where broken marriages and dysfunctional familes are the norm.Good Movie but I cannot allow such filth into my home ...
2,A story not worth telling.,"Maybe its my lifelong aversion to horror movies but this is 2+ hours of distilled unpleasantness. Anyone who has ever lived in NY or NJ knows guys like this, but so what.The one thing that might have redeemed Raging Bull would be if there was any light at all on why he was the way he was. And if that's too much to ask, I'd settle for why anybody would make a movie about him.In the end its really just a brilliant portrayal of an angry lowlife."
1,"Overrated, dull, and unpleasant.","I saw this movie in my film studies class. At first I thought, ""Boxing movie? Cool!"" but only a few minutes into the film I discovered that it was miles away from exciting. Jake La Motta is an extremely unsympathetic character whose temper and jealousy don't give any motivation for the audience to like him. He alienates everyone close to him and I couldn't bring myself to feel sorry for his eventual fate. Robert De Niro's portrayal of La Motta was well done, but being well-acted doesn't make the film any more watchable. The boxing scenes were the parts I was most looking forward to, but again, I was sorely disappointed. I am well aware that the boxing wasn't the main focus of this film, but a director of Scorsese's caliber should have been able to make it slightly interesting.The only thing that angers me more than the fact that my time was wasted by this film is the fact that so many hail it as a masterpiece."
1,Ragin Bull Rating,"I love De Niro movies typically.....that smile of his, his acting potential, which cann go from extreme insanity to totally hilarious actor but this movie, De Niro or not De Niro, my son and I rated a ""negative one-halve"".Every movie my son and I watch, we rate them after as a family thing, if you will, from 1 to 10...............we rated this movie negative one-halve. The acting was when they were young and little was demanded from him nor demonstrated. Everyone in the show talked and walked the IQ of about 65. I guess what I am trying to say is it was very very shallow storyline and the actors showed little to no depth.Bob :o)"
3,would be 4 stars-edited,"this was a fine film back in 1980 in its original form.Like many fine dramas of that era it has since fallen victim to politically correct censorship, which is done to gut the films of realism and power.La mottas racial attitudes and taunting have been removed, along with racial street talkof other Italian American characters of the time and place that render the film far less autentic than the original cut. This kind of thing has been done to many films of the past. It appeared tobegin Post Reagan and is now worse than ever.can't recommend censored art work-we already saw the original cuts."
5,Boxing's classic,"As the story potraited about a washed up boxer named Jake La Motta. My main fasination about the movie was how the movie was choreographed. Great in-ring battling scenes, with such brutality, Scorsese's truly has a gift of filming making. The story is also what captures your attention, as it shows the harsh realities and the pressures of the day and life of a professional boxer. Truly one of DeNiro's finest work along with a great support by Joe Pesci playing DeNiro's brother."
5,I heard things...,"I heard things, Joey...I heard things....I heard that this is a great movie!!! Wow!!! The fights are incredibly provocative, DeNiro is a God in this movie, Pesci is hysterically funny as usual, and Martin Scorsese has once again made a movie masterpiece of raw power and incredible story telling! A MUST BUY!!!"
4,"""I COUL'VE BEEN A CONTENDER""","I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE AS A TEENAGER N IT LEFT A LASTING IMPRESSION ON ME: FOR STARTERS IT INTRODUCED ME TO GREAT FILMAKING; IT ALSO SET TH STANDARD AS TO HOW I PERCIEVE MOVIES(DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?) ..I DO REMEMBER NOT LIKING TH END OR THINKING IT WAS TOO LONG. SO, I SAW IT AGAIN YEARS LATER N WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED(BOTH WITH TH END ING N MYSELF) ..TH SARDONIC UNDERTONE: ""I COUL'VE BEEN A CONTENDER"" TH IMPLICATIONS ARE HILARIOUS!"
3,this movie is the definition of great sport flicks,"this movie was great plot wise, and scorsese did an excellent job of adapting the life of prizefighter jake la mata into a movie"
2,I did like the special feature disk,"Deniro is one of the best actors of all time. Most all of Scorcese's films are jewels. But...I couldn't get through this film in one sitting. An overdose. The script seemed ad-libed and overfull. It was boring. It was depressing from start to finish with no sense of salvation for any of the characters, nor did they deserve it.I bought the special edition and absolutely enjoyed the special features, though it won't drive me back to watch the film again.""Mean Streets"" and ""Taxi Driver"" did the same thing to me,,so perhaps I'm peculiar."
3,raging bull,"robert deniro is my number 2 favorite actor.(clint eastwood the 1st) i was very dissapointed in this film because of the quality of the sounds and conversations. the first time i watched it i could not even make out most of what was being said. the second time i watched it with subtitles and this time it was much better. the accents of the characters was very hard for me to follow. the great part of the movie was visually. the fight scenes were great. i honestly believed deniro was boxing for real. the editing was flawless. i don't know for sure if he won an oscar for this movie, but if he did not he deserved it!"
5,It hits you hard,"Poor Jake . You actually fell sorry the man who mistrerats everyone who helped him . Robert de Niro again is so convincing that he makes something unacceptable to be a strong , amazing performance . How can this not have won best picture or best director ?"
5,Black and White Masterpiece,"Meticulous attention to detail and proper use of black and white photography gives this story of the self-destructive life of pro-boxer Jake LaMotta extra-added emphasis.Footnote: When interviewed, the real Jake LaMotta said the movies's depiction of his life was inaccurate - the movie wasn't violent enough!!!!He did not elaborate, and no one wanted him too.Can you blame them?"
2,Where is our Special Edition?,"While this movie is a true classic and is one of Scorsese's best, that can't be said for the far unacceptable DVD that is now out of print. A Special Edition w/ and Anamorphic transfer would help, but it can't come soon enough. Since the previous DVD has been out of print for quite some time, I assume a Special Edition is in the works and I expect an Anamorphic transfer. If not, I'm sure there will be more than one angry film buff.The movie is flawless as you see Jake LaMotta's soul and career being torn apart by himself through an amazing performance from Robert De Niro. A performance that I would say is the best of all-time. With the help of Jake LaMotta himself, Martin Scorsese has delievered a movie with awesome black and white cinematography, great boxing visuals (some of the most powerful you'll see in film) and top-notch performances from the entire cast. A must-see film!"
5,Why is this out of print!????,"One of the greatest movies ever made is no longer available on DVD. Hopefully it will be re-released sometime soon, but I have heard no future release dates."
5,a knock out classic,one of the greatest films of all-time.it's time less.for fans of boxing it's striped down unconventinal and very street with ordinary folks with ordinary issues.that's what makes this film so mind blowing.it acts the way it was meant to be made.no compromises.
5,This film will knock you out !!!,"Raging Bull is the film based on the autobiography by formermiddle-weight champion Jake La Motta. Jake La Motta is a visiousfighter who was renowned for his powerful punches, which gave him the name ""The Raging Bull"". He is also a very jealous man who often assumes that his wife is having affaires with several men. This makes him an angry violent man which costs him the love of his wife and his brother. Robert De Niro plays the part of La Motta with sheer excellence and Joe Pesci as his brother is just as good.This is simply one of the best films money can buy. Get it and watch it again and again. A KNOCK OUT."
5,Amazing & awe inspiring,"every one i speak to about movies has said that raging bull is an awsome movie . It is haunting and brilliant , there's no way some one can hate this movie . Even those no interested in boxing . Bob deserved the award , so did Marty , but .... who knows ? I refused to see the movie that beat it for best picture ."
3,Pretty Good,"I really enjoyed this book; the imagery is concise and the syntactical structure terse and uninformative, verging on obscure. However, was it really necessary to spend so long describing the 'Swallow's Testicle' of the title, and in such detail? As a 54 year old heterosexual, I have difficulty relating to such metaphors, but other than that, this book is a fine read."
4,"Good, but could be better","I really wanted a more thorough dictionary of London place names. I found this to be a little too sparse in points. However, it is a useful guide for anyone who wants to understand how London is laid out geographically, as well as understand the origination of place names."
5,Georges Perec,...will deconstruct Apartment of people and artefacts to use skeleton as guide in abridgement. Placing selectedcharacters from (French) Georges Perec novel based on 10x10 magic square apt. building.
3,Newspaper quality,"Once up, the mural is nice enough; however, the quality of the paper is like newspaper instead of wallpaper and it is very difficult to work with. The paper rips and tears easily once you apply paste. Additionally, once you start hanging you find that matching your buildings is virtually impossible. You will be able to match bits and pieces, but ultimately if you can match one the rest will not match perfectly. Thankfully, since it is so large, it is hard to tell where there is a mismatch unless you were the one who hung it originally. The price was more affordable than any other Vegas mural I could find, but it did come with a ""cost"" of its own by not being high quality or easy to apply."
5,Nice,"Great shorts, have had them over a year. No problems, no snags, not coming apart. Good buy, except they keep sending their stupid catalog now that they got my address."
4,"Not the best, but definatly worth buying.","I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan, and a beginning French student. Because of that I did not comprehend every word, but it was lots of fun to see how things were changed when put into French (Draco Malfoy became Drago Malefoy), and know exactly what is happening. I was dissapointed that many parts were unnecessarily cut out. Some I noted were the confronation when Harry, Ron and Hermione are under the invisiblity cloak while going to the trapdoor, and Mrs. Weasley first telling Harry how to get on to platforn nine and three-quarters. I recommend this book to all French students as a fun way to study French, and I learned a ton of new words."
3,"""Feather fill uses only white goose down"" NOT!","I bought it because the product description says ""Feather fill uses only white goose down"". The comforter is actually 95% feathers and only 5% goose down. The feathers crackle alot when the comforter moves. After its been shaken a couple of times, the thickness is about 3/4 inch which is just right for me. Yes, I live in the Arizona desert. I still think its a good deal for $20."
3,Could be softer,"The comforter looks very pretty, but it feels like paper and it makes a crackling noise. Since it says it is machine washableI am going to try to see if washing will stop the noise."
2,It's an OK comforter,"Like the other reviews it is very lightweight, definately not for winter here in oregon. But it is working alright with the duvet cover we bought. Bad note: The feather shafts are stiff and stick in some of the corners this seems to be causing the comforter to shift all the way to the bottom of my duvet cover. Have to readjust in the morning. But for the price....oh well."
5,Great Results - Super Fitness and Stress Reducer,I incorporated the Coach's principles into a workout initially geared toward reducing stress from my career as a health care professional. I had no idea of the fitness and stamina I would develop and the weight loss I am experiencing. This book explains the complexities of boxing in an easy to understand manner. Great Book!
5,"Very, very funny.","First of King's books I read, and the best so far in my opinion. Straightforward, down-to-earth, bawdy and very funny. Almost like a mate telling you stories down the pub - only more interesting, and oddly enough, more believable.Tells the story of a guy working as sub-editor at a soft porn mag. Not plot driven, the strength is in the story-telling, the humour and frankness of what is basically a series of vignettes. Excellent book."
4,Jane Grooves,"Crazy Jane is/was the now disbanded Charleston, WV band fronted by Karen Allen. A mix of alternative folk acoustics and funky jazz, their music ranges from mellow to screaming.Their self-titled second album does not hold the same shaking fire as their out-of-print debut, Choice Oranges, but it still holds that quirky, spunky charm that is Crazy Jane.Songs like ""24/Seven"" and ""Ride"" have a slow, smooth groove, while others like ""Frica"" are bouncy and fun, and the tune ""Amazing"" showcases the soaring range of Karen's voice.If you appreciate local, independant talent, you'll love Crazy Jane."
2,Weak thesis and no editor,"The author is supposed to be a leading historian and expert on slavery. And the big, deep insight that he works to develop in this text? That things got worse because the South and North distrusted each other. Oh !Aren't authors supposed to collaborate with an editor to improve their books before publication? It looks like this essential step was forgotten. The prose is profusely polluted with run-on sentences, excess words, and meandering constructs that never quite finish making their point. I was amused to see that the author is a Yale professor. He could have gone to the English department at his own school for assistance. Their freshman course is very good. He could improve his writing in just a few months of hard work."
4,For the price!!,"Not a bad unit for the price. I've seen better units that cost more, and worse units that cost the same. Overall decent value"
2,noisy and important,"a noisy little thing, you need one for every lens. cause its a help of a job to remove it from a lens to another."
4,lens adapter,"ok, but made of plastic. lensmate makes a better version out of aluminium, which is actually available. When fitted with a good uv filter and left on the camera it looks great, makes the camera better balanced, protects the lens mechanism, and also works as a great lens hood."
1,Made of plastic,"Dang it. I read a well written review of the Canon G9 (and the need to get a lensmate):http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/G9-Japan.shtmlI went to amazon and ordered this 'lensmate' thinking it would be anodized aluminum. (This plastic version should cost [...] cents, not $[...].) Anyhow, I found the metal one here:http://www.lensmateonline.com/newsite/G7.htmlI think I'll try returning this thing... never tried to return anything through amazon before. I also ordered some UV and polarizing filters -- I hope they are glass and not plastic. :)"
1,Before you buy this for Canon A650:,Wish I had read all reviews before purchase. This does NOT work with the A650. See previous review about 'the white dot'. I just spent $113 to have this removed from my camera - they had to completely take the camera apart.
4,Get one for each lens,I got one of these to attach to each lens. Makes for quick transfer of lenses in the field.
4,Fascinating and practical,"I wasn't sure I would like this book. The topic of workplace psychology can be done wrong in so many ways. You can present it too clinically and thus lack any practicality. And you can slide the other way and shower the user with pop psychology check-lists and acronyms.This book walks the ideal path deftly and presents practical workplace issues with the right blend of psychology background and practical wisdom on how to handle individuals with personality issues.The book is organized by disorder. Each type of personality is presented in it's own chapter with what to look for. As well as how to handle that individual as a boss, a coworker and as a subordinate.A fascinating read on it's own, and practical advice for people stuck in tough jobs where they have to contend with coworkers who have personality problems."
5,An old friend....,I ordered this book from an amazon marketplace seller as a used book. It's a great collection of recipes - I had a copy of this book years ago and am happy to have it in my collection again!
1,Full of Mistakes!,"I have used 4 different resources in preparing for the NCLEX, and this one is glaringly bad. I have found probably 10 or more errors in the practice questions. The question will ask for one thing and then the ""correct"" answer will be the opposite of what the question was asking. i.e. ""What is a sign and symptom of X?"" and then you'll wrack your brain and get to the answer and it'll say ""1 is the only answer NOT a symptom of X."" Some of the answer numbers are wrong as well...it'll put one answer number and then the answer explanation will obviously be referring to a completely different answer choice.I've already written the company telling them that I've found so many mistakes that I'm questioning the efficacy of the whole book. This was added stress when I didn't need it."
5,"If you love metal/rock, you MUST have this CD!","I first heard Drain S.T.H. on the secondary stage at Ozzfest, and spent the next two and a half months trying to find this CD. I HAD to have it. This band blew my mind. Since finally obtaining the CD, the only time it has left my Stack of five CD's I carry in my truck, is to listen to it in the house. These chicks ROCK! The best rock/metal CD I own, and I do own alot of CD's. I recommend it to everyone, even the ""Casual"" metal fan, this CD is everything that the genre should be, it's Awesome!"
1,worst record warp has ever released,"Anyone giving this album a positive review must either be the artists themselves, friends or family members of the artists, Warp records, or their distributor. The artwork for the album is fresh, and that is the only reason why this record deserves one star. I don't enjoy writing negative reviews, and this is probably the first record Warp has released that has made me upset, but Team Shadetek are a completly void of any musical talent. This album can in no way compete with material from RDJ, Squarepusher, Prefuse, LFO, Boards of Canada, or even Chris Clark for that matter."
1,Drivel,"This album, from start to finish, is the sound of a beat box falling down the stairs. It stumbles, it crashes, and it finally ends with blissful silence. There is no melody or rhythm, just a garbled bunch of nonsense looped over and over, track after track. If ""music"" this amateurish is making the grade and being published on Warp Records, I'm going to buy my three year old daughter and drum machine and make millions off of her lack of talent. Save your money!"
3,Hard to open,"These locks are great for cabinets that you don't need to get into very often. I love the flexible arms because they can go around any size knob. We had problems with C-locks because the knobs on our cabinets are too close together - c-locks don't work, but these do. The only problem is these locks are very difficult to open. You cannot open them with one hand."
4,great,I use this lock for my 2 swinging gate outside in the yard its been 2 years and I just now need to get them replaces due to cracking before they do and I have nothing to use to keep my little one in side the gates. yes they are hard to open but I love that fact. if they are had for me to open its hard for my child and that means I can do more yard work and less running after a child that has left the yard.
1,Impossible to open,DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO OPEN THE CABINETS UP AGAIN! Impossible to open!
1,Poor Quality,This lancing device does not work.It doesn't bring the lancet out to pierce my finger.I called the seller and they refused to take the item back.Horrible experience and waste of money.Do not buy from these people.Big rip-off!!!
4,Practical and useful,"This is a great resource to have on your library shelf. Written in a down-to-earth style, it comes packed with practical information for setting-up your video blog, but also some good insider tips on how to do it better, faster and at less cost than you might have imagined."
5,THE SECRET TO CHRISTIAN HAPPINESS IS:,"Hannah was a Quaker lady back in the late 1800s. I read Hannah Whitall Smith's book many years ago. She discovered the secret, and we can have it, if, we pay the price. One cannot just read this book. It is like the Bible. It must be studied. Read a little, chew awhile, then practice. It will be victory to victory for your lifetime.The secret to Christian happiness is found in obedience to God through Jesus Christ, Our Lord.Hannah, I love you."
2,I have never watched this film before,"I will appreciate having a copy of this film from you. I am very much interested in Laurel & Hardy Collections. In fact, it is my best commedy."
1,Some Research Needed,"The Cameras for Collectors Book is fairly eclectic. The author does state that it is based on cameras he has collected or borrowed. However, if I were showing off cameras, I would choose the best examples that I could to demonstrate the item. The book is inconsistent, many descriptions of the cameras are incorrect. I felt that the purchase of this book was not one I would recommend to anyone wishing to know more about older cameras and information about them. If collecting $5 plastic cameras is a hobby for you, then perhaps the book would be a good purchase."
5,Great Book,Excellent book for beginners to get an idea of how to approach the skills needed to paraglide.
3,Staple for Paragliding students,"Much of the information is out of date and the writing leaves much to be desired. That being said, this book is one of the best text books on paraglidig. If you are thinking about taking lessons, your instructor will probably ask you to purchase this book and slog through it like I did."
4,Great book,This is a must for beginning paragliders. It is detailed enough to answer all those little questions that the instructors never seem to have time to give new pilots. The weather information is exceptional.
3,HIP HOP VERSION OF FATAL ATTRACTION,"MARTIN LAWRENCE wrote, directed and starred in this movie. Acting with him are BOBBY BROWN, DELLA REESE and LYNN WHITFIELD. So, this is supposed to be a comedy/drama. The acting was good. Bobby Brown was believable and Lynn Whitfield was very good. Della Reese was Della Resse.I got this movie after I saw Martin Lawrence in BLUE STREAK, which I thought was really, really funny and LAWRENCE was really good. I was hoping this would be equal fun. IT WASN'T.Despite the many rave reviews of others, I can only give this movie 3 stars. At best, It's just OK."
5,Love it,This is a good movie. Hope all players will watch this movie and learn that there are girls out there who wont let you mess with them.... LOL
4,Thin line Between Love and Hate,"A cross between Lawrence humor and Hitchcock suspence. Martin plays the ""playa"" and uses his comedic style to provide the humor. This time there is less of the absurbed humor than in some of his previous movies. The Hithcock suspense is Lynne Whitfield's character. How many ways will she make the man pay and in the end to what degree does the playa learn his lesson. For the Martin Lawrence fan there is no disappointment. Maybe his best to date."
3,martin l turns serious when a female won't leave him alone,this was a good movie 4 martin l it was action pack with some ok comedy in da mix martin was a pimp in this movie gettin almost any girl he wants but 1 girl was playin hard 2 get she wouldn't give him da time or da day martin wouldn't leave her alone until she gave him da attention dat a player deserves and once martin l was tried of her he throw her away like a broken toy but she wouldn't have that she want nyc on martin toward da n of da film 2 da point she was placed in a crazy house also noticable performances from da one and only rena king she was if u want 2 call it martin l mistress who had a man but she liked him and martin l liked her they became boyfriend and girlfriend at da end of da film Joe Brown
1,the black version of the war of the roses,"nothing original here at all.i respect Regina King,Lynn Whitfield&Martin Lawrence but this is pure Hollywood formula.i saw this same film about 11 years back and it was called the war of the roses. didn't like it then and i don't like it now."
5,The best Zoid Model,"I think that this is the best zoid model ever . Even though i like the Liger Zero better i still think model wise that the Berserk Fury is the man.""Do your thing Berserk Fury"" -Vega Obscura"
4,The BERSURK FURY Ultimate X,"This is the Mighty Bersurk Fury! ! ! In the show the bersurk fury is one of the most powerful zoids, but the model is alot different.Well if you like to stare at zoids and not play with them I recemoend this zoid to you. But if you like to play with them its not the best. This zoid is a clumsy walker and tips over with the CpC on it. ( the blades ) but this zoid is strong i had an incedent where this zoid was well.....was Kicked and it...well i thought i spent all my money and it broke. But even though i had to reassemble the legs tail and etc it still worked. I also have dropped it before only 1 1/2 ft on carpet (accidentaly) and it survived. so this zoid looks awsome! But doesnt walk fast or right. Oh also it is compatible with the controller and it has a second movment its tail flaps open and opens its mouth with a flip of a switch. The tail flaps opening is cool. So it looks cool but cant walk. (the 3rd time i said that)"
5,does it live up to it's reputation?,"This zoid is great. I have been building zoids for a year now and I've decided to make a zoids model kits game with teams such as on zoids: New Century Zero, or the bit cloud saga. When I make the game, this model will be on my team. This is my sixteenth model and since it is a supreme, which is the biggest size, it took me 4 hours to build. this zoid has two modes, walking mode and ion attack mode. overall this zoid is awesome just be care ful with the tri-bladed beam canons on the back that can come off easily but not in a breaking matter it is just a loose piece. Hope I was helpful, Bye"
2,to exspensive,"hi im a mother of two ,i had bought 2 of thease voidsmy kids were really dissapionted in this .why there very hard to put together,they com apparteasily,they dont snap in propperly.i dont recomend this toy the kids put themin the box know there sitting there doing nothing,they call it garbage."
5,"Beautiful, Authentic Reproduction of a True Classic","Unfortunately, the first time I heard this legendary record, I heard it on the Rykodisc CD re-issue.Not to say that the music wasn't still enjoyable, but hearing it here on this outstanding, high-fidelity, 180g vinyl is a whole different experience. Plus, it's in the original order, so the authenticity here is another giant perk to this edition.The transfer is superb- No noticeable noise or distortion, and a natural and warm tone throughout (but especially on acoustic guitar and on Chilton's masterfully shaky voice). ""Blue Moon"" was already one of my favorite Big Star tunes, and hearing it here was a lasting joy. Every track sounds better than ever.There's not too much else to say except that this is a masterpiece and a must-own, especially on heavy-weight vinyl.Definitely worth your money.R.I.P. Alex Chilton"
4,Warning: Rykodisc Version of Big Star 3rd!,"If you're familiar with Rykodisc's earlier remixed, resequenced version of this amazing album, then be assured that's what this is.What this isn't is a CD version of the original LP (original mix, original track sequence) as recently released on vinyl by 4 Men with Beards. The only thing about this release that is accurate to the original album is its cover, which also includes the original track listing. But it has nothing to do with the actual contents of the CD.Note: Rykodisc's bonus tracks are included on this release."
5,Uncensored....Well kind of,"It seems like they forgot to remove the beeps when they swear in some episodes. One I remember is episode 7 ""My morning straight jacket"". It's 1 minute and 45 seconds in. It still beeps and there doesn't appear to be another audio track that has the censor removed. I am thinking they forgot to remove the censor or lost the original audio track.Aside from that, I think this release really should of been released on blu-ray. Half the episodes were aired in HD, so people who pirate the show (in HD) have better versions than people who actually pay for it. If fox really wanted to reduce the number of illegal downloads (and increase their sales) for their shows they wouldn't screw us over with a sub-par releases like this one.Show: 10/10Everything else: 3/10"
1,Great DVD's Aweful packaging!,"This is the second DVD I've bought in the last few weeks, the other being Family Guy Vol-9, both were damaged upon opening them. The flimsy tray was broken so the DVD's don't stay in the case. Is this an Amazon thing on A Fox thing?"
5,fun,fun times great show I love it. But I kinda hate that I have to write a review just to leave some stars. Kinda makes me not want to review things
2,Great show but Not UNCENSORED,Most of the episodes are censored. First episode is uncensored but almost all of the others are bleeped out. Really sad. Look Fox/Seth we're all grown ups here. Not gonna offend anyone. Still love the show though just think we got screwed again.
2,Uncensored my foot,"In big letters on the back at the top it says ""Uncensored and Outrageous"" and in the small print describing the special features it says ""on select episodes"". This is annoying and misleading. I want the uncensored version of each episode! Also annoying is that half the episodes are full screen and half are wide. This show is still great but this collection seems like an uneven thrown together hodge-podge."
2,Was good for about a year,"I bought this saw a little over a year ago and used it less than ten times. Mostly for thin gauge exhaust and roll cage tubing. Have way though cutting some exhaust yesterday the saw quit. I thought it was a breaker, but I still had power at the cord... I believe it is the switch in the handle as I can hear a faint clicking coming from the handle. It seems that the replacement switch is over $40!! I have to look into what the warranty covers..."
2,Wouldn't cut square,"I'm not sure what the problem was with mine, but it wouldn't make a square cut despite several tries on 1""x1"" steel tubing. I ended up using a air tool with a cutting wheel instead, which was a lot of work. Each time I tried to make a cut, the pressure would make the wheel move off to the side. I decided to ease up on the pressure. Even with very little pressure, the wheel would move off to the side resulting in something other than a 90 degree cut."
3,Great Saw - poor clamp,"For the price, this is a great saw. I've had mine for over a year and cut steel for building trailers etc, so 2x2 tubing is my mainstay. The big problem with mine is the Vise assembly. If you tighten it down, the clampling screw assembley will bind and NOT let go, then it's Pipe wrench time. I'm redesiging my vise now, but plan on buying a Coldsaw if all else fails."
5,A funny and insightful way of looking at stress!,Loretta is a joy to watch. Her facial expressions add so much to the words she speaks. She has a true gift. Tah - dah!
2,"Love Voltaire's fiction, not compelled by this book, however.","After reading Candid, I wanted more! I had read reviews for this book, and purchased it expecting random short reads on interesting subjects, and perhaps opinions (more than likely requiring months of time spent on Wikipedia, a to understand who they reference).I didn't get much from this book. I felt it a bit too arrogant, a bit too boring, and the references a bit too obscure. Perhaps if I wasn't already an existential nihilist, it might be more shocking or revealing, but, instead, I crave a second to Candid. Can someone lend a recommendation in means of a comment to this review suggesting my next great Voltaire read? It doesn't have to be fiction; but something -entirely not like this."
4,women as leaders,"This carefully conducted research study of how women manage and how women lead provides a baseline for similar studies that follow. Women really do manage and lead differently, and that difference enriches the workplace. I am using this as one of the texts in a web based graduate course focusing on leadership that I am teaching. There are leadership lessons for everyone here."
4,Descriptions of different styles of leadership by women,"Includes a ""day in the life of"" Barbara Grogan, who at the time of writing (1990) was forty-three year-old founder and president of Western Industrial Contractors, a $6 million millwrighting firm in Denver. Grogan is one of many successful women profiled with an eye toward spotting gender characteristics that give women an edge"
3,"A Well-written, but Expensive Polemic","David Noble effectively makes the case against online education. He points out that the rush to ""clicks"" means not only the replacement of ""bricks"" but also the replacement of people (or, more accurately, replacing many people who think with fewer people who count, but don't think.Noble is a first-rate essayist-his ""In Defense of Luddism"" (in Progress without People) is wonderful. One problem is that Noble will have persuaded many readers after five pages, but won't have persuaded others after reading five volumes. A second is that readers could skim the basics of Noble's argument for free online (currently at [URL) and send a donation to the Monthly Review Press (a worthy cause). The book contains some added prose, but doesn't add much to Noble's argument."
5,Tasty waves and cerveza,"Cool movie. I am no film critic, I just happen to really like all the things covered in this film. This is not a full on surf flick (i.e. it has a story beyond surfing), it is about some bros that hit baja and things get weird. Seems vaguely familiar, but then I was never in my right mind when I used to camp and surf in Mexico... Watch it in your sandy wetsuit"
5,You must buy this DVD!,"If you surf Baja, have ever traveled Baja or simply love a good indie, this is it. You'll love the surf scenes and the story is one we all face at some point in life!"
2,Pretty cheesy and not very funny,"I guess it wasnt the worst movie i have ever seen, but it was pretty forgettable. It couldve been funny, it couldve been cool. It didnt really make it past either of those hurdles. I wouldnt call it a surf movie-as they only surf briefly in the end. Its just a bit dis-jointed and choppy. The proposal is the cheesiest thing i have ever seen in a movie. I dont think these situations would actually ever come up in someones life, and ive been to mexico!"
3,Phil Woods early NYC,"Shows Phil and a bunch of NYC ""Gunners"" just on the get go. Bebop delux! What a time it must have been when a lot of legendary music was just getting going all centered around New York City 1956 - 1959 The CD probably contains music first issued as two 10'LPs Good stuff,great Phil some of it probably during his Brooklyn days pre Dizzy pre Quincy"
5,Excellent,"Sometimes you come across a book that is a ""must have"" and this is one of them. In a day of shallow preaching, this work helps readers understand why it is so important to develop a text in keeping with the context of the orginal writer."
5,Biblical Preaching: The Development and Delivery of Expository Messages,"No issues with receiving book. This good book explains the difference between a topical sermon, textual sermon and an expository sermon. The expository sermon is one we should all want when we hear a sermon. It explains the meaning of biblical text. It gives a common sense perspective to Scripture."
4,Awesome,"Young preacher, just starting out,thought the book was great. I would recommend it to others, explained in very indepth but simple terms. Did not leave you wondering, very complete in thought. I learned alot from this book."
5,Great for the beginner,"I have had a desire to preach for sometime and in 2008 opportunities became available. I have not had any formal training or any real direction. A preacher recommended this book to me and I'm glad he did. After reading this book, I had direction and an aim for each sermon. This book got me in the right direction. The most useful information I received was the importance of getting the ""main idea"". Before you begin a sermon you must be able to state the sermon in one clear sentence. I highly recommend this book, to everybody. You will notice the difference between the preacher that does his homework and the one that doesn't!"
1,very diappointed,The author expresses his oppinion about preachers and teachers from the beginning of the book however he doesn't seem to distinguish that it is men only who are called to be preachers and teachers therefore a person who believes this idea has a cheap ideal of christ and his headship and between male and female which is a shame.
4,Excellent book for beginning preachers,This is an excellent book for any man who is interested in preaching the word of God accurately to the church. The simple structure that Robinson brings to the reader is easy to understand and a wonderful method of sermon preparation and communication.
2,Bad design,I bought this vent mount for my garmin nuvi 350. It's an ok product if you don't mind the thing jiggling aroung on your a/c vent. Appearantly it's not desingned for every car exactly. Despite the adjustment features it has it still can not maintian a steady footing on my a/c vent. And it was not easy to remove from the vent. Overall not a good buy. I wouldn't waste the money.
1,Didn't work.,"Didn't work for my car (landrover), or my mom's car (toyota corolla), or my fiances car (yukon). It just pointed down towards the floor with each of them. However, if it fits for your car it would be a good thing to have, so the gps isn't attached to the window. I went back to using my friction mount, which I love."
5,Works like a charm,"This drain looks good and works without any problem with our new vessel sinks. You push it to close the drainage, and push it again to open it. It works like a charm. We can also unscrew it to clean hair residue."
4,Works like $150 counter part,THis is a great and affordable counter part to Duravit pop up drain. It works great and looks beautiful. We shall see about its longevity but I have used it for more than 6 months and it is going strong.
5,quick and complete,"ordered on a saturday and recieved it on the following thursday, the order was complete with all of the pieces it needs to mount to a sink."
3,ADVENTURE AND NOTHING MORE,"Probably this is one of those films that would never be considered as a masterwork. But it is one of those films you always watch. Because it is pure entertaning. You have exotic locations, a hero, a heroine, the villian...Again another technicolor adventure this time in Colombia. The perfect excuse to create a ""typical"" hacienda in the Hollywood way but with the usual good taste of that genious who was Ceddric Gibbons and see Miss Kelly wearing those outfits by Helen RoseThe great star here is, evidently Stewart Granger, playing a not , particularly nice hero. Let's face it if someone can play a hero who is not perfect is he. The problem is that Miss Kelly seems lost in the film. I mean, she is beautiful as always but her manners are sometimes annoying. She lacks the energy that Deborah Kerr would have given to the character.This is another example of craftsmanship of studios in the 50's. It is a film for pure enjoyment."
1,A sad waste of Grace Kelly's talent,"I have seen all of Grace Kelly's movies, and this one stands out as by far the least appealing.Grace's talents are wasted in the silly movie. Grace plays a lonely coffee plantation owner who meets Stewart Granger, a thoroughly awful cad, and we are supposed to believe that the two fall in love, even though there is zero chemistry between them.Ms Kelly herself has stated publically her great dislike of this film, and I for one agree with her."
5,GRACE IN CINEMASCOPE,"IN 1954 MGM sent their cameras to Colombia,South America,for this very pleasant adventure movie. Although not a masterpiece, the beautiful locations helped a rather mild story about emerald fever. Stewart GRANGER and Paul DOUGLAS are quite convincing as the mining buddies, but Grace KELLY seems bored and not interested by her role through most of the film, wearing gloves in a coffee plantation(in Colombia, with an average temperature of 110in the shade !!!) and changing dresses (created by Helen ROSE, of course !)in pratically every scene !!! Well that was part of Hollywood Magic, I guess...The DVD from WB Archive Collection is in very good shape, in Widescreen, Stereo sound and color by Eastmancolor. The impressive music is from the talented MIKLOS ROZSA...Who could ask for more ? Thank you again, AMAZON !!!!!!!!"
5,Nice even heat,Bought to use in a small chicken house. It is perfect. It keeps the chicken house evenly warm and our chickens have continued to lay eggs in the coldest months as a result.
2,Cane,"The cane looks perfect, but the adjusmenet nut was galled so I never used it. It was this way when I received it. I am afraid I may fall if the adjustment slipped.Thanks, Glenn Moberly"
1,Multinational corporate capitalism to the rescue!,"Terrifically disappointing multinational-corporatism-capitalist (MCC) propaganda piece. The author's premise seems to come down to this--people can only be free and happy in shadows of MCC. Phrases (no kidding!) like ""What went wrong--*too much democracy*"" actually appear throughout the book. Trade unions are vehicles of ""thuggery,"" etc etc etc. Honest to god, I'm basically speechless after wading through the book. An establishment, corporatist ""take"" on how/why people get what they deserve when they dare to reject free marketry (and are then deliberately hobbled by those in a position to behave in a moral, responsible, socially conscious manner)....much like Cuba is held up to Americans as ostensible proof of socialism's abject failure, rather than what happens when a country is cut off/isolated and left to die, rather than respected and engaged. An excellent example of the logical fallacy of false-dilemna."
1,Cheap and dissapointing,I bought this for my boyfriends car and as it was being installed (by a professional) the cheap wire that connects from the fuse to the LED light tore. The wires are so thin that with any type of pressure the connection will be lost. I completely regret this buy and now the shifter is just sitting in a drawer lifeless...don't waste your money.
2,Already reviewed,Didn't put this on I bought the wrong one and couldn't use it so I sent it back. It did look a little difficult to put on it had a lot of wires with it.
1,UK version?,"You have UK version and some others,but how about offering the US version?And can you make it available for theKindle Fire?"
4,Major John André was recently hung for spying,"The is here adventure enough and romance for all.A visit home to see the family turns badfor a British Captain of Infantry.A peddler ans a gentleman stranger are what the plot turns on.Here are ""Cowboys"" as mounted British soldiers before the moderncowboy was thought of.Here are spies and daring escapes in the middle of raging war.All this takes in rural 1780's New York.It isn't as good or as bad as some of Cooper's writing,but it is well told with some surprises along the way."
2,The Book of Falling Quality,"Berendt's writing style is engaging as always, but the book is so unfocussed that it is more confusing than readable. Instead of concentrating on a single crime/scandal, and then spiraling outwards from that (which he did remarkably well in his first book), this book bounces around between several notorious deeds spread across large expanses of time, and all of them are chronicled to wildly varying degrees -- and some have questionable ""conclusions"" and some are just abandoned in the middle of the book and never mentioned or concluded in any fashion."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm a lover of books on Italy, non-fictional as well as fictional, but I don't think I've ever read a duller book. A physics textbook would be more exciting. And I loved 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"", so I was shocked that John Berendt wrote such a snoozer. If you want to read a much more interesting and fun book about Venice, I recommend Marlena De Blasi's ""A Thousand Days in Venice."""
1,Painfully Dull,"I feel like an idiot after reading all of the wonderful reader reviews on this page, but I cant stand it. I have to say it. The emperer is NAKED!!!!This is the story of one of the most interesting cities in the world, populated by some of the most excentric and interesting people in the world, visited by one of the most BORING authors in the world!!!!Is it too late for me to return this book back to Amazon? Probably, because it took me over a month to drag myself through this painful piece. I kept reading, with the hope that something would happen. I think that my home owners policy would make for better reading"
3,"Too much ""Look who I found'","The book came recommended to me by another traveler, and because of an upcoming trip to Venice, I thought I'd get some help in better understanding the city on what would be my third visit. Instead, I found way too many profiles of Venetians who were either recognized celebrities or eccentrics. Frankly, half this many reports on people the author discovered would have been sufficient. After a while, it seemed Berendt was just trying to show off at being able to move among the locals. I would have preferred to read more about nonentities who make the unique city function."
4,This nonfiction reads like a novel...,"I picked this book up somewhere as a vacation read without realizing it was nonfiction. I was a bit disappointed when I discovered this, but determined to read it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this nonfiction was an artful tale of events which occurred in Venice, ingeniously retold by the author. Berendt is a masterful storyteller, weaving his own observations of Venetians and real events into a complex tapestry of a city most outsiders aren't privy to. I thoroughly enjoyed Berendt's follow-up to Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."
5,Getting There Is More Than Half The Fun,"Unlike a Point A to Point B exposé or novel, Mr. Berendt's latest book follows a serpentine path through an intriguing city, introducing the reader to the blue-blooded, the base-born, the brazen and the bizarre inhabitants of an enigmatic and complex city. At several points in this book, it is unclear where the author is going, but with such mesmerizing narration, the reader really doesn't care. An excellent book!"
3,Come back to Savannah,This is no Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. I found the book lacking a plot or specific story. It is an ok read but I felt letdown.
3,Too much like a tourist guide ...,"I have been to Venice and I agree with John Berendt that the city holds interesting surprises for anyone who is willing to look beyond the trodden paths. I bought the book because I like novels that have a historical or real-world aspect and are not just pure fiction, but this book is not truly a novel. The plot is weak and the characters don't come across. Venice is beautifully described, but I had a hard time to read the book to the end."
1,One of the Worst Books I ever read,What happend to the wonderful characters of Midnight like the Lady Chablis it appears Mr. Berendt is truly ONE HIT WONDER....What shame....I think his luck has run dry...Perhaps the Lady was his lucky charm
1,A Star for Venice,"All Venice lovers will pick up this book as a must-read, but many will put it down with disappointment. The supposed theme is scandal and intrigue, beginning with the alleged arson at the opera house and trailing through a glass blower's family arguing about the business and a woman who is said to have tried to steal an archive and failed. None of it is very convincing; none of the accused have plausible motives; the sources seem random; some of the writing is piercingly shrill; and on the whole, who cares? For anyone interested in Venice, there are hundreds of books available, and this one ranks very near the bottom."
4,A Portrait of a City,"Having been one of the annoying tourists that swarm through St. Mark's and the Rialto, it was fascinating to gain an insider's perspective on a city that, at first, I had not found all that attractive. I thoroughly enjoyed the snapshots of the local color in Venice, particularly the Plant Man, whom I believe proves beyond dispute that fact can be stranger, and more entertaining, than fiction. A few of the snapshots overextend themselves, particularly the ones concerning the Curtises and Ezra Pound; however, Venice in the end won me over, and I would recommend this book to anyone who has any appreciation of history or culture."
2,a trivial book of gossip,"I was looking forward to a great book about Venice, but it was such a disappointment. It was just chatter about nothing really important .... Gossip that didn;t really mean anything to the development of Venice."
3,Interesting information about Venice and the people who live there,I found it hard to get into but now am finding it hard to put down. Traveling to Italy and particularly Venice so wanted to get a feel for the city which this book does give you enough information for that. . Can't believe there are not cars there and the water is all around. Can't wait to get a feel of the city for myself in a few months.
3,Interesting bits do not make for a compelling whole,"This book was a great disappointment. Though the center of the book is supposed to be the burning of La Fenice, this narrative lacks a focus. There are many fascinating bits of information here but the book sometimes feels like an overly long magazine piece. For a real feeling of Venice read the crime novels of Donna Leon. The first in her series is ""Death at La Fenice."""
1,Kindle costs more than paperback edition,I'm giving this one star because the electronic edition costs more than the paperback print edition. This is ridiculous as what does it really cost the publisher to sell an electronic edition of a book? I imagine it costs them nothing once it's converted. . .
2,A very tedious book,"I got this book because I liked Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. This book should have been titled ""What I did on my vacation in Venice"". I have a rule to give up on a book after 100 pages but I broke my own rule because I kept thinking the book was going somewhere. It wasn't. It was like Midnight in that it gave you lots of side events in Venice but in Midnight there was an overarching crime. There was an attempt in this book to make the burning of the Fenice Opera House a similar overarching theme but it really wasn't nearly as interesting. I should have given up after 100 pages............"
2,Not as good as his first book,"Compared to his first book, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, this book disappointed me. The story is totally lacking in tension and overall the tone and theme seem a bit pretentious to me, with all the talk of Venetian doges and wealthy ex-patriates living in palazzos. I found it difficult to enjoy this story."
4,An intimate glimpse of the real Venice,"Let's start with a disclaimer: I LOVE Venice. It is a beautiful, interesting, romantic city. If I could, I'd return to visit regularly. Berendt has done a wonderful job capturing the spirit of Venice and its people. While this book is nominally about the burning of the Fenice Opera House and the subsequent investigation and reconstruction, these events really just serve as framework around which a colorful exploration of the city in which it is built. The book is a series of chapter-long asides that delve into the colorful characters that inhabit Venice and make it such a interesting place. These asides weave these gossipy stories together with the vast history and iconic architecture of Venice to provide an amazingly intimate glimpse into the Venice that few tourists ever get to see. This is the next best thing to visiting Venice itself."
3,Interesting but flawed,"After Midnight in the Garden of good and evil, I picked this up with great anticipation.Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. While in Midnight, Berendt gets you quickly into the mystery and quirkiness of all those deep US-south characters, he fails to do the same here with Venice.The plot revolves around the fire the La Fenice opera house in Venice, but much of his handling here comes across as little more than a travelogue of the city and history of the opera house itself. The main characters don't really come to life at any time.A shame, because Berendt is clearly a fine writer. Possibly if he'd had somewhat less than a twenty year gap between novels it would have helped. He then perhaps wouldn't have felt so inclined to lump every small fact on the reader, whether pertinent, exciting or not."
3,Interesting....,"A somewhat different look at Venice and its people. A very many interesting characters are brought to life with Berendt's words, he does write well and even though some people and circumstances weren't as interesting as others and perhaps induced a little boredom it was still written in true Berendt fashion and I knew I wouldn't be bored for long before another interesting character popped up and said hello.I did learn quite a few things from this book, it is centred loosely around the Fenice burning down and the court case afterwards but along the way we delved into quite a lot of history of Venice and its inhabitants and I loved reading how as the water rises they just simply build up a bit higher so that there are actual houses and whatnot underneath the current Venice city, Napoleon's being one such house.It was a great non-touristy look at Venice, Berendt lived there for a while and started off in the ""not tourist season"" because he wanted to see the real Venice."
2,"Interesting reading, but not recommended!","I enjoyed the book, but I felt it was a mix of a lot of different parts that didn't really come to a larger whole. The people and facts were intesting, but the whole time I'm reading it, I kept thinking, ""what does this have to do with the storyline?"" I thought that some of the characters talked about would do at least something in the end, but I was left with very brief explanations as to why they were even in the book to begin with. For anyone wanting to read this book, find it at a half price store and don't pay full price for it!"
1,Venice lite and less,"With part of the main topic being Venice,I had hoped for more information about the city; instead of too much information about a very wide variety of characters very loosely related to the central idea.Good to fair is my best appraisal.The book started off well and seemed to promise more than it could deliver in the end.The first half was far better than the end.Comparing to Under The Tuscon Sun,The City of Falling Angels(both nonfiction) -falls quite a bit;unable to sustain real long term interest,with light weight characters who offer no real intrigue or development.The taste of Venice which the author offered was weak and without the texture I desired."
2,city of falling angels,"Dull, just couldn't get into caring about about a bunch of class conscience snobs. Loved Midnight."
3,not worth the time,"I picked up this book in preperation for a trip to Venice. I thought I could get a feel for the city while enjoying an interesting story. Not so. The book does provide information on the history of Venice and the people, mostly writers and artists, who love the city but I hoped for more. I finished but only because I was skimming for tidbits about Venice."
2,"Gossipy, elitist, Manhattan provincialism","Someone like John Berendt, former editor of New York magazine, reminds me of why I left Manhattan, with its small-mided delusional ego-centrism. He's an unskilled writer and thinker, with the soulful depth of a gossip columnist. Pick your favorite town or city, and imagine someone spinning the news-making personalities (University heads, retired CEO's, Mayors, developers, elites and gold-diggers) into a porttrait of your town, coated with a pretense of depth through literary references. You'd be incensed. Most people don't care about the trials of the rich and famous (maybe 10% of the population does, enough to keep books like this successful) -- they care about real stuff, like life, death, happiness, meaningful work, family etc. There's nothing important here. This is not Venice today, and the inhabitants of the city are right to ignore the book."
1,Gave up after 103 pages,"If a book cannot grab me within the first 100 pages, then I have to stop. Not only that, but it was due at the library, and there is a waiting list (why?). I just have little time, and so many other books to read.I will say that what I did read was somewhat interesting, and the writing was good. I just wasn't that interested in the story - at least at 100+ pages. It must get better, but I wish that I was made to care earlier in the writing.Sorry if this wasn't very helpful, this review is more of my opinion than a critique."
5,Excellent book about a beautiful city,"The book gives a fascinating history of the city of Venice, an incredible feat of determination and engineering genius. You can skip the boring section on Ezra Pound."
1,Overlong Vanity Fair Gossip Article,"Sorry, but I did enjoy the first pages of this book, but it bogged down and became a silly he said/she said.........I skipped on, and found another of the same. I will finish it shortly and throw it away."
2,Little to do with Venice,"I bought this book as I am interested in how people live in various parts of the world. The author noted early on that no one has written about people that actually live in Venice. He is correct, and they still haven't. About 60% of this book is about the boring lives and political infighting of society types, most of whom are from New York. Why does anybody think these people are interesting? But if you like Britney Spears or Paris Hilton, maybe you will like this. It does have a few good parts when he can drag himself away from royalty, society and literary types, but most of the book is boring."
3,good if you are interested in venice,Nice writing and does give a sense of the city. Not a lot of depth. More a book to read before going to Venice. Easy to put down but also easy to read. Light.
3,"Refreshing, but at times too slow pace",Quite a nice read. But I don't found it as excellent as others claimed.
1,Disappointing,So sorry I bought this in hardcover. I don't know if I can even finish it. Boring! Boring!
4,Curiosity with a Means,"A journalist by trade, Berendt manages to succeed in depicting an atmosphere more than just telling a tale (or complicated weave of such). Blessed with the occassion to expound for some 398 pages, he illustrates a world in terms of the goings-on within it better than one could ever find in a work of journalism.A city is the protagonist of his book, as the title attests. The strength of his writing is in his recognition that one can only understand a place by knowing what happens there and one can only understand what takes place by knowing well its setting. I closed the final page feeling as though I had been somewhere and witnessed something, first-hand, and had now arrived at some understanding of it all.I applaud his ability to write a nonfiction piece in the first-person but manage to never seem to intrude on the action or its depiction. I wish more journalists would follow suit, so long as they could hold our interest as well as Berendt for as long as is necessary."
3,fun and easy read,"many interesting facts, people and history. Writing is a bit choppy, but definitely a perfect book that will stimulate curiosity in the world around us."
5,The City of Falling Angels,This is a book I could not put down. I suggest this to anyone who is planning a trip to Italy (or not!)
2,Only 'ok'.,I prefer books with a strong plot. This didn't really seem to have a strong plot and the pieced never really seems to come together as strongly as I had hoped. It may just be the style of this author... and if you like that type of style this would be a book for you.
2,2 out of 5,"As a non-fiction book, I expected to encounter truths and facts, but I found the author went overboard on many occasions in his descriptions of passages that had no relevance to the story. I also marveled at the willingness of just about everyone the author met to divulge information that he should not have been privy to, and at times the author was a down-right nuisance to a police investigation with his Sherlock Holmes attitude. However, he did manage to interest me in 2 specific subjects that I had no prior knowledge of."
4,Entertaining,"TCoFA is a set of intertwining stories (non-fiction, occasionally of the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction variety) set in Venice. Perhaps because I had the great pleasure of visiting Venice many years ago, and, like the author, was so charmed by it myself (it is one of my favorite places on the planet), I was particularly disposed to enjoy TCoFA. Even so, Berendt is a fine writer and the stories he chose to tell are interesting in their own right. There isn't much substance between the covers of TCoFA, but there's heaps of flash to entertain."
3,Nice little book,"What can one expect following the earlier book. A slight let-down. But still a nice little book on the vagaries of another tarnished port city. Berendt does a good job handling the various kooks, nuts and average Venetians he comes across in a fair and even-handed way.He does a fine job explaining Venice in a non-traditional way, and made me want to visit off season, to really check the place out.He also piqued my interest in the labrynth that is the Italian legal system.All in all a fine little book."
2,Petty and Pretentious,"If Venice is a city you've always dreamed of visiting, or your favorite travel destination, this book still isn't for you! Don't get me wrong, I love great stories filled with interesting and eccentric characters, as this book is billed. Trouble is, this book doesn't deliver on that score either.Sure there are some great stories buried in the pages of social party drivel, like the Seguso glass dynasty - worth every paragraph and more.But mostly Berendt's long awaited follow-up to Midnight is chock full of gossip, innuendo, and pandering blather about all the ""great"" people Berendt can name - John, I get it, you can list all the hall of famers on the 19th and early 20th century facist poet dream team. Trouble is I DON'T CARE.With so many great and beautiful books in the world about Venice and it's people, this work lacks the luster or unique perspective worthy of the slog to get through it."
1,BOOOORRRRINNNNG!,"I really liked Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. I didn't find this book a difficult read, just a tremendously tedious one. There is absolutely NO plot to this book. It's just one person's ""story"" after another. I got to a point where I didn't care about Venice or about the characters, I just wanted the book to end and be far away from me. At least in Midnight, the characters' stories were centered around a central plot. Not so here. There is a fire in Venice's main opera house. That's all the plot there is. From there it's just the main ""character"" doing interview after interview of people. And not having to do with the fire either. Just non-stop boring stories."
1,Disappointment,"I wanted a mystery, not a tour of Venice. Read it if you want, but borrow it, don't buy it."
2,Story does not grab you,I got half way through and stopped reading- it was not compelling. I can't remember if I've ever done that before. I did learn about the history and local culture of Venice.
4,Not as eccentric,"I noticed with this book that I often make comparisons to previous books that I have read. At first I was concerned that I do this, but after contemplating it more I have come to the conclusion that I have to have some type of base to work from. In the Olympics the subjective sports usually give lower scores to the first person performing so that they setup their base for future performers. Well this performer was based on the previous work by Berendt, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Where Midnight read at times like a mystery, The City of Falling Angels feels more like a grouping of short stories with a splatter of lawyer/trial thrown in. The book still does a great job of describing the real sense of Venice and its people. It makes me want to go and see the city and the Fenice just as I was able to visit Savannah."
3,Nice read,"An interesting, if somewhat long winded, take on an event in Venice. Makes you want to visit Venice, more than you want to know the resolution of the fire at the opera house there."
2,Hard work,"Being an opera singer myself the La Fenice fire was a topic that was compelling for me. I had also recently visited Venice and the newly restored La Fenice so it was high on my list of books to read. What's more I had read and thoroughly enjoyed Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. So what was stopping this book from becoming an unputdownable adventure?It seemed to me that Berendt simply ran out of ideas. What we ended up with was a boring litany of squabbles amongst a pack of mad rich socialites who aren't interesting and who, for the most part, aren't even Venetian.I stayed to the end just out of curiosity - to find out the end of the La Fenice story - but was quite relieved when I finally reached the last page."
1,disappointing,"This book starts off great, but becomes a let down very quickly. It seems the writer ran out of story and didn't know where to go. It turns into a gossipy soap opera."
2,A Venice Root Canal,"The author's more famous ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" is a great accomplishment, on the knife's edge between extraordinary and over-the-top. ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" stops a hair's breadth from being over-the-top---which is precisely what makes it brilliant.The ""City of Falling Angels is well ""over-the-top"", meaning pretentious, excessive, non-credible, and offensive---except possibly for readers with a sick interest in the vulgar vulgar rich."
2,holiday in dullsville,"Although I opened the book with great anticipation, I found it surprisingly boring. Berendt pads the story with numbing descriptions of palaces and mansions. He spends so much time eyeballing ceilings it's a wonder he survived with his neck intact. Adding insult to injury, he then veers into a Reader's Digest history of Venice, with profiles of famous former inhabitants. All of which can be found elsewhere. Midnight... was a classic work. This book was simply unnecessary."
2,I tried..,After reading Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil I was excited to read The City of Falling Angels. I tried so hard to get through this book it was incredibly boring and dry. I appreciate the amount of work that went into this book with all of the historical facts and such. I was just wanting more. It literally took me 2 months to read this only reading a few pages a day....very little interest at all. If anything I took away an extreme amount of knowledge of Venice. I wish the author had focused more on the Fenice plot. I felt like I was reading a textbook...it definitely did not compare to Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.
3,An Odd Approach,"I will read anything about Venice, but this book puzzled me.Ostensibly, the author decides to trace the events surrounding the fire which destroyed ""La Fenice."" To an extent, he delivers by getting close to suspects, prosecutors, persons in-the-know, and various Venetian characters.Yet, in the doing, he inserts himself in to myriad Venice intrigues, often talking blandly to both sides before going back to his keyboard and spilling the beans--to what ends?Reviewers have said many informants feel stabbed in the back by this haphazard gossiping. I can imagine they do, but for me all this pointless rumormongering simply cluttered the book."
2,Meandering.,"Meandering but not in the same interesting way of the Venetian alleyways. Sorry, but if it hadn't had the name Berendt attached, I wouldn't have read more than 50 pages. I kept hoping for the book to deliver. It did not. And I'm sad to have had to write that. I had such high hopes when I cracked the book open."
3,"An interesting look at Venice, but not a ""great"" book","A friend gave this book to me as I was headed off to Venice for vacation. I had no expectations regarding the kind of story, but I did expect a great story given the author and topic. However, I was disappointed. It almost felt like a Vanity Fair article, or one long gossip column. Even so, I did persevere and finish the book because the redeeming qualities were that of the details. Venice is indeed a unique and enchanting city. So I enjoyed learning about some of the areas and buildings and the ins and outs of the people while reading the book. I do believe it had an impact on my impression of the city. So for that, I was pleased. But if you are expecting a good mystery, or a coherent plot line at best, don't; it's not that kind of book at all."
2,"Not the same Autumn that did ""Return To The Breath"" and ""Hating Tree""","This is a different group from the one that did ""Return to the Breath"" and ""Hating Tree"". If you're looking for goth/ethereal/darkwave music this ""Autumn"" is not the right group."
4,Woodall family tree,"This is a great book for those interested in the Woodall family of Talbot County, Georgia. I think most of the information in the earlier years is correct, however, I found just a few mistakes in the later years, i.e. dates and names re: the Dugas family decendants. A lot of sweat, time and energy must have been spent on this book. I cherish it and thank the authors for this astounding account of this great family."
2,David Gorman,"6 Nightmares was actually only one or two nightmares. Anthony Lake begins discussing the global dangers facing our nation today, but eventually digresses and gives us his autobiography instead. He also dedicates quite a bit of space towards how Bill Clinton really wasn't as bad as he seemed to be and how we are all victims of the vast right-wing conspiracy.There were plenty of interesting insider tidbits, but I think an article in TIME might have been more appropriate than dedicating a whole book to Anthony Lake."
5,"A mystery to me, no mystery for my 18 month old","My 18 month old just loves this book. Perhaps it is because we started reading this book and learning how to holding up ""one"" finger at the same time."
1,This book is lame.,"This book only impresses naive, unthinking people with lazy minds. There are many logical errors and contradictions in this collection of talks. For instance, under ""Proofs and Evidences of the Existence of God"", 'Abdu'l-Baha states, ""The contingent world is the source of imperfections"", but later under ""Modification Of Species"", he states the opposite, for he says, ""...the universe has no imperfection,..."" Well, which is it? Another talk asserts ""The Nonexistence of Evil"", where he omitts the very real evils that men do to themselves and others, such as murder, rape, thieft, lying, etc. The list goes on and on. I recommend this work only to active, critical, free-thinkers, that they may become well informed on the muddled reasoning of the faithful. 'Abdu'l-Baha was just another over-hyped guru, and this collection proves it.Some Answered Questions (1908)"
4,Robert Newton Chiller,"The Hidden Room is a good vehicle for Robert Newton. He plays a doctor, who finds out his wife is having an affair. He kidnaps the lover and plans to kill him. I can't comment on the quality of the Sinister Cinema DVD; I purchased the DVD from Incredibly Strange Filmworks. This print is not restored, and has lots of visual flaws. Nonetheless, an excellent suspense thriller."
2,I would not recommend,"I got this book hoping to learn about ways to increase intelligence and overall brain function. Unfortunately, the book only talks about how certain machines may have the ability to increase intelligence, but it doesn't offer any substantial evidence. In addition, it doesn't offer any way of actually utilizing these machines to increase intelligence. It is also very repetitive and disorganized."
5,"the book ""Megabrain"" by Michael Hutchison","The book arrived in excellent condition and in a fairly short amount of time. I am still weaving my way through the book's pages, but I can say emphatically that it has provided me impetus to begin making full use of some of it's recommendations."
1,this book is outdated.,"This book was originally released in 1981, and then rereleased in 1986. Although the title states it is about ""NEW"" tools and techniques for brain growth and mind expansion, the tools and techniques are in fact 20 years old. You should see the black and white photo section of the antiquated electronics! Don't bother with this book - there has to be something more recent out there."
3,A Great Movie...But....,"As a movie alone it's great.Plenty of action. But if your looking for true facts about Bonnie & Clyde, go buy a biography dvd. I read a book that was written by Buck Barrow's wife Blanche - called ""My Life With Bonnie & Clyde"" [ an excellent read ], and in it she says that the movie is anything but the true story of Bonnie & Clyde...and it is so vey inaccurate historically. As for an example, the scene where B & C capture Texas Ranger Frank Hamer and humiliate him...Blanche says that never happened. In fact, the only time Hamer ever saw B & C was when he and 5 other law men killed them in Louisiana. But, I guess thats Hollywood for ya. Always stretching the truth to the max."
3,Bonnie & Clyde,"It's enoyable, even after seeing it years ago. The acting is a little stale, but it's worth the money, to be watched on a cold rainy night, with pop corn, in front of the fire. The cars and music are wonderful. Try to over look the error in accuracy, and remember, it's only Hollywood!"
2,A fiction-based story,"Although the film production and acting is wonderful for its time, I was deeply disappointed in the historical inaccuracies of this film. Not only does the story vaguely follow the correct timeline of events, but so much of historical facts are left out that I felt cheated. I think Beatty did a fantastic job in his portrayal of Clyde, but I couldn't help but think the casting of Dunaway was made in error. Yes, she is a fine actress, but at their deaths, Clyde was 24 years old and Bonnie was 23. I couldn't help but notice how much older Dunaway appears in the film in comparison to Beatty. Even the smallest details of their lives were either left out or misrepresented unfortunately."
5,Great Movie,"Great Movie, I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a great hit. I actually had my teenage kids watch it with me, they even liked it. For an older movie, it really is great. And pretty historically correct, from what I've read. Warren Beaty and Faye Dunaway do an awesome job as Bonnie & Clyde. A+++ for us."
1,HELLO!!!?!?!?,AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS VERSION AND THE ULTIMATE EDITION IS.........?GOD I HATE THESE COMPANIES ALWAYS LAUNCHING NEW AND IMPROVED SPECIAL EDITIONS AFTER ANOTHER...AND GUESS WHAT!!!! THE TWO DISC SPECIAL EDITION AND THE 2 DISC ULTIMATE EDITION ARE COMING OUT THE SAME DAY!!!!!!!!!!!1 I DONT UNDERSTAND....COULD SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN?!! AND THE LATTER IS APPROX 12 DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE! i really dont get this...this is the last straw....2 special editions on the same day? this is unbelievable
1,Methvin,"Wow, still at the top of the AFI's top 100 and it is completely false. I am Ryan Methvin. The writers of this screenplay should be ashamed."
2,kind of slow.they need to speed it up.,"this movie was so bloody at the end,they made the r rating!this was the first movie they ever rated r.the flaw is its very slow as compared to todays action packed extravagansas.a modern day version would be awesome.actualy,there is teenage bonnie and kleptomaniac clyde.its better than this one.everbody knows the story.theres these 2 lovers bonnie parker and clyde barrow.they ride around robbing banks.they become something of folk heros.the feds used a dastardly trick to lure them to their slaughter.lex luthor from superman is in it.oh yeah hes this jewish guy.......................gene hackman?its considered a classic.it is very much true.it was not exact with any books i read,but the important stuff goes down the same way.its called a classic but ive turned it off a number of times.legend in its time,i guess.the end scene is intense.the superman movies were better as mostly every hackman movie sucks."
5,ULTIMATE set details,"This is from DVDActive website:""An Ultimate Collector's Edition will also be available for $39.92. This will include all the above features [meaning those included in the 2-disc Special Edition: As well as a remastered presentation from the original elements, this new release will include a History Channel Documentary - Love and Death: The Story of Bonnie and Clyde, a 3-part Making of Bonnie and Clyde (Bonnie and Clyde's Gang, The Reality and Myth of Bonnie and Clyde, and Releasing Bonnie and Clyde), Warren Beatty Wardrobe Tests, deleted scenes (The Road to Mineloa, and Outlaws), and trailers.], along with a 36-page hardcover book of rare, behind-the-scenes photos, a 24-page reproduction of the original 1967 press book and a special mail-in poster offer.""If you want to see the artwork for the Ultimate set, go there:[...]"
4,Oh When Will a 2-Discs Set of this CLASSIC be available?,"Warner Bros. is doing a magnificent job at releasing their classics in restore fashion on special feature laden DVD Special Editions, but why no Bonnie and Clyde, yet? Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway should at least take a days worth of time out of their schedules and give their attention to the movie that put cemented their places in Hollywood (and if at all possible a SE of Network with a commentary from Dunaway would be great!!!!)."
5,CLASSIC!,"This movie is definitely one of the best ever made. No matter how many artistic liberties were taken in portraying Bonnie and Clyde, this movies is a true classic!"
3,Models gone wild,"For the first half of this film, it's just pretty to look at. Dunaway and Beatty are just too pretty for words even if the acting is questionable. I was amazed to find out that Estelle Parson won an Oscar for her portrayal of Blanche (the only member to live to a ripe old age.) Parson just runs around screaming--annoyingly so. Still the film manages to entertains and in the end that's all that counts."
4,A good crime movie with a great ending,"This a very enjoyable film as long as you don't think too hard about it. It is your classic 70's campy feeling film about a couple of Brigands. (Its okay to take off and go on a crime spree because of the Great Depression and those nasty banks)But if you stop and think about it, the trail of destruction and death they left behind them, you sober up real fast. That is why I always like the ending with the ambush of these two. Frankly they deserved it in real life. Altogther a great cast and a great movie."
5,THE BEST DAMN MOVIE ON THE PLANET,"This is the best movie ever in my opinion.It is the one that made Faye Dunaway my favorite actress and it is the movie that renewed my interest in movies.I like the action,excitement,and sexual appeal.But,there is one thing that makes the ending really cool.After the shooting stops,just play Dream On by Aerosmith and you'll see it really enhances the ending.I hope this was helpful.So if you're in the mood for a movie with sex,violence,action,excitement,and tons of gore,this is the movie to watch.It's an oldie but a goodie!"
4,Movie,Was delivered on time. Son loves the movie. He has watched it over and over. Ha was very happy to get this as a Christmas present
3,"I expected more from this video, but it was OK.","I really would to express all my feelings regarding this video, but I must go play B-ball now. Thank you and bye."
2,only ok,"Please keep in mind this is not part of the A&E Biography series, this is a movie. From the beginning, movies have always, I repeat, always taken liberty with facts. So unlike some earlier reviews, I was not disappointed that the movie skipped some facts. But I was disappointed in the movie itself. The critics have built this movie into one of ""The Great Ones"". Yes, the movie is rich in the technical areas, but I don't think the movie could decide whether to glorify them or to demonstrate how self destructive and crime obsessed they were. It was all I could do to finish the move."
2,This Is Art,"Mr. Bonesteel characterized this movie as art. I'd have to agree with that because art is entirely subjective. However, his statement about these two hoods being heroes to the people at the time is not accurate (more misinformation from the movie). B&C rarely robbed banks. In fact, they robbed mom-and-pop stores and stole people's cars. A couple of times Clyde killed ""pop"" in the process. This killing of innocents, as well as law enforcement, did not endear them to the public."
4,Adult age audience,Great cast. Well written script. Reasonably accurate historically. Enjoyed seeing the variety of late 1920s and early 1930s automobiles. Recommended.
4,Wild Couple,Bonnie & clyde is a good movie about the real Bonnie & Clyde the wild couple that would live there life on the rode breaking the law from murder to Robberies
5,Buy This CD! It's FABULOUS!,"Anne Cochran is a hidden gem of a singer! Luckily, she's getting more national exposure now as Jim Brickman's vocalist, as she should! Her velvety alto voice soars, roars and purrs on this strong C.D. ""Lucky Girl"" is so great, I'm hard-pressed to pick my top five! Get it! I think you'll agree. She's on her way to fame."
1,Not worth it,"Working as a fortune teller and psychic I like to buy various decks of cards that I come across. Particularly interesting to me are the ""Gypsy"" or ""LeNormand"" style cards. Upon seeing this book and deck set in a local bookstore I decided to purchase it hoping that it would have a bit of detail about the interpretation of LeNormand style cards, or at the very least how to interpret regular playing cards.This is anything but. It's a cheaply made deck of playing cards (I can buy poker cards of higher quality for $2.00!) The book is simply one where you ask your question and look up the answer next to the corresponding card. No interpretation, no predicting, just a nonsense answer with little relevance."
1,Not at all what I expected,"First off the set is used. The book looks like it was chewed on by a small rodent and it reeks like stale cigarette smoke.The cards look like regular playing cards. The book is simply pages of questions, lame questions such as ""will my life be adventurous?""Seriously disappointed & will be requesting a full refund."
3,Not worthy,"I have been a big TMBG fan since... forever. I preorded this disc a while ago, and it showed up an hour ago. My initial analysis of this is that it should be in the collection of a die-hard TMBG fan, but it is not great. A lot of tribute albums are more enjoyable to listen to than the originals straight through. However, this is not the case for this one. Get this if you have an Amazon Gift Certificate to spend, but don't spend your hard earned cash on it."
4,Book Review,This is a very good reference. I plan to use it often as I explore and delve into my family history.
2,Disappointed,"This CD was so highly rated that I couldn't wait to receive it. When it came, I was extremely disappointed. My niece (of whom I have custody) is struggling with her math facts for school, a necessary promotion standard, and we really need help, but she hates the songs, and quite frankly, so do I. I thought they'd be fun and catchy, but they are cheesey and tedious. The ""Hip-Hop"" claim is quite questionable. . . . We also purchased Schoolhouse Rock, and it is by far a better investment. Unfortunately, when buying a cd online, it is almost impossible to preview the songs, and so my recommendation is to check out your local music store first to make sure that the music is a match for your child."
5,"A little bit celtic, and a little bit rock and roll","Carbon Leaf's best offering to date, Ether is a great addition to the collection of anyone who likes the Pogues, Son Volt, Waterboys, Wilco, etc. Rootsy in an Appalachian way, but from a band that still has all of its teeth, Ether features music with twang and a certain smack. Favorite tracks are Home and Ordinary Eyes."
3,Does the job,Very happy with this kettle. I just wish the heating element was lower so you can actually boilb just one cup when one cup is all you need.
4,One of the Last Well Made Electric Kettles,The large K4070 removes from the stand and makes for easy use.Its a great Kettle and will last a long time.The smaller models are flimsy and poorly built.
1,The plastic stinks,"This brand new kettle - after having been cleaned, descaled with vinegar (at Proctor Silex's suggestion), filled with a solution of water and baking soda (at Proctor-Silex's suggestion) reeks of a chemical, plastic smell, which it imparts to any water boiled in it.We're returning it immediately. Feh."
3,Do not immerse!,"Works well (and fast) but if you get the base element wet by immersing or even a few drops of water, the unit fails. Even wiping electrical connection with a damp (not wet)cloth ruins the machine. This aspect of design could be better. Fortunately, it's inexpensive to replace."
1,R.I.P.,"I bought this kettle in February 2006. I liked everything about it until its automatic ON-OFF switch died recently - only two months after the purchase. Now the kettle won't turn on. It wasn't abused in any way, and these kettles usually last for years and years. The last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new Proctor Silex K4070.I wonder if my bad experience with this kettle was unique? Has anyone else had one with a short-lived switch, or was I unlucky?"
1,You need a giants hand to handle; the strenght of Stallon to pick up; precise vision to get it back on its cradle correctly,It's too big; if you fill it to capacity it's difficult to lift with just one hand but then the handle is so large in itself that if you have small hands or even just average size hands of a fermale it is akward to hold; then getting it back on its cradle is not easy if you don't have it aimed just right to get it onto the plate.
5,I use this every day,"Actually, I often use this several time a day. Tea, coffee, oatmeal, I even use it for hot water when I'm cleaning my disposal!"
3,It does the job,"It works. However, it is quite slow in heating up: if the element is cold, it take about 4 and a half minutes to heat up 1 liter of water. If the element is hot (so after making one batch), it still takes about 2 and a half minutes to heat up 1 liter of water."
2,Works great -- just dies at an early age,This is the second kettle we have purchased. The first lasted about 9 months and then quit working. The second died today at the ripe age of 7 months. Unit works great -- when it works. Hard to believe that you could produce something as simple as an immersion heater in a pot and have it go defective so quickly.
5,fantastic deal,"It arrived on time andso far has worked even better than I hoped for, takes no time at all to heat the water."
3,Great until now!,"I bought this kettle about 2 years ago and loved it all the way (well priced too). Boiled fast, safe for kids, liked the design, did not even taste the plastic. Then about a week ago is stopped working. I tried to 'rest it a bit' (that's what I do first when things break, sometimes they fix themselves) but looks like it died. That's for the tree stars, a kettle should last longer, otherwise it would get four star. I still liked it and wanted to order another one, but now I'm concerned about the plastic leaching into water. Searching for stainless and so far have not found any match in price and quality...."
1,does not shut off automatically,"tried, tried and retried but it would not automatically shut off and kept boiling endlessly. returned product. i've owned many kettles. very disappointed. and my old one bit the dust, and they no longer carry it.. .bummed."
4,LOVE THE KETTLE,i PURCHASED THIS FOR MY SON AND WIFE LIVING IN THE US. iT APPEARS THAAT KETTLES ARE NOT COMMON IN THE US SO THEY ARE THRILLED TO RECEIVE THIS ONE
5,Proctor Silex Electric Kettle,Purchased as a gift. It has a large easy grip handle making it a great product for anyone but is especially great for an elderly person.
4,Works as it should.,"Heats quickly, not overly noisy, works as expected. There was no plastic smell to the water. There is a minimum amount of water required to operate the kettle, but it's not a big problem."
3,Just So So,The magnets would not stay attached to the front of my grill. I cabled tied to the frame to stay put. Would not recommend for outdoor usuage.
2,Sliding hold,"Ok..if I had read the reviews I would not have bought. I have a textured refrigerator and the things just keep sliding down, but only on 1 side. It doesn't matter if I put something on them or leave them empty. So like the other reviewer this didn't work for me. I am going to try and purchase stronger magnets and see if I can fix them. I like the look and it's what I wanted...too bad they didn't work."
5,This works great!!!,"I read the reviews and to the ones that wrote that the magnets weren't strong enough I can only say ""What the heck were you trying to put on them?"" I received mine today and put it straight to work. The magnets were very strong and stuck firmly to my refrigerator, which has a textured finish by the way. I hung utensils and dishcloths and aprons on it and it stuck like glue. It saved space in a space challenged kitchen and looks good while doing it. 5 stars from me. I'll order more for friends who have the same issues."
3,Not a strong magnet,"I bought this in order to hang my grill tools from the metal front panel on my grill. I dont have tools that are exceptionally heavy, but the magnet slides down the metal panel when I put more than just the grill fork on the rack. I made it work but having everything just barely touch the ground and then it doesnt slide all the way down."
2,Two cloth aprons are too much for it.,"Looks great. The construction seems good too. It is really a shame that two, empty cloth aprons drag it down to the floor. Otherwise I would love it."
5,Better Houseware magnetic hook rack,"I am limited for space in cupboards, countertops and wall space. This is convient for me for extra places to put hot pads, measuring cups/spoons. etc. Magnet is very strong."
4,"Nice, But Needs Stronger Magnets","I love the item, it's just what I wanted. The rack kept slipping once I placed the utensils on it. I had to go to Home Depot to get a few additional magnets to resolve the problem. Otherwise, it's nice!"
5,Works Great,Hi. Got this item for my kitchen and thought I would use it on the metal panel over my stove since so many of the reviews stated it doesn't hold on textured refrigerators (which I have). I found out the back of my stove is plastic and not metal so I tried the fridge. It holds great. Not sure what all the comments about it falling off a textured fridge are about but in my experience it holds nice and strong. I love it.
5,Magnetick Hook Rack,Love this product! Holds things really well. My daughter has one and I loved hers so bought one for myself.
3,Magnets don't hold 3+ utensils,"With 3-5 lightweight utensils, this rack started drooping down my fridge. The way the magnets are glued in, they don't seem to make 100% contact with the surface of the fridge. Looks nice, though, and I'll keep it. I put two other magnets directly under it to help stabilize."
2,Most Likely Not What You're Looking For,"This set of magnetic hooks will not work on textured metal surfaces. I bought it to use on my Fridge (with a textured surface) and with any weight at all it just slides to the floor. I bought a set of individual ""rare earth"" magnet hooks that are 1/4 the size of the magnets on this thing and each of them will hold four-times the weight (for less than 1/3 the money for 8 hooks). If you are looking to mount this on a smooth surface it MIGHT work, but I wouldn't take the chance if I were you."
5,It works!,"Ordered before I read reviews on magnets not working very well on textured surfaces - resigned myself to giving this away since it probably was going to slide down the fridge when fully loaded - but it didn't! Although it may not hold a lot of heavier items, it's working perfectly well for my purposes (several metal utensils and pot holders)."
4,Perfect for outside,"I bought these hooks to use on my stainless steel grill to hold my utensils while I'm grilling, and it works perfectly. The magnets are nice and strong so they have no problem holding onto my heavy metal tongs, spatula, and other accessories. The stainless steel finish is also holding up to being outside in the Florida weather, no rust or discoloration."
3,A useful read,i only gave it three stars because many of the stories were more about patriotism than about the war themselves. Of course every book has its bias so its still a useful and moving read when taken with this grain of salt.
5,A memorable and heart-rending read!!,"After reading this I now realize why my father will not talk about his WW2 experiences in any detail. Anyone who can read this book without getting a lump in their throat or tears in their eyes has no heart. It makes me so thankful for those who went before, and so sincerely sad for those families who experienced the loss of children and fathers. It is a profoundly moving collection which should be required reading in every history class in the world, not just in the US. Deeply recommended."
5,A love letter to the USA,"While this book is entitled ""War Letters"" it is actually a love letter to every United States citizen. The men and women who authored the letters within had no idea at the time what the future would bring, many were confused and most were scared. But they knew that what they were doing would make the world a better place for those to come.Andrew Carroll has done an amazing job. I don't know how he could have chose what to include or what to quote. I do know though, that every American should read this book and thank the men and women who have contributed."
5,Incredible and honest,"If you are looking for purity and truth from the people who lived and died in the atrocities of war this book tells it like it was. I cried when reading the accounts of the men describing their desperation of loneliness, fear and courage. I treasure it."
1,Back to the drawing board with this one.,"While $2.00 is not a lot of money, this poorly produce, scattered collection of appropriated ideas was confusing--both a waste of time and money. Maybe more so because there's potentially a decent argument within, that I watched, and waited for way longer than necessary. There is no purpose within many scattered speculations. Ironic, isn't it that in light of its name, it fails to connect any dots? The author seems to be exploiting too many good ideas by others, and any reasonable thinker's patience."
1,Poor editing and review,"I received this book yesterday. I am on page 49, and I have already sent in 7 submissions for the errata, all of it code mistakes. BTW, the errata is not posted on the website.This is my first time trying to tackle MonoDevelop, but have been programming with VS and C# for several years now. I also own several Apress books.I have serious doubts about how someone new to the field could actually learn from this book with so many mistakes.I will try and forge on to the end of this book, but it is seriously hurting my brain!"
4,Nice FM Tuner for Ipods,"The Griffin iFM is the ideal FM tuner for Ipods, especially the black colored ones. It has good FM reception and good sound quality, the built-in 6 presets and 3 bands (Japan, USA, Europe) are very useful for international travelers. It is almost perfect if not for the 2 small gripes, the small equalizer button is very hard to push and the earphone plug dongle gets easily tangled with the other wire, which should be built-in in the first place. Other than those, the iFM is a good tuner and has the bonus feature as a wired remote controller."
2,Buyer Beware!,"In spite of the product description, this will not work as a wired remote for the ipod 3G. The radio works but you might feel a bit silly hauling around a $200+ ipod to serve as a battery for a radio. There has got to be a better way!Griffin iFM (Dock Connector) / FM Radio and Wired Remote Control for iPod"
1,Worst purchase ever.,"I don't know what happened with this product, I coudn't believe that I even paid for this. It didn't work at all. the cable seemed to be loose or something it was always interfered signal i coudn't hear clearly, i coudn't catch a signal, I even gave it a chance in another country hoping it would had to do with radio signal frequency or something but it just didn't work. I tried to open it to fix it, like a said it seemed to be broken or something but it just never worked not even as a remote control, the buttons where like glued, it was a nightmare."
3,At the gym,"I was trying to get the TV sound at the gym on my I-pod touch. I found out that the wireless headphones as seen on TV work. I just take my headphones without the tower and I am good to go. I was really afraid Someone would talk because there's nothing plugged into anything. This product worked fine the one time I used it but I like my headphones better.Seller was great, fast shipping, no problems with seller."
2,Spoke too soon,spoke too soon its been alil over 2 weeks and its broken already the remote shuts off by itself then cuts back on and now i can only hear through one ear theres a loose connection in the wires
2,cheap,"seems poorly made, & the volume doesn't get as loud as your ipod usually could (without this). it's okay if you listen to talk FM i guess."
2,Just doesn't work well enough to bother,"On the positive side, the physical design and contruction are excellent. However, setting and changing the playback stations is so tedious and time consuming that I have to give low marks to features and ease of use. Worse, the effort does not pay off. I tried the unit in a VW Jetta, Jeep Liberty, Honda CRV and Toyota Corolla and was never able to get acceptable sound. Radio static is the main problem, but compared to FM stations, the dynamic range is very short, with clipped high and rumbling lows. Noise that the car radios do not usually pick up, like from power lines and vehicle ignitions, is amplified. The experience is like listening to a cheap AM car radio from the 1950s. My Griffin iFM dock is in the trash because I can't give it away."
1,iFM - Griffin,"The first one of these I recieved fell apart the very first time I tried to use it. I requested an RMA number from the supplier, but they were nice enough to send me a new one with out any pushback or need for explaination. I would rate the company as 5 Stars but the product as 1."
1,Griffin iFM,"Functionally, the iFM is great. I like to use it for workouts at the gym to watch FM transmitted TV's. However, the construction is extremely cheap. I bought two of them and both fell apart. One fell apart the second time I used it. The construction is so cheap that I couldn't put it back together because the controls don't line up. I wish there was an alternative but I can't find one. I like being able to switch between iPod tunes and FM, but will have to carry two devices from now on."
4,Black iFM = No Recorder,"I haven't purchased this item yet, but buyers should be aware that the black version does not offer recording capabilities. If you go to the griffin technologies website, the black iFM is listed under iFM Dock (the other major difference being that this version uses the dock connector instead of the extended headphone port). iFM Dock is a ""Radio and Remote for Ipod."" So despite the product description on amazon, there is no recorder on this version.That being said, I plan to give this gadget a shot so that I can listen to the radio while at the gym. I'm hoping this version won't have the problems with the casing that some reviewers have cited, but only time will tell.PS: There is an excellent review of both models at iLounge."
3,Don't see the point,"I bought the iFM to use with my new Nano. The only relationship it has with the Ipod is to use it for power. When you plug this into the Ipod, you now have 2 separate devices to carry; the Ipod does not even have to be on for the iFM to work. Ipod really needs to add the FM tuner because having to add a device like the iFM is ridiculous. It would be better to just use another device with FM rather than lugging around an Ipod just to power up this other device."
2,I have used it for a week and the cord is already coming apart!,I am sooooo returning this piece of junk. Didn't even last a week of regular use. Cord is coming apart at the connectors.
2,Misleading,"I bought this specifically to transmit iPod music to my car's FM radio. The product description leads one to believe that this is what the product does. IT DOES NOT. It is an FM receiver, not a transmitter.Luckily the seller gave me a full refund."
3,I don't own this...but consider these other options,"I have both an iPod Nano and Sandisk Sansa e250. If you don't already own an iPod but is thinking of getting one along with this iFM Radio, consider this:Cost of iPod+FM = $145+$36=$181Cost of Sansa = $107The Sandisk (or even the Zen or the new Samsung) has many more features (MP3 player, Photo viewer, Video player, Voice recorder, FM Radio and MicroSD memory expansion slot) for much less money. I must admit, the iPod is definitely more sexy and more user friendly. I just wish Apple wouldn't get too greedy and instead integrate the FM Radio feature in the next release of iPods."
4,MP3 Solution,"Yeah, it's cool, that's why I bought it. And I was hot when it wouldn't play any of my MP3s that play fine everywhere else. It turns out that it has something to do with the fact that later versions of Lame, the MP3 algorithm used by the DBPowerAmp Music converter I use, does something funny that the Sony can't read. I went out and got the Blade converter, and reburned the CD's, and everything works fine. Do a search in Google on ""Not MP3 Sony zs-x3cp"" and you are on your way to a solution. If I hadn't had to go through this, the Sony would have gotten 5 stars..."
2,Worst AC plug design ever - portable NOT!,"I bought this unit for my daughter for Christmas after seeing it at Target - great styling, ok+ sound quality and features - BUT - be aware that Sony designed this product with a HUGE AC power brick transformer rather than with an internal transformer - measures 3.25"" x 2.25"" x 2"" and weighs a ton. We are returning the unit because we use the AC power much more than batteries - we can't imagine lugging this brick with us everywhere! Too bad because we liked everything else about it."
2,Should have read the others' reviews,"Bought this unit because it was a good price and really wanted a portable MP3 boombox. It should not be called a boombox, as it certainly is incapable of booming. I work in a fairly noisy production area, and only can hear this player by being next to it, a problem I think is due to being strictly a 9-volt system. Also, like all the other reviews, the MP3 loves to screech on the slightest hint of haze or dust, much more on an honest scratch or fingerprint. Embarassing. Wish I'd bought another selection, but the design is nice."
2,Mp3 does not work that well,Purchased this unit a couple of weeks ago and had to send it back. First of all the sound was only so-so. I was not too surprised since the speakers are of an average quality but i have heard better from similar speakers.The unit has a 10sec buffer for antiskip which was nice except when it came to playing my mp3 CD's it would skip the first 10sec of the track and start playng with the counter starting from zero. I tried several mp3 encoded CD's and they all did it even though they CD's would work fine on my Riovolt SP250. The replacement unit did the same as well.Close but no cigar!
2,if you want mp3 support go elsewhere,"Sure it's a cool design. Overall it even sounds ok. I tried 2 units because I really wanted it to work but the mp3 playback was horrible. Random screeching sounds were very common and note the word random (it isn't my disk). I returned it and bought a mp3 boombox for half the price and it works great. It doesn't look as cool and unfortunately it doesn't get quite as loud. However, it is playing my mp3's perfectly and that is what I really wanted. Good luck with it."
2,Wayy overpriced,"I found a deal on this one at a local store. Compared it against many other Sony products and other brands as well. This had a horribly small tinny sound. For the price, I would expect more, although this plays mp3s. The sony cfd-s20cp sounded somewhat better and is much cheaper. The cfd-s20cp doesn't look as nice, but then again this zs-x3cp looks kindof dumb to me. And it has a cheapy feel to it, which is probably partly because it is lightweight (transformer is in plug and not the actual device).I didn't like the button layout either, but I haven't seen anyone do a very good job on this yet. It's ironic that car stereos have one heck of an intuitive layout in about 10 square inches, and Sony can only make it worse when the real estate on top of the unit grows by 10x over the car stereo.If you are set on paying this much for a boombox, I would suggest JVC RC-BM5 or . If you want the same device for less, I would suggest sony cfd-s20cp."
1,"Sleek looking, but ......","This unit claims to play MP3 discs, but it would not read the home-computer created CD-R or CD-RW MP3 discs that I have no trouble playing on either my Rio portable or Pioneer DVD players. I took some sample discs to a Circuit City store and tried them out unsuccessfully on a display model. Allowing for the possibility of a defective or broken display, I went to a second Circuit City store and got the same results there. They had a store-copy, commercially produced (by MP3.com) sample disc that worked just fine, but none of my Roxio or Adaptec burned CD-Rs or CD-RWs had any function. So, if you like creating your own MP3 compilation discs, and you're looking for a portable box unit that will play them --- this one's NOT for you!Also, there are no tone controls or equalizer pre-sets to choose from on this player. Except for the bass boost, one sound setting fits all."
1,Dissapointment,I have two complaints.1. I was completely unsatisfied with MP3 playback. Long Load times and a terrible shuffle contributed to this problem. I bought the player for mp3 cds and after the first week I wasnt even using them.2. After owning the player for six months and never putting it through a high stress environment CDs stopped working. The player would continue to play on low volumes but at normal volumes the player turned off after 15-20 seconds.
2,Oops I almost got caught - I returned this item!,"This amplifier sounds good and has lots of connectors at the back - download the pdf manual from sonystyle and see for yourself.My main complaint about this product and why I returned it was that as soon one begins to listen to a digital audio signal - whether that be from your satelite box or your DVD player - this amplifier will no longer play any analog audio, it shuts off any output to the ""zone 2"", ""monitor"", ""video 1"" and video 2"" outputs - so you can't send the sound out to any analog component that you may have, such as: cordless head phones, a video recorder, another amplifier, back to your TV (essential if your TV uses DVI or component inputs). This product just makes no sense - don't waste your money - the SONY engineers were really asleep at the wheel."
4,Great workout!,"I feel this video is very helpful and easy to understand. Most videos of this nature are usually setting a pace way too fast for someone who is overweight. If a person really wants to lose weight they need to be able to do the excercises on the tape, not get feed up and throw it away. This tape is very good for that reason. And i like kickboxing."
5,great kickboxing workout,after using this video for 2 weeks I lost 5 pounds.I enjoy doing the workout expecially when it is only 30 minutes long. That means a lot when you have a toddler. I have toned up a lot of unwanted fat. You can't go wrong with this video. Anybody can do it.
4,Great 30-min workout!,"I really liked this video! I feel like I can either go high impact or tone it down alittle. The instructor gives a good, solid base to work from. She is clear and enthusiastic, which makes it interesting. Yes! I am very satisfied with the tape,it's a great addition to my fitness plan. Thanks Donna!! Susan"
1,don't waste your time,"I thought this video was not very challenging. I expected an advanced workout, and when the video was finished I thought we were just finishing the warm up. Also, the instructor obviously has taught many aerobics classes because her kickboxing form was horrible. I didn't even break a sweat. This is a very, very beginning level tape."
3,Great acting by Heard,I would rate this a medium rating. The movie was OK but nothing to rave about. I did enjoy the acting of John Heard.
5,Classic baltimore blocks,"Contains 95 patterns in one book, value for money these days. Black and white patterns though."
3,Lacking Color Examples,I am new to Baltimore Album Blocks and was disappointed that there were no sample color blocks provided in the book at all. I would recommend this book only to those well versed in Baltimore Album blocks who don't need to see pictures of blocks for guidance on color selection.
5,Baltimore Quilts,"The book is full of wonderful Baltimore applique designs, but for people like me who do not have the know how and knowledge of applique it could be frustrating. There are no instructions at all, I have purchased the Baltimore Beauties and Beyond Vol 1 book as I am told this has many instructions for the Applique patterns featured in The Best Of Baltimore Beauties."
5,Wonderful Addition to the Baltimore Collection,"Purchased this book in my search for some original Baltimore patterns. I already have the ""Best of Baltimore Beauties II' and had been searching for the first book. The patterns in this book are not duplicates of the Part II, but some do sometimes appear similar but with subtle differences. Overall, I would say the vast majority of the patterns are unique to this book. The one thing this book does not contain are color photos of the patterns. I found this disappointing but not of such consequence that it impacted the patterns, only my desire to see the work in color.There is the same history as in Part II of each block's design which is helpful and informative. There is also an addition to this book of several 'Baltimore' style designs but with a modern twist. This book is an excellent to any Baltimore collection and will inspire you with the detail and devotion required to complete one of these album quilts so many years ago."
4,Book for an experienced quilter with a collection of other Sienkiewicz books,"I am an experienced quilter who loves Elly Sienkiewicz style of quilts, and owns a number of her books. I enjoyed this book, and already done a project inspired by the ideas presented in this book.This book is aimed an experienced quilter who owns ""Baltimore Beauties and Beyond"", her first book in this series. Many of the projects in this book reference her first book for detailed instructions. This book will not teach you how to do it, it is the source for inspiration and ideas.So given my background I enjoyed this book, however it might be frustrating if this is the first book by Elly Sienkiewicz that you have purchased."
2,Book,"I was disappointed. As a new quilter, I have been looking forward to doing a Baltimore albumn quilt. The book keeps refering to previous books and lessons to learn how to use the patterns, but does not attempt to explain or assist the reader in any way. I do not own any previous books so this one leaves me cold. Not recommended for new quilters like myself."
2,Where are the color pictures?,I'm disappointed there are no color photos of quilts to show these patterns.
5,The Best of Baltimore Beauties: 95 Patterns for Album Block,"This is an excellent book for all fans of applique quilting. I've looked through almost all of Elly Sienkiewicz's previous books but have never yet purchased any of them. I'm glad I waited for this book. It really does contain some of the best designs by Ms. Sienkiewicz. Probably not for beginning quilters as the focus is on the patterns and not technique, but the experienced applique artist will enjoy the many challenging blocks. It's definitely a great addition to my quit library!"
3,You need her other book.,"I found lots of patterns in this book. Great! However, all the pictures are in black and white and are taken from her other books. She tells us which OTHER books contain the instructions. In other words, buy ""Baltimore Beauties and Beyond"". You will get much more out of it."
2,Baltimore review,"Although there are many patterns and pictures, none are in color and most refer the reader back to Volume 1, Lesson #.....Good for ideas, but difficult to complete if you don't own the previous volume."
2,Just generic,Sophisticated teenmo lumbers under its own limitations in feeble attempts at melodic engagement.
1,Don't waste your money,"I do not want to insult any of the other reviewers, but they must be personal friends of the author. This was a useless book as well as a waste of my money. I purchased it specifically because it professed to give a black perspective on Paris. You could do better researching on the internet yourself. As a travel book of any kind, it was a poor excuse. Do not waste your money. Purchase a traditional travel guide for a lot less and a lot more info."
1,Not worth it!!,"If (and that's a BIG IF) this suuuper-slim book(let) contains any unique kernels of information, they are certainly not worth your hard-earned $20. The price is especially ridiculous when you consider that there are books three times as thick, with glossy photos and a real wealth of information about Paris overall, that cost less even before any discounts. I was sorely, sorely disappointed in this book, and I am returning it first thing Monday morning. I turned around and bought the Eyewitness guide instead, which gave me some real insight into Paris as a whole, and then for that black/African-American/African angle, I did some research on the Internet, which led me to find out about the Goutte d'Or neighborhood and various restaurants of interest.As much as I griped about the price, I think even if this book were priced in the $7 - $10 range, I would still give it one star or at the most, two stars. There is simply not enough information in here for it to be much of a guide at all."
1,Be Happy!,The book I ordered from Amazon: The Be Happy Attitudes by Robert SChuller arrived in good time but I was disappointed when I opened it as it was so old that the pages were all yellow and ugly. I was ashamed to give it to a friend to read. It was not worth the price plus postage that I paid.
2,too much of a hassle - didn't fit,"Did not fit in my condo chimney, nor did it fit in my parents house chimney. So had to return it after making a mess. A great idea but unfortunately, didn't work out for me :(Positive: the company really did try to help me trouble shoot and gave me a refund."
3,A Bargain at Twice the Price,"Wow, I can't begin to express my amazement. We finally have a reasonably priced edition of Sir Francis Bacon's latter writings. Who would have thought it would take 400 years for the price to come down to $300? Of course, it is a classic, and you pay for quality."
2,Beautiful but it fell apart,"My husband gave me this necklace for my first Mother's Day since the birth of my son. Unfortunately, the cameo fell out of it only about 3 months after I recieved it! It's completely lost. I almost cried because it really is a beautiful piece. My suggestion is that if you buy this check it often or perhaps even see if a jewelry shop can reinforce the setting for you."
5,Thanks for all of your help !!!!!!,"Melanie,Thank you for all of your help with getting me the cookbook. It is in such amazing condition. It will bring so much joy to all of us a Christmas when we make the special recipes out of it."
3,boys and girls cookbook,The book is great but the was a missing page. Had one like it when I was growing up and wanted my Grandkids to learn to make things from stratch instead of from a box. This book helped me learn and I know it will help them learn to.
5,A great help to me,I was recently given this book by a friend. It was just what I needed to help me look at prayer in a new way. I was taught to pray by my grandmother many many years ago--but this is something entirely different. She would have liked it too!
1,Not worth it,"Very low budget, poorly acted film. Unrealistic ending as thyroid cancer is not as portrayed. Sorry I wasted my 1.99. Just awful!"
4,Good mystery . . ..,"Not as complex as some of Christie's mysteries, but still a good read. Once you read a little bit, you'll read until the mystery is solved."
3,A 3-Star Agatha Christie,"This one fell a bit flat. The observant Ms. Marple, seeming out of place in the Caribbean and somewhat bored on her vacation, fortuitously gets a puzzle to solve from stock character Major Palgrave. Could it be murder?For another Caribbean mystery, tryMurder in the Raw: A Rex Graves Mystery (Rex Graves). It's a fast-paced, contemporary Agatha Christie set at an exclusive resort in the French West Indies--by C.S. Challinor, author of CHRISTMAS IS MURDER."
3,MEDIOCRE,"If this is your first Christie buy, don't do it. This is a story with a potential interest level but a mediocre turn-out. A somewhat slow read, something certain to give you a bad taste of Christie."
4,A GOOD BEACH READ TO TAKE ON YOUR CARIBBEAN VACATION,"This is another enjoyable Agatha Christie novel. It's the first Miss Marple book I've read so I don't have other Marple's to compare it to. I guess Christie corner invented the market of quiet murders solved by plucky women of a certain age. It may not be the most macho reading in the world so don't tell anyone I enjoyed it!This is a fun, quick read about a murder on a fictional island in the Caribbean. Christie was extremely prolific so her characterizations may not have been the best. I recommend an edition with a list of characters at the beginning because, as the cast of suspects is trotted out, there is little to distinguish them at first besides their names.I enjoy Agatha Christie's books because of the window they provide on the time in which they were written. This one was written in the early sixties and Miss Marple's views on sexual mores are priceless."
3,It's OK,"As other have mentioned, if this is your first time reading AC, I would recommend Death on the Nile of Murder on the Orient Express. I got this book hoping she would make use of the Caribbean setting, unfortunately, AC really didn't get too descriptive with the setting at all. Also, I noticed she left a lot of character actions unexplained, ***Possible Spoiler, but not really***, such as why Mrs. Hillingdon had gone to the chemist one random day. I would have liked if this action were explained, not that is made a difference, but I don't like to random incidents thrown at me just for the sake of throwing me off the scent. Character development also leaves much to be desired.This book was just OK to me."
3,Very basic book.,"This book barely got into DHTML at Chapter 10. From Chapter 1-9, the author basically goes through basic HTML concepts. The DHTML information was very basic and dry. There was a handful of printing errors. You'll definitely need another book to further your understanding. This book should be sufficient if you know nothing of web programming. I can probably retrieve more information off the Internet if necessary!"
2,poor quality,"The books looks so so for dummeis who just starts creating web pages. Unfortunately it fails to deal with the major issues on dhtml. There are better materials online such as Danstein ,siteexpert and Webference. If you prefer the printed material, try the Danny Goodman's Dynamic HTML the Definite Guide'."
4,Essential Dynamic HTML,I think that this is a good book for you to read if you are trying to start out.
3,"Slow down, Mr B!","I love these Beethoven sonatas, but I /do/ wish Mr Barenboim had played the fast passages a little bit slower, so I could hear all the notes. It is fashionable these days for many performers to play fast passages at lightning speed, but if that were all that is necessary, the recording studio has the means, these days, to speed up the recording to any speed and adjust the pitch back to the original, as is done in advertising commercials.That said, the slower movements are beautifully handled. Three and a half stars."
4,awesome!,"I bought this for my son for his first winter and it continues to run very well with little maintenance 2 years later. The germ-free and mold-free factors were really important to us and there's even indicator lights to tell you when the UV light needs to be replaced. (We still have never had to do this). Filters rarely need replacement and are easy to replace. With both tanks filled the humidifier will easily run for two days without needing a refill and the heat shuts off when the tanks are empty. The tanks are made so they don't leak and fit in a kitchen sink easily. The only annoying thing about it has been that the tanks are difficult to clean, but I found that using a diluted bleach solution, as opposed to just vinegar and water as the manufacturer suggests, works very well."
1,way to complicated,"I read the instructions on this product and never even took it out of the box. It requires daily maintenance, and I just don't want to spend so much of my free time fussing over a humidifier."
5,Transforming Fear into Faith!,"An amazing book that will help you get through the dark nights of the soul and emerge triumphant. Uplifting, encouraging and enlightening. A must read!"
4,Not his best work but good,I love James Allens writing and messages and thought. This is an old book and the language is written back in the day as they say. For me that made it a slow read. Difficult at times. But hidden beneath that struggle is a gem. As always his thought makes sense and is inspiring but you have to work for it in this one. But he does have a way with words and his understanding of life can make anyone better who studies his works. Good but not great.
2,Could be better,"Mr. Allen's ""As a Man Thinketh"" was probably his best piece of work and much better that this new book, ""The Life Triuphant""."
3,No excuse not being produced in 5.1!,"Although the music is good, I was very disappointed that it took until 2002 to release this DVD and it wasn't in Dolby Digital 5.1. His VHS tapes were better. Wait until they produce it in 5.1."
2,nao recebi o produto comprado com a AMAZON,POR FAVOR ME DEEM UMA ORIENTAAO POIS FIZ UMA COMPRA COM VOCES EM DEZEMBRO D 2010 E ATÉ AGORA NAO RECEBI O DVD DO BRAYAN ADAMS. INFELIZMENTE ESTOU MUITO DESCONTENTE COM AMAZON.COM MEU E-MAIL MARCIOEDD1@HOTAMIL.COM POR FAVOR ENTREM EM CONTATO COMIGO POIS NEM ISSO VCS FIZERAM. UM GRANDE ABRAO
5,Healing Wisdom,"This book is a wonderful contribution to the healing of all women. Not only in her courageous confrontation with heart disease but equally important in her willingness to tell the truth. We need more women like her. Pamela tells her story so vividly and with such aching honesty. She empowers us all to speak from the depths of our experience. And her book is an inspiration, reminding us that every experience in life, no matter how painful can be an opportunity to grow and discover more about ourselves."
4,soothing,"The CD is quiet, good listening music when in a meditative mood contains well known hymn tunes."
4,Good Basic Infomation,"This book provides a good general overview of caring for an african grey. You'll need other books that go into more depth for behavior management, etc., but this book is a good starting point. While the book is current and up to date for the most part, the author does recommend giving your parrot a nut and bolt as a toy. Surprisingly, she does not warn that you must be careful that it does not contain zinc. The nut and bolt would have to be made of stainless steel to be safe, otherwise your bird could get heavy metal poisoning."
3,African Grey,This is a very complete little book on the basic's of owning an African Grey. Very descriptive with good photos showing the differences between the varieties.
2,"Chain is a little ""too"" delicate","This is a very nice looking Tie Clip, it has a very nice ""dainty"" chain , if you move around a lot you are sure to break it. My husband broke his right as he was trying to put it on. He got it fixed though. He doesn't wear it anymore he is afraid he may break it again. I think if the chain was a little sturdier it would be a great great clip. Now if your just going to sit at a desk and not move around very much it may hold up better, or for the occassional tie wearer. But not for someone who has to get up and down out of a seat and stand all day .Other than that, the tie clip is great!"
4,A nice book of answers,"I have read quite a few questions-answer books in Chrsitian titles. This is among the better of them. I don;t know much about the author, but I found the answers interesting, and easy to understand. Most of them reasonable. The book is a good reference, and east to search through. Most questions regarding Christian Faith, that I could think of were answered fairly.Not overly complew, but a nice start for the inquisitive."
1,"Good Questions, No Answers",Sproul tried to answer age-old theoligical questions in one to two paragraphs with litle Biblical support or objectivity.
5,too many praises to print,"One of the best records I've ever owned. Hands down Augustus' best. Different than King Tubby meets the Rockers, this is not a dub album. These are beautiful instrumentals. The rythms are solid, some of the best reggae rythms I've ever heard. The bass is thick and heavy, pulsing through the tracks like a gorilla through the jungle. The drumming is tight, with the snare hitting the offbeats of the offbeats of the offbeats. The guitars chicka with that sound only found in jamaica 1972. But thats not even the beginning of the album. Augustus Pablo's playing is incredible. These simple lines just float over the rhythms, sometimes copied or played off of on the piano or organ. The arranging is great too, these are perfectly crafted songs, simple, yet never boring. This music is cheerful, moody, spiritual, and down to earth, all at once. How does he do it? I have no idea."
5,a most auspicious debut lp,"The late Augustus Pablo's innovativeness can not be stated too strongly. Whether by his use of melodica as a lead and respectable instrument, or by his adaptations of Dub music into his own unique and instantly recognizable sound, Pablo was always cutting edge.This lp, with ""King Tubby Meets Rockers Uptown,"" are excellent primers into the world of dub music, and are essential listening for any newcomer right up to the most ardent of reggae fans.Nearly 10 years have passed since I first acquired this lp, and many hundreds of listens later it is still fresh and innovative. THAT is the sign of great music, regardless of genre. How many cds can you say that about?"
2,good book,This is a good book for beginners or if you like the subject. Hypnosis and it's phenomenons are simply explained with some history on it and a wide practice. It was a very nice and easy reading with a lot of the basics for self hypnosis and hypnosis itself.
2,Just the basics,The book offers most of the basic information on hypnosis. Yet it lacks the depth that one would expect on the topic. I know many books on hypnosis and there is definitely much better stuff around. An excellent one I recently read was which offered also many excercises that are required to really learn hypnosis.
2,Wasn't Satisfied,"This book is more about how the author learned about and worked with self-hypnosis. It doesn't actually have well planned out steps to hypnotise yourself. It has a quick ""how do ya do?"" and then it goes back to the side-effects, the history of self-hypnosis, how they came to love hypnosis-I was looking for a step by step book on how to hypnotise yourself. This book didn't meet my standards. If you want a book on the history of hypnotising, or what happens when you do it wrong, or how a random author came to love hypnosis, heres a book for you!"
5,spooktacular,"the anchor bay vhs edition is the best version around made from the original negative. avoid all other versions of this public domain title such as Goodtimes, Media, Video Treasures, Viking home video, Republic and Interglobal. Also avoid the colorized atrocity of this otherwise excellent movie!!!!!"
3,Why butcher a classic?,"Im gonna try to make this shorter than my innitial review, because I already reviewed the classic video version of ""NOTLD"". First off, no extra music is needed, no extras are needed at the end of the film, and why do you need to sharpen this movies picture? Its some of the films low budget bad quality that makes it good. So, dont buy this technological mumbo-jumbo, get the classic video version."
4,DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING !!,"What more could George A. Romero fans possibly want? A new colorized version with 5.1 sound and a beautifully restored Black & White version of the 1968 cult classic ""Night of The Living Dead"" for one low price. If you don't feel like spending the big bucks for the millenium edition and in my opinion there's no need to, this edition is the way to go. The picture and sound are excellent to say the least, better than any of the inferior studio or bootleg copies out there. This 1968 cult classic from George A. Romero set the standard for horror films and raised the bar for all those who followed. It's a great effort put out by 20th Century Fox Studio and Legend Films and I'm happy to own it.DVD Features Include:*All-new color version and restored black-and-white version*Audio commentary by Mike Nelson of TV's Mystery Science Theater 3000""Separated at Death"" celebrity zombie game*Vintage horror trailers"
1,Only for those who dispise B&W,"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of my all-time favourite Horror films but it looks sooooooooo weak in colour, it takes every chill and thrill out of the film and makes it look like the SESAME STREET HALLOWEEN SPECIAL. Duane Jone's face looks like expired chocolate and the zombies look like normal people. Turn your back on this one, Horror fans and see the B&W version instead."
4,Amazon Instant Video,This is specifically for the Legends Films version. It is colorized. It looks fine on the Fire HD but i don't know about a larger screen. I was surprised because it doesn't say colorized. The movie is the same but has at least one glitch In the film. It was $4.99 so it was worth it.I will leave the actual movie review to others.
3,The Movie That Spawned The Greatest Sequels In Zombie Films,"This is the movie that started it all. I don't care if it is in black & white. This movie is a true legend. If you look in t.v. guides, you'll see three stars. You can notice a change in George A. Romero's zombies. In 'Night of the Living Dead', the zombies run after their victims. But when 'Dawn of the Dead' came out, the zombies were slow and lazy.This movie is truly excellent. There is no reason not to rent it. I used to own it, but sold it, so I can get the Collector's Editions.If you've seen 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'Day of the Dead', then rent 'Night of the Living Dead' to see how it all started."
4,"The original,all-time horror classic in great DVD transfer!","George Romero's 1968 masterpiece ""Night Of The Living Dead"" set high standards for the horror films that soon followed from TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE to HALLOWEEN to FRIDAY THE 13th,NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET,etc.This review refers to the DVD release released by Front Row Entertainment and not the shoddy Madacy version.Front Row's version of this classic has absolute great picture and sound and also includes an excellent profile on the film's director,George Romero with an entire list of Romero's filmography.No video artifacts,and distractions whatsoever on this release which makes this a must-have (at only $5.99 at Walgreen's where I bought this from!).Turn out the lights,cover up in your favorite blanket and get ready for NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD!!!!"
4,This is one creepy movie... *some spoilers*,"I'd rented the VHS a long time ago, so when I saw this (in a two pack with Kingdom of the Spiders) in the $5.88 section at Walmart, I had to pick it up. The film had a dark, eerie atmosphere, and interesting characters, who eventually turn on each other. I remembered parts of the movie from when I'd watched it on VHS, and thought that Barbara would live, but no one in the film lives, which is kinda depressing, but differs in that it doesn't have a happily-ever-after ending. The DVD transfer is adequate, and while the ONLY extra is an interactive menu with scene selection, the DVD is worth picking up if you're a true Horror fan. I would've given the movie 5 stars, but one thing about the film itself that bugs me is that Barbara is given hardly anything to do throughout most of the film. Still, I'm glad I bought it."
2,"Amazing Film, HORRIBLE edition!","I'll make this quick because people must know this before buying this horrible atrocity of a Special Edition! The new score that has been added sounds like terrible last-minute MIDI crap and the extra scenes have no relevance or point at all as they are filmed just before it was put on the dvd [I'm guessing '97?]. The extra ending actually has a character overcome being a zombie? Yeah, really stupid, I know. I recently bought a plain ordinary edition of Night of the Living Dead for 10$ or so and I recommend you just do that or get the Millenium Edition everyone is raving about. Don't fall into the trap of buying this horrible HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!! edition of a brilliant classic. Trust me on this."
5,Holed up in a house away from a world-turning-zombie,"Gritty and real, Night of the Living Dead rises up to the ranks of first-class horror. Holed up in a house away from a world-turning-zombie, survivors deal in close-quarters psychology as the outer menace presses in. There is shaded suspense, awful lumbering undead, and light/darkness trickery. In hinting at the grisly, master horror director Romero lets the viewer reveal the worst for himself. Its sequel, Dawn of the Dead, is satirically wicked and quintessential horror."

1,TERRIBLE VERSION,"This is one of the worst transfers of Night of the Living Dead I have ever seen. It looks to me like this was an old 16mm educational print that was ""reamastered"" (read re-transferred) to DVD to avoid copyright violation of re-releasing someone else's videomaster. For those who don't know, NOLTD is in public domain and these pirates are releasing the film without compensating the filmmakers for their hard work. If you want to see an excellent transfer with great extras that has been approved by the filmmakers, check out the Millennium Edition from Anchor Bay."
1,This is the re-edited version!,"The MOVIE is 5 stars.This DVD is 1 star.This is the re-edited version of the original classic. If you want the original classic them go elsewhere. If you want to see a new ""version"" - not a remastered version! - but a new ""version"" with new soundtrack, editing and scenes then this may be for you. If you want the original classic then go elsewhere to look for it!You have be warned."
3,"A classic, but not very scary","According to Wikipedia, many consider this movie to be the progenitor of the zombie character, and so it might appeal to you out of historical interest. If you've seen a more recent zombie flick though, you're not going to find this movie very scary."
3,the movie was ok......,"i first saw the movie on tv and i was all ""sweet a zombie movie"" it said the movie got 4 stars. it was in black and white and there wasent really music in it. it wasent scary. the acting was pretty good and the ending was a little weird."
3,"This Can't Really Happen, can it?","This has to be one of the scariest movies I have ever saw. I can't even look at a cemetary or a dirty person without thinking back to this movie. It scared me so much, that when I went to my cousin's house in the surburbs, I stayed up all night (the Cartoon Network is good for something). If you are easily scared, the Lion King should be making another movie."
1,Blu-Ray Review??,"Why isn't anyone reviewing the Blu-Ray ""Night of the Living Dead"" I've gone through all newest reviews not one talks about the new Blu-Ray copy. Why??"
1,Terrible,Made with a $5 budget and 5 cent actors. The script was wanting for a script. The director appeared to make up the flow of the plot as the story fumbled along.
3,night of the living sleepy pills,"I didn't care for this movie. I guess that has to due with the fact that the film looks old, and the storyline is basically the same as any other zombie movie. You will know where the plot is going without having to even see the film! It seems every zombie film has the same story direction.However, this is an older film we're talking about here, which means it can be considered one of the originators. That makes it an above average movie on my scale, but one that would be quite okay to skip."
1,Don't Be Lulled Into Buying the Forgotten Films Release,"Like every other unofficial Blu-ray release of Night, Forgotten Films product is thoroughly plagued with cropping, insofar as canceling out roughly 20% of picture of each frame. If you want proof, visit DVDBeaver.com and see the substantial difference between F.F.'s release and Elite's.Still, the Millennium DVD is the way to go. Yes, the picture might not be Blu-ray quality, but at least you're getting the full picture.SOMEONE, PLEASE GIVE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD A DECENT BLU-RAY RELEASE, FOR F*!K SAKE!!!"
3,Bootleg Blu Ray,"I have to agree with Jason Sum, this was not what I attended to buy. Everyone who is a fan of Night Of The Living Dead original movie obviously planned to get the original blu ray of it. But description didn't mention anything about it being bootleg. Case was extremely thin, far off from the original case. Video quality is acceptable but still disappointed for other reason. My advice is wait until the original blu ray is released in North America unless you looking for a cheapest and fast shipping then why not."
5,Mike Nelson Could Crack A Zombie Up!,This colorized version of the classic NOTLD cult horror film has a running commentary by Mike Nelson of MST 3K fame. This is why I bought the DVD!Mike is right on the money with his barbs and observations. I recommend a Mike Nelson/NOTLD party with your friends!
5,great new version of a classic horror film,"Great remastering job, and the color was great. Great dvd great price, get this one now."
1,I'd like to thank Elite Entertainment for the REAL version!,"This is THE biggest waste of money I have ever encountered. I hadn't seen the film since I was a kid, so I bought it hoping to see a re-enactment of my childhood memories, and it seemed that this wasn't the way I had remembered the film.So to compensate, I took a chance and bought the Elite Entertainment THX Millennium Edition of ""Night Of The Living Dead"" to see the way this classic was supposed to be.Well, to say the least I snapped this ""30th Anniversary Edition"" in half and burnt the rest of the material in protest. In short, THIS ANCHOR BAY EDITION IS THE MOST HORRIBLE PRESENTATION OF THIS CLASSIC. YOU MUST AVOID!"
1,An Unspeakable Travesty,"Every single moment of new footage and new scoring is a raging miscalculation. You're left bewildered, scratching your head, wondering how good-intentioned people could screw up so comprehensively. Get the great Elite edition instead."
1,Do not buy this version,"The DVD you will receive in the mail is not the one pictured. This has been my most disappointing Amazon purchase yet. The DVD itself looks as though it was made by a 16-year old in his basement with a laptop. Also, my copy was defective. When I reached the fifth chapter of the film, it just stops. Stay away from this version of the film."
4,Great transfer of a classic movie,"Now that Night of the Living Dead has passed into the public domain, there are many different versions, remakes, copyies and mashups.I can't speak for the others, but this particular version is excellent. Sound and vision are great.DVD extras include interviews with cast members and George Romero himself.Beware of ""cheap"" copies. This one is the version to get."
4,Night of the Living Dead does wonders for the Horror Genre,"For a film that is widely considered a horror classic, ""Night of the Living Dead"" has been handled with surprisingly poor care in the home video market over the years.For the longest time, the film was generally only available on VHS copies that could often be found in the bargain bins of your local video store. The reason for the cheap price became apparent after viewing. The picture quality of many of these editions was so poor that viewing them made you feel as if you were watching the movie through dirty aquarium water.With the advent of DVD there have been ocassional first rate packages out there but more often than not the film was still mishandled and if you've seen the film, countless times, watching this DVD is almost like viewing it for the very first time."
4,mike nelson rocks,"we've all seen the movie and we all know colorization sucks, so the important thing here is Mike Nelson's commentary. i see a lot of people don't ""get it"", but if you're into Nelson's acerbic wit then you should enjoy this DVD. it does nothing to further your love foe NOTLD but it's plain funny. so piss on all these bad reviews, if your an MST:3K fan, please realize, these people take themselves WAY too seriously."
3,Go for a different version of this film,This has always been my #1 rated horror movie. But this version is terrible. The new scenes ruin the original movie entirely adding absolutely nothing but stupidity.Go for the original...it's still the best out there.
3,The third most overrated horror film.,"""Night of the Living Dead"" is another low-budget horror film that didn't scare me or terrify me to the limit. Probably the only scene that scared me and shocked me was the ending. Duane Jones was probably the only good actor in the cast, because he was the most rational character in the film. Everyone else seemed so hysterical to the point where the film was more campy than scary. For that reason, I didn't care about what happened to the characters except for Duane Jones'. He kept the film at a higher degree of realism, but he was surrounded by rather mediocre actors playing sometimes stupid and irrational characters. I would suggest ""Halloween"" if you want the best in low-budget horror."
2,barely legal,"do not purchase this version of notld unless all other versions are phased out. horrible film transfer,with lots of missing film and dialogue.you're better off taping it on a&e w/the commercials cut out."
3,Dead fans should really get a life,"What's the big deal really. Honestly, I saw this movie after hearing many horrible reviews from ""fan boys"" around the country. I thought the new footage wasn't detracting at all from the original film. This is probably the best print that I have seen of the movie. I wasn't even able to tell the difference between the ""New"" Zombie footage and the old footage. Then again I'm not a super fan boy who stays at home in my Mom's basement on a Saturday night wearing my ""Spock"" ears debating which is worse Jar Jar Banks or the Ewoks!"
3,Previewing the Movie,Preview either needs to be extended by a minute or moved ahead a few showing a car driving down the road no people or voice's isn't a preview at all
1,Night of the living dead,"The item was not able to play because the blue ray was for a different zone, more likely another country, I would not purchase an item not playable in the united states. I am totally disappointed in amazon and will think twice before I purchase anything from here again."
3,Review of the Blu Ray disk for Night of the Living Dead,"The 1968 film ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a classic and the start of a very popular genre of horror films. This blu ray disc contains a very good transfer of the original film but with one major drawback. I seem to remember this film in 16x9 aspect ratio when I saw it at a drive-in theater whereas this blu ray is a mere 4x3 aspect ratio. To a film purest like me this is a real disappointment but it is the best print available at this time from what I can see so I kept it. If this company can do as good a job with a 16x9 print I would buy it from them as well."
1,Get a different version,"I was raised on horror movies, and Romero's ""Dead"" trilogy in particular. Naturally, when I got a DVD player, this was one of the first films that I wanted. Thankfully, I took this edition out of the library rather than purchasing it, because I would have kicked myself forever for buying it. My advice? Go for another edition with more extras, or buy the VHS version. It's not worth the money. I only gave this one star because the computer kicked it back without a rating."
1,Has John Russo lost his mind!,"Really, NOTLD was a great movie, you cannot improve upon greatness, so don't try. I know John Russo worked on the screenplay to the first NOTLD, but he should have left it alone. All the talent must have been from the great George A. Romero. John Russo should stick to skin filcks like his Santa Calws and Scream Queen's Naked Christmas where nobody cares about a story line. Leave the classics to someone who knows what they are doing!"
1,Color??? That'll be the death of this movie!,"Black and White made the atmosphere of this Romero classic perfect. Even on some levels, the Black and White helped in the racial undertones that you feel in the movie where the black man is the hero for the scared white people in the farmhouse. But colorized?The effects work in B&W.; In color they'll just look campy.This was a bad marketing idea."
3,dont waste your money sick but not scary,id get the shining or pet semetary for a scary movie classic the shining is the scariest ever pet sematary was scary but stupid.
1,Zero stars - about as scary as a cartoon,"I have no idea how this film ever made it to cult status. I thought it might have been taken as a ""turkey"" - an unintentional comedy because of its dismal production values, 8 mm film quality, and 20$ reel to reel tape recorder audio standards. No! There are people who actually find this frightening. I want their names so that I won't have them around me during a real crisis - they would probably fall apart. I don't get this film. A group of ugly actors stumble around trying to act like zombies. Occasionally, they eat meat -pretending it is human flesh. It isn't scary. It is simply a low budget, drive in movie that might have filled the third slot of a late night triple feature. The story could be told in 30 seconds. Horribly bad. And I don't mean so bad that it is campy and funny. Just horribly bad."
1,"Sorry people,I HATED IT","Like the title says,I didn't find anything great about this movie,it was boring,dull and so weak that I fell asleep watching it.And no,I saw this long before I saw Resident Evil,which I found more entertaning then this."
4,Night in color,"If you're looking for a colorized version of Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead, with a Black and White version on the same disc, look no further than this, as it's a nice print presentation, both colorized and non.The original film is the one that brought about the zombie craze throughout the world, despite its slow pacing of survivors boarding themselves into a prison they may never escape. The living dead are slow and dumb here, just as you would hope. Had to have the colorized version, the car is red here, with plenty of green trees, but the gore and blood has really been toned down color wise, as this seems made for TV. The commentary is decent, though off topic from time to time, and seemingly not from a true fan, but that's debatable. A good disc."
1,30th disgrace,"What happened? Night of the living dead is one of the all time classics of horror.This limited edition of only 15000 (thank god) is terrible. Terrible soundtrack, terrible making of featurrette, terrible new scenes, etc.Oh and that score for the original come on what are they thinking. No wonder these where the people who brought you Santa Claws.The only good thing to come out of this was that unbelievable crystal clear quality of the original. Given that quality, a score approved by director romero, and commentary with romero youve got a winner. Fortunately, one already exists.Dont waste your time on this one."
4,Color Not a Problem,"I have seen this excellent movie about 5 times (in B&W; Laserdisc) in the past. I am very happy with this color version (I will watch the the B&W; portion next year). After I noticed the colored automobile, I became engrossed in the story and I didn't notice the color much thereafter.This reissue is obviously better than tape or Laserdisc. If you have not upgraded to DVD yet, this is the version I would choose.Note that this the only ""Living Dead"" Type Movie I possess."
4,a true classic in every way....,"This is a classic flick in every way! It has some not so great acting, and a little cheesyness here & there, but all in all it has several scary moments. The funniest thing to me, tho, is at the opening, the zombie that attacks then chases Barbara is moving pretty quickly, then when it shows him arrive at the house later, he slowly turns to look at the other zombies, THEN he starts swaying and moving really slowly & stiffly! It's like he probably thought, ""oh yea, I'm a zombie, I guess I better stiffen up!"" Try to notice that the next time you watch this classic. I bet when this came out in 1968, it was considered horrible & shocking!"
1,A COMPLETE ABOMINATION!,"First off, I absolutely LOVE Night Of The Living Dead! It is a classic. Unfortunately, I just had the bad luck of seeing the 30th Anniversary Edition of Night Of The Living Dead on Cinemax and was completely appalled at... this classic film [edition]. Fortunately, all I wasted was a few minutes... I honestly had to check the TV guide to make sure I was on the right channel...The second thing that shook me was... [the] music score that completely detracted from the eerie feeling that the original film so brilliantly conveyed. I will be honest; I couldn't even sit through this...I am just glad to see that I am not alone in my... [disappointment]..."
2,"The horror, the horror....",GOOD GOD! This is butchery! The added scenes were terrible! The music was absolutley asstacular! Why? Whyyyyyy? The only reason that I gave this movie a two was because it still contains some of the classic film. I'm suprised that the genius who thought up the idea to add those horrible scenes didn't just ditch the whole movie and just remake it starring that damn preacher.
1,AN UTTER DESECRATION OF A HORROR CLASSIC,"Dear lord, what has that old fool John Russo done? Mr. ""I Co-wrote 'Night of the Living Dead,' So How Come I'm Not Famous?"" managed to convince the other original backers of the film to do this 30th Anniversary edition (a year late, by the way, for the actual 30th anniversary of the movie!), found some old B&W film stock, and has shot 20 minutes of new footage that makes no sense and detracts from the film's pacing. Worse yet, he's CUT 15 minutes of footage that adds character and depth to the film, plus he's added an awful, uninspired pop-rock soundtrack by the ludicrous Scott Vladimir Licina. Licina and Z-movie strumpette Debbie Rochon (Troma's ""Tromeo & Juliet"") are featured in an epilogue that is more embarrassing than enlightening. See what George Lucas started? At least George Romero was smart enough to wash his hands of this entire sorry mess."
5,Can't Beat a classic......especially a dead one,"As it stands, this is the one that changed everything that is horror. From the creepy beginning to the chilling end, this movie re-defined the traditional campy horror film. For a film that stood in the mist of cheesy 60's scifi and horror popcorn matinees, it grabbed audiences, just like Chainsaw and Halloween did in the late 70's. I highly recommend this one to be a serious midnight movie to watch, especially on Halloween. Elite Entertainment has done a super job assembling this Millenium edition with superb 5.1 Audio with a truck-load of features. Even an a scene or two from an abandoned Romero film named There will always be Vanilla. For the cult fans out there collecting the DVD horror base, this is a must own. Don't miss out"
1,filth of the lowest order,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This is TERRIBLE. Being a fan of the genre I was ecstatic to see a special edition version of NOTLD. Little did I know that the so called ""never before seen footage"" would consist of below b-movie acting writing and direction, as well as a dead ringer for Anton LaVey posing as a priest. The same Anton LaVey lookalike who is responible for BUTCHERING the original score. The bonus soundtrack cd isn't even the original spooky score! It's the worst kind of MIDIfied noodling with no emotion behind it whatsover. Stay far away from this. Far, far away."
4,terrific Blu-Ray picture quality- FORGOTTEN FILMS got it right,"It was a true pleasure watching NIGHT in Blu!I've seen many versions, from midnight shows to VHS to Laserdisc to DVD and finally Blu and I am very happy with the quality of the print. For everyone that thinks that NOLD was an ugly looking film, they couldn't be more wrong. When you look at this version, you realize, how beautifully lit everything was for black and white.Great horror film. Beautiful transfer."
1,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?,"This is one ""deluxe anniversary edition"" you should avoid at all costs. Those familiar with the original masterpiece will recoil in horror to see how it has been altered. The new footage is senseless and poorly filmed and does not match the original image at all. It really detracts the pacing and tight structure of the original film. Try the collector's edition re-mastered in THX. That's all you should consider...this was an ill-concieved attempt to cash in for the 30th anniversary. Nothing more."
2,Night Of the Living Dread,"I borrowed this froma buddy at work and it is amazing. But not in a good way. I'm amazed the original group involved w/ the movie (excluding George) could ever do what was done to this. The new scenes are unwatchable. In the commentary they babble on on how seamless they are implemented. But they don't discuss how BADLY they were acted. I gave this ""new"" movie two stars for the following, ONE: Clarity, TWO: the music is great but it doesn't fit with the feel I've known this movie to possess. If you are looking to throw some money away, this is a way to do it I guess ... At least it's legal."
1,Gimme The Grainy,"As a die-hard fan of the original NOLD (and its sequels including Tom Savini's charming 1990 remake)I was not disappointed by this 30th Anniversary revamping. Reason being, the idea itself is the most disappointing aspect: ""hey let's take our little classic and ruin it!"" I am pleased to see George Romero had nothing to do with this experiment. And that's exactly what it is to me, an experiment that was bound to fail from its very inception. But I was very eager to watch it with an open mind, knowing full well it will never replace the original masterpiece--in my heart OR on late-night Halloween tv airings. It's a good alternative to those of us who know the original line-by-line, shot-by-shot but I still heartily recommend purchasing the Elite company's remastered (and unchanged) edition that was released in 1995."
1,Terrible waste of money.,"I'm sorry...They have spoiled this classic film with a new score that sounds like it's from 1981, and terrible new scenes that don't fit in at all with the original film. This project had my hopes up, but just didn't pan out at all. I wish I'd spent my money on something else. Yuck!"
5,A movie that will scare you silly.,"I have seen both the black-and-white, and color versions of this movie, not the 1990s version. When I first saw this movie it scared me to death, well not quite. This is one movie that you will enjoy. After I saw that movie, I dreamt that the entire world was infected by zombies and the only way to survive was to board up all of the windows and doors and have a ring of salt and fire around your house."
1,Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition),"This is by far the best copy on dvd of this movie. I was tempted in the past to buy this version but hesitated until I read other reviews on your website and decided to purchase this version after reading the high reviews. Being a big George Romero fan, I own other versions of this movie on dvd and vhs and always strive to get the best quality films I can. The Millennium Edition of this movie is the best money can buy."
3,night of the living dead bottems out,"this would have been alot better but they made film in black and white good plot and decent theme but i think they ran outta ideas the story line kinda drags in place and to much talkin and not enough zombie action they lost their focus on this movie should have had alot more zombie focus and not so much char focus i thought lame, yes a few get killed by zombies but nothing like other movies.. id steer clear of this one unless ya collect series"
2,IT'S SO BORING!,"The Night Of The Living Dead is a really boring, low-budget, black and white zombie film. The acting is pretty hollow and there are no real scary parts. Every time you'd think the film would be scary - it's not, becuase it's in black and white and most of the ""scary parts"" take place in the nighttime so it's really hard to see any details. I'd give it 1 star if it wasn't for that great music at the end!"
2,Introduced us to zombie films,NOTLD is a odd horror movie made in the 60s with a low budget(The movie is shot in b&w; and had unknown actors and basically one production design(a house). The movie is good to watch only once or twice in either b&w; or color(The colorized version is the best way to watch this) and the this is the movie that introduced us to zombie movies by a unknown director(back then)named George Romero. Don't expect state-of-the-art special effects because the only effects they used were chocolate sauce and meat from the butcher Romero knew but expect a weird and sometimes creepy horror movie that remains a classic still. Theres been lots of DVD releases of this one stick with the Millennium Edition and skip the 30th Anniversary Edition.Other Recommende zombie movies:Dawn of the Dead(1978 version)ZombieZombie LakeDead Heat
2,This refers to the 30th anniversary edition.,What I don't get is the new footage. They didn't fit the movie and all they did was destroy it. The new music ruined it also. I hated the new ending. I mean come on! 1 year later all the zombies were destroyed? NOTHING in the new footage had anything to do with Night of the Living Dead or the rest of the series. Just buy the Millenium edition.
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"Maybe I'm just a purist in this regard but I was utterly disappointed with the 30th anniversary edition of NOTLD. The additional scenes, shot with current film stock, are so appaling that I question the reasons for their inclusion. The new soundtrack is bearable at best, but detracts from the edgy feel of the original. Also, the re-recorded news broadcasts were nothing more than irritating.While I enjoy having a decent copy of the film on hand, it's a difficult version to watch. You'd be better off buying the Evil Dead DVD."
4,This is the NOTLD to buy,"After listening to the hilarious interview between Max Brooks and George A. Romero at last years COMICCON, I was reminded how upsetting it was that GEORGE never got the copyright logo put on his original release of NOTLD. This means that for years George has been denied royalties and a means of making a living from the FILM he created. I approached him and offered that he should simply release his own PUBLIC DOMAIN version but fill it with stuff only he has access to. The 40th anniversary release gets this right and is a signature George Romero cover. This is the NOTLD to buy if you want to support the artist who originated the Zombie phenomenon, and support future visions from one of Horror Cinemas true legends. Support George by buying this DVD and STAY SCARED.In case you weren't sure about the film, the transfer is terrific and NOTLD is an absolute must for any collector of DVDs horror or not."
1,A Mishap Of Horror,"Do yourself a favor and just buy the Millenium Edition. I made the mistake of buying this for the 15 minutes of ""extra footage, the way the movie was meant to be made."" Well, I was beyond disappointment. Besides contradicting the original film, if taken seriously as a part of the Living Dead Trilogy, it destroys ""Dawn"" and ""Day"" as well. Don't waste the money."
3,Back from the dead?,"I was also unhappy with the quality of the sound in this dvd. The new soundtrack seemed to mute all the background sound, the nornal sounds of movement etc., and even have the voices unsychronized with the mouths of the actors. The added scenes were newly filmed and add in, not former cutting room floor refugees. Save some money and buy a regular version of the movie."
1,Greenstate Pictures,"The rating of this film does not pertain to the original cult classic by George A. Romero. It refers to the horribly acted, slow moving joke of new footage which is easily detectible from the original footage. And its distracting new musical score would do better on a soundtrack for a new movie. This masterpiece of its time has been ruthlessly butchered. Everything added to this 30th anniversary edition not counting the digital mastering has soiled the original. Don't let the fancy silver case fool you. Those who are responsible for this atrocity should be fed to the zombies."
3,Night of the Living Blasphemy.....,This is one of my all time favorite movies.I hafto say that the scenes with the new zombies blended well but the new scenes with live people sucked.I dont see why they had to desecrate this movie like this.I bought it because I'm a collector of all things Living Dead series.If you arent a collector and you're just looking for a good version of Night this is not it.Try the 25th Anniversary version instead.It's awesome!!
1,Don't even bother. Really.,"Although his name appears in the credits, George Romero was in no way involved with this project. The new footage doesn't match the original. Despite a mountain of makeup, Bill Hinzman looks much older than his first incarnation of the cemetary zombie. What was he thinking? New cuts and fades, intended to improve the pacing of the film, seem premature and at times omit valuable dialogue. The prologue and epilogue add little importance overall,the main addition being a religious subplot which frames the entire story. Licina's newly recored soundtrack reminds me of bad MIDI files imbedded in somebody's web page. That being said, Night of the Living Dead: 30th Anniversary Edition suffers most from the lack of one person....George A. Romero."
4,Night of the Living Dead Blu-Ray by Forgotten Films,"This is a great release of a classic film. This is the version by Forgotten Films. The film transfer is the best I've seen (it is in 4x3, which is the correct version). There is some static in one or two places, more than just ordinary film grain. In particular the redneck party at the end. It does have a 2.0 Stereo soundtrack, which is slightly better than a Mono track. There is even a large slideshow of images from the movie.The only major downside I can see with this release is the lousy artwork used for the case. It just has a screengrab of one of the random zombies from the movie with a block and some text around it. The image is fairly sharp on the printed-out artwork, which wasn't cut out straight, but it's just not an image I would've chosen myself. Also, the disc label was printed off-center, so you can see white rings around the center. With a little work, this could be a 5-star release."
4,THE BEST CULT CLASSIC,"this movie is the most original movie i have ever seen. the first of its kind. the color doesnt add much, but the commentary is enteresting. i deeply suggest this product."
5,Night of the Living Dead (Enhanced Edition) - 1968,"Night of the Living Dead (Enhanced Edition) - 1968 is a horror movie classic with a well-written script, effective music and well played parts. The beautiful Judith O' Dea plays one of the leading roles and the leading male role was played by Duane Jones. At the time it was seen as very progressive for the hero to be played by an African American. This is one of the best horror movies that I have ever seen and can be compared with other greats such as The Omen, The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. I can strongly recommend it. 5/5."
2,"Confound you, ambitious filmmakers!","NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is arguably the greatest horror film of all-time, and easily one of the most influential ever made. However, this DVD does NOT contain the true version of the film. Despite the fact that it includes a couple nice special features, this version of the film is for die-hard Romero fans only.The film has been re-edited, with new, completely unnecessary scenes inserted; also, Scott Vladimir Lacina has replaced the popular score of library music from the first film with a new score. John A. Russo lead the project, and said he was surprised by the reaction of fans. Well, nice job, Mr. Russo, you damned the film straight to hell. I cannot tell you enough times not to purchase this edition.Confound you, ambitious filmmakers!"
2,The one that started it all,"If you're all about sound and picture quality, than this DVD isn't for you. Spend the few extra bucks to buy the millennium edition, you won't regret it. This DVD is just another sad video tape print with lines and scratches, film bouncing all over the place, terrible edit cuts, etc....While the movie may be a horror classic, there definately is no point in releasing a film on DVD unless they plan to clean up the print enough to where it appears new. I used to watch Psycho with all the crackling and lines and such, but when I bought the DVD I was amazed at how much the print was cleaned up. DVD's should have more thought that go into them before the final product is released. I guess that's what I get for being cheap and buying the $7.00 way out."
1,PAINFULLY BAD,"If Ed Wood was still alive he couldn't even get excited about the new scenes in this film. If you are a fan of night of the living dead buy the elite dvd but stay far away from the special edition. The new scenes add nothing to the story and actually detract from it. Russo's direction in the new scenes is about as exciting and creative as a wet sponge. The new scenes are poorly written and the acting is even worse. I was really looking forward to this and was terribly disappointed. View at your own risk - stomach aches, nausea, vomiting could be the result at seeing a master piece of a horror movie butchered courtesy of Russo and friends."
1,I couldn't get rid of this DVD fast enough!!!,"This 30th Anniversary Edition is pathetic. New scenes were added, new music was added, the film was re-edited and changed. Each and every one of these things made it worse. Please search out the proper original version of this film that George A Romero directed. (try the Elite DVD for example) Avoid this one."
4,An excellent movie for the horror genre!,George A. Romero's (1968) original theatrical release of Night Of The Living Dead...is an excellent example of what a zombie horror movie should be like!...The Elite Entertainment THX certified mono audio soundtrack and transfer are by far the best I've seen for Night Of The Living Dead...The Elite Entertainment...Millenium Edition Night Of The Living Dead...Adds an excellent 5.1 Surround Dolby Soundtrack...making this the version of choice!...Don't be fooled however...If you're looking for an affordable THX certified horror movie that holds up by today's standard of horror movies...Then Night Of The Living Dead should be a serious consideration for your DVD collection...
1,sounds...,"I worked at a video store and played this film,which the musical score which they changed on this dvd... ruined that horror classic feel that the original score had which made it scary,i just scene in tower another edition released thats uncut which should be alot better ,it was just released."
3,Night Of The Living gore!,"For me, usaully gory horror films don't have any appeal. Well dudes, I'll have to make two exceptions: Arthur Crabtree's Fiend Without A Face, and George A. Romero's Night Of The Living Dead.I supose Night Of The Living Dead is not a really great movie, and it has some terrible acting, but it is an unbeleivably suspensful picture. It has a terrific opening scene, and some great shoestring atmosphere, but it's leauges behind Herk Harvey's subtle, surreal Carnival Of Souls, and Robert Wiene's expressionist masterwork Kabbinet des doctor Kaligari, but it's still quite good. Not Rated, but definetly deserves an R for explict gory violence, and a zombie's bare bum stareing at the screen."
1,Don't waste your time with this...,"This disk is not worth the money or the metal and plastic used to record it. Do yourself a favor and buy the Elite version. Russo & co. are just out to make a quick buck by exploiting this classic. This is one of the best horror films ever made and this so-called ""Special Edition"" adds nothing to the film. The Elite version should be available on Amazon. Sure, you may pay a few dollars more-- but Romero did NOT authorize this re-edited disk. Besides, the picture quality is far superior on the Elite disk. The one star rating is for the ""30th Anniversary"" edition only. Otherwise, the film gets FIVE stars."
2,3D Night of Living Dead (2-D & 3-D Versions Included),The 3-d has to be used with some special razor 3d glasses reg 3D glasses dont work. I wish I had known that before ordering.
4,Great movie.,This anniversary edition is very well done and the added parts fit in well with the film and are hardly noticeable except for showing a sharper picture than the rest of the movie. The soundtrack is appropiate and fit well with the mood of the movie. Only complain is that some parts were cut to make room for the extra footage and it is noticeable. Overall: GOOD.
2,"Great Film, Lousy DVD","This is a horror masterpiece. There's some good amateur acting and some violence and gore, but there's also a strong plot and an incredibly tense atmosphere. George A. Romero, like Alfred Hitchcock, plays his audience like a piano.This DVD by (shudder) Madacy has lousy picture quality and wafer thin sound. The extras (trivia game, biography, poster art) are typical of Madacy."
5,Horror as horror is meant to be,"An absolte must to own if you are a fan of horror. An absolte must to have at Halloween(invite the friends over for a viewing)As old as this film is, it still entertain, and to think most horror flicks just wouldn't be the same without this ""first on the block"" film."
5,great dvd by madacy entertainment,i ordered this and i keep hearing review that the quality is so bad and then sound is too well i just got it and it isnt realy that bad its great for only 8$ because you get the movie (i have to admit the quality is like a vhs but who cares)the original one not some 30th anniversary that ruined its good name and though the features arent hat good there pretty fun to play around with (the trivia game)so ifyou really extremely love this movie i get this dvd but if your upsest with it get the millenium edition for 20$ but this version is good for people who like it but not really too crazy about it
2,Living Dead finally dies,"Let the buyer beware: While this disc contains two versions of the 1968 horror classic, both are ersatz. One version is a ""special"" edition, with newly shot footage concocted by one cowriter and one coproducer (director George A. Romero was not involved in any way). Aside from being unforgivably shoddy and stupid, the new footage also diminishes the original's claustrophobic menace. The other version presents the film as it was intended--except that it replaces the original's cheesy, library-derived score with a cheesier original one."
1,Low Scum,"A shameful rip-off of all the original film's fans by John Russo. The new footage is Amateur Hour & unnecessary, the new acting is pathetic & this DVD abomination should be shunned by everyone, old fans & new audiences wondering what all the classic fuss is about. (After I threw it across the room, my puppy even poohed on it!)"
3,Not the original you thought it was.,"I use to be really big into Romero's dead series. My favorite of the series remains ""Day Of the Dead"". But these days as I got back and view these films, I see just how badly directed they are.NOW, I just watched ""The Last Man On Earth"" with Vincent Price (which came before NOTLD) nd I just couldn't help but to think how Romero basically ripped off this film. If you think Romero's take on zombies is original, check out the Vincent Price film."
2,Zombie movies are a lot like zombies...,"All right, now I am no fan of zombie movies, but if anything I suppose there has to be some limited appreciation for this, Romero's film which some say 'started this whole zombie thing'. As such, I do appreciate that Romero understands there is more to fright then gore. In fact, as far as I am concerned the focus is all on those inside the house, with yes that memory about what lurks outside.Still though, I just do not see anything too particularly enthralling about zombies. I mean, they are zombies with zombiesqe movements and zombiesh attitudes. This means they are slow and boring. Now as I mentioned, Romero helped alleviate this, but I still, with my clear anti-zombie bias, am not a fan of this film. Sorry."
4,"Tales of Bad Men, Bad Women, and Bad Places","After reading LaSalle and the Discovery of the Great West, I began to look for more information on LaSalle's camp on Matagorda Bay. I bought this book for the chapter on LaSalle. The rest of the book is a collection of Texas stories, many of which seem true. The book did have a few J Frank Dobie type tales. The tales cross the entire state and cover most time periods, from LaSalle all the way to Bonnie and Clyde. The book has also given me a few short stories on Texas towns that I have driven through for years. I recommend this book to all who enjoy the lighter side of Texas History."
5,this technique works even for the nonswimmer,"This is not just for triathletes. As someone who flailed wildly about in the water after a mere 20 feet, I was skeptical that I would make progress. I used both this video and the book. This video helped me visualize better some of the drills in the book and worked nicely as a supplement to the book. Both are geared towards swimming more efficiently in the water by making yourself cut through the water though better use of your body position. Using the book and video together I have become more comfortable in the water and can now cover considerably more distance--also stopped fighting the water."
3,Not happy...,"$30 for this and no case?! I can't believe that for $30, this is delivered in a sleeve that doesn't even close.Also, having read the book, I thought the disk would expand on the material in the book. Instead, it only goes very quickly through the drills. Perhaps this would be sufficient for an experienced swimmer, but for a novice, it is really lacking in content."
2,Did not put it all together,The DVD is like a novel where the plot is going along and then the author just seem to run out of pages without a satisfactory conclusion. The DVD gives the student all the drills but never tells you how to put it together in a freestyle stroke. Perhaps later editions will go the extra chapter.
4,Freestyle: Made Easy,"I bought the book Total Immersion by Terry Laughlin. This ""Freestyle: Made Easy"" video is helpful in bridging some of the gaps I have when reading the book especially when a video clip ""speaks a thousand words""."
1,Not good video,Not very useful.90% is demonstrated by an old man - not fit at all. I didn't see much sports beauty or strength.I think it is a waste of money.
4,A Great Tool When Used In Conjunction With Book,"This DVD is a great watch, & very useful to get a visuale aspect on drills as explained in 'Triathlon Swimming Made Easy'. It has great underwater & above water footage, & a really cool shot of fully underwater freestyle. However, it would be less useful if used as a stand alone product."
5,A great little book to share with your crew,"If only! How many times have you wished that you had known about some part of sailing--before ending up in knots and tangles? With a great wit and clever technique, this book will inform, amaze, and have you chuckling all at the same time! A great addition to the libraries of old salts or sailing neophytes."
3,Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Started Sailing,This book contained lots of helpful hints for the new sailor in a humorous way. Easy and fun to read!
5,Nice and fun book to have,"I think this book is more for entertaining, because once you don't have what you should have on a boat, it's pretty much too late..."
5,200 entries which blend humor with solid practical advice,"If you think a serious approach is inherent in a book like John Vigor's Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Started Sailing, think again: there's no orthodoxy to sailing, and plenty of truths to tell - and Vigor reveals them in 200 entries which blend humor with solid practical advice. From knowing what kind of documentation is needed to sail into foreign waters to renaming or repainting a boat, Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Started Sailing avoids many pitfalls."
3,A strange book,"I bought this book thinking it would provide insights into what to avoid in sailing within a humorous context. I found some of the information useful and thought provoking. But it is written in an alphabetical arrangement of topics, so it is more of a dictionary or reference style that you can come back to and quickly find topics. The cover indicates a wide use of comedy, but I found that sparse. I read it cover to cover, and it is not a compilations of stories detailing funny ""don't do it this way."""
2,Much of this book is copied verbatim from an earlier Vigor book,"John Vigor's ""Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Started Sailing"" is a relatively short book full of tidbit of sailing knowledge. It is arranged alphabetically by subject with short entries. Some are humorous, some are serious, and some are much more useful than others.So why only two stars? After seeing John Vigor's ""The Practical Mariner's Book of Knowledge"" listed as a source and purchasing that book, I found out that many of the entries in this book were copied verbatim from Vigor's earlier book."
5,Elina comes again!,"I love barbie and her movies. The fairytopia series is really good but the new Fairytopia movie is more enchanting and beautiful.i love her new wings. Sunburst is mean and snotty to elina in the Beginning but when elina saves her from laverna, Sunburst now knows how it takes to save fairytopia.It takes bravery and will. not for attention like Sunburst first thinked.Here is some other barbie movies that i have:-Barbie in the Nutcracker-Barbie as Rapunzel-Barbie of Swan Lake*-Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper*-Barbie Fairytopia-Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus*-Barbie Fairytopia 2:Mermadia-The Barbie Diaries*-Barbie in the 12 Dancing princesses*-Barbie Fairytopia 3:Magic of the Rainbow*Barbie is going to have a new movie in the fall called Barbie as the Island Princess.It's going to be a musical just like the princess and the pauper.I want you to know something. the Star(*) next to some of my barbie movies mean that they are by favorites. I hope you enjoyed this movie."
5,Barbie Farytopia-Magic of the Rainbow,I love these movies because I watch them with my 3 yr. old grandaughter. She collects all the Barbie movies. She loved it.
1,Very Cheap!,II bought this movie because of the price but it wasn't worth it. I recommend you to pay the 3 dollars more and get the Mermaid fairytail.
5,great for your little princess!,My daughter received this movie for xmas. She loved it! She has been singing the songs since day one and she loves it!
3,"My four year old loves Barbie, but says this movie is too scary.","My four year old loves Barbie, but says this movie is too scary. My daughter has trouble watching some of the villains from the barbie movies."
1,Barbie Fairy Topia Magic of the Rainbow,Could not review it because it had a bubble like flaw on the playing face and it would not play. We e-mailed amazon and are awaiting an answer and a replacement DVD.
4,Girls love it!,"Although I am not a big Barbie fan, my 4 and 6 year old girls love this movie. It is a pretty decent movie-good messages about being nice and doing the right thing. Believe it or not Barbie is actually a strong role model. She solves problems on her own and doesn't wait for her Prince to save her."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I was surprised with this movie. The animation is still beautiful like all of the Barbie movies and Elena is a good role model, but I was disappointed with the plot and character development. In the past two movies Barbie must make sacrifices to save the land she loves, in this one all she has to do is be on somewhat good/bad terms with the other fairies in the school. I just didn't feel as if there was any growth in her character. Yes, she has many gifts - she is a very talented fairy but what does she do with them? She's also the only one who appears to know what is going on and how to the defeat the bad guy. I prefer the other 2 fairytopia movies."
5,Incredible!,"I saw this movie on Nickelodeon and I must say, this was Barbie's best movie yet. The colors were awesome in the Rainbow Dome scene, and once again, Elina helped save Fairytopia from Laverna. I especially liked the part where Elina's wings changed again. Now she'll be reminded of how together the Apprentices were strong against Laverna."
4,Granddaughter loved it,"Bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter. She loved it, but her all time favorite Barbie movie remains Barbie and the Three Musketeers."
4,Return to Fairytopia.,A great sequel. Daughter first read picture book and then watched movie. Enjoyed seeing her favorite characters again. Bibble gets a girlfriend....
3,My daughter doesn't really like it.,This is ok I guess but my daughter prefers other Barbie movies over this one. It isn't the worst movie though.
4,My daughter loves this movie!,"So far, she has all the Barbie movies ever made and she loves them all! What can say, she is a Barbie fan!"
4,Prompt Delivery,Barbie Fairytopia - Magic of the Rainbow (Purchased on 05/22/2008)Barbie as The Island Princess (Purchased on 05/22/2008)Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus (Purchased on 05/22/2008)All the above product was delivere on time & all in good condition...
3,"A ""Line in the grass.""",I purchased this to use as a way for my little brothers to use for flag football boundaries. Works pretty well and the color makes it easier to see in the grass.
5,Really emotional!,"Beckie lives in my Sheridan Road condo and I've known her for years and knew she was a pianist and cabaret singer, but had never heard her voice. So, ordered Real Emotional Girl and wow!!! Big girl and big fabulous full-bodied voice. Didn't realize that someone I knew could have such a fabulous talent!"
5,Excellent,"This is a very good book. I think many critics of Mormonism would find it extraordinarily challenging -- if they would read it. Sadly, they almost certainly won't. But I think Latter-day Saints generally will find Barry Bickmore's book fascinating and instructive. Highly recommended."
1,Not matching with Camry 2009 2.4L Engine,"It is almost 1in longer. I tried to install it in my Camry 2009 Base model, I gave up. It will not fit in the filter case. I think I waste my money and my time. Still they are saying it is match with Camry 2.4L Engine!!!! No it is not. I am so angry. The model of filter is 33-2260, it is not gonna fit, no way."
3,Very tight fit in Lexus RX 330,"I got the K&N; 33-2260 to replace the airfilter in my 2004 Lexus RX 330. I did my research and this was supposed to 'fit'. Well, it does fit; however, the rubber flange is a bit too thick for the air filter cowl to just snap into place. I struggled for quite a bit to get the cowl closed and locked into place. I probably need to take an Xacto knife to the rubber flange of the filter and shave it down a few mm.I haven't seen any noticeable increase in power or fuel economy, so I can't really comment on that."
5,"Fits well on my 2002 Camry LE, V6","This filter was a drop in replacement for the air filter in my 2002 Camry LE, V6. It was a bit of a struggle to get the back hinges lined up to close the air filter cover; but it was not due to this filter. Would have been the same effort with replacing with any other air filter. Have been running for a month without any issues."
5,Great filter!,"I purchased this filter 2 weeks ago for my 2002 Camry, after reviewing what other people said here and on other websites. It replaced a dirty paper filter and the difference was very clear! My car runs better, is more quiet when idling, and runs smooth downtown, on the highway and when I drive up in the mountains. I probably would have seen the same effect with a new paper filter, but the fact that I can clean this one and reuse it, made me decide to buy this one. Even if I would only use it for 50K miles and throw it away it would still be worth the price you pay at Amazon."
4,"Easy Installation, Saves Gas","I purchased two of these, one for a 2003 Camry and the other for a 2008 Sienna. It is a very easy installation, just pop off the filter cover for the old one and slip these pre-oiled filters in. Great for a car's lifetime. Two words of caution though: 1) buy the cleaner and oil kit because you will need it to clean the filter after about 5000 - 7000 miles and 2) make sure you install the filter correctly. The filter has a curved corner that matches perfectly with the filter box. If you are not attentive, you might not align it correctly and close the box without a good seal. I'm sure the instructions might tell you this, I never took the time, but I guess I had enough time to install it twice. After about 1000 miles, it seems to increase the fuel efficiency, but don't expect dilythium crystal - like increases/savigns. If you plan on keeping the car a lot of miles, the savings will add up."
4,Great Price Ratio!,"For under 40 bucks, this K&N filter was an excellent deal. Just on the fact it is washable/reuseable numerous time makes it a great deal already. After changing it, I did notice a smoother acceleration. As for it improving by a few HP, no idea on that."
4,K&N 33-2260 Air Filter,"It is great that the filter is suppose to last for many years. I have had it for about a year with no problems and have not had to clean it yet. At least for my car, I have not noticed any significant increase in the engine horsepower (hence the four stars)."
4,Lexus RX330 air filter,Installed this filter in our 2005 Lexus RX330. Noticed immediate improvement in throttle response and overall driveability. Solid increase in MPG of 3 for this application. I recommend it.
4,Easy to install and works great,It was easy to install and I did see a noticeable improvement in the gas mileage and power.
3,"Nice Filter, Easy to replace","I used this for my 03 camry v6.It's very easy to replace, Very good price on amazon.My results:Gave me a little more horsepower - when picking up you can hear the engine noise a little more, car picks up a little faster, and the pick up when already at high speed is also very good.Gas mileage results: I now get 1 mile less per gallon (21 instead of 22) average between highway and local."
5,Toyota Highlander,It was too easy to install the filter. The engine runs much smoother. Acceleration is crisper and faster. I don't have to change the filter as often. I used K&N filters before.
1,Easy install but car won't start,"I got the filter in today, quick install but car won't start. Tried to start it 3 times but car kept trying to turn over to no avail. Called K&N and they suggested cleaning mass air flow sensor. Replaced the stock filter and started right away. K&N offered full refund or free replacement. Will update with final review when issue is resolved."
5,"So far, so good","After reading both positive and negative comments regarding K&N Filters, I decided to give one a try anyway. This particular one was $28 from Amazon and $44 or more through local auto parts stores. I normally pay about $13 for a replacement. My thinking is that after cleaning it and reusing it three times I will be saving a little money. After running about 500 miles since installing it, I have noticed the car seems to have more ""spunk"" and I am getting ""a little"" more MPG. I have read where it increases HP and MPG, but that's not really why I bought one of the filters. At this point all I can say is ""so far, so good."" The true results will be 20000+ miles down the road..."
1,It does not fit my 2008 Camry,"The description of this item says it fits my 2008 Camry but it does not actually. It is too long in length and too narrow in width. I cannot install it into my car. When I want to replace it online, I found out it's not possible and I have to pay $6.00 if I want to return it. I think Amazon sent me the wrong item to me and it is amazon that made the mistake. I cannot find a way to contact the staff of amazon to illustrate my issue, which is really a bad customer experience."
5,The Greatest Female Singer of Our Generation...,"...And the most interesting trio working today-- that's the full package presented by The Tierney Sutton Band. Ms. Sutton's voice is the fourth instrument in what is in reality a quartet. In partnership with the incredible Christian Jacobs, Ray Brinker and Trey Henry and Kevin sharing bass, Tierney has produced a collection of songs of singular quality that demand your full attention. The addition of Jack Sheldon only adds to the importance of the CD. This band has deep roots with Jack Sheldon, and Sheldon is a major jazz figure who is consistantly overlooked for reasons that befuddle the muscians who have played with him or heard him play. He's a jazz master as well as showman, and I adore Tierney for including him on this master work. Play it loud, play it often. Buy as many copies as you can afford. We need to encourage the recording industry to make more Tierney Sutton Band recordings."
3,Not my favorite Tierney,"Her trio is great, she sounds good- but her other recordings are more enjoyable to me. This album is made up of songs with the word happy in them but most are done contrary to their original styles- so most are sort of dark sounding and down. The one bright spot is the duet with Jack Sheldon on ""I want to be happy"". I would suggest one of her other CD's if this is your first Tierney Sutton album."
3,Yawn,"Ms Sutton spent a lot of time and effort trying to make the standards on this CD different. At best, her voice is superb as always but the changes are just so unnecessary and actually boring. I keep replaying the CD hoping it will somehow grow on me but compared to her other works, this effort is not up to par."
4,songs to put you in a mood,"Ms. Sutton's style and choice of songs puts me in the mood to be part of that joyous and sophisticated semi-mythical group ""New York Cafe Society."""
1,Awful,"About three years ago, I bought Tierney's albums: ""Dancing in the Dark"" and ""Something Cool."" They're wonderful. I was at our library yesterday and found two newer (I think) albums: ""Desire"" and ""On the Other Side."" They're god awful--even worse than Willie Nelson's stuff."
1,Overdone,"Overall musically, the worst CD I have purchased in over a year. Torturous, ""cutesy"" arrangements such as these sound like late-Torme or moast-affected Streisand. Escepting ""Smile"" and ""Glad to Be Unhappy"". Just sing the cong."
4,"WELL-DONE, OR RATHER, WELL-COOKED","In this ""MySQL Cookbook"", Paul DuBois ensured that a wide range of topics were covered. In fact, most Unix and Mac OS X users would cherish the contents of this text. Comprehensive information were presented in a very uncomplicated way. The book did advanced analysis of all MySQL-based scripts which are applicable to Java, Perl, Python and PHP. The same story goes for MySQL-based web scripts under Apache and Tomcat. It gave readers sufficient guidance to codes, using time-saving illustrative examples. However, beginners who need to start from the scratch may not appreciate this advanced approach.In conclusion, this is a dependable text that both intermediate and advanced MySQL learners would appreciate."
5,My son the computer tech was right--once again.,"I need to learn about MySQL for my small business. My son the computer tech said this was the book I needed to get me up to speed quickly. He was right. It's concise, apparently complete, and easy to understand, even if the subject is a bit mind-bending at times. Without a book like this, I wouldn't enjoy the learning experience; it would be less pleasant than another knee surgery.This book is highly recommended by a guy who has read a lot of instructional material in a 40-year career that included service as a part-time college instructor...and by his adult son whose computer library cost his dad thousands of dollars."
5,Useful book,"This book is useful for anyone looking to find examples of MySQL 4 usage in multiple languages such as PHP, Perl, Java, and Python. It covers many areas that are used in real world applications and is great as a reference material. This book is structured in the Problem/Solution layout of the Oreilly cookbook series."
5,A 'bible' of applications routines,"Paul DuBois' MY SQL COOKBOOK, 2nd EDITION isn't your usual guide to applications development: it IS a 'bible' of applications routines that helps designers move beyond problems they experience in the MySQL environment. This latest edition covers MySQL 5.0 and offers 'recipes' explaining how and why the code works to encourage more detailed learning rather than quick fixes alone. From accessing data from multiple tables to storing images and displaying them in web pages, any serious MySQL programmer or computer reference library needs this reference."
4,MySQL For Applications Server,Excellent text well written and logical sequencing of chapters.Very good for students in their second or third semester of RDBMS studies.I do not recomend for beginning relational databse students.
3,"Too much book, too much money.","If this was a quick reference book, then the information contained would be useful. This, unfortunately is a big book containing a little book's amount of useful info. Save your money and print out the mysql users guide that is available online for free. I found myself using the online guide as a reference even when the book was in front of me.Bottom line: A wide range of methods for doing things you probably already know how to do if you are using mysql."
4,Another good Pilcher novel,I have never read a dreadful Pilcher book by either mother or son but some are better than others. Robin does not write as well as his mother but his books stand on their own. This is a nice read I would recommend to others. It is not the best of the bunch but I am glad I bought and read it.
1,Son of Pollyanna,"NOT very believable. The problems Dan and family faced do not ""fix"" themselves just by wishful thinking as Pilcher would have us believe.A lay-about Dad goes to remote Scotland and ""finds himself"" within days; his lay-about son follows Dad and ""finds himself"" within days; two spoiled-brat teenage daughters go to visit Dad and brother and ""find themselves"" within HOURS. Poor wifie-Jackie--stays home and ""loses herself."" Only a total misogynist could create a woman as shallow and unredeeming as that. The best and only redeeming feature of the ""book"" was listening to the audio-CD version's wonderful Scottish accent of the narrator."
4,I enjoyed this book,"I really enjoyed this book; however, I felt the book ended before the story was done. I feel like it's all still hanging in midair. I HOPE MR. PILCHER DOES A SEQUEL SO I CAN HAVE SOME CLOSURE!Some of the characters were more developed than the others. I understood Dan re-evaluating his life, family and career (I did the same thing, having myself been laid off from a dot.com company in July just before 9/11). I did NOT understand Jackie (nor did I like her much - which was probably the point of her), however from Dan's reminiscences of their early relationship I would have thought she would have more depth and character than to abandon her entire family - she struck me as the martyr type.With all of that, I must say I quite enjoyed myself. I'm a huge Rosamunde Pilcher fan and find Robin to be an equally satisfying author."
4,Nice job!,"Once again, I enjoyed this novel by Robin Pilcher. I no longer attempt to compare his writings with his mother's. He stands alone and he's doing a splendid job. I have been a fan of Rosamunde Pilcher for quite a while now having read every one of her novels and enjoying them thoroughly."
2,Good for what it is....,"First let me say I love Hendrix and I really did enjoy what's here....BUT...There's really not much content to this disc....it's basically his two cavett appearances, which aren't his two best live performances by a long shot and a ""documentary"" of which 80% is those two same appearances....Let's be honest this disc might really be for hardcore Hendrix junkies only....I am one so I liked it, and I always love listening to him talk....but I think most folks would feel there's far too little actual content...Why not put ALL of Hendrix's television appearances on a DVD ? I'm sure they'd all fit on one....let's hope Experience Hendrix does better then this in the future...Hendrix at Monterey, Hendrix at Berkley, Royal Albert Hall, the remastered Isle of Wight, the rest of Hendrix on TV...where is it?d"
3,Good........Not Great..............Average!!!!!!!!!,I collected alot of Hendrix material I had seen bits and pieces of The Dick Cavett Show on earlier releases but never thought they would actually release it on DVD. Experience Hendrix did release this on DVD and I bought it the day they came out with it. I was kind of disapointed I mean come on...... this DVD is really all interviews with Dick Cavett and the hendrix performence is O.K........still worth a buy for a Hendrix collector. I think this DVD is is worth 3 stars and I know any true hendrix fan would love this DVD but if your looking for a real good hendrix DVD try looking at The Isle Of Wight Festival. I do still watch the Dick Cavett Show with Jimi Hendrix and I really do enjoy the material they included on this DVD. Enjoy!
4,More important culturally than musically.,"Being a rock icon in the 60s or 70s was very different from what it is today. Here is Jimi, smart, funny, humble and articulate. More inspiration in his little finger than a truckload of angry rappers.Even his playing came from a different place than today's super guitarists. Nowadays, to play in Jimi's league means spectacular technique--as if someone is giving a test. But Jimi's ability was intrinsic; all he had to do was play what he heard and felt. And what he heard and felt was as cool as it gets."
4,Jimi as he really was,"This is a fascinating glimpse of the real Jimi Hendrix in his traumatic last days. It's sad that James Marshall Hendrix's drug use is so obvious to everyone here for example.Cavett-What do you do when you get up in the morning?Hendrix-I try to get up every morning (audience laughs).Hendrix also gets into some spacey raps about the message of his music. Mightly weird stuff, but it's a fascinating glimpse of the man. But the music is the thing here. What's really nice is the way Hendrix and co. blend ""Izabella"" into ""Machine Gun.""Tragically, we all know what happened to Jimi one year after this episode.While it's very interesting to watch as a whole, parents might wanna show this to their kids as a warning about the dangers of drug abuse."
2,Great performance but little else,"Experience Hendrix really know how to make the bucks, first get 10 min of footage of Jimi and add 40 more minutes of [stuff] and put it out on DVD and sell heaps of em....I'm a fan but was caught off gaurd with this one, ..."
1,Don't Bother Buying this DVD,I purchased Dick Cavett's John Lennon and Yoko Ono interview and it was great. It was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material. I gained new insight about John and Yoko. So I bought Cavett's interview of Jimi Hendrix expecting something similar. The 15 minutes of glib questions by Cavett produced nothing new about Hendrix. Included in the DVD are a few minutes of Jimi playing at Woodstock. The rest of the DVD is mediocre at best.
1,2 minutes of Hexndrix,"Theres hardly any Jimi Hendrix in this. I think except for the three songs theres maybe 2 full minutes of Hendrix on this. How sad, they should of teamed up with 'someone' else and tried to make a real special DVD. One thing I learned about Hendrix was how photogenic he could be on a set."
1,Very little Tom Hardy,"I didn't like the movie and only bought it due to Tom Hardy being listed as an actor in the movie. He is lieterally in the movie for maybe 1 minute at most. Poor story, bad acting, crap movie."
5,woth every second,"This is a band I like to follow, they are a diverse group of guys with a very strong vocal and instrumental background. Seeing them live and listening to the CD is almost identical, as someone already commented on, but it's true you just don't get to see the stage presense which is the main difference. Worth a listen, try it you won't be disappointed, and if you are Chavo will give you your money back...:)(no guarantees)"
5,Gaviotas - inspiring,"Wonderful book, highly recommended, inspiring. A real look at sustainable development in a highly unlikely place in the world. MUST READ!!"
1,Incomprehensible technology,"Has anyone actually tried to understand the two big ""inventions"" the author describes? Can any of you make the ""sleeve pump"" work given the explanation and diagram in the book? Does the solar water still make any sense? If you can, I would like to hear from you, because I can't. I have raised these points wqith both the author and the publisher but got no help Dave Johnson"
3,Not as good as the first two books by Kasprov,I feel that Kasparov's first and second books in the series were better. It is nice in one way that Kasparov only put Fischer in this book as his earlier books had more players. I feel Fischer deserves extra recognition.I felt that Part 4 on Fischer was not quite as well organized as the first two books (I do not own the third one) and Kasparov makes the analysis a bit more difficult to follow for a lower rated player than before.I agree with all of the other reviewers that Kasparov does try and make Fischer look bad. It is both a good and bad point.
1,Too opinionated,"Kasparov is very bias with his assessments. He should have been more neutral. Being a Russian, I guess you can say he is bias toward Bobby. I was looking for more than what was offered. I liked volume 1 the best."
2,Fischer Afraid???,"A large supposition of Kasparov is that Fischer was ""afraid"" of Spassky, hence his argumentative and demanding behavior prior to the match. He was not afraid of any Russian. He, like many who strive for perfection, was afraid of his own shortcomings and possible failure. The fact that he not only overcame his inner trepidation to beat Spassky but that he did so with the roots of a severe mental illness present, clearly demonstrates without question that he was--The Greatest Champion. He not only overcame the Russians but also himself. He would have destroyed Karpov."
3,Kasparov laying down the FISH,"Kasparov had some good analysis of Fischer's games but I get a sense of bias towards fischer's games in the form of""well that was good but this was better"" kind of saying the move was not good enough for the era of chess in Fischer's time.Kasparov is a GREAT CHAMPION but clearly to say hes better than Fischer ever was thats up to the chessplayer who seriously take their games. IT IS A BOOK WORTH BUYING.I gave it a three star because of Kasparov views and because this book should be noted thats its not foranyone Under Class A Strength.Kasparov gets deep into the analysis and it gets pretty complicated, if you dont know your basic understanding on positional chess.."
3,"good collection, but is a rehash","This cd rehashes many of the Upsetters' early tracks, including the great ""People Funny Boy,"" but doesn't break any new ground with alternate takes, dubs, or unreleased tracks. One of many cds to feature the early, more raw, version of the Wailers track ""Duppy Conquerer,"", the cd is more a ploy to make a fast dollar than to put together a quality collection of the Upsetters.I can't completely recommend this cd, but do admit that the tracks on this cd are enjoyable and might be just what a Perry fan is looking for to get him/her going, so far be it from me to steer anyone away from this cd. There are better colections out there, but this one is acceptable, as well."
2,Very Generalized,"I found the ifnormation in this book to be very general. It seems the tried to cram a lot of information in this book however, all the information is just a breif summary. While there were a few good tips to use in the book, I found the training advice to be way too breif. This book would have been a lot better if they would have been more detailed about the training and cut out some other information that just made the book seem cluttered and unfocused."
5,The Hobo Philosopher,"Every time that I sit down to look something up in this set of books, I am awestruck. How any group could accomplish this is beyond my comprehension. This set of volumes is a college education in itself. My volumes are so used that they are falling apart but I keep sticking them back together.It is designed great. It has an Index and it is easy to follow. The trouble is once you look up an idea and start following it through this dictionary - your day is over.If you consider yourself an idea person, this set is for you.Books written by Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher:""Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..""""A Summer with Charlie""""A Little Something: Poetry and Prose""""Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother"""
3,Warmer,"Well it puts out heat.. just not as much as I needed. I would recommend this def. for a glass aquarium but not a terrarium, as the heat seems to disapate fast if not contained."
2,A Let Down,"This novel is set in the 40's, when Elizabeth Short (the Black Dahlia) was found murdered, her body cut in two. The characters revolve around the investigation of this incident, altnough her name is changed. The chapters go back and forth between the views of two brothers: one, an amoral cop, the other, a Catholic priest, Monsignor, businessman, whatever you want to call him. Neither one is likable, the 40's cop jargon is incomprehensible, and the Catholic politics/building programs are boring. However, the murder is solved and the end is neatly tied up with a bow.If old cop stories appeal to you, you might like this, but I'm sure you could find better. Double Indemnity, for instance, is superior."
3,Usually good,"Some of them only wrote once. I normally buy Memorex and they work well, not sure what happened with this batch."
2,Quality?,"I just bought this 5 set at Target, enclosed in a box and cellophane. Every single one of the five CDs had pieces of the jewel case fall apart when I opened it. Makes you wonder of the quality of this product. I've only used one CD-RW and it's worked okay so far."
2,below average mink blanket,"I bought 2 of these from the same seller. (Trading Post) It is not a good quality mink blanket. Because the original price was $89...I thought it would be desent quality. But, I was disappointed. Both of the blankets I purchased, had wavy edges. As if they were streatched or pulled. They are rich in color. They are not heavy mink blankets. I am a warm blooded person and don't require a blanket to be real heavy. I do know my other mink are a much higher quality."
3,not as heavy as they said,"they said it would be 10 lbs...it only weighedlike 5 or 6 lbs... all in all, good blanket, but i was looking for a heavier one"
5,So soft and all mine,I haven't had to wash it yet so I don't know how it'll be after that. Right now it's SO soft and warm. I cannot wait till winter starts and I get to cuddle under it. It's a little luxury in a mom's life right now.
3,Odd little book with a few bright gems,"The basic assumptions of this book completely contradict sociological theory established by C.Wright Mills and others. Throughout the text there are many assertions put forth at ""true"" which seem to be no more than the author's opinion.Some of it is far fetched and in a few spots down right bunk. Still, with all that being said, I found about eight statements that are absolutely classic and feel very worthwhile to me. Worth reading for those with open minds who can think for themselves. First read will take less than an hour, but if you are anything like me you will continue to think on the precepts for many days to come. LJB"
2,great concepts but more of an attempt of an author to make money,"it says on the back of the book that james allen never really accomplished anything special. not that the man cannot be a guru on happiness and such but it makes me doubt the legitimacy. he speaks with vague generalities and doesnt really cover anything extensively. there are multiple blank pages, misspelled words, and the font is big and separated like a 2nd grade novel. (59 pages long/ finished reading in about an hour) the purpuse of the book is to make you feel good basically, kind of like watching ""the secret"". if you plan on making an impact on your life this book alone wont be enough"
5,Timeless Knowledge,"As Og Mandino (The Greatest Miracle in the World) said, this book is from ""the hand of God"". Awesome, timeless knowledge for those who are ready for it. Buy several to give to friends and you'll still be back to replace your copy."
5,Great book,"Awesome read very relatable, true and sincere. Affords the reader an opportunity to retrospect, analyze and self develop. Great book."
5,GREAT CLASSICS,As a Man Thinketh is one of my all time favorites in literature. I often wondered if he had angelic visitations or something because he understood the mysteries of heaven pretty well. I find this a treasure of wisdom and knowledge I intent to use in my life and hopefully pass on to my kids.
3,Don't Know If I Quite Agree With Everything Written Here,"When I ordered this book, I was expecting something else. It is not what I thought it would be. I read a few pages and did not get much from it. I guess if I read further, I can get the point being made here. Too busy for it right now. It does nothing to keep my attention at the present time."
5,As A ManThinketh,"This is my favorite book of all time! If this was a Bible that everyone lived by, we would have a better and more enlightened world!"
5,Plesed,This product came pretty quickly and it was a great inspiring book to purchase. I would suggest this book to anyone to invest in.
4,Book is pocket size,This book came in time almost like a new. But this book is pocket size book with 20-30 pages. I did not expect this. May be I did not figure out from Amazon. Everything else is good expect this is smaller version.
4,Book that has stood the test of time,"I have read this book many times over. It is an incredible book which has tested the time with simple advice. The book does justice to the title ""As a man thinketh"". We are what we think. Just as discipline with physical aspects of our health and well-being, so is discipline required mentally and psychologically to ensure that we focus on productive thoughts and positive thoughts and feelings. Ultimately the invisible and unseen manifests into the physical and very real aspects our lives.In a number of chapters the author argues his case clearly about the impact and effect of thought of man. I consider this book to be the forerunner of The Secret. It deals with the law of attraction and the law of action. We will attract in our lives the things we focus on most and we will achieve based on our action. This book brings it all together, the physical, the spiritual and the mental. I recommend it."
5,Love it,This book contains a lot of good messages. It's very enlightening and powerful and positive and I recommend it to anyone who is seeking hope and a light on their dark situation. Words hold power and we have power within and to match them up is truth.
4,A great treatment for better people,"It presents simple and powerful ideas that are the basis of the current behaviour change books. Great lecture, but better if you live the words."
5,words of wisdom,"I found this little book many years ago. It was used, cost me 25 cents. It is a treasure, one I've read & re-read. the first couple of times I read it, it upset me & I couldn't accept the fact that I was living the life I had created with my own thoughts. As I have progressed in my spirituality it has become very clear, there are no victims, we create our own lives through our thoughts. Just bought a copy for my 15 year old grandaughter for her birthday. Really a great book."
5,A Classic to be read and read again.,"This book is powerful. ""As a man Thinketh"", contains knowledge that if grasped and then applied will begin the transformation of the readers life. The concepts and maxims it presents are an anchor against the storms of circumstance."
2,Is this the full version?,"I was expecting a book, not a pamphlet. Is this the concise, edited version? Or is this all there is to it?"
2,GREAT MESSAGE; POOR QUALITY,"SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS RECORDED IN A TIN CAN, NOT PROFESSIONALLY DONE, PACKAGED IN FLIMSY PAPER AND THE PRICE WAS TOO HIGH; SAD BECAUSE IT IS A WONDERFUL MESSAGE."
3,As A Man Thinketh is brief and powerful,The book is fine and accurately presents the writing of James Allen . I have seen copies of other Allen works that my colleagues have and expected it to be a little longer. These other books must have other Allen writings collected together with this powerful essay
4,"As I think, so I am. As I continue to think, so I remain.","This book has stirred a confidence in me-this confidence had been lost and only surfaced every once in a while. It plainly points out that I have control over things in my life (within reason, of course) and that the responsibility for circumstances in my life rest on my shoulders alone so it is time to stop pointing fingers at everything and everyone else. If I have good thoughts and actions; it will produce only positive results and if I have bad thoughts and actions; it will produce only negative results. This book suggests changing my thought process and through repetition great things will happen! All that a man achieves and fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts!"
2,As a Man Thinketh,"I already have this book and like the book very much. I wanted to purchase another as a gift, but was very disapointed in what I got. This came more as a little brochure and not comparable to what I already had. I recomend the book very much but would suggest anouther marketer."
1,Don't buy the CD version!,"This has to be the WORST recording ever ... the heavy accent of the person who narrates the book and his misprounciation of every 5th word makes it hard work to listen to this recording. Plus, it sounds like it was recorded in a living room -- even has fire engine sirens going off in the background. I would return it if I had the energy to do so. You're better off buying the book."
5,Great Read,This was one of the best book purchases that I have ever made. I have already read the book through twice and almost every single page is highlighted. For me it was simple and understandable but I believe you will have already needed to know some things about the topic to fully grasp the concepts. Pick this book up and begin to take control of your life by changing your thought processes!
5,Great,"Good book. Good service. Good, great, just fine. Keep up the good work. It is a pleasure doing business with you."
2,"Excellent message, overly wordy",This book has a message that everyone should read or hear. Unfortunately it is very repetitive and therefore somewhat boring.
3,Read this in high school,"Have to say, it doesn't hold up well. It's kind of a preachy book full of ideas I already know. (Remember, I did read it in high school. Plus, I have almost 50 years of post-high school experience now.) I'd say for high schoolers or older people who haven't given much thought before to just how we should conduct ourselves and evaluate our experiences, it's worth dipping into."
4,A very useful read,"If you suffer from anxiety or a deep fear, you are not alone; this is a part of the human condition. But we don't have to suffer endlessly because anxiety has an internal structure in the form of negative thoughts and beliefs powered by emotional energy that has become frozen in place. Uncover these patterns of negative thoughts and you are on the way to making significant change. As a mindfulness-based psychotherapist, I use mindfulness as the primary tool for doing just this, and I would recommend anyone to learn more about the therapeutic use of mindfulness in conjunction with good self-analysis. I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon."
2,Allen's inspirational classic sounds hokey narrated by Nash,"The wisdom of James Allen loses much of it's punch when read by narrator Billy Nash. Sounding like a fervent preacher, Nash over dramatizes the words of Allen and ends up making these simple truths sound pompous and false-hearted. Stay with the written classic and you'll get what you pay for!"
1,Messed with a classic and created a zero,"James Allen's ""As a Man Thinketh"" is an inspirational single setting read that embraces the notion your thoughts establish your destiny. Your higher thoughts pull you toward what is pure and real and your base thoughts draw you into immoral conduct and inhibit your spiritual release to fulfillment. This relationship of thought upon action impacts the companions with whom you associate and determines who is drawn to you and whom you repel. This edition destroys the simple read and truth of the words by pulling text out and seeking to emphasize portions to an extent not intended in the original version. The result is a spotty, distracting read that detracts from the power of the original work. While the photographs are attractive, the emphasis of certain text in the photographs is an overall distraction that ruins this work and makes the message banal."
3,Where's the beef?,"He has a good message, but the book is too short and has no practical aspect. A better book to put these ideas into practice is ""What to say When you Talk to Yourself"" by Shad Helmstetter."
1,Puny with typos galore!,"I was so excited to receive my copy as it's been ages since I've read this book. This is very disappointing. I don't know how they managed to get so many typos in one puny little excuse for a book. Be sure when you order, to get the original. That's what I am off to do now!"
1,Didn't do a damn thing for me,"This book can be summed up in 3 sentences:'If you think bad, bad's what you'll get.''Do the right thing.''You have the power to control your mind.'If you're looking for self help, I recommend Dr. Laura. If you're looking for philosophy of the mind, I recommend starting with Roger Penrose. Then again, for 2 bucks, if you just want to read some flowery english to make you feel 'smart,' then this book might be great for you. I think they could make more money if they put every sentence from this book on a desk calendar. so you could pull off the date and get a little message each morning.A desk calendar would at least do something useful! The fact that there are so many positive reviews for this book caused me to sit down and read it. after completing it, I fear even more for the human race.whatevaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
5,"Absolutely, totally, without a doubt INCREDIBLE!!!!!!","This is -THE- book!!!I've devoted 5 years reading 'personal development-books' and there are a lot of great ones. But this one really is far Beoyond everything else I've ever read! I put away my highlighter since I realized I would have to highlight almost every sentance in the book. Of all the books I've read, this is the only one I've cared to write a resume' about. I wrote this since I wisch all the good this book has to offer to as many people as possible.This is 100% INTENSE -MASSIVE WISDOM-!"
1,Don't buy this particular edition!,"The one star has NOTHING to do with the content of this wonderful publication, it goes without saying that anyone who has stumbled upon the genius of Allen's masterpiece knows full well that the truth is what it is, i.e. this book is sublime mastery. No, my one star simply refers to this DeVorss imprint, this veritable 'mini-book'. Sadly nowhere on the page was it explained that this was a MINI version, a pamphlet indeed. My advice, pay the extra 2~300 yen and get yourself a 'proper' copy - one that will stand up in your bookshelf. Thank you."
5,The only self help book you will ever need!,"My only regret is I wish I had read this book when I was in my twenties. Chock full of positive messages and insight into how the mind should actually work and your attitude towards life.Very Profound, I find myself listening to Mr. Allens message over and over again never getting tired of his words and direction. Although the book emphasizes mind power it also has spiritual aspects that keep you grounded and I feel It dose not impose any dogma on the reader. This book speaks to everyone regardless of race, religion or gender. Probably the best self help book I've come across, short and to the point, no fluff, everything can be digested easily. When I read this book It motivates me to take charge of my life and my attitude towards it, I hope it does the same for you!"
4,Intro to Philosophy,"A nice book for someone who wants to step out of the Chrisitian binds of philisophical thinking and move ahead (or across) to a more humanistic or individual approach, instead of worldly, and use a philosophy that has practicality. This book does not neccesarily subscribe any specific school of thought, runs it down in a very simple matter-of-fact manner which is essentialy for any human to begin thinking for themselves. The aim of this little book is to allow the student to become a practictioner in the awareness of his surroundings, speech and actions and to learn, benefit and change any process that one deems unacceptable, namely the individual. A good book, to the point and reccomended for anyone looking for a change and needs a place to start."
4,Common sense but.....,"Short read. Easy to understand. But why doesn't everyone do this? Recommended read. As others have stated, change starts with yourself before others."
4,As a Man Thinketh,I was very please with my order the delivery time and the quality of the information in the book
1,This is available for FREE,Amazon (Kindle) has it for free. Period. The work is public domain. You do not have to pay this much for an e-book version.
4,Bought as a gift,"Good price, fast delivery, pleased with the results. I did not read the book as it was a gift for someone else."
5,"Read, Think, Apply",Reading Allen feels very similar to reading passages of certain religious texts. You can tell that he speaks Truth and does so in a poetic yet succinct style. The wisdom here is worth reading and re-reading until the lessons sink in and can be applied to life. Great stuff!
2,Didn't care for,The person I bought this book for did not care for it but I do not know the reason f
4,Worth Reading,This is a short book. The book does repeat the same thing alot. I would still say it was worth reading you will walk away with something from it. I would buy this book again even after knowing what is in it.
4,Very valid thoughts from another century,I was surpised at how relevant the points and ideas were.. and they were made in a style that was old fashioned but clear and concise. This is a good book to study in school or college.
3,old thoughts revisited.,"A reminder that life's values never change, it will remain on my bed stand, I think I may pass it on to my seventeen year old grandson. A beautiful book that I genuinely have enjoyed."
2,Cliche and fanciful.,A lot of cliches made this a dull read. This could have been better if it were more scientific. Oh well.
5,Great,Its one of my favorite books. I love the author and recommend this book to everyone that wants to become better.
5,Your Thoughts Lead to Your Habits,"Since I love reading so much, it has been difficult for me to say what is my favorite book. However, given that I have carried a copy of ""As a Man Thinketh,"" in my purse, for 12 years, I'd say that this is my favorite.Whenever I have felt troubled, I have reread this book. And I always notice that as I approach the part on one day being outgrown for the shop that I was once in, I know that things are more than okay.Whenever you feel troubled, love yourself enough to find a quiet spot to read this book. In your heart, and in your life, you will feel free."
1,"You get what you pay for, almost","Bought this Clipboard to store recipes for my restaurant.It immediately failed to function correctly, not closing correctly and it got worse after that to the point the locking mechanism had to be reassembled due to the poor materials used in construction.Oh well, time to find one that works correctly."
5,Like,I like this product. I realize I already have it but I gave it to my mother who is enjoying it.Thanks
2,Not worth it,"I found the book to be cute at first, but it just keeps on piling up the fiction references. Imagine a world where everything fiction in our world existed, that's what this book is.Cute to begin with, but ultimately boring."
1,"Pales in comparison to later, greater stories","Yes, Watchmen and the Incredibles have similar stories, and the author of this book has staked a claim to being the originator of this idea. Doesn't make it better just because it came first. Shakespeare's plays are amalgamations of other earlier works, and few remember those original, inferior works. Same thing happened here. Alan Moore (along with many others) revitalized the comic industry, creating epic stories that will be remembered for ages. Superfolks is Superman with a color swap, clinging onto one idea for the brief length of the story. Read the author's review of Watchmen to glimpse a bitter, failed author who wants a little attention. It's only going to get worse with the empending release of the movie."
1,poor quality.,"cheap and poor quality, looks very thin. I think it is the way waste moneyI would not buy it again."
3,Too small,I got this to replace a former Rubbermaid dishpan that was 6-inches high. This one is shorter and I can't put enough water in it to wash larger pots and pans. I ended up getting a Sterlite 18 qt pan and it works much better for me. There's nothing wrong with the quality on this and we will probably keep it for handwashing small items of one kind or another.
4,Rubbermaid dishpan,"This is a good dishpan and fits most regular sized sinks. It is not quite as heavy as the dishpans I already have, but it does a good job."
4,highly recommended,"dont worry about its quality! I soak my feet in hot water with it, after few days use, it still seems good."
5,Rubbermaid Bisque Dishpan,Serves its purpose. Color and size I needed. I'm annoyed that you can't seem to find this color in the stores anymore. Didn't think I'd have to order a dishpan online.
4,dish pan for sink,"A bit too much money, and not quite the right color for our kitchen but it was a close match."
5,Good quality,"Good quality, so it won't crack in months, I don't think. Bought here at Amazon./\/\arty"
1,Poison for your dishes? BEWARE!,"I bought 2 of these tubs for kitchen tasks. I looked VERY carefully at the product description to see if they contained ""microban"", because I do not want poisons on/near my food/plates/kitchen utensils.The description doesn't say that these are treated, but THEY ARE!Does anyone out there know where to get tubs like this that are not laced with unnessary chemicals?"
4,more like it,"I've been VERY critical of Rubbermaid products in the past that aren't the least bit reliable, but I really can't find any faults with their dish pans. Alright maybe the one advertised here is pretty small but since it's just me in the house most of the time (since I don't believe in marriage or kids) I can't really complain about the small size of this pan. Its small size is too convenient to complain. I used to call this a dish bucket. Am I still right? Make sure you rinse the yucky water out of the pan when you're done with the dishes. Some people leave the dirty water in the pan all night and I simply don't understand why. It's gross water, and more importantly leaving the dirty water in the pain overnight opens up the risk of staining the sides. That's a big no no."
1,"I'm sure it's good, but?","With an item such as this and fairly expensive in the scheme of things, it would be really great to have a track listing!"
1,Wish I could give it MINUS 5 STARS!!!,This clock is a cute little package wrapped around the deafening ticking of a quartz movement from hell. The alarm function is moot since you will never get any sleep with this baby in the room.
2,Nice video - where are the 'problem horses'?,Nice video to watch him ride his beautiful Lusitano stallions. It would have been nice to also see him ride some 'problem horses' in a clinic to see what a difference his style makes when he rides a horse with difficulties. Too many times one has to see the same pictures of him riding around his farm. Some of the interview sections were too long - the book explains it a lot better. If I buy a video I want to see more 'hands on' material than talking. The 2 videos could have easily been combined into one and sold for less. $ 79 is definitely way overpriced for what you get.
2,"Nice video, but please don't try this at home folks!","This whole series of videos is quite lovely visually, and Barbier deserves a lot of credit for standing up for the principles of the often-misunderstood Francois Baucher and getting out hte word about lightness and harmony in riding to many people who have seen only the abuses of competitive dressage. That said .... the actual riding on these tapes is hand riding of the most severe variety, and while there are some very good things here, there are also many many things in the riding that it would be very sad to see people emulating. Enjoy the footage, enjoy the philosophy of lightness, enjoy the beautiful Lusitano horses .... but please think long and hard -- and watch video of other classical riders for comparison -- before you actually do any of this stuff!"
4,Dominique - BRAVO,"This being the companion (I believe) to his fine ""Intimacy In French Classical Dressage "" - I expected - and got- a wonderful continuation of seeing this master at work. I have read some to say that he makes it look too easy....possibly, but listen carefully - there is a wisdom about his approach that transends horsemanship.Thank-you Dominique!"
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD!!!!!!!!!!","I bought this product in January of 2007...... When I first got it I started having issues with it. I sent it in to get repaired it took about 2 months before I got one back..... The way that they work is when you send your brand new one in they send you an old repaired one back...... When I got the 1st used repaired one, I was having issues with that one as well.... I send that one back in and just recived the 3rd one... well guess what! This one doesn't work either..... I asked for a refund and they told me that it was past the refund time limit.Everytime I talked with customer service via on line chat they just say send it back, but I was told that I have up until January of 08 that they will fix them for free...... Even though I have not gotten a working one! This MP3 player is defective after my experience of getting 3.... I DON'T recommend this one....."
4,Good player.,"More user friendly than the X5, screen is nice and bright, sound quality is great, but needs to include a charger."
2,Has potential,nice toy but lacks a lot of quality. Screen looks great at first than you notice the smuge in color also device is terribly slow and 1.0 host usb that takes 120 sec to load is unusable with very limited supported devices. plays great mp3s and radio. video playback is poor.
3,Very little Citroen content in this video.,"If you are interested in this video because of Flaminio Bertoni's designs for Citroen cars, there is almost nothing in this video for you. A few minutes inside of an exhibition hall showing a few DS models, plus a couple of quotes from Bertoni about styling cars, and that's pretty much it. This video is less than 30 minutes long, and it mostly shows Bertoni's son setting up (literally...) an art exhibition about Flaminio's sculpture in an Italian High School auditorium. There is no depth to the commentary for the most part. The commentary is all in the Italian language, with awkwardly-translated English subtitles. Even as an ""art video"", this film is a bore. As a ""Citroen video"" it is just a cut above worthless."
1,Amazon should be ashamed,"This is an insightful exploration of Thomas Aquinas the man and his philosophy. But Amazon scanned the text for the Kindle version and made no attempt whatsoever to edit it -- even pre-edit clean it up. Bizarre punctuation, bizarre computer-read spellings: ""he"" often seen as ""lie"" is just one example. Few pages are without several errors and most pages have many errors. This may be the pit of western publishing as we know it. Very disturbing. Hire me, Amazon, I'll clean it up for you. / You can google this book and find it online -- properly edited."
1,Not a true book,"This is not a book, just a string of characters. There is no table of contents, no breaks for chapters or chapter titles. You can get a download with all the above elsewhere on the internet. Amazon it is not right to call this a book."
5,It's Chesterton - It Can't Be Bad,Easily the best biography/summary of thought of the Angelic Doctor that is available in the English language. When I studied philosophy in college the translations of Aquinas were a sure cure for insomnia. Chesterton has made the Saint's thought very accessible to all. A wonderful book and a necessary addition to any Chestertonian library.
3,not as rewarding as you'd think,"Ah, SWANS. This was the third record of theirs that I purchased, after the ""Great Annihilator"" and ""Greed/Holy Money"". I'm destined to make a few enemies here, but I find this album grating. It plods along... bang... bang... bang.... And is the timing purposefully off? Plus, Gira masks his wonderfully narcotic voice by doing nothing but wail. Hard to listen to. This release actually does not include their first EP, which was included on the initial CD release and was a lot, a LOT, better than ""Filth"". On, the other hand, ""Body to Body, Job to Job"" has some really good moments, and for the SWANS completist, this is a necessary purchase. For someone relatively unfamiliar with their work who wants to try some of the louder, angrier stuff, pick up ""Cop/Young God/Greed/Holy Money"" first."
5,this album is just plain excellent!!!!!,This album is awesome! each song has a wicked dub version right after the track with vocals.
5,Great buy for all fans of Jah Music!!,"Michael Rose, Puma Jones, & Duckie Simpson backed by Sly Dunbar and Robbie Sheakespeare were unstoppable. They provided us with great music, great lyrics and everlasting melodies. RASTAFARI LIVE!!"
5,If you like roots reggae GET THIS,"I have been a reggae fan for sometime now and this is one of the best albums i have ever purchased. If you like Bob Marley, Heptons or any other roots reggae groups go for this one. Other than just great reggae music, this album gives you a piece of knowlege that can be helpfull to you. One very good track on this album is ""Guess whos coming to dinner"". In this song a natty dread was invited to dinner, he came from the woods and brought a gift of herb. I reccomend this to anyone who likes roots reggae."
2,PROMISE TECHNOLOGY FastTrakSX4060 4 Channel Ultra Ata Raid Controller,doesnt support slave drive's only mastersdoesnt support x64 vista promise thinks there above everyone else too cool to make drivers
2,Poor design,"The hat looks nice, but the seam in the middle front of the hat is felt under the band, and makes the hat very uncomfortable to wear. Even after a short time, I end up with a red welt on my for-head from these caps, I would not recommend them."
5,Excellent official's cap,"This cap appears to be excellent value. Most caps are $15- $18. The very low cost makes this product a bargain. The quality and styling are completely adequate for my use. This cap fills the bill for a low cast, nice looking black cap that can be used for occasional field hockey officials work. Since I don't use it for anything else, I cannot rate it as a heavy duty cap."
1,Too small,"I know it sounds like a joke but my head was too big for this item. It was very economical but the size was simply too small to fit comfortably. I ended up giving it away. So, if you're a male with a fairly average body this hat will most likely not fit you. It just comes down to the old saying, you get what you pay for. If you pay for this, expect this to be too small for you. It may be a great hat for children or women though. So, buy with caution."
4,Nice hat.,"There really isn't too much to say about this thing. It's fairly well constructed given its price, and fits nicely."
2,"Decent design, poor quality","The leather and the material they used for this glove are great so is the way the glove is setup, but the stitching that was used is cheap and probably falls in line with their business plan (build it so it breaks so they come back for more).I had these things for about three months of rugged use and the stitching on the index finger of the glove started to come off. I thought nothing of it as it would give me a better feel for the trigger anyways (I originally wanted to cut the index finger down to half length so the padding my index finger could sit flush with the trigger). After the fourth month I had to give these glove a toss into the trash can because they had fallen apart so bad they were starting to latch into things or just get in the way.+Great setup and design of the gloves+Great quality of materials---Poor stitching and construction"
4,nice gloves,i whore these gloves for 3 months in *********** they held up very well. only complaint i have is the thumb on 1 of the gloves was a bit tight and there are no loops on the back inside the glove to hook them on your vest. a bit of cord sewn on them fixed the loop prob and a bunch o sweat fixed the other. i would buy another pair.
1,Don't buy this.,"This thing is a piece of crap. It takes well over 25 minutes to cook a frozen pizza. The beauty of a Pizza Oven is that it cooks a pizza in about 10-12 minutes without pre-heating. Not this one! You are better off using a traditional oven (it will be faster). I recommend you look for a different brand, this pizza oven is no good."
3,Pizza oven,We have had several of these over the years but this last one only lasted just long enough to be out of warrantee. will not try another one
5,nice pizza oven,I bought this pizza oven for my son who uses it often to make pizza for him and his friends. They wore out the first one that we had so ordered another.
5,Great Oven!,"Not sure why people claim it doesn't get hot enough - Frozen Pizza cooked to perfection in 8-12 minutes? That's what it does! ...and HOT! Don't touch the thing for about 45 minutes afterward because it gets REALLY hot! Mine came with the manual, although if you can't cook a pizza with one of these without the manual you better just order from Dominos! Great deal! Great pizza oven! Great price!"
3,Ok for the money,"For the price, you can't go wrong.Installation was so and so. You have to install the handle yourself, it should be a no-brainer to install, but I am unable to get the handle tight where it doesn't spin around. I played around with it for an hour, decided to add another screw, and nut at the bottom for support, otherwise in a month or two it will probably break off. Power cord is too short, like 8 inches, its a thin cord for 1,400 watts. Probably had to keep it short for safety reasons. Otherwise, it cooks pizza well, does everything it needs to be.. Just wish I didn't have to modify the handle.. And wish the power cord wasn't so short.."
3,ITS A PIZZA OVEN,IT IS EXACTLY AS IT SAID IT WOULD BE. IT IS A GOOD LIL OVEN WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO GET REAL HOT AND BAKE THE BOTTOM OF THE PIZZA. WE ALSO HAVE TO ROTATE THE PIZZA TO KEEP IT FROM BURING ON THE LEFT SIDE. I WAS VERY UNHAPPY THAT UPS JUST LEFT IT ON MY STEPS IN THE RAIN BUT THAT ISN'T THE SELLERS FAULT.
1,Not Recommended - Cheaply made and Faulty,"I did not purchase this from Amazon but it was such a bad product, I wanted to warn everyone about it. The reviews here make it look fairly good and that was my reason for purchasing it. The oven I got was damaged right out of the box with a dent in the front. Decided I could live with that but when making the first pizza, the oven shut off and timer buzzed when it was still ticking and 12 minutes left to cook. So we tried re-setting the timer and couldn't get it to heat up again. Waited awhile and tried a few more times and got it to work. This time the buzzer did not go off at all when it was done and the pizza came out completely burnt on one half and just thawed on the other. After inspecting the inside, noticed the heating element was crooked. Needless to say, we returned it the following day without any problems. I would avoid this brand at any cost. It is feather-lite construction and not worth the headache."
5,Simple and Practical,This was a very helpful book. I have never fixed a dryer before. My dryer was making a squeaking noise. I used the book to help diagnose and fix the problem. The bearing I needed was only five dollars. The book shows what the likely problems are and how to fix them.
1,"Errors, errors, errors","This is cayhoh's husband. I actually read this whole book (got it as a Christmas gift), and loved the year-by-year format and some of the neat history. But holy moly, it has so many irritating errors. 4.7-litre in a caption, photos of a supposed GT that's really some pimped-out notch. You have to go through 3 or 4 years of the last Fox bodies before you see a car that looks anything like stock. My poor wife had to endure my ranting every day, ""Geez, listen to THIS!"" So ... I'm glad I own it. It is very cool. But c'mon, spend a few bucks on an editor."
5,VISUAL PARADISE!,"Other than being truly dope, there's not much to say about Ernie Pannicioli's phenomenal book, Who Shot Ya? These pages truly capture the heart and soul of Hip Hop culture and those responsible for it. No pansy Photoshop touch-ups or cookie cutter material here, baby! Who Shot Ya delivers, bringing us chock-full-of-flavor in every page. Pannicioli immortalizes a lot of his subjects in their natural state; albeit, at times too raw for it's viewer. Ernie is the consumate documentor of urban/Hip Hop culture and Who Shot Ya? represents a visual tour into this man's unique body of work. Along with books like: Subway Art, Hip Hop (out of print) and Back In The Days, Who Shot Ya? is as invaluable as the culture that inspired it. --James ""Koe"" Rodriguez"
5,Loved this book!,"I am so happy I bought this book, it was my first lesbian novel but definitely not the last. I loved both characters especially Kelly Sambino whom I thought was great and very understanding about the whole situation with Jo. I think the way she stayed by Jo`s side even when she rejected her so many times was just amazing.The story was awesome!! The sex was just hot, hot, hot! the minute I finished it I borrowed it to my girlfriend. I think Gerri Hill wrote a wonderful book..."
2,Boring!,"Romantic story of how Jo hesitates to get into a relationship with a steamy young woman whose feelings for her are more than Jo can manage. I found the story a little slow and ""going around in circles"": repetitions of how Jo was hurt by her ex Nancy, how she is lonely, has very few friends, and keeps rejecting a persistent Kelly. Not the best lesbian love story out there."
5,Reading It Again...,"Fun and light with lots of sexy tension between the two main characters. The softball scenerio was cute and typical...I think we've all been there, right? This book was short, and a quick read, but I loved it. I actually started reading it again the same day I finished it...just because."
3,Cute but Tiresome,"I have read more lesbian fiction than I care to admit. One Summer Night was certainly not the worst of the bunch, nor was it the best. I am not sorry I read it, nor would I have been sorry I bought it (my girlfriend actually made the purchase).I found the last 40 or so pages of the book to be tiresome. It was the same old back-and-forth, will they or won't they that every romance novel incorporates to an extent. The trouble was that I feel like Hill ran out of things to say and so she dragged out the ending with the on-again, off-again. It got old. When it came to the actual end of the book, it felt rushed to me.Still, I found the characters to be enjoyable, the scenarios realistic, and it was a quick, easy read."
4,Not what I expected in a she/she romance book but...,"My first she/she romance novel and although it is not what I expected in this genre...I still thought ""ONE SUMMER NIGHT"" by Gerri Hill, was a very good story!"
5,Schreiber Shines,"With a four octave range, and brilliant songwriting skills, Julie Schreiber has made ""To Dreaming"" one of the best independent releases of the year. There is absolutely no weak aspect to this album. The energy is relentless and every track has a unique and exuberant groove. The original songs are intelligently written: Catchy melodies, sincere lyrics and fabulous harmonies. This is definately the most listened-to CD of my collection, and I recommend everyone to add it to theirs."
3,Tragedy in Mite World,"Bob Overdog is a petty villain locked up in Arkham Asylum. When Bane attacks and blows up the Asylum, Bob manages to escape. While on the lam he meets Bat Mite who turns to him for help. His home dimension is being taken over by Bane Mite and he needs a hero. Bob becomes that hero.Action moves to Bat Mite's world and we see how Bane Mite is taking over. But while Bob manages to overcome Bane Mite and save an entire dimension, in our home dimension he dies without anyone knowing he had reformed and become a hero.To really appreciate this story you have to be able to tolerate Bat Mite and have a knowledge of the Knightfall sequence in Batman. The parallels are well done and the story manages to not be too cute. It is actually quite dark. Bob's position as the unknown hero is a classic in literature and is handled very well in this tale."
2,Overly ambitious,"I had hoped this chonicle of twenty-one discoveries would be pentetrable by the intelligent, but not specialized reader.I was disappointed.The introductions to the articles reprinted from Nature are sometimes more dense then the articles themselves - and occasionally nothing more than songs of praise for Nature having printed the article.Many of the Nature articles are simply beyond the comprehension of the reader who is untrained in the subject.Probably a fine book for those with deep scientific credentialing, but not necessarily so for the intelligent layperson.Jerry"
2,Ultra Poor Value,"I do noy know why Sony would want to make a bedroom TV that costs close to three hundred dollars.It just does not make sense.For this kind of money,you could buy a 27-inch RCA TV with seven more inches and seventy dollars less.Maybe the quality of the Sony is good,but to me,it is not worth it."
3,Not good for watching DVDs,"The picture is not bright enough to bring out details in a dark background. Especially when you watch a night scence in a DVD movie, you cannot clearly see the actors' faces. I would recommend your buying a JVC or Panasonic if you want to enjoy movies."
3,Enjoyable Light Read,"I felt like Tim O Connor was sitting right next to me, talking to me. Reading this book is like having a conversation with an older, wider friend. It's an enjoyable, but not particularly memorable read. If you've read many personal development books, then you won't find anything new or remarkable in this book. It does serve as a good reminder of what you already know, but may not be applying in your life."
2,Cubs Hat,"What appeared to be a good quality hat became a disappointment rather quickly. Some of the stitched air holes are already missing after 6 short weeks. Son wears it regularly, however not excessively."
3,Not What I Expected,"After reading Beyond Love and City of Joy, I expected this to be just as good. Two third of the book is interesting - although I discovered what a prejudice author this is - but the nearer I got to the end of the book, the more disappointed I was. I expected a great ending, instead I found a very slow one."
3,Disappointed,"I have read almost all of Lapierre's books and loved them. They were vivid, well-researched and absolutely riveting. But this book seems dated. He takes old pieces and pieces them into a book. We've been there."
2,Décevant,Je suis un grand fan de Burning Spear. Cet album m'a beaucoup décu. Mr Rodney n'a que très peu de feelings sur ce disque et je crois que le band était trop préoccupé d'avoir un bon son. Cet album est à mon avis un des moins bon de l'artiste. Il serait préférable de se précurer MARCUS GARVEY ou encore THE FITTEST OF THE FITTEST qui rend mieux l'expérience Burning spear.
2,Still not sure,"Very nice design and fits into landscape perfectly. However, I'm not sure about the effectiveness. I don't find many mosquitos in the trap, but they are definitely still flying around. It seems like the fan does not have enough power to suck anything larger than a small gnat."
1,Pure garbage,Pure garbage. Not much more to say. Had to give it 1 star because I could not give it 0.
4,Good Read,"Except for some grammer errors, I really enjoyed this book. It goes to show that all relationship have problems and either you work through them or you walk away. MHVL was a very good read. Keep up the good work."
1,Cheap & Tawdry,"When I looked for a scintilla of evidence of the diaries and quotes attributed to Attilie, or an iota of historical documentation to substantiate a romantic relationship between Douglass, all I found was an alleged fact that she left her valueless estate to him. The author didn't even tell me where I could fact check that. She pimped Douglass's name to sell a book. Her imagination belongs in an Enquirer article."
2,Biracial Harlequin Romance,The book was an easy read but it consisted of a lot of bed hopping circa 1800s. Not my thing.
5,Beautifully written,Couldn't put this book down. This was one of the best books I have read. I see Fredrick Douglass in a whole new light.
2,photo did not represent candy received,"I am very, very disappointed. I bought myself the white chocolate almond bark as a present to myself for giving birth to my 42 year old son. The advertising photo showed whole almonds. The candy I received had not one, NOT ONE, whole almond. There was just crushed nut slivers. Absolutely not what I was expecting for the price I paid. Chocolate was of good quality but don't expect it to look like the photo."
5,Beginning Microwave Amplifier Design - This is the Book!,"I read the first edition, half the size, half the examples, and had to polish up on the calc. The second edition makes up for this and more. This is the definitive reference for all who are interested in microwave amplifier design with no previous experience. The Smith Chart approach follows the more academic derivations, which proves to be fast and easy. There is enough informatation to get one started on basic narrow band small signal gain, basic power configurations, and limited oscillator circuits. Buy this book before venturing on to more complex designs. You won't be disappointed."
3,Examples hard to follow - spotty explanations,Some examples hard to follow. Some problems unrelated to previous study material. Very spotty book in the way it relays information. Would not recommend it.
3,big...,"It would have been helpful if they had said just how big this was. 10.5 oz? Is that weight or volume?This is my first encounter with ""DampRid"". I didn't really know what to expect. These pouches are huge. I can make them work, but they're huge. My application is a fire safe. It's water-tight (so they claim), and mold has a tendency to grow in such places. So I went searching for a dessicant. This one was recommended by a few people, and the reviews seemed favorable.So far it seems to be working. But the space is so small the pouch is really over-kill. Once I've used these up I'll see if I can find a smaller version."
1,leaked and destroyed valuable items,"These bags leaked and destroyed valuable items. Although a $300 pair of boots and many other items were destroyed, I might be able to salvage a few things. Does anyone know what I could use to remove the stains? They remain wet and have a strong chemical odor. Please don't buy these packets."
4,Simple,"The moisture absorbing material is pretty good, after it absorbs water it dissapears and you have a bag with some brown stuff in it. almost like a fungus, but it doesn't smell. toss the bag and thats it. It works well for enclosed, smaller areas."
4,I always use Damprids,"I always seek out Damprids at whatever home center I am at for the bathroom areas in particular, the product works well."
5,It works!!,"Currently, there are just too many products that those of us, raised before the advent of modern teachnology, have no clue about. This ""moisture reducing"" offering does just what it claims with no complicated instructions. Hurrah!!"
5,This product really does work well,"We have a small room converted to an office, on the second story of our house. The room does not have the best circulation, and in the middle of the summer (hot and humid days) it got really damp feeling in there.Based on a recommendation from a Home Depot associate, decided to give DampRid a try -- and have been very happy ever since. We put the container in the room, and about every few weeks or so we dump out more than a cup full of water down the drain. These refills do the same job that the original pack did, and the room feel and smells much better now.Guess we will have to figure out why the issue occurs (maybe need to replace the 13 year old windows seals?), but until then these do the job."
1,Terrible,The writer simply cannot write prose. Her attempt at metaphors are terribly jarring. I have never come across a published writer who was so bad.Terribly disappointing as I love Frieda Fromm-Reichmann and have read her work with fascination and joy.
1,Too dark,"I found this book way too depressing. The author seemed to make a point that Dr. Frieda was not the saint she apeared to be in the famous book from Greenburg. In every sentence, it was reaking with some pessimistic streak, even in the depictions of the many photos I found fascinated by. I love Greenburg's book dearly, and to just know such a person as Dr. Fried existed was enough to give light to this world. I think the author of this book should have mentioned more of the fact that Friada did accomplish an enourmous amount... It was awful how the author refrained Frieda's untimely death over and over and over again, as if her life had a sad fate, despite all that she strived for. Even her work with the real Johanna Greenburg is underminded, immediately followed by a whole chapter about a patient she was unsuccessful to reach out.Not recommended, although it is the only existing book I know about her, and I rushed to the library to get it as soon as I knew it was out. Too bad."
3,Nice enough,Smoldering Plum is a very universally flattering shade. It works for my tanned skin as well as lighter skin tones (ladies at the gym). Last a good 4-6 hours. I've since upgraded to more lasting brands.
4,Good movie minus the pornography,"Let's just call it what it is, most modern movies are basically pornographic because we've become desensitized and don't value sex anymore. That said, this is a great little movie and at least shows the consequences of promiscuous sex, unlike most American films which glorify it."
3,science curriculum,"Great book. However, geared more towards upper elementary of middle students. Not enough material for lower elementary,Great price! good product to have in school library,"
5,jump nyabingi,Someone played this cd for me once and I was in tears because I had never heard bingi or been to one yet. The sprit that comes from the music is so beautiful. The recording sound isnt the ultimate but its done well enough. I play this when Im chantin psalms or sometimes in meditation.
2,"If you've never seen it, try before you buy","We'd heard this show was hilarious, so I bought it. If you liked PoliceSquad and the related movies, When Things Were Rotten and other Mel Brooksworks, you may find this amusing. If those don't tickle your funny bone, andyou're still curious about this show, I recommend renting or borrowing itfirst. There were a few lines here and there and only a couple of scenesthat were funny. Most of it was so predictable, we were falling asleep. Toomany times they worked a gag to death so that what little humor there was inthe beginning was long gone and we wanted them to move on. The actors werefine in their roles. We can enjoy a good parady, but didn't find this showto be in that catagory."
3,So so...,"The reading is alright. The chapters are short but the examples are confusing, most of the steps are cut out leaving the reader to figure out what was done. I wouldn't recommend this book if someone is really trying to learn vibrations."
1,The Absolute Worst,"This is easily the poorest excuse for a textbook that I have ever had the misfortune of reading. The entire book reads as though a couple of first year grad students scrapped it together in the span of a week or two. The author picks the absolute simplest, most specific problems to use as examples, and skips most of the steps needed in the derivation. The homework problems are vague, don't give proper parameters, use different terms than those given in the reading, and sometimes the answer deck doesn't even have the right answer. If you are like me, and prefer to learn out of the book than pay close attention in lecture, then do not even bother with this book, find another one and photocopy the problems from a friend. Professors: do not torture your students with this book, its not worth the paper its printed on, much less the asking price."
1,Hard.,"This book is very difficult to read and although you need to know a lot of physics to get to this point, the book does nothing to help expand your knowledge. It is difficult with very few examples that don't pertain to the problem sets at the end of the chapter. Some of the sections are a mere two to three pages long, which is definitely not enough information. What they explain are basic spring and mass problems, but when it comes down to it, these examples are just too basic to apply to homework or test problems. I would not recommend this book but if it is one that you are stuck with for a class, rely heavily on your professor or teaching instructor instead of the text."
1,No.,"I got this book because it was required for a class. If at all possible, stay away from this book.This book likes to explain the basic algebraic steps while completely bypassing the important steps required to actually solve the problem. The text is written very poorly, it reads like a foreign written instruction manual, and the examples leave much to the imagination.Avoid at all costs."
1,Terrible book,"The coverage is spotty at best, very much like ""swiss cheese"" as another reviewer pointed out. Their are very few examples, and they are poorly worked out. In addition, the exercises somehow expect you to know material never even covered in the text and are nigh unsolvable unless you already have experience with vibration theory or a copy of the solution manual (also very poorly written).It is extremely difficult for beginners and not terribly useful as a reference either. Overall one of the worst texts I've ever had to use."
4,Little Bites Dog Food from Amazon,"Purina LITTLE BITES is economical and my miniature poodle seems to like it and be able to eat it without difficulty. He's 10 years old with a few dental issues and needs tiny, easy to chew bites."
4,Good price!,My little Pom loves this food! He refuses to eat anything else. The morsels are small enough for him to chew and not too crunchy. This item is a good price for the size as well. I will buy again.
1,"Not worth it, even for free","I borrowed Medusa's Tae-Kickbox Workout DVD from a friend who did not recommend it, and did NOT want me to return the DVD to her. After trying the workout, I was so disgusted that I simply threw the DVD away. Champion kickboxer does not equal good instructor. Medusa needs to work on her timing, cuing, instructional explanations, and choreography."
3,good technics for self defense but not good for areobics.,The instructer is very encouraging but the moves are good for defense and condfidence but if you are looking for a cardio thing this not your kinda tape.
2,"Should Be Renamed ""Airlines Serving LAX""","Name change required.With much expectation and joy, I picked up this book at a local bookstore hoping to find info about the airport layout and architecture. Flipping one page after another, pictures of airlines and aircrafts with careful captions, my joy slowly dwindled and turned to disappointment. Pictures and captions are all nicely done except this is not what I want.""LAX: Los Angeles International Airport"" should be renamed ""Airlines Serving LAX"". This is more or less a field guide showcasing all the major airlines operating out of the airport. There is not even one blueprint on the airport layout, runways and passenger terminal. Had it not titled LAX, I wouldn't even bother to pick it up from the shelf."
2,Donner Pass,I was just at Donner Pass. This movie is nothing like what really happened at Donner Pass
1,It didn't happen,"As the title states, it purports to be a nonfiction. The unsuspecting viewer may be lured into thinking that they are actually viewing an event that happened in our early history when in reality, they are watching a fiction. This DVD should be titled anything except ""The Donner Party"" but then again, the maker would not be able to cash in on the namesakes actual tragedy that did take place."
2,Dissapointing,"Although the actors were fine, the film did very little to portray the real conditions that the Donner party experienced. In reality the snow at times was so deep that walking was impossible. Also it was historically innacurate - although to be fair it advertises the film as 'based' on a true story - so I suppose they have added some drama by including murder into the story.Read the book called 'Ordeal By Hunger' by George Stewart if you want all the true facts. There was one man called Keseberg who was suspected of killing a young child - but only suspected. Then there was a man killed in a fight long before they were trapped in the mountains. The bodies that were eaten were all people who succumbed to hunger and cold - not murder victims.This could have been a really good film, especially as it was actually made in Donner Pass, but seemed to have been poorly put together."
2,Poor,"Boring movie. No historic value, no action, no horror elements. It's all about canibalism, but movie takes it on psychological level."
2,donner party,"I bought this because i am a fan of Christian Kane and Clayne Crawford.Kane is in the movie for about 5 minutes, Crawford for most of the movie.Sorry the best part of the whole movie was the end."
2,Mr. Barbier - come back.,"Mr. Barbier's Mastering the Basics video was an audio delight. His attitude and approach to lightness and partnership can serve to be an inspirational message to trainers who struggle daily with horses that, through previous forceful methodology, have become lumbering, difficult and resistant. Unfortunately the visual elements of this particular video, at best do not compliment and at worst mock the enlightening narration. His horses appear compressed and over-bent and traveling too much sideways to deliver a light ride. His instruction, although pleasant to listen to, is unproductive and his riding seems thoroughly contradictory to what he is saying. I have had the pleasure of watching his previous videos and they are far superior to this decimation of what used to be the purity of his French Classical work. I fear he has sold out in order to be more commercial. I hope this is not true."
3,Great Philosophy- But!,"Mr. Barbier's philosophy is wonderful to hear and highly recommendable. Regretfully, my praise must end there as the visuals in this video clearly demonstrate that old ""do as I say, not as I do"" principal. We are treated to visions of lovely horses being over bent in the neck, compressed into their shoulders by pulling hands (both his and his students) and horses who cross over their hind legs instead of bringing them forward in the shoulder-in. Mr. Barbier's first video was the reason I pursued Classical French Dressage in the first place (for which I must thank him). What a pity he has chosen to allow ""modern techniques"" to dictate his current methodology. Save your money and buy his ""Intimacy in French Classical Dressage"" instead."
3,Tweezers,"I have tweezerman tweezers, that's why I chose these! Mine were made in Germany, so I think the quality was a bit better."
5,"Practical, functional and reasonably priced","When you need 'em, you can't see to ever find 'em and these tweezers help with that. Who can't find a pair of bright yellow tweezers in a cluttered cabinet or drawer! Good quality product that does what it's supposed to do and at a good price."
4,Great,These are great tweezers and especially for those stubborn hard to get in-grown hairs. Just be aware that they are not great for normal everyday tweezing
2,Not sharp enough and arrived with misaligned heads,This item is not as pointy and sharp as one would think. Actually the heads were kinda blunt. Also they arrived brand new with misaligned heads. Huge disappointment. Returned for refund.
2,loyola133,I thought that these tweezers were ultra sharp...perhaps a little too sharp. Even when I got the hair perfectly... the tweezers would act like scissors and cut it leaving little hair left for me to grab. It's more than a little frustrating. I also found that mine aren't perfectly aligned so even when I'm right on top of a hair it wont' grab it because the point is so specific. I think this tool is perfect to dig down to your ingrown hair and try to bring it above your skin surface and then use another pair of tweezers to actually pull it.
1,Works worse than a needle,"In the past, I've used a needle for ingrown hairs or regular tweezers. I thought these tweezers would work better but they don't. These are actually less effective and cause more damage. Because of their thickness, it rips the skin around the hair which can cause scarring more so than a needle and regular tweezers. It's basically like using a thin nail to dig the hair out or at least that's what it felt like using them. These were a complete waste of time and money for me and added nothing to the process of digging out an ingrown hair."
1,wish I'd saved my money,"Not the kind of tweezer that gets those little hairs in your magnifying mirroras one reviewer stated. The tip is too blunt for that, at least for me anyway."
1,These suck!!!,"These tweezers are not any better than regular tweezers, it is very difficult to get them to grab the hair, the only thing i accomplished with them is some unwanted cuts and bleeding from trying to grab ingrown hairs. really wish i hadnt bought these."
4,These are a must if you epilate,"My daughter and I both use an epilator so ingrown hairs are an issue. I bought these tweezers for me a couple years ago. They keep disappearing to my daughter's bathroom so I recently bought her a pair. I am a bit clumsly and have dropped these a few times onto my slate floor. The tips bend easily. They no longer ""tweeze"" like they did originally, but still work for loosening ingrown hairs then I remove with the regular tweezers."
5,Exactly what we were looking for!,"We've purchased several so-called needle-tipped tweezers; always to come away disappointed. Either the tips didn't meet perfectly or were too wide (not a true needle-tip) or they were flimzy. This is not a good situation to be in when you're attempting to pull a tiny glass-shard out of your foot as was the case with me recently. The shard was so tiny my wife couldn't even see it but I sure could feel it! We had a lousy set of tweezers and gave up with them she had to come up with a ""plan B"". THIS pair, however, is perfectly aligned, needle-tipped and strong. I definitely recommend this model/brand tweezer and will be revisiting Tweezerman for our future Tweezing needs as well. A little more costly but, alas, sometimes you need to ""get what you pay for""."
1,Not very impressed,"These tweezers seem to have a hard to holding onto ingrown hairs on my neck. As a result they sometimes will clip part of the hair, making it shorter and harder to pull out."
5,Tweezerman,"These Tweezerman tweezers are hands down the best tweezers I have ever used. Incredible accuracy and can penetrate spots where deep ingrown hairs lie. I was skeptical at first about spending $10 on a pair of tweezers, coming from spending less than a couple of dollars for past tweezers but they are fully worth it and it is available for a great price here on Amazon. I highly recommend them."
4,Tweezers,"These must be one of the best, if not the best Ingrown Hair Tweezers i have ever bought i would recommend these they are great , once again I thank Amazon ."
2,Disappointed,"These tweezers can hardly pull out a hair that isn't under the skin. They can puncture the skin, I suppose, but that is really about it."
3,splinter tweezer,"a nice tool, very fine point. works fairly well. always a good thing to keep in the cabinet as inevitably you'll need it"
1,Didn't work as advertised.,"I'm a male and often have ingrown hairs. I own Revlon tweezers which I purchased long time ago from Target. They work pretty well for most ingrown hair and grab the hair very firm.The problem with Revlon is though that first I have to slightly free the hair from the surrounding skin using a needle or other sharp tool.I purchased the Tweezerman tweezers based on mostly positive reviews, but I was not able to use them for ingrown hairs. The tip is sharp and thin. The tweezers either cut or fail to grab the hair. When I tried harder, they would cut the skin, cause bleeding and make more harm. They are pretty much useless.Unfortunately I missed the window for return."
3,"great tweezers, but not as strong as they say they are~","these tweezers are really nice for getting out ingrown hairs of splinters. however, they are not as sturdy as they appear. if the tip gets bent, they no longer work properly. i have no idea what happened to mine to bend them as they are always in my makeup bag, but they did, and now the ends don't touch enough in order to tweeze hairs. i haven't contacted tweezerman yet about a possible replacement since it's only a lifetime sharpening for free."
1,"Sent in to get sharpened, never returned!","I bought a 2 pack of ""Tweezerman"" it said you can send them back for life to get sharpened. I sent them 4-28. It's now 7-4. Guess I'll never get them."
1,The tip will eventually bends and become useless,"I ordered these tweezers from Amazon. They arrived bent. Without any hassle, Amazon shipped a replacement."
1,NOT needle point,"I need needle point tweezers and that's what I tought I was getting. These are not what I expected, especially from Tweezerman. I'm disappointed in these."
2,Not as good as other Tweezerman tweezers,I loved my old stainless steel Tweezerman splinter remover. It was not yellow like this one. This one is not as good.
1,Expensive for typical & shipping SLOW,"For an item that ended up being the same as your department or drugstore offering, it was expensive and nothing more than ordinary. Plus the company took more than a week in an off-season time to ship the tiny item. It is February...not like Christmas where I would understand."
3,Okay tweezers,"I think these are okay, but I prefer a different pair. These don't grab as well as other tweezers I have so I probably wont reorder these."
2,It has no grip,and it loses its sharpness fastthey say you can send it in for free to be resharpened but that's a lot of trouble when the sharpness gets used up so quickly.
3,Not very good,"Good for extracting the hair under the skin, but the needle tips end up snapping the hair when you try to tweeze it outSo I use a combination, this to unlodge the hair, and another product to actually pull the hair out."
5,Contacs and eyelashes,"I wear contacs and I will get these extremely fine eyelashes that grow under my eyelash line and poke/irritate my eyes. I can only see these eyelashes with a flashlight, they're so fine. They slip between any tweezers I've ever used. But THESE tweezers were my lifesaver. They grip even the finest hair. You won't be sorry."
2,Not sharp,"I bought these for removing splinters. The tip is not that sharp, and certainly not what I expected. Good for tweezing brows or something like that, but you should use a more sharply pointed tweezer for removing splinters."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!,"This is by far the most impressive ingrown hair tweezer that I have ever used. The tip is perfectly pointed and equally sharp, which is required for precise removal. Perfect!!"
2,Not as good as I thought they'd be,"These tweezers are VERY sharp and seem like they'd be great at removing ingrown hairs, however they perform about as well at removing tough-to-get hairs as my other Tweezerman tweezers. They're decent, but not great. They might be really good at removing larger things like splinters, but I haven't had to try that yet. Overall they're not a bad purchase, just don't expect anything special as far as tricky ingrown hairs are concerned."
3,good but service?,I requested yellow but got silver... I whould have just bought it at CVS or any pharmacy store. Little things matter
3,tweezers,"bought this originally for eyebrows but a regular tweezer is be able to do the same job. could live without it for eyebrow purposes, its probably better for splinters etc..."
4,Tweezerman Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze (8 out of 10),"Tweezerman is not the perfection (i gave it 8 out of 10)The problem with Tweezerman that whenever you start using it, you will get addicted to use it in such a way you destroy your facial looking somehowbut in general, it is way better than the normal tweezersThe shipment delivery was fast (about 1 week - 10 days) to Sweden, which is away faster than the ones on ebaythe shipment fees is really expensive relative to other couriers on other websites, like ebay"
2,Not what I expected,"I really was hoping for something very precise. These have a nice point but they are not as small at the tip as I had hoped. The tip is certainly much larger than the Revlon Platinum Tweezer Slant Tip, which I have included in an image next to the Tweezerman - Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze.I am currently using these for crafting, which they are actually perfect for. Anytime I need to grab something fine like a bead or brad they really do the trick. They are also great for small stickers or stamped images or pretty much anything else. If they were advertised for this, I would give them 5 stars. As tweezers they fall a little short.I hope this helps!"
1,Didn't work at all,Tried this for a splinter once and couldn't get it to grip at all. I normally love Tweezerman tweezers - maybe I got a defective one?
5,Great general-purpose tweezers,"I purchased a pair of these tweezers to help me fix a very delicate gold chain necklace that had gotten tangled. No other tool in the house was effective, but once I got these, I was able to fix the necklace very easily.What makes these tweezers so great is that they have a sharp tip that is very good at holding on to whatever it grabs. They also hold their shape (i.e. they don't bend) like other tweezers do. I use these tweezers now for all my ""tweezing"" needs.I think everyone should have a pair of these tweezers on hand."
1,Not the Same as the Old Splintertweeze,"I bought these tweezers to replace my old Tweezerman Splintertweeze tweezers. They are not the same at all. The tips are not nearly as pointed (too wide to use precisely) or as flush (won't grasp well). I have always sworn by Tweezerman, but it seems like the quality of their products has really been declining lately. Being fairly clumsy I often ruin my tweezers by dropping them, and it seems like each replacement pair I buy is worse than the last. I bought my first Splintertweeze because I was sorely disappointed by a very dull pair of Point tweezers that I bought to replace my old ones, and now this new Splintertweeze is almost as bad as those Point tweezers were! I am sure that somebody who is used to drugstore tweezers would probably find these a nice upgrade, but if you're used to Tweezerman quality, beware. It ain't what it used to be."
2,*not* a needle point!,"It doesn't grasp a ingrown hair at all I have to dig out the ingrown hair with a needle then I can grab the hair with this product. if you are wanting something that can dig the ingrown hair out this wouldn't be the right product for you, the so called point isn't really a point it's squared off and just doesn't grasp the small hair."
1,Didn't work for me,I resort to a pin and my regular tweezers for ingrown hairs. These are difficult to use and make it easy to stab yourself. Good for other people who can use them - I really wanted these to work.
3,Not an easy read,I liked it but it was difficult to read on the train.Maybe I should have read it in a place where I could be able to really absorb the material.It was drawn out.
5,A contemporary topic (in 19th century prose),"Thanks to a string of Hollywood's idiotic executives focused on cheap thrills, decades of bonehead movies have used Frankenstein in their title, but have kept nothing of the original story. As a result, readers that grab this title seeking a horror story (gory or not) stand to be disappointed. Mary Shelley's story, which must be read in full appreciation of the style and sensibilities of the 19th century, is actually the sad story of a creature rejected by its creator. Love and love denied, revenge and forgiveness, rejection and acceptance, right and wrong - and how human judgment is tainted by appearances. In a century where image is all and beauty is mistaken for intelligence, Frankenstein's story is all too contemporary."
5,The first work of science fiction,"Mary was a truely great woman, braving heavy literary snobbery, her own tradgic personal life, social and moral opression to write not only a classic work of literature, but also the first ever science fiction story. A revolutionary of her time and a genius writer with a full and budding imagination."
4,Frankenstein,"Frankenstein is a classic book that everybody is aware about. However, to me the actual story was unclear for example: the creation was named after the Doctor, Frankenstein. From the start Dr. Frankenstein was a scientist and found ways to make inanimate objects become animate. From this Frankenstein was born from old apendages unporportionate to the body. After becoming deathly ill Dr. Frankenstein relized the mistake he had made creating such a monster and quickly went to destroy it. The beast had actually run away and was surviving in the wilderness and spying on a family before he was shooed away and his emotions began to take place. Meeting up with Frankenstein the doctor quaralled with him and reconsideration of his thoughts take place as he decides what to do with the monster that he has created."
4,Great classic book,"To me this book was great. At times it can be hard but not very often. It has a lot of deeper psychological meanings and thoughts if you take time to analyze this characters. It is a book basically about a struggle of good v. evil, but who really is the evil one, the monster or Frankenstein?"
4,this book is very interesting and enjoyable,"Mary Shelley did a phenominal job with this book. The fact that it was only meant as a time-passer adds to the books power. The story is very well defined, and there are no hard places to follow. There are however, a few places that could be cut with no harm being done to the novel. That is to be expected with every book though. The true feelings of all of the characters can be felt throughout. Most everyone thinks of the monster as being just that, a terrible, hideous monster. That isn't the way Mary Shelley meant for him to be veiwed as though. His feelings can be felt, and they are profound. Shelley's Frankenstein is a great book. READ IT!"
4,Unexpected,This book is profound. It is unlike the story from the horror movie; you delve into the characters and find out the reasons for the monster's fury. I recommend it to everyone!
4,Frankenstein,"I read Franenstein for a Senior English class in High School. To be honest, i wasn't personally expecting much from this book. I thought it would be a plain horror story. I had in my head a story that was simply about a monster killing people. After reading this book i realized that I was wrong! This book brought out many emotions within me. I found it very insubstantial that Victor had even created a monster. There is much more to this book than that fact. It was difficult to not feel pitty for both Victor and his monster. I would, and already have, recommended this book to a range of readers."
2,"Good Idea, Poor Conversion From Idea To Words","The idea of the book was very intelligent and interesting, dealing with rights and wrongs, accomplisments, actions and there consequences. But the book, to me, was written poorly. When reading the novel, my mind always wandered becasue of the dragging on of events. It used difficult language, uncommon words, and was saturated with too many words. The 160 page novel could have easily been shrinked down into an 100 page story. It was repititive in its ideas and difficult to concentrate on. It's not the worst book I've read for school, but I would definelty not read this book in my leisure time."
5,Frankenstein,"Mary Shelly says it like no one else. I thought Tolstoy had the most profound writing talent before reading this book.Usually I read to kill time but this book had me make the time. In my 52 years, this has been the book that I couldn't wait to get back to. I'm deeply impressed and so happy that I chose this timeless classic."
4,Great for students on a budget,"I was taking an online literature class, and almost all the books were in the public domain, but reading on screens strains my eyes, Dover was a life saver!"
4,A Classic!,"This is Mary Shelley's best (only?) work. Originally titled ""The Promethean Man,"" this book is about grotesque science experiments into what many religious folks would call ""God's territory."" If you do not know what Frankenstein is about, then you probably don't care anyway, though."
2,Frankenstein,"I found the story Frankenstein a pretty dark story. It was totally different of a tale than I had expected. My impression of the book Frankenstein was based on ""The Munsters"" show with the green dark haired giant with screws holding his head on. In the book you don't get that vision of him."
5,One of my favorites,"This novel is one of my all-time favorite books. I was surprised by the humanity of the Monster; the traditional portrayal of Frankenstein is usually a bumbling stumbling monster, and Mary Shelley's real creation is nothing of the sort. The book is exciting, thought-provoking, and holds your attention until the very end. Read it on a stormy day."
4,Amazing work of art,Her command and artful use of written language is truly amazing. Complex emotions are described with expressive clarity and detail. I loved how Shelly focused on the monster's strong desire to be loved and his attempts to reciprocate with compassion.This is a painful and sad story to the end but worth the time and effort.
4,More than a monster story,"Shelley's novel is so much more than a story about a monster. The whole mood of her novel is electrifying and startling. The sensation is similar to arriving at the very edge of a mountain precipice, gazing down, and feeling the enormity of life rush over you. This sense of vertigo is one of Shelley's gifts. She has the wild writer's mind and she can deliver the chills. One could argue her shocking sense of life was very similar to the later wildly popular french philosopher Jean Paul Sarte, and the theme of his sudden realization of the horror of existence. Shelley's gothic novel written in the age of romance has elements of both styles. But, it's her wild mind that makes this novel eerie, extraordinary and amazing. (Read intently and thoughtfully for best results.)"
5,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a beautiful commentary.,"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a beautiful commentary on many moral issues which are still debated today. My students have just finished reading the novel and we decided to write this review together. They wanted to let other students know that even though the language is tough, the story is interesting and the topics are timeless. Many students found the story of the creature to be truly heartbreaking. In conclusion, they give it two thumbs up!"
4,Good,"Well crafted story, a classic that I'd never read - enjoyed it . Would recommend it as a read for anyone"
5,One of the original science fiction novels.,"While this was called a horror novel by some, it is really one of theearliest science fiction novels. It is about a scientist who brings a manconstructed of body parts to life. The monster is very different fromthose portrayed in most of the movies based on this book. He can speak,reason, etc, but is still horrific. A great novel, a classic, how else todescribe it. Of course it is written in archaic language, but it is stillgreat literature and something everyone should read at least once."
5,A True Masterpiece,"The name Frankenstein is quickly recognized by everyone, though not everyone has read the actual story. Thus, most people confuse the fact that Frankenstein isn't the name of the monster, but rather the man who created the monster. This story is the perfect example of a horror story and thriller while having a hint of a love theme. Mary Shelley has an excellent story attributed to her name. The reader will quickly fall in love with Frankenstein and his monster if they truly understand the situations they must endure and conquer. Frankenstein is a classic that should be read by anyone who hasn't already.Zachary B. MedinaAuthor of Decador"
5,Memories Awesome!,"I Remember reading this as a girl. Great book! Can't get over it, Many Thanks for the Publishers for bringing back this timeless classic. 5 stars all the way."
3,Frankenstein version for sure,"Well, I read it, I thought it exceedingly boring. But.. The writing is fair at times, if inconsistent, and a classic is a classic. The writing can be incredibly boring in long, long stretches, and the ""depth"" of the book, its Moral, (even being well known and obvious before reading the book)is worn out long ago. I thought I might see something more to it than what was already known, but amazingly, there was less."
3,"Excellent plot, But tended to drone on one thing for to long","This was an excellent read with a twisting and turning plot. That made you afradi of the dark at night and found yourself looking behind your back during the day. But Mary Shelley tended to drone and she tended to turn an excellent plot into a boring one. This novel does teach you valuable lessons about life and human nature, that are fascinating and intriuging. Overall this was a good book that would have been better with a more experienced author and less complicated writing."
3,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein:,"Yes, since the story was written a while ago, the language and slowness do tend to become tiresome at times. However, the actual meaning of the story is quite important (especially because of who wrote it and when SHE wrote it.) This is a story about a ""monster,"" no, a story of a living thing, innately good, who is MADE into a monster by his creator and the society in general. I beg you not read the story as a horror story, but as a truth about human-kind."
3,"""Frankenstein""","This age old novel Frankenstein was simply superb. The story's plot united three exciting elements: horror, action, and romance. Mary Shelly did a spectacular job on this one. This novel kept the reading light on all night and into the early hours of the morning. I was pleased to find excitement on every page. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story, but has patience. I mean you must get through the beginning of the book to get to the interesting parts. Trust me it's worth it. Doctor Frankenstein actually created an artificial life form in a laboratory. We someday might be able to do this. The question this book made me think of is what would happen? Frankenstein created a thing that was supposed to be so good, but turned out to be so bad. This book was a real thriller."
3,Good story yet a little hard to follow,"as i was reading this book, i noticed that in some places the words just never seemed to end. The story line was very interesting. i read this book because i had seen the movie and my teacher said it was gothic. the way some things were described really blew me away in a sense that i would have never thought of things like that before. really good book, yet the ending was kind of a drop off."
1,Reader beware your in for the dull trip of your life!,This is one book that you shouldn't even spend the light of day to even read. The reason towards this is because it was dull boring and put me to sleep. I had to read this for school and didn't think the beginng was so bad but then I hit the bad spot it was the worse thing I ever read. It has its good points but few of them. Just don't waste your time on this.
1,This book will put you to sleep!,"I saw this book on here so I decided to get it. BIG MISTAKE! After reading the first 5 chapters I couldn't go on. The story, well how do I put this is...BORING! There are too many words which people wouldn't use in their everyday language, which was hard for me to understand. Also the plot was very slow and tiresome. I do not recommend this book to anyone. But if you haven't slept for a while this is a book that will put you to sleep after the first chapter."
1,Scary how bad it is...,"I knew little of the story when I picked up this book. In fact, I was one of those people who thought the monster's name was Frankenstein. Whoops... Anyways, I found that the narrative structure of the book to be distracting, the stereotypical characters annoying, and the monster actually coming alive (taking place in less than a paragraph) to be a let down."
4,Pretty good,"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, written in 1818 is amazing in part because it is still so readable and enjoyable. Based on my vast experience with bad horror interpretations of monsters, I expected this book to be dull with a main character who was both slow and stupid. Not so. Shelly creates a monster who possesses a reasonable IQ and incredible physical abilities. This book has a good plot, dialogue and fast-paced story. It is easy to read, understand and has an unanticipated ending. Highly recommend for middle school and above."
5,A discovery about the monster,"Frankenstein's monster was hiding in the wods next to a cabin occupied by a couple. On hearing them converse, the monster desired the ability to speak and read. By listening to them , he figured out how language woked. He then looked for literature and found and read ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"". Didn't see that in any of the movies. Who knew that Frankenstein's monster was a German Romantic? Now Victor Frankenstein himself, maybe so."
