5,NN-H964BF,"We had this unit for 8 years. It did quit on us once, but all it needed was a fuse replacement. It was great. Worked as promise."
2,Family Values lacking,"Our 2 year old likes watching this DVD, but we don't like what he is learning. The main theme of the Longneck Migration episode is the accidental finding of Littlefoot's father. However, no mention or question about the little dinosaur's mother is ever made. In fact, there appear to be no mothers for ANY of the dinosaur children.In the 2nd humorless tale, its lesson on lying is lost in all the family and group fighting. The subplots of disrespect for Cera's father (who is wooing a female dinosaur in the story, creating friction between Cera and her father) and weak parenting all around make this story a two thumbs down."
4,Good Coffee Brewer,"This coffee brewer was purchased for the regular use of a church group. It brews coffee reasonably fast, and if you follow the measurements listed on the front of it, the coffee brewed is quite good. The coffee urn is attractive and lite-weight making it easy to handle and clean."
5,Love it for what I bought it for,I bought this specifically to make mulled cider for the holidays and absolutely love it. It's the perfect size - makes about 1.5 gallons.
2,It began leaking right away,"This is a nice looking coffee urn, but it began leaking soon after we started using it. We have had it less than three months and already it leaks so bad it is useless. I'll admit that there are a lot of chemicals in our water, but we have an old one we have used for years and it still doesn't leak. I'm not a happy camper."
4,Good upper-level undergraduate treatment of the subject,"I found out that this book is intended for graduate students only at the end of the course, which was based on this text. It was though a good experience to have studied from it as it provides a thorough and fundamental treatment of Digital Communications topics. The chapters on sampling, multiplexing and optimum filters were the most enjoyable for me. I did not really see the point in such a short text on Fourier analysis - the Oppenheim's ""Signals and Systems"" provides a much more systematic description of the Fourier Series and FT. Four stars because of that, but if you already know FT very well then buy this book since it's a good deal and a worthy investment!"
3,Replacing one after only two years,"My first T101r was working fine, then the connection between the time-wheel and the gear behind it broke. I super-glued it numerous times but eventually it still kept failing. I tried to contact Intermatic twice through e-mail, but never got a reply. So instead, I bought a replacement timer here on Amazon and just switched out the motor and clock. I kept the box the same. Rewiring it was extremely easy and took less than 5 minutes. If you need to replace yours, it is extremely easy to do. Hopefully mine will last much longer this time. On the positive note, it is very easy to set the trippers and time and the water-tight case does a great job of protecting the inside."
3,"Problem with ""on"" clip","The first unit I bought the ""on"" clip wouldn't turn the power on. The off clip functioned fine.Sent first unit back to Amazon as defective with no return problem.Received the replacement unit and had the same problem.Decided to try and fix the problem myself.The ""on"" clip needed to be about a 1/8 of an inch lower to push the lever on. So I modified the ""on"" clip and it now works fine.Manufacturer should check their tolerances."
4,Dependable,I've used these types of electromechanical timers for years. This purchase is to replace an almost like and kind timer my Pop bought used 40 years ago that finally stopped working. After an easy and simple installation the timer is working flawlessly.
5,:),these pants are very comfy! i didnt know what to expect from buying jeans without trying them on but i made the right choice! they were cheap and exactly what i needed!the only thing wrong with wranglers is that they ride too low in the back area as to where you need to hike them up so they are riding in your crack lol
1,Side Pocket on Leg is too small,"Before wearing Wrangler Pants, The only jeans I would wear were Levi's 501 button fly. But wearing the Wrangler Carpenter Jeans gave me the option of keeping my cell phone in the side leg pocket. The last time I went to the store, they only had one pair left; and it was darker than I preferred, but I needed some more pants, so I got it. I thought to look online and was happy to find Amazon had them; and in the right lighter shade of blue. I tried them on this morning for the first time. At first everything was cool. The comfortable; even though slightly new. But when I was ready to leave for work, I couldn't get my phone in the pocket. WoW! I couldn't believe these pants' pocket was too narrow. I will never buy these pants; before physically trying them on first, again! Even though it's annoying to have to use the local store's dressing room, something I don't like doing; I really wish I had that opportunity this time.Buyers BEWARE !!!"
4,Jeans,"I like these jeans because they are light weight and easy to move around in. They do tear easy, especially if you get the hammer loop caught on something. I ruined a few pairs that way. They have a pocket on the side that works great for putting your phone in."
1,poor sizing,"These jeans are not sized properly. According to the way these fit , I would need a size three times larger than my regular size."
3,Disappointed by the fit,"I have worn out my old Wrangler Carpenter jeans, and wanted to replace them. They were a little tight, but okay - I went one size up with these new ones, but can barely get them on!I'm giving three stars because the ones I had were very comfortable and wore well. However, the sizing doesn't seem to be consistent. I guess I should go to a brick & mortar store for pants so I can try them on before buying."
3,They're ok...,"These jeans are better than the Wrangler Carpenter jeans sold at Walmart, but they sure don't fit as well. Disappointing!"
2,Wrangler carpenter jeans,Delivered in timely manner but the fit was too tight on my thighs and i couldn't get my hands in the tight and shallow pockets.
5,Blackberry eater,"When used with my high-wheeled weed trimmer, this line eats through blackberry bushes like a hungry herd of goats. Nothing stops it. 315ft of it is going to last me a very, very long time..."
1,"Does not fit many .155"" heads","I tried this .155"" line on a Kwik HD trimmer head. The lines kept on flying off the head after less than a minute's use. When I looked for another HD trimmer head on-line, I discovered I couldn't find one that would accept .155"" line, unless it was round in cross section. This stuff by Cyclone is hexagonal making it useless for me. I've returned the line. Buyers should be aware of the difficulty of finding a head that will work with this hexagonal line."
3,"Not as good as what came with the trimmer, but adequate","Using this now that I'm out of the original line that came with the machine (Poulan). Works well in lighter grass and weeds, but not in the thick, moist bunch grass that grows along the fence line. The line whine requires ear protection, and it gets ""bent"" in the trimmer's spin direction. The original line stayed straight, increasing the cutting action significantly. I'll be looking for something else when this spool is low."
4,Line for push behind weed trimmers,"Seems to do the job ok, don't have much to compare it to. Was sent promptly and arrived in new condition."
5,Amazing Bars,These are the most delicious bars!!! I have only tasted the Banana Bread one so I can't speak to the others. They are so good and filling! They make for a quick snack/meal on the go.
3,"great quality and ingredients, but...","even though the quality of this food and the ingedients seem to be excellent, i did not enjoy the overall appearance and taste.I'm not saying is bad for everyone, but i did not like it."
5,Works Great!,Bought this to try a mirror style lens and it hooked up great without any problems. Looking for to trying it on a spotting scope in the future! Great value!
4,Decent quality,"Good and sturdy quality. Solid aluminum. It has a perfectly flush and tight fit on my camera, with no annoying slack what so ever. The adapter is however a ""blind/dummy"" adapter; it has no AF/AI forwarding screw and no F-stop forwarding connector, contrary to what appears to be indicated by the item description."
5,T T2 LENS ADAPTER FOR NIKON CAMERAS.,I received the item as stated it was packed well and it dose everything I wanted it to do.I would recommend this item to every Nikon Owner.
1,This Mount is NOT for Nikon!,This mount does not fit my Nikon D3100! I bought this to convert some t-mount lenses a family memeBer gave me! Well I know not to trust this brand anymore!
3,"Parlsey, sage, rosemary and thyme","Imagine Simon and Garfunkel's 'Scarborough Fair' repeated seven or eight times and interspersed with 'psychedelic' drones. That's basically what you have here. It certainly has a kind of beauty, but it's hard to get over the Simon and Garfunkel thing. I wouldn't admit to a fondness for aspects of this music in the company of my more tasteful friends."
3,Good...But........,"Bit of a comedown vs. ""Trilogy"" and ""Orange."" Seems like Bob and the boys got a bit too carried away with optical effects. Way over-produced! These ""cheesy"" rock-video gimmicks in combination with too much crowd noise really took away from the music. The music incidentally is just fine. Nothing great though. So..worth getting? Well, your life would be complete without this DVD. If you can get a good deal on one get it - especially if you're a real fan. Wouldn't pay list for it though.BTW, you can find DVDs of ""Orange"" if you Google it and look carefully. Some Internet ""entrepreneurs"" sell it for $10 or $20. And worth every penny. Quality of them - at least the one I got - was superb - as is the music and production."
3,Robert's POV,"The concert experience from Robert Smith's point of view. Great audio, so-so video. Too many camera shots of Robert's face and torso. Would prefer to see the actual playing of the instruments and more of the crowd's perspective. You really cannot appreciate the lighting effects from this perspective. Additionally, this concert is performed without keyboards, which sonically, leaves the songs less impressive."
2,was ok,This was okay. I mainly only liked several of the songs live. But I am a die hard Cure fan so it was a must for my collection.
2,Not Impressed,"I really like The Cure, saw them in concert many times since the early 80's, I even have other DVD's by them, but the quality on this one is not impressive. I really wish I didn't spend the money. I don't like how they shot the concert, it looks like a novice did it. The sound quality is ok, but not compariable to their other concert DVD's. I would pass on this one and buy Trilogy, that one is Awesome!!"
5,Another show I missed.......again,"I would actually rate this about a 4.5 due to the video quality. Some of the camera shots are not great and the skipping around can be a little annoying sometimes. Some of the cameras are operated by people in the audience and you can tell which ones pretty easy. It is a nice idea that just did not cut it......Overall the music is great and with Porl rejoining his mates, it makes it a kind of homecomming. No complaints at all on the main part of the show.The music is awesome and Smith sounds as good as ever. I loved the whole set. This is not as good as Trilogy, but ranks up there with Live in Orange."
5,Totally satisfied.,"I've had this installed in a 12' X 20' greenhouse for about a month now. It keeps the greenhouse at a ""pleasant"" 50 degrees even when night time temps drop into the 30's. It's relatively quiet. I'm sure it's going to bump up my electric bill during the winter months but being an avid succulent plant collector, I think I can live with that. Plus, it's made right here in the U.S."
5,Outstanding heater.,Well made heater. Provides heat instantly with a quality internal fan to direct the warmth. Easy access to reduce the number of heating coils required to stay within your power source's current (amps). Made in the U S A.
5,Love it,"So easy to prepare, higher fiber without the too-rough texture, kids love it, too and don't complain that it's whole wheat"
5,Great price for a household staple.,"Whole wheat couscous is a food staple in our house, and purchasing it in the local stores is either very expensive (single boxes) or not great for storage (bulk purchase from natural foods store). The four containers make storage a breeze and the price per ounce is a great savings."
1,Beware the Package Size is Indeed 26.5 oz not 31.7 oz,"We have been buying this from Whole Foods, and love it, but decided to price it at Amazon. The heading says the containers are 26.5 but under product features is say 31.7 oz. So at the web page I asked others who purchased it for the size they received. The 4 who answered said 31.7 oz. So I ordered the 4 pack and to my dismay they were indeed only 26.5. I guess the manufacturers shrank the container size (happening with many consumer items) but neglected to revise the details under Product Features. This rating is obviously not for the product itself but for web site misinformation which still has not been corrected."
5,Healthy!,Our family loves couscous so I decided to give the w/w version a try. I used chicken stock for the liquid and it is so good and so fast.
5,It's about time,"Finally someone takes the initiative to tell the story of a company that's corporate, but not really corporate. Not Microsoft or Enron or Nike or any of the Big Money companies but instead a down to earth story about a tiny little 100 million dollar company that has a story that's actually interesting. And if the story itself got boring (it never did) I could still just look at all the great photos. This is an important book for a number of reasons. It documents an era when sports in America are changing. It documents a company that stayed true to those sports. It is inspiring in a way that will show kids to follow their heart, and success will follow. Finally, it isn't a big marketing scam hidden under false pretenses. What you see with AGENTS OF CHANGE is what you get, and what you get is a great book for a book shelf or coffee table; skate park or corporate meeting room of any company who targets the youth demographic."
3,Passionate self-help manual on actualizing yourself at work,"Lawler Kang is here to help if you're feeling unhappy or unfulfilled in your career. His ""Five Ps"" self-examination process arises from his philosophy that, since ""you don't get nine lives"" like the fabled feline, you must live each moment to the fullest. Life is too short to stay in a boring job. You've probably heard these ideas before, but Kang's exercises and checklists may help you to act on them. His style is sincere, but overeager and jargon-ridden, and the peculiar, hard-to-read typeface exacerbates his confusing tendency to trip on his own clichés. We suggest that people who are feeling inextricably stuck in unsatisfying careers will find it worthwhile to transcend these drawbacks. Kang may be able to start you on a journey to fulfillment and happiness."
5,Great guide to having the time of your life in your lifetime!,"Passion at Work combines Lawler's inspirational story, wonderful humor and some real life tools to help readers follow their passion. How many times have you said..""someday I'll...."" and never followed through? Get your hands on Passion at Work, the best guide available for following your dream/passion. Lawler provides a clear and easy to follow process that combines both the idenfication of passions, followed by prioritizations and the creation of a life plan. Invest in your dreams and yourself: read the book, do the work, if you need a wee bit of support-hire a coach from lawlerkang.com (even Lance Armstrong has a coach). May you have the time of your life in your lifetime!"
3,Almost Like the Real Thing,"My love affair with miso, the flavorful paste made from fermented soybeans, started when I lived in Tokyo several years ago. So, since then, being the miso snob that I am, it has been unimaginable to me to try any instant variety. But I have to say that when I finally did break down and try Kikkoman Instant Tofu Miso Soup, I was amazed to find that it was practically indistinguishable in flavor and consistency from miso soup made from the actual paste. While I would still choose the actual product whenever time permits, I would now not hesitate to substitute this great product when I am on the run."
3,Tasty but the serving is small,Serving size is a bit small. Fits in a 6 ounce tea cup.It is really good though. Tastes like regular miso except much less spicy.
4,"easy to make, a bit salty","This is good for a powdered product. I prefer the separate soybean paste with a packet of dried seaweed & tofu, but this has a good flavor. A bit salty for my taste."
2,bad price on inferior product,these undersized and overpriced packets of miso soup has additives like 'dry fish powder' and i did not notice the small print of ingredients before buying and accepting shipment. i have other products ordered through amazon that are great and repeatedly shipped to my door but this product is inferior and i wish i could get a refund on unused and still sealed portion.
3,"Tasty, but. . .","This was quite tasty, but the saltiness was overwhelming. If you have to limit your salt intake, steer clear of this item."
1,Beware = Contains MSG!,"Recently, I have been trying to upgrade my eating habits and reduce any processed food and additives from my diet. That said, I have been very careful to read labels and small print. With Miso soupls in particular, I have noticed that unless the packaging does not say 'No MSG"" in big bold letters on the front of the package, the soup contains MSG. This brand is no exception. I like the taste and was enjoying it for quite a few years until I have made this discovery. No MSG Miso soups exist but are harder to find. I usually go to specialized Asian markets to get them. This brand is the most commercially available Miso soup on the market. It's a shame that it is not the healthiest choice for those who care about what they eat."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I trusted the other good reviews, but this tastes awful and has a bad aftertaste. Yuk."
2,Too General,This book was too general and didn't give enough information about the subject. I regret wasting my money on it.
5,From one Rabbi to another,"I'm a Rabbi now for 32 years, and I must say that Rabbi Abraham, who speaks about Kabbalah in this book, was an astute, no-nonsense teacher with a biting sense of humor. He takes Kabbalah out the realm of hodge-podge fantasy, and puts it squarely into the category of Jewish esoteric philosophy. There are hints of Maimonides, Spinoza, Mendelsohn and Hermann Cohen in the Rabbi's teachings. I can also see the influences of Gershom Scholem, Aryeh Kaplan and Moshe Idel. Rabbi Abraham had a rare talent to articulate the major tenets of these prolific philosophers and scholars, and combine them into a basic instruction manuel on how to live a good life based in rightousness. There's an important message in this book for everyone, and I admire the Rabbi's chutzpah as he tells his new student exactly what's on his mind."
5,I'm a Rabbi who appreciates this book.,"This is one of the few books I have read about Kabbalah that explains the basic concepts in an intelligent and truthful manner. I use this book as one of my standard teaching tools in all my classes in Brooklyn and New York City. There are many students who attend my classes who have been misled by certain Kabbalah organizations and this book helps to set them straight. Some of these Kabbalah organizations have a a 'cult-like' following and their members purposely slander excellent Kabbalah books like this one. Not only does this book explain the wisdom of Kabbalah, but there are also beautiful illustrations from The Kabbalah Art Museum in Zefat, Israel. Rabbi Abraham was a brilliant teacher of Kabbalah and this book is a tribute to his intellect, compassion and deep understanding of this subject."
5,A skeptic's review of an oustanding book.,"I've always been a skeptic and I don't believe in mystical religion. My wife hounded me for 2 months to read this book and I wanted no part of it. I told her it was a waste of my time. Well, I've eaten alot of crow because I couldn't even fake not liking this book. In fact, I have to admit that I genuinely and thoroughly enjoyed the Rabbi's insights and logical statements.I just bought copies for my three kids who go to Kabbalah classes in California. They just cannot believe I actually like a book about Kabbalah. Now, we talk on the phone about Golems, Tzaddiks, Adam Kadmon and Sephirot. So, besides the fact that this book is intelligent and sensible, I now have much more interesting conversations with my wife and kids. I am actually glad that my wife kept pestering me to read it."
3,Sort-of weird... sort-of interesting....,"I thought this book was going to be a love story... it's not! I guess that kind of disappointed me. The first half is about Dirk growing up, some of it's really sad, it made me cry. The second half of the book, where ""ghosts of Dirk's ancestors, including the mother and father he never knew, share tales of his past, present, and future through magical images, setting him free to know that true love in any form is right"" is really confusing. The characters have a lot of hallucinations which I found to be really weird, and the simple message is kind-of hard to grasp through the writing. The 12 and up age recommendation for the book is crazy, I would say at least ages 15 and up. The writing is filled with flowery descriptions, but at the same time I feel like she could have showed more instead of telling the story. And I feel like the story isn't finished."
5,I Can't Get Enough of this game,"I'm a fifteen year old young man, and most of the time, I get bored with video games. But this game I never got bored with. I just was dumb, and I sold this game once, then bought it again. Then I sold it again, and I haven't been able to find it, thank goodness for Amazon.com. You think I would've learned my lesson, but I just can't wait untill my copy arrives. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did/do."
4,Brilliant,"""breakfast with Scot"" is an outrageously funny feature. While his gay (but very discreet) parents try to live the average life, Scot is as flamboyant and outspoken as he can be. From his dress and mannerisms, to his declarations that ""my parents are gay"", Scot challenges the world to stand up and take notice of him. The film is humorious, while also trying to get a message across. I highly recommend it."
3,Breakfast with Scot,"A little disappointing in its execution, arrived in good condition. Odd his own foster parent seemed homophobic and not very kind to the kid."
3,Good job by child actor,Nice film. The adult actors contributed little to the story. The one who played the jock looked like he was acting in every scene - his performance was not smooth or believable. The story is worthwhile and sincere. No silliness. It helps one to understand some aspects of what being gay entails.
4,Ghost Towns: An off beat mystery,"General Outline:Chloe is a victim witness who gets caught up in the dark secrets that lie beneath the surface in small towns. A local judge is murdered and the rumors flying around suggest that his life wasn't as nice as it looked and that the judge was trying to ""start his life over"". Also Chloe's reporter friend has found out somthing about the judge that he does not want to tell her. As Chloe becomes involved in the investigation in her role as a victim witness she finds out that the judges family is hiding a dark past...----This was a pretty good mystery read, its not from a main stream author so it does read a little differntly than somthing you would find on the top ten best sellers list at your local book store. The story kept me guessing until the end and when it did end it wasn't what I was suspecting. If your looking for a ""differnt"" mystery writer give this author a try and you proably won't be disappointed.m.a.c"
5,better than dish rags,"I use this product daily in an institutional setting. It holds up very well, absorbs like a sponge, and rinses clean. Great product!"
1,Very nozy,I try to use it with iPod 60 connected to AUX in Toyota Prius. Noise appears immediately after connecting Powerjolt.The noise level make it uncomfortable to listen.
2,Not what is shown...,"They sent a gray shirt with black ringers, not a white one. I never received an email or call asking if a substitution was ok. So, if you have your heart set on white, don't order - they are NOT available, even though that is what is pictured here. Shipping is slow and customer service leaves a lot to be desired..."
5,Perfect,Got delivery earlier than estimated date.It blends perfectly with my new Silver Panasonic LCD tv along with my old 'Black' vcr.Easy to assemble and occupies less space than other new models.Perfect for a corner !
4,Are you sure the door is locked?,"This story had me pretty creeped out. Is it possible to feel so frightened and yet not feel you are totally ""getting it""? This story takes place in Ireland, but not the Ireland of any tourist brochures, heh-heh...The main character is a young woman who is suffering from Lupus. Her mother is perpetually depressed, her aunt is rather odd. Strange events are occuring in the village. Sheep are disappearing, the mountains are oddly quiet. The book left me feeling so uneasy yet I felt I didn't totally understand what was happening, which is a pretty disconcerting feeling to someone who loves to read. Yet, maybe that was the author's intention, to leave the reader frightened, unsure and questioning....I am going to re-read this book, I feel I must..."
4,Great for vacuum brush rolls,I use this to cut long hairs from my vacuum cleaner's brush roll. It works pretty good. Much better than scissors or a razor blade.
4,It rips seams!,A simple tool for simple job. Has fallen apart. sometimes the tips of these things break off but it hasn't happened yet. Very affordable. I say go for it.
4,Seam ripper,Seams to bo of quality manufacture and well designed.I would recomend it to others who are looking for something of this type.
4,No different.,The seam Ripper is not different or better than others I have used. But I would recommend this one for the handle.
3,A good start,"If you're looking into buying this record, you should know that it's an EP - there are only six songs, just over 20 minutes of music. The CD starts with a pop-rock bang à la Sloan, ""Don't Walk Away Eileen,"" which might surprise if all you've heard is the second track and current single, ""Brother Down."" Unfortunately, after two great songs, the CD starts to disappoint. While well-written, the next four tracks are bogged down in monotonous over-production, but if you can get past this, you should enjoy the Inhuman Condition EP - it's a good introduction to Sam Roberts' burgeoning talent."
4,dd 500 works well,"After a short learning curve, I have returned many of my twist drills to like new or better than new condition, saving the use of my brad point drills some and keeping my twist drills from dancing."
4,Easy Buy,"Mr. Blevins' Hard Sell is a fast paced story about a classic detective, Sam Miller, who simply wants to enjoy his Rhode Island vacation. Two bodies dumped on his front porch spoil that, but just makes for an exciting read. Taking us all over the small state of Rhode Island, Hard Sell could double as a travel brochure.All in all, a great read, that you simply can't put down."
5,A great set!,"I got this toy when I was 6 years old and now I am 10 and it is still in great condition. The trucks are a little big for the plane, but I don't mind. I play with this set by building an airport on my kitchen floor, using the cones, signs, and trucks in the set. I play with these planes so much, my mom lets me keep the airport up for 3 weeks or more. I have 16 different kinds of airplane sets. All the sets are real fun to play with, and I love them!"
2,Poor materials,I bought for my nephew and the product was poor quality and wing broke off right away. I do not recommend this product for a child who is going to actually play with the plane
3,"Not good, not bad","The planes are a bit smaller than we thought, so the price now seems a little high for what it is. Other than that it is exactly as advertised."
3,Passable Current History,"This concludes Craig's two-part European History, which started with Europe: 1815-1914.The trouble with writing a history of the 20th Century is that we're really too close to it. Although Craig makes a fine effort, the fact that the work was done before the end of the Cold War makes the last part of it seem a bit out of touch with the real issues -- the fate of Communism being now a decided matter.But for solid accounts of the two World Wars and the events leading up to them, this is still an excellent introduction, and the more knowledgable reader should still find a few new bits of information or different ways to view the era.Anyway, anyone who read the first volume probably wants to read this one -- just for completeness -- and, as in that volume, Craig's writing is easy to follow and always interesting."
4,A must read book,This book by Charles F. Hamblen is a fast paced book that is hard to put down. It weaves the past(greek mythology) and present day problems. A group called the dawn timers try to resolve current day problems to make the world a better place for all to live in. I highly reccomend this book to anyone.
1,Junk,"We have been attempting to use this heater (converted to propane) for about 8 months. It will not stay on, you cannot turn it to high or it turns itself off, nor will the pilot light stay lit. Also, it is very hard to push the igniter switch. It's a good way to break nails and hurt fingers. I am very angry, as it is our only source of heat for the bedroom and shower area. It does not heat well. It was very expensive for what it is and we are pulling it out and replacing it with something that will heat the area (about 375 sq. ft.)."
4,Clever and fun space opera,"There's nothing typical about this space opera, with overtones of hard science. The more you read the more the clever story unfolds until you're in a very different place from where you started. Really nice work by Mr. Cook in this second story of his I've read since the equally-intriguingThe Engines of Dawn. I'm taking one star off for the recurring and very annoying typos, mainly proper end-of-line hyphens turned into improper middle-of-a-line hyphens in the process of formatting the book text to html. There's really no excuse for such lazy proofreading (or, more likely, no proofreading) by a publisher."
2,Scattered story,"Story premise is interesting, prisoners held captive, unable to remember their crimes but needed by their jailers for their products. Unfortunately, the story jumps around different storylines, trying to build suspense. Also disconcerting was a few pages devoted to juvenile ramblings about sex. Totally unwarranted and didn't add to the story. As a woman who enjoys science fiction/fantasy, I didn't find those tidbits necessary."
1,Kirby's 'Erin Brockovich' Moment has come and gone,I met David Kirby at a non-autism related event a year before 'Evidence of Harm' was published. As the father of an autistic child I was astounded by his lack of basic knowledge of the spectrum. When pressed he finally acknowledged that this was his 'Erin Brockovich' moment: i.e. his story of heroic moms standing up against 'big pharma' would prove as irresistible to Hollywood as had Erin Brockovich's whistle-blowing story. Only problem was Kirby's claims re vaccines have been discredited time and time and time again by study after scientific study. This book will one day be viewed as representing as sorry a chapter in the history of autism as the darkest days of Bruno Bettelheim's reign of terror. This is also a disgraceful chapter in the history of American journalism.
5,"A close-up, impartial look at mercury in vaccines","Since mercury is still present Nov 2008) in some vaccines, this book is essential reading for anyone who uses vaccines for themselves or their children. With an objective eye, reporter David Kirby presents both sides of the mercury-in-vaccine controversy so you can understand each side and see their motivations, experiences and reasoning before making up your own mind. The book is a skillfully told tale of mysteries and secrets, cross-purposes and showdowns. It is a story of passion, determination and struggle on both sides of the fence. It's an interesting, enlightening, and amazing read."
5,This book delivers!,"In evidence of harm we can see proof of the continued horror that vaccination brings. This is not new, this has been the case since the first vaccinations started.If you want to read the rest of the facts, read:The Poisoned Needle: Suppressed Facts about Vaccination"
1,misinformation,This book is written by a shill for parents hoping for a big payout. The author doesn't understand science and is hurting the public by writing misinformation.
5,Awesone like a mystery novel,I bought this because i have a child with autism and i felt like i wanted more answers.I got some of them answered with this book!It is excellently written and David Kirby really delves in.IT also traces the stories of parents who are fighting for what they know happened to their children and all the corruption out there.A must read.I do have to say though i almost got angry reading it.The truth in this matter is shocking if you open your eyes! Job well don David Kirby keep up the good fight!!
5,Mother of THREE autistic children,"I have three autistic children. I can't pick the book up. And I can't put the book down. Even I, with my 3 kids, can't say without a doubt that Thimerosal is the cause of my kids's autism. But David Kirby's book peels away the layers of deception so artfully it is difficult not to question WHY the government allowed organic mercury into ANY American, let alone our tiniest citizens.The vaccine issue will make the cigarette lawsuits look like a day at the beach. And while we can BLAME smokers for harming themselves how do we blame parents for following doctors orders?Why was Thimerosal removed from my contact lense solution years ago (and advertised on every bottle as ""Thimerosal Free!"") and yet pediatricians TO THIS VERY MOMENT continue to inject it into babies and children?I think the horses have left the barn and they ain't going back. THANK YOU DAVID KIRBY."
3,"Excellently written, very balanced and logical","This is the first book authored by David Kirby that I have read. For writing on such a Controversial subject one needs to have a lot of guts. He has it. Must read for everybody. [...]While most of the media blindly write what it hears from scientists sponsored by Pharmaceutical Companies, there are a few exceptions and whistle blowers like David Kirby. This book brings out many facts about strong links between Mercury laced Vaccines and Autism rise. It also raises lot of serious questions about credibility of FDA, CDC, IOM and other agencies who are supposed to protect American people are actually controlled by Pharmaceutical Companies because of direct financial links. A great book, every parent, doctor, healthcare professional, student should read this wonderful book."
2,Mercury poisoning is not autism,"Is this book a good read? Yes. Is it accurate? No.There is a whole industry growing around the burgeoning 'quack cure' industry and their latest target is parents of autistics.Study after study after study from country after country after country have demonstrated no link between mercury and autism. By linking the two David Kirby demonstrates his ignorance. Autism is a developmental disorder, mercury poisoning is mercury poisoning. By publicly linking the two when there is no actual link Kirby is responsible for allowing scare-mongering groups to make money off the backs of parents via very dubous 'therapies'. I wrote a long essay about the subject here: http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php?p=174Parents: please read this book but don't assume that one side of the story tells all. Read the science s well as the conspiracy theories."
1,Pseudoscientific Yellow Journalism,"I'm a scientist and a father of an autistic child so I know a lot more about the science behind this issue than Mr Kirby and I can confidently say that he is failing in his responsibility to the public to get the facts straight. Years ago, Mr Kirby became convinced that mercury was the problem (probably because it made a great news story)and publicly said that autism would decrease if thimerosal was removed from vaccines. Of course, that prediction did not come true but rather than admit his mistake and hurt his career as a journalist he is stubbornly persisting in trying to convince everyone he was right. Do NOT waste your time with this biased unscientific book unless you want to understand the point of view of the hysterical anti-vaccine movement. This book preys on the fears of parents with autistic children and is helping to enrich the lawyers who sue pharmaceutical companies and governments."
1,Thimerosol Does Not Cause Autism,"Thimerosol has not been in childhood vaccines for many years, and the autism rate continues to increase. Also, the form of mercury in thimerosol is not neurotoxic. Case closed."
5,Just Read the Book,"This book is undoubtedly the best I have read regarding the linkbetween vaccines and autism, and I've read many, many books and articles on this subject.The book is not based on the author's opinion, but on scientific biological studies and proven facts which support the vaccine-autism connection.I highly commend David Kirby for his committment and courage in writing this book and I recommend it to every parent and grandparent in the country."
5,...finally...,The parents of children with autism have watched our kids fall into the abyss. Thank you David Kirby for bringing this into the public eye. I wish every new mother would read your book. You are an American hero.
2,Evidence of Harm,"While the author does possess that oh so important journalistic flair (which is why I haven't given this book a single-star), he lacks any sort of proper scientific perspective. The issue has been all but settled amongst medical circles while only a small percent of fringe doctors view mercury in vaccines as the cause of any sort of autism. That's all I've got to say on this text of pseudo-scientific yellow journalism."
5,The truth,This chilling account of how vaccines have harmed us and how the FDA and the CDC have not protected us is a must-read.
1,a frightening book,"I'm a skeptic about the relationship between vaccinations and autism, even though as the father of a child with autism, I desperately want to know the cause. But this book really got me thinking that there might be a relationship. Only a few days after reading the book, I caught myself. I realized that Kirby is a mouthpiece for a small group of parent advocates, namely those at SafeMinds, and that the book ignores science in service of creating fear. Why are the rank and file scientists not working on the thimerasol issue? Of 344 papers given at the IMFAR meetings this week, only 2 dealt with vaccinations. Are all scientists involved in the ""conspiracy?"" I hope this book will be forgotten soon and that we spend our time and effort looking at the science, not journalistic hype."
3,It served its purpose,I wasn't crazy about the pen & labels but the organizer itself is quite durable and effective.
5,Roar!,I love reading this to my son! And he loves looking at the colorful pictures of all the animals in it!
5,Another charming artful story,These books are lovely and any parent will enjoy the artistry of this author. The story is simple and very acceptable to my 5 year old grandchild.
2,Bias comes through.,"The authors both are long-time consultants for Visa and it is very apparent in this book. The discussion of MasterCard, Discover, and American Express is limited. The treatment of various legal actions (Nabanco, US DOJ, WalMart, duality) is one sided. There is minimal study of the economics of the business from vantage points (consumer, merchant, acquirer, Issuer, co-branding partner, etc.) other than the card association.It's clear from some of the statistical material prsented that Visa particpated in the book.Ever see JAG? It's about a real portrayl of the Navy & Marine Corp as this is of the card industry."
3,Paying with Plastic,"Vey basic but covers all the aspect of the credit card world. Also, gives some details about the industry mayor events and the recent developings after the Antitrust litigations against Visa and MasterCard."
1,Fell off three times today,"At the ER, they put a great gauze on my wound. I bought this J&J product at a local drug store, and it doesn't stay put. Fell down, dropped and stretched out three times today. Made in China. Low quality."
5,excellent book,"simple to read, very detailed, and to the point. i wished this professor taught at my school:)"
2,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"This book is a good tool for learning HTML however if you are wanting to learn JavaScript also - it is pitched at ""experienced programmers"" - as it states - and not so good if your just starting out."
2,2 Star Review,"This book is covers the very basics about JavaScript, PHP, XML, XSL etc..The explaination is also not too helpful. This book is for someone who just wants to view introductory information about web languages. I bought this book only because it was the text book for my online class."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK,This has to be the worst IT book I have ever had to buy. Everyone in class hated it. It was all over the place and did not really teach. I do not recommend this book and I hope schools don't force students to buy this junk
4,Just Plain Entertaining,"""Pippin"" has a fantastic score because of the consistantly catchy tunes. The show is from the seventies that may not appeal to everyone, but songs like ""Corner of the Sky,"" ""The Right Track"" and ""Simple Joys"" just stick in your head. Though John Rubinstein does not have a great voice, he is suitable as the innocent Pippin and Ben Vareen great as the Leading Player. If you catch his performance on the video of the national tour, you will see why this show made him a star."
5,Love it,"I saw this at the Kennedy Center and loved it. My 7 y.o. LVES Wicked... Plays the CD non-stop, so I dug out my old vinyl version of Pippin and played it for her. Magic To Do blew her away. It's ageless."
4,Missing the Irene Ryan Single,"Decca missed the boat by not including Irene Ryan's Motown pop single of ""No Time at All"" as a bonus track. It is different from the album version."
5,Crazy Rock Star Extraveganza,"I bought this CD because I am playing the guitar player who comes out and rocks down Simple Joys in my high school production. For anyone who may not be too fond of musicals, but loves fun driven music, this is more than a happy medium. Playing this music is the one time I have felt like a rock star in a theatre production."
2,Music can't stand alone...,"As a huge musical theatre fan, I bought this CD hoping the music would be as good as the plot. I was sadly disappointed. Pippin might be a wonderful musical with the appropriate staging, choreography, costumes, etc...but as a CD, the songs aren't strong enough to stand alone. Someone unfamiliar with the plot would never be able to figure it out going only by the music (or the extremely worthless liner notes). I suppose one could say that Fosse's work should be seen and not heard..."
4,"Wonderful Then, Wonderful Now","I have loved this musical with this cast for years, but only had it on LP!! Does anyone still remember what that means??"
1,"I love Pippin, but this is unlistenable","I'll be brief. Notwithstanding Irene Ryan's emotive performance, I find the vocals nearly unlistenable in terms of vocal quality. I've seen Pippin five times and have loved every minute. This disk is a total letdown. The singing quality is worse than any junior highschool act I've heard. I don't care if Pippin is the best musical ever written; this disk is just so bad!"
2,not very appropriate for young kids,"The music is okay,but I wasn't moved. I took my seven year old to the play which was put on by teenagers. It was laden with sexual references and dancing, ending with a finale promoting suicide, and just confusing and scary for young ones."
2,"I've Never Seen It Live, But","A disappointing by the numbers musical, poor lyrics, poorly sung. There are much better musicals out there. Maybe it sounds better when you see it, who knows?"
4,"Great Broadway, Great Music....","I went to a 2 week summer theatre camp, and one of the classes we did a dance to this and performed it for the rest of the camp and parents...I fell in love with the music from Pippin then! And if it were still on Broadway I would totally see it!Magic To Do is the best song on there, another great song is Extraordinary! :)Check it out! It's a great buy!"
3,The Kidstage version of Pippin is far better,This is Broadway? Uh huh. I went and saw Pippin put on by a bunch of teenagers at the Village Theater in Issaquah and they were better! When is *their* CD coming out?
5,Excellent Series for Travel,"This was my first language cassette, and I listened to it obsessively in the car during my commute for a month before traveling to Budapest. I was staying with friends, but there were a few instances where I had to fend for myself, and I managed to buy souvenirs and order drinks and dinner. I met my friend's Hungarian teacher and she seemed honestly surprised by how much I had been able to pick up.I have also used Fast & Easy German, with the same great results. If you have a mind for languages, you can even infer grammar from these and put together your own sentences! I'm going to see if they have one for Korean after I have finished writing this review... ;)"
5,"Introspective, moving, beautifully edited and honest","Unlike many people who have suffered great hardships in life, especially those that are more unique, Kimberly does not waste any time inviting the audience to her own pity-party. Her live documentation of her relationships and interactions with those around her is often touching, sometimes jarring, and definitely memorable.This is a perfect film for those who might seek a better understanding of the difficulties that trans people face, and those that people with traumatic brain injuries and mental illness battle. It does not overtly attempt to win a skeptical viewer over; rather, the film pointedly demonstrates how anyone can relate to overcoming a transition - whether it be a change in gender, or a change of heart.I saw this film live at the 2010 Out & Equal Workplace Summit and will be purchasing the DVD to share with my friends.Thank you Kimberly Reed!"
2,Dissappointed,I was also excited to read this book after seeing the Disney Movie. I wanted to use it for a book club book for my grand-daughters. It was such a fun movie and I liked the basic story. However I was dissapointed in the author. I did not appreciate the language she choice to use in the book. I know the argument is that they hear it at school and it is real life. That does not mean I want to give my girls a book and say hear is a good book when it has language I would NOT want them to use. By giving them the book I am saying it is okay to use bad language. So I will not be giving my 13 grand-daughters this book no matter how good the story line is.
1,how my private personal journal became a bestseller,"How my private personal journal became a best seller, has a very old plot. The author is very famous and writes very good books and I was looking forward to see a book that comes from an author of that stature. But it was a huge disappointment. There was nothing new in the book. It did not challenge my attention. I do not recommend this book."
2,How my Journal Became a Bestseller,"This book is about a girl who accidentally emails her teacher her diary instead if her assignment. The teacher thinks it's the greatest piece of writing and reads it to the class. Then she becomes a famous author, even appearing on TV, in a matter of weeks.I thought this book was atrocious. First of all, the plot is completely and 100% improbable. This would NEVER happen in real life. Normally I can suspend my belief when the story line is only semi probable, but not with this novel.I appreciate the fact that Julia wanted to relay a message of being yourself. The book does teach the reader not to worry about what people gossip about. The whole message was ruined for me when Jamie went and talked badly about the same girl she was writing about. It was so hypocritical.Overall I thought the story lacked any sort of depth. Skip this book, you'll be glad you did."
5,Awesome!,"This book is REALLY good!! I loved it! I read it in 5 days,(and I never read that fast!) that's how good it was. This girl (Jamie Bartlett) accedentally turns in her journal in instead of her English essay. Jamie's essay gets sent here and there until it gets published. ""How My Private Personal Journal Became a Bestseller"" has a good moral for girls. It's that being yourself is good, and popular people don't always get their way. And that clothes and style isn't everything."
4,The Business Coach (Instant Success) (Instant Success),"I haven't finished reading total book, but so far it is a very good book."
4,A great tool for Business Owners,"In this book Brad Sugars has created an entertaining and informative story that outlines a process he has used to help thousands of businesses around the world to be more successful. Everything is there to help business owners understand how they need to change their businesses if they want success. Just implementing the information on mastering the basics and the ""business chassis"" will put most businesses heads and shoulders over where they are now."
5,Business Success from Start to Finish,"I really liked this book because the format used a case study of Joe and Nellie's business to walk through the process of transforming their business into a commercial, profitable enterprise that works without them.I liked the way the process unfolded, using examples and teaching to help Joe and Nellie implement changes in their business. The important areas covered included the 6 Steps to Business Success, 5 Ways to Improve Profit, and the 6 Keys to a Winning Team. This enabled me to put theory into practice and see the results clearly illustrated at each step along the way.The other benefit I got was seeing how a business coach works to educate, motivate, and inspire entrepreneurs to fill in the gaps in their knowledge and make the changes they know they need to make to improve their business and lives."
5,The Business Coach,"Having read all of Brad's books and attended some of his seminars, I can say that this book should have been around 25 years ago when I started in business. Life would have been much easier then and even better now.Most business owners let their business run them and their lives, whereas they should be running it and reaping the benefits from the business.This book gives simple, easy to follow information about business that I believe most if not all business owners should learn.When's the next book Brad?"
1,Coaching Review,Those who are giving this book 5 stars will be the very same franchised business coaches who benefit from the sale of the book. Do not be sucked in as the book is very weak. There is no instant success with this book. The guy is a con artist. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1,Unethical Business Practice,"Here's another disappointed reader who noticed that many of the 5 star reviews were made by those associated with the author. Don't believe me? If you google a bunch of the 5-star reviewer names, you'll easily find that they are business coaches at Action International, who worked with the author to publish this book.Having said that, this book does indeed have some good ideas. However, one should always strive to succeed while acting ethically, and hire coaches who themselves will act ethically. The coaches at Action International have clearly demonstrated that they don't fall into that category."
1,Don't get sucked in...,"by the good reviews. I have never been inspired to actually write a review before, but this book is so bad I felt it was my duty to warn others. The writing is unbearable, and the information is not at all specific enough to be worthwhile. If you're a new or aspiring business owner read The E-Myth Revisited instead. If you're not new to business, this book is a total waste of money."
4,Good but...,"This book worked for me. I have used lots of the information, advice. I am a complete beginner so the story kept me interested.But, I listened to the book on tape and was totally distracted by how when ever someone speaks to another person, they use their name.""Coach, good idea""""Thanks Nelly""""What is your advice on cash Coach?""""Nelly good question. Cash is good""""Thanks for your opinion Coach""On and onNo one talks like that. It was as if they needed a larger word count for publishing. Very odd!"
3,Entry level and inexpensive,Not a lot of bells and whistles here. Just a nice basic piece of test equipment. Rock stable in my cold workroom. You're going to need a frequency counter and safecracker's skills to get it on frequency. There might have been a few more pennies spent on the vernier dial.
1,Junk!,"Unit looked very nice as I took it out of the package. However, when I placed it on the bench, I noticed that it rocked severely because the bottom of the case was warped by nearly 1/4"". When I tested it, I found that the frequency adjustment knob did not function, so I could not adjust the output frequency, which is the main function of this unit. The output frequencies I did get were very noisy, far exceeding the noise specifications that the specifications claim to achieve. A completely useless piece of junk that will be going back to the seller."
3,Hidden in the book....,"Agreed. This isn't everything for everyone. There is information for building a hot shop. The scope is beyond most people, but there is good information on the components required and the basic fabrication and assembly techniques. I you can afford a hot shop, you can afford assistance in fabrication and installing the gas system. Good luck."
4,"Good game, ok graphics","When I first played this game.....it was kinda hard.....but after I played it a couple of times it was a pretty good game. The best thing is the practice mode.....this helps you when you want to play in the tournements. The graphics could be better, but there still good. The sound is not good however. It doesnt go along with the game of golf.....but if you turn the sound of its too quiet....I suggest you put on a cd near by so you can listen to your own music while playing this cool golf game"
4,Hermoso,"Bello anillo que va con la persona que lo adquierio""pequeño pero como brilla!!!"" jajajaGracias"
4,its good,"I am no expert on rings, but the Zirconia looks kinda flat. Are these things supposed to look like diamonds? It is good quality though. Didn't know what the ""Promise ring"" stood for, so there was some rather awkward explanations when giving it to my gf. worth $20"
4,Worth the price,"This ring is definately worth the affordable price. It is by no means a high dollar looking ring. It is delicate and pretty, but I'm sure it will wear out with time. But still, a really great option for that special girl you want to show your affection towards."
1,"Pretty, but cheap","I have had this ring for 2 weeks, of which I have worn it about 4 days. There is no way this ring is sterling silver. After the first day of wear, my finger turned green. After the fourth day, it appeared so tarnished it was ridiculous and the ring has totally bent. I almost couldn't get it off my finger it is so misshapen. And before anyone asks, no I didn't wear it doing anything that would have caused it to bend. I sit at a desk all day and type for my job and I am usually on the computer most of the night at home. I wear tons of sterling silver rings and I have never had such a bad experience with one. Yes, the ring is very cute, but it is inexpensive for a reason... it will last about a week."
2,I really didn't like it,"I had a little shipping problem(no fault of the seller) and waited a long time for this ring. I was disappointed when I opened the box. It looks cheap to me. The setting for the stone is cheapo...not the band, but the metal the stone is actually set in. I've had it 2 years and have only worn it twice. It may work for a teenager. The band itself is nice and the stone size is small, just the way I wanted it. It has never tarnished. I know it was inexpensive, but it looks that way too....at least to me. Gem Avenue does sell some of the best snake chains I have ever seen in sterling. They are very durable and require little cleaning and they do not tarnish...period. I had mine for 2 years and wear them often. They are inexpensive, but very well made and good looking."
2,good for one night,"i got this ring so people wouldn't ""hit"" on me. i received it the first day it was expected and it came in a really cute box. i put it on immediately and wore it to work. i've had it for about three days now and i noticed it was fitting really weird. i took it off and its shape was completely distorted. it bends very easily. i took it off and put it on my key ring. i should have known better, because its so cheap. its really pretty, but only for about a night. then it bends like it was made from aluminum foil."
2,tarnished,"I gave this a 5 star rating 1 year ago, but the ring tarnished and the silver coating wore off in a year. My daughter loved it, but I am disappointed that it did not hold up better. The design is beautiful and we had no problems with the stone falling out like the other reviewer."
4,nice ring,"I bought this ring from Amazon over a year ago. It is still pretty, although very slightly worn out - as it usually happens with low-cost silver.It am satisfied and I would buy it again.The worst review here claims that this made her finger turn green and it bent within a week. NOTHING like that happened to me.Sterling silver is 7.5 percent copper which can turn green, and some people seem to have body chemistry that's prone to staining. This happens if a person is on the ""sweaty"" side and has a natural high acidity level. Another reason may be reaction with lotions and some chemicals."
2,Did not resonate...,I recently started in a new leadership position within my company. I was truly hoping for some insight and guidance around answering the tough questions... especially because I tend to be introspective and thoughtful and find it difficult at times to articulate a quick response.I did not find that in this book. I found the examples too obscure and contrary to the point being made (many of the political speech examples just didn't seem to exemplify the advice being given.) And I found myself getting stuck in trying to figure out what Roman Pillars had to do with anything...I was disappointed and hope to find a book that actually resonates with me.
5,must read,"Ever wonder how politicians look so comfortable when asked difficult questions? Believe me, after reading this informative book, it's not their DNA. If you follow the advice in this book, you'll be in control, no matter what the question. Ignore this book at your peril."
3,Examples..,"Book is a good read. Although, the examples in this book are all about polital figures not everyday examples, it is still a well worth read!"
4,Guide to Dealing with Difficult Questions,"This book gives the reader some simple and effective tools/strategies for dealing with difficult questions, and more importantly tells you what to avoid. To illustrate the techniques Weissman uses contemporary examples mostly from politics. Given the application of the book to business, it would have been good to see some more examples from the business world.This book will be hugely beneficial for anyone prepapring for an important public speech with Q&A;."
1,Wrong bowl,"I have ordered this item several times and they always send it with a regular cereal bowl. It is shown with a pedestal bowl, but have never been sent the one pictured."
2,What's not in the package,"Seems like an OK product, however it does not come with any cables or screws to mount it. You have to connect negative to negative on your 2 batteries which adds interference to the fish finder and other instrumentation. Claims Mini, but about 3 inches high."
4,Book #5 of the Blaine/McCall saga is as fabulous as the rest,"Ginna Gray tells the story of another of the McCall brothers, Ryan. This book is of the same quality as the rest of the series. I reccommend it!"
5,"A great dictionary for intermediate ESL, not for TOEFL!","I am a professional ESOL instructor and think that this dictionary is one of the best. However, it is not the easiest dictionary to use and understand because the language and definitions are not as clear and simple as the language and definitions in other ESL dictionaries.Even though this is a good dictionary, I do NOT use it with my students for one reason: the English in this dictionary is closer to British English and most of my students need to study American English, especially my TOEFL students. So, if you are studying TOEFL, I would NOT recommend this dictionary.However, if you are an intermediate ESL student or above, and are studying international English, this dictionary is one of the best and the price is great!"
4,The Complete Book of Slackers,"It was fun finding out that there are so many loafers, including so many famous and accomplished people. But there were too many for me. And the apparent qualifications for getting into the book, I think, were too subjective. I would have prefered fewer slackers coverd in greater depth (the more famous ones). If Tom Lutz's goal was to smoothly and skillfully mention ever last slacker he uncoverd during his research -- he did a heck of a good job."
2,For History Buffs only,"Sorry, but I could only recommend this book to someone who wants nothing, but dry history. The author managed to take a really fun and interesting subject and turn it into a lifeless thesis. I expected stories about actual loafers, not quotes about loafing from intellectuals."
2,eh,"I don't know how Tom managed to take such a fun subject and just suck the life right out of it. The subject and people he covers are interesting despite his best efforts, but if you ever wondered why English teachers have a reputation for ruining great literature for youngsters world-wide, well, you won't after you read this. The book is not engaging in any way, but rather you feel like Tom is taking the extensive research he did for the book and whacking you in the face with it. It's essentially a very wordy list of people who at one time or another over the last 300 years had some sort of opinion on the nature of work. As you might imagine, this is a long list. If you find this book at a used book store or maybe sitting on a bench in a train station I'd say go for it, but otherwise your money would be better spent elsewhere."
4,Fascinating!,"As a person who has managed to do nothing quite a bit of the time, I love this book! I'm only half finished, but I am enjoying it immensely."
5,Addicting Fun,"This is a great game if you like Pokemon or other monster rasing RPGS. Its very addicting and although I've only played 3 hours, I can see its a long game; especially if you want to get all the Digimon. Unlike Pokemon which limits you to what your Pokemon can evolve into, in this game there are several digivolutions for your Digimon and you can always go back on a stage and change it up. There are also alot of quests which is deifferent from Pokemons linear questline. Overall I recommend getting this if you like these kinds of games or Digimon."

2,direction cards--- not a book!,"This is a set of cards to make learning centers suitable for preschool- 2 grade. The cards can be mounted and the student can follow picture directions to make the recipes. Each student makes his/her own individual serving in a small paper cup. There are only four recipes in this set of cards. Three of the recipes do not require cooking. They are Lemonade, Peanut Honey Balls and Cottage Cheese Dip. The quick bread recipe uses a mix and is baked in an electric skillet. Cooking in a paper cup in an electric skillet does work and is a fun activity for a group. I am not sure that these four recipes for the amount charged is worth the money. However, the skills emphasised are good. There are 22 cards in the set and directions for setting up the center. My first grade students enjoy this type of activity and look forward to our cooking days."
4,Rebus-type cooking cards,"Saw these several years ago and had to have them for a recent cooking project with preschoolers. These are picture recipe cards for step-by-step ""cooking"" projects; 3 of the 4 recipes do not require any cooking. If mounted on fan-fold cardstock, they are easier to follow along with, especially when using them for a group. The lemonade recipe is a big hit, using real lemons to squeeze and measure lemon juice. Promotes great math and measuring concepts, as well as fine motor skills. A bit pricey for the set, but worth it if you don't have time to make the rebus cards yourself!"
4,Perfect for city dwellers,We live in the city and tight on space so this was a perfect solution. Very well made like our Oeuf Classic Crib so was pleased with the quality and safety. And we won't be stuck with a big piece of baby furniture in a few years! Only gave it 4 stars as it is only a changing station with no features but there is nothing to complain about!
5,Read the description,"I have been using the wireless fence system that goes with this collar for a few months. While there are some limitations due to its wireless feature, you have to decide what feature is most important to you. No, you cannot allow your dog to go to specific areas - you get a circle around your house. Yes, the boundary does vary due to interference and takes some time to set-up to maximize the area around the house. This was a slight issue during training but now my dog knows that the beep means back-up. If you move a lot, or you take your dog on trips, this is perfect. I am here ordering a second collar for our new puppy. Please read the description, the product is a receiver - it receives the signal from the wireless fence system. It is not the fence itself. Don't rate this product poorly because you didn't understand what you were ordering!"
1,I did not get what I ordered,"I did not get the plug in transmiter, I only got the collar, I would like to know if I make a mistake by ordering this product, I was waiting for the collar and something else to set the perimeter for a zone. I got the collar but without the transmiter to set the zone this collar is not good at all. I would like to know why I did not get everything together, because it does not make any sence in buying the collar if there is nothing to set the perimet for the area. According to the direction this transmiter you plug in 110 volts outlet. So please help me with this, Thans Willyam Galvez"
5,very informative,the book helped me to understand more about the bloodhound breed. IT also helped me understand what a handler needs to know.
3,Not the best resource.,"We found this book to be lacking in the number of entries/words it carries. My daughter is in a 3rd grade GT class, and a number of the words on her spelling list are not even included in this book. I find the book to be average, at best."
2,"Scholastic Dictionary for Synonyms, Antonyms, and H. . .","I got this book to expand on my vocabulary but found it limited. I prefer antonyms and synonyms to Thesarus as they give a more direct and quick understading of words by contrasting them to other common words. Unfortunately, I found this book limited in the number of words identified."
5,Teacher loves it,This dictionary was complimented on by my child's teacher and suggested as a must buy for the other children. I love Amazon's suggestions b/c had I not purchased the MW children's dictionary I would have never found this synonyms/antonyms/homonyms dictionary. It also arrived quickly (less than 5 days).
2,poor binding,"This is a simple book, geared for the elementary student. Content seems fine, but the binding and quality of paper is poor. I suspect it will fall apart before the year is over."
4,Inexpensive Thesaurus,"I purchased a copy of this inexpensive thesaurus for all of my school's fourth graders and the teachers report they are great. They especially like how the thesaurus includes antonyms. These books are paperback and the page material did not seem very durable to me. If you need something more durable, you may want to check to see if there is a hard cover edition."
3,Filofax pen,The pen arrived broken so I wasn't able to test it. However the vendor responded immediately and sent a return lablel. I was disappointed because I expected the pen to be slimmer and fit in a small Louis Vuitton organizer which is designed to fit filofax accessories. It was too thick to fit the pen loop. It also seems little pen for the money.
4,"Straight Talk from ""Jay Hawk""","Most jazz fans will know Carmell Jones from his tenure with Horace Silver, but the trumpeter also made some excellent albums as a leader. ""Jay Hawk Talk,"" recorded on 5/8/65 for the Prestige label, features Jimmy Heath on tenor sax, Barry Harris on piano, George Tucker on bass, and Roger Humphries on drums. The disc is split evenly between Jones originals (the title track, ""Dance of the Night Child,"" and ""Beepdurple"") and standards. All of the tunes are thoroughly enjoyable, hard-swingin' numbers but I was hoping for something a bit more searching from Jones, more akin to his playing on ""Song for My Father."" Those interested in talking to ""Jay Hawk"" should note that this is a limited edition title, and it will fly away shortly. For further listening, also check out the recently issued ""Mosaic Select"" set featuring Carmell's recordings as both leader and sideman for the Pacific label."
4,Volley ball net,I bought this for my 13 year old niece for her birthday. The other ones she has had kept falling apart and would blow over in the wind. I couldn't afford the professional ones and this one fit my budget just right. It is sturdy and well made and she will get many years of enjoyment out of it. It was also very easy to assemble and was delivered when promised.
1,Terrible,"This machine is a piece, anything laminated over 3mil comes out with ripples and the rollers fall off track. I'm not sure about there other products but for $250 there has to be something better!"
3,Do you really live in the South?,"In the introduction you talk about the ""way it was"". Please know the difference between a cotton boll and THE Cotton Bowl !"
1,Seriously flawed.,"This map is seriously flawed. Parallels are incorrectly identified (16th parallel as the 15th, 17th as the 16th, etc.)The boundary between the Mountain and Central Time Zones is not between Nayarit and Sinaloa states as depicted, but between Nayarit and Jalisco states. A minor, yet annoying, problem is too-faint contour lines without elevations. Maps, even those focusing on tourist destinations, should provide accurate, easily-accessible information."
2,Not a lot of detail,"Map shows only major roads and larger towns. It's helpful for a general overview of region, but that's about all. Printed on only one side..."
5,The Losers are awesome!!,"I loved ""The Losers! It was exciting and fun! I especially enjoyed Chris Evans and Columbus Short!"
4,Underrated,"This film packs a punch to the head that I was very surprised by. I think the film did not get its due since it was released close to Kick Ass which I also enjoyed. The cast is great, the action is great, and the style is very unique. Blu ray transfer is right on."
3,Losers Review,The dvd arrived when it was promised and I was anxious to view it. Losers did entertain me but I was expecting a bit more to be honest. I was expecting something along the lines of a Rocka Roller but overall I wasn't disappointed other than having one of the stars killedat the end.
4,"If you like action, you'll like this movie (skip it if you don't).","The Losers is an action movie with very little character development, and a ridiculous ending. In other words, it's a great movie (but only if your into that type of film). Sit back, don't think about it too much, and enjoy the ride."
4,"Good, mindless fun","People who don't like this film say that the movie has plot holes or that it's simple. That's sort of the point. It's a good, old-fashioned action film. It has good looking studs, hot women, cool weapons, a bad-ass villain and numerous explosions. It's meant to be a ride, not an Oscar-worthy, mind-bending drama. Enjoy it for what it is - fun."
3,The Losers,"Although entertaining action did anyone besides me feel like this was basicly another A-Team movie? It has pretty much the same premise, a team of soldiers are framed and have to get the commander that framed them. They put together a plan, and get assistance from someone inside the government to stop the madman that framed them and is planning to blow up more real estate than they ever could. They are given great weapons and explosives to shoot many, many bad guys and to blow lots of stuff up. Good quality DVD with bonus material. If you enjoyed this catchThe A-Team.CA Luster"
3,PG-13 Action Yarn,"The Losers, based on a comic with the same name, is about a group of mersenaries who are double-crossed by their boss and decide to pay him back for all the trouble.The movie does push the PG-13 boundries. Lots of explosions, lots of gunfire and some corny dialog is peppered throughout this film to keep your interest up; but this film gets pretty tedious since the plot and the dialog is recycled from the A-Team.Its worth watching once."
5,Great customer service,I was sold on the customer service of this company. I would gladly purchase from this company again. I recommend others to use this company as well.
3,Disappointing,"This movie was a disappointment for me, it was very hard for me to follow. The one redeeming quality for me was Idris Alba."
2,Okay.,"The movie is okay, but it left a lot to be desired. It had potential, but didn't quite reach it. Save this one for when you're truly bored and anything will do."
2,Boring,"What a boring ""action"" movie. The script and dialogue sucked. Just color by numbers flat flick."
4,DO-OVER,"Sorry I liked it but wasn't impressed with as much as first one.Plus getting tired of the big bang endings, lame beginnings.........."
1,The Title Gives It Away.,"This movie was awful. An A-Team knock off with about equal depth of acting, TV show not the 2010 remake, and the brewing action could be dissolved with a mild antacid. It seemed that the director was distracted through the movie by something else; perhaps, the only distracting feature of the entire thing, Zoe Saldana. There is a hot scene where she and Jeffrey Dean Morgan duke it out in a burning hotel room - I suggest skipping to that scene and when it's finished remove the DVD from the player. You won't be losing out on much.Oh, yeah! And there's a bad guy, who I almost forgot about. He was so fresh out of the bad-guy-action-movie mold that he himself looked loss; searching around the globe for exotic locales that have not been over used by the more orignal, the more menacing. He failed to be even an entertaining plot device, nay tool.The original comic was set in WWII, that would have been a better jumping off point."
1,They won't get my money,I usally will rent a movie before I purchase it ....these guys decided to force me to watch all their previews and commercials before I could see the movie... Bad move... that was enough to make me forget about ever watching their movie and there fore ever ever ever being interested in purchasing their dvd or blue rayI don't usally mind a 'no access to menu' dvd if they only force me to watch a couple of previews... but this one 13 previews.... (and that was only the ones that I counted before I hit the eject button)These know there is a such thing as Youtube right? I mean really they aren't that stupid are they?Anyway I just wanted to make sure that someone heard my protest against desperate advertisers....and they are killing it for everybody...NO I did not purchase this item... Duh!
2,tries to be way too cool,They shoulda had more of the bad guy.Really tryign to be way too cool and the main guy who is ancient goon gets with who?wtf!!!as realistic as transformers!
1,A dead-set LOSER of a movie.,"I vary rarely write a review, but I HAD to write one for this film because it is SOOOO BAD. I wish I could rate it zero stars. The only reason I didn't turn the movie off was because of the eye candy that is Zoe Saldana. I'm so glad I only wasted $6 at the DVD store instead of $15 at the movies.It's a disgrace that movies like this actually get made - it was complete rubbish. I mean, WTF was there a Ducati delivered (to a billionaire who could afford to buy the whole company) with those 4 bombs? And how can someone walk 5 minutes after being shot in both legs? It was just rubbish.DON'T WASTE YOU TIME!!!!"
2,Lots of Action,"I like action movies and this one has lots of it. That isthe good part. This movie was entertaining and I did notfall asleep in the middle of it.Perhaps it was intentional, but coloring looked little off.Also some of the stunts were off the top. Like, towards the endof the movie the guy flying into a jet engine from the motorcycle.Realistic? No. Entertaining? Depends on your sense of humour.I think A-Team is a lot better movie, with similar plot."
5,Thought it was great,"Wasn't a classic, but would def buy it! I saw it at the movies, and glad I did. I loved it!"
4,Losers,"Action all the way. I would love to see a sequel with this bunch of actors. They are not a bunch of losers, but are a big hit with me."
5,Some of the most fun I have had in a long time!,"My husband, 9 year old daughter and I watched this movie because nothing else was on. We have since watched it a couple of more times and are looking to purchase it on Blue Ray and regular DVD. The movie was alot of fun and was full of action. My daughter is still throwing quotes out from the movie (and there were some great ones)!"
4,You get what you expect,"Solid movie with solid action, not going to win any oscars but thats not what its trying to do. Solid and entertaining"
2,Had promise..,"This movie was cheesy. Acting was terrible and many scenes came off as awkward. To bad, it started off looking like it was going to be a fun movie... nope, I kept on torchering myself to very end of it, in the hope that it would get better. Ok, there where some cool action scenes, but not worth your time...."
2,"Review of ""The Losers"" - movie only",Brief review of the movie only. So-so acting (least impressive is the main villain). Zoe Saldana is easy on the eye. Some stunts in particular are well beyond realistic. There are better action flicks to spend your time on.
3,"Decent Action Flick, Good Acting, so-so Plot","****SPOILER FREE REVIEW****I love the acting and characterization. Even though there are a lot of characters, they did a decent job of getting them across to the audience. Again, the acting and dialogue was decent.unfortunately, the plot was a touch on the thin side. The villain is almost cartoonish in his depth and actions and that was to the detriment of the film (even though his performance was good).I would have rated this film higher, but truthfully this action genre has a lot of good films in it like the Bourne Series, Transporter, etc and this film is not at that level by any stretch (no fault of the acting, script is just weak).So, I had to give it 3 stars. If you need an action flick to tide you over, this is not a bad selection. It is okay, Zoe is hot, the guys are funny, acting is decent."
4,"Fun movie! It out-""A-Team""'s the A-Team!","This is a solid popcorn movie that also doesn't insult your intelligence (well, not too much). It seem like often Hollywood movies have to be both smart and pretentious, or just mindless entertainment. Here we have a smart movie that's really all about the ride, not the sermon. That's refreshing."
3,The Losers is pretty good,"The losers is a fairly good film. There is plenty of action and humor. Its a movie that can always make me laugh, the dialog between the characters is priceless at times. However with that said i often found myself expecting more than the film gave. I would often think there has to be more in terms of setting, plot, and characters/personalities. It might have just been me but i for some reason always felt something in the film was missing but never could really put my finger on what exactly. Other than that the film will make you laugh and give you action worth the time.Overall The Losers is a comical action packed thrill ride that is enjoyable to watch, 3 out of 5 stars."
3,Am ... not sure about this one,"It had action. It had a decent bad guy, scary and intimidating in a strange way. It had a great hero - great Jeffrey Dean Morgan who played in the Watchmen and there was a fairly decent plot.But somehow, for me, it didn't rise above the level of a mediocre action flick. I think there are two reasons for that. The acting / plot / heroes were exagerated at times, as if they were a caricature of themselves, which made taking the film seriously difficult, and I understand the film is based on comics which I didn't read and it seemed fully understanding the film depends on the comics.It was not a bad film but with a cast this good a much better film could have been made."
1,Stupid,"Stupidest action movie I have seen in a long time. No compelling characters, lame script and plot, no character development to help you be invested in any outcomes.Save your money and watch something else..."
2,not my cup of tea,"The highlight of this movie is Jason Patric's stance on sun exposure but it wasn't enough to keep me watching through all the ""action"" and the accompanying dialogue related to this being an ""action"" movie. Ugh."
4,Understand illness and cure yourself,"The information in this book may seem a little far out but if you can suspend disbelief and give it a try, you may be surprised and find that it does seem to work. A bit esoteric in spots, but overall practical and honest information. You've got nothing to lose but whatever your illness is. Well worth the read."
5,An excellent resource and food for thought,"This book was one of the main textbooks in my Introduction to Ethics class in Bible college. It proved to be an invaluable resource for pinpointing my own beliefs about ethics, and for applying them to current events.The book is a survey-type study of the various popular ethical theories in the world today. Ten theories are each evaluated according to their strengths, weaknesses, and their stature when measured by a Christian perspective.I would highly recommend this book to (1) professors searching for textbooks for introductory college ethics courses, and (2) students of ethics to whom the general topic is confusing. An excellent resource for both the beginner who wants to learn ethics, and the advanced student who needs a quick refresher course. I can't recommend it highly enough."
2,Ehh..,"I think i should've gotten the black one.. In fact the 1st hour i got it I thought i should return it. Its not a good fit, the edges are not even and the holes are misaligned slightly, but after awhile you learn to live with it and its not bad.. until.. the softer white part on the back of the case catches all sorts of dirt. Now this part is always dirty. But if you keep ur hands clean all the time its okay i guess. I work for aerospace my hands get dirt once in awhile on it."
4,unexpected,Excellent movie that portrays what happen when the interest for money is the most important thing in life. Maybe ther are not perfect marriages in the real world.
3,KATELAND,"FOOLED BY THE COVER....Judgeing by the cover of this DVD i thought it was about a marriage gone wrong, and they were showing us a picture of a very batterd wife. NO woman was batterd in this movie. This film is about a woman who is married for the second time, to a very nice wealthy man, and seems to have everything she ever wanted. But has a very bad habbit of going around jabbing needles into people. She believed that was one way of getting rid of them quickly. If she found anyone that was annoying."
1,Kiosk Rating <1,"If you're thinking of watching this, belated for a reason DVD release of a 2006 movie, based on the cover then just look at the cover because there's nothing in the movie like it. The scariest scenes are of a few seconds of seeing someone getting an injection and then feigning a heart attack. You'll get a greater thrill from just going to the hospital for an injection of saline (salt water) solution. The movie's writer must never have heard of forensics; needle marks; position of the body; security cameras, autopsies; weird coincidences and patterns and background checks, etc. A California divorce court would be a safer way to gain financial independence. Boringly predictable ending of bad girl dies and nice girl gets the boss and a position upgrade in the company.Even relative to it's comparable genre of TV romance soaps, this movie just doesn't hold up."
4,Not that bad....,"I actually liked this movie...just got done watching it. You kind of feel sympatheic toward Annie/Marianne until she (SPOILER) kills her father in law. She should have just offed Brent earlier in the film and been done with it. Towards the end, that's when you kind of decide, OK you're just a witch with a capital B. I do like Jamie Lunar in this role though."
1,Disappointed - George & Tammy DVD,"Disappointed. Not enough George & Tammy. Won't push for people to buy it. Actually it is a ""one' on the ""Like"" scale."
4,So cute!,"I really liked Allie and her family and athletic friends. They seemed like such genuinely nice people. Kudos to the author for writing an anti-Gossip Girl!I was pleasantly surprised to see that the author lives in Northampton, Massachusetts, which is relatively close to my section of Connecticut. It was just one of those fun tidbits to learn about an author, especially one whose book you enjoyed!This was the perfect Summer read - light, yet potent, and fast. The reality of change in relationships was handled very well and I came away from the book with a warm, fuzzy feeling and a smile. It is definitely recommended!"
3,a bit disappointing,"In the 25 years that I have owned my Christianshavn dinnerware, I haven't broken any plates...until I recently lost two, casualties of the war zone that is my kitchen.I ordered four replacements through this seller (delivered fast, on time, just what I ordered, and a great seller)...BUT, somehow they've stopped coating the blue edge around the outer rim. When you stack them together with the original ones, from the side, they don't look like the same pieces.On the table, they're fine. They're of good quality, etc. It's just disappointing that they don't match the originals in all aspects."
3,A Little Dissapointing,"I enjoyed the music featured in this book, however I did not feel that it highlighted the best music from an absolutley hilarios score."
1,Completely Stopped Working,"I bought it on December 7, 2008. It had a one year warranty. It quit working on January 2, 2010 after only being used about 10-15 times. I have a smaller coffee maker I use for everyday. I only use this one when I have company. Very Disappointing!"
4,"West Bend 54149 12-Cup Automatic Coffee Percolator, Stainless Steel",Makes great coffee and real hot also.I am a little diapointed about the cup indicator which only shows between 8 and 12 cups this makes it a real hassle when your filling it to make less than 8 cups.
1,Westbend electric percolator,Our Westbend percolator lasted only 9 months and was used ONLY three days a week. This is another example of junk made in China. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!!
2,Disappointed,"This pot has been a real disappointment. I love perked coffee because it taste better and is hotter than drip coffee,however, while the coffee is hot it stops brewing before the coffee is completely brewed. I have tried adding extra coffee and it still looks like colored water. I will go back to using my old drip pot until I can find another brand percolator that actually works."
2,west bend percolator,"Used the coffee pot everyday, Didn't last a year started leaking by the handle. To old to send back, nothing last anymore."
3,Topsy Turvy Percolator,"We have purchased several of these percolators in the past and were impressed with their performance. This poor percolator does the job but it is not made as quality as those we had in the past. It says ""stainless steel"" but the only parts that refers to are the basket and stem. The strangest thing about it is that the handle was installed upside down! Twelve cups is at the bottom of the clear guage, making the guage useless. I purchased it several months ago as a backup in case our other West Bend died of old age, so I only now discovered the mistake. In a way I think this peculiar percolator belongs in our strange family. We still recommend this particular model, just check it over carefully when it arrives."
2,West Bend 54149 Percolator,"The first one I received shut down after the brew cycle, so it did not keep the pot warm. In addition, the water fill indicator in the handle did not work, and this was truly why I decided to purchase this model. I returned the first one, and received my replacement. Amazon got me the replacement right away, and the replacement works, but still, the water fill indicator in the handle does not work, so it is very difficult to get the correct amount of water in the pot, especially in the groggy morning moments before coffee. I just kept this one anyway, as I couldn't be another day without a coffee maker."
1,my new coffee pot,I was very happy with the price and now that I have used it I think it is a very fine product. If I ever need a New pot it will be a West Bend product. Thanks very much. Jerris
3,It is a good percolator,Makes a good cup of coffee but you will need to adjust the amount of coffee grinds for your taste (stronger or weaker). Also the coffee comes out really hot (no kidding) and it stays hot for awhile. The cup indicator only shows between 8 and 12 cups- should be 2 to 12. Very easy to use and clean. It would have been good to have a temp gauge so you could make the coffee perk longer or shorter (to make a stronger or weaker coffee). Like all other products- this product is made in China. But it seems to be built good but only time will tell. What happen to made in the U.S.A!
1,Useless!,"Since I threw away the box and can not return this item, I am also throwing away the pot after trying to use it for one week. Float does not work in handle and there are no measurement indentations on inside of pot. Worst pot I have ever encountered."
2,angelogrammy,"water guide is hard to read. electric cord is very stiff. next time we need a new percolator, we will look into another."
2,broke after 3 months,"I bought this to replace a Farberware percolator which lasted only 1 year. It brewed extremely slow, but other than that I was satisfied. After 3 months it would not stop brewing unless I unplugged it. I contacted the company because it is under warranty, and was told that they sold their warranty department. After several attempts I have been unable to contact anyone. Complete waste."
3,Average percolator,"We've always preferred percolated coffee to drip but this coffeemaker really doesn't produce a great cup of coffee. We've been using it for almost a year with different brands of coffee and have yet to produce an exceptional brew. That said, it is a solid workhorse and seems fairly well made. The only thing that bugs us is cleaning it - there is a non-stainless steel nut in the inside bottom that seems to be a magnet for grinds and requires scrubbing instead of a quick rinsing. Nuisance."
1,Coffee was great. The pot falling apart.,"Bought this product six months ago and the coffee it brewed the first two were great. Then two quarter-sized burn marks appeared inside at the bottom on the pot that won't come out. The little clear plastic top cracked in the third month and now it falls off when you pour. When I was a kid, West Bend was one of the best. That was a long time ago. I've changed, and apparently so have they. But I won't be ""burned"" twice."
5,Great Coffee,The West Bend Percolator makes a great cup of coffee and keeps it nice and hot but not burnt tasting.
5,The best cd ever,This cd is a classic and it is one of the many best from Teena Marie it was so hard for me to find it and i am glad that i did
1,The idea is good,"After reading the reviews I bought this and it did not meet my expectations. The pill holder was difficult to open as others have also stated. I thought it would hold more than it did. So, I was disappointed. The delivery was on time, so no complaints from me on that. I will say this if you need a pill holder for bigger pills or vitamins, this is not it."
3,Some Probs,"The doors on the cells don't open wide; when you bend them back to break them in - they threaten to break off.Don't know how long it will last.Otherwise - easy to handle, clear to read."
2,Hard to open,This pill organizer is a good size however the compartments are very hard to open I would not recommend this product for anyone without fingenails I have to use a butter knife
5,Useful and sturdy!,"I bought two sets, and I'm very pleased with the construction of the containers. The compartment lids snap shut with enough force to not pop open on their own, but not so difficult it can't be open one handed. I like the fact they're square, so it's easy to rotate them such that the day label isn't visible when a day's through (for those of us who don't know what day of the week it is until the second or third cup of coffee). All in all, of all the pill organizers I've ever handled, this is one of the best."
3,Monica Ferris latest Betsy Devonshire book,"The mystery series set in a small town in Minnesota are a pleasant read. As you progress through the series (and I recommend starting at the beginning with Crewel World)you develop an affection for the recurring characters. This book, however, was disappointing in two aspects. It is set at a needlework convention in Nashville, so the regular characters are absent. We have been following main character Betsy Devonshire's growing romantic interests in preceeding books, and I missed it here! The other problem, for me, is that the flashback style of writing in this book just missed the mark. Flashback writing is an art, and Monica Ferris can develop a linear story so well, she should leave flashback to more literary writers.That said, I look forward to the next book in the series."
2,goodbye Crewel world,"Cozy mysteries are generally rather cute, short on suspense and long on ""charm"". Good for a beach read, but otherwise unsatisfying. Crewel Yule certainly meets those criteria. But except for its very lengthy, mostly tedious descriptions of various needlework plans and patterns, there really isn't much to it. The dozens of crafters who make up most of the cast are stereotypical housewife types, and Betsy's 2 best friends are caricatures, one of a swishy gay man (Goddy) and one of a capable female cop who is apparently willing to work without pay. The reader is forced to listen to her explanation of what she is doing every time she interviews a suspect. And the motives of the various suspects are repeated more times than I could count. Except for the murderer and victim, everyone is so nice. I enjoy various types of needlework, including crossstitch and crewel, but didn't find much to enjoy in this tale, especially not the commercials."
2,Okay for what it was.,"For a genre mystery this book was okay, but only just. The mystery was way too easy to solve near the beginning of the book which was a great disappointment because the characters were interesting and fun. The settings were well depicted and the needlework trivia handled well. I did not find the Nashville characters very believable, but I'm picky about that. YMMV. It was a way to pass the time, but there are better books out there of this ilk."
3,Justice When Mercy Would Have Been Better,"(Contains possible spoilers) This book, in part because it took place among people marooned in a storm didn't offend by misunderstanding its location, but it was ultimately not satisfying. The victim was so unsympathetic, and the suspects so sympathetic, that it was difficult to anticipate the final unveiling or, I suppose, unraveling. I kept thinking that the author was going to pull off a surprise ending by showing that someone else was responsible for deeds attributed to the victim or by coming up with totally unexpected villain, but no luck."
3,A Crafty Christmas Caper,"I'm a sucker for any mystery that's craft-related and set at Christmas time -- this book by Monica Ferris fits the bill. While I found the writing approach (different points of view, flashing forward and back in time) to be quite confusing, the writng itself was clear and entertaining. And though I'm not a needleworker, the descriptions of the patterns and samplers were so compelling that I feel the urge to pick up a needle and some floss!Not a bad book, but not particularly memorable, either."
3,Bizarre...,"Apparently this is the Greg Wood who went to high school in Clinton, Missouri in the mid '90s. How weird. Did his career ever go anywhere? (I haven't actually heard the album.)"
5,Searched far and wide,"Already owned a copy of this, but my daughter loved it so much she wanted one of her own. Very glad to have found it"
4,delivery service,"The book arrived 2 days after the estimated delivery date which is not that bad because I choose standard shipping but I was hoping it would arrived on time because it was given as a gift. I will ask my fiance about his opinion on the book when he is done reading it. So far, he said, it has a lot of information that would help him especially this time that he is looking for a job."
4,Sales tricks from the street,"I'm not a salesperson, though I occasionally get peripherally involved in the sales process. For a person of my profile, this book is certainly useful; for people who've been in the field, I'm not sure if there's a lot here. There's something warm and earthy about the way Gitomer makes his points, and his humorous style makes it easy to go through the book. At times the book comes across as a motivational guide with the author cheerleading the readers through the sales techniques. Judging by the structure of the book (the name of the first chapter is Genesis!) and his style of writing and introduction, one can see why he is successful at what he does."
2,"Not too bad, but not a 5 star title","I purchased this book after reading suggestions from other readers. After reading it, I have a hard time understanding why many people gave this book 4-5 stars. Granted, there were some good ideas in the book and the writing style was engaging at at times. However, there was a large portion of the book that focused on the need for positive attitude in a sales career and the means by which to ensure that such good attitude is maintained. IMHO if you have not realized the importance of a positive attitude, ability to handle regection, and the importance of a sense of humor in your sales career from your own experience, then you have been asleep at the wheel. I did find some good ideas from the first 1/2 of the book, but the remainder was pretty sad. For the first time sales person (such as myself) I got a heck of a lot more out of the Accidental Salesperson."
1,Garbage!!!!!,"All 5-star reviews you see here must have been written by Gitomer himself! If this book is a bible, then I am Ghandi! It is a cliche upon a cliche upon a cliche! Trite, condescending, stupid - and those are its positives. Thank God I did not buy this, but found it in the garbage, where it rigtfully belonged. If you think this book will help you buy a house and 2 cars, like that other clown(probably Gitomer himself), then please call me- I have a house, 2 cars, and a bridge for sale."
4,A Great Resource for New Salespeople,"Albeit the fact that this book is a great resource for new salespeople, you'll be somewhat disappointed if you are already an experienced sales or MLM professional -- This book is weak in the area of ""closing sales"".For the more experienced sales professional, I would recommend Duane Lakin's ""The Unfair Advantage"" instead.James LeongAuthor of The World's First Book on Network Marketing with NLP,""MLM Persuasion Mastery: How Master Networkers Change Beliefsand Behavior"""
5,for EVERYONE,"EVERYONE sells ALL the time - whether it's your product, service, or yourself - and everyone needs to read everything Jeffrey Gitomer writes - especially this classic!"
1,I have no clue why his books are rated so highly,"I ordered this book expecting to learn about sales techniques and to get more sales. Instead all I got was a bucket full of cliches about having a positive attitude.First of all I have no idea why Gitomer is a sales guru. I can't find information on what he sold before he became a sales guru whether its insurance, or vacuum cleaners.Secondly, I have nothing against a positive mental attitude or cultivating good relationships, but just having those things won't make you a good salesman just as it won't make you a good athlete.Again, I have no clue why his books are rated so highly."
5,This book motivated me to get into sales.,Somewhat funny and easy read. Gitomer is good at what he does: sales. It's moreless practical book. I suggest read it if you are just getting into sales.
1,"This book sucks ""DON'T BUY IT""",This book sucks. I have not read many books on sales but I still say this book sucks. I can write this 300 page of crap in this review.Step one make a to do listStep two do what is on the to do listThree be honestFour be persistentI would like to know who gave this piece a good review. I wasted $12 bucks on it. Buy a different book this one is worthless.And another question; who would publish such a big pile of crap?
5,The Sales Bible,This book brings all aspects of selling into focus whether you are a rookie or seasoned veteran this book needs to be by your side. It truely is a tool for the trade. Don't leave the office without it.
1,Book was damaged. The packing box looked like it had been abused. .,The box the book arrived in was beat up pretty bad. There was a second book in the box that didn't get messed up. Maybe because it was a hard cover book?
2,"Average, but only just...","I'm sorry, this book is I'm sure fine for someone who is just starting out in low level commodity based selling but anyone with any experience should not buy this book.I really wanted to like this book, it's easy to read and Gitomer is a good entertaining writer - hense the 2 stars. But that's where the value ends. There is nothing here that can be considered new or even interesting. To call this book the Sales Bible is like calling your car's manual 'A History of the Automobile'. Buy The One Minute Salesperson if you want the basic entry to sales at a low level or Solution Selling, Spin Selling or anything by Rackham for advanced. I recommend these books with one word of warning - if you aren't making the sales calls don't buy the books looking for the courage as so many of us have. Just start making those calls. Now.The Sales Bible is not good enough."
2,Kinda a Boring read.,"Okay, so I thought this guy was kinda Guru but, he seems to be more full of hot air. I had a hard time getting through this book with all the B.S this guy tries to sell. Seems like all he wants people to do is keep buying his stuff. Yep, He's a salesman alright but I doubt a very good one. If, you like reading a book by somebody with nothing more then a huge ego then this book is for you."
4,Chapter - by - Chapter Reader's Guide of The Da Vinci Code,"This book is a compilation of the literary, artistic and historical references in Dan Brown's brilliant thriller ""The Da Vinci Code"". In much the same way that Dan built his novel on the brilliant, fascinating, and just plain odd stories that make up our history and culture, this compilation is built on the web pages, images and analysis that others have created to enhance your enjoyment of reading ""The Da Vinci Code.""It is presented in a chapter-by-chapter format so that the reader will be able to see available references and weblinks as they read (or reread) The Da Vinci Code."
3,Not bad,"Betsy Eble does a reasonably competent job of walking through some of the issues in Dan Brown's novel, but it doesn't compare to Steve Kellmeyer's ""Fact and Fiction in the Da Vinci Code"" (0971812861). Eble's discussion of Jesus and Mary Magdelene, for instance, doesn't cover the obvious argument that Kellmeyer brings forward. Brown's assertion that Mary Magdelene came from the line of Benjamin is used by Kellmeyer to demonstrate why this simple fact makes it virtually impossible to believe she was wedded to Jesus or given any authority in the Church. Eble misses the whole line of reasoning.Similarly, not nearly enough is done with the fact that much of Dan Brown's ""theology"" is based in 19th century German anti-Semitic theories concerning the origins of Scripture. Likewise, the Wiccan connections to German influences on England between the two world wars is pretty much overlooked.In short, Eble has done a pretty good job, but Kellmeyer does a better one."
1,Do Not Buy This CD,"Cheap budget reissue of a great cd, which is still available in its original form from Amazon.com. Cover art is a bad scan from the Canadian cd cover. NO BOOKLET WITH LINER NOTES. Lots of typos and mistakes. A horrible package. DO NOT BUY THIS CD."
2,Chipmunk at Hollow Tree Lane,"This book tells about a chipmunk getting ready for all the obstacles that comes with winter and all of the problems chipmunk has to face to succeed. Even though, there really isnt a moral to this particular story, it is a good book just to imagine all the things the chipmunk must go through.Yes, I would recommend tis book, because there is some action parts, chipmunk must face, which is quite interesting. I liked this book.Lynsi"
3,Buen libro pero mala calidad.,"Me encanto leer este libro, especialmente porque no leo frecuentemente en español y necesitaba un libro divertido y fácil de leer. La única queja que tengo de este libro es que las páginas empezaron a despegarse y caerse del libro. Fue muy frustrante leerlo porque temía que las páginas siguieran despegándose. Sería mejor comprarlo en libro de bolsillo porque tiene 640 páginas y va a ser difícil leerlo sin dificultad. He tenido que leerlo parcialmente cerrado para prevenir que se dañe mas. ¡Sin este problema, el libro recibiría cinco estrellas!"
1,Horrible,"never buy this gun. I bought it thinking it was full auto but when I got it it came with no battery and half put together. Then a month later the cocking handle broke, and another thing is the mag only holds 10 rounds. In all this gun sucks!!!"
3,bad for airsoft,"The Double Eagle M37 Powerful Airsoft Gun 330 FPS FAST!!! w/ LASER LIGHT, Red-dot Aim Sight is an ok gun for airsoft why i rate this gun as a 3 star is that sometimes when u fire the BBs curve and go up and down this gun is powerful but not accurate so if u want a good gun to have an airsoft war with don't get this gun"
1,Don't Buy This Book,"This book was incredibly dull, with the author making the same points over and over. Mr. Cuomo seemed to be more interested in twisting Lincoln's words and actions to fit his political agenda rather than informing the reader about the subject matter. I found no new or particularly interesting information on Lincoln here. A better bet is to look into one of the many other great books on Lincoln."
4,Mild Polemic Against the Present Bush Administration..,"This is very short, easy to read commentary on the greatness of Lincoln, and on how Abe's speeches and actions can be relevent today. Needless to say, in the comparisons between the Great Emancipator and the current Administration, Abe easily overwhelms Bush II,&Co. Gov. Cuomo's main point is the Lincoln's actions and words were for all time, and addressed to everybody,literally in all lands. His thoughtful, last resort approach to war is contrasted with the current deceptive drive to war in Iraq. Cuomo suggests that FDR and Lincoln had a lot in common in attempting to aid those who have troubles helping themselves. He also states that Lincoln's ecumenical religious approach is in sharp contrast to today's GOP. All in all, a thoughtful argument, and the author's criticisms are never overwrought. In fact, he seems to make a special effort to maintain civility throughout the book."
1,Worst Lincoln book EVER!,"There are more than 4000 books that have been written on Abraham Lincoln. I own about 100 and have read 200. Why Lincoln Matter's by Mario Cuomo should have been entitled: Why I Don't Matter. It is hard to find much about Lincoln in the book. There is much about how America has failed to measure up.Chris BradleyBethesda, Md."
3,Pretty Good,"If you are looking for a game that's a challenge, here you go. I guess this game is pretty entertaining if you can manage to get past the first few levels. To me, it's entertaining but iritating. I like to play a game that give's me a good challenge but also doesn't drive me crazy because it is so hard. So, overall, if you want an almost immpossible challenge, I would say this game is worth some of the prices it's selling for."
5,thumb print book,The product was as advertised and arrived as scheduled. It suits the purpose for which it was ordered. Definitely would order again.
5,thumb drawing book,"This is a really cute book for kids. My grandchildren love it and it is fun to see the ""characters"" they come up with using their own thumb prints...Highly recommend this to keep at Grammas' house."
5,Love it!,"I purchased all three books, some of it was the same but not enough not to get all three books. Cannot wait to paint with the kids. Very clever and easy painting."
5,What fun!,These are classic books that expand imagination. How could you not love them? I especially like how they encourage kids to draw without making it *too* detail oriented. (Alot can be achieved with a few simple lines!)
1,A Work of Fiction,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that this is most likely a work of fiction. There is no real information given about the supposed author, Helmut Jung, other than his ""incredible"" wartime exploits. There are too many mistakes in the book about Jung's training and service to believe this is anything more than a piece of fiction put together by the American writer...it doesn't read or feel right. Save your money and buy ""Black Edelweiss"" for a real biography of a German soldier."
3,But Not For The Fuehrer,"I am somewhat of a skeptic after having read many of the past and current ""memoirs"" of German veterans, but, then, who is to know whether it is real or concocted by someone familiar with the memoirs of others and other books on the Ost Front?Having interviewed veterans, it reads like a series of interviews transcribed with editing by someone who was not all that familiar with what the veteran was communicating to him. Or is that it was meant to read like to give it plausibility?Flip a coin?Excruciating book to plow through - but, then, the subject is attritional as was the war - particularly on the Eastern Front.Then again, the average German was not that well educated and neither is/was the average American. Then, this might tend to make it more authentic.It is difficult to determine whether it is a memoir or not. I would go with the electronic book as opposed to the hard copy when normally I would go for the hardbound (had I to do it all over again)."
3,Worth your time,"Crudely edited but a compelling and riveting chronicle of a German soldier. It looks and feels like a self-published work and there is little to no background on the author nor the narrator... but even with those shortcomings, I couldn't put it down and passed it on to friends."
1,This is really bad,"I bought this book because it was recommended by someone writing in another publication. I wish I had spent some time reading the other Amazon customer reviews before plunking down my cash.The book is simply unbelievable. No ancient veteran could remember such details, and no one except Zelig could have been witness to such a series of events. The writing is uneven, and it doesn't look like any editor ever reviewed the text."
4,Great Book - Still one of the better primers on WPF,"The book is well organized and very easy to read. It captures both the novice as well as those who have been working in WPF since beta (or is that CTP). The only complaints I have for the book are really just complaints on WPF in general. A lot of the material in the book (as well as WPF in general) focuses on making fairly outlandish applications (getting all the wizz bang features and animations). What I find lacking are items like validation, threading (when having a long background task), and items more akin to Windows Forms development. This book was an invaluable tool while I put together my first WPF application."
5,This book is necessary,"I'm an author that was lucky enough to perform dev reviewing on this book. As an author, I became quite jeolous: Ian and Chris managed to quickly, and quite succinctly, tell a rich, engaging story in a way that I wish I could. Consequently, if you need to quickly get up to speed on the concepts of the WPF and XAML, this is the book for you.Also, I'm ordinarily wary of books on beta technologies. However, this book is of a high quality and should be a great aid for enabling interested developers to get into the WPF space more quickly. The added benefits for those that do is the ability to provide feedback on both the technology and the book, which is a great place to be."
4,Good book to get advantage,"Some times when you need to get advantage in you code of technologies that will be coming soon, you must read a heterogeneous sources of information each one of them partial. This is a book to join them together. This is my first reference book in WPF. This is what you need if you want to be a high technology programmer this is your book."
5,Must Have At This Point,"If you are interested in Avalon (WPF) at all, then this is the book you need! It is by far the best book on the subject that's currently available. Sure, this is still beta technology and by now a few new builds have been made available, but updated samples are available online.Not only will the technology change before it is released, but there will also be a lot of new tools available by the time it ships. For the time being however, this book tells you how things are done without special tools. And it can never hurt to know how things are done under the hood.Long story short: If you are interested in Avalon, buy this book!"
2,Very Out Of Date,"While Avalon aka Windows Presentation Framework is still in beta, I had hoped that the code examples and references in this book would not be far out of date. I am finding that they are dramatically out of date (writing this review 04/27/2006). This is not to criticize the quality of the book or of the content; it appears to be well written. However, it was written in September 2005, and there has been at least 3 new beta releases of the framework since then. About 1/2 of the examples I have tried will not even compile, or have bad runtime errors.The ""big concepts"" are mostly unchanged. However, I cannot recommend this book to anyone. Programmer to programmer, you will be better off reading examples from online sources like msdn.microsoft.com and downloading new WPF tools like ""Expression"". This book will find you confused with broken examples fast. I look forward to an updated version when Avalon solidifies."
3,Good overview but details must be obtained elsewhere,"A person learning C# programming like me needs a method to gather user input and show results to users; WPF is the obvious choice. This book provides a good overview of WPF and gets you started programming it. However, you will still have to make frequent reference to the Microsoft library documentation for details of the various classes. Also, many of the examples are advanced and presume you are just adding on WPF knowledge to a strong .NET probramming background. This makes the book of limited value to beginners."
1,Not Recommended,"I bought this book with great expectations, but was disappointed. After spending several months trying to become somewhat familiar with WPF, I thought I was ready to delve into the details. So, I purchased ""Programming WPF."" Sorry to say, I couldn't understand much of what the authors had to say.If you already have a good understanding of WPF, you can probably learn more from the book. Don't expect this book to help you much if you are relatively new to WPF.This book suffers from three common problems. The index doesn't relate well to the content. The book lacks a glossary of terms. The book was apparently reviewed by a technical editor who focused only on accuracy; it should also have been reviewed by an editor who focused on how well the text might be understood by learners.People who already know WPF well might learn much from this book. It's not a book for people who are not already experienced."
3,Not Hard Enough,"The story starts promisingly enough, with Lorna returning to her home after her mother dies to sell the family home which she and her siblings agree they can't keep. Instead, a dead body is discovered, which dredges up her memories of a friend who disappeared, because it's the brother's body which has been found. More bodies are unearthed, which promises an intriguing mystery, especially after she hires hunky PI T.J. to investigate.Sadly, the story fizzles out after that. Especially after Lorna is joined by her friend Regan and her romantic interest Mitch. It becomes more Nancy Drew-ish rather than a hard-hitting thriller. Romance is hinted at but is so restrained it becomes boring. The story becomes simplistic and the conclusion is unconvincing. Disappointing considering that I really enjoyed Mariah Stewart's previous trilogy -- Dead Certain, Dead Wrong, Dead Even, which was more hard hitting and less amateurish."
3,Another Horizon clone,"Universal - for reasons best known to themselves, and not a million miles away from $$$ - chose to licence ""Horizon"" clones around the world; they are not lifted from the vinyl as ""expert"" guesses, but are early digital versions, rather than the ""remastered"" versions we hear now.For the most part, there's little difference - but every time they are remastered, Karen's voice is reduced, and Richard's arrangements are enhanced - so one day, these will be a collector's item.But for now, just for the ""I must have everything"" collector - like me!"
1,Not at all as shown,"The description shows CD inserts for standard jewel cases, but what was shipped were inserts for slim jewel cases, which won't work in standard jewel cases. Blue Proton has yet to respond to my email seeking an explanation - two weeks later. Good thing Amazon handled the order so my refund was quick and simple."
4,a curious man,"This is a well-researched and charmingly written book about a curious character from the last century. Actually, Lincoln was born in the 19th century but spent most of his life in the 20th.While the subject of the book is himself not charming, a sociopath actually, the author is a pleasure to encounter. He is honest and has a dry humour that makes the book both interesting and enjoyable. If you are interested in the period, you might also read Reilly, Ace of Spies and books by or about spymaster Bruce Lockheart."
5,Worked great,"Used this to make sugar cookies and covered those in fondant. Nice and sturdy, durable and easy to wash clean."
5,Good for cut-out cookies and sandwiches,"We have used this to make cut-out sugar cookies for a four year old birthday party and to cut out shapes for PB&J sandwiches. Our kids love both and it is easy to use. In fact, it is just about perfect for the average sized slice of bread."
3,Smaller than realized,I needed a sandwich cutter and thought this would work. It's much smaller in size than I imagined. It would be good for a cookie cutter as described. The item shipped promptly.
3,Good idea,"These are cute, but the cookie dough spreads so you can hardly tell what it's supposed to be. Also the dough sticks to the wing tips, making it hard to get clear lines for the cookies (I did refrigerate the dough first so it wouldn't be too soft as well). I wish the wing tips weren't so narrow, I would use it more often!"
1,Airlplane Cookie Cutter,I bought this item for my sister who was making some airplane cookies for a soldier returning from Iraq. After she cut out the first cookie the cutter broke at one of the welds. What a dissapointment. I will not buy from this vendor again. Cheaply made do not recommend this product to anyone.
4,A Christmas CLASSIC!,"This has always been a Christmas favorite in my family. My mom had a huge collection of albums (yep, ALBUMS!) so as a kid I learned to love many types of music for what each offered. This Temptations X-mas album has a soulful groove from beginning to end. From the opening vocals of 'Rudolph' to the end of the album, where the Temtations wish us all a merry X-mas in harmony. The song 'Someday at Christmas' will give you goosebumps, listen to it and relate it to recent world events. I only rated it 4 out of 5 stars because I wish it had more tracks. I'll listen to this album all year, but come X-mas, it never leaves the CD changer."
5,My Favorite Holiday Album Ever!,"Hands down my favorite Christmas album! A must-have for Temptations and classic Motown fans. It's Christmas Day and I'm groovin' to the Temps right now. No other compilation that I own comes close to the perfection of this album. The price is right, so you must buy!"
4,CRACKED CASE,"The CD arrived in a cracked case. The CD was fine, but should have been packaged better than in an envelope."
3,good machine Better Service!,"got the sprayer for small size jobs/ patio/ parrot cages/ etc. First time we plugged it in it stopped working in about 15 minutes. packed it back up, got on-line with Truely Awsome Amazon dot com. the next day UPS came and got the sprayer, the day after that UPS came with a new sprayer that WORKS FINE!.thank you Amazon!"
4,Works well for what we are using it for...,"We did not need a high pressure, pressure washer. The product work well and meets our needs. If you are looking to use it for heavy duty projects, I'd suggest getting a different model."
1,Junk review- read before you buy.,"When I received the box from UPS I was surprised that the washer was shipped in the box from Black and Decker and without any other box to protect the shippment from Amazon. My washer looked fine but when I put it together nothing worked. The motor would not start. I noticed that the ""ON"" button was broken and then pieces just fell out after the button fell off! So would this have happened if better shipping packing had occured - I do not know. But I asked for a refund. It took to long and was to much work trying to get the darn thing back in the box."
1,BUYER BEWARE BAD ITEM,"I have bought two of these items in the last 2 years for my auto detailing business. The first one caught fire after 9 months of usage. I returned the charred washer back to the store. Get this, they tried to give me a busted up new replacement. I said ""NO!!"" and got a perfect new one. This second one desinigrated around the water connection areas after 6 months. The pump cutoff also malfuntioned on both units, causing it to always run or pulsate. Then the connections just broke off and the whole unit is now worthless. Yes, these are cheap pumps as electric washers go, but it should last a little longer than 6-9 months for $100+. I highly recommend that you DO NOT BUY this pressure washer. Also, weak pressure, only 1,000PSI."
1,bad christmas,my husband receive this item for christmas 2004 and he only used it once and the motor quit working and the off and on button came off. He has tried several times to contact this company and no one will answer the phone. They say each call is important but they sure don't act as if it is . This item should be taken off the market.
3,Exactly what I wanted,"An easy-to-store, capable power washer for small jobs around the house. I used this washer the evening I received it to power wash the mold from between bricks in my paver patio, and to clean up some patio wood furniture. It worked fabulously-- no issues. It also scrubbed algae and stains from the patio bricks with ease. I am very pleased. It set up quickly, no messing around with gasoline. Just connect the hoses, plug in the washer, and go. It is the best 90 bucks I have spent in a while.October 2011, five years after purchase: the high pressure hose deteriorated, and multiple leaks began to spew small streams of water, basically all at once. I presume the hose material does not age well. Sadly, the hose alone (according to black and decker) costs nearly as much as the entire unit did originally. Therefore, this unit lasted me possibly seven or eight usages over the years. I might have been better off with a different unit."
1,"Bad investment, flawed design.","I bought the Black&Decker pressure washer for my husband, my brother also bought one from Walmart. After the first 3 uses it began to leak because it was under warranty we returned it for another. The second one completely fell apart. My bothers washer met the same fate. Buyer beware this pressure washer is a waste of money."
3,B&D 1050 PSI Electric Pressure Washer,Its good for light jobs. I use it to assist in washing my motor home. This was bought from Amazon.com
1,Pathetic Product,"I bought two of these washers: one for myself, one for my adult son. Mine worked fair for a couple of times, then it just quit.....wouldn't do anything. When I say fair I mean the connection to the hose leaked from the start. Borrowed my son's, which had worked several times. Again, washing just fine, I turned it off and it never would work again. We both have read and re-read the instructions, followed them perfectly....Please, public: read these reviews and do not buy this product."
2,Black and Decker poor job,This product should be a good one with either 4 or 5 stars but it has a major draw back at the port of water in. At that port it is ease to break down. I think that I see this defect in another review but I just ignored it.
5,this is what michael really meant to say...,"hello my name is michael and what i forgot to tell everyone is that im a teenybopper poser that likes boy bands and built a shrine to them. thats why i do not like real music. im a loser and im pathetic, but everyone else that gave this music good review is not. ill go back to listening to backdoor boys while the rest of these people listen to some real music."
1,Spider-Man...tough!,"Spider-Man has become popular, (coming with the highly awaited Spider-Man 2) but not this game. The buttons are easy to remember, but the levels are hard. The worst part is, you have one life through the whole game! I only got to level 3 till I died. I can only say that Spider-Man is for gamers who like a challenge."
5,Book is a fascinating history of the Nelson family.,"Book is currently out of print, but is unquestionably worth finding a copy. A truly remarkable family in every way. Ozzie led a very interesting life, and Harriet was an accomplished lady of her own. Would love for someone to write an update on the remaining Nelsons. We lost a genius with Ozzie's passing in '75 and you owe it to yourself to read his autobiography"
4,Interesting perspective.,"Ozzie wrote this, so you have to take it as how he wanted everyone to see his family.Kristin Nelson (Tinker) wrote a book that was closer to what was really going on."
1,"Oh my,,,,Ozzie was smart but boring!!!!","I searched and searched for this book, because I had read some good reviews. What a waste of time. I think Ozzie was smart,,,,but oh my, this is the most boring book I have ever read. Ozzie has an entire chapter telling about playing football.If you have always liked the Nelson family,,,don't read this book,,,you might end up hating Ozzie for writing it."
1,falls apart in a couple months,poor quality - the lids fall apart fast - if you don't mind not having the lid I guess it is okay
3,OK for light duty only,I owned this wrench for over a year. And it just broke! Lower jaw broke off! It was OK for light duty work but adjustment is somewhat cumbersome.
1,pos,"largest mistake for a purchase first time i used it i split my hand wide open because it slips. round, or square it slips. i enjoy all my other irwin tools but this one i could care less for. the only reason i keep it is to watch the new kids grab it from my bag and bust their hand. i know its twisted but you gotta do what you can to make some days go by."
3,It's ok. Don't buy this for commercial use.,"The jaws slip too easily. The quick adjustment feature is a nice thought, but it just doesn't give you the tight grip you need for tough industrial use. I constantly ended up defaulting back to a standard pipe wrench. Disappointing.I give it three stars only because it is still in my tool bag, and does get used occasionally- but only for small, quick jobs. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Won't get near,"My cat won't give these a second look, so they were tossed. Nothing else to say, just adding words for minimum word count, jeesh."
1,My cats were uninterested,"Usually my cats would be very appreciative of treats, dental or not. These did nothing for them, wrapped or unwrapped. They were batted around a few minutes then ignored. No dental cleaning took place. Not worth it."
5,"Petrodex Cat Dental Treats, 50ct",Great stuff.Nothing equals this product for feline dental health.Excellent treat and easily digestible.Too bad this product is not available in my area.My cat loves it!
3,How I got my cat to try this...,"Time will tell how well this works on Bubba's teeth. Just thought I'd share how I got him to eat them, since he wouldn't at first try.He ignored it when it was whole. So I cut it in half, and then dribbled a teeny bit of tuna fish on it. Then I left the room. When I came back, he ate the whole thing.Next day, I cut it in half and just smeared a teensy bit of his canned food on it. Then I left the room. When I came back he again had eaten the whole thing.So, you might try this method if you didn't have luck at first. I really want him to munch on these, 'cause I've heard good things about what they can do for his 9 year old teeth.I'm gonna continue with this, gradually cutting out the ""treats"" smeared on top. And then if I can get him to eat it cut in half, I'll eventually try to get him to eat it whole."
4,One likes it one don't.,"My female cat which weighs 8 pounds would eat the whole bag in one sitting, the male who weighs 10 likes one and walks away. Cats, go figure. I found that the male loves the Greenies though so I've got both covered. The only thing I can say is buy a pack and see if your cat will like them, no other way to know. I put in the cats weights as this crops up in other reviews."
3,"IF they work, I'll continue with them","I'm going to have to disagree with the previous review of this product. They obviously have a large cat?? These treats are actually a bit too big for my Persians and I have to squash them so that the cats can get their teeth into them instead of just rolling them around and losing them. I would actually rate this product much higher except for several things. I rate it high because my cats ALL love them (8 cats), I rate it high on ingredients because it's very difficult to find cat treats that aren't just dry food in disguise complete with corn and wheat ingredients, and lastly, I would LOVE to rate these for effectiveness in keeping the teeth clean, but I just don't know if they work worth a darn... it's too early to tell. The product does not get top rating from me because of the high price for low quantity and for the difficulty my cats have in eating them without my intervention."
1,My cat was not impressed,"My cat refused these after one lick. I don't know if it was because of the smell or the texture. They are long(kind of shaped like a vienna sausage) and very light, lots of air.When put in his food dish, he just ate around it and would not even acknowledge it. I think my cat prefers a little bit heftier or chewier of treat.[...] Thanks!"
4,small cat chews this well,"I have a small cat(8.9lbs)who we adopted through a shelter. She had very little history other than her approximate age and came to us gulping her food, not chewing. Although she has been a delightful cat for over a year she still does not chew her food so we decided to try something bigger to force her to chew. The dental treats disappear and her tarter is under control. We have found no problems with the size of the bits and in fact I think they are doing a marvelous job."
2,"Won't eat, Not effective",Our cats wouldn't eat these. They would lick the treats but weren't willing to actually consume them. The treats were flaky also. How can a dental treat even work if the animals won't touch it?
3,"Too small for my ""Korat mix"" cat","Being that the enzymes are on the outside of the treat my crazy cat doesn't get the benefit of it because she doesn't chew it. In fact...she rarely chews any of her food.So...I've switched to another brand on Amazon, which is much larger in size, in the hopes that she'll HAVE TO chew it.I'll give my review once I receive the new product and see how it works."
2,Won't buy again.,"One of my kittens (both under a year old) likes this dental treat kind of, my other kitten won't eat it. I honestly don't know how Petrodex works but it's a pain to take off the paper wrapping from each piece and then crumbling it so my kittens can eat it. I won't be purchasing again."
2,missing important item,I have used this condordance 3 to 4 times since purchasing it a month ago. Today I looked up bless and found no entry for bless or any form of this word. How could this word be left out of a comprehensive concordance. This word can be found in any Bible concordance. The word does appear in The Message so it should be included in the concordance I purchased.
2,Concise Concordance: Emphasis on CONCISE,"This may be the only concordance for the Message Bible, but that by no means is a reason to buy it. Lately I have been looking for the verse which has the phrase ""A no on Earth is a no in heaven, and a yes on earth is a yes in heaven."" This concordance doesn't have a single one of those words. If you have the internet, there is no reason WHATSOEVER to buy this book. It is much easier to use Bible.com for finding words and phrases in the Message. I gave this concordance 2 stars not 1, b/c we all have times when we are away from the computer and need a concordance. And while this concordance lacks many words, it does have 416 pages of words, synonyms, and phrases. I would suggest that you buy an exhaustive concordance if you are serious about Bible study. Or you could just use [...] (previously referenced) or [...]"
5,The best Cappuccino I have ever had!,"This stuf taste exactely like the one you get at your local Starbucks.. I had this product on autoship from coock.com, the pods tasted so good I finished all 24 of them in a couple of weeks and had to order more. Easy to make no mess no measuring.Highly recommended."
3,challenging to use,These pods are not easy to use nor are they explained in the description. I thought I was getting pods formy Senseo 1 cup serving coffee machine because the picture looked like the same thing but the coffeewas packed too hard. I then tried it in my expresso machine and I just got tea colored water. I finally hadto get my sissors and put the loose coffee in my teapot's filter. The coffee however was aromatic even though theexpiration date is a month away.
5,My babies LOVE this book,"We got this book from the library, but I had to buy my own copy of it. My twin baby boys love it. They are only 5 1/2 months old and this is the first book I've read to them that they are very interested in. I make the ""Boo Hoo Hoo"" and ""Trek Trek Trek"" sounds to them all the time and they smile and laugh. Highly recommend as one of the first books to read to a baby, and probably through toddler age."
3,I just don't get it,"I love the illsutrations. I love all the cross-hatching and the YAK placidly chewing. I love all the action on every page. I love all of that.But reading this book out loud to my family of boys -- I just don't get it. I can't seem to find the rhythm of the story. My kids liked saying ""Boo Hoo Hoo,"" of course... but that's not enough to save the story."
3,Ticonderoga Pencils,"The pencils are great quality, just bought them for pencil fighting. I thought they would have been a stronger pencil. I am sure they would be great for intended purpose. :)"
1,SPLASH VOLLEY BALL,THIS TOY IS POORLY CONSTRUCTED AND OFF BALANCE.THE CHILDREN HAVE TO KEEP ADJUSTING THE ROPES.THEY DON'T FEEL IT WAS WORTH PUTTING IN THE POOL AND NEVER USE IT ANYMORE.IT WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY AS THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT FROM THE FIRST DAY.IF YOU CAN JUSTIFY THE COST OF TOY PLUS SHIPPING COST YOU WILL KEEP ME AS A FUTURE CUSTOMER.I LIKE TO BUY TOYS THAT THEY ENJOY AS I AM THE DOTING GRANDMOTHER.THAT ONE WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY
5,Loved it!,"Night of the Creeps was a fun and campy movie. Containing - aliens, zombies, slugs and co-eds, what more could you ask for?"
5,"About Damn Time Sony, Thrill Me!!!","I must say, Night of the Creeps is one of those films that has stayed with me since childhood. From the snappy in-jokes, to the awesome one-liners, this film has been longing for a dvd release. Tom Atkins performance alone is enough to buy this film.This fall I am in retro-horror heaven( or hell?) with the release of ""Night of the Creeps"" as well as the original ""The Stepfather"", ""The Gate"", ""Hardware"", ""Happy Birthday to Me"", ""House on Sorority Row"", ""Phantasm 2"", all receiving the special edition dvd treatment! Now if only Sony would release a Special Edition ""Fright Night""!"
1,not a cult classic,but you're being told it is. this is a terrible movie and i question the credibility of anyone awarding 3+ stars.
4,"Great film, new ending!","Nights of the Creeps has always been, and always will be one of my favorite films. B movie to the max! Sure the case for the film sucks and looks like a current teen film, but nothing our printers cant fix!I was shocked to see that the original ending (theatrical) was cut from the film! I understand the Directors reasoning and was happy they included it as a extra feature, but this wasnt the version I grew up on. If the BluRay gave a option on wich version to watch, that would have been better, but hey its Night of the Creeps on Bluray now....The special features are flawless and really in depth.Film - 5 starsNew ending - 4 stars (Still excellent but just not what we're use to)Special Features - 5 starsCase - 2 stars"
4,awesome,"dvd has a few smudges n scratches but im sure it will play fine since blu ray are really hard to damage unless its cracked! a+ , on time fast delivery, ty"
5,Classic 80's horror!,"This is one of those ""creature turns them in zombies"" zombie movies. I saw it in the theaters when it first came out and I still love it! Laughs, thrills and chills!"
3,ok,"this is a good ""B"" movie. Nothing to write home about. I ordered new but it was an obvious return- opened and rewrapped."
5,The true stories of Japan's kamikaze corps survivors,"Blossoms In The Wind: Human Legacies Of The Kamikaze presents the true stories of Japan's kamikaze corps survivors - pilots who were slated to sacrifice their lives in battle during World War II, but who survived through chance or fate. Now after the September 11th attacks, in an era when suicide attacks are becoming an increasingly serious threat in the present, Blossoms In The Wind explores what can bind a human heart and soul to commit to the ultimate sacrifice, as well as the bonds of brotherhood that remain between fellow warriors after sixty years of peace. A profound and directly relevant testimony, often directly recounting the survivors' perspectives in their own words."
2,Kept Woman,"After reading this book what is clear is that Judy Nelson was basically a kept woman. The rich and famous can afford to do that...so long as they are rich and famous and their fragile egos are intact. And why is Nelson complaining? For 6 years she had an intimate relationship with a celebrity and lived a lavish lifestyle. But like many relationships it came to a abrupt end when Navratilova simply moved on to another girlfriend. That's life Nelson and it happens every day. Poetic justice for Nelson, who cheated on her husband Ed. Navratilova had an extended fling with Nelson and Nelson thought it was love."
1,Soulless dribble,"If Faulkner/Nelson team isn't embarrassed by this collaboration they must be members of the walking dead. Shameful, hoohah about nothing. Absolutely purposeless. At .01 it is over priced. I found my copy at the local library discard bin... now I know why. The genuinely talented Rita Mae Brown did herself a huge disservice letting her name appear on the cover. It only served to make her own self indulgent Martina catharsis ""Sudden Death"" seem like a mercy killing by associating her name with this garbage."
3,It was ok!!,"The book was in fair condition, no highlights, rips or tears, stains was shipped very quickly and at a very affordable price... the stand was not so good but for the price it was a nice buy!!!"
4,Puzzling realities,"David Wells' Book of curious & interesting Puzzles is an outstanding collection of all kinds of puzzles, arithmetic, visual, plain intelligent etc. The book is interesting, because it tells you the history of a particular puzzle, beginning with the oldest ever, found at Luxor, Egypt, in 1650 BC.You can use these puzzles in a math class, but also to solve them together with friends or collegues. I bought it to help me find a solution for picturing a four dimensional object. Everyone should have it at home for his or her children or visitors.It's great fun."
2,lesser Limits,"This is one of the poorer episodes in the series. The claim that it is one of the most unsettling is probably due to the ""attachment"" procedure that the title creatures use to enter the bodies of their human hosts. It reminded me of the way John Hurt was ""hosted"" in the film Alien. However having this procedure didn't seem to change the behaviour of Don Gordon who behaves the same way before and after. Perhaps the way it effected George MacReady and Neil Hamilton (later to appear in TV's Batman) was to make them act over-the-top. This is particularly unsettling for MacReady, who's voice is in opposition to this kind of performance. (Who can forget him in Gilda with Rita Hayworth). His teeth are also noticeably odd here. Was he wearing dentures? There is also a surprising homoerotic subtext to this episode which I'm sure is unintentional."
3,One new episode doesn't quailfy for a new tape,Snow is the only new episode one this video. It talked about a time where Skarloey got stuck in a snowstorm. The other two Christmas episodes are good but they sre on Thomas's Christmas Party. Also one of the episodes is really Thomas and Percy's Mountain Aventure not Christmas adventure considering it's about Thankgiving. Special Funnel is only on this one because there's snow on the ground in it. Terence the Tractor was in the first tape and it also was on just because snow was on the ground in it. I was very disappointed with this tape and if I were you I would just buy Thomas's Snowy Suprise.
3,You don't really need it,"This, I believe, was the second holiday Thomas release. At the time it was a great video but now, you don't need it. It only had 1 new story, Snow, where Rusty tells Thomas the story of Skarloey and the worst winter of all. It also has a new music video entitled ""The Snow Song"" which was good and now, that is pretty much the only reason to purchase this video. So this video wasn't all that exciting when it came out since it only has one new story. I've said this once and I'm gonna say it again, if you want a good holiday video, buy Thomas' Snowy Surprise."
4,"my son would give this 5 stars, but i give it 4.","i give this video 4 stars only because of alec baldwin's vocalizations for james (i wrote about this in my thomas the tank engine ""make someone happy"" review)--it is distracting in this video, versus inappropriate in the other. the snow song is wonderful; really this is a delightful christmas or holiday time video. my son absolutely loves it."
2,Barry White disappoints,I love Barry White! I couldn't wait to get home to play this CD. Unfortunately it seems heavy handed in the treble end and loses those deep tones one looks for. The essential sound of the Dr. of Love is there in those low spoken introductions. Mix of the great hits of the 70's plus more recent songs. Improves with the right company and the lights down LOW........
5,The Ultimate = Barry White,"I had never heard Barry White until we Netflick'd Ally McBeal.They had so much fun with Barry White, I wanted a CD.This was it! GREAT!!!"
4,Only One,This set provides a complete selection of BW. Unfortunately the audio quality is lacking. Needs to be remastered.
2,Whirlpool dehumidifier unreliability.,"I have purchased four of these and the first one was excellent. One had an electrical problem while it was plugged in that could have caused a fire. Fortunately I was home and the odor alerted me. The third one did not work at all and was returned to where I purchased it for a refund. The fourth one will not work because the bucket will not engage to the point where it will operate. I have a book propped against it to keep the bucket in place. Needless to say, I am looking into another brand to supplement my oldest one which is still working after 5 years."
2,Effective but Problematic,"This unit was very effective at removing moisture when it worked! We had 2 of them. The first one only lasted 6 mos before it froze and wouldn't work. The store replaced it and then 8 months later Whirlpool recalled the second one to have a fire hazard in the wireing repaired. After that it lasted another year and a half. The compressor kicks on but the fan is dead. We are going to replace it with another model because even when it worked it was loud, the water bucket was hard to clean, and the filter was inadequate in design for people like us that have dog hair in the air."
2,So expensive to operate,"Our electric bill doubled when we started using this thing. Does it suck the water out of the air? Yes. But there's GOT to be a more cost effective unit. If I was in the market again, I'd buy a more expensive and energy efficient dehumidifier."
5,So desperately needed on NEW AGE TECHNOLOGY!,"I luv this item!!! I had the cassette, but have lost it over the years. I so wish this would be issued on CD for all to enjoy. Bring back the classics!"
2,"A recitation of history, with no analysis","While many who are reading this review are probably interested in the website story, this book is probably not the one to read. The author did not have access to Jeff Bezos and many other key players when writing this book, and the lack of first hand information shows.It reads like a detailed, outsiders view of the history of the company. This happened, then that happened, then the site did this other thing. There is very little discussion of *why* these events and actions were important. And most importantly, very little context as to how the site changed the face of internet commerce.This book is certainly not the definitive work on [site], which is still to be written. A better (and funnier) look at the internals of Amazon can be found in ""21 Dog years - Doing time at Amazon.com""."
4,Fascinating Story,"This book really conveys the drama of the creation and building of Amazon.com by Jeff Bezos. Its really a biography of Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, through about 1999, ending before the .com crash.There are a couple parts where the story drags, but generally, there was much more drama and interest than I expected. The story is skillfully told and the writing is clear, and after reading this book, I intend to look for the others that this author, Robert Spector, has written.I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to track the rise of Amazon.com. It was published too soon to provide the author with the opportunity to analyze the aftermath of the fantasticly overheated internet marketplace that led to the dot.com bust, but you can see how he examines all the elements from the perspective of 1999. Spector doesn't forecast the fall, but you can see all the excess and unmistakable signs of what is to come. I would love to see a Second Edition."
4,"Good book, needs updating again","This book does a great job at telling the Amazon.com story. Nice to hear that an entrepreneur actually planned their business and didn't just get lucky.Now that we've hit 2005, it would be great to get another update (the current final chapter is a bit of an update from couple of years ago). What is the story behind their profit? Stock? The door desks?Overall....a good, quick read."
4,Amazon on Amazon,"I love the book. Though not bought at amazon. :< The story of how a not known internet company to a successful and real big one. How the company relied on open source and slowly as it get bigger used more commercial software. It describe how a man vision can come true by believing. Truly amazing book, I like one part of the book which says 'How do Amazon review this book for themselve?'. It's a good read"
3,The story of Amazon,"I love Amazon.. both to shop and to analyze, but I found this book to be a little slow. Regardless, Jeff Bezos is someone to stand in awe of. I wish my mind were that sharp."
3,Where are the tracks?,"The last grammy rap nominee was decent and i've been waiting to see who's on this cd but when i went to ""buying"" info it didn't say what songs where on it"
4,Not for curly hair,"I have unruly curly hair and finally decided to splurge on a nice hairdryer. It works pretty well, and my hair seems healthy, but it was not the ""super dryer"" I was expecting.Cons: heavy, DOES NOT HAVE DIFFUSER for curly hair, cheap design (the air filter seems flimsy and I have seen some people taping the filter on for stability).Pros: doesn't dry out hair cuticle (still waiting for proof), extra long cord.I haven't owned many hairdryers, but I don't think the price was worth the product."
4,pretty good for the price,"I had been looking for the song ""Oh Bondage up Yours"" by xray spex ever since hearing it on an online radio station. It isn't in any of the usual record shops around my way. But while browsing through the punk compilations in my cool downtown shop, I found this US vs UK cd. First off I probably would of put the album version of the Pistols ""Anarchy"" song on the collection. The version on this cd is a demo; and while it is low production and supposed to be cool, it sounds like hell. But the rest contains some surprises that I haven't heard before like The Undertones and Suicidal Tendencies. Plus it has ""Oh Bondage"" which kicks major A#@.It doen't have the Clash--- so what, they are overrated. If you like rock and punk get this."
1,What a terrible idea,This has got to be the worst idea for a compilation ever. What a bunch of garbage. Plase just buy the original artist's albums.And apparently The Clash were never punk since they aren't on this compilation.
4,A real page turner...,"Make sure you have time to read, when you start this book, because you won't want to put it down. IT's easy to get so caught up in this book that you will just want to finish it."
4,Liked,Enough twists and turns to keep it interesting and enough action to keep one's attention. Ready to start the next Angel book!!
5,Very Good Book,Couldn't put it down at the end. Went an got book 2 and 3 from library to read. Great series.
3,Recommend,"Angel is a modern day Job. Life starts going wrong and continues to get worse but it gives her an opportunity to reassess, resolve and get stronger. I like the story and enjoy the characters. The one annoying part is that everyone is so very beautiful. I got the image of the story being acted out by a cast of Ken and Barbies. It is a Christian mystery so if you are bothered by that, be aware that it is but I did not feel that the mentions of faith were a distraction from the story. Rather, it was handled as a normal person would incorporate their faith into their daily life.This is not a book that so excites me I go out and buy copies for my friends and it is not a book that I would throw away and tell everyone to avoid. It is a good mystery and I enjoyed it and if you are looking for a light read, Christian mystery, I recommend this."
3,Deadly Aim,"I was entertained but there is nothing noteworthy about the book - simple detective story, simply written. Maybe the book #2 continuation might generate more recognition interest."
2,I thought I'd try a new-to-me author,"I was disappointed in how it was written. The story, itself, was good, but I kept getting the feeling that the author was trying to get in every ploy she could think of to hook us. Not only was this overdone, but it was done in an elementary way. I always knew where she was headed before she got there so the ONLY mystery was who-done-it--not enough to have me try another book from this author."
5,I love You Patricia Rushford,"Finally a book that has all the action, just enough of love, and not all the trash talk. Love how there is just enough love between Angel, and Callen to show that Cops still have a life, but yet they were not all over each other, and didnt have to read through all the drama. I love this series and wish they were more books to read of this series. Just enough detail but not enough to bore you to death."
1,"No, thanks.","I will preface this review by stating that I did not finish this book. I tolerated about a third of it before deciding I'd had quite enough. I felt like I was reading a young adult novel. The writing style was overly simplistic and the storyline was predictable. If you're into that, enjoy! Not for me."
1,Poorly written oddity,"As another reviewer said, Amazon probably had difficulty categorizing this one, with its religion + mystery + romance aspects. However, a bigger issue is that it is poorly written. The romance was contrived. The police protocol wasn't credible. I skipped over much of the final third of the book to get to the wrapup of the various subplots. I wouldn't recommend this book, and find it very hard to believe it has gotten 4 out of 5 stars. I don't usually try unknown books unless they get 4/5 stars and haven't been very disappointed, despite a few less-than-stellar reads. Again, I would not recommend this book and I hope enough reviewers rate if fairly (e.g. at most 2/5) to lower that misleading rating."
3,Deadly Aim,Great story line to keep you interested. Well paced to keep you from getting confused or bored. I like the author and the book.
4,Good read,It was a good read! It flowed fast and left you wanting more. Would definitely read more in the serires.
3,Deadly Aim,"Was okay, I read it all but was not really that interested. Would not recommend it as a page turner."
3,"Entertaining, but predictable.","You should know that this is two different stories.First, it's a police story, and a good one too.Then it's a love story, a chick story, and for me, eh.But, I stuck with it, well written, all the usual suspects, and she finds love in the end, or does she?The price was right. I need more action, less ""Our eyes met, I had to look away for fear I'd throw myself into his powerful arms.........""You choose."
2,Dragged along,"Frankly, I find the average rating of 4 stars for this book befuddling.I made it through over 100 pages, but the story of Deadly Aim dragged so much that at page 127, I skipped to the last chapter to be done with it. At one point, the main character was eating a cheeseburger that was described in such detail that I felt like saying, ""Enough already!""It's not a bad book, but it couldn't keep my attention. Maybe if some humor had been thrown in, I would have finished it & given it 3 stars."
3,Deadly Aim...Deadly Good,"The murder of a young mand at the docks and a an officer involved shooting. Are they connected? Deadly Aim, set in Oregon, is a good read on a cloudy rainy weekend. I was captivated from the beginning, keeping my attention and wondering how this would end. I pride myself in trying to figure out the ""who"" in the done it, and thought I was given little hints, but the ending was a suprise to me and that is always the sign of a good mystery.I enjoyed this book. The characters were developed enough so that you could understand why they would make certain choices. And while the main character did get on my nerve jumping to conclusions and making wrong assumptions, I enjoyed her energy and ""spunk"". I would recommend this book with 3 1/2 stars. A good read."
2,"Good Story, yet often awkwardly written",I really cared about the characters and the story was well constructed. I found the author's sermonizing off putting and there was absolutely no need for all the religious references.
2,Boring,As I sit here trying to remember this book - I can't ! That should tell you all you need to know. My only memory was forcing myself to finish the story and not being particularly invested in any of it.
2,Mystery and romance in the NW,"OK Angel was a little too spunky for my tastes. ""Who done it"" was pretty obvious early in the book."
4,Good mystery.,It was hard to put down. Was surprised by the ending. There were several people that were implicated in different parts of the story.
4,Quick read,"Really liked this book & look forward to reading more by this author! On occasion, I could almost predict what was going to happen....but not always."
4,Deadly Aim,The Author made the book interesting from page one which I like.I'm looking forward to reading the next Angel Delaney Books.
4,Great Story,The story was entertaining and did not have a lot of things that had nothing to do with the story.
2,Doesn't ring true,"The book doesn't ring true,its characters didn't act like normal people. And it didn't take me long to figure out why...it's a novel whose aim is to preach a religious message. I tried to continue, but it became increasingly boring. Great literature, it ain't. And if you think a Christian message cannot be great literature at the same time, you haven't read the Chronicles of Narnia! At least that series isn't heavy-handed propaganda!"
5,Deadly aim,Was terrific loved itWant to read more of her books and I will Was very well written and would highly recommend it. Deadly aim is fantastic
4,Best (maybe 2nd best) Mystery book! :),"I reallyyy loved this book, but there was only one bad thing about it. 65-70% of the book was predictable. I would recommend this to people who enjoy mystery and action."
3,First Read,"Downloaded this because it was there and wanted to use my new shiny Christmas Kindle. Read it to the end because wanted to find out 'who did it' but a little too preachy and a little too angsty for my taste, nice little romance brewing there but don't think I would read further books in the series."
3,Twists and turns,Lots of back stories mixed in with the main - some what predictable at the end. Good easy read. Likeable the family involved
4,Great book!!,A little slow at times but keep reading it gets good. Had me wondering who the bad guy was the whole time.
4,Interesting,I had a hard time getting into the book but stuck with it and it got better. Lots of suspense.
3,Angel is a very good officer of the law,This was a very good mystery. The plot was believable. The romance was very nice. The sense of family the best. This book comes highly recommended to mystery lovers.
4,A quick read,It only took me a couple of hours to read and that was what I was looking for. It kept me interested and there was just enough mystery that you can't figure it out to early although when I finished I realized where the foreshadowing was. It was very good.
3,"Quick, Good Read",A fun book for my new Kindle. Just what I needed and wanted. A good read. Kept my attention. Great for traveling!
4,A good read,"I chose this book because I love detective stories, cop dramas and murder mysteries. It did not disappoint me and was a good read right through to the end."
5,Excellent!,At first I thought it was going to be ho hum. But it picked up. I could very much imagine this a true story.
3,Not so great,"I didn't have any 5 star expectations from this book even with low expectations I was disappointed a bit. Don't get me wrong it has a decent plot, but the problem was sub plots. There were tons of sub plots touching different aspects like religion, cooking etc. I didn't understand author's obsession of explaining intricate details about people eating food, cooking etc. The book spends too much time dilly dallying upon these sub plots. Apart from that it has very decent plot, good mystery. Best part is it's free, catch it if you have some time to kill."
3,Mystery,"A good mystery yet somewhat predictable. The religious aspect got to be a bit much. The writing was good, an easy read."
4,Looking forward to reading the next one,"Great book! Several times I thought I had it figured out ""who done it,"" the author proves me wrong. And when I think that it can't get any worse, it does. I'd say more but I don't want to give away any of this excellent plot."
4,Good book,Surprising ending. It keeps you. GEUSSING who the bad guy is the whole time. Didn't so much like the issue with her dad.
5,What a book!,I told everyone I know how great this book was as I was reading it. I was so surprised again and again by the twists and turns of the happenings to Angel. It was hard to put down.
4,VERY GOOD START TO A SERIES,"DEADLY AIM is the first in the Angel Delaney Mysteries. In addition to the book description synopsis, I found this book to be well-written, interesting characters, packed with suspense and mystery. I look forward to reading more from this series collection."
5,"Muder, mystery and Romance","A quiet town experiences terrible crimes. A woman cop returns to her hometown to continue her career. As she tries to help others, bad things happen. Her strength through trials is inspiring"
5,awsome read,"i didnt expect much from this book at first because it was so inexpensive, I was very wrong. It was great, I found myself drawn to reading it ."
3,A romance novel in a mystery,"It's too bad. The first chapter set the stage for what should have been a mystery to be solved. However, what I got was a wimpy police officer with daddy issues. The main character kept whining about the lethal force she had to take and how she is never taken seriously as a police officer. I would have preferred an angry cop to this teary-eye sad-sack. Also, why was she always called by her first name rather than her last name like the other cops? And the instant magnetic attraction between the sissy cop and the lead investigator was so romance novel it was trite. Only the supporting cast and the surprise ending saved the book."
3,Not bad,Like the title says it wasn't a bad book. I read it all the way through and would consider reading any that follow. It was an easy read.
3,Not a thriller,Rather routine mystery. This is the first time I have read this author so perhaps other novels are better than this one.
3,Unbelievable,Did not like the preachy parts of the book and some of seemed too contrived. I also found her behavior as a police officer to be unbelievable at times.
2,Religious-Romance-Mystery?,"This must have been a tough book for Amazon to categorize, what with the religious overtones and sappy romance subplot. I expected more from this book, given the outstanding reviews and the author's pedigree. The plot was OK and if they had just stuck to it, it would have been much better for people like me who enjoy their mysteries/procedurals straight-up. If you enjoy books where God will find a way if only you believe or could have Fabio dressed as a detective returning the adoring gaze of a woman on the cover (as this one should have), then you'll probably like this one. Othewise, it'll probably disappoint. This book just had too many superfluous elements that I don't find interesting in a mystery. I won't be reading any other books in this series and I cannot recommend this one."
2,Boring and predictable,"The book is nothing more than a mixture of romance and religion with a smattering of pseudo suspense thrown in. The long drawn out discussions of cooking and relationships with mothers, fathers, brothers, and boyfriends/girlfriends were very tiring. I found myself skimming or skipping entire pages just to get to the end of the book. There is a reason it is a ""Free"" book - I would not recommend the book to any lovers of suspense, mystery, or detective style books."
4,Intriguing romance mystery,"Good writing full of romance, family, crime and murder. It was a slow read but it takes a lot to keep my interest and this did. Thumbs up! This was my first Rushford book I will probably check out more."
4,A good mystery,"I really enjoyed this novel. I fell in love with Angel and Callen early on and look forward to their relationship progressing in the subsequent books. The characters were likeable and admirable, especially Angel and Callen. The interplay between them hit just the right amount of romantic tension. I found myself personally relating to Angel's relationship with her father.The mystery was great - it kept me guessing with just the right amount of red herrings to make it interesting. I enjoyed the plot twists and turns as the characters had no choice but to roll with the punches.I know this was a good novel, because the characters and story line has stayed with me for a few days. The Christian element wasn't over the top, but I personally prefer more.Deadly Aim was well written and perfectly executed. I look forward to reading the series."
4,Deadly Aim,It was a page-turner. I would read more of her books. I enjoyed both the mystery and the spiritual aspects.
1,"Poor book, worse reviews","Wow! I'm reviewer number 3 on a book that is ranked around 1,144,000. The book is very slim on facts, but fat on fear. MSG fueld fear, no doubt.What I found really galling is that Mr. Steven Speizer, a previous reviewer, couldn't even write his own review, but lifted his comments from old emails that have been floating on the net for a couple of years.Mr. Erb is a typical eco-activist wannabe (an assistant to the assistant psychology professor) who can't take his desire for healthier foods into the marketplace but would rather employ the force of government to make others comply to his will. Fat people and unruly kids are due, not to corporate conspiricies, but to a ""victim"" mentality culture. ""It's always someoe elses fault. Let's sue!"""
4,Very nice for the price,"Although I only paid about $10 for this set of wineglasses, they are very attractive. (I needed some to replace a set from world market that basically cracked just by looking at them!) The large size is perfect and they have held up well over many months. They still sparkle and have not picked up any dishwasher dulling. I am not a glassware expert but I feel for the casual wine drinker who wants an oversized glass, these are just right for the price I paid."
3,Interesting!,"This book is on a subject near and dear to my heart, namely, classic TV homes. I always thought that if you had the money, it might be fun to build a Brady house, or a Bewitched love-nest. Or maybe even combine some classic TV architecture from several DIFFERENT shows into one house! A Dick Van Dyke sunken living room with a Bewitched kitchen and a Brady dining room!This book is not all that accurate, as other reviewers have stated, but if you're a fan and want a general idea of what the TV homes looked like, and want a few ideas for your own house-building project, this book isn't a bad start. And hey, it's FUN!Still, a revised edition with better measurements and so on would be much better."
3,Weird little book about classic TV sets,"People who had a misspent youth watching TV will love this book. It's all the classic old TV shows' blueprints. Not that a TV film crew could really maneuver in a real house. If they could, though, this book would show the floorplans. I love some of the surprise parts, like the Brady Bunch house or the Gilligan's Island outlying areas. It made me laugh on more than one page. I intend to pass it along to a theatrical scenic designer friend."
1,AVOID THIS BOOK,"It waS because of the vastly inaccurate blueprints of the spaceship Jupiter 2 that are seen in this book is the reason why I went forward with making sure to publish a book that features ACCURATE blueprints. ""Fantasy Blueprints"" of tv homes is definally an apt description of this blook. THe author would never make it as a real draftsman or architect. As a Lost IN Space fan, this book was a real disappointment. While all the other blueprints of the tv homes features do look like they were drawn by a professional, the two pages devoted to the drawings of the Jupiter 2 look very crudely drawn, as if the author never even bothered to watch the series. Not only the blueprints for the Jupiter 2 is wrong, but so is the JEtsons, MASH,Gilligan's Island, and many many others. I can't believe this book is STILL in print being so inaccurate. The author should not quit his day job as a postman."
2,Severely Flawed,"What good is a collection of diagrams that are severely flawed? The map of Mayberry is a travesty, for any season, with too many mistakes to even begin. And One viewing (episode) of the Dick Van Dyke show revealed a dozen errors in Petrie home. Likewise, the Andy Taylor home is badly skewed. I don't expect this author to be an architect, and I understand that sets are sets, not houses or towns. I do however expect him to get right the things that are evident in nearly every episode, like the layout of Mayberry's streets and the positions of living room walls. As a writer and illustrator, I am saddened by the dedication to being pretty and the lack of effort to be correct. Most reviewers here seem to prefer pretty to correct. It's up to you which one you prefer. These diagrams are good as a rough idea upon which to build and correct (except for the Mayberry map, which you'd be better off beginning again from scratch), and as such are to me not worth the price."
3,A Critique of this Unusual Book,"Although the Author makes a number of mistakes in the depicting the interiors of famous fiction people's houses; Ward & June Wally & the Beeve, Wilber & Carol Post & Mr.Ed, the Munsters (Herman & Co) etc.. he dones have some interesting floor plans for houses such as those owned by the Jed Clampetts, the Herman Munsters, the Gomez Adamses, and the Bradys perhaps for a sequel precise dimensions, architectural paintings or photographs, and a materials list of lumber, fastenings, and colors can be included to this book."
5,Riveting Story,"Earthy and realistic, this novel has all the elements to keep the reader interested page after page. Written by a veteran law enforcement officer adds a depth to the story making it all the more fascinating. Seldom does one get to enter the complex world of cops on the street with such insight. Hard to put down."
5,Inspiring! Strengthens and encourages.,"This inspiring daily devotional strenthens and encourages the reader. The author provides practical insights into scripture and makes the Bible come alive for living in today's world.Also included are prayers for recovery and a handy Index of Steps and Slogans. Letting God is a ""must have"" for anyone who is recovering from addictions of drugs, alcohol, gambling, porn, sexual addictions etc."
2,?,"I was just wondering why there is no track listing for this cd. can anyone tell me what songs are on it? *this is not 2 stars i dont know what it is, i could no submit this without giving the cd a rating though"
1,just dont get the edited version,ok so i walk in to a cd store not knowing what to buy. i stumble upon the rap grammy nomines. i go up to buy it and walk home thinking i made a good selection and when i get home i here busta rhymes going u PEOPLE want enough give me some more! Major edited. when u buy this cd just remember to check the cover.
3,"not bad, not good","These guys are actually good at what they do, but they do what a lot of other bands have done. If you want something new and exciting, go else where. If you are looking to get a cd from another band in the NIN veign, you will be pleased with this. Really, I would think they were good if they were original. Probably they will end up on a major just because they fit so well in a mold."
2,"unusual angel, jargony and a bit mean","I found this book to have used jargon and brevity at the points when it critiques LW and to be mean-spirited when it mentions the works of others. The author also takes an approach to LW's worh through a questionable diagnosis that he was dyslexic. While this an interesting angle, it's not enough to hang an introduction on.Finally, the book has numerous spelling and other editing errors."
5,Probably one of the best Thomas videos!,"We love this video. Salty is especially neat and shows the viewers that even though you may not enjoy what you're doing right now, pretty soon you'll be rewarded for your hard work and get to do what you enjoy. Salty is sent to the quarry to help out and gets the job done so very fast and impresses Sir Topham Hat. Salty is able to keep the troublesome trucks in line and is the only engine able to do so. In the Fogman story, when Hatt tries to replace Seral with a machine to warn the engines of fog, it causes a disaster and Seral gets his job back. Percy helps Harold when he crashes to the ground and learns how to be a true friend.We watch this video over, and over and over... It is just so very cute and well done. Highly recommend!"
5,great movie,"Salty's Secret:In this episode,a diesel named Salty,who loves the sea,get's a job at the quarry.but Salty was glad when he was assined a job at the docks.In Harvey to the rescue,Harvey is said to not be useful;even by Edward!!!!"
4,Another fun adventure for your little ones.,"My son is a Thomas fanatic and simply can't get enough of these toys and videos. This set of stories is just like all of the rest: entertaining.If you are looking for some quick down time as a parent, pop this in the VCR and enjoy the peace and quiet as your youngster is distracted by watching this video."
1,Totally Uneccesary,Does anyone who hasn't read the Thomas books ever wonder who some of the charachters on the wooden railway are. Well Salty and Harvey frankly were not necessary. Salty had one minor part in Percy's Chocolate Crunch and Harvey was never mentioned again. I mean Harveys kind of cool but we could do without him. Hit entertainment should stick to what the real books are about and Bear who none of you know because he's only in the books is awesome.
3,"New engines, no new showings","I liked this movie much better than my last one but I hated that they would make more charecters when they haven't even shown Bertram and Thumper from Spills Chills and other Thomas Thirlls. What about Edward? He has no real big parts in this movie. Salty was a neat engine. I bought 2 newer tapes and not a single one had Harvey a different crane engine. I get alot of vidios but the song ""James The Really Splended Engine"" is very catchy. I was startled at Harvey's voice in ""No Sleep For Cranky"". I like the way in another movie Salty is almost like a wise gruff salor. The other story's The Fogman, A Bad Day For Harold, and Elizabeth The Vintage Quary Truck were okay. I gave the movie a three because I thought it was good but I have seen better."
5,No Home Should Be Without It,I sell health insurance and love to be able to learn about the medications my clients and my family are taking.It is easily understood and incredibly helpful.A++++++++++++++++
3,Should have been better,"It gets 5 stars for Santana, Macy Gray, Susan Tedeschi, Marc Anthony, Andrea Bocelli and Sting. And maybe Kid Rock...I'm still out on that one. But the others. Oh boy. BSB's, Ricky, Christina, and Britney. Soooo overplayed and for the most part, so shallow and manufactured. Do they really deserve a Grammy nomination? I think not. When I think of all the really fantastic groups and artists out there, who, because they don't have the big bucks and big companies behind them, get little or no recognition. Instead we get manufactured artists who can only ""sing"", dance and look good. I know I will probably end up with a million non-helpful votes for my views, but that's ok. But it just seems to me, that over the last couple of years or so, songs are winning Grammys or getting nominations based on their radio popularity and teen fan base, rather than their true musical merit. And it is sad."
4,very good...,"This cd is a very good buy. Every hit song or artist that you can think of. My favorites are ""No Scrubs"" and ""Mambo #5""."
3,An empty feeling,"Owning the 1999 CD, I was looking forward to this one; but was rather disappointed finding it all little pop tunes, that were majorly overplayed. Who the hell is Susan Tedechi? She ain't that great. BSB, Britney, Christina Aquilera, Ricky Martin, Mark Anthony. It was sap 2000, rather than Grammy's 2000. Why have a CD, that is all tunes that are soooooooooooooooooo overplayed, you can pick out the tunes on the piano, just from radio plays? There are a few interesting gems; Macy Gray's and Sting's underplayed tracks, Andrea Bocelli and Santana's classics also liven up this cd."
3,"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly","Some of the tracks on this CD are truly memorable and a worthy addition to any collection. I am referring to Smooth by Santana, La Vida Loca by Ricky Martin and Sogno by the great Bocelli. Some of the other tracks such as Christine's ""Genie"" and Brittany and Backstreet Boys are not objectionable, but not great either. I quickly skip over the truly horrible tracks. Who cares about Mambo #5? Kid Rock is barely tolerable and so are a few other unnotables. Overall it is an uneven compendium of songs. Buy it used like I did, and skip the stinkers."
4,No Cher :(,Hello? Where is Cher on this CD? Believe was one of the top hits of the year and was the only record of the year nominee to be left off. What a snub!
5,It's a great variety of songs,I think this has lots of songs that are pretty good. It would be better if it had some songs that I like but too bad. I am just so glad that cher's believe was not on this album. I don't know why some people like that song but I think that song was the worst song of this millenium. That song is also very annoying and gives people headaches. If it were in here then I would give in 0 stars. Thanks Grammy Nominees for not including it in this cd. :)
4,For The Fans,"This is a great CD if you like the particular songs but don't want to spend the $$ to purchase the artists' entire CDs. There are several major songs missing (incl ""Believe"") but the artists make the decision not to let their songs be on this compilation. Think about it--why let a fan listen to their hit song on this CD when they could make alot more $$ by making the fan purchase their entire CD to listen to it? That's why I think the songs on this one are ""for the fans"". Thanks!"
3,Where Is Cher?,"This CD was alright but where the heck is ""Believe""? I thought the best selling single of '99 and the recipient of 4 nominations including Record of the Year and Best Pop Album should be included on a ""Grammy"" CD. What was I thinking? Anyhow, it's inclusion would have done this CD some good. Too bad."
1,Facing Up has to be turned down,"I bought this book because it was touted as an imformed examination of the dialectic between science and its cultural adversaries. Science lost when I turned to essay 15 ""Zionism and Its Adversaries"". Here the author presents us with his distorted view of the reality of the Zionist project in Palestine. His negative comments regarding the October 2000 condemnation by the United Nations Security Council of Israeli violence against Palestinians in their Occupied Territories is especially offensive. Mr. Wienberg is ill-informed and wrongfully chooses to use his book billed as about science to propagandize for the Zionist project. The reader who paid for his book deserves far better."
3,Won't Win a Nobel Prize for This!,"The title of my review might be misleading so I will quickly say that these essays are not bad at all (see the other reviews). However, there is nothing very enlightening here either. Basically anyone with a good head on their shoulders who has a practical understanding of how science works and has studied a little bit of philosophy could have written this. These are interesting ideas but nothing new.The man is amazingly bright, but it's funny how much advanced physics he probably considers to be ""old news"" and unworthy of writing about but now he comes up with some prevalent ideas in a subject different from his specialty (the philosophy of science as opposed to cosmology and particle theory) and thinks he has something profound here.It just seems to be a waste of his talent. Please write some more physics texts in the same spirit as your QFT books Dr. Weinberg! Now THOSE are 5 star texts that it took a Nobel Laureate to write!"
3,It's okay,"Liked the book for casual reading. Not exactly an edge of your seat, can't put down book. Hannah would have been thrown in jail for some of the stuff she pulled. I would read another of her books considering I believe this was her first"
3,Neutral,I bought the book but didn't have to use it..bummer but I did scan throught the book during my finals and there are interesting facts and knowledge about women history and movements if you are interested.
3,it is not pink,"I bought this because I wanted a pink snow brush. I didnt realize that it states colors may vary. You get a black brush. I kept it anyway and gave it to my husband. It looks like it will be a sturdy brush for the snow. For we have not had snow yet, I cannot comment on how well it holds up."
1,Amazon shame on you for shipping this.,"This item is sold by Amazon itself. It arrived but was damaged. The box was is perfect order, the item had to have been damaged before it was put in the box. The blade for the scraper had 5-6 chunks taken out of it. It honestly looks like someone jammed it down on an edge of metal to make the damage. There is nothing in the overly sized box that could have caused this. I have never had something come from Amason itself in this kind of shape.The rating is for the people who allowed this to ship since it looks like this thing has been around the block a couple times (label is pealing an dirty), the damage and the shoddying packaging."
2,Beware!,"I purchased this item because the color shown was a pink tone which my daughter wanted. However I received a dark blue color. Obviously I did not get what I ordered. Auto Alley advised me that Amazon chooses the image not them. Amazon must correctly identify the color of the product or provide a qualifier stating ""not as color shown"" or ""color may vary"" etc. Unless the image is qualified or a color choice is available order at time of purchase, customers have a right to expect item shown it what they are buying."
2,Worked great until it snapped,"Very good reach with this product, due to it's length. Also the ice scraper worked well. Unfortunately, after the 4th use, the ice scraper head snapped off, with only the usual amount of force. I believe the cold weather weakened the plastic because it snapped under almost no effort."
2,falls apart...,"... and, unfortunately, it happened in the midst of a big storm. We had 3 - one in each of 3 cars. Each held up with light dustings of snow, but bring on the blizzard that attacks your car while you're at work, and your asking for trouble. Like cheap umbrellas in a windy ally, these can't stand up to the rough stuff."
1,THIS IS NOT PINK,"Ordered this because it is advertised as pink, it is not. Amazon sent me two, both showed up blue, NOT PINK."
1,THIS IS NOT PINK!!!!!,"I just received what I thought was going to be a PINK snow brush. I received BLUE! I realize the description read ""colors may vary"" but the differance between blue and pink is a real stretch!! If you do not carry pink then don't show a picture of it!! This is very misleading....."
4,fine,"Its a good product, especially because I have short legs. The only criticism I would have is that the scraper part doesn't do that well on scraping. It seems as though it's unbalanced and will scrap at both corners and not in the middle. I noticed this when it first started to frost (Michigan). Other than that, its great for my SUV and my short limbs."
2,Buy something else,"I bought this in July and can't believe I've actually stuck it out this long. I was on Amazon to look and see how long ago I bought it to see if I could return it but guess not. I have fine hair and don't have a problem with the iron not holding my hair like the other poster but the black paint is already coming off where the screws for the spring is and on the iron as well. Also, my hair gets caught up in the screws for the spring and it's not pretty. The control is a dial and everytime I put this up to my hair I change the setting making it hotter. Not well placed control.Big waste of money, I'm looking for something else."
1,It broke after only two uses!!,"I was very disappointed with this curling iron. Maybe it was just bad luck, but the black metal curling tongs literally fell apart/off the red handle only the second time I used it!! I did love how quickly it heated up and also the size, but as for quality - not so good. I cannot recommend."
2,poor spring,"This is a nice iron but there isn't enough tension on the spring or something. My very fine hair comes right out of the iron. It just doesn't grip well enough. I don't have this problem with other irons, so I'm guessing it's the spring or a design flaw.If you have thick hair, you probably won't experience this problem and will enjoy the purchase."
1,bad placement of controls,"I used this curling iron once, and it's going to be returned. The on/off buttons depress much too easily and are placed right where you hold the handle. Hence, every time I rolled my hair, it turned off. The heat control dial is also ill-placed. I started on level 10, but by the time I was done curling my hair, it was on 20! The clip does not hold hair very tightly. I have medium thick hair, and each time I ""rolled"", it would slip right out. Very frustrating!"
4,Product Review,"The curling iron arrived super quickly and I am very impressed with it's ease of use. The only disappointing feature is that the on & off switches are right where you ""clamp on"" the curling iron, so it's kind of frustrating when you keep accidentally turning it off. Other than that, it's a great product."
1,crapped out after a year,"Worked beautifully the first year, but it inexplicably died a few months ago. I would think a curing iron would last a few years, at the very least!"
3,Wired on/off button placement,"It's easy to shut the iron off by accident because of the placement of the button.You can easily shut it off by accident and then go back to make another curl, then it will have already cooled down by then. Other than that, it works ok."
3,too early of a model. Need 2nd edition,"Good book, but i am looking for the second edition of this work. If you are looking for the earlier model I have located 3, and will consider trade."
4,"Not necessary, but still good to have","While this book doesn't serve much purpose in most campaigns, it's still a good book to get. The reason I say it doesn't serve much purpose is because most campaigns don't use our world's mythology as a basis for the gods.On the other hand, it's a good book, because it let's a DM see exactly how he/she should write up gods he/she creates. It also is a good referance for learning who the gods are throughout mythology."
4,Entertaining and Diverse,"Along with many world cultures, this book includes the pantheons of several fantasy series, providing a brief introduction to the series. I wish it were easier to find this kind of thing for 3.5"
4,Deities,"This book has heroes and deities from 11 differant cultures. Arthurian has King Arthur, Merlin, Morgan La Fay and his knights of the round table. Arthur is a paladin/ bard. There is celtic mythology. Norse mythology has Odin, Thor, Freya, Loki and Valkyries. Odin and Thor are gods. This allows paladins and clerics to get a more better deity to champion, the Arthurian."
3,Good General Information,"Although this book does not provide specific prices for restaurants and hotels (like the Frommer's guides do), it still provides a good overview of the different regions of Switzerland. It does not cover a great many of the hotels available in some towns (for one town, I easily found 15 hotels on-line, but the book only covered 2). Also, it tends to suggest the highest priced restaurants & hotels -- not good for someone on a budget.Overall, however, the book has helped me plan what I hope is a great itinerary for our trip this summmer. If I had to give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down, I'd say thumbs up."
2,Better Things Available,"I bought this book for my upcoming trip to Switzerland. I also had the Frommer's Italy 2001 book to compare. The Fodor's book is hard to follow and is not very informative. Frommer's has a much more user friendly way of presenting the material, is more detailed, and provides better ideas for the typical tourist and those who want to do things differently. Frommer's also included better maps and better advice. I could go on. Do yourself a favor and by Frommer's Switzerland (I did) or some other book. Just not this one (I was being nice by giving it a 2)."
3,Just OK,I bought this Betta food before doing a little research on what Betta fish would prefer. I now give our Betta fish the Pellet Food by Aqua Culture (it is supposed to be a color-enhancer in the food) - they seems to like how it tastes better - remember to only give them 3 pellets a day.I also like to give them the Blood Worms by Tetra (they are the freeze dried kind)...I alternate those two foods every other day (so they don't have to eat the same exact food every single day)...
5,What a Great Product,"I ordered a Corestretch because a friend recommended it for my tight back muscles. I have been frustrated by inversion tables because they did not stretch the muscles in my lower back very well. Literally the first time I tried the Corestretch I could feel my legs and back stretching. I was surprised how tight I actually was. I used it for 5-10 minutes and I could pain-free touch my toes, for the first time in two years. It is very simple to use...one of those "" I could have thought of this"" things, but boy does it stretch. For me, it is the best stretching device for my back and legs I have tried. I have told several people about this product, and have not heard a single complaint. I think this is a winner."
4,Gives a better stretch than not using it,"I had my doubts, but after trying it, it does give a decent stretch. In fact my back pain has gone away. Its not the thorough spine stretch I was looking for though. I would spend thousands on something that would work, but cannot risk spending on things that might work. This does work and am glad I bought it for 40 bucks."
5,Medi-Dyne CoreStretch Core Body Exerciser,"I used to have very tight lower back and leg muscles and I was in severe pain. I went to a chiropractor after going for weeks to a physical therapist without much luck. The chiropractor's office has one of these that I used to warm up before his adjustments. It, in itself, worked wonders for me. I am ordering one now through Amazon so I can save some dollars at the chiropractor's office. It's priced higher than I'd like to see but it will save money by not going to the chiropractor's office as much. I highly reccomend this device because it truely works!"
2,pictures are deceiving,"I bought this item from the PHOTO, not from the description. The photo is of a full double bed size item. What I received was a small patch that doesn't even stretch across my bed. I found another use for the item, but it didn't do what I was hoping it would do. Quality was fine but the photo was deceiving!"
5,Serious Strength Training,"This book provides the road to travel for anyone who wants to be successful in training.As a former competitive power-lifter in the early 1980's,this book includes much lost knowledge from that training era.It's a very intense book and will make you strong for life.The routines are old school and not for the faint of heart,however the strength gained will not be lost.Good luck and may the force be with you."
2,title is misleading,"this book is about body building, not strength training. and yes, there is a distinction between the two. get the Rippetoe ""Starting Strength"" book instead, if you want to learn about strength training. can't say if this book helps with body building as i am not interested or knowledgable about that. i guess a title of ""serious body building"" is kind of self contradicting :)"
5,Right on target,"I have read two more Bomba's books, i implemented his principals to the training of our young cyclists. It boosted their performance, their selfconfidence and the will to keep training. I trust mr. Bompa, that's why i bought and allready read this book. It is as i expected to be. Pure science, busting many bodybuilding's myths and showing the only way to develop a marvelous physique. Greetings from Greece."
5,Great Book,"This is the only book that I have seen that gives you the science behind the process that is written to be understood. It allows you to create a road map for success over an extended period of time. You absolutely can create a physical, nutritional and mental plan no matter your skill level."
5,Excellent resource for athletes and weight trainers,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to expand their training beyond the ""muscle mag"" mentality.It is thorough,and covers most aspects of training-diet,form,supplements.I have owned it for over a year,and refer to it all the time for modifications to my own workout.Money well spent in my book..."
2,"Serious, but what?","Every page is packed with ""information,"" and page after page strung together in a style that's extremely difficult to follow and digest, much less apply to tomorrow's workout. There are a couple pretty good basic concepts, but it doesn't take a whole book to explain that over the course of a year one should vary the types of workouts performed. The charts for the various workout designs may be helpful for some people, but there's just too many of them, and ultimately you'll design your own. I agree with other reviewers that it's a bodybuilding book, not a strength book. The proof of course is in the photographs. I'm just an ordinary citizen looking to get serious about strength as a component of my overall fitness, and this book isn't helpful. A bodybuilder might find this a helpful companion book, going a couple pages at a time. On that basis I'd give it three stars, except for the wrong title and the photographs of starved women."
2,You better be serious!,"There is a lot of information in this book. Maybe too much. Even though it says ""Serious"" in the title, the writers are trying to target everyone from beginners to professionals; they are trying to be all things to all people in all stages of strength training. In doing so, they have muddled the waters. They lose you (at least they did me) in all the definitions, classifications, descriptions, explanations, and reasons. Plus, they are promoting their products. (I guess I can't blame them for that.) It is not a bad book for those that are really serious about strength training. The information is there for those who are meticulous enough to extrapolate it and dedicated enough to put it t use. For those people, I give the book 4 ? stars. For the rest of us who prefer a simpler, more straightforward approach to improving our bodies, there are better books out there."
3,Good but not great,"Good, accurate information - which is hard to find in the fitness field - but these guys are a little too enamored of bodybuilders and isolation exercises. They've spent too much time in the lab hooking up 'roided out booby builders to the EMG machine, not enough time with athletes from real sports who need real strength. They've written one too many articles for the muscle magazines (aka soft-core porn for the supermarket magazine racks.) Bodybuilding is not about strength, it's about size. It's hard to take a fitness writer seriously who associates with that drug-abusing crowd."
2,Not to broad of information.,"Even though this book wasn't expensive, it wasn't all I thought it was. It is mostly about hypertrophy and is totally geared to bodybuilding. The periodization part is usefull though."
3,"A bodybuilding book, not really strength building.","Good book, but.......it is more a book for body building rather than strength training. Sorry, the two aren't synonymous. In fact, the two terms are intermixed at the beginning, and as the book continues, they finally drop ""strength"" word and admit they are talking about body building. A little less talk about getting ""cut"" and building mass and more on aspects of building strength please. If the title was more accurate, I'd give this book a much higher rating. ****[added 2/2008]: However... there is lots of good info to be found in this book and periodization is indeed a powerful technique for _both_ body building and for strength training. But to reiterate, this book does emphasize bodybuilding aspect, which might turn some people off. NOTE: Given that my initial review was during the early days of Amazon, now, compared to how others rate books, I would give the book 4 stars today. It's worth a spot on your shelf."
5,Serious and scientific,"This book is extremely useful for bodybuilders and strength trainers alike who want to use a periodized approach to their training. It allows you to design yearly programs to tailor to your needs and goals, whether its to lose weight, gain muscle, or increase maximum strength. There are six phases to maximize all aspects of the trainig continuum, but you don't necessarily need to employ each phase. If your goal is to increase muscle mass, you could focus on using the hypertrophy phases while using a maximum strength phase every so often. Also covered are nutrition, recovery techniques, and exercise presciptions and techniques. It does take some considerable time to design a personalized training program, but that has to be done if you truly want to reap the benefits of periodized training."
1,Waste of Money,"I returned this book to the store after the first few chapters, it was that bad. The early action in the book does not make sense - you'd think that after the earth went from day to night numerous times in quick succession, the panic would last for years. But no, after a few stampedes and deaths, people go back to their normal routines. Most of the characters are either grotesque or poorly drawn, and there are numerous scenes of violence which seem to serve no purpose other than to disgust the reader. Don't waste your money."
3,...,"""Shadowmancer"" was awful. It was ok for young adults, but the characters were uninteresting and the writing tedious.Much to my surprise ""Wormwood"" is an improvement. Taylor chucked his ""Shadowmancer"" characters and setting and made new characters and a new setting. The biggest improvement was in the overall tone of the book. The book feels overall darker, making more appropriate for the teen age group, as opposed to the pre-teens.Again, as with ""Shadowmancer,"" not too many characters were ones which you sympathize with much... but unlike the prior book, their situations are interesting enough to keep me curious as to what would happen next.The writing feels smoother and more worked out. It's obvious that Taylor isn't writing books that will become classics, but in the present ""Wormwood"" is an entertaining weekend or beach read."
1,ghastly tripe for Goths,"G.P. Taylor, an Anglican vicar who sold his motorcycle to self-publish his first book, ""Shadowmancer,"" sounds like an interesting character. Unfortunately, he's not much of a writer. His characters change motivations more frequently than they change their clothes, and plot development doesn't seem to be a priority. Add to that overripe prose and a tendency to bring up interesting questions and then drop them without really addressing them, and you end up with poorly-written drivel. There are better ways to waste your time."
1,Gamier 2nd Attempt....,"Again, I read the dustjacket description and thought I'd give this a try. I only got about 10 pages into Wormwood and put it aside. The plot *?!* does not grab you, you have no empathy with the young girl Agetta and Sabian Blake is lukewarm at best. If you liked Shadowmancer then by all means pick this up. If you skipped G.P. Taylor's first book then do the same with this, move on to something else."
2,Not easy to operate,"My vet suggested the CET toothbrush for my kittycat, which I bought and tried it on cat. I also bought the Petrodex cat toothbrush, thinking that it might work better with the molars at the back. Well, it didn't turn out to be what I expected. The longer handle of Petrodex toothbrush (almost twice as long as CET's) makes it hard to control, especially when you have a cat who is not willingly to cooperate. As for the toothpaste, cat didn't find it particularly delicious either, so I guess my vet is correct about which toothbrush to pick."
3,"OK kit for cats' dental health, cats don't like the brush","I was not sure what my cats were going to think of the malt flavor and most importantly tooth brushing overall. I brushed all of their teeth using their separate brushes that came with this kit (I got two kits) and they did OK, which is a miracle in itself. I do not like the finger brush. It is too big and even after thorough washing it had a plastic smell. Toothbrush is small enough to get to their back teeth as well -though they hated this and gave me a lot of grief when we got to their back teeth! My vet suggested wrapping small wet/moist gauze pads around my finger and use that instead of the brush. It was a much easier process using the gauze and the toothpaste. I was easily able to get to their back teeth and they did not put up a fight."
4,The toothpaste it alright.,"I don't know how much it will do the cleaning to my cats' teeth, but for now they seem to like it and let me brush their teeth with it. I know some people on Amazon wrote that their cats don't like the brush, only finger brush, - my cats seem not to mind it at all, which is a plus. So, I'll see if this toothpaste gives any results."
3,Works great if I can get it into my cats mouth,My cat will eat the toothpaste no problem but he doesn't like me sticking anything into his mouth. I got him when he was already over a year so maybe it would be less stressful if he'd been started younger.
3,"soft enough, although...","There are two brushes in the kit, one finger brush and one that looks more like a smaller human toothbrush. I tried the long handled brush on my cats today for the first time and all in all it went fairly well, considering. I bought 3 other brushes, and this brush is the second softest brush, but it is more maneuverable than my first choice (silicone human baby finger brush). So for now this brush seems to serve the purpose. Only time will tell if going through all this hassle is really doing the job it's suppose to do as far as clearing up my cats' beginnings of gingivitis.The finger brush of this kit seems too stiff and awkward to wear on the finger - also there is a piece of rigid rubber sticking out at the base of it, which would probably get in the way of things and I can't imagine it's purpose. So this brush will probably end up in the trash."
3,"Petrodex Cat Dental Care Kit, Malt Toothpaste, 2 Toothbrushes","The product states the toothpaste has ""a flavor cats will love"". My cats do not! They sniff it and walk away. As for trying to brush their teeth, maybe you could get your cats to do it but mine won't. They wiggle like a fish out of water to get away! lol"
5,Nice choice of topics,"If possible, I would give this book 4.5 starts, just because I don't think it is quite as good as the great classic by Conway, ""Functions of One Complex Variable"" (which treats all the standard topics). On the other hand, Stein and Shakarchi's book is beautiful, lucid, and obviously written by one of the grandmaster analysts of our time. Also, I give it five stars for including a beautiful treatment of the Paley-Wiener theorem, a topic that doesn't usually make its way into elementary complex analysis texts. Finally, this book has the best treatment I've seen of the Hadamard factorization theorem."
4,Very nice book,"I used this book as a first year graduate student in pure mathematics. The book covers a big part of what we can call classical material, but in a modern treatment. The treatment is beautiful comparing to many other books. The authors do not assume more than Rudin's book, and maybe some elementary course in complex analysis. I also liked this book because , at the end of each chapter, it contains a lot of exercises which are divided into Exercises and Problems. However, tThere are no answers included, and some important topics are not included in this book: Mobius transformation, analytic continuation. I believe buying this book with Lang's book as well will allow the student to have a comprehensive study of complex analysis. If you have a limited budget, I would recommend Lang's book instead."
1,bad book,This book is not helpful. There are no answers to problems. Symbols used in the problems are not explained. It is difficult to learn unless you have someone explaining the concepts for you. I would not buy this book now.
3,Very Good but Could have been Better,"I did enjoy this DVD. Excellent musical numbers with Ray Charles, Cass Elliot, and of course Andy. There was also a good comedy routinewith Jonathn Winters.But the shows are incomplete. Sceens have been cut out.I can only assume it may have been for music rights.Which too bad because I love to see entire episodes.I like the interview with Andy. I found it be very informative."
2,It's ok,I do not think the stories complimented each other very well and I did not care for all of the stories.
3,One of my favorite author,I enjoy reading this writer's books and I love that she writers series. It is like she introduces you to her family in her novels
5,OFF THE CHAIN,THIS BOOK WAS SOOOOO GOOD. VERY HARD TO PUT DOWN. I LOVED THE CHARACTERS IN ALL THE STORIES AND EACH AUTHOR WOVE THEIR OWN STORY BEAUTIFULLY. I MUST SAY IT'S HARD TO PICK A FAVORITE FROM THE FOUR. THIS IS THE PERFECT BOOK FOR A PICNIC IN THE PARK OR ON A BLANKET BY A FIREPLACE OR WHILE YOU'RE SOAKING IN THE TUB AND HAVE THE STORIES READ TO YOU BY SOMEONE SPECIAL. VERY SENSUOUS!!!!!
5,4 great novellas,"I bought the book because it includes a story by Brenda Jackson and is part of the Madris series. As usual I was not disappointed by Mrs. Jackson's work. The other stories were just as good. I believe you will enjoy this book, I know I did."
1,LEAKS!!! How Gross!!!,"I bought this 55 days ago and finally had a chance to go on a trip with it in my van/RV. It leaked all over the floor of my van. I may need to replace my carpet. The leak is from the cap--no matter how I insert the gasket or how tight the cap is. This is a poor design because the cap should be located at the top so that it is not in constant contact with fluid. Please, do not by this poorly designed product.I can't return this because it's beyond 30 days which makes me think twice about future purchases on Amazon.I would choose zero stars for this product if Amazon would let me."
5,Works like it should,If you are thinking about one I think this is a good buy. Sturdy and works well and you can't beat the price.
3,Good but not great ...,"Bought this product for a family trip to be used in our minivan. The kids like the flushing aspect like a ""real"" toilet, one reason I picked this over more expensive ones. Read that the 5 gal. tipped over; it was TOP heavy. Well, this one is too, not to mention that the bottom is not ""flat"" per se, and is narrower than the top. It tipped over a couple of times (empty, except water), so I purchased a plastic 28 qt. costume box from Walmart to stabilize it, which fit the bottom perfectly, and it still tipped over. So, the moral of the story kids is ... if you buy this, you have to tie this ... down."
5,Portable toilet review,Arrived in excellent condition in a couple of days of ordering. Haven't used it yet but seems to be ok and looks really good. This replaces an existing portable unit that died after many years. I live in an area when the electric goes out so does my water pump so these portable units are a godsend.
4,"Easy to use, very portable","We found this item to be very easy to use and portable. The seat seems a little small for the average size adult, but it works. Easy to disassemble, empty and reassemble. No need to buy special anti-odor products, just pour in a little Mr Clean (or something similar) after you empty it each time. We empty daily to ensure it doesn't get too heavy to carry. We don't put toilet paper in it and this makes it easier to empty."
4,We were happy to have it.,This was the best thing I ever bought for camping. My husband thought I was crazy but when we woke up in the morning and we did not have to walk a half a mile to the bathroom he was thanking me for buying it. Everyone should have one.
5,great/fantastic customer service,"Expecting company to use the RV in which the toilet facilites were not working, I placed this order....it came the very day I needed it...three days after ordering it! The product is wholly satisfactory...and i am very pleased not only with the product, but the company realized it was a holiday weekend and shipped it out promptly to arrive just in time. Had they waited, conditions would not have been good......thank you so much."
5,"America Under Attack: September 11, 2001","This Book was very interesting. It was also very sad. I liked this book because there were alot of interesting facts in this book. It also had some rare pictures of the attack. this book describes the terrist attack on the United States of America, and the effects on the nation and people. I reccomend this book to anybody that wants to find out more about September 11, and find the facts, not the rumers."
4,"Good for recharging, but the pressure gauge isn't much good after the first use","This kit is great for checking the pressure of your A/C and for adding refrigerant. It works just as it says. Now my A/C is nice and cold. Be sure to check the pressure to get it in the ideal range for the outside temperature. After using the whole can, I had good enough pressure, but I saved the gauge for later use. The gauge broke when I tried to use it on another can (from the same manufacturer). The screw part came loose and it let the pressure out when I tried to check the pressure of my A/C. Other than the issue with reusing the gauge, this product is good for anyone looking to recharge their A/C."
5,Works well when used properly,"My car was about 7psi low on R134a according to this kit, using what i would guess is well under half the freon i was able to recharge my A/C back to the original cooling capacity. No A/C recharge kit will solve a significant problem with your A/C however, if you are like me and have lost 7psi over the past 7 years(my a/c was professionally charged 7 years ago last week) then this kit should work great for you.Not much work to using this kit either, pop the hood, located the port, attach, Read the gauge, press the button to charge if needed."
4,Excellent followup to Durant,"Readers who enjoyed Will Durant's excellent Story of Civilization series will enjoy Craig. Durant finishes with Napoleon, so he and Craig overlap very slightly, but that's not really a problem. Craig is thorough -- and thoroughly readable.This history is limited to Europe; events elsewhere in the world are only discussed to the extent that they impact Europe. Since the 19th Century was Europe's great century, though, during which the continent essentially dominated the world, this turns out not to be much of a problem. And before studying the history of any other part of the 19th-Century world, one would want to have a solid understanding of European history anyway.This is of particular benefit to anyone who knows a lot about US history and who has been puzzled by the occasional European intrusions into it. (E.g. what was Maximillian doing in Mexico?)"
5,innovation,"yo. an ill album with out doubt. it is well worth studying the details on this peice. if you are looking for an emcee pushing the envelope and leaving the traditional boundaries of hiphop, but is still rocking that *@)^@# like no one's business - this is that album. props myka."
4,Invisible Silk & 2nd skin,"I play badminton & at times wear white so I don't like to see my undercoatings thru the shorts. These fit the bill nicely, smooth under armour I don't notice visually or physically except for the fact that they don't slide down or retain moisture. They are a great pair of extra skin that keep me dry and moving unhindered...greased lightning!"
3,Not what I thought it was...,"I actually bought the M series thinking it was the one with the mesh front panel and the solid construction over the rest of the garment... but it is not. This series is.... OK, but not something that I would buy in the future. The O Series is still the best in the entire UA series line. I have been wearing UA for over 10 years.I was a fan of 5.11 but since they have raised their prices on their shorts... UA ends up being the better value... plus I like the longer length that 5.11 simply does not offer.By the way, DO NOT buy the UA ""T"" series... the garment does NOT look like the picture and feels like something I can buy in a 5 pack at Wal-Mart for 4 times less the price!!!"
4,great fitting,"the boxer jock is awesome for an active lifestyle, a bit expensive but worth the price"
5,Best Underwear EVER!,I'm a Soldier in The US Army and I'm currently serving my second deployment to Iraq. I bought some Under Armour underwear during my first deployment and they have become essential to my comfort during my day to day tasks. They are the most durable and comfortable underwear I've ever owned.
5,GREAT!,This is must have. They are great for activity use but I love mine so much I bought more and wear them everyday. The soft front pouch gives you support but also allows you to breath while the legs area little tighter and run up your legs. AWESOME
2,Sizing chart is wrong,"""Merchant's sizing chart"" for this item is wrong. Men's medium is listed as 32-34"" waist, but it's actually for a 30-32"" waist. Seller exchanged the product for me and paid for return shipping (after a week's delay), but why hasn't this product page been fixed?For correct sizing chart go to http://www.underarmour.com."
5,Nirvana Unplugged is great,"I honestly think this is the best musical show I've ever seen. This, not really being a concert, but a great performance. Its a must own for any Nirvana fan. Youll really fall in love with it once you either watch it or hear it. There's plenty of funny things that are said in between songs too"
5,Greatest unplugged show ever!,"This is the best unsplugged performance of a rock band ever. The atmosphere is unique and awesome, the songs were chosen wisely and played beautifully, and the DVD has a great quality, specially in DTS. A must have for rock and Nirvana fans."
5,A Must Have for any Nirvana fan!!!,I saw this original performance on MTV's Unplugged and immediately became a Nirvana fan. A great upclose and personnal accustic musical performance with Nirvana and Kurt Cobain. Truly shows the very gifted talent of Cobain but a sobering reminder of a great loss for music.
4,can you hear the guitar leads?,"so, i love this concert, and i listen to the cd all the time. my problem is with the DVD audio...when i play this with my speakers at home, i cannot hear the guitar leads! they are mixed way quiet, and very in the background. i don't have a fancy stereo with 5 speakers - just an amp hooked up to the dvd player, and two big speakers, but that shouldn't matter! i have tried every audio setting (DTS, dolby 5.1) on the DVD menu, and you just can't hear the lead guitar. maybe if anyone knows of some secret setting on the DVD menu that makes it so you can hear kurt's guitar like you can on the CD version, i'd love to know it!!"
4,DVD delivered,The DVD captures the visual of a CD I've enjoyed for 10 years. Phenomenal music. I recall that it arrived quick for a good price.
3,ehh it's ok.,"I bought this after watching the Alice in Chains concert dvd thinking it would be just as good but it was not. Still nice to see Nirvana play live though. Not bad, just not as good as I expected."
2,I don't get it,"Almost every one of these songs sounds exactly the same, the same chords, the same structure. Even Kurt Cobain says on the tape that a certain two songs should not be played back to back ""because they are the exact same song."" He was right. Still, this has its ghoulish appeal, coming just five months before Cobain's suicide. He certainly looks and sounds depressed. Was he always like this, you wonder? It's fun to see a very cherubic looking Dave Grohl delicately playing his drums with Thunder Rods instead of sticks. This is for the diehard fan. I dozed off after 7 or 8 of these dirges."
5,Incredible!,"If you like Nirvana, you will love this DVD. One of the best investments I've ever made."
5,"Great DVD, Great performance","It took about 14 years for the Nirvana: Unplugged In New York to come out on DVD, but the finished product is well worth the wait. Seeing this show uncut, in it's entirety really captures how intimate this performance was. The special features include the Original MTV version of this performance, a ""Bare Witness"" MTV News special, and the best part, which was the rehearsals for five songs; Come As You Are, Polly, Plateau, Pennyroyal Tea, and The Man Who sold The World. The sound and picture quality is great, and it stings a little seeing Kurt Cobain so clearly in such an intimate setting, nevertheless, this is a performance not to be missed. Now they should release MTV Live and Loud on DVD, which was great also."
4,Elliot Scheiner does it again!,"This new version of the classic - maybe the definitive - performance from MTV's ""Unplugged"" series finally gets the 5.1 surround treatment from Elliot Scheiner, and yet again his mix does not disappoint.The imaging is superb with a very discrete mix indeed, giving you the definite impression you are there at the performance.I wish that the Audio was full bitrate DTS instead of the half-bitrate on offer, as the video quality is not what matters - or at least it shouldn't matter. After all, this is supposed to be about the music, right? If it were full bitrate, this would get 5 stars. As it is, I have to give just 4."
1,Nirvava unplugged cracked,"Got this disc for my husband for christmas, it was new And sealed in plastic, but when opened the disc was cracked and cannot be played! Sucks"
5,Where is the blu-ray of this?,"Love this concert...remaster it, do some media about it and get it out on Blu-ray. We get a nice moment in time and MTV can get their $$...which is what they whored out to in the end anyways."
5,Billie At Her Best!,"These are, in my opinion the greatest and most important songs that Billie Holiday ever made. When you hear this CD, with the list of songs arranged in the order that they are, you get to truly appreciate the great Billie Holiday. She sells herself. No serious collection should be without this piece of work. The shipping was great. Thank You Amazon."
4,A good representation.,"""Strange Fruit"" is not usually found on the smaller collections so it was nice to have it included. This collection also includes many of the better known songs that are part of her legacy. The recording quality is generally good and there is some stand out background instrumental work on a few of the performances. I like it."
5,Great Tunes,Awesome music! Billy Holiday is the best of the blues and is great for relaxing as well as entertaining friends.
3,The Invisible Man - Darrell Scott,"After hearing Mr. Scott perform with Jeffrey Foucault and Chris Smither in the summer of 2006, I dove into his music library ear first. Finding great songs like ""Heartbreak Town"". On Mr. Scott's latest release Invisible Man, great songwriting continues. ""Hank Williams Ghost"", ""There's A Stone Around My Belly"" and ""Looking Glass"" show why he is so good. ""Shatterd Cross"" written by the late Stuart Adamson (Big Country) is hauntingly beautiful, reminding me of Mr. Warren Haynes and Gov't Mule with a country flavor."
1,Pass This Up - Read The Bible and Jim Fay's ...Love & Logic,"Ms. Bell's main thrust is that parents are the ""need-meeters"" of their children. As such, it is our responsibility as parents to make ourselves emotionally healthy so that we can provide a stable and nurturing environment for our kids. Great idea, but for me, the weakness of the book is a failure to provide practical ideas for how best to execute. I think this attachment-style of parenting too often results in selfish and self-centered children who have little respect for adults or others. On the other hand, Jim Fay's ""Parenting With Love and Logic : Teaching Children Responsibility"" is easy to read and provides instruction on meaningful ways to interact with children so that they grow up feeling loved and being responsible for their own behavior."
5,Good Experience,The overall experience was very good the item arrived in time for the christmas holidays.
2,Should have been called jackson 5 greatest hits and more,Too many Jackson 5 songs. They sound more like pop than motown. Too many repeat singers overall. Which there was a better selection
4,Nice change,"Motown music for the holidays brightened up my playlist in December, and this is a good set. Try it for next season."
4,More Christmas R&B,What can I say I have everything from the Carpenter and Andy Williams to The Sounds of a Soulful Christmas Need a good mixture
1,This is just to clarify,"If anyone is thinking of ordering these, the sizing menu is correct, at least in size if not in name. For me, a 6.5 in the US is a size 38 in Europe."
5,Excellent album of female singers!,"I think that this was a great idea to put the hottest female singers, from the popular to the underrated, on one album! And they succeeded. There is a power ballad rock driven dominance on most of the album, but a few uptempo numbers, like Cher's fun dance number Believe to change it up a bit. I like the ones with Cher, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Christina Aguilera, Bonnie Raitt, Natalie Merchant, Heather Headley and others. The album does focus more on women's themes in terms of the lyrics, but the feelings are more universal. Truly entertaining musically."
5,Very Good!,"It's all great! The only change I would make is that they should have used Kelly Clarkson's ""Miss Independent"" instead of ""Low."" That song is better, it was a bigger hit, and it fits better with this CD's theme. Other than that, if you love girl power, this is for you!"
3,Not great,"Was disappointed in this cd. Not what I thought it would be. I should have listened more closely to the clips before purchasing. No fault of anyone, just not my taste."
4,Excellent practie book,More than 600 examples... just great for practicing! But you've got to have some knowledge before practicing...
2,Very fragile,"This mp3 player is very simple, doesn't have a lot of space available, and is very fragile. My display stopped working entirely after bumping up against a wall with it. I then tried to find support information for it, and that was even more of a task. Finally I gave up. If you're looking for a good MP3 player, I recommend the SanDisk Sansa Clip instead. I have that now, and it has many more features, and is much more sturdy."
4,Nice MP3 player,This is a great player for the kids.The software is very easy and it is a snap to load songs onto it.I use Yahoo music and it works really well
3,Right Ingredients But Poor Texture,"Go Raw Organic Live Pumpkin Bar has the right ingredients to become a great food bar. Organic ingredients checked, sprouted seeds checked, raw foods checked, gluten-wheat-and-nut-free checked.But unfortunately, it doesn't taste good, at least to me. It's hard, dry and difficult to chew. Yes, it fills your mouth with the flavors of pumpkin seeds, but the tough texture makes eating difficult and spoils the eating experience. With each bite, you've got to chew really hard and long. Even then, I'm not fully convinced that I've thoroughly broken the food down in my mouth. Going healthy doesn't mean eating foods such as this. There are much better tasting healthy food products out there. For one, the company'sGo Raw Pizza Flax Snaxtastes much more palatable and easier to stomach."
3,Not a terrible book,"This book is not terrible. I found it to be cliche at times, and it definitely contained a number of gender stereotypes, which the author would include and apologize for, which I found to be somewhat annoying. It's a quick read, so at least I didn't feel like I was wasting a lot of time. I have read a lot of books on women in corporations, and I didn't think this one was particularly new or innovative, and at times, the writing was poor. At the end of every chapter, there were exercises, and I did think those were helpful. For example, one suggestion was to write one hand written thank you note per week - not particularly innovative, but it is a good practice, I think, and a good reminder to do that.In all, I think Lois Frankel's books are much better written, with much better advice."
3,Tiny swing arm lamp,You can't tell from the picture how tiny this lamp is. It is more suitable for a child's room than anywhere else. Otherwise the lamp itself is ok. The shade is made from very cheap material and really needs replacing.
5,Whole Wheat Orzo,I like to cook with whole wheat orzo rather than regular and my store stopped carrying it. This product is great.
5,Whole grain deliciousness,"This product is delicious, and healthier than regular orzo. What I especially love is the packaging: the jar with screw-top is much more convenient for storage and allows for easy measuring."
5,Great WW Orzo Replacement!,"I found this product to have great texture and taste. My wife uses it to replace ""traditional"" Orzo in all her recipes."
5,Great food,"We've been looking all over for a wheat orzo and decided to try this. It has worked very well in all our orzo recipes, hot and cold, save for one that was just OK. It has a stronger flavor than regular pasta made with bleached flour, so it does best in recipes with bolder flavors. Like most wheat pastas, it needs to be boiled for just the shortest amount of time, so that it remains very firm. We haven't overcooked it yet, so I can't say if it will get mealy and mushy like a lot of wheat pastas do. Highly recommended."
3,"Nice, but somewhat disappointing","I was somewhat disappointed after reading this book. I was expecting more, although I don't know exactly what. Much of the material can be found in other form in other sources, albeit scattered all over the place. My main complaint is that it did not give me too much to think about that I had not thought about before."
2,Didn't Go Far Enough At All,"While Paulos undertakes a very ambitious and intriguing topic in this book, his efforts do not go far at all ... a lot of the material covered in this book was covered in his previous books that dealt solely with mathematics and his efforts at bridging the analysis of mathematics with stories is weak at best. He should have put much more emphasis on the craft of building and reading stories and how that relates to peoples understandings of probability and statistics. Disappointing."
3,A disappointment...,I found this book pretty superficial. I really hope that most people don't find Paulos mathematical musings novel and unknown. They're really pretty basic. I was heartened to read the reviews here that noted that his other books are much better than this one. I will try one of those.
5,Excellent!,"Paulos is a strange combination of a mathematician and a story-teller. He tells a story and near the end you realize you learned some math or he does some conceptual math (without equations) that suddenly turns into a story. Good exposition in this book about probability, complexity, literature, etc. Excellent."
3,Neither as interesting or informative as his other books,"I have read all of his books; this, unfortunately,is the worst. After finishing it, I knew nothing more, nor had anything more to think about. His other books, on the other hand, were always edifying and inspiring. His core theme is not very interesting or persuasively advanced. Of course there is a relationship between mathematical concepts and verbal expression. Mathematics inheres in the very fact of rational verbal expression. Without it, there could be no rational expression. His discussion of a more ""scientific"" theory of literature, is long-winded and unconvincing.The book is most interesting when he identifies and explains common errors in judgment manifest in common stories. But even here, he mostly belabors the obvious.My final sense was that this book, unlike his previous efforts, was written primarily to make money. The intellectual love which shimmers in his other work, is completely missing.RRL"
2,SPS I SOnd Threate,I recently purchased a PSP I sound theatre system for my Nephew who also purchase a new PSP. The PSP does not fit properly at all unto the speaker and i don't know how to contact Amazon about the problem or to return the speaker. Can someone who purchase this already tell me whether it fitted of have the same problem. Please be careful with purchasing this.But the price is excellent.
4,"Not a game, a nice convenient sound system","very nice. remote didn't work,but I didn't care because the main product itself is very convenient and works very well."
5,"""The Book is Changing My Life """,Mike Litman I want to thank you for writing this book. The Book transform me everytime I read it. The book is giving me confidence to after dream to become a multi-millionaire. Folk who read reviews this is must book to have because ordinary people in this book became millionaires.
2,Like Watching a Show with too Many T.V. Commercials,"I bought this book thinking that it would give me some insight into the millionaire mind. I was disappointed to find that its mostly just a clever way of marketing all the books and services that the 'featured millionaires' have out there. They give you some useful tidbits of information but nothing really substantial...if you want more, then you guessed it...you have to buy their books! All the dialogues flow in exactly the same way, so the reading gets fairly dry once you've read a few of the chapters. There are substantial spelling errors which is kind of annoying. Overall this book is a tease...although you can find some useful information here, you can find much more valuable information out there without feeling like you're watching T.V. Commercials."
3,Great ideas for anyone,"The first third of the book was absolutely terrific with various successful people offering some wonderful motivational thoughts. The rest of the book bogged down, but the first third or so is worth the purchase price. I was distracted often by the enormous amount of misspelled words. For a book that espouses ""going the extra mile"", their proof reader never entered the race, and I found this problem to be completely the opposite of the ideas espoused within. Nonetheless, the book is worth reading. It's a treatment of wealth from perspectives such as spiritual as well as a discussion of methods, processes, and motivation."
3,Sloppy.,"In the beginning of the book, one of the guests stressed that the command of the English language is crucial to success. I have NEVER seen this many spelling mistakes in a book and it is a disgrace for the publisher to publish such a sloppily written piece.Mike Litman seems to be talking more than his guests in some of the interviews and his presumptuous attitude is quite annoying. The book is hastily compiled and repeats the same information in different interviews. If you truly want financial independence, read: The Millionaire in You, by Michael LeBoeuf. It has opened my eyes."
1,Watch Out!,"When I saw the name Robert Allen that was a great big red flag! Remember the ""nothing down"" craziness? Now it's informercials disguised as books. Don't waste any money on this nonsense."
5,This Book Will Change Your Life,"I spent 15 years in the corporate world trying to become successful--but each promotion only brought more frustration. When I started studying success on my own, I realized that working for someone else was never going to help me achieve financial freedom, and no amount of college education was going to make me successful.""Conversations with Millionaires"" teaches you the essential principles you never learned in school. This book will change your life. Mike has captured the wisdom of the leaders in the success world in a way that will help you start on the road to financial success, peace, and personal happiness.In the book, Mike interviews several millionaires who share their success secrets, challenges, and what they learned in the process of becoming wealthy and successful. It is a wholistic approach to success, which not only teaches you how, but also motivates you and gives you the confidence to take action."
5,This is my bible!,"I just loved this book. A friend lent it to me and I was so impressed I ordered my own from Amazon the same day.All the greatest motivational, business and investment brains in one book - magic!You can't help but be motivated by Mike Litman's personal style too - you feel like you are actually in the room with him rather than reading a book.One word of warning though - you will need more than one highlighter pen!"
3,"lots of hype, but some good info","I am a fan of: heavy info, little hype. This was just the opposite, but that is expected, as it is the transcript of several radio shows from Mike Litman. The grammer is exactly as it was on the show, no editting seems to have been done.The thrust of Mike Litman's show seems to get folks excited about learning more about the guru dejour... which is not all bad.Over all, a fairly interesting overview of some of today's most prolific gurus."
5,The Power of the Millionaire Mindset: The First Step!,"I just returned from the Robert Allen Millionaire Retreat in Norwalk, CA where these two authors were present. I had a chance to read the book during some breaks and chat with others who had the book. These interviews capture the essence of the millionaire's mindset which is the basis for all consistent financial success. These two guys understand what's going on in the field....by talking with experts and also getting some highly-specialized training in this area.While it's high sales ranking can be directly attributed to the power of the Internet courtesy of Mr. Robert G. Allen, this book is nontheless an excellent collections of brilliant ideas not to be passed on.It is a valuable read (either for new ideas or to reconfirm others) for anyone serious about becoming financial wealthy and who understands the structure/significance/power of beliefs."
5,Great Stuff! Kept Me Up All Night...,"Here's your chance to learn from not one, but nine mentors who have walked the walk. The saying success leaves clues is right on! In this terrific book they give you the actual steps they took to achieve great wealth. You will learn the specific mindset they've applied. My advice is simply this... Read this book and then read it again."
3,conversations,"This is a book on exactly that, a radio host conversations on the air with these millionaires. You really do not get in the heads of the millionaires, but their are some great points."
1,Worst Book Ever Written,"Hi,This is the worst book ever made.It shouldn't be sold as a book, It should be sold as audio tapes it would be fine.this book is all conversations you need to read it many times to catch the information ,but if written as real book format it will only be in 30 page or more."
2,"Great Idea, but.....left me hungry for more","This kind of book is an excellent idea! HOWEVER, there isn't much substance to this book. I have been interested in studying people who have been very successful since 1983. Pick out a sucess book or a biography about a successful person who has lived in the past 150 years and I probably have read it. I LOVE to read about successful people and how they did it, what personality traits each had in common, etc. But this book just wets my beak! I need and want to know more, but Littman just cuts it off. He should say less and let the people he interviews say more. Once again, great idea, Mike, but we need more to really get our teeth into it!!! Try it again, Mike, but give us more meat!"
1,Not worth the money,"First time I write a review, but I thought I would take the bother. I did not like this book. Although the title is accurate, it is about conversations with millionares, the conversations are not very enriching. I would have prefered to have spent my money on something else.BE WARNED!!! In the book there is a web page address were two free gift are promised, this is not true a you are requested to sign up with your e-mail, only to be bombarded with SPAM, and end up with no gift."
5,"Good Battery, nuff said",I purchased this for my Kodak digital camera. It works a heck of a lot better and longer than standard AA batteries.
2,Needs More Life Stories,Whenever the author describes her life and her emotions the story is great. But there is way too much lobster fishing details for my liking.
4,Seminal,"I liked the book. I don't know what more author Gitlow could have written, and not been persecuted by corporate America for the rest of his life. Still, it was kind of like reading an Alaskan weather forecast...""Today and tonight will be sunny."""
5,Timely Aid,"I was fortunate to read this book before undergoing removal of root-filled teeth and amalgam fillings. My dentist had recommended an implant to replace an extracted root-filled tooth. This book points out the danger of such an immune system challenge (I chose a bridge of biocompatible materials instead) and provides further updates to It's All in Your Head. Especially helpful are the sections on root canals, cavitations and detoxification."
5,Huggins is the man,"Huggins is the point man for the third war against dental mercury, and the book is excellent. The ADA is a national disgrace, as is the FDA. But that's another story. The cost to our country in the needless suffering of our populace due to the use of dental mercury amalgam (outlawed in many other countries) is enormous. You owe it to yourself to read this book."
5,Complete and well researched,"I am appalled at the cover up of our helath care system in order to continue with huge profits and ""0"" responsibility. This is true for not only denistry but for health care in general. Medical schools are literally run by the drug companies who ""donate"" (or should I say bribe)huge amounts of money for research that is tilted in their favor. First of all I listen to people like Dr. Huggins to prevent disease, but if I ever get cancer anyway; I would ""run not walk"" to Mexico where people are free to use any form of treatment they want.Thank you Dr. Huggins and Levy for the courage to speak up while standing all alone in front of the powerful ADA. If it were not for people like you, we would have no chance in this country to prevent or stop these monstrous diseases that are becoming epidemic. This book is well worth every penny and I would pay a $100 for it to give to family and friends. Get this book, and follow it's advice!"
3,TOO MUCH INFORMATION!,"No comparison was given as to shelf life of toxic metals vs biocompatible materials. Unless one can travel and/or pay a recognized large sum of money-$325 i was asked for a consultaton and it would not be covered by a dental plan or ins. This would be a 4 hr drive and I can't afford it, I would risk having the metal taken, but can't find IAOMNT designation for dentists that follow extraction protocol. I'm looking for someone close who will take medicaid."
5,Very important work.,"I consider this book a must read if you are concerned about your health and want to know more about the effects of toxins in your mouth. Although the best thing is to find a dentist that is aware of this issues, (unfortunately hard to find) as a consumer you should be as informed as you can."
1,Another rip-off.,"Just my opinion, but this appears to be another gimmick to sell books and get your 15 mins of fame. Like doctors and dentists are clueless. Didn't convince me of anything."
1,Another Pseudo-scientific money-grabbing topic,"As a practicing dentist and scientist who could stand to generate a lot of income from the unneccessary removal of amalgam fillings, believe me when I say that from a ""toxicity"" standpoint, amalgam is a proven safe material, having been used in almost every country in the world for over a hundred years. There are other drawbacks to the use of metal fillings (esthetics, expansion-contraction) that should factor into one's decision to use composite over amalgam to restore a new lesion, but from a 'poisonous material' standpoint, I am in concurrence with the American Medical Association, the American Dental Association, and the World Health Organization, that amalgam fillings are safe, reliable, and effective."
4,Planted firmly within the Great Tradition,"This band is definitely within the tradition of old-school 80s goth rock. You get the heavily ring-modulated sounds of electric guitars, playing arpeggio riffs in minor keys. You get the strangled baritone yelps of the singer. You get an unusual classical instrument --- here, electric violin --- and you get a real live drummer to boot. You get an old-fashioned punk song (""So Many Ways"") as well as longer, building pieces (my favourite is ""Little Girl Lost""). You get songs about pain and fear and drowning and self-inflicted injuries.They have put together almost the complete package here. You will feel like you're on familiar ground here, and that's a good thing. My one criticism concerns the lyrics: they're pretty over the top, and not quite as clever as they should be."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"I'm partial to carafe coffee makers. It keeps the coffee from getting that burnt taste. I like the brushed steel and the black cap hides coffee stains. Clock timer is a nice feature. Carafe has wide mouth for easy cleaning. Only complaint is it seems to take over 5 miniutes to brew 10 cups. This is why I rated it 3 stars instead of 4. Also, the tab used for pouring on the cap, I find I use this for leverage to open the cap, since there seems to be a suction feature that keeps the coffee warmer. I wonder if it'll hold up. This coffee maker does keep the coffee warmer longer than any other carafe I've had. Overall, happy so far!"
4,West Bend Thermal Carafe coffeemaker,"The thermal pot is amazing. I can make a full pot of coffee at 6am and when I clean out the coffee pot at 10pm, the coffee is still warm.Easy to use and easy to program.The swing basket is rather flimsy. It almost feels as though the coffeemaker is a cheap toy. You have to be very careful that there is no perforation in the paper coffee filter or the grounds will clog up the hole in the basket and you have a mess on your counter (I learned that on day 2). The coffeemaker comes with a permanent gold filter that works very well, however, I prefer paper filters.You also have to be careful that the carafe is perfectly placed underneath the basket or you will have a big mess on your counter. The hole on the carafe is so small, it is unforgiving if it isn't perfectly aligned with the basket."
3,Can Make a Mess,"I bought this pot over a year ago and have been using it ever since, so it gets 3 stars. However, if your coffee is ground too finely, there are problems. First, the fine coffee will go right thru the metal screening on the basket and end up in the pot and your cup. Second, if you replace the filter provided with a paper one, sometimes the paper will collapse and the coffee grounds will block the exit hole in the bottom. Then it overflows and you have a big puddle of brown water on the counter flowing everywhere.I like the metal carafe which doesn't continue to cook the coffee once it's dripped thru. The temperature problem is iffy. It's OK in the summer months, but in winter it cools down very quickly. However, I have no problem with heating a cup of coffee in the microwave and it doesn't affect the taste."
1,Westbend Coffee maker,"I ordered this on Amazon and it did not get the free shipping as it was coming from unbeatable sales. I paid $13 for it to be shipped to me and when it arrived it was broken. I then called and was told I could send it back to get credit, which I did at another $14 shipping. None of the shipping was refunded to me, so I paid $27 for nothing."
3,Good enough,"Just purchased this coffee maker as I wanted a thermal carafe. It's good enough to keep (rather than hassle of returning) but I wouldn't recommend it. Keeps the coffee hot (nice), programmer works and is easy. The plastic trim on the carafe is cheap (didn't expect that from a $60 unit) and pouring is difficult (very thin stream, need to unscrew the top and then use two hands to pour the coffee without spilling). Too much co-ordination for early morning."
2,Doesn't keep coffee hot for very long,"I ordered this unit for the apparent value. Having broken several glass carafes and tiring of the burnt taste of coffee sitting on the electric element for a few hours this seemed like a great solution. The unit is bulky and fit and finish are average. There is a removeable filter basket that you can rinse out, but it sits in another 'basket' that you can't remove to clean. The timer is a nice feature. Biggest problem is that the coffee only stays hot for 1/2 to 1 hour after brewing. This is even the case when the carafe is pre-heated with very hot tap water. I guess I have to spend a lot more for a better insulated carafe. I completely disagree with the other reviews that claim the coffee stays hot."
4,great but leaks water,"This has been a great unit since we purchased in 10/07...but it started leaking cold water out of the bottom several weeks ago. My wife thought I was ""water poring "" challenged but when I demonstrated the problem-water coming out of the bottom weep hole- she agreed it was a unit issue. I called WestBend Customer Service, told them about the issue, gave them the date code for the unit and was told they are sending me a new one. Perhaps this was a problem limited to a certain manufacturing period. We really love this unit and hope the problem doesnt reoccur!"
3,Could Stay Warmer,Overall the coffee maker works well. The only problem is that the coffee doesn't stay hot long enough. After 2 hours it is still warm but requires a quick trip to the microwave to make it hot.
2,worst coffee pot ever....,Very unsatisfied with this appliance. Would gladly pay more for better quality and will the next time.
3,Works well; coffee okay,"I've been a Mr. Coffee fan for decades because the coffee tastes great. Over the years I've purchased, tried, and rejected many other brands solely on the basis of taste. This West Bend is one more in the long line of rejects. It's a good looking, well-designed and -manufactured unit, but the coffee just doesn't measure up to my bottom-of-the-line Mr. Coffee. So it's back to my old glass carafe with the drippy spout. Darn!"
4,Coffeemaker,"We've enjoyed the West Bend Coffeemaker. My Husband and I have different schedules in the morning so it is especially nice that once the coffee is made it stays hot in the carafe (away from the coffeemaker) all morning. The permanent filter is convenient as well. The decrease in star was because it took so much time to get it (the seller was out of town) and it did arrive pretty dusty. I guess it had been stored for a while. Anyway, overall we're very happy."
3,"Stainless Carafe great, but plastic coffee holder/basket broken.","The plastic coffee basket/Arm broke & manufacturer replaced quickly. Overall, decent coffee maker for price. I have the programable model. Like the fact there is no heating element to keep coffee warm and the Carafe keeps coffee warm for several hours."
1,Missed the Mark,"I am living in China and taking Mandarin lessons - I had a friend bring me this book without having looked at it. It has a major flaw - the Pinyin (the a-b-c version of Characters) does not have the tone markings. This means that you will not be understood without the correct tone - I know that from repeated experience. For instance ""mai"" can be pronounced 4 different ways each with a different meaning - pronounced in 4th tone is to SELL and 3rd tone is to BUY and 2nd tone is to BURY. Look at the learning dictionaries by Tuttle publishing with the author of Li Dong and then get a Rough Guide or Lonely Planet phrase book -they show Pinyin with tone marks. A language DVD and hand recorder would help you to match the tones very well if you are serious."
2,100% Corn,"Corny. It's an old word but an apt description of this book. It starts well enough, but melts into bathos as the protagonist goes from the cruel city to the countryside, where he meets one soap-opera saint after another. There's the old lady who needs an operation she can't afford, the sensitive adolescent who's afraid to leave home for college, the wise Indian matron, the hulking retarded kid who just needs a little attention, and his dad, the tough but fair sherriff. And the hero, another of those armed robbers with a heart of gold you meet so often, manages to save every one of them.It's like starting out in a caper movie and ending up on the Andy Griffith Show. Jeez, when did America go all corny? How did the country that produced Scorsese and Hunter S. Thompson turn chicken so fast?"
4,confusing but fun to read,"I'm so serious I still have no freaken clue what ... was going on in this book (I bet you Banks wrote it while on acid) but hey what a fun read.That kid Bascule and his talking pet ant are fun charachters too.From what I could figure out,it had somthing to do with an impending distaster that is gonna hit the earth and a conspiricy to try to cover it up. What I cant figure out though is if they stoped the disaster in time, who rules earth, what time they are living in, what reality most of the book is taking place in, you know unimportant stuff like that. I guess I really should read it over again, but that would probably take me a while seeing as half of it is written in whackily confusing phonetics which make reading it like trying to decipher another language. Despite all of these facts though it seriously is a really fun read."
1,Painful Reading At Best,"This book, for the most part is written from the viewpoint of a character that can only write phonetically. Also he speaks with a strong scottish accent. (""ef I 1/2 2"" = ""If I have to""). And this goes on for hundreds of pages. I found myself struggling to decipher passages and at the end the sheer fact that I am a Banks fan kept me going to finish it. I think this was a literary experiment - one that did not work. If you can't find a regular mass market version used, or its not in the library, skip it. This is barely about the culture anyway -- and the payoff isn't worth the struggle."
4,Terrific SF for non-SF readers,"I'm not a sci-fi person generally, but I thought this was a terrific, terrific book. Banks creates a spectacularly complete world in which his separate plot lines bend and weave with authority and certainty. I have rarely encountered an author so creative or a fictional world so comprehensive. He demonstrates his total literary mastery, however, in sekshuns writen fonetily, toled by a ok, nun to brite felo hoo seez mutch more than mosst peepul do. Whereas the same technique drove me bonkers in ""Riddley Walker"", in ""Feersum Endjinn"" I found myself looking forward to the phonetic sections and the point of view expressed in them. Amazing experience."
2,Maybe 2.5,"I guess I missed the appeal of this story. I would have enjoyed it if the author had done a better job of explaining the set-up earlier in the book. Challenging reading is fine with me, but I can't remember when I had such a hard time trying to determine what/when/where/why, etc. The reviews which led me to try this book presented such an interesting picture, but it didn't live up to it. Contrary to other reviewers, I did enjoy Bascule's phonetic speech - it helped to shape him as a character. In closing, if you must get this, go to Amazon UK."
3,Good premise but I couldn't finish it,"I've read at least half a dozen Iain M Banks and enjoyed them all,.. until this one. The world IMB has created here is a good one but I struggled to read through Bascule's chapters. These are written entirely in a terrible mix of sms short-hand and a phonetic, child like form (like the title of the book) and for me this took away from the story and in the end I just couldn't continue more than 17% through the book. On to his next book for me!"
5,Captivating,All the Mackade Brother books are fabulous! I love how she entertwined the story with the Civil War soldiers and families.
4,The heart of Devin mackade,Wonderful story line and captivating ending. Cassie and her family are strong and preserved through very difficult times. Great read
4,Devin's heart of gold,"Devin is the classic tough guy with a heart of gold. Cassie, the woman hurt and scared of love. While their union was inevitable, the loose ends tied up to quickly and easily for me. I'd have loved to see a bit more on that adjustment. As much pain as she'd been through, you know there are bound to be a few more bumps there on the way to that happily ever after."
3,Good story,Good story with history but predictable outcome. Character's are all good. Ghosts add a bit more fun to the story.
5,The Heart of Devin MacKade,"The MacKade Brothers Series were the best - a lot of heart with some History. Living in Pa. helped me to relate to the history of the Civil War. Family to me is very important. Loved that the brothers were there for each other, thru thick and thin."
1,Too many typos,"I enjoyed the first two books in this series and was really looking foward to the story of Devin and Cassie.There were so many typos In this book, I almost put it down from sheer flustration.Several pages were repeated several time until sometimes I didn't know where I was.About halfway thru Rafe's name got changed to Rave and stayed that way.Several words were run together.It was like reading a puzzle.No book of any kind should be this poorly edited."
5,"Tears of hurt, sadness, pain, joy....","And love is the best way to describe this Mackade read. If you haven't read this series, please do so in order so you can feel all the emotions that was leading up too and placed in this book. You'll enjoy the read much more."
5,another great book,the mackade brothers books were all good!! This one was my favorite! Couldn't wait to see how it ended read it in a day!!
3,It's a Romance,"It is what you expect from a Romance, I read to escape and it is a story you don't mind escaping into. No real life similarities and that kind of stuff. But it is a book to keep you interested."
3,Good Read,"Third of the four MacKade books, and the most emotionally intense.Roberts creates her usual likeable characters in a strong small town setting, with plenty of romance and humor, all lightly flavored with Civil War history and a couple of ghosts.This is the romance that we've been waiting for, as the hero's long unrequited love for the heroine has been known from the first story. It is also a testimony to the author's skill in creating characters that we are invested in, because both back stories are ones I don't personally care for: the character that has spent years quietly suffering and yearning fills me with impatience, and I lose all sympathy for the abused wife once children are involved. Yet, Roberts had me caring and caring deeply for both.The scenes with the kids were my favorites.You'll enjoy the book (and the tears you shed) and look forward to the next."
5,The Heart of Devin MacKade (The MacKade Brothers),This whole series is an easy read and a cute love story. And the love and loyalty among brothers is heartwarming.
5,4.5 stars,"Odd. I don't like victim heroines, and I don't like the way Nora does paranormals, and this story is very similar to Rising Tides (Ethan Quinn's story), yet I liked this one much better than the first two. Go figure.The fact that Cassie was a victim did make me feel a little distant from the story, and her reaction to her son's fear was way out of proportion.Still, I think Nora did an amazing job, particularly for a category romance, in portraying these characters. They were very believable. And Devin may have been slow to let Cassie know how he felt, but at least he wasn't the silent type."
1,Worst tribute album ever?,"Yeah, it really is. It should be burned. Every classic Pixies song completely destroyed. Trust me it's terrible. Don't buy it, please. For the love of God leave this page right now."
2,"Yawn, not very good","My 8 year old played Xmen for about a half hour on Christmas morning, and hasn't touched it since, even when I ask him to play!! Also, he hasn't even attempted to open the other game for the system - Ben 10, he's just not interested. The game is far too primitive in it's action and scenery when compared to other options ie. PS2, XBox, Gamecube. It needs more variety! The card scanning is time consuming and boring!By the way, I love Amazon! FAST shipping, great prices!"
3,hyperscan system needs improvement,"Only works with cards bought specifically for this game. Currently not that many games available. My Sons likes Ben 10 starter pack, wish for more cards as starter only has six.Sons initally thought that it would work with other playing cards such as Yu Gi Oh. Was disappointed that it doesn't. Wants Yu Gi Oh characters cards for this game (which as of yet don't exist)"
3,not bad,"I wouldn't consider this game a waste of my $5 (since I got the game, the box, and the book, hurray!). It's definitely hard as hell (but there are harder games, aka Ecco) and doesn't exactly look that fantastic. I enjoyed some of the music, but like most Genesis games I turn the volume down or off. But when you're bored or you're a hugecrazypsycho fan of Arcade like me, you're not going to argue with buying or playing this game. It's fun for me, and even better because I used a Game Genie on it. So don't totally think about passing it up, but remember that if you're not cheating, this sucker can get pretty damn hard despite the first easy level."
3,Any reform is better then none.,"I prefer ""the Fair Tax Plan"" proposed as HR.25 by John Lindner of Georgia. The only sure way to get politicians to stop needless spending is to dry up the pocket book.We need to eliminate the ""withholding"" of taxes from employees checks so we have to think about the money we send the government. I think this would be the biggest incentive to changing a sick system as anything."
3,"Useful, but limited, information","While I support a flax tax, I was disappointed that this book omitted many key arguments. Most significantly, the moral argument was omitted. Unfortunately, like many economic works, this book uses the utilitarian approach demonstrating that everyone, even government revenues, would be better off with a flat tax, and therefore all should accept it.This book does do a good job of showing the weaknesses in the arguments against a flat tax, and looks at a few countries that have already adopted one (albeit not to closely).Overall, for people looking to honestly understand the implications of a flat tax, this is a good book. But for those looking to understand whether it is right or wrong, and why, this book will not be helpful. For those, I would recommend Ayn Rand'sCapitalism: The Unknown Ideal."
1,Use the time you saved doing taxes to read a map of Europe,"Paraphrase from one of the book's highlighted sections:""In dramatically lowering taxes, Slovakia and its fellow Baltic states...."" Since when is Slovakia (hint: small country, east of Austria, north of Hungary) a Baltic state?This book contains the usual nonsense about doing your taxes on a postcard. We all know that the hard part is not in computing your tax, but in calculating your income. That's what all those IRS forms are all about. The only way to make it so simple would be to tax only reported wages - shifting all the tax to those who work for a living."
1,flat tax is a fraud,"I am a CPA who has practiced for over 30 years. 99.9999999% of the complexity of taxes has to do with determining just what is income and what is a deduction. Flat rates won't change that. Steve Forbes entire premise is a fraud. I have been listening with frustration to his inane ramblings for years, and I can't understand how he gets away with it."
2,Taco Mex Taco Plate 4PACK green,Slots for the tacos are too narrow. I would rather have glass instead of plastic as these did not have instructions for the dishwasher.
2,Promising Beginning Turns Into a Joke,"The beginning of this movie seemingly sets the stage for a great manhunt type western. A wounded man must survive in the cold wilderness with little more than a knife and all the time being hunted by a relentless and cold pursuer. That's the first ten minutes of this movie.The story and the script just get ridiculous. First of all, I like a good artsy film but it has to make some kind of sense. This movie does not. Second, I think if you are going to get abstract, you need to have some idea of where you are leading people with your abstractions. This movie smacks of having no point other than being abstract, and that means BAD SCRIPT.They keep you in the dark about why this man is pursuing another man to the death for a long time, and when they finally do explain it with a clumsy flashback, the flashback is a corny, sentimental disappointment which could have been better done by a grade school class play.Skip this movie or watch it for a laugh."
2,Ughhhhhhhh!!!!!!,"This movie shows a tough guy losing horse and gun so many times it was ridiculous. Story ends walking off into the sunset with no horse, no gun, no money, no friend just his conscience and his pursuer beside him going separate ways."
1,An Utter Mess,"It is amazing to me that this movie has managed to recieve an average rating above 1 star (deserves a zero). It's a complete mess from beginning to end. Gideon (Brosnan) and Carver (Neeson) are both unlikeable characters, and the actors play their roles with phony Western overstatement. Brosnan is so unbelievable as his character, it is laughable.The plot is a grinding, plodding, so-what sort of scenario in which Gideon and Carver are supposed to encounter some intersting folks along their journey and end up in a climactic face-off with each other (yawn). The only things they come across are foolish actors struggling through poorly written parts, including Anjelica Huston who shows up out of nowhere in the desert in a nonsensical cameo.To compare this movie favorably to ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" is a crime. Where ""..Josey.."" has charm, suspense, pathos, and a boat load of great characters, ""Seraphim.."" has nothing to offer - NOTHING."
2,Not impressed,"As a big fan of western movies I found this to be slow, boring and infact, it put me to sleep! I guess I'll use it for those sleepless nights and stay away from the Ambien!!!!"
1,Silly,"Overdone in the beginning, just plain silly at the end. The only Western cliche' the director did not abuse was the bison stampede. After the mysterious Indian and the magical appearance of the Medicine (Wo)man, I fully expected the film's stars to be overrun by a heard of startled Bison."
4,Who are these people and what's going on?,"Why is Liam Neeson and his posse after Pierce Brosnan? Is Brosnan a bad guy? The way Neeson's crew behaves will keep you wondering. As Brosnan struggles to keep ahead of his dwindling pursuers, the mystery is slowly peeled away. My only deduction is for the length of the film. Otherwise, it's a grand Western in the strong old style. Well worth watching and purchasing if you are a fan of Western movies."
5,A thriller of a Western!,"This movie really deserves 10 stars! Awesome scenery and fantastic directing/writing. Gideon (Pierce Brosnan) is a formidable foe for Carver (Liam Neeson), a man seeking revenge three years after the Civil War. 'War is Hell' is an understatement in this story of two men with emotional scars from the war and everything it has taken from them struggling to just keep going. Unable to put their pasts behind, they take their hatred and anger out on one another. The intensity of the action is constant as Gideon runs for his life, adept at killing anyone intending harm if they get too close to him. Both men leave a trail of blood. How much will they spill before putting an end to their personal war?Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,WESTERN REVENGE FLICK HITS THE TARGET,"Basically a revenge flick set in the West after the Civil War, SERAPHIM FALLS features Liam Neeson and an almost unidentifiable Pierce Brosnan. Apparently Brosnan wronged Neeson earlier and now Neeson is tracking him down to kill him. The two strong male actors dominate SERAPHIM FALLS with the only real female contribution coming from a strange, rather silly, cameo by Anjelica Huston, which causes this reviewer to withdraw a star from the movie's rating. The film seems to peter out toward the end (another minus) but it is an exciting Western for the first hour or so and worth your time for the good acting and the good cinematography. Enjoy Mr. Brosnans's verbal and visual characterization; a real treat."
4,"Good, Very Good, But Not Quite Great","Why only four stars? This one is predictable, and as a result, is simply a good watch. The lack of suspense does not allow this one to be considered a great movie. This does not mean its a waste if you happen to watch this movie. Quite the contrary, its an enjoyable movie to watch. Get it and enjoy!!!!!!!"
5,western is back,"It is a classical western where the revenge is the theme, Liam Neeson interprets a retired confederate colonel who seeks revenge against a union captain. the filmography is increddible and the actors too, glad to see a western revival this yearEdgar"
4,Two good men ruined by war,Breathtaking scenery. Hope to see more from this innovative -young director. Highly recommended to all western fans. Watch the extras on the DVD I found they explain the hidden meanings of this movie well.
3,Enjoyable but Seriously Overlong,"Basically it's a really much too long Road Runner (Brosnan) vs. Wile E. Coyote (Neeson and his band of incompetents). For most of the movie you're trying to figure out why Brosnan's being hunted, and which are the good guys. With the lack of smarts on display by Neeson's gang, it's no wonder they lost the War. Interesting but much too long. And it's looooong. Oh - and it has the token mystical Native American and kooky-looking preacher, so it's Hollywood-safe."
5,Theres more here than superficial moviegoers are detecting!,"Hello? The religious pilgrims suddenly show up and take away all their bullets...the indian at the water hole ends up with some gold he dumps on the ground....Angelica Houston, the woman that suddenly appears in the desert to each of them, to give them ONE bullet...it's the fight between GOOD and EVIL....Did any of them really exist? In the case of the Indian and the woman in the desert, no! They are figments of the characters dehydrated delusion in the desert! This is a GREAT movie, but because action movies have dumbed down audiences for so long, nobody GETS it.Open up your mind, open up your eyes, and enjoy this movie!"
3,Not a typical western...,"despite what some say. And it is the surreal ending that detracts from what could have been. ""Open Range"" shows it can be done. The potential becomes merely passable."
2,Not what I expected,"While the two lead chracters gave very good performances, the overall plot was - at best - weak, and poorly developed. I found the gore unnecessary. The ending was also quite poor. Two stars because of the acting of the main characters. Otherwise, it would have received one star."
4,A Fugitive-like western,"I liked this western as it was action packed and suspenseful from the git go. I got a bit of a chuckle that the two post-Civil War characters in this wild, wild American west film were Irish-born Liam Neeson and Pierce Brosnan . I'd never seen the dapper Pierce look grizzly and bedraggled before and definitely enjoyed him in his efficient, survivalist character. I was aware of the lack of Liam's Irish brogue as if it took much of his attention to speak like a western cowboy. It had beautiful cinematography but the ending was just okay."
2,Don't get too excited because of Neeson and Brosnan,"I was really excited to see this because of Neeson and Brosnan. They played their parts well, but I think the director was a little...misguided. The first third of the movie makes sense for the most part, keeping in line with the expected Western vendetta-chase. And then it turns into this really weird introspective/metaphorical/symbolic....thing. Ultimately I was left thinking, ""...what did I just watch?""Another review said there were some small parts played well, and that's true. But over all, I don't think this was worth my time, which really makes me sad because, come on: Neeson and Brosnan in one movie? Maybe it was just too much awesome for one director to handle well."
1,Yuck. Please do not watch if you a serious Western fan,"The most boring western I have ever seen. Yikes what a waste of time. I truly regret watching this movie. Sure it had nice scenery but if I wanted to see scenery I'd have watched a documentary. About 1 minute of action at best and weak action if I may say. The intro was interesting and everything slogged on ever so slowly after that. Sure it had a message, who was evil or who was good etc but they could have played it out much better as a true Western should have."
1,seraphim falls,the worst movie i have ever seen.... boring wish i i had my 2hrs of my life back... two great actors wasted thier time and ours .. glad i didnt pay for it
3,All that anxiety,and really only an average ending. Not your average cowboy movie.Not for the whole family.
2,"Good original idea, but boring!","The set-up for a suspenseful and good movie was there, but then there is no real suspense.The switch of the both main characters from good guy to bad guy and vice-versa is not very convincing. No real suspense, bad ending. It`s not a movie I would watch for a second time."
1,"Rent, don't buy","Not even a great love of Neeson and Brosnan can get you through the agony of watching this film. It was long, boring and by the end you really didn't care how it turned out. A great disappointment."
1,"Great actors, slow movie",Disappointing. With star power like this - Liam Neeson and Pierce Brosnan - I was expecting much more. Very slow and pointless. Purchased this because of the stars and the cover art and was very disappointed.
2,Awful transfer.,"Good movie, terrible transfer. Looks like it was recompressed and then blown up from standard definition. Looks washed out and out of focus most of the time."
2,Ultimately dissappointing,"This was a waste of the acting talent of some great actors. The opening sequences and subsequent escape of Brosnans character from the opening scene was indeed memorable, and the filmography stunning, but you're immediately asking the question of 'why does (Neeson) want so desperately to hunt down and kill (Brosnan)?'. This question goes unanswered for the majority of the movie, and once it's made known that the two were former war rivals and an accident takes the life of Neesons family (for which he blames Brosnan), the motivation is unsatisfying. I had absolutely no empathy with Neeson's character, who is apparently hell bent for misplaced revenge over nothing more than bad judgement, not malice. I was left with a feeling of 'that's it?' when trying to understand Neesons motive, and the ending was so anticlimactic as to render this movie utterly forgettable."
2,See the 1-star reviews,The 1-star reviews pretty much cover it. This movie gets plain weird in the end. Great scenery. Glad I watched it for free. Caveat Emptor.
3,Long,"For the fans of old westerns, this will be a welcome sight. You can often rank a western by how quickly your Beloved loses interest and mine lost it very quickly. The story follows 2 men; 1 hunting the other through and out of the mountains of the west. Both are quite dangerous/ruthless.The dialogue is kept to a precious/delightful minimum and cinematography deliberate and well-paced; no jumping from scene to scene....There are traces of Outlaw Josey Wales and likely a much richer story than can be detected. As much as I like having to figure out things, this one was a little too vague. The actors both did well.The first half paced very well and with that, the second went a little long. This story could have been wrapped sooner and deleted some parts that didn't add much of anything.For a western, it was terrifically done. For a story, it needed some work."
2,"Old school, or just old people?",I'm not really sure what the attraction is with this movie. The dialogue is so sparse at times you could have put almost anyone in these roles and come out with the exact same movie. The worst part is Where The Heck does Anjelica Huston in the medicine wagon come from and why is she there and why is it supposed to make sense?! I was sorely disappointed with this movie and the ending was just horrible. Save your time for something else...
2,"The beginning, n+1 to the end ...","That's pretty much it. With the first clash these two duel it out! But then nobody wins so they do this and that and fight again! ... but nothing comes of that so they do this and that and fight again! ... but nothing becomes of, but wait! now we see some flashback stuff and now we know why they are so pissed off! Mad! mad! So lets fight again with justification and determination! ya, ya ... there's only a few ways this kind of crap can end and I won't spoil the fun for you. Zero character development and too many name brand actors. Why is it when lots of famous people get together for a movie they always go for the bad plots?"
4,Good Flick,Really Good Western Picture.Whoever put the name on the title should be fired.I'll wager it doomed the movie.d
1,I can't believe it's not over yet ...,"Interminable ""Filth Western"".It starts out promising to be a so-so wilderness survival tale like ""Man in the Wilderness"" (1971), but spirals down (and down and down and down) from there. It seems to leave no modern Western cliche unturned.Unlike the new remake of ""True Grit"", I found I didn't believe any of the characters for an instant. The casting of two Irish actors (Pierce Brosnan and Liam Neeson) as the leads doesn't help any.Some reviewers called it ""surrealistic"", which is another way of saying ""implausible and far-fetched"".Avoid."
2,The ending fizzles.,"It's basically a two hour long chase across country with murders along the way. They call it a ""modern western"" because hat color doesn't correlate with integrity. The main characters commit atrocities, but you're supposed to identify with them at different times because they can be rationalized as ""victims."" There is a bizarre point where Angelica Huston materializes and the moviemakers seem to be striving for some kind of morality play. Just when you expect a dramatic twist and final conflict resolution, the characters turn indecisive and the movie ends. It's really weird. I have seen movies fizzle before, but this one really fizzles!I will say however that the chase is engaging, for the first hour at least."
3,The Makings of a Terrific Film ...,"As this film began, my interest was captured, it kept me glued to my seat, and I never moved for a good hour. The imagery is superb. The actors, spledidly cast. For the genre, it fullfilled all the senses. But just as you're riding along with the main character (Brosnan), you're feeling for him, you're rooting for him, and you're hoping he gets the best of his fierce enemy (Neeson), but you find out that maybe he's getting exactly what he deserves. He did a very, bad, ugly thing, and now you're not sure who to root for. This could have been a great movie, except for that one, final flaw toward the climax. Regardless, you will be entertained. It's packed full of raw, rugged action that will soothe and delight."
3,Very intersting.,It is not what you would expect from a western/revenges story. Very poetic and more than a little abstract in an existential way. The directing/photography is beautiful.
1,Horrible!,"This is the WORST move I have EVER seen. Please don't waste your money! It was hard to sit through 30 mins of this. The graphics were horrible, there was no story line and the actors were soo bad it was comical. I would rather watch a blank TV screen than have to watch this awful movie! So bottom line is, don't buy this movie unless you are trying to purchase the worst movie of all times! :)"
1,Taking advantage of the Zodiac case for a profit,"This movie shouldn't even be for sale. To use the Zodiac case for profit is disgusting. This ""movie"" had nothing what so ever to do with it. If I could give it (-)stars, I would."
1,Absolutely Terrible,This movie is a joke. The acting is atrocious. The cinematography is pathetic. The dialog is pitiful. Do not waste your time and money on this one!
1,Curse of the Zodiac,"I enjoyed reading the book Zodiac and the Hollywood film. This film was three bucks used and i've seen it at a store for the longest time that I eventually picked it up. I knew it wouldn't be too great but didnt expect anything this bad. The seizure inducing camera angles that start off the first five minutes of the film and it continues it thru out. The voice over was beyond horrible; All he did was swear and it kept on looping like it was suppose to be a song. I took this film out before I could finish this movie and it's only an hour and twenty minutes. Stupid, cheap,not worth a peak, and better served as a coaster. Avoid this movie and pick up a book instead."
1,lackluster,"My college just performed this show, and it was starting to grow on me, so I bought this cd. Every performance on the recording is lackluster. The Genevive kind of sounds like Patti LuPone and just slides all her words and notes together. Dominique kills his rhythms in ""Proud Lady."" This cd doesn't even have the better songs on it! I'm saving up to get the London version instead."
4,"Beautiful, Sad and Melancholy","I purchased this album years ago because I was chasing every musical that Patti LuPone was a member of; there's something about her voice.I was surprised at the quality of the recording too. I'd warn anyone purchasing this, the recording is not in stereo and almost sounds tinny in places but I grew to love this sound because I listened to the music beneath it.Traditional French town, a nice traditional story, what better than to have the music sound almost as if it's been lifted out of the period over a stronger version of a grammophone?I like all the songs and it's difficult to choose my most loved one. Chanson speaks so much about life but the song I'd have to choose as my favourite: the melancholy ""If I have to live alone"". I find it so sad and it reminds me of how it feels to be alone and lonely; and listening to it, I want to help the baker too.In all, it's a good CD, just judge it for what it is!"
4,Must Have Schwartz CD,"This is an amazing CD with many great songs for men and women. This has the legendary song Meadowlark. And the men songs Proud Lady and If I Have To Live Alone, are amazing songs to listen to and sing.I gave it 4 stars because it is an older recording which doesn't give you the full effect of these powerful and simple songs as modern day recording techniques would. But this CD is still a great buy with performers: Teri Ralston, Paul Sorvino, Patti LuPone, and Kurt Peterson."
5,Excellent book!,"I was what you would call a ""Noobie"" to all of Garrison's work until recently. I picked up this book at a college library after speaking to my mother about the Minnesota author project I was recently assigned. She was familiar with his work and suggested that I look into it....so I did. I never thought that this would open up such big can of worms, and I mean this in a good sense. After reading the book from cover to cover, I went on the internet to find out more about Garrison's work and turned up some very interesting search results. I then read it again and now I guess you could say that I'm hooked on the Lake Wobegon saga and I am planning on picking up a couple of his earlier writings related to Lake Wobegon.I really enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend this book to anyone who has vast, little, or no knowledge of Lake Wobegon."
4,"nice ""coffee table"" book","this was a gift, so I haven't seen it yet, but I understand it was well recieved and is being enjoyed. This person has every Garrison Keilor book and lived in Minn. so it was perfect..."
2,Nostalgia Failure,"I've plugged this bad boy into my RetroN3 but it's not working. I've even tried the US setting as opposed to the International setting. I don't know what's wrong but my RetroN3 plays every game I have perfectly except for Vortex. Should I have a change of heart or it works, I'll change my mind on this review."
3,Egh,I removed the entire strap and it looks decent that way... but it isn't the greatest shoe. You get what you pay for.
5,Cheaper alternative,"For a much cheaper version that is very similar in overall content, see ""Selected problems in discrete mathematics"" by G. P GavrilovPublisher: Mir Publishers; Rev. from 1977 Russian ed edition (1989), 414 pagesLanguage: EnglishISBN-10: 5030005226"
5,Soliloquey by Vikki Lee,"Vikki Lee is an exceptional talent. Each piece on this album moves brilliantly both lyrically and musically. Vikki's music touches the heart, the head and the spirit, all without skipping a beat. Whether Vikki is writing a ballad, rock and roll or something techno, she is solid and makes it sound easy. But more than that, you will want to listen to the whole album again and again. Vikki, your music continues to fill my heart ~ Eintstein's other daughter"
4,Cover,The item was metal but very thin. If it were being used for what it is actually made for then it is great.
3,Ambitious but flawed,"Despite his stated aim to explore the effects of the War of 1812, Steven Watts' book fails to do so and mainly contributes to the old debate about the war's causes."
5,Ditto--Great Phone,"Kudos for this phone!The Micro SD included fills up pretty quickly, where about tweleve songs filled it up. The micro SD comes with an SD adapter and I bought an SD/USB adapter at CompUSA for about $10.00 and they work great, just like any another expandable memory stick. Songs loaded on the Micro SD need to be placed in the Media folder or the phone won't recognize them.Battery is good considering what the phone does. I purchased a back-up battery for $30.00 plus S+Tax but the phone didn't recognize it and wouldn't work. So I returned it and bought an original battery for about $35.00 plus, and it works great! Better than the one that came with the phone, although they both work fine.The phone functions work fine, pretty standard stuff."
1,POS,"My wife and I each have the Fusic - for 6 months now. She had battery issues right away - it took some time for my phone to develop the same problems. We have both had the batteries changed out, and I'm ready for another..."
1,I hate this phone!!!,This is the worst phone I have ever had! I have had it only for a year and I have replaced it once already because of the battery not working. I am now having to get it replaced for a second time for the same issue. I will have full bars and talk on the phone for 2 minutes and then the phone goes dead! I also don't get my text messages half the time and if I do get them it will be 2 days later when I receive them.
1,Disappointment,"One of the reasons I bought this phone was for the MP3 player. That was a mistake. After loading the player with music on a micro SD card, the player freezes after playing just one song and it has to be restarted. Also, the information about the song, (such as title and genre) does not fully load. I have spent a lot of time tagging my music so it was frustrating when the player showed tagged songs as ""unknown"". Also, the player automatically loads up the ""sprint store"" every time you want to play music, which becomes annoying after a while. Funny, the features to buy music work great. Guess the priorities are clear.This would be less frustrating if the phone excelled in other areas, but friends have remarked that it is hard to hear me when I speak with them using the cell, so even in its core feature fails.Do yourself a favor and find a different phone."
1,Piece of crap,"This item didn't work straight out of the package. I had to hold and push the power cable into the charger to get it to stay on, so I sent it back to the manufacturer as the 'warranty' stated to do. This was about a month ago, and I haven't heard back from them, even after emailing them to find out the status of the repair. Total rip-off."
1,Ultralast CRV3R -- waste of money,Think you are making a green choice buying these batteries? Think again since you will have to throw them away as a hazardous material. They are totally useless.
2,These aren't really flash cards,"I am a DVM student. I bought theses cards to help learn the massive amount of structures necessary for anatomy. I, like other reviewers, found that there was way to much info on each card. I can get a picture with every muscle labeled on it in my dissection guide. I was looking for something that would help to quiz myself by having one or two structures per card. Also I found that the terminology used on the cards is not current with the standard veterinary nomina anatomica. Save your money, these cards aren't worth your time unless you need a very very basic overview."
5,Good rice,"Cheap white rice has no flavor and has no substance. This is good, organic white rice with a nice nutty flavor. It's worth the price if rice is the bulk of the dish you are preparing."
5,Yumiiii and stamped USDA organic,"Tasty and flavored, perfect to cook or make flour, excellent for general purpose. 100% organic, no gmo! Try it you won't be disappointed"
5,Wonderful!,The book and series ate great! Heartwarming and believable. The main characters really touch your heart. Would reccomend the whole series!
5,The storyline really starts moving now,"This disc does more to advance the story of the SuperS series than the last two combined. The Amazon Trio arc ends, the Amazoness Quartet arc begins, and Nehelenia finally puts in a major appearance. This disc also includes the infamous ""nude Ami"" episode (Barbie doll nudity only, but clothesless nonetheless) and some serious Fish Eye air time, so consider yourself warned. Both of these add significantly to the overall story, though, so as long as you're not offended by the concepts you'll be treated to one of the best discs in the series."
5,A Must Read for Every Businessperson,"Having worked with Rusty Rueff at both Frito Lay and Pizza Hut, I knew that he was one of the most creative and strategic HR executives in the industry. This book tells the story of his greatest talent -- finding, developing and retaining talent in a very competitive economy. A compelling story with an easy to use model for developing your Talent Force. A must read for anyone who is interested in taking their business to the next level of performance."
2,A little to small for blow gun.,I purchased these for my grandsons to use in their blow guns but while the regular darts snap into the mouthpiece just fine these paint balls roll out the end if blow gun is pointed down. Not really much use.
5,Awesome US style power metal.,"Rude Awakening are a US style power metal band. Think: the self titled Queensryche ep with Thin Lizzy's sense of melody. The vocals remind me of a cross between Geoff Tate, Midnight, and say John Cyriis. The musicianship is of the highest calibre. If you dig stuff like Seven Witches, Cage, Jag Panzer, Gothic Knights etc., you are sure to enjoy this band. I give this album my highest recommendation."
4,Take Manhattan All The Way,"Sometimes, when a artist intends to cover a song, it just becomes better with another singer, and a bit of age into it. For Joe Cocker, he truly has defined that era of covering nicely. He has covered so many songs, and spun them into his own. This song, First We Take Manhattan is absolutely no acception. The song originally was recorded by Leonard Cohen, but the original version was too much manufactured without a feel of organicness inside. The version Joe Cocker conjured absolutely intends to splash a feel that it is his potent own song ever. It is now found on the Ultimate Collection CD of his, but I strongly suggest you listen to it, if you're a Joe Cocker fanatic. If not, you don't know what you're missing."
4,band of gypsys,"this is the recording where I recognized Jeffrey Lee Pierce was getting his Hendrix on and fully emerging from the shadows of the other guitar players previously tied to him. and in a lot of ways, this new sound changed the focus of the band. the dirty swamp rock and blues, the hoodoo, got replaced by many epic, heroin=laced and magesterial mainlines to oblivion. The howl grew starker and longer, the cry sadder. The fast ones, as time wore on, began to sound clumsy, unfocused and missplaced. Pierce no longer needed the agitation. The pain had been located. The evolution of dissipation ultimately led to the strung-out imaginings of hollowed out ghosts haunting bars in post-war Vietnam in ""Lucky Jim."" That, like the discovery of Kurtz at the end of ""Apocalypse Now,"" is the final evidence that, in the end, there was nothing but miserable, wasteful death. And, sometimes, it may appear beautiful."
5,At this price?,I love Mentos; in fact I am addicted. But this price??????? $20+ for two 1.12 Oz boxes? Each one of these sell for $1.19 at Walgreens!
2,I am not that happy,"I received my fender guitar case , and the case fits my guitar . But its not the same guitarcase shown in the picture....... So I am not that happy"
1,What a disappointment,"Unfortunately, this DVD player is one of the worst purchases I have ever made (excluding the RCA VCR that I purchased at the same time, but that's another review). The first unit failed to run right out of the box, the second failed after two weeks, the the THIRD replacement will only play an average of one out of three DVD's. Why does it read some but not most others? I wish I knew. RCA has pretty much been useless in correcting the problem, and the possible solutions they did offer cost more than I'm willing to pay for a DVD player that has a proven history of failure. Save your money and your sanity, look to another brand name."
1,surged out,"My RCA DVD player lasted less than one year. Evidently a power surge rendered the unit non-functional. A huge disappointment!The warranty is essentially good for 90 days, after that the parts are covered but not the labor. I consider this an almost useless warranty since the substantial charge associated with repairing electronics equipment is the labor.No more RCA for me."
3,"Okay to watch movies, but that's about it.","This will be quick. This DVD player worked well for me for about 2 years, that is for simply watching movies. The picture quality, and menus were really easy to use, and in my opinion the remote, while simplistic was fun and easy to use also. As time passed, and after the purchase of a MP3/Cd player for my car, and my increasing use of CD-R's, it came to my attention that this unit WOULD NOT PLAY MP3 cd's and it would take a miracle for it to read a regular audio CD-R. That's really my only complaint. With the lowering prices of newer dvd players, and increase of features, we should expect more. Anyways, the story ends with my purchasing of a new DVD player, one which does play MP3/CD-r/DVDr's(which I forgot to mention... ha!)."
3,"Good, but not great.","Easy to install, easy to use. User friendly menus, however:1)The player sometimes locks up after you have ejected a disk. The only way to unlock it is to unplug it. 2) The brightness fades in and out as scenes change throughout a movie. Something with the brightness control is not quite right. 3) The remote has now failed after about 2 years of use and we can no longer do anything with the player except play a movie. We can not use the menu at all without the remote, so we cannot view extra features and the like. Overall a decent player, but not reliable in the long run."
1,Don't buy!,I bought this model a little over a year ago. Last week the power supply died; it would cost more to replace it than to buy a new unit.
1,does this player play?????????????????????????????????????,i know this a review forum but i got a quick question does this dvd player play vcds?
1,Keep looking,"My unit began to freeze up after a couple of weeks. Since this only happened on rented DVD's at first, I decided to keep it. Well, after 3 months of light use, the unit began to freeze up on all DVD's, new or used. Eventually, within 4 months, it would not even read any DVD or CD.I called RCA to get it repaired under warranty (no toll-free number), and the ONLY option that was offered was to replace the unit at a cost of $89.95. I did this and the new unit works ok so far, but it is noisy when reading disks.If you do some research on the net, you'll notice that many others have experienced similar problems. In short, this is an unreliable unit that is not backed very well by the manufacturer."
5,A MUST READ,"This is the first Pike book I've ever read. And this book is a must read. I enjoyed it very much. Once you start reading this, you wont be able to put it down. There is a surprise waiting on every page you turn (: The murderer was the last person I thought it would be. This book is very exciting and leaves you wondering. There is a huge twist at the end. The end was okay for me. But I didn't find the end very satisfying. But overall, the book was very good. For any fans of Pike, this is a must read. Hope you enjoy (:"
4,This book is very suspensful and will keep you guessing.,"I recommend this book because it is very good and I think that kids of the age twelve and older would really like this book. It talks about how people are not always what they seem to be. In one scene in the story Ann always thought that Chad was a very nice person. Then he started saying things like, ""Everything you think I think,"" and, ""I knew your plan before you knew it. I gave it to you Ann."". This book is very suspenseful and interesting. It will keep you guessing. If you like reading these kinds of books I suggest you read Christopher Pike's ""Fall Into Darkness"""
4,Don't get persuaded not to read the book because of the movi,really good.well written and lots of suspense
5,la creme de la creme - the best of the best,"Mr. Pike has really done it this time! this books is awesome, one of the best of his books. No wonder it's been made into a mvie starring teen heart throb Jon Brandis.Anne hats her best friend, because Anne's brother killed himeself because Sharon didn't like him back (or did he?). Anne sets up Sharn for her own murder, so that while Anne's away in some retreat with her boyfriend, Sharon will be in jail. But did Jerry(anne's bro) kill himself? Or does Chad (Anne's boyfriend's bro) know more that he lets on.Read it to find out. It's definitely worth buying."
5,A Fantastic Suspense Thriller,I really enjoyed reading this excellent book! It's one of my absolute favourite books. It has everything from murder to mystery to romance. If you love thrillers and suspense then you'll enjoy it as much as I did!
1,Totally not for me,"All right, this book really sucked. It started out as good for me but eventually, I got bored with the plot and it was really easy to figure out who the killer was."
5,another fabulous book by christopher pike,"This book is just so fab! I first started reading Christopher Pike books two years ago, because I love mysteries. It was Goosebumps books for me at the age of 10, then other R.L.Stine books, then Christopher Pike, I'm 14 now. Every book I read, I just can't put down! Christopher Pike creates the most amazing atmospheres, plots, and ideas. This book was exceptionally good, it's in my top three books by him (if he is a male, could be a pen name). You already know what it's about from the other reviews and things, so all I can say is go out and read it! I would totally luv to see the movie, Jonathan Brandis is a babe! He's even born on my brother's bday. But because this is Australia, I aint seeing the movie, and all our book covers look totally diff from USA's. I just *wuv* this book heaps... - Calli"
4,Childhood favorite,"At ten, I was a voracious reader who often complained about the mystery books geared for kids my age. I usually figured the endings out very early on, which deflates the entire story, no matter how well developed the characters are.I had an uncle with a similar passion for books; we often read together. He was a huge fan of mystery, especially Stephen King, and he harbored a hope that Christopher Pike would help prepare me for King's work when I was older. He found out about Christopher Pike from one of our public librarians and, that winter, when a bad case of strep throat kept me home from school, he promptly went to the bookstore and purchased this book.I fell in love with the author immediately - because I couldn't guess the ending to this book. I was so blown away that I immediately spent most of my allowance on purchasing other books by Pike."
5,Best Book Ever,"this was the best book i've ever read. I don't like reading books as much, but this one really caught my attention."
5,Beautifully writen. Amazing plot.,The plot of the book kept me gripping each page with excitment (like all of Christopher Pike's books) and reading this thrilling novel over and over again
2,Warped Cards,"I've read a lot of stories about how USPC Kems warp easily, so I decided to get some pre-USPC Kems hoping that they would be more warp-resistant. Lo and behold, these arrived warped!!! I am returning it immediately, and I don't think I will be buying Kems again. I'll stick with Copags (which have their own problem with the paint fading too quickly, but nothing as serious as warping)."
4,Satisfied with KEM cards,The KEM cards looked just as they did online and are of very good quality. The container/box is adequate though nothing special.
2,Untimely,I ordered the fiddlestix lacrosse set on December 8th but did not receive until after the first of the year. I would Highly recommend finding you purchase someplace else.
5,SATISFIED,Radio-controlled WatchThis the second Lacrosse Atomic Watch I have purchased. The old one still operates OK & so does the new one. I recomend this watch to anyone wanting a completly accurate timepiece.
2,Huge,"This watch is just so cheap looking and huge.. the picture lies! You think you are getting some nice silver looking watch, what you get is a big plastic lump on your hand that looks rediculous. Don't take my word for it, buy one. They are so cheap it wont put a hole in your pocket. I guarantee you wont want to wear it though."
5,Great Buy at discounted price - go for it!,"I was a little apprehensive because of some of the negative reviews but decided to throw it into my shopping cart when I was buying some other things on Amazon.This is an excellent watch at the discounted price and a great buy. Its a basic watch...just tells you the time. Hour minute and second plus the day, month and date.No other features. But I never used those extra features on my other watches. I miss having no backlight. In low light the time is difficult to read. I wish the numerals were thicker on the display.Its a very attractive watch. Silver with a metallic stretch band. Its light weight. It tells you the exact time, exactly. It looks good. At the price its now selling on Amazon, I would recommend this watch as a good buy. If you have kids, they will love it guaranteed and show it off to their friends. But its also a good watch for adults. Its basically a men's watch."
2,Nice watch if worked,After one month I had to send this watch back to the manufacturer. It stopped getting the signal and ran 1 minute fast. Although it looks cheap if it kept accurate time it would be ok
4,La Crosse Stretch Band Watch,The watch is great! only wish it had a way to see its face in the dark.The watch stretch band broke right away and a replacement link cost me $12.95
1,"M R Hussaini (Schaumburg, IL USA)","Online it looks fine. When I have seen it I really felt very very bad, frustrated. How could any one make such product. It looks ugly. I never seen such a urgly item in my life. I thought to buy some more products from Amezon but when I have seen this product I stopped. I do not want to buy any thing from this site. I could have return back but I thrown out.La Crosse Technology WT-967SML Atomic Digital Watch with Stretch Band"
3,For kids?,"I like this watch, but even though I have just an average sized wrist, I found this thing very uncomfortable to wear. What I found curious and odd is that when I went to their website to register the product, one of the options I found was to order a new band for the watch. Maybe they're making more money on the replacement bands than on the watch itself.BTW, I never got through the registration process and have not ordered a new band."
2,Cheaply Made,"The band is cheap metal and broke for me after a couple of weeks. The housing for the watch face looks like metal on this site, but it's actually plastic. Aside from the spiffy factor that it talks to atomic clocks, this watch is much worse quality than a 5 dollar timex from target|wal-mart."
2,Cheapy Atomic Watch Basic Only,This is a basic watch with Atomic setting. I bought it at the $20 Gold box special price. Don't pay more. It does not have back light and no other features except time and date display. The wrist band does not adjust. I do not have thick wrists (6 ft tall) and the band is tight and has to stretch a little while sitting on my wrist. Nice thing is it does not rip off my arm hair. If you have thicker wrists it will be in a tight stretched position. The display is nice but has no back light. If it had backlight I'd be happy at the 20 dollars. Feel I bought a toy watch with automatic atomic setting.
2,"A cheap atomic digital watch, but the stretch watch band is horrible","This atomic digital watch costs about $10. It gives accurate reading of the ""time of day clock"" down to seconds.However, the metallic stretch band is horrible! To put it on, I always get pinched. It is intolerable to the point that I had to buy a leather replacement watch band. So, my net cost went up to $18!"
3,"This is *not* a Sekou Diabate recording, but...","This recording is of Sékouba Bambino, a fine young singer. He has somehow been confused with Sékou Bembeye Diabate, also known as Diamond Fingers, who does happen to play a little bit of guitar on this CD, and was also a member of Bembeya Jazz with Sékouba Bambino. Perhaps the name similarity is why there is some confusion? Nevertheless, while some of the production on this CD is synth-laden and perhaps too Euro for some, the singing is very good, and spirit is correct. And some later tracks are rootsy and more vital. Have a listen to the sound files and see what you think. I bought it on the basis of these files and have enjoyed it, even if my hero, Diamond Fingers, is not the headliner."
4,Reference bibliography,This is an essential bibliography as a reference to introducing students for the Plant Pathology science.
5,EMPOWERED BY PRAISE,This book is so powerful that it is the second time I have studied it. My opinion is that it is a very necessary read for a Christian.
4,Very good aid to personal workship,"Recommended for those who want to learn about the various ""names"" for God and how that can shape our personal prayer time as well as personal workship. MIchael Youssef is a wonderful author.Gary Woodie"
4,OK,"I haven't read thru yet, but it seems like an ok book. I've seen better, and of course worse....okJust ok"
3,About Time a Vegan Admitted that Soy Isn't Perfect,"This is a most unusual cookbook for vegans. The author actually acknowledges that most vegans eat too much soy. And it's not just an allergy issue. How so? Since she doesn't go into this enough, I will. Soy screws up hormones -- all those plant estrogens plus xeno estrogens in the environment makes for a double whammey. Even causes infertility, and CNN just announced a British study about how it hurts sperm. It wipes out the thyroid -- happened to me. That means lousy energy and putting on the pounds. Hard on the digestion -- cramps and gas. Vegans absolutely must read ""The Whole Soy Story: The Dark Side of America's Favorite Health Food."" Instead, most just get angry. Be glad that Dreena isn't pushing soy."
5,Great Cookbook!,"I bought this cookbook about 2 weeks ago and have since made several recipes out of it, all of which have turned out great. My favorite is the canellini bean and yam hummus, which is SO good that I could eat it daily. This is a great cook book for anyone, whether youre a new vegan, longtime vegan, lazy vegan or not vegan at all. The recipes in the book are for the most part simple, dont rely too heavily on soy and dont require the use of really obscure ingredients. I also like that most recipes are wheat free or have wheat free options. This cookbook is definitely going into my rotation."
2,FOR THE REAL TEMPTATION FANS,"THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY MUSIC WAS GREAT,BUT THE TEMPTS HAVE A ALBUM CALLED THE TEMPTATIONS LIVE AT LONDONS, TALK OF THE TOWN.IT HAS EDDIE, DENNIS, PAUL, MELVIN, & OTIS,ON STAGE DOING ALL THE GREAT TEMPTATION SONGS ,WITH STRONG LEAD VOCALS AND THEIR BEAUTIFUL BACKGROUND HARMONYS. ALSO THEY HAVE AN CD CALLED THE ANTHOLOGY WHICH HAS 46 TEMPTATION HITS. IT IS VERY VERY GOOD, IT ALSO HAS SOME LIVE RECORDINGS ON IT.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ALL TEMPTATION LOVERS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM TRY TO FIND THEM.IT WILL BE WORTH THE SEARCH.ONE MORE THING THE TEMPTATIONS HAVE A CD CALLED 25TH ANNIVERSARY WHICH IS ANOTHER GREAT GREAT COLLECTIONFIND THEM ALL IF YOU CAN."
2,Better Collections Avavilable Elsewhere,"Ultimate Collection and Anthology are better buys for the money. Where is that wonderful Tempts-Four Tops ""battle"" that appeared on the 25th Anniversary special???"
2,"Come on now Fred, you can do better.","If you want a big name draw, and lots of old pictures meant to impress rather than inform, than this is your book. This book seemed like it was rushed and not at all put together as well as others I have seen. Although Beckey is undoubtably a climbing guru around these parts, I have never associated his name with Rainier. As for the other author, I am sure he is quite qualified at writing a guide for the one route he ""sheepherds"" clients up in the summer, but heck I could regurgitate route descriptions from other books also. After reading this book I was left wondering whether or not somebody's savings account was rapidly dwindling and needed immediate damage control. This book will get you by, but when lives are on the line I want the best, and this folks ain't it."
2,older book,I would get a newer book if I was going to this area. Some nice climbing reports and beta so
3,Spiritual connotations,"I should say that the book is very well done but it has too much spiritual connotations, specially using the Bible as its main source. If the Bible and other religious book does not ring a bell to you, forget this book. It it like there is no mirror. It is like reading Jung's "" Psychology and Oriental Regilion"". Jung travels to the East trying to find his own references from the West point of view. If you think about the new Positive Psychology, forget the book."
4,cant wait,i remember seeing the first episode loved it and a lil scary but still love i cant wait until it comes out !!!!!!
1,"Awesome, But Short Lived","I bought one and it shipped pretty fast, and was AMAZING to play with for the first day but after that it stopped working. String gets caught every minute. It's kind of cheap."
5,International Marketing 14th Edition,"The International Marketing 14th Edition by Philip Cateora, Mary C. Gilly and John L. Graham I purchased from Amazon was a great value. The book was brand new and delivered in a timely manner.The the book provides a wealth of information on International Marketing by providing tools necessary for modes of analysis, within existing and emerging markets internationally."
3,"Decent book, poor price","This title covers the history of all three of Florida's Seminole Wars in average detail. Illustrated with period artwork, the format is somewhat similar to an Osprey publication, without the color plates. Because the book touches upon all three of the wars, the detail given to each is sorely lacking. This is more of a cursory examination of the Seminole troubles, more suited to the neophyte than the buff. Mahon's Second Seminole War is still the best title for that conflict, and there are other titles that cover the First Seminole War (Heidler and Heidler's Old Hickory's War comes to mind).If the book was not so pricey, it would be a good introduction to the Seminole issue. However, at it's current price tag one is better trying to find it used."
2,Shame on Swarovski.,"I ordered this for my wife, but was received with the display box cracked & split open. I know its just a display case which won't be used, but still when you pay a premium for a Limited Edition product..you simply expect higher quality and presentation. The hair dryer looked decent, but no real ""wow"" factor.Amazon quickly refunded me the entire amount. Excellent service on their part!"
2,Lack of accessories hurts,"I got this hair dryer for my wife and unfortunately the only accessory you can ever attach to it is the one it comes with. She has to have a hair pick and connair flatout said no pick will attach to this.She loved the design though, if that means anything (IE placement of buttons and whatnot)"
2,"Good dryer, shoddy packaging.","The dryer is an excellent dryer, works well looks very nice with the gems.However, when this arrived, the wooden presentation box was cracked in several places. I would have returned it for a replacement, but it was purchased for a gift and I did not have time. I took the dryer out of the box and wrapped it in a gift bag instead.From the looks of it, the wooden box was not cracked from shipping, but was actually manufactured out of poorly dried wood and simply dried and shrank at different rates. While the dryer is fine, it kind of spoiled the whole ""limited edition"" effect to have to throw out the box. Really a shame."
2,Got Brookies?,"With this small reel and either my sectional or telescoping Shakespeare rod, the combination is perfect for fishing for brook and rainbow trout in Rocky Mountain beaver ponds. Just break down the rod and place the whole thing in the bottom of my tackle box and hit the trail.Only reason I didn't give this one 5 full stars is for the long lasting quality of the reels. Yeah, for less than ten bucks, they don't last forever. A few of the plastic parts will wear out eventually. No big deal, just buy another reel every 3 or 4 years, at $9, it's a steal.UPDATED: MAY 2011I've since stopped buying these reels. Seems the last couple, they quit working right much sooner. From 4-stars, I've dropped it to 2-stars, and I'me back to buying Zebco reels."
4,"Best gay guide to Paris, even though it's out of print.","This far and away my favorite gay guide to Paris. The author has a real gift for capturing and describing the true atmosphere of the various haunts (bars, restaurants, saunas, cafes, museums, hotels, community center) that you might visit on a trip to the city. I especially appreciate his attitude towards the sexual possibilities of a trip to Paris -- his tone is neither leering nor ashamed, and he clearly contemplates a little sexual adventure as a normal part of a visit to Gay Paris.It's a shame that this book has been out of print for so long -- any publisher who would buy the title and pay for an update would do a great service to gay travellers. Despite the fact that some of the information in the book is out of date, I still rely on it each time I go to Paris."
2,LP is source for Ports of Pleasure,"Okay, I have the reel to reel of PORTS OF PLEASURE and it beats the pants off of the LP source used on this CD release. Somewhere on the package they should warn consumers that this is most likely not an officially licensed release of this music. Avoid it until either Capitol or Collector's Choice Music release it proplerly. I gave it two stars simply becuase it can serve the purpose of introducing people to Les' music, even if on a less than satisfactory LP transfer to CD."
3,"Recording is distorted, likely due to poor mastering!","I have about a dozen Les Baxter CD's, and most of them contain two albums' worth of material. The music on this CD is just as wonderful as all the rest of Les Baxter's recordings. However, this CD contains much distortion (clipping). Apparently whoever mastered this disc was asleep or down at the corner pub. What a crime to do this to such great music."
4,A magic journey,"Put the Cd on and embark on a magic journey of lush harmonies, delightful melodies and exotic rythms. This is the magic of Les Baxter! My dad was a fan of Baxter's and I picked it up myself from him. I only wish Capitol/EMI would embark on a full-fledged reissue of all Baxter's albums. I miss his other exotica titles on Cd, especially ""Caribbean Moonlight"", a wonderful album, represented by only three tracks on Capitol's great compilation ""The Exotic Moods of Les Baxter"". About the current Cd, although a definite 5 stars for Baxter, the remaster obviously comes from an LP, and it seems not a very good one at that: the overall acoustics are reverberant and there is signs of end-of-side distortion and saturation on certain tracks. The Cd is nicely presented and I must recommend it for the marvelous music it contains in spite of the technical reservations that can be easily be lived with for the time being."
2,real estate class,I purchased this calculator for real estate class to help me with math.the info on how to use it is to short and not to much detail to understand with first time user.if you are having problems with math do not purchase.
5,I like it!..,"This my third qualifier plus purchase. (I lost the other two lol). Excellent calculator and a must have for the RE, or mortgage Broker...."
5,The whole family loves this Santa,"I originally bought this as a gag gift but when I showed it to my husband and daughters, they all had a great time laughing. My husband didn't want to give it away. I did, but he insisted I buy another one to keep and even when I was putting away all the Christmas decorations, I had to play 'Pull my finger farting Santa', again and again. This is a fun item to have around."
2,not reliable,The finger switch broke after only having it for a week and very little usage. Would not recommend this product.
1,Junk,Work for about 1 minute and quit. Took it apart to find the problem which was a broken wire. All wires were flimsy and easy to break. Work for anothey few minutes and stopped. I promptly put it in the trash!
5,My daughter loved her Christmas!,This was a gift for my daughter - she was so excited to see these dvd's!
5,House,"Excellent! If you like dry wit, sarcasm, sometimes cruel humor, and t.v. medical drama then this is for you. Very funny and intriguing, makes you forget they solve life threatening diseases overnight. Good deal on the two seasons."
4,house m.d. seasons one and two,I enjoy this program - missed a few - so now I will be able to watch any time I want.
5,Awesome,"This is a great deal for both Seasons of ""House"". I am a late starter on watching ""House"" so am glad to be able to catch up with Season 1 &2. If you are a fan of ""House"" I recomend these DVDs."
4,House DVDS Season One & Two,"Only problem I had with these was with Season One. It was only a three disk set with shows on both sides, and for some reason, my DVD player had a difficult time recognizing ""Side B"". It kept telling me there was no playable disk in the player, so I had to keep trying over and over until finally it would play. (Season Two is six separate disks so maybe they figured that problem out after enough people complained??) It was annoying because the show itself ROCKS. Other than that, everything was fine."
5,"House MD, enjoyed every minute","Earlier this year, I got hooked on watching the TV show, so I rented the first season DVD's. After watching them, I needed to have both season one and two so I purchased them through Amazon, where I make 90% or more of my DVD purchases because they always have the best deals."
4,Cher Marks The Millennium,"Cher's griity vocals and sassy attitude mark the new Century on this memory evoking disc. All digitally re-mastered, these tracks take us back in time when music was *soda pop giggles* and *mimosa smiles*.From the tambourine storytelling chimes of ""Gypsies, Tramps, & Thieves"" to the emotional coupling of ""All I Ever Need Is You""--a duet with Sonny Bono, this is a sexy, soulful, fun compilation.Cher is always reinventing herself--the longevity chameleon of the music industry. A recommended addition for ""best of"" collections.Thanks for your interest & comment votes--CDS"
1,Cher's Best I don't think so,"This album is very disappointing, most of the songs are so far from Cher's best. I would be embarrassed to call it my best. Seems like a cheap way for a record company to make a buck. But then again I've yet to enjoy any 20th Century Masters Collection. Its as if these are Public Domain Songs. Sorry Cher, 1 Star"
2,Bestop 53121-37 Spice Fabric Replacement Upper Door Skin,"The inside of the door is grey, rather than spice color, and does not match the rest of the vehicle. This should have been noted in the product description."
3,Almost Thailand,"Do we read this to read good stories or to get closer to Thailand? Since fiction by Thais in English is in short supply, Khun Rattawut's collection presents a rare opportunity. Happily, the stories are engaging and well written.And yet, the stories seem not quite Thai. Certainly they sound Thai and the situations often seem Thai, but at a deeper level, they are not Thai. In these regard the stories are disappointing.Still, Sightseeing is an enjoyable read."
3,juvenile,"I notice there are no Thais raving about this book. Like Rattawut, I've spent some time state-side, so i know what the score is. But I dont think these reviewers have got a clue. Rattawut's characters are shallow, and the kind of thing any Beach-goer could've thought up. The device of the slippery pig as a metaphor of Thais escaping the farangs (in ""farang"")was just too crass to be true. Even on page one the mother wasnt having a conversation, she was making a soliloquy. OK for Shakespeare but not cool for a modern so-called realistic novel."
3,starts good but....,this starts out great but takes a time jump in the middle and lost me for quite a bit..It was good while it lasted
2,OK,"This is intended for the very young, beginning Spanish student. You could get all this book contains by Googling for free materials on the internet."
4,Nice workbook for beginners,"I am currently using this workbook with my beginning Spanish students. Although designed for very young students, the activities can be used with any age level. It is colorful and easy to use. It does what it should do very well, the only difficulty is that it may appear too childish for middle-schoolers. (Mine haven't complained too much!)"
4,Great supplemental worksheets for Spanish teachers,"This is a WONDERFUL book for teachers to pull from when they need more worksheets or ideas to give a spin on the topic of the day in their Spanish class.If you don't know Spanish and are trying to teach your child Spanish, it might be a little less than helpful - there's no phonetic spelling - just a lot of great review, wonderful pictures, and this thing is HUGE! It has tons of categories from Numbers, letters, colors, food, etc and even has flashcards and games in the back to cut out. It's full-color and my children really enjoy just looking at it, even though they can't read yet (they're all under four.) I agree on its age range of first -third grade. If you have younger kids, you probably need a CD as well. For elementary review, this is WONDERFUL for summer, or anytime!Sra. GoseAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 & Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 2"
4,Good Spanish Introduction for Kids,"We like this book very much. It helps make Spanish practice/review easier...HOWEVER it is NOT for someone who does not know how to pronounce words in Spanish. I have taken Spanish from high school through college (unfortunately, I am not yet fluent), so my son is familiar w/ pronounciation. I could not imagine trying to educate a child with this book alone if they are not already familiar with Spanish pronounciation (or at least have someone available for reference). Also, I am frustrated that helpful flash""cards"" are made out of flimsy paper instead of card stock (common w/ Amer. Ed. Publishing). Arrrggghhh!!! I would give a 5 if that change was made..."
4,Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist,"`Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' follows Nick and Norah on one wild night in New York as they drive around trying to find a secret gig by a band called Wheres Fluffy?. Nick is trying to get over a broken relationship and Norah is being used by her ex and together they find a bit of romance and fun whilst listening to a pretty great soundtrack. This started off quite slow but soon had me chuckling out loud, especially at Norah's drunk friend, Caroline, who they lose and have to track down. This is a gentle film with no great surprises, but it is pretty good romantic comedy with out being too soppy or `chick flick`. Nick's friends are comical and the cast in general are fun to watch. At just under 90 minutes this isn't too long and makes for an easy going way to spend an evening, it's genuinely funny in parts and will leave you with a warm glow by the end.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,Just read the book,"So I actually became interested in reading this book after seeing the previews for the movie but I was never interested in seeing the movie until I read the book. Confusing, I know. I found the book to be much better than the movie. I can appreciate where the movie is trying to go but there was much less substance than the book. I did like how the movie portrayed the character of Norah. She seems just as genuine as her character in the book; however, I feel Nick's character got short-changed in the movie in favor of focusing on the supporting characters who played very minor roles in the book but were giving more screen time than necessary. Overall, if I saw this movie without ever even knowing about the book, I would have found it cute and endearing but having read the book, I was left wanting more."
1,This is the worst movie I've ever seen!,"This movie is meant for teenagers as the song by the The Who ""Teenage Wasteland"" which they are. I am an indie film director and producer and this is terrible the writing, the humor. all of it! the girl in the movie is down right nasty. vomits. drops her phone like a F-wit and picks it up (I'm so sure the phone will still work in a toilet of vomit) on top of that. she's grossed out in the beginning to get the phone out. but, no. she's not when she gets her gum she droped and puts it back into her mouth. NOBODY DOES THAT! STUPID AND LAME! glad Judd Apatow didn't direct it! this guy Phil should be fired."
2,Are these the people that will be running the country???,Yow! ACTUAL DEADHEADS! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY!!Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist
4,Car Trip,This is the perfect CD for a car trip. It is a good combination of Indie Rock songs that go great together. Just sit back relax and enjoy the music.
2,It was a bit too... bad...,"I love music and like romantic comedies, but this movie just got a bit too provocative for me. It was funny at first, but it just became too much. I liked the soundtrack and i liked the story for the most part. It was just not a movie to watch with your family."
4,WELL DONE TEEN COMEDY WITH HEART AND A BRAIN!,"I usually expect the worst from these types of films, but I must admit there have been some really good ones in the past few years. 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' is sharp and funny; despite knowing where it's going to end. Even with a likeable cast and cool soundtrack(which always helps these films out); this film can hold its own because of its wit and charm."
2,"Not the dumbest teen comedy ever made, but close","It's not funny at all. In fact, it made me cringe throughout. Stupid, pointless, disgusting (referring mainly to the journey of the piece of gum). It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because I did watch it all the way through, and it's stuck in my mind enough that there must be something effective about it."
2,another teen movie...,"Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist is a bland movie based on a young adult novel. Michael Cera is amusing but the film is full of cliches, bad acting and silly dialogue. Even the soundtrack is annoying."
1,awful,"The whole movie tries to be this exciting high school kids running wild and free. But the whole thing felt so boring, No iconic moments. Not funny or orig. Very boring and down right gross."
1,Nice try but save your money,I wasn't to into this movie. The story line was bland and the acting was overall boring.How can so much be done in New York in one night? I like how there is no crowds and everyone drives in the city with no traffic. I lived in New York for 3 years never have I seen this open streets like this.The story goes no where what a dud for the Michael Cera. I hope you read this learn to drive on Sunset Blvd in Hollywood you looked like a idoit.
1,Bad movie.,"We love cool, quirky movies with witty dialogue such as Juno and Little Ms. Sunshine. This is one of those movies that is recycled trash cashing in on that ""Indy feel"" of genre, that appeals to teenagers. It's such a formula movie, that it feels like Disney wrote it. Lets make the lead character a nerdy, guitar playing ,emo, punk staight edge, emo-gay, artistic-yet mis understood, but not so cool, yet cool guy finding the coolest band in town in NYC. The story is so bad, they need to throw in the teenage ""gross-shock, sex, drunk-chick recipe"" for the young teenage crowd to distract them from the horrible writing."
3,"Comme ci, comme a","The Bottom Line:There are some sweet moments in Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist and the casting of two likable leads certainly goes a long way towards making the film a success, but there are also some inexplicably bad moments (the vomit and the gum--why?) and a feeling that more could have been made of the film; I left the theater reasonably pleased but it didn't hold up well in retrospect so exercise caution before plunking down any cash for this one.2.5/4"
3,Cute,"Some funny parts, but nowhere near as funny as Cera's other movies. Was hoping for more focus on the music, but the songs picked were lackluster. Cute with corny lines."
3,The other scariest toilet...,"The genre of the sarcastic really deep womanteen is in full swing, and is no less represented in this flick. Not bringing anything new to its female lead, Cera is equally as predictable in yet another loveable goofy guy role. As long as you're OK with that sort of setup you won't be let down by this film. It's cute with a few funny moments from the Queercore Trio."
4,So Sweet!,"I love this movie! It is not your everyday, mainstream type of film. It is one of those that gets better the more you watch it. Hilarious all around. Nora's girl friend is ""pee your pants funny."" My favorite is the progression of the life of her gum... I won't spoil it - You have to see it. If you liked Juno at all, and like Michael Cera, you will have fun. This is a connoisseur's choice; have to add it to your library."
3,"Light, but entertaining","Light, fun teen-romance comedy. The only thing that annoyed me was the fact that the leads are supposed to be high-school students, but talk and act like they're 10 years older. I mean, how do 17-year-olds go clubhopping in NYC on a regular basis, at least often enough where they know everyone and everyone seems to knows them? Not to mention the loser musician that is dating the jailbait-aged Norah. Despite these questions (and others), if you don't think about it too much, and just sit back and relax, it's an enjoyable movie to watch, and it was the perfect flick to watch on an airplane, as I did."
2,I was disappointed in this product.,"Even though it is a Master Lock product, it is very small and easy to crack open by those who would like to. Lock is very small and not a good buy for the money. So, too high-priced. The two-star rating mainly reflects the quality of Amazon accessability and fulfullment and good packaging and branding by Master Lock. Look for something else bigger and cheaper."
1,Cheap. Don't Buy,I had a really hard time setting the code and the body of the lock is made out of cheap plastic. Wouldn't recommend it.
1,Lock was broken in the gym,"Bought this lock and used it in the gym locker. Due to the narrow U-shaped part, the lock was broken in the gym. (I was lucky none of my belongings were stolen.) If you're looking for something sturdier and which will not break easily, this is not the lock for you."
1,Master Lock 4680DLBK TSA,"If this tsa lock doens't come with a key, why is their a key slot on top? John"
3,TSA broke it open,I bought this lock to meet the TSA regulations.Unfortunately the lock was gone when I arrived at my destination.All I found was a TSA notice they had inspected the bag and broke the lock.Maybe they didn't know how to open it...
2,There are much better locks than this,"If your goal is to keep things closed and have a visual theft deterrent, this is probably fine. As far as actually provinding protection, this lock can be easily defeated with the smallest of hack saws. The shank does not even lock into the body of the lock - it just dead-ends into a 2mm deep bowl on the top of the lock. Also, the three number combination can easily be cracked - when you realize that numbers on either side of the number selected are also triggered. That is, if you need to select 4, both 3 and 5 will also work.Finally, as stated below, this lock is lacking the ability to see if the TSA opened your bag.On the plus side, the set your own combination feature worked fine."
3,"Too heavy, but Heavy Duty.","The lock is heavy duty, good if you are worried about someone breaking your lock. I, personally, found it to be too heavy to use. It would slowly move my zippers down as I was moving about in the airport. Ended up buying a lighter lock since I mainly use it to keep my zippers closed, and keep my valuables safe from chamber-maids."
4,Shank could be longer,My previous lock had a longer shank which I really miss. Otherwise this lock is fine quality.Note that you dont get to select the color that you want.
2,Cheap,Incredibly easy to defeat. I guess ya need to spend more than $5 on a decent lock. 3 more words.
4,TSA Lock from Master Lock,"Works well.I just wish the TSA agents would place it back on (or at least inside) the checked bag.The TSA agents take or ""misplace"" approximately 50% of my TSA-approved suitcase locks.It gets expensive when you travel as much as I do."
3,Needed for travel.,"The locks are easy to code, and do the trick of preventing quick unzips of the luggage, but of the two locks like this I purchased, only one is still intact. Enough of a jolt or a twist on a luggage conveyor, and they fall apart. Either that, or the TSA couldn't find the correct key for this particular lock and decided to twist it off."
5,"Durable, easy to set/operate","I use these locks for travel as well as soft-case firearms transport.They've held up well and are easy to set and operate. I fell like they'll do their job of keeping out anyone nosey.Its not going to stop the Mission Impossible team from breaking in.For the money, they're great.Recommended."
4,Good Lock,"I bought two for my checked luggage, they worked just like they should and there really isn't much more to say."
4,1 out of 3 defective,"Bought 3 of these locks. Two were perfect, super easy to set. Third lock felt funny from the start. Curved lock piece felt stiff and would not spin properly so I could not set my combination. Thanks to amazon for being so great with the return of this single lock. I love you guys:)"
4,TSA approved lock does the job,"Your basic lock with no frills and, thankfully, no surprises. Went to India and back via Zurich and used them on multiple baggage. Worked fine, though one was missing when I got back to New York. Nice brushed metal finish."
1,Easy to pick,My son picked the lock in under a minute. I was shocked and he was amused that I bought a cheap lock and expected it to be secure. I guess I won't buy a combination lock in the future. I still used the locks on international trips and they served their purpose Don't get them if you plan to leave bags unattended and want them secure.
1,It worked for a while ...,It worked great for dozens of trips. But it quit working this weekend - I now have a locked suitcase. The combination no longer works and I will have to use a hacksaw to remove it. It is a good thing that I am at home and not on a vacation. If I were on vacation I would probably have to cut the suitcase open because I wouldn't have a hacksaw!
1,Busted ~,I ordered 2 locks. The first one worked fine but I wasn't able to set the code for the 2nd lock. It was a piece of junk. I should've gone and purchased from a a luggage store. It's not worth the effort sending it back for a refund. I'm pitching it. I hope the one lock that does work will continue to work. It was a Christmas present to my son who travels a lot so I was disappointed.
4,Good solid lock -- fits the Pelican 1450 and 1500,I wanted a small combination lock with user-settable combination that fits the Pelican 1450 and 1500 waterproof cases. These locks do the job very nicely. They appear to be well made and it is very easy to set the combination. My only complaint about these locks was the packaging; it was quite difficult to extract the lock from the plastic bubble container.Recommended. RJB.
3,"""Christmas with the Big Band""","Vocalist Gary Grant leads a big jazz band in the standard ""Winter Wonderland"" and a lesser known, but very entertaining ""Zat You Santa Claus?"" The latter also showcases an uncredited plunger trumpet solo that deserves recognition. ""Let it Snow,"" the CD bonus track, is a duet between Grant and pianist/arranger Mike Petrone."
5,lil cease is aweson,i love this album..i listen constantly..his lyrics are stunning and amazing beats..u wont be disappointed when u get this..cease is a genius..u should really listen to what he tells you..its amazing lyrics..i cannot stress how good this is
5,Truly A Blessing,"Jamellah Ellis has hit the ground running with her debut novel That Faith, That Trust, That Love. Her comfortable writing style will make you want to laugh, cry and call a friend to recommend that they read it, all at the same time.Ellis deftly weaves together the stories of three generations of African-American women, each dealing with the same issues in their different ways. From Ma Grand's ""never let 'em see you sweat"" demeanor to Pam's ""put on a happy face"" attitude to Marley's determination to live life to the fullest but by her own rules, Ellis shows us that only God can bring true happiness, not the things we do or say to try and find it.Unlike some ""sistagirl"" books on the market, Ellis' male characters are vivid and true to life, showing the good, the bad and the ugly. Her female supporting characters (Marley's sistergirls Ashley, Deanna and Lynne) are strong enough to each carry a book by themselves.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I for one would love to see a sequel!"
5,Wonderful read,"New author Jamellah Ellis has written a heartwarming and uplifting Christian tale. Marley Shephard is a young beautiful woman who appears to be living on top of the world. She has a loving and supportive circle of family and friends. She is engaged to a handsome man. And she has a wonderful job. So, you wonder what could be missing from her life. GOD is missing. Marley has put God on the back burner. The day Marley opens her life and heart to God everything changes for the better. She is able to face life challenges head on because God is walking with her. With God all things are possible.This novel comes highly recommended. Best Wishes and God's Blessings to Jamellah."
3,A fine debut novel,"If you've been avoiding the new Christian novels because you thought they would be too sweet or too simple run to the bookstore and buy That Faith, That Trust, That Love. It is a fine novel about a beautifully written character who faces a tough problem and finds the answer in Jesus. Check this one out. You will be pleased that you did.Kimberley Wilson, author of 11 Things Mama Should Have Told You About Men."
3,fast pace but slow ending,"the story was fast almost to fast with the order of events.marley definitely has a lot in common with todays single black female but she was lacking so much spiritually. i often thought is she more into worshipping god or lazuraus.i didn't laugh much although i never stopped reading. it was really about pam once i thought about it, i would recommend this to a travelor. done before you know it."
5,Truly wonderful,"After reading this remarkable tale I was forced to look within myself and decide it was definately time to...Let GO and Let GOD. I have always been a believer in the adjunct that when the student is ready a teacher will come, well the beginning of my lesson started with this book. Thanks so much for bringing me back to me and forcing (in a positive way) me to realize that life can only get better if we exercise a little faith."
3,Misleading Title,"I found some great stories here that were new to me. It's a good collection of stories but there are a number of well-written stories here that are not Hard Science Fiction. The title is misleading. The editors seem to have no sympathy with the genre. In their introductions to the stories they seem to sneer at the whole genre from their elevated literary viewpoint. They are entitled to their opinions, but then, why did they do this collection? I suppose a collection entitled ""A Gentle Introduction to the Better Sort of Science Fiction by Those Who Know Better Than You"", or ""Science Fiction that You Don't Need to be Embarrassed to Show your English-major Friends"", wouldn't have much of a market. The snobbery and put-downs are really annoying.So, as has been suggested, skip the editorial commentary, let the stories speak for themselves."
2,Not very fun,"They have these dolls at my old school. I do not like them. They weren't fun. I'd much rather have Barbie dolls than these. These may be good for little kids, but not for my age kids."
3,Size Does Matter!,My daughter received the Melissa & Doug Wooden Doll House Last Christmas. We thought that it would be nice to get more dolls for the house and purchased the wooden Family Doll Set. Didn't even cross my mind that the Melissa & Doug company wouldn't design their wooden doll sets to go with their wooden doll houses and furniture. Big disappointment. On our part we should have checked size but shouldn't these products go together? Not sure I'd recommend the doll houses & doll sets to anyone or purchase any more of their products.
4,a little flimsy but still fun,"For the price, I would expect these dolls to be a little more durable than they are. The doll body itself seems pretty sturdy, but the clothing was already unraveling a bit when I took them out of the box. The clothes are thin and not well stitched.That being said, my daughter (2-1/2 years old) loves these little dolls. I bought them to use as potty-training incentives and they were perfect for that use. And they're pretty cute, too."
5,Cute and funny,"These dolls were so cute and funny they do have wooden heads, hands, feet,torsos but legs and arms are bendable due to what appears to be rope covered wire. My daughter just moves them around and poses them I needed them in a last minuet b-day decision so it was all good. Dont know about durability as she hasnt had them long, clothes are not removeable so cleaning doesnt look possible."
4,Nice wooden dolls,"This is a nice set as it contains Grandparents too. My Mother was rather horrified to think she was portrayed with grey hair and an apron but the Grandfather is the funniest with his bald head! My son loves the baby best and likes to give it baths constantly. It's a well made, well-rounded set of dolls for a good price."
4,Great for Doll House Use,I bought these figurines as part of a larger present for my granddaughter's doll house Christmas present. She immediately opened them and started enjoying their use along with the furniture of the doll house. They appear to be just the right size. The only downfall I see is that the grandfather doll looks like a homeless person. Maybe I'm too sensitive. Amazon also gives a good price on them. I investigated other Online sites and Amazon had the best price.
4,Nice doll set!,This is a nice set of wooden bendable dools. Durable. My daughter has a Barbie size dollhouse and uses all size dolls for it so this works well. I first saw this at my son's speech therapy office. While one triplet had speech the other two played and waited. My daughter played with these dolls in a wooden dollhouse that was smaller so unless the dollhouse is tiny I can't see why these wouldn't work in most dollhouses. The best feature is how bendable they are so they can sit and what not.
4,Dolls are cute and seemingly unbreakable,"I bought these dolls for my daughters doll house and instead of putting them in the dollhouse she carries them around and collects them! I im guessing that they'll be used more as she gets older,good quality. But I wish they were just a little cuter!"
5,Excellent dolls for pretend play!,Well made and my 3-year old daughter has done a lot of active pretend play with them.
4,Great Dolls,My daughter loves playing the dolls. She takes turns being them and having her tea parties and other games with them. They are great for her education and enjoyment.
5,Just what we were looking for!,"These dolls are natural and so cute, especially the baby. I recommend this family for if you have a doll house, as we do."
5,"Laugh out loud, funny!","A co-worker bought this book for a friend of his who was having a baby. He brought it to work to show us, and I laughed until I cried, and all of my mascara was off! I am buying multiple copies of this book to keep on hand, and one for myself. It is one of the funniest books, ever!"
3,"seriously, LOL","If you need THIS book, you are in REAL trouble as a parent.The only thing its good for is a GREAT LAUGH & that is just what i did, laughed till i cried."
5,The ideal baby shower gift,Very funny book. Went to a baby shower recently and the mom-to-be was wailing she wanted an instruction manual-- Just so happened I had one for her!! Take a look at this!
5,Hilarious book for new parents,Not sure what to give new parents that already have too many infant clothes and useless stuffed animals? This book is a hoot from cover to cover. It features airline-literature-styled cartoons of do's and don'ts for new parents. One couple we gave it to said that a party they had wound up completely focused on the book. New parents could probably use a lot more humor in their lives after baby arrives and this book will serve them well.
5,OMG this book is hilarious!,"Got this for an expecting couple who are a little out of the norm.They got your typical 'baby' things, which they knew they needed but isn't really 'them', if that makes sense. once they opened this book they could not stop laughing. It completely made their shower. They still talk about the book to this day.It's a must for any shower you feel will be too 'stuffy' and you know you would like the parents-to-be to have some good laughs."
3,Funny for a minute,"This book is a very cute gag gift but it literally has maybe 15 pages. It is a wood/cardboard page book so it only has a few pages. Nothing special, but still very funny the first time you look through it."
3,Although it may be funny...,"While this book is on the funny side of baby humor, I would not suggest buying it. If you happen to see it at a bookstore or know someone who has it, a quick look through would do. However, the The Mini Safe Baby Handling Kit might be more worth your while. It has a mini version of the same book listed here, a few magnets of some of the 'instructions', some stickers, a stand alone chore wheel for mom and dad and an 'instructional' bib. It is cheaper than the book and would make a cute gag gift for a baby shower or someone who enjoys this kind of humor."
4,Lightcast is fascinating,"It's true the effect is not bright enough in party/dance situations. In darker more intimate situations as mood or effect lighting, the light seems to dance and pulse and take on a life of its own. Mesmerizing and totally effective. We love it."
3,The effect is kind of lame,"If it was a bit brighter it would have been cool but it doesn't really light up the room like I thought it would. Overall it's alright something to watch but I never would bring it to a party. Look at ""the laser star machine"" if you want something amazing."
4,Unbreathed Memories,"What a great book! I am hooked and have since read everything else I can find with Talley's name on it. The plot was intriguing, and the story brought me right up to where Hannah was mentally and emotionally. I just had to read the rest of Hannah's books to see how she got into such a situation. I loved the relationship between Hannah and her husband. Reality! Not every day is blissful and this writer sure tells it like it is. Although I am somewhat unfamiliar with the area portrayed, I could actually find myself walking those same streets. Good job! I'm hooked!"
4,Really four and a half stars,"I love Hannah Ives. She is just about the most realistic heroine around today. I had read ""Sing It to Her Bones"" and liked it. Now I discover there are several more Hannah Ives books out there. I guess I will be reading them out of order, but it is worth it.I have this marked this book down one star because Hannah idiotically puts herself in danger at the end. It was the only thing that didn't ring true because Hannah is otherwise extremely intelligent and sensible."
5,Unbreathed Memories,"Marcia Talley has done it again with the continnuing tale of Hannah Ives. This is a true mystery that keeps you guessing. you can feel the hurt, anguish her characters went through. Can't wait for the next one!"
2,Good Read.. Save for a Rainy Week,"This was my first book by Marcia Talley and it'll probably be my last. Even though it was a good read, for a short book it took my a while to finish. Didn't have me sitting at the edge of my seat to finish like other books I've read. Knew what the ending would be several chapters prior to the end (and I don't think this was the intention of the author, or maybe it was, don't know). Plot was very predictive, lots of unnecessary information to fill the pages. Overall, this is a book to save for a rainy week when you don't have anything else to do."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"This product is useless. DO NOT BUY!It is a cheap copy of the 3M product which is no longer manufactured. It doesn't cut properly, doesn't imprint properly, doesn't turn easily between letters and places cut lines across the tape when imprinting letters. Have had two of these and they are both the same. Very Disappointed - doesn't deserve even a 1 star rating."
3,Best (i.e.Only) Braille Labeler Made,"Yes, it doesn't cut. Yes, you have to press hard to make the braille readable. Yes, the old Dymo braille labeler was great. However, it is no longer available. This model is the only braille embossing labeler you can buy. As a rehab therapist for people with low vision I buy a lot of these because they are the only option. I press hard to advance the tape, then I pull it out by hand and cut it with scissors. The entire process stinks, but I remember the many years when NO hand-held, manual braille labeler was available. This this is better (barely) than nothing."
5,Used hard,I had a braille r and broke it because I used it alot for my blind grand sons toys. This is handy and easy to use.
2,"Poor call quality, speakerphone issues","I thought I would love this phone, but I was so disappointed! Every time I made calls, people would complain that I was cutting out. When I had the speakerphone on, I could hear the other person perfectly clearly. But all I could hear them saying was ""Hello? Hello? Are you still there?"" They could not hear me at all.I actually exchanged the phone for another one of the same, with the same results. So now I have washed my hands of it.Let me add that my previous phone, the Motorola V551, had none of these problems. Call quality and speakerphone were great. I don't even want to comment on all the features such as the phone and MP3 player. If the phone doesn't work, who cares? I think that Motorola is concentrating too hard on bells and whistles and a slick design, and ignoring the basics."
3,Good college fridge.,"I had this fridge all through college and it was pretty good. The fridge itself looks really nice and stylish with the stainless steel. I loved having the separate real freezer, which none of the college dorm fridges had. I did run into a problem, where after about a year, the fridge portion started cooling very unevenly. My milk in the door would spoil too quick while items in the back would freeze solid. It worked out okay, but I had to learn where to place certain items in the fridge for best temperature."
3,Could have been a great shoe IF...,"they were true to size. I read somewhere that you have to be ""fitted"" with Clarks, which I can't do because most stores don't carry my size (5.5). As if the buyers have to fit themselves to the shoe brand instead of the company making shoes that run true to size. I wanted to keep these, but sent them back because for the price I shouldn't have had to buy insoles to keep them from slipping."
1,"Good Concept, Poor Implementation","I purchased this product with high hopes. I have a 40' driveway and typical shovels just don't do the job. This worked great until about the fifth stroke. The wheels are kept on the axle by metal caps at the ends. The caps get forced off by the pressure of the wheels in nothing flat. Since you're shoveling snow with this product, trying to find one of these caps after it falls off is a lost cause. The handle is bolted together midway between the scoop and the top of the handle and it is not very stable. This product would be excellent if it had a one piece handle and holeds drilled through the axle and the cap with a pin to hold the caps in place. In it's current form it is nearly useless."
1,NOSWISSWATCH!,Even after manually activating it won't receive the WWVB signal.Reazon unknown. I'm very disappointed!
2,Incredibly bare bones,"I purchaced one of these a couple of years back. It only tells accurate time. It has no alarms, backlight or any other features. There are watches for the same price with more functions. Get one of them instead."
4,Nice frame,The ziga digital pic frame was easy to set up and works great. The only problem that I had was with the remote. The enter button on the remote does not work and did not work when I received it. Overall a good product.
5,Perfect,"I purchased this for my wife for Christmas and it was just perfect. We don't have a TV in the kitchen, but she loves to watch shows, listen to music, etc. I ripped her X-files DVD collection to .avi format and loaded them to her 2GB CF card, along with some mp3's and images. Now, with the remote, she can enjoy her favorite shows and music.The quality of the images are great. Nice and sharp. The frame is bright and wonderful.Con: Sometimes the volume control is a little too low. However, you can plug in standard 1/8"" jack speakers or headphones.Update: September 20, 2008: Still works great. I've gone through one remote battery, and this product still rocks on!"
2,Inexpensive and there is a reason why,I was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this Ziga Digital Frame. I returned it.
2,Really disappointed with quality,"Since this was my first purchase of such a product, I don't know how this one compares, but I was very disappointed with the quality of the display. Resolution is very poor. This was far too much money to spend on such a lousy product."
3,Cant play my movies,"I own a Casio Exilim EXZ750 7MP (sold at amazon). I bought this frame because it has 640 x 480 resolutions and it supported many different movie formats. However, it wasn't able to play movies from my camera which does have a strange codec."
1,Amazon Customer Lost,"The item showed up defective. That was no big deal. The problem here is that Amazon's ""Customer Support"" is as useful as a set of square wheels. I wanted to exchange this item for one that was working, however they ran out. I asked if they could ship me something comparable and on time for Christmas and the process was like working for the government. It was such a hassle and the manager could not wait to lose a customer, it just made me wonder why Amazon is trying put themselves out of business. I have shopped at Amazon since it began and never had any complaints. Thank you Amazon for making my decision easy. Now I will make sure to let my friends and family know not to shop at Amazon."
5,Good features,"A bit tricky to set up, but nothing special by the standards of today's technology. Excellent features"
3,its an ok photo frame,"It's an ok photo frame.Pro:1. Easy setup. Plug the memory card with jpeg images inside, voila it starts default slideshow.2. MP3 + slideshow3. external screen. So this little frame could be connected to external monitor. (projector or widescreen tv)4. Auto adjust photo size to fit the screenCons:1. This screen is only 640x480. Above that resolution will only waste the memory space. The screen does not look sharp, and darker images would look washed out.2. No album view. Meaning... even if you split your images into separate folders/albums. The frame would show all images thumbnails in multiple pages NOT by the folders/albums."
2,Crappy Display,Man! My pictures look horrible on this thing. I now only use it because I have it. But when I really want to show pictures to guests I either use my cell phone (which has a better resolution than this) or go to my computer.
2,Poor resolution,Don't lose the manual or the buttons will make no sense at all. It gets very hot. The images are poor quality and ratio must be reset to 3:2 before even halfway decent pictures appear. It has no internal memory.
4,High Quality Frame,The frame is easy to set up and use. Image quality is very good. Would have liked more choices for the speed of the slide show.
3,Nice as a gift!,"I enjoyed the design of this frame. It is definitely a nice gift for the holiday season. And the Price is quite reasonable.However, the picture quality was disappointing. The resolutions are low, and most of the pictures are darker and redder than they were."
4,Easy to use!,"I was skeptical at first, even after recieving it. But, it really is Plug and Play! The only down side is no USB port and trying to figure out the size of the picture to avoid the black bars at the top and bottom. Anyone with any type of picture editing software can alter the pics, it's just a little pain staking. I'm sure my Mom will think it is a great Mother's Day Gift!!"
4,Better than expected for the price,What a purchase!! Simple and easy to setup and a great Christmas gift. Now it holds our wedding photos and is proudly displayed in the living room
3,"Did not work that well, in my opinion.","It did not cover that well, and the surface it was put on was treated how the prep said it should be. No it did not run...but it was more watery than I expected. I doubt I will buy this product in any color...again."
1,Not Full Enough,What this CD needs is more songs and longer versions. Not all of the tracks are full versions which makes this CD worthless. The company can afford to put on 20 more minutes of music if you ask me!
1,DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM,I DIDNT ORDER THIS ITEM AND DONT KNOW HOW THIS PERSON GOT MY E-MAIL ARE CREDIT CARD INFORMATION
5,Excellent,"The item came quickly and is in excellent condition, better than I would have expected for a second-hand item. It's as if the book had never been used and still in its wrapper. I will definitely shop again with this company."
5,Just like Grandma used to make,"Definitely these recipes are from the ""homeland."" These bring me back to days when my Grandmother loving cooked dinner. Delicious and very, very comforting. Highly recommend."
5,Biblically Solid,"""The Bible promises that a serious child of God can know the perfect will of God for his life and experience the joy, reality, and fullness of divine guidance"" with that assurance Bob Mumford leads us into a further understanding of the process of flowing in God's guidance (p. 21). On page 40 he tells us ""...most guidance occurs when we are not even conscious of it."" God arranges circumstances in the lives of His children. God's guidance is referred to as ""adventurous"" in more than one place in this book and that is a good way to describe it. Mumford points out ""The world calls it luck. The Christian calls it providence"" (p. 44). Learning to walk in God's guidance is learning to cultivate an intimate walk with God he adds. This is a very helpful, inspiring book which I strongly recommend."
1,Pro ball head is defective,When I tried using my Giotto pro ball head it did not hold its position at all. No matter how tight I turned the lever (even with a alan wrench) it continued to be loose and therefore completely worthless to me. Do not buy this product it is defective.
2,Bad OCR,"The content in this book seems good, but the Kindle version seems to have been scanned in from a paper copy and OCR'ed. The book has random lowercase-l and number-1 interchanged all over the place, and random other OCR errors. It makes it not only distracting to read, but confusing where important things in the book are just plain wrong because of the OCR errors!"
3,Guide a Good Read,"A well-written, well-researched, enjoyable outing from the author of the annotated Dracula. Anyone with a more-than-casual interest in Dracula will be well-rewarded with a read of this book. (And if your interest in Vampiredom's most famous son comes from the movies, don't hesitate to read Stoker's ""Dracula"" itself ... once you get past the possibly unfamiliar epistolary style, there's a real corker of a story there that too few lately have read!)Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."
3,Aaron Carter,This is a good book but it has too much information in some parts. I got this book when I was ... a fan of Aaron Carter. This book has great photos too.
2,Too many typos,"I'm surprised that the previous review did not comment on the number of typographical errors; as far as I can see there is only one edition. The typos range from the merely distracting, to places where sentences become gibberish. Based on content, I'd give this at least 4 stars, but I found it too difficult to read. It's a nice complement to *Goedel's Proof* by Nagel and Newman--N & N give a much clearer exposition of Goedel's work, but Hintikka brings up a number of points I have not seen elsewhere (warning: many of the points raised can't be fully understood without referring to other works that treat them in more depth, unless you already have a strong background in mathematical foundations and logic)."
5,British Brutality,This book is a great read if you want to learn about what the British did to the peole of Kenya. I do not want to give away the story but the British has done a lot to different people around the globe. It is amazing that when you fight for your land and your freedom they call you savages and call you a troublemaker. The Kenyans fought with the British in WWII but at home in their country they could not be free.
4,x is good,x is the best def leppard cd since hysteria. adrenalize was ok . but slang and euphoria were really bad.
1,Truly for Dummies,"Purchase this only if you have a minute idea of what a computer is.This is very elementary and assumes you have absolutely no knowledge of what a network even is. It doesn't go any further than that either.Don't expect that you will be learn how to network computers together (my expectation); only that you will learn what components are involved --but not how they work or how to actually network them.I don't mind basic info, but this book should be titled ""Network Equipment Descriptions for Dummies"" certainly not it's current title.Way too many jokes as well (more annoying than entertaining)."
5,Excellent Beginners Book,"Wonderful clear and easy to understand book on networks, network topology, & all of the TLA's (Three Letter Acronyms) flying around. Must have for MIS managers and Network Administrators"
3,networking for dummies,good book needs to be updated to include vistabook good delivery from amazon very slow
1,Very little value...find another book on the topic,This book is a complete waste of time for both the beginner and especially the non-beginner. The author spends a great deal of time trying to be funny and wastes the reader's time and energy. He should have spent more time giving content. He does not give even the beginner much concrete advice. I would strongly suggest you find another book; his book has very little value. There are better books for the beginner in networking.
1,The dumbest of the dummies,I completely agree with all of the other 1-star raters. I was looking for a guide for troubleshooting and fixing problems with peer-to-peer networks (which most homes and small businesses use)-- and this book just ain't it.
1,The worst book I've ever read,"It should be possible to rate with 0 stars! Because that's what this book deserves.This book is imprecise. Doesn't tell you how to do things, it just says that (by the act of god) things can be done. Sometimes this information is even misleading.Be aware! If you want to learn something about networking DON'T BUY this book.If you want my book I can sell it for half the price! (I would give it for free, but this is to protect you)By the way, Doug Lowe jokes are not that good..."
3,Definately for beginners,"Not a bad book, but it is VERY basic. If you have worked with a network before, there is little information you can glean from this text. For someone who knows little about networks, or computers as a whole, this may be a good purchase. Do not, however, expect this book to teach you everything you need to know about working with a network. It is very simple, which makes the topics easy to understand, but expect to get another book centering on your particular network if you plan to do some serious networking. I would, however, recommend this book to newbies in networking as it goes over terms and concepts that everyone must know."
3,Very very basic,"Wow, perhaps the title says it all. If you need to know how to connect to a network *printer* this book might be the one for you. I build web sites and want to learn more about the backend, hardware side of things. Our network guys suggested that I learn about different kind of networks, OSI model and protocols. For that, I recommend ""Teach Yourself Networking Visually"" by maran graphics. The ""Dummies"" book is not what I needed. It's probably ideal for extreme novices."
2,Pretty much useless,"I bought a home networking kit, and I was having problems connecting it, so I bought this book. This book had much less useful information than the manual that came witht the networking kit, and that was hundreds of pages smaller. This book really does not tell you how to actually hook up or work with network."
5,Most useful book I've read in ages!!!,"I love this book! It's well worth the time and effort.The authors share their thinking techniques...so that one can look at trends and see what's really going on.It's far too easy to get inundated with data that masks underlying trends..and the result is not seeing the forest for the trees. Weiner and Brown's lessons are well taught, simply laid out and the lessons will keep one from falling into the ""same old, same old"" trap.Anyone involved in strategy needs to read this. You'll never look at things the same way again. It's a classic textbook!!!"
3,Important for Anyone in Business,I'm an entrepreneur. Understanding what the future trends likely will be is essential to creating business success. This book is a must-read for all business owners or execs.
4,A Good video,"I remember watching this video years ago when my aunt brought it by for a visit and decided to buy it because I enjoyed it that much. If you aren't a fan of Grant Hill before watching this video you just might become one after. This video catalogs Grant's meteoric rise in the NBA, to his days as a college player at Duke, to behind the scenes with his family and friends and exposes him as great guy and class act. Even though injuries plagued his career and derailed his hall of fame potential, there is no evidence that he is any less of a person today than what the video declared he is. A nice guy, a great basketball player with the passion of a warrior. There are some pretty nice highlights of Grant, although I wish there had been more of him on this video, they are still pretty good and the highlights are my favorite part of watching the video.For me the video was a good investment. I'm very glad to have added it to my collection."
5,Great clock,Bought for my mom's christmas present. She wanted a carriage clock and absolutely loved it. It must be working fine because she's not said anything to the contrary and mother's would!
4,Nice book and informative,"I have just begun collecting California pottery, and this was a nice book with lots of pictures for comparing styles and stamps."
3,"clever, but misleading","These postcards are cute, but there are only 10 different cards in the pack. The advertised ""30 cards"" are actually 3 each of these 10 cards."
1,Useless,"its pity, that there is no limit in comerciality. the trilogy contains every necessery message.Sorry for the faults and greetings from berlin"
5,I only wish Danielle Engle wrote movie scripts!!!,"Her writings would transfer so incredibly well to FILM!!! She blends eroticism with imagination and creativity, and the end-result is HOT!!! Too many writers of erotic literature are either too bland (lesbian sex is restricted mostly to cunnilingus) or too harsh (women whip and torture eachother without any apparent enjoyment shown on either side). Danielle's women are turned on by eachother, and it makes it so much more entertaining for the reader! And even when the action seems involuntary (like when the biker chicks abduct the two teenage girls), it's still incredible passionate & enjoyable! An excellent collection of lesbian erotica!"
2,For the S&M-minded.,"I'm not a prude by any stretch, but I guess there was just too much bondage, whipping, kidnapping and revenge going on in these stories for my taste. The writing was good and certainly steamy and there are definitely some passages I've re-read and plan to highlight before sending this book to my friend. Perhaps it's the downside of short stories, but I found myself wanting to know more about the characters -- and wanting them to have sex for reasons other than anger -- before I could really be turned on."
4,DEFINITELY FANTASY EROTICA!,"UNCENSORED definitely presented diverse erotica yet, I found too many stories had women being whipped. That was a turn-off. Loved the one story with the voyeuristic theme and would have liked to have read another. It was hillarious! UNCENSORED is positively wellwritten and tantilizing. The plots are fast-paced and straight to the point; real appreciative qualities. Wasn't too pleased with the fact that the ""desirable"" character description was predominately the same in 70% of the stories. Another turn-off."
1,Racism and bad writing do not make for a good read!,I signed up for the free 14 day trial and canceled it after reading one article from the writer Jason Whitlock. Badly written and full of the worst kind of racism and stereotypes this is as bad as sports writing gets. Can't imagine why Amazon would want to be associated with a product like this and the hateful views it espouses.
4,"Not an easy read, but thought provoking.","Did you know that before quantum physics or atomic physics, classical physics maintained that there was a world ether through which light waves traveled? I had no idea what the struggle this old physicist was having because I did't even know that what he was losing had ever existed. However, I learned a lot, not only about the history of physics, but about a German scientist's view of science and his home land. If you would like a challenge, try this one, but don't take it to the beach."
1,"Deceptive, Flawed, & VERY Expensive!!!","This ""kit"" DOES NOT INCLUDE an AC power adaptor cord!!! As one raving reviewer noted: ""...you can charge batteries at home with the inclusion of the AC cord that already comes with the Canon G1."" Well, guess what? I don't happen to own the Canon G1, so I guess the ad should clearly state that this kit is INCOMPLETE! The package insert instructions are absolutely horrible! For over $100 you would expect a complete kit. Don't buy it! For $10 you can find a complete (albeit not Canon branded) car and home charger, with free shipping! This is a total ripoff in a fraudulent misleading package and ad!"
1,"All Five stars, come on....","This book sucks! Read Business at the Speed of Thought...at least Bill Gates has a successful business and why would we go to a therapist that deals with stress management for answers to our business problems? Most of his clients are wealthy housewives and movie stars anyway, and we all know how shallow they can be..."

1,MISERABLE- The first book I couldn't finish!!!,"I've read other Julie Beard books and love her work. Her name and the 5 stars is what made me buy this book ... but how this ever got 5 stars, I'll never know. The story was totally foolish -- a young lady decides not to marry because of one wonderful kiss - if she can't find a passion like that, then she'll have nobody?? COME ON!! And the ""hero"" doesn't remember this wonderful kiss at all until he kisses her again and then it all comes back to him? YEAH, RIGHT!!!! Then he feels guilty that she hasn't married and he feels honor bound to beg her forgiveness and save her from marrying the villain -- REALLY!! I finally threw the book in the recycle stack. Julie must have been under some deadline to put out a book, because this one was not up to her normal standards."
3,"a pleasant, quick read","I debated about giving this book 3 or 4 stars. Three & 1/2 would have been best. No, it's not particularly original and neither the plot nor the characters will haunt you for any length of time. This story features little in the way of emotional depth either. However, it is pleasantly diverting, has likeable if somewhat superficial characters, some interesting secondary characters, and a nice twist or two to its sometimes unlikely plot.Beard's writing races along, pulling the reader into a pleasantly diverting tale with appropriate swiftness. Perhaps the motivations of the characters are not well explained, and the hero's rakish qualities uncertain. But the solicitor hero and the stalwart heroine are a good match. All due to one dance, once kiss? Yes, because she fell in love with him in that moment. Jack's fear -- literally panic attacks -- at the thought of marriage makes for an unusual complication.It's not Julia Quinn or Teresa Medeiros, but it's a decent read."
1,Old Version,This is the old version of this product! It's so small on the screen its difficult to use. Get version 4.0 you can change the size on the screen.
2,Not BD quality,"A little bit disappointed. The scenes were specticular; however, the filming quality was not so good. Made me feel like watching DVD. If you ever watched ""OVER ALASKA"", you would understand the difference.Overall, I do not think it is worth the money for a blu-ray title."
3,tennesseecurt,Just like the Grand Canyon video. Quality could have been better. Needs a lesson from the OVER series of Videos.
1,over rated and boring,Another set of broken marriages and a cast of bored and boring characters having a mid life crisis in Berkeley. I lost interest with the slow place and predictability of the plot.
4,Good album,"These dudes have a raw old school industrial sound that I really enjoy. I got into these dudes late, but thats all good cause I find very few bands anymore who have this sound."
4,Math Curse,This book was entertaining. It is excellent for a math teacher who wants to get the students interest. A nice ice breaker for the beginning of the school year.
4,Great Real-Life Math Book,"This book is great for showing kids how math constantly appears in real life!Lots of math story problems on each page that kids can work out.Cool artwork.Reading the whole book to an elementary class in one sitting would most likely be too much, though."
3,not age appropriate,Likely should have investigated further before purchasing. It's not for my intended audience (grade 4-6 math students)... thought it would be fun to share with classes. Not as clever or engaging as I had hoped for.
2,Math Curse can be confusing.,"Being a children's book, this is hard to understand. If we were younger, we'd be confused. Otherwise, the story is fairly interesting but young readers will be turned off by a book all about math. This book has an adult theme yet in a children's format alienating all of its audience. This interesting theme could be rewritten in an adult format."
4,Anxious humor,Readers will have little problem finding the anxious humor in this story at it explores the days events through math problems. The intensity of this tale builds with the use of dynamic illustrations that draw you ever deeper into the curse. An absolute word feast that may have some readers checking their dictionary. A calculated treat.
2,Eh...,"I had decided to read TRV because I wanted to read a funny book with lots of hot sex.Well....I didn't find this book as humorous as I've found the other SH books I've read. In fact, by the end I was pretty much depressed!!!I'd rate the book as ""ok"" but not great. It didn't live up to everything I had heard about this series."
1,please save me from weak women...,"I am like the next woman, I would think that I would like my men to be strong, but this? The hero was just awful, rude, mean to the girl, just plain awful. The girl just keep coming back for more, like a kicked dog or something. This was not a good book! It has taken me over a week to read it. I usually only take a day or 2 to read books, depending on how busy I am. I am just starting to read Sandra Hill's books. I have bought all her others and I hope those are better."
5,This is an unpresidented classic. No other comes close.,"There is not one story that I did not enjoy on this CD, nor did I find offensive. It helps to bring my spirit up when I find myself down. It's just too funny. END"
1,Bill Cosby Himself,"There is a picture of the ""Bill Cosby:Himself"" on the cover of the DVD but the DVD is audio only....just sound, no images! Very dissapointing. Suggest the title be renamed to Bill Cosby: an Audio version only of ""Himself"". However, I was and remain very appreciative of the Amazon service level in my efforts to re-order a Visual and Audio version of the DVD. Thanks, Bern"
1,Bicycles of Boston??,"Instead of the Interesting cover pictured on the ad I receive a copy with a photo of a bycycle on the front cover, AND the back cover! What, I wonder, has this to do with the Graveyards of Boston? I would like to have received the book as represented. Also the print is so small that some magnifier is needed."
4,Good to pass the time,Better know how to spell and move the cursor through the alphabet selection if you desire to when against the computer or real players. Questions are not difficult and there are plenty of questions in the chips to keep random play fair.
2,Very Vague,"This was a bit too basic and while it goes into details on the problems, doesnt actually tell you many details on solutions. The author is a salon consultant and shares his experiences through brief stories about people he's helped in the past. Therefore, the book helps you understand and clarify issues you may face, but doesnt actually give you a step by step guide on how to resolve them (at least not in the detail one would expect). I hate to date myself, but the overhwelming question in my head after reading this is ""Where's the beef?""I get the feeling that the book is just a tool to get your appetite wet enough to buy the author's consulting services."
4,Good But Has some flaws,"I bought my game genie for my GameBoy Color and was a little unsure if it would fit in my GameBoy at first. But it fit in just fine and i dont know what people are talking about it not fitting. The only flaws are 1, it doesn't save the codes you enter 2, it doesnt have a hole lot of codes for pokemon. Overall it's pretty good."
4,"Awesome ""budget"" mic","My pair of Nady RSM-1 mics have become my favorite drum overhead. Like the reviewer before, I'm using them in a Blumlein array, but it's also been great for any other configuration (mid/side, spaced pair, Glyn Johns method, Recorderman method, anything else you've got). It's a tad dark compared to a condenser (shocking, I know), but nothing that can't be overcome with eq. The gains....clarity, even response, punchiness, stability of the stereo image....vastly outweight that.CONS:-when i got mine a few years ago, there was a fair amount of muffling inside the microphone housing to protect the diaphragm from wind bursts. Removing this VASTLY improves high end response and clarity, but it is a B!*^# to remove. Damaged one of them when i did it an dhad to send it to Nady for repair. TOTALLY WORTH IT.That's really the only con. These aren't Royers or Coles, but for the price, hot DAMN they're good."
4,I LOVED it!,"I think these are fun- I cut out the dolls and dresses, mounted them on sticke refrigerator magnet backing (from Hobby Lobby) and popped them on the fridge as oversized, exceedingly fun magnets.Everyone adores them and will play with them- it's hard to not to have favorites! What I want is some 'Charlies Angels' complete with Farrah (Bring on the Seventies Mr. Tierney!)Look, I don't take the illustrations too literally (i.e. freeze-framing the film for details and comparing with the booklet). Have fun! Play! Enjoy!"
2,is this funk?,only thing i cant figure is how can you have a funk album with no Betty Mabry Davis & no Sly and the Family Stone!
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT.","this is a very enjoyable set, but it only gets 3 stars. here's why: IN THE GREAT HISTORY OF FUNK, THERE ARE 2 CHIEF ARCHITECTS: JAMES BROWN & SLY STONE! this set has james, but no SLY. therefore, it is sorely incomplete and merits only a ""good"" rating. enjoy the music, but don't expect a TRUE history lesson in the funk!"
4,good listening for Kayak fans,"It's about time a record company decided to put Kayak on cd. The three originals (Starlight Dancer, Phantom of the Night and Periscope Life) contain all your fave's. Be warned Starlight Dancer removed a few songs: Land on the Water and Don't You Care (two that I enjoyed) and replaced them with songs I never heard before. Takes some getting used to. I still want the Starlight Dancer Iam used to. Overall it's a very good 2 cd. Listen to the re-mix ""Irene"" nuff said."
3,Good bridge between early and latter day Kayak.,"Starlight Dancer here is the original European version. Some songs here were included on the American version. The other half ot the U.S. version was from the European only ""The Last Encore."" Side one of ""The Last Encore"" is one of the best ever. It is available on cd."
4,Slow moving,"It's a good workout, but you have to be okay with moving slow and easy. I've never been good at that. I hit it hard and fast, but my goal this year is to work on more gentle moves. The abs workout is really good. If you think the only way to attack your abs is through the old fashioned sit-ups or crunches...THINK AGAIN. Once you get the technique used here, you will feel your abs being worked. It is important to take the time to sit and watch the entire DVD. There is plenty of instruction that you will need to know and understand."
2,Not for beginners,I wanted more instruction and ways to to modify the exercises. It is difficult for me to do most of the exercises in a standing position due to the balance required and the hint of muscle cramps.
2,"Some of it's Callanetics, some not.","I bought this before Callan's 2 intense, effective, original videos were on Amazon as DVDs. This lightweight interpretation has a lot of arm-waving that just aint exercise. 2 stars for the part that slightly resembles Callanetics, 3 subtracted for the arm-waving. My 2 Callan DVDs will be here Thursday."
4,A Smooth Set,"despite His Sound Changing quite a bit in the Late 70's&80's Grover Washington Jr played with alot of Feeling.""Mister Magic"" Alone can be put into any Mix&still Rock any House Party.He had a Cool,Smooth Soulful tone that is Missed.a Good Introduction to a Artist that Went Way too soon."
3,Madonna - Ciao Italia ( live from Italy).,"This concert dvd is well worth watching.It is enjoyable, but definately not in the same league as concerts that came along after this one.It is great to be able to look back on Madonna performing in concert in the 1980's.Not a bad buy and people should enjoy."
4,Good Show And A Worthwhile Investment,"This is a good concert w/ good cosumes, cheoreography, and an awesome setlist. Songs include ""Open Your Heart"", ""Where's the Party"", ""Papa Don't Preach"", and an amazing version of ""True Blue"". All in all, Madonna is #1!!!!!!!!"
2,Not So Good!,"This is the worst-edited Madonna video I have ever seen! Footage is taken from at least 2 concerts. If you pay atention, Madonna is wearing a gold necklace, and then she isn't, and then she is again! Then, her hair is neat, then it's messy, then it's neat again! Then, the color is dull, then in another shot, the color is vibrant! Don't waste your money, buy the Girlie Show!"
2,Disappointing Performance,"I am a big fan of Madonna, and I love her 80s music , but I feel that this performance is disappointing. The costumes are tacky, although the one she wears for the Dress You Up/Material Girl/Like a Virgin made me laugh. (At least she doesn't take herself too seriously!) Her singing is the worst that I've ever heard from her. It sounds like she's trying to force her voice or something. I felt uncomfortable listening to her, especially in the ballads. However, what is most disappointing is the choreography. Anybody who has seen later performances in Blond Ambition or the Girlie Show will be shocked at how little choreography is in this show. This is a pity seeing as how her dancing is the most appealing aspect of her shows in my opinion. In summary, unless you are a hardcore Madonna fan, this video/DVD is not worth buying. Go for a later tour like the Girlie Show...you'll be much happier with your purchace!"
3,"Not Spectacular, but good","This is probably not the best Madonna concert, but it does have more heart. Madonna seems to enjoy performing and feels the crowd, opposed to later concerts where there is almost no audience interaction.Positives. (1) Great songs (2) Madonna puts her all into itNegatives: (1) Madonna's voice (2) Bad ChoreographyThe DVD itself is Ok. The sound not bad considering it's just a transfer and the video is fair. I think the VHS version is better. Hopefully it will be released with remastered sound.A must have for Madonna fans and if you're only the casual fan then skip it. For an amazing live Madonna see the DROWNED WORLD TOUR."
4,Good show Madge,"Being a big Madonna fan, I was pleased with her performance during this tour back in 1987. The costumes however are tacky and tasteless but the choice of songs as I am sure any Big Madonna fan would agree are Excellent. M clearly is not frightened to perform live and this does show in certain tracks such as "" Live To Tell "" and ""Whos that Girl"" but I recommend that this be a good investment!"
2,surprisingly lame coming from Madonna,"I saw the Girlie Show and was so impressed. This video is a big disappointment. It lacks the choreography and stage show that the Girlie show had. Unless your a big Madonna fan, I don't imagine anyone enjoying this much. I think Madonna has talent and can put on a show better than any artist out there, but this video doesn't prove it"
2,Did not work in this region,I had to send the dvd back because when you put the dvd in the player it says don't work in this region on the screen.
5,Prima Madonna! Track List,She is the best.1. Open Your Heart2. Lucky Star3. True Blue4. Papa Don't Preach5. White Heat6. Causing A Commotion7. The Look Of Love8. Medley: Dress You Up/Material Girl/Like A Virgin9. Where's The Party10. Live To Tell11. Into The Groove12. La Isla Bonita13. Who's That Girl14. Holiday
4,Power,"For my opinnion this is the most powerfull performace of Madonna, the energy and her smile always over the face is beautiful."
1,God Awful,"ok, this concert is REALLY bad. The fact that the Virgin Tour was better than this is just plain sad. This one seems even more dated an amateurish than the Virgin Toru. The performances are so cheesy and weak, and Madonna's vocals are pretty bad. And the costumes...oh lawd, have MERCY. they are dog ugly. MAdonna herself looks pretty bad with her shredded wheat hairdo, caterpillar eyebrows and ugly makeup. Add to the fact that this video is a cut and paste job from at least 2 concerts (one being in Japan, then what's the point of calling it ""Live From ITALY""??) Damn, this whole thing is just a mess. Thank god she recovered with the fantastic and legendary Blond ambition tour."
5,Shape your sound,A great way to shape your sound or to simply give your volume an extra boost. Helps to deepen your bottom end and kick out the highs! Punch it!
4,ENJOYABLE THRILLER,I saw this movie a few years back on TV and only just found out that itwas available on DVD. It's not a particularly demanding plot but all ofthe perfromances are above average and it moves along at a decent pace.Also the bad guys are great (Michael Ironside ia always worth watching).Not a bad way to spend ninety minutes!
5,money saver,I only ordered one item but wound up with two. Since I have 2 MZ5ncameras it's no big deal. I'll save $ on only having to use AAbatteries and not spending $ for CR Lithium batteries EXLNT!
5,Wow!!,"This game is amazing. It grabs you from the beginning, and doesn't let you go. The ONLY complaint that can be brought against it is that it is too short. But however long it does last is crammed full with amazing gameplay, great graphics, and heart-stopping action. And bullet time is DEFINITELY one of the greatest features ever incorporated into a game."
5,THE PERFECT GAME!,"I gotta say. I didn't think too much of it when I looked at the back of the box in the store. I bought it, and took it home. I was blown away! This game is non stop fun. It doesn't get frusterating like a lot of other games i've played. The difficulty is up there but it isn't bad at all. There's nothing like using the bullet time feature to do some cool stunts to kill your enemies. I highly recommend this game. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!"
2,best all around game!,"I really did not think i would like this game. But, it is both challenging and fun. This is unlike any other game i have ever played. Worth buying most definetly."
4,"Welcome to ""Noir York City""","Oh yes, I remember this game very well. This is one of the most superb computer games that I have ever played. Along with its dark and gritty look, the game also has bullet time, which is very useful at times. The story is surprisingly good: even though I don't care much about stories while playing video games, I was really hooked with this one. Most of the characters are pretty much cliched, but I don't care. I just love the gameplay: it feels like I'm in a cinematic crime thriller whenever I fight against the enemies or use the bullet time. Granted, some of the music & the writing in the game is corny, but Max Payne is still an overall good game. A very unique game indeed.Grade: 8/10"
2,A little bit overrated,"Yes, i played the whole game, twice. For about the first hour, it was the greatest game ever, but by the time I got to the second chapter, it got a little repetitive. Max Payne isn't the first game to have bullet time, and it has a pretty run of the mill plot. Guy loses family, goes out for revenge, discovers a large plot by an evil corporation to rule the world... What's new? If you've played one action game you've played them all. Once you figure out how to kill one bad guy, you can kill them all. I don't see why everyone thinks this is the greatest game ever, its been done before."
2,"Too much story, not enough action","I can see why some people might be excited over this game. It's got good graphics and I can see that alot of time was obviously spent on the storyline and accompanying graphics. However, for my part I like games that concentrate on the action versus the cutscenes. It seems like you kill three enemies, find some ammo and painkillers and then have to wait through another cutscene. Yeah, the graphics are good, my compliments. But I'd rather have a game that's more fun to play versus worrying about how many bullets and shell casings get drawn in a particular room."
3,"Great game, just can not run on some computers","I liked this game--until it started skipping on me after 15 mins or so. I have a fairly decent computer (800 Mhz, Nvidia GeForce 2 card) and for some reason, I can not play this game for too long before it starts skipping. I also don't like how the game has to load the MAIN MENU!! and when I want to exit, it has to load to get out of the program.If you are planning on buying the game, make sure you have a fast processor and a lot of RAM."
2,"Very poor value, overrated.","One main gimmick (the bullet-time feature) and some decent graphics. That's all this overrated game really offers. And not only is it a 1.5 trick pony, but it's a very short one, too...you can finish it the same day you receive it.Suffice it to say Max Payne is just poor value all round. It's obvious most of the reviewers here either don't have the game or reviewed it while still in their 10-hour honeymoon with it. It's incredible how much a couple of days can sober one's opinion of this lackluster game. My two cents? Save your money and don't bother till it hits the bargain bin."
5,Why you should by Max Payne,"Max Payne is a truly glorious game. The other reviews have what i want to say except this. He is always constipated. Just look at his face in those screen shots. CONSTIPATION. In number 2 he's got rid of that though. Anyway, stop reading reviews and buy it!"
5,Nothing Compares,"One word ""Wow"". This game is uinique in so many aspects I dont even think I can list them all. First off the game overall is one of the best shooters I have ever played. The reason for this is because the story and action are so perfectly intertwined with one another that the game comes off as almost flawless. Remedy decided to take the shooter genre to new hights by adding inovating gameplay, including the awesome Matrix Style slow mo. The graphics and sound of Max Payne are amazing. Its really cool how they take peoples faces and litterally put them onto the characters. With so much action, style, and an interesting story Max Payne is definetly a game that NO SHOOTER FAN should miss."
4,Max Payne is ok,MAX PAYNE is a nice game. The reason my score is missing a star is because of the proluges to each episode which are very spooky and the odd angle everyone holds their weapons at.
4,"Awesome graphics, story well written","I enjoyed the shooter game. Story well written, graphics excellent, especially enjoyed the slow mo option with Max's movement-looking forward to Max Payne 2"
2,What type of gamer are you??,"Definitely ""Max Payne"" has a lot of innovations to show, technically speaking. The special effects of slowing time (the Matrix-style effects), bullet time, special dodge maneuvers are all unique to this game. Besides this it is quite a no-brainer of a game and quite a short one as well.Decide what type of a gamer are you... The ""Deus Ex"" type, where you have to think, interact, interrogate, read etc... in order to survive, or the Duke Nukem type where you go around shooting and shooting and ....Personally I was deeply disapponited in this game."
2,Payne to the Max: Windows 95/98/2000/ME,Don't but this game if you are running Windows XP Professional. I am running it on my machine and whenever I try to install it I am met with a frozen computer and no Max Payne. I thought it was just my CD rom until I tried installing it on another XP Pro machine and got the same problem. Believe me I have played and beaten this game. Its one of my favourites but save your money if you Run XP Pro.
5,Rethinking the shooter,"I recently played the red faction demo, which I enjoyed, but I found myself wishing for bullet time; the feature which slows Max's perception of time so he can wreck havok. While Max Payne may not be as inventive as others in terms of scripted sequences, charecter animations and A.I. it has made all other shooters feel like random click fests.The graphics are beautiful and the combat is much more satisfing than most other shooters. This is one of the few games I will problaby replay at least once."
5,"No Payne, No Gain","This is by far the best mindless game I've had ever played in ages. No puzzles. Very few of them. But if you are looking for great puzzles and side-splitting jokes, go play Escape from Monkey Island, which is the top of the janre. Max Payne is not for everyone. You should have some tolerance towards graphic violence. Even though the game is NOT about the puzzles, it has a solid story line. Play it for the second time. Then you will know what I mean. For all you games, just looking for good amount of bodycounts, this is the best game ever!"
1,Horribly unstable,"Let me start by saying, that I have a Geforce4 TI4600 graphics card, Pentium 2.0, Soundblaster 5.1 Xgamer soundcard, 1 GIG of memory, DirectX8 and a number of other goodies. Yet this game crashes every other time it tries to load a level, I finally got to play the tutorial after setting the game to low detail, the lowest resolution and turned off all the fogging effects. It plays the opening movie of the main game, but crashes when it tries to load the gameplay.It is certainly not the fault of my system...the tutorial was cool though. Seems like a fun game but unplayable due to impossible software."
1,Constant System Lockups - Patch Downloads Never Complete,"This might be a great game, but I may never know. In spite of having a P3 with 640MB of RAM and a 64MB Graphics card, this game has crashed (frozen) my Windows ME system three times in a row, as I've tried to ""play"" the tutorial. I've been trying to download a patch all day, and the miserable connection speed eventually degrades to nothing, and then restarts (thankfully where it left off). If it ever downloads and installs, perhaps it will resolve my freezes, but not so far."
5,Just cant wait,"This game is going to be great! With a minimum of 16 megs of video ram, you know its gona have some great graphics. You'll need a serious system but its worth it. The trailers are unbelievable! I cant wait for this game! Anyone who is looking for pure action thats not all flowered up, then this is the game to get"
5,If you liked Half-Life and Deus Ex - you're gonna love this,"Although it's a little short (10 hours), it's definately worth the money. I thought the bullet time would be more of a pain than anything - I certainly didn't expect it to be built into the game this well and to be so functional. You really have to play it to believe it. Not for kids though."
3,Great technology...but.....,"Okay....the bullet-time stuff is awesome, but it can get old after a while. With all of the realism in this game, you think they would have made the bullet hits more real. Shoot someone in the back of the head with a shotgun....sure there's some blood, but the head is still intact. I guess I was expecting to see a little more of ""soldier of fortune taken to the next level"" type of action. I'm also bothered by the third person perspective, which is really required for the bullet-time feature, but it would have been nice to have a first person option (a la Hitman). When I aim at a bad guy, the site line is blocked by Max. Just very difficult to move around and avoid the bad guys.....other than that, the weapons, the sound and the scenery is great. The story's okay...just a little to linear for me."
4,BRING ON THE PAYNE!!!!,"YES! This is what action game fans have been waiting for. For year we have watched ""Hard As Nails"" movies (Die Hard, Hard Boiled, Payback, Leathal Weapon, etc.) and wished we had a more ""involving"" experience. WELL,.... HERE IT IS! The plot is kind of ICK, but the mood and mechanics are AWESOME! This game is basically a collection of all sorts of action film signature moves and scenes (slow-mo gun fights, crack house, hero getting beaten to a pulp only to surface seconds later for revenge, the double crossing dirty cop and of course,.... the super powerful bad guy (girl?) with tons of money and conections). THIS IS NOT A BAD THING, but it does feel a bit un-even. Dont let yourself miss this what this game has to offer. It can only get better! PLUS, you can create your own MODS. The internet alone is working on TONS of MODS - The Matrix, Die Hard and Lord knows what else."
4,"This game is great, despite the problems...daaaaaaaaa","let me start out with the bottom line- THIS GAME RULES. I can't count the amount of times that I just got caught up in the gameplay. I lost all count of time, which is the primary symptom of absolutely loving a game. Whatever people that gave this game a bad review or simply said anything bad about this game, either did not play it or lack any sign of intelligence. Some flaws about this game are true: 1) It does not live up to the hype- This is only because the hype was too hard to live up to. 2) You need a very good computer for this, IF you want to play at the high settings, but it still looks VERY good on low 3) There are some incompatabilities with some video chips. However, this is still a really, really good game. I would suggest it without a doubt. Trust me get this game, and if you are like me, you could play this game over and over again. It is defenitly better than any other game out there, just short of real life. Have fun...."
4,Great game...if it wasn't so short and expensive!,"I got this game as a gift. I'd seen several ads for it and it seemed like my kinda game, but I wouldn't have bought it myself, and I still stick by that. Its a great game, don't get me wrong. Its just so costly for what you get, as I believe someone pointed out earlier. Its too one-way...there aren't too many other options you can do in the scenarios but die or go through that door leading to the end of the level. The only cool thing I found is what I'll do with most games like this...play it once, beat it, download the cheats for it for unlimited weapons and play it again, unfairly slaughtering everyone in my path. And this game is PERFECT for that."
1,"Started out ok and did get some traction but when the game's over, so is the fun","I didn't find myself coming back to the game as it got more boring after the first time. The tougher levels were not all that difficult either so I don't regret having bought a cheap and used copy and will be happy to sell mine and put this crap behind. Overall, the game's not worth the money and neither is the sequel. Don't let the liars and hypers mislead you on how really great either of the Max Paynes are. Get it cheap and used and see for yourself."
2,"Okay, but a total ripoff","This game ripped-off the Matrix, just like everything else. Bullet-time is so over-used it's become nothing but a fad. besides, Max Payne doesn't technically even use bullet time at all. Bullet Time is more than just slow motion while a camera swirls around a person and bullets have ripple effects. Bullet time is a camera technique. (catch that part, that means a game with computer generated graphics can not use it, because it doesn't require the use of a camer), anyways, its a technigues in which dozens of cameras, still and motion picture, are set in a particular layout, then each camera takes a picture simultaneously, or in succession in a rapid order. then the images from each of these cameras is peiced together to great a moving image that seems to move in a circle around an event. I lvoe how Enter the Matrix doesn't call it ""bullet time"", they refer to it as ""Focus"" cuz that's what it is. It's not ""bullet-time"" because bullet-time is simply a camera technique."
3,Way Cool until the novelty wears off.,"The ""bullet time"" effects were cool at first, but after the novelty wore off it was just another FPS with a mediocre story line."
2,Cheesy + vastly overrated shoot-em-up,"I just finished MP, and it only took me a day and a half. Judging from other comments on Amazon I'm not the only person to have finished the game in such a short time. The graphics are a real mix. The cool particle engine shines as a stunning example of what we can look forward to in the next generation of game engines, but the scenery and background art looks brown and dull throughout the entire game - think Quake2 without the aliens and you're not far off.The game's one ""gimmick"" of a slo-motion play mode is fun for the first couple of hours, then just gets boring. I wish they had spent more time on producing a story (it has every cheesy cliche in the book, and is presented by a dull expressionless monotone narration).The game was so gripping that I just had to go and fill in my yearly tax return instead. Don't buy the hype.. buy a decent game instead."
5,"One of the Best, Realistic, and Amazing games ever made",I heard some things about this game. One day as i passed it in an electronics store I picked it up and started looking. The game looked alright but for the price i was a little iffy. I said what the heck and bought it. Now this game is one of my favorites. The graphics are amazing. I cannot describe how realistic the images look. This game was worth every penny. If you like shooting games like GTA3 the i reccomend 100% be warned that this game is not for little kids.
5,I Havnt Played it yet but......,"Even though i havnt played it yet i have been waiting for this game for two years now. In June of 99 i bought a Comp magazine w/ a video demo of this game when it was supposed to be released in 99. From what the demo says it is based around Max Payne (duh!) and a drug called ""VALKIR"" (im not sure if this has changed for the 2001 release). I give it a five because in the demo you get to shoot up a really fat guy with a machine gun ( who doesnt like that!!!) I hope everyone that likes shoot em' ups will buy this graphically stunning game!"
4,fresh new shooting adventure,"Max Payne is a very fun shooter ,especially because of the bullet time feature (that Matrix slowmotion effect)it's very fun to play. graphics are pretty good ,the backgrounds are goodlooking and the characters are very detailed. the sound is also atmospheric and sets the game in the right mood. The gameplay is alo well done ,it's a bit like hitman ,you run and use things with your keyboard and you aim with your mouse and shoot with your mouse . The downside of this game are the cutscenes , as good as the in game graphics are as bad are the cutscenes ,hey are just comicbook pictures!with a bad voice over just ripped from an old B gangster movie. But all in all it's a fresh new shooting game . a real recommendation!!!"
5,Best Shooter of '01,"I don't think I've played a game this good in years. Every promise Remedy made they delivered on and then some. The story is excellent and delivered very well, interwoven throughout the gameplay but not once getting in the way. The graphics are great, especially the texturing (incidentally an incredible NYC Subway rendition). The controls are straightforward for any FPS fan and feel just right. The game is also very stable, it's been awhile since you could buy a new game and not have to worry about crashes or lockups. And the Bullet Time system is _not_ a gimmick. I can understand if people might expect it to be, I certainly had my doubts, but it actually works beautifully as a gameplay element and will get you saying ""that was so cool"" almost every time.Go ahead and order it up, its worth every penny. Kudos, Remedy!"
1,Do not buy this if you have Windows XP,"I have a brand new Sony Vaio Pentium 4 that runs on Windows XP.Despite notes on the liner and on the website on running the game on XP, this game will not run on XP on this PC. Their tech support are totally unhelpful, and I have found no way to get my money back because the box is opened!PS. I have talked to people who made this work on an HP / XP configuration-- good luck!"
5,Oh my god!,"This has to be one of the most fun games i have ever played! The gameplay is top quality, very innovative new features (like bullet-time) and a storyline straight out of a movie! Defienetly a 5-star game. I promise that this will be the most talked about game EVER on the PC since Half-Life. It has ""Game of the Year"" written all over it. Dont hesitate, dont ponder weither it is worth the 50 bucks. Order it by Next Day Air right now!! I promise that you wont regret it"
3,"Fun for a while, then it gets old real fast.","I had fun with this game and if that's all that matters then I would have given it a 5 star. Unfortunately, the game got old really fast for me. The locations are really contrived. I got bored with the places I went to and the enemies are so uninteresting. However, I really enjoyed the bullet time feature and the way the game handled lighting. Still, everyone should check out the demo at least."
2,careful -- these are not the original versions!,"Note that the track listing on the product page lists only song titles, not artists -- if you order this sight unseen, you may be disappointed to find that these are re-recordings, not the original versions of the songs! For example, Joachim Witt's ""Tri Tra Trullala"" turns out to be performed by ""Archim Britt."" Improbably, I found the CDs to be mostly listenable anyhow."
3,De Phazz turns Pop!!,"Reviewer: Esther Garcia from LondonI would hardly classify De Phazz latest CD as electric jazz. It is very far away from the innovative and sublime Godsdog. In Daily Lama De Phazz seems to be looking more at Pop music and Brazilian rythms than at those electronic rythms and mixes that made them famous. Songs look more conventional that anything else.As a De Phazz fan I have to say that I like the Album. It isgood, but it is not what I expected (something like Godsdog). So just be aware of it: a good CD but nothing new."
5,Fantastic,"Just discovered De Phazz and have purchased all their CD's. Music is an interesting mix of instrumental, amazing voices, somewhat jazz, electric, motown..Absolutely amazing."
2,OK,"Listened to it a couple of times. Vocal skills are average, not up to the professional level. For comparison, try the Die Schosten Deutsche Kinderlieder by Lucia Popp. This one is a great one sung by one of the BBC's World's Top 20 Sopranos; Popp is a mezzo."
5,LADY T. Has Always Been The Real Deal,I got This Disc Many Years Back&I was so Excited.Her&RIck James Have So Much Chemistry it's Scary.De Ja Vu(I've Been Here Before) Is a Wonderful Classic That Rick James Wrote.But Teena Handles everything else here.The Music Here is TImeless&Her VOice is UNSTOPPABLE!GENIUS NON-Stop.
5,Excellent Hard Drive,We purchased these drives to have backups for ones that needed to be replaced. They work well and are a faster replacement than what we had.
3,A nice start...,"The only reason I heard of Action Action was because a friend of mine took me to a concert where they opened.Afteward, I bought the CD from the booth outside for $12. It was autographed, and really, really bright.As has been noted, this band is not original. They are, however, pretty ""cool"". Though the artists look the part, Action Action is not ""emo"" in its mood or lyrics. Like The Killers, The Bravery, Duran Duran, etc, the band is more a punk/poptronica band.Standout songs include: this year's fashion, Druglike (my favorite), Photograph, Instructions on building a model airplane, dont cut your fabric, the short weekend begins with a longing. Yes I realize that is almost half the CD.Anyway, the CD is worth buying though it definitely is more for a punk teen kid crowd. I give 3.5/5 stars."
1,Just because you like Guitar Hero doesn't make you a musician,This band is quite possibly the worst band I have ever seen. I am pretty sure that only one of the three guys holding a guitar or bass on stage was even playing it. Each of them had their own synthesizer. These guys are very much Duran Duran-like. What a sham. They must have some rich parents buying off the Jagermeister guys to let them play on the tour. Don't waste your money on this load of garbage. The static on your radio is better than this trash.
3,"Does its job, but arrived in disrepair","I wish the description of this item were more thorough. It doesn't say how the long arms of this machine can be folded down for storage. In fact, the arms don't fold at all. You have to undo the anchors and pull the plastic arms out of the contraption. Fortunately, this is easy to do given that the arms are heavy duty plastic.The bigger concern for me was the fact that this item arrived with two screws loose. I was able to screw them back on, but if I'm paying $350 + $50 for this thing, I don't excuse these types of problems.Nevertheless, the machine works fine. I like that there are two hooks on the handle so I can place the metal basket there too."
5,A superb Jeremiad at the dysfunctional world of publishing,"I would happily give this book to all my starry-eyed creative writing students - albeit, in a brown paper cover. It tells the truth. It is hideously on target in its criticism of the ugly dysfunctional world of modern publishing. And it's great fun.I speak as a PhD and tutor in creative writing, who has been a newspaper editor, publisher and highly successful commercial author for 40 years. Michael knows his business. And (unlike the previous reviewer) so do I."
5,Ms. Williams gives the stone lovers among us a gift.,"This stunning look into pavement design of the past 2000 years is brilliantly executed--from the detailed drawings to the in-depth analysis of mathematical principles and design principles/patterns, this book is a treat for my eyes and my mind. In working on my PhD in the stone and paving methods of Rome (and beyond), I've found Ms. Williams book fills a hole in academia left vacant for far too long. You love architecture/history/church building/math/ or design? You must have this gorgeous gift."
5,A book which beautifully answers some fundamental questions,"Wonderfully conceived, researched and illustrated, this is a book which beautifully answers some of the fundamental questions as to the why and how of paving. When I walk through the majestic spaces mentioned in Ms. Williams book I will do so with my curious eyes glued to the ground for a change. Truly a fantastic book; a good read be it for the layman or as a much needed point of reference for the learnèd. The illustrations are almost as good as being there."
2,This could have been allot better!,"I ordered this item but when it arrived, due to a lack of checks and balances or inspection....it did not work! I regret this happened but I believe it was a mistake made by this e-seller. But after realizing what happened, I decided to change my original review of this company. I just need to look at reviews before I decide to order anything else unless it directly from amazon.com's actual warehouse. Just learn from my example before you buy anything from an e- seller on any site. I was a bit disappointed."
1,Last time I order from these people,This is the slowest company on Amazon to ship. 11 days is not acceptable. They never supply a tracking number until AFTER the product as arrived. They should be removed from the Amazon supply chain.
5,I use these to get my cats food out of the can and get the last bit of their costly food out.,I had been using an iSi slim spatula to get everything out of the cat food cans but the sharp edges around the rim of the cans was badly damaging the iSi spatula head. The iSi spatula heads are a lot longer than the head on these OXO small spatulas. These are working out better for removing the food. I am finding the small head useful for a lot of other kitchen tasks. The raspberry and black color is quite beautiful.
5,Marvelously complete reference book for collectors...,"This is an excellent book. The Mangus' have put together an exhaustive reference on this collectible pottery. They cover everything! From planters to figurines, from bookends to cookie jars, from the design lines to the kitchenware, it's all here.They include an extensive history of the pottery and its people (owners, designers, employees). They detail the various production methods used to produce the wide variety of wares. They include a wonderful section of photos of the various paper labels used by Shawnee (they used few, if any, backstamps or marks, other than the common ""USA"".)My only quibble with this book (and it's a teeny tiny one) is that the prices shown are high in today's market. However, that's not the Mangus' fault, as it reflects the impact that online auctions have had on collectibles in all areas and markets. The bottom line is, if you're looking for a reference on this fun pottery, this is the book to buy!"
4,A collector's tool,"This is a very nice book for the Shawnee Pottery collector. Every collector should use every available resourse at there disposal prior to purchasing Shawnee Pottery because over 50% of the items listed as Shawnee on our favorite on line auction web site is a fake. The value guides are not much use in that they do change frequently, but the photos and descriptions are great. This is just one tool you can use prior to buying Shawnee Pottery."
4,Irresistible,"The combination of bandoneon (a kind of accordion) and cello might not strike you as something to which you would want to hear, but believe me, this is a wonderful recording that offers great musical delight. The music, primarily compositions by Saluzzi, is wistful, playful, melodic, melancholy, joyous, and always expressive. It is a delight to hear the interaction between these two musicians as they spin out phrase after phrase. It is hard to listen without wanting to play along with them; you might find yourself brandishing and imaginary bow or squeezing an imaginary squeezebox. Or perhaps you will not play with them, but rather dance to their music. In any event, you will not be able to listen passively to this recording. You will find yourself becoming involved in some way or another. This is truly irresistible music!"
3,"Well designed music, but doesn't move me.","This music is beautiful and well-constructed and designed, but it hasn't spoken to my soul yet. Maybe it will."
1,Major Waste of Time,"I was very disappointed with this book; I bought it because I love Emma Bull's BoneDance, which does not resemble this one at all.I don't like Victorian books, or pseudo-Victorian anythings, anyway, and wading through the rhetoric and the letters in this was not worth the time. Unlike another customer review, I did manage to finish it, mainly because I was sick this weekend and because I got stubborn; I wanted to know what happened. But the ending was hardly worth the work to finish it, and the other reviewer might not want to bother.The plot does pick up a little about half the way through."
5,Wonderful!,"This is one of my favorite books. It is truly a book of letters, between the two main female characters, and detailing a distinctly un-traditional set of adventures that even find Frederich Engels as a minor character! This is also someitmes a very touching and erotic love story between two very complex, adult characters. One other reivew that I read said that it is unfortunate that the story ends with the heroine finding happiness in moterhhood and retreat into a secluded life. I think I would concur that this seems an unusual ending for Susan, who is one of the strongest and most unconventional female characters I had enjoyed in quite a while.I highly recommend this!"
2,Don't see what the fuss is,"A good start that promises much and then very quickly proves to be dull, ponderous and pretentious. In addition, there really is very little mystery or adventure and the ""fantasy"" component appears to be more of an afterthought than an integral part of the book. It was as if someone wrote a fairly dull historical romance and then realized it wouldn't sell unless ""mysterious ancient rites"" were added."
5,I need to start writting some letters,"What I love about Brust is that he never writes the same book twice. This is very different than anything else he has writen. The novel is composed of letters between the characters, their journal entries, and actual news stories from the London Times of 1849. This form makes following the story a bit of challenge but it is well worth it. Great job Steven and Emma!"
3,Misuse of terms,"After struggling with this book for about two weeks (And still not having finnished it), I must say that this book is not fantasy, but a fairly interesting book about English 19th century. Part of the book is very good, but some parts tends to be too long, and therefore a bit boring. As other perople have commented; this is not a book to read once, but I don't think I would like to read again for some time yet - there are other books to read...."
5,Dont' let the heft fool you,Be sure to give yourself time with this book - it will take over your reading time. Brust and Bull produced an excellent work filled with some of the best characters I've ever found. I'm happily midway through my 12th re-reading now.
4,Good reading...great art...,Enjoy the story but the characters and the artwork is better. A good gift for the admirer of the Dark in your life.
5,Great for car trips,"My kids and I love to listen to this in the car, a little of something for everyone. All the music from the movie."
4,Eclectic,"I enjoyed this CD very much. It is rather diverse and has many different types of music on here. The best track is Holding Out For A Hero by Frou Frou and for comedy, Livin' La Vida Loca with of course Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss-N-Boots (Antonio Banderas. I am a big David Bowie fan however but was dissapointed by the cover of Changes. I enjoyed his vocals but Butterfly Boucher is atrocious. One of the worst female voices I have heard in a long time. But otherwise a good CD."
4,Rich Price Rocks,I love the Rich Price track. I heard it on the web and bought teh album to get the full track. This is a super record.
