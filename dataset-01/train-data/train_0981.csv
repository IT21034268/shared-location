5,great soup!,"We love this soup. It's organic, low-fat, and delicious - one of our staples, and so nice on a cool day."
4,Feeling Lucky,Actually a very entertaining movie. The fight scenes are outrageous. Don't forget to turn on the English subtitles.
2,30 years Rabbit/Golf,"More of a picture book than anything else. Not many books on this subject, so if you bring out a book that's mediocre people are gonna have to buy it because they have no choice. That's what's happening here. What did I do w/the book I bought? I gave it to my 3-year-old Nephew, he colored in it."
4,A GREAT REFERENCE BOOK FOR BOTH NOVICE AND OLD PRO,"I found Boatners book (hardcover)at a garage sale about 10-12 years ago. I placed the book in storage and rediscovered it just before a tour of the Gettysburg battlefield. I highly recommend this book to the novice just getting started on the battlefields of the Civil War or the old pro who needs to refresh or jog their memory. Anyone that must have small details of any battlefield, troop placement and or commanders that lead them, locations of assults, you name it, this book is a must. Take it with you as you walk the lines of battle, its invaluable!"
2,"Lots of entries, not much information","When compiling a work of this sort, the author must necessarily choose what balance between number of entires and substantiveness they want to have. The more entries there are, the less thorough each entry can be. This work seems to go too far in the number of entries it includes. It's useful if you need to know a sentence or two of information about an obscure boat or officer or something like that. However, such inclusiveness only leaves room for a few hundred words or less on major people and battles. Since the majority of people are more interested in the larger people and issues, this limits the usefulness of this work."
5,A Terrific Game for Children Young and Old!,"This game is simply wonderfull. I bought it a few months ago, and love it! The characters are so cute, and the music is adorable. I gave it two educational stars, because there are times where you have to remember places where other chracters are, so it exercises your memory. I reccomend this game for anyone who likes Winnie the Pooh!"
5,Love this!,"Ok, you're thinking, Winnie the Pooh, this is for very young kids. Not so with this game. There is actually quite a bit of reading involved in order to really comprehend what you are being asked to do (which character your character is looking for, etc.). As a mom in her 30's, I personally enjoyed playing this game after the kids went to bed! There is a bit of memory involved, it's fairly challenging, and yeah, it's also pretty stinking cute!"
2,Okay - not great for non-readers,"Bought this for my six-year old; and although she can read some and we played it together the first few times, the rules in this game were a little complicated for her. It seems geared for younger children, then is un-playable for the same age group. Kind of disappointing."

5,"Sturdy, good quality",Not much to say other than that they're well made and seem like they'll hold up well. Can't ask for much more from a test lead.
2,Ummm Not a smart idea...,"I got this Beer hardhat thingy and was absolutely excited as I opened the package and anticipated my wearing of the item to the Metallica concert. Well, as I put in a couple of PBR 12 ozers I figured I would head over to the mosh pit and hang out to watch the mayhem as they played ""Master of Puppets"". I was then beat up with a black jack and someones boot. They even took the liberty to beat me down with my own hat with beer and all. They kicked me as I was laying on the ground...I will NEVER wear this product to Metallica concert again."
3,the AT200430 101 piece tamper proof/security screwdriver set,the screwdriver set are alright right but I didn't get the ratchet with it like it showed in the order mag.
3,good for the price,It would be nice if this came with a place to store the ratchet. Other than that it is a great item.
5,SUPER EFICIENTE,"Buenisimooooo...... se los recomiendo a todos los compradores, super puntual y el producto es excelente, tal cual como se describe en la pagina es como te llegara a tu casa,!! ami suegro le gusto su regalo, me dice que es lo maximo"
5,tool kit,A gift for my son. He loved it. Had all the tips he could possibly use. He liked it was in a case.The only down side was the little handle for the tips was not in the case so no where to store it.
2,You get what you pay for.,The quality control sucks. Several bits had the holes in the center off center. The case did not close well and some bits rattled around. I spent almost 3 times as much for my set but it worked the first time and will work many more. I do my own lock work and I use security/tamper-proof screws so these bits have to work. Save up and pay a little more.
3,ratchet does not have a place in the case,This is not a top of the line tool but it is worth the price. Stupidest thing about it is that the included ratchet does not go anywhere in the case. You'll have to use a rubber band or something to keep it with the bits.
4,Good product with one very annoying drawback.,"The tool set is of good quality but has one very annoying issue. If you open the case upside down you will find yourself sorting and resorting spilled bits for about 20 minutes. This problem is compounded by the fact that the ""top"" is not labeled as such...nor is the bottom. Oh well, a few seconds with a Sharpie fixed that problem.Unfortunately my 5-year-old can't read yet...so I have direct experience with the resorting as described above."
5,Awesome little kit.,"Like most of these reviews state, the case definitely has a little something to be desired. But it's all irrelevant since the bits are truly an amazing value. I mostly got this kit for the Torx and TR Torx bits but was pleasantly surprised to find an amazing array of all kinds of unique bits. So many different ones that some of them I'll probably never use. But who knows."
2,Not 4 Wii,"if you are trying to use the Tri-Wing screwdriver to Open Your Nintendo Wii, please do not Buy it... but if your reason is different, i will recommended to buy.."
5,Must-buy record,"Kamelot is one of those bands that are good in studio, but awesome live! This record is perfect from track 1 to track 18(first to last). All of Kamelot's best songs are there, and I claim that every one of them is better live than studio. If You plan to buy Your first Kamelot-record, this should be it!"
4,"For a live album, it is truly something.","In 2006 at the historic Rockefeller Musichall in Oslo, Norway, Kamelot came out to play..It will not let down a fan and will give newcomers a fresh taste of Kamelot.Note: Those who have other records containing the tracks, are best to buy the DVD instead, or just get both."
4,Adrenalin-Pumping Metal,"For lovers of metal music, Kamelot must not escape your radar. I only discovered them on Youtube, as their records are not available in stores here in Singapore. This is a recording of a live show they did in Oslo, which is also released as a DVD.They show that they can play live, which really can't be said of many bands. Kahn has one of the most powerful and charismatic vocals in metal and the other musicians prove their mettle as well.It's hard to find another live performance to match the standard of this one, other than Queen's Live at Wembley and Iron Maiden's LIve After Death. If you love metal, get this. If you have no idea of who Kamelot is or what they represent, this is the perfect introduction.Love it, absolutely love it."
3,I got the wrong book,"I got the wrong book and returning was too much work. i wasted my money even though it is not their fault, im still disappointed"
3,Ten years too old!,"Ho hum. Where to begin? Repetition is a problem in this book. Ten steps include three on main idea and two on relationships, so we are really down to seven steps, and that might even be too many. The examples are old and boring. I will read just about anything, but the short stories and essays are so dated that I could never use them in a classroom. I have other books by John Langan (English Essentials), so I know the author is capable. He can do better. This 3rd edition is in desperate need of an update."
2,Ten Steps to Building,"I communicated my dissatisfaction with the purchase, when i received the book it had water damage (not in the description). It was agreed to get a percentage of the purchase refunded for my inconvenience, which I never received. I am disappionted in the customer service."
1,Poor service,As I never received the product I will give a poor rating. We tried twice to get the book and had to turn to a different source and received it within two days.
1,SICK SICK series,If you wouldn't want this sort of garbage written about children then you definitely should not want it written about innocent and helpless bunnies or any other animal!!
5,Dastardly Fun!,"If you have a warped sense of humor, you'll love Bunny Suicides! How can you resist these cute lil wabbits trying to ""off"" themselves?!"
3,Confusing and Repetitive,"I'm an avid traveler and have had Lonely Planet as a steady companion on most my travels - granted I do a lot of exploring on my own, ideas for the budget travel are welcome...this guide recommends for someone with a big budget, repeats itself, sections are hard to find (bad layout), topics overlap and are repeated on multiple pages, creating too much reading and a book to heavy for a ""guide"" - what's worse it's not particularly interesting. I would not recommend buying and lugging this book to Seattle. Even the free map at the tourist office is 1000x better than the basic black lined one in the back of this book."
2,not worth it,I always choose Lonely Planets to go with me anywhere because they are easy to read and helpful. BUT I'm not talking about this one. As other customer said its layout was bad and talks about a lot lot of boring history. There're only a few pictures in the highlights section before contents. And the paper is worse than other books' in the Lonely Planet series.
4,Lonely Planet Seattle,"The book was in fine shape, except that it had a library tag on it, which made me think it may have been stolen from the library, unless you can purchase these books from the library."
5,Helpful story for young readers,"This book is a story about what happens when a child has a serious allergic reaction to peanuts. Far from being scary, it lets kids know that they can empower themselves by learning what to do in social situations and taking precautions when it comes to their allergies. In the story, Sam, the young protagonist learns that: 1) it's hard to be ""different,"" 2) it's important to be true to himself, 3) talking about problems can help, and 4) differences can be overcome. All the while, the bright pictures and readable text support the book's positive message. ... Sam learns to take much better care of himself. His mother becomes more involved and supportive. His teacher and classmates gain a better understanding of Sam's situation. Far from being ""outdated,"" I think this book is important and relevant."
5,The Peanut allergy review,I loved the story. I read it to my 4 yr old and 2 yr old over and over. My 4 yr old just started school so it is helping her to understand what she may or may not have to do one day in school should the occasion confront her.
5,Very Helpful,"My five year old son has food allergies and is starting Kindergarten this year. He is the first child at his school to have food allergies and I have been searching at the library for a book to give to his teacher to read to his class to help them understand. I read it myself first and was a bit hesitant to read it to my son because it shows what happens when a child has an allergic reaction (he was one when he had his reactions and obviously doesn't remember). I was afraid he might be scared. When I read it to him, however, he loved it, as did his younger brother who is allergy-free. I think it made my allergic child feel better to see someone else with the same allergies as him. I also think it helped him realize just how important it is for him to not touch peanut butter even if he is being teased. And, yes, I know that at some point in life, he will be teased because of this. This is a great book and I am buying two copies today - one for his class and one for us here at home."
1,"From a kid whose been there, done that","I've read this book and i'm a little bit disturbed by this book. I'm a twelve year old boy with severe peanut allergies. I'll admit i was a little bit of an outkast, but not because of my allergy! and i think that every peanut-allergic [allergic to anything for that matter] kindergartener has thought about eating or trying to eat peanuts. and this book ENCOURAGES it! i think that's a little dumb. thank you for your time."
1,I hated this book,"Horrible book. My son is allergic, and I thought this book would be good to have for him. I was wrong! I will never read it to his class. The book has a bully who teases the allergic boy for not being able to make a craft with peanut butter. I feel that the book gives the wrong message. I think it could give kids ideas."
5,I'm storing this one for future grandkids!,"This is a great toy! I found it at Winners and have never seen it again. I was going to sell this, but upon looking at it and playing with it myself, I may be convinced that it's a keeper for the grandchildren. Durable and solid, this is a great toy! The music isn't too annoying, it's actually pleasant. I have the composer, the extras and the walking one which I have been unable to find. (That one is almost like the corn popper we all had as kids and has two spots for the musical plugin's and when the child walks around with it, it plays music) Excellent toys!"
2,Lego Music Builder Composer,"Product doesn't do what I thought it would do. The kids get a kick out of putting the ""instruments"" into the hole, but no interest in creating music."
2,This was a disappointment,"This game didn't come with any instructions on how to play with it. You just plug in different ""instruments"" to create music. But the music is not cohesive; it just sounds like noise. Both my 2 year-old girl and 4 year-old boy were immediately bored with this. It is well-made, but it's frustrating keeping track of all the pieces. After only 3 months, I am donating it to my local church. I expected more from the makers of Lego."
2,Great book in an outrageous printing quality - avoid,"The book by Kubo et al. is unanimously good. The problem with this book being sold by Amazon is that it is yet another scam named ""digital reprint on demand"". You will pay 60 bucks for a book and will receive nothing more than a faded xerox copy in acid-prone paper glued between magazine-quality covers. Avoid. Or print a copy yourself! You will achieve a much better quality by 1/3 of the price. I am returning my copy. I am tired of being scammed by these editorial houses, that clearly adopted a ""take their money over the internet and run!"" attitude."
2,Not so good...,"My son and I were both excited about this fun-sounding kit but were disappointed with the outcome. The instructions make sure to warn you of the damage that can occur if the subtance touches anything (""damage can occur within 10 seconds...""), so that left me feeling a bit unhappy about even having it in my house. With that in mind, we did follow the directions perfectly and were happy about the tiny beginnings of a few stalagmites - or stalagtites - (I always get them mixed up) within the first 30 minutes. But over the next few hours there was no more growth! Instead, an ugly mass of goo collected on top of the water and the rocks that had begun to grow seemed to disintergrate and bleach out. Very unspectacular. The most exciting part ended up being figuring out how to dispose of the goo.Don't bother with this kit. Waste of money and time."
2,spend your money on another product.,Does not work as advertised. Dont expect the nice pretty picture on the box. Other crystal projects are better. goodluck
3,Okay.,Magic Rocks: Shark. Not as impressed as I would have liked. The rocks did not turn out as nice as in picture
4,A lot of fun but need more colors and shapes,"I brought this for my nine year old. She is very crafty and creative. The quality of the cards and envelopes are great,. However, it need more colors and shapes. It only comes in the primary colors not pink, purple or ""girlie"" colors. She says it also need more shapes like star, diamond, and hearts. She says it was difficult to make what she really wanted because she was limited to square triangle, and crescent. It included just common shapes and colors....She liked it overall, but need more shapes and colors. Nice thought to include glue, but not a good quality."
2,"Bad cartoons, worse prose.",It's a shame that the book doesn't focus more on issues that shaped the world instead of what was going on in the private life of a man. Battling homelessness? Welfare reform? The lowest unemployment level in years? No mention. This book is the worst kind of anthology of tripe.
4,Baseball History in a nutshell,I bought this along with the American League version. I like to pick it up and read about an older player or two each week. Interesting stuff. My friends who like baseball like to browse through it as well.
4,NL Deadball Stars,The product was shipped and received as promised. I enjoyed reading the biographies of the these players.
5,I Can't Read It Enough,"This is a wonderful book and I find myself reading over and over again. It is definitely not your typical Bertrice Small romance novel though the story is so intriguing, that it just doesn't matter. It is an amazing story of what this woman accomplishes in life by adapting to her surroundings. I love it even though I have read it so many times I am discovering errors/typos (and I still continue to read it). I have always been a big fan of Bertrice Small and this is my favorite book by her, I can't recommend it highly enough."
2,Not too pleased . . .,"I too started this book and thought wow, great, but the more I read it the more I was starting to dislike it. I kept reading though because I finish what I start and I thought it would get better. The beginning was great . . . captive slave made wife. ButI don't like politics at all. Just give me a good steamy novel while my husband is out of town. This book made me think about it and the characters so much when it was done that I had to remind myself that it was just a story. Gave me a heart-ache. Small is a good author, I just didn't care for this book amongst all her others."
2,Not what I expected,"Although the book started out good, as it progressed I found it hard to overcome the cultural aspects of being part of a harem. I had tried to accept and understand when Selim had the four kadins including Cyra and how they shared him. But once he took on a the entire harem and called many of the woman to his bed as well as had other favorites, it was too hard for me to accept as an enjoyable romance. From a historical perspective it was very enlightening and interesting. Had I set my expectations for a history lesson, my review may have been different.One of the reasons I selected this book is because of the reviews of others. I did not feel this was an extraordinary love story as it appeared to be from the other reviews."
3,Different,"This has been one of the first historical romances that i've read that the main character starts out a thirteen yr old girl who ends up sleeping with someone several years older than her, and frankly that put me off a bit, her being 13, but u have 2 remember at those times that was common practice. The book did pick up after awhile and I got past the age thing. There were a few other minor things that bothered me but the story overall was enjoyable it had ups and downs and took me longer than normal to read, and it's not one i'll be quick to reread, however if this book interests u buy it read it WHATEVER I know most times reviews discourage me from a good book (that if i hadn't tried myself i would never have found out)so i say experience it for yourself. U might might find a gem where i didn't."
5,The Kadin,This has always been my favorite Bertrice Small story. It is packed with action and historical characters. He descriptions are exquisite. The one thing that I had issue with in the Kindle download was that there were a lot of typos that distracted from the reading experience.
4,the Kadin,"I love the story - I have it in paperbook - actually I have most of Bertrice Small's books because I love the way she writes, her historical research and her ability to take me to a time long ago. I was very disappointed in the Kindle version - it appears that whoever scanned the book didn't bother to proof it. There are a LOT of mis-spelled words, some to the point where it affects the sentence.The Kadin, Janet Leslie's story, is a magnificent story of an abducted young girl who rises to the very top of the seraglio and how she handled the power that goes along with such a rise."
3,Many typos,"I read this book in paperback form several years ago. I was very disappointed with the quality of the kindle version. If I hadn't remembered some of the wordage from the print version I would have been lost. The publisher should be ashamed to let a book of this beauty be wrecked with innumerable errors. I gave it three stars because even with the mistakes in transition, the story is still a lovely journey."
5,"Ms. Small's best heroine, by far",It is true that Cyra Hafisse is a wonderful character and one that you will not soon forget. The interesting thing about htis character is that you will find her name popping up in other of Ms. Small's books. You will remember Cyra with fondness just as much as Esther Kira does. A wonderful read and a must if you are a fan of Bertrice Small.
2,Disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I found this title at my local library,it sounded interesting so i got. The book takes off to a good start and leaves you wanting more, until you get less than half way through.I was looking for a uplifting romance not some historical book. The love between Selim and Cyra was not bekievable to me, I mean how can you say your in love with someone and then go off and slip with other women and say oh i love them too......what kind of crap is that????? I can't believe Cyra just took it like it was especially with her supposedly fiery character.Beatrice Small writes well, but I just could not open up to the idea of sharing a man your in love with."
2,Not a romance novel,"I bought this book based on the reviews, and it was not good. I would not even categorize this book as a romance novel. I have read a couple of Bertrice Small's other books and loved them. but this was different. The book was very long, and actually takes place over a period of decades. I agree with another reviewer that the book is mainly political. I usually love historical novels, but the plot is extremely tedious. The book starts out interesting, but it increasingly gets worst. The polygamy stuff really took the romance out of the relationship with the two main characters for me. The hero loves and sleeps with his other wives while ""inlove"" with the heroine. But I could deal with that if the plot was better. The book was a bid disappointment."
4,"A touching, heartwarming romance","THE BRIDE QUILT is a delightful book that chronicles the growth of Madeline Preston, a 19-year old spinster who flees an arranged marriage to be a frontiersman's mail order bride. Unfortunately, Maddie is plagued by bad decisions (both her own and the guide leading her party out west), and finds herself stranded in the Rocky Mountain wilderness in the middle of winter with a snowstorm on the way. She stumbles across an isolated cabin occupied by a huge bear of a mountain man and his five newly orphaned nieces and nephews.Maggie knows nothing about being a pioneer woman, but she's willing to learn, and learn she does. Along the way she falls in love with the children and their uncle, who lost his wife and unborn child nine years previously and now shys away from permanent relationships. Their romance provides a touching and heartwarming story."
1,Abyssmal,A complete waste of time and money.Deplorable even by the own russian standards.Not worth your consideration.
1,Way overpriced!!!!!!!,Too much money for too little content. This is just another strength guru that nobody will remember in ten years. Plus he's a Commie!
2,Surely This is a Russian Plot?,"After reading this book and seeing the incredible price tag for so little useful information, surely this must be a Russian plot to bilk hard-working Americans out of their money and send them on a mission of useless training programs?As so many other reviewers have stated, it appears that Pavel's books are written in serial fashion to either 1) get you to buy more expensive books or 2)get you to buy expensive DVD's.""Take down that wall Gorby""...so those wacky Russians can experience the American dream by selling over-hyped books supposedly containing valuable Russian training ""secrets"".Comrades - save your money and your time! Search Amazon for some of the common sense, practical weight-training books, preferably by Stuart McRobert, Bill Starr and some of the old-timers who built massive physiques and strength without Russian ""secrets"", steroids, or other nonsense."
2,Not what I expected. Pass,"This book is mostly a waste of time. Pass.I used to like Pavel's occasional focused articles on variants of training, from plyometrics to kettle bells. I also liked some of the things I read on Dragon Door to shake up my training.This book is cheesy schtick with this ""velcome, Comrade"" tone, and chock full of training advice ranging from average to terrible.If you are looking to up your training regimen, you'd be much better off with HITT or I hate to say - even Bill Phillips Body for Life type pyramid regimens. I've even gotten better results from German volume training.Some of the basic ideas are useful, and I have had success with some of Pavel's older articles, so I'll be generous and give this two stars."
4,good principles,"I dont lift barbells, tried it years ago; and at 57 I probably wont be lifting them anytime soon. I do swing kettlebells, these are getting me in much better shape. But Pavel's book about using heavy weights applies to kettlebells as well. Weightlifting is weightlifting, and his advice is applicable for any kind of resistance training. Deliberatly using very heavy weights really does work. Be careful when you first do resistance training this way...but his principles do work."
5,Excellent book,"This is a book I highly recommend. The author has sound and unique theories on strenght training that I have used in my own workout sessions with great results. Truly one of the best books on strenght training I have read. - Rudyard Moncayo, Personal Trainer."
4,Great Book,I didn't find this book until the end of my first year of strength-training. I now consider that year wasted--Pavel teaches methods that work!
3,"Overpriced, but good info...","It's a bit too expensive, but if you're looking for information on why you should switch your routine to a high-weight/low-rep, deadlift centric program this is a good place to start."
2,Useless unless,"This bool from the evil russian is useless if you already own"" naked warrior "" .Good techniques and informations nevertheless ."
2,Expensive,"This book teaches you basic form of building power without gaining muscles and gives info about how to the basics, however it is expensive compared to the info like all Pavel books. Some positions are dangerous and nearly for weightlifters and must be applied very carefuly. If you have a problem with your spine never do these!!"
1,yawn,"same old pavel..too much advertising hype for his own books, too much laboured Russian humour(?), and not enough meat.There are no strength secrets. Just lift heavier and heavier weights, you will get stronger. Some secret. Is this man built?"
1,Save your money,"With 11 years of weight training for football and lacrosse I've come across and tried numerous different programs. I also review about three different books/programs a year. Each program's success was a direct result of the individual effort put into it. Pavel's book was an effort to finish reading. The principles are simple, you can find them in almost any collegiate and high-school football weight program. The book is dedicated to quirky and far from common examples of sometimes circus feats of strength. Pavel could have compressed this book into a flyer and also eliminated the final half-dozen or so pages of ads for his other books and products. I have no doubt that these techniques work for Pavel or others. Just don't buy this book and expect the secrets of strength to open up. For the cost of the book, many will be disappointed."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I enjoy collecting books on fitness and weight training. However limited the content may be, I'll keep the book if it has one good idea. I sent this one back. You will too,unless you feel deadlifts and one arm presses constitutes an entire workout. That is basically all that is talked about in the whole book. The book should have taken 2 pages not 80."
4,Interesting strength concepts...,"Pavel presents a few different ideas about how to build maximum strength without mass in this book. Constant muscular tension (even with light weights) and frequent sessions are just a sample. The information is good and while I think you can build a decent foundation with his sample program (using only the deadlift and one-handed press), I think more advanced trainees would like to use his techniques applied to their current routines. A good resource, but I agree with the other reviewer that said it's a little higher-priced for the amount of info. provided."
5,Practical advice that produces astounding results,"As a follow-up to my review from June of 2001: I still use the workout and techniques that Pavel recommends in ""Power to the People"" nearly two years after buying it, and I'm still getting stronger. Sure, some folks critisize Pavel because he charges $[money] for a paperback book, and he spends a number of pages in each book promoting his other books. But the bottom line is, his advice works...cheap for advice that you'll use the rest of your life."
4,Sensible strength training,"This book is great. No wacked out formulas, no insanity about TRAIN TO FAILURE YOU COWARD!!! and best of all no mixed messages. Overall this book contributed more to my understanding of strength and muscle than any other. I've also bought Russian Kettlebell Challenge and Relax Into Stretch. I can say, though the price may seem high, you definitely get what you pay for. The only reason it gets four stars is because I would like to see a little more diet info in it. Take care!"
5,Power is right.,"Do you really want to learn how to lift nearly double the weight you now bench?I did.I went from lifting ninety pounds, to 180 in just one lift.That's right, I didn't even wait around to try and build up to it. I just did it.This book will show you everything you need to know, and I swear by it.I've recommended it to everyone who wants to lift more and not build muscle, and there is even a section for muscle building."
3,"A good resource,but there are better for less bucks","I enjoyed this book,but for $[money],I expected a little more beef,and a little less fluff.Good sections on deadlifting and stretching..."
2,"Poor value, very little explanation of theories","I tried this program and soon became stagnant with no gains, even when using the cycles as suggested. I found out why it didn't work when I read ""Serious Stength Training"" by Bompa, DiPasquale, et.al.Pavil writes a funny book that proposes programs that may give you short term strength gains, but will eventually stagnate your strength. In addition, this program may not be good for your health as there is not enough conditioning work proposed prior to going through his 3-5 day a week training cycles of only two exercises.Pavil is probably fit and pretty strong, but I gotta wonder, how much weight can this guy lift? He doesn't say in the book at all--maybe for a reason. :-)My recommendation--SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,Ouch,"Guys, I respect Pavel, and he has a tremendous reputation in the power-training world. I was really excited to begin the routine in P2P, but it only took me three weeks to WRECK my lower back from the deadlifts and my right shoulder from the side presses. I'm a strong, healthy, 26-year old guy with about a year of freeweight experience. I paid very close attention to Pavel's directions, and still got injured. There are safer routines out there."
5,Amazing!,"I have to say when I first bought this book, I was skeptical about all the positive things I've heard. I figured...all this information in one book? This is too good to be true. But it was ALL true and THEN SOME!!!Pavel's information is invaluable, especially for the hardcore-competitive athlete. Read this book, then read it again, then read it some more.....I find myself picking up new tips and secrets each time I read it.Do yourself a favor and don't go another day without getting this book....if only I knew this information when I started lifting......"
5,Old Fashioned Training for the New Milennium,"P. Tsatsouline's book on true power gains is a masterpiece of intelligent and insightful writing for the serious strength trainer. The techniques described in Power To The People will have you increasing your pounds lifted from the very first workout. Whether your goals are strength- or size-oriented, no matter your current level of fitness, this books is indespensible."
2,Best info on proper deadlift form I have seen,"Otherwise, this book is good, but not great. It definitely has some good and thought provoking information, but it is littered with wacky anecdotes and advertisements for the author's other books. There is much one can learn from this book, but it is pretty expensive for the amount of meat in it."
5,A must read for Martial Artists,I've been a student of the martial arts for over 15 years. In particular Moodukkwan-Taekwondo and various other systems. Strength has always been a determiner in both competition and general training. Finding a program that emphasized strength and not mass has been hard. Until now that it is. Pavel has put together a great book. This book finally defines how to gain strength without adding the mass. I've added 30 pounds to my bench press with only 6 training sessions in 1 month. My deadlift has also gone up 100 pounds too. All of this without gaining additional bodyweight.I definitely recommend this book to anyone who is serious about their Martial Arts training.
1,A total wast of time,"I'm so sorry for my precious time that spent on reading this stupid book, if you are over 30 year old , never ever read this book ... it is for immature girls!"
2,Author Has Potential but Questionable Attitude,"Forgive us ""Country Bumpkin"" Midwesterners for questioning the attitude expressed through the protagonist in this novel. We may have to take our novel buying dollars elsewhere."
5,One of my favorites!,"All I have to say is WOW! I absolutely loved this book! Chick-lit in general can sometimes be hit or miss, but this book is definitely a hit. It is funny, witty, charming, and a quick read. At one point, my friends and I sat around flipping through the book while laughing hysterically at the heroine's advice for her great-grand niece. I actually need to buy myself a new copy of the book because I loaned mine to a friend, who passed along to another friend...I'll probably never see it again! Do yourself a favor and read this IMMEDIATELY!!"
4,Laugh out loud...,"Just finished this book on Wednesday; Love the ""journal"" entries, ring so true... recommended it to all my girlfriends!"
2,Not great.,"I really wanted to like the book. But, Charlie the character is very insecure and sounds desperate. She annoyed me. Its an okay fast read but not laugh out loud funny.I would not recommend it. The story does not leave you with any positive feeling or vibe :( If you want to check it out, borrow it from library don't spend your money on this one."
4,Funny- Must read,"I had never hear of this author before, but I am glad I took a chance. This was a easy read that made me laugh (aloud)."
5,"Great Read, Great Advice","I travel for business and hoped this book would not be dead weight. It was funny, entertaining and well written. Usually I read a book on my outbound flight and ditch it in a hotel room so I don't have to lug it home. This is a keeper to send to my sister. I read this in one day."
4,Very fun read,"I really liked this book. It's fun, entertaining and a fast read. However, with my being an English major, it irked me that there were so many grammar errors in the book."
3,Cute book but it seems like an unedited version,"I like this book and thought it was a cute plot, but there are many grammatical errors. There are many places in the book where the character is narrating and then another character comments but there are no quotations to show that person is talking and the lines are in the same sentence. I also noticed a lot of spelling and spacing errors ( and I am a horrible speller) that sometimes made following the thought processes a little jumpy. There were many instances i had to go back and reread something to have it make sense. I like the concept of the book but I was surprised at how many writing errors there is."
4,Read it in two days!,"I really enjoyed this book! This is one of those books that is just fun to sit down and read after a busy day of work. It's funny, the ""advice lines"" are a great touch to the overall story, and it just went by really fast! I couldn't put it down so I ended up reading it in two days. I have the follow-up book ""Misery Loves Cabernet"" and I am looking forward to reading that too."
3,OK...,"The book was a fun quick read. I only give it three stars because not much happened during the book. There was no real plot and most of the book was just the main character complaining about guys not calling her back and setting by the phone waiting for a call back, which got pretty boring after a while. I didn't like the fact that the main character seemed to define her self wroth by having a man, she never believed she could be happy or live on her own with out one. She really was just a desperate mess, however there where a few funny moments, but no real pay off in the end. Also her boss Drew was totally unbelievable as a mega super star he was supposed to be."
3,took a while to get good,"I was so excited to read this book. I finally got it and after the first chapter I was disappointed. Charlie got a bunch of phone calls and that was the entire chapter. I was worried the whole book was going to be her on the phone in her apartment. I read the next chapter though. It took my quite a few chapters to get into the book. Things were moving slowly. I never felt all that sorry for Charlie, but she was nice and easy to relate to. The best thing about the book was the list that Charlie made and Drew. He was a great character and although Charlie didn't really think his life was funny, if I worked for him I'd be laughing all the time. I liked the ending, but would have like to of read more. It seemed like it cut when something was finally about to happen in Charlie's life. There was some funny dialogue and situations. I don't know that it's a book I'll tell others they have to read, but it was okay."
5,Laugh out loud funny!!,The title of this book caught my attention so I downloaded the sample and was instantly hooked! I found myself laughing out loud often (getting strange looks from my husband) and pretty much ignored my family for a few straight days because I could not put this book down and had to read the follow up immediately afterward. My friends enjoyed it just as much as I did. I can't wait for another follow up!
4,A total waste of makeup~,"It is a very comical book and is a light, summer read. I enjoy the characters and the sheer craziness of Charlie's family. Don't we all think our families are pretty crazy? Well Charlie's really are and it will leave you in stitches. If you like romantic comedy, this book is for you! Enjoy !!"
4,Very cute!,"This is a breezy, entertaining and fun book that makes any cross-country flight go by quickly.Sometimes a girl just wants to read chick-lit, and this is VERY good chick lit. Loved the plot, which was described by others already. I'm not really easily entertained, but I really enjoyed this book. Pick it up today!"
5,Great easy read!,"I got through the book in two days with some time to kill. It was a page turner, thats for sure. I almost wanted to skip to the ending just to find out who she ends up with. I cant wait to order more of her books!"
3,Missing the sparkle,I was excited with the potential this book had after reading the sample. And after spendng more than usual on a new author I was expecting that this was gonna be as good as I had hoped. The story started out great and it ended but not with any great bang but more like it just burned out. It was missing the excitement and laughter and was disappointed before I got halfway through. The characters were lively but they got tiresome after a while. This is my first book of Kim Gruenenfelder and it will be my last. I did not like her enough to spend another ten bucks on a book that was just ok.
3,not a keeper,"i have three categories my books fall under. i love it enough to keep it, i liked it amd finished it, or i couldn't get to the end. most books fall in the second category so this one wasn't bad. it is just not a book i read again. it is quick and entertaining. the story has been done five hundred times so the author really had to hold my attention. i think she wrote smooth story and most will be pleased by it."
2,A total waste of time,"Although there were some humorous parts in this entertaining book, underneath it was sad and depressing. The lead character has everything going for her; a great job, family, friends, looks, money, etc. Yet she is pathetically unhappy because she does not have Mr. Right in her life. The book centers on her 30th birthday, and the fact that she is not married. I found myself hating the whining,complaining, sad Charlie thinking that she will never be happy in her life. Also, there was an excessive amount of drinking to the point where it seemed like many of the characters were in a state of constant drunkenness.I am sure it was meant to be humorous, but it just brought home the point that many of the characters where deeply depressed and trying to drown their sorrows with booze.The moral of the story seemed to be that women always have and always will define themselves by the man they marry. I felt that the boyfriend she finally chooses in the end lacked character development."
3,"Fun, but....","Once I saw the title of this book I knew it was going to be a fun read. The first few pages suck you in right away! Then, I ended up getting confused for a bit because there is a flood of new characters just flown into the reader's face. Once you get all the characters straight you can sit back and enjoy the book. There is some very witty humor with insightful thinking too throughout the book. I was confused about the Shaq bashing that was randomly thrown in, but maybe that was just me. It was a nice light summer read that will make you laugh!"
3,Was I reading the same book?,"Lightweight, choppy writing are the two things that stand out in my recollection of the time spent reading this book. In fairness there were moments that I laughed out loud, usually at some well aimed comment but overall this book was a disappointing read. Perhaps the author will improve in a second effort, I hope so since the character interaction and storyline were actually pretty good."
1,Ehhhh,Not worth the read. Nothing exciting or attention grabbing. Waste of my time. I wouldn't buy it if I were you.
4,Track Listing for CD Single,1. I Still Think About You2. Rock America3. Under The Gun4. Rock 'n'Roll Hoochie Koo (live)
3,Chesterton's introduction cut from this edition,"Chesterton is indeed at his best writing about Dickens. Before you buy this edition, be forewarned that the editors have cut almost 20pp. from Chesterton's introduction, leaving a mere 2pp."
4,Interesting,"I bought this because I had just read Dombey and Son, and wished to see what Chesterton thought of it. Interesting discussion and interesting to see which novels he considers great and which he feels do not succeed. He looks at plot, characterisation and context and makes some extremely funny and witty comments. As only he can."
3,A good interductery to the lighterside of whitchcraft.,"This is a good book for early teens and pre teens who wants to know more. it teaches about the meanings of such things as roses and clours, it contains simple love spells with information on witchcraft but is not for indepth learning. upon finishing this book the reader is left with a desire for more infomation. I recamend it only for beginers."
4,Phonics,I highly recommend the Phonics book. This book was extremely helpful with phonic blends for age appropriate and for the older child who needs review. It is very good for independent learning.
1,where is the song list?,Great!!! I been waiting for this and NO song list!!! WHy don't they just re-name this CD surprize surprize!!!!!
3,Caution: Missing Pages,"I was excited to receive my Laurousse Unabridged Spanish-English Dictionary. The edition I received, however, was missing pages 285-300. 'Don't know if this glitch is common, but I'd advise other buyers to flip through pages to make sure they have a complete book. As a translator, I'm looking forward to receiving a complete tome -- and it certainly is an exhaustive work and not for carrying around with you!"
3,Missing pages,"Yes, I read the previous reviews on missing pages and hope that I would not have the same problem. Unfortunately, I have discovered some missing pages. In my short time, I have discovered pages 61 to 76 of the English-Spanish section to be missing. Don't know what else is missing. I guess I will find out.Aside from the missing pages, it is by its very nature very comprehensive (that's why I bought it), and gives lots of different examples for most of the words. If not for the missing pages, I would recommend it as a desk reference copy (obviously not for travel). Who can I complain to about the missing pages?"
2,Missing pages,"I read about the dictionary having problems with missing pages. I just received mine and was dissapointed: it has missing pages too, the quality control is poor. Think twice before buying this dictionary, look elsewhere..."
1,A diatribe against the poor,"Instead of a book full of medical info made understandable, this book is, from start to finish, a polemic against welfare and Medicaid. It perpetuates the stereotypes of the Medicaid recipient. This author has so much anger against people, it's frightening that he's in this profession. Why does he work in an inner-city ER if he hates the poor so much? There is no medical information here, and all the stories are the same."
2,"Some funny stories, too much political ranting","I did laugh out loud a few times at some of Dr. Pezzi's amusing anecdotes (and the majority of them actually appeared to be true, though there are some well-known urban legends included). But the book deteriorates into a series of endless and repetitive rants against welfare recipients (sorry, Dr. Pezzi, most of them do NOT drive Cadillacs) and lawyers, often in the form of 3-page footnotes in eye-straining tiny print! I'm sorry I bought this book."
3,Give the doctor some Prozac...,"There are many books with collections of ER stories, and this one by a bright and witty doctor could have been one of the best. As an ER nurse myself, I can certainly understand and appreciate the cynicism of Dr. Pezzi. However, his ranting and arrogance detracted from the stories in the book and make him appear far less than professional. I think if he could step back and become more objective, he would get his point across much more efficiently."
2,The usual flaws,"Interesting account of the ER world, up to a point. Unfortunately Pezzi, like most authors in this genre, can't resist (or admit) including ""true"" first person accounts of well-travelled, decades-old urban legends as ""real emergency room stories."" I purchased this book because I was interested in reading about what goes on in an emergency room, not in reading funny stories other people have *heard* about emergency rooms.- snopes"
1,Skeptical,I think Pezzi wrote most of the positive reviews himself. They all seem to have the same tone and few of them are at all balanced. After spending some time looking at his web page and some of his other books (esp. the ones on dieting and penis enlargement) I fear that I will one day find myself injured and lying in his ER.
3,Too much advertising,"I was anxious to get this book so I downloaded to my Kindle. My daughter has been a Level 1 Trauma/ER Nurse and I have always enjoyed her ER stories. Dr. Pezzi's stories were funny to somewhat funny and I enjoyed reading what he wrote.HOWEVER, throughout the pages was a lot of advertising for his products and projects. One example was selling his plans for a shed shaped like a light house and another book on ""Advanced Enhancement"" (a book for ""Bob"" who we see on tv with the enzyte ads. And there was much more advertising of his products. I do not know if they are in the ""tree"" book, but they are in the Kindle and I did not appreciate advancing 1 -3 pages to get back to his text/story."
5,Cousin Johns first book,"John Hassett is my favorite childrens book author. I love his work, and would request it to anyone. If you like this book, also see ""Junior"", ""We got my Broother at the Zoo"", ""Charles of the Wild"", and ""Cat up a Tree"". He is an exellent author, and artist."
5,Great Game!!!,"I finally decided to get GTA Vice City. It was one of the best moves I have ever made. The graphics, the missions, sound effects are the best I have seen in a very long time. The missions are tricky yet keep you coming back for more every time. You will definately be hooked on this game for a very long time. The voices are also the best. I like the fact that you can buy your own property. I always hated going from one end of the city to the other just to save your game. With this property purchase feature you have an extra save point everywhere you buy a property. I recommend this game to anyone you loved GTA 3. I also recommend it to someone who wants to try something new. I don't recommend it for anyone under the age of 13 though. I loved be able to fly your helicopter and steal tanks. This is one of the best games ever produced."
5,"well, i love this game","this game on my celeron 1.1GB, Ati Rage Fury Pro 32MB machine is running between 5--15FPS, in 1152*864*16bit mode, in XP:)there used to be a serious graphic problem in the game, and i searched web to get solution to this: Textures Taking To Long To Load. i saw many people were complaining on this same problem. So, by the way, i will post solution here:All i did was set the compatability mode to win98 and checked-disable visual styles. Well that worked for me and now it run terrific.right click on VC Shortcutselect propertiesclick the compatability tabThis solution is important.when i solved this problem, i love this game as much as i love GTA3:)i used to hate this game before because of this problem, i thought it was too buggy."
1,"Great game, but not good to play on a bad computer!","GRAND THEFT AUTO VICE CITY is one of the greatest games of all time! But don't make the mistake I did. I've already owned the game on the PS2, so I made a dumb decision by buying it on the PC, where I thought the game would have better graphics and controls. I WAS DEAD WRONG! Don't buy this game on the PC unless you have a good computer! I have a Windows XP, so I won't recommend you playing games on this computer! The graphics are even worse then in the PS2 version, and the controls are terrible. What a waste of [money]! Don't be a moron like me, and don't buy this game if you have a [bad] computer!"
2,Really kind of stupid... not what I had expected,"After careful consideration, I think I'm going to have to go against the masses and say that this game was really kind of dumb. I was expecting a lot better. This was my 1st GTA game, and the last.Sure, it's fun to drive a car/motorcycle/ambulance as crazily as you can and run over people. Sure it's interesting to run from the police... for awhile. Sure it's different to fly a chopper. But really, it gets kind of monotonous. Quickly. After running around the town millions of time and failing some of the same missions, buying weapons and killing people on the street for money... you just find yourself saying, ""What's the point?""Oh, one thing though... KCHAT is hysterical! :)"
4,Same old same old,"It's pretty much the same as Grand Theft Auto 3. Then again, that's not really a bad thing, I suppose.The most notable new features include an 80's theme, tire damage, motorbikes, smarter police, and a few new interesting weapons.It's a good game, but if you've played GTA3 don't expect anything revolutionary."
5,gta,this game is very good . but i dont agree with the age limt i mean i no people who are 10 years of age. And play this game i think they should bring the age limt down and trust us a little .
2,Big Disappointement.,"In my opinion, this game is overrated. Some of my friends told me this game is excellent, but when I finally bought it for PC I was quite disappointed. The graphics are excellent, very detailed. The con about the graphics are the people. They all look the similar to each other. They really need to work on it. People are too rough around the edges. It looks so fake when you make Tommy Vercetti run. And when you see cops and regular people run, it's just too unrealistic. Same things with cars. They repeat after a while plus when they try to speed off, it's just too fast and too unrealistic.When you get a hooker you can hear and see the car moving, but when you change the view angle you can see the people just sitting. It would be better if they showed some sort of movement.Plus I don't like the idea of shooting the hooker after sex or going on killing spree and beating people into a bloody pulp.Yet, I found this game to be pretty addictive."
5,Grand Theft Auto Vice City,"The game is just a pure adrenaline rush. It's full of intricate missions and in depth character backgrounds and scenarios. Similar to The Sopranos or The Godfather, Vice City has the hardcore gangster image and feel to it. You are at the helm of your own criminal empire. Vice City continues where GTA 3 left offin terms of grapics and over all gameplay. It has a more fluid feel to it, an the plot blows GTA 3 out of the water."
3,Poor control,"It looks like I could really love this game. I've just been exploring so far, and I can see a lot of things to do. But, I haven't been able to really ""get into"" the game because controlling the vehicles is so touchy (even with mouse sensitivity set all the way down) that I can't keep a vehicle on the street--let alone navigate a motorcycle up a ramp at full speed. I've tried controlling with mouse, joystick, and keyboard with the same oversensitivity. If they come up with a patch for this problem, I'll spend many fun filled hours with this game."
1,Meh,"Great game and I really enjoyed it when it first released, BUT the graphics on the PC have aged terribly and I even have a brand new graphics card and drivers and it still looked pathetic, Vice City just doesn't do it for me anymore when there are better games out now that have move features and better graphics."
2,Will NOT run and a MODERN/CURRENT system.,"This is one of the best and most influential games of all times. There is only one problem: it won't run on a current system.First it didn't like my Video Cards; gForce 8800sIt can NOT adjust to my controller at all. If you use a controller that has an analogue system (like the PS1/ps2 controllers) it will not be able to accept proper commands. There is no way to invert or reverse the X/Y axis. So up is left and right is down. It's imposable to get used to doing everything in the wrong order. Half my buttons don't work even though the settings options can read them.The game refuses to recognize my sound card (X-Fi Pro) for what it is, giving me only bare mono sound. It chokes constantly crashing for no reason and freezing the system even though I have 8Gb of ram.Works alright on my old system, but that defeats the premise of a gaming machine."
5,The boat missions and the frame limiter,"Enable the frame limiter in the graphics settings or else the boat missions will be impossible. Failed the mission about 6 times because time ran out. Once I set the frame limiter ON, I did it on the first try. Once you're done with the boat mission, you can turn the frame limiter off and enjoy the smooth framerate."
5,You liked GTA 3? you will like this game!,"This is a great, long, and hard game.sometimes you will get mad on the ""bad"" guys, but this game is really fun!if you like games like GTA- buy this game! this isn't a waste of your money!"
2,Not much better that original,"Motorcycles are neat, but too easy to fall off of.The music is better.Graphics are too similar to the original.There are not enough improvements to make this a great sequel."
1,BORING,HORRIBLE GRAPHICS THEY LOOK LIKE THEY ARE ON THE PS1 not the PS2. It is also just like the older game nothin new but a new city!
4,One of the Best Games ever!,"This game rules! I can't stop pling it. The missions are fun, but what makes the game great is the freedom. You can go anyware in Vice City (Miami), buy any piece of property you want! Yes, ANY piece of property: clothing stores, wharehouses, night clubs, biker bars, and strip jionts. You lost your coke and your cash. You take work wharever you can find it. You work for everyone from corrupt lawyers to latin drug gods to redneck polititions.This is a great game to play when you are bord. If you don't feel like trying a mission you can just cruse around and listen to music from the 1980s.The graphics are beathtaking. Cars and boat are as detialed as I have ever seen on Xbox. Lush pulm trees and sandy beaches make up the sceenry of the game.There is so much to. Side missions with taxis, police cars, fire trucks, and more are avilable. Rampages are fun too.The only complaint I have about the game is that you have to hike all over town just to save your game at times."
5,This game is just plain damn good!!!,"Let me start out by saying that this game is a classic.This was the first GTA game I owned and I feel proud about myself of having this game.I showed off by showing my friends the game,and a lot of them begged me to the knees if I could let them borrow it.No way Dude! Anyway,this game is a gotta have,inspite it's intense gameplay,immensly realistic graphics,and awesome bloody actiontime baby!!!Get this game and have a wild time!!!"
3,Vice city review,"Want to steal cars?, deal drugs?, beat up or kill cops, without ending up in prison for the rest of your life? then try this game on for size, as Tommy vecetti you can do all this and more"
4,This is why I wanted a PS2,"I love this game but the graphics are pretty weak and the control of vehicles in the game are terrible. The boat is nearly immpossible to control. I guess I need to buy a PS2 style controller to enjoy it even more. More over the game continuously shuts down as I cross bridges back into vice city and surrounding areas, ""I have no idea why"" and you can see a lot of gliches. As long as they had before the release date I would have thought they would have corrected these for the PC. The game however is fun with the 80s tracks and it is a game you can play for hours at a time. A great buy, but have a good computer and plenty of ram."
5,Fun Game,"This game is very fun. i have it for ps2 and he plays it all the time. if you are a fan of the GTA series, you must have this."
3,Buggy with almost no documentation,"Don't get me wrong - This if a fun game but there are two HUGE problems with it.1. It's buggy, my XP system handles all my other games fine, but for some reason, this Vice City game gets it to freeze up every couple of hours of play.2. The included documentation is a joke. I haven't been able to figure out all the controls yet, much less what some of the in game features are. I should not have to visit fan websites to learn how to play the game."
4,mixed bag,"Yes this is a great game. That being said, if you enjoyed GTA3 there isn't too much new here. There are some cool new things but all in all its all familiar. Personally I totally dislike the Miami-ish setting. It's flat and boring, much like Florida. Liberty City was far superior. If you have a fast computer and a killer 3d card you will love the graphics. On my XP 2.0 Ghz P4, 1Ghz RDRAM, and brand new ATI 9800 Pro 128MB video card the graphics are pretty stellar. The game itself has no real customizing options for graphics, but my card does, so I'm running 6x anti ali. and 16x antro. filtering at 1280x1224. Looks great. Can't wait for Doom 3 which will really put my system to the test. All in all, I recommend buying this game. Oh, and if you haven't played Max Payne, what the h are you waiting for?"
4,Good plan book!,"I like this plan book and the flexibility it allows to draw your own lines. All teachers know your day and week can constantly change due to everything else that goes on in a school day. However, I prefer the old Rainbow Plan books that were horizontal and included literacy ideas along the right side of the pages. They no longer make those and replaced them with these vertical ones instead."
4,Great Plan Book!,"Love this plan book! There are pages for monthly planning, contact information, birthdays, and emergency info. This helped a lot for my first year of teaching!"
1,Intellectually dishonest,"I was saddened after reading this collection of articles. These authors display some of the most dreadful examples of eisegesis I have ever seen. Throughtout history people of all stripes have attempted to use Scripture to justify their view or cause and this is yet another example.An honest objective study of history, Biblical languages, along with a simple reading of the words of Scripture prove this book to be nothing more than wishful thinking on the part of another group who earnestly seeks legitimacy from Christianity."
1,Very disappointed with this little horse...,"My husband enjoyed ""Marvel the Mustang"" as a small child (back in the late 1960's and early 1970's) so much that we decided to buy one for our 2 1/2 year old daughter last Christmas. My husband says that this can't be the same toy that he loved as a small child. The spring action in this little guy is so stiff that not even my 10 year old could loosen it up for her little sister to ride on! My youngest daughter is now almost 3 years old and is very strong (weighing in at about 36 pounds), yet she still can't get Marvel to move like he is supposed to. She gets so discouraged with this toy that it rarely ever sees the outside of our storage shed. What a waste of money! I absolutely DO NOT recommend this toy!"
1,NOT FOR MY KID!,"When I opened the box the first thing I noticed was that there were no assemby instructions. As I was unloading the parts I noticed that the toy is extremely dangerously manufactured. It included metal foot pegs that have obviously been die-cut and the edges are jagged and RAZOR sharp. The bolts supplied to attach the head of the horse to the body are about a quarter of an inch longer than the receiving, pre-drilled hole so about 1/4 inch of the bolt juts out to the side of the horse's neck in a perfect spot for a small kid's face to hit. The ""ride-on"" toy can't even be ridden because the wheels are warped and therefore can't roll without shearing off slivers of plastic on the sharp metal wheel housing. I absolutely cannot believe that Amazon and ToysRUs sells this thing! It's like something you'd find in a bazar in a third-world country!"
3,Out of stock,"Well, after reading the reviews I'm glad this isn't in stock anymore. Like most of the other reviewers I had one a a child (got it for my 5th birthday) and remember LOVING it. In all fairness I have to say that most toys of that era probably wouldn't even begin to meet the safety standards in place today but I was hoping to get one for my son at some point and time (he's 27 months). So while the original may work fine (probably the one bought at a yard sale?) the replica leaves a lot to be desired. Too bad."
1,A Poor Quality Knock-Off,"Marvel The Mustang was NOT made by Marx Toys. It was made under license by some outfit called 'Amloid Corporation'. Need parts, help, a refund, want to complain? Call Amloid at 973-328-0654 x16"
1,A one and one half hour infomercial,I already own how to catch bass by john fox. It was very good so i expected this to be good too. I couldn't have been more wrong. I would give this video negative five stars if i could.This video is basically just an infomercial for bass pro shops.There are no tips that are of any use whatsoever in it. The whole video was filmed in the aisles at bass pro shops. If you like watching commercials then buy this video. If not save your money.
2,Not to bad for the price.,"Came used. Not bad for the price but not good either. Not sure if I really want to use it, considering how worn it is."
3,"It is cute, but could certainly be more eye-catching","If you like minimalism, you will like this book. Some of the pop-ups are nice, but with only black numbers on a white page, there is not much to attract a younger child. My 13 mo old thoroughly enjoys every tab, and flap of Chuck Murphy's pop-up books, here, most of them are blah, since they come with miniscule portions of animals, though some effects are cute. I liked the 10 butterflies, and more of the same would have been good! And while being small, the illustrations are not even totally true to life/realistic etc. as a saving grace. They look like doodles you or I might do on the magna-doodle!"
1,Disappointed,"Subwoofer didn't work, so this system sounded horrible. Couldn't get it to play any sound other than when watching a movie. Packed it up and sent it back."
5,Quality vs. Value,These rca wires are the best I've ever owned. They increased the sound quality of my system while keeping my pockets in good shape. The construction of the product is very good and the price is very reasonable. Recommend you give these a shot.
1,Dont waste your time,"I only bought this to see one of the designers, a friend of mine went out with him... its a stupid show."
5,ONE OF MICHAEL'S BEST,"This is one of Michael Jackson's best songs. It has a real groove to it and some very good lyrics. The remixes are better than the usual remixes found on similar releases (especially the Black or White remix). On a sidenote, the video for this song is also one of the best videos Michael has ever made, yes, including Thriller."
1,not the way to learn keyboard playing,"The keyboardist needs a knowledge of how chords are constructed and the principles of chord voicing and voice-leading. The many, many charts in this book don't help him get from chord to chord. For that matter, they are difficult to read and use non-standard chord symbols. There are many books much superior to this one. For ""tertian extensions"", that is, for seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords, I recommend Jerry Coker's IMPROVISING JAZZ. For principles of voice-leading I recommend Walter Piston's HARMONY (an edition prior to those co-written by Mark Devoto). For jazz scales I recommend Jeff Burns's PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST."
5,Someone finally did it right!,"""jane you ignorant (??)Kadmon has done what has never been done properly. For years I searched for a comprehensive guide of scales and modes, and I've seen `em all!! This one beats the pants off ALL others. Prime example: every other so called ""scale encyclopedia"" will give you (especially in the case of the exotic scales) modes of the same scale listed as a separate scale. You have to muddle through endless transpositions to discover that the Double Harmonic and Oriental are both modes of the Hungarian Minor. Hours of wasted creative time discovering that the Lydian Minor and the Major Locrian are both modes of the Neopolitian Major. I had actually begun this insane task when I came across Adam's book. What a godsend! The included fretboard maps alone make this book even better than any other Guitar scale book! The cord/scale relationship charts are priceless. And personally, I love the fact that none of this is represented in traditional notation."
1,Great Concept - Poor Quality,"I have at least ten products that I have purchased over the last five years to help me learn Arabic. The flashcard idea is a good one, but this set is filled with an unbelieveable amount of errors both in Arabic and in English. I stopped counting after 30 errors! Seriously, I don't know that much Arabic to even find close to the number of errors there must be in this product. I called the publisher (Tuttle) twice and emailed twice to request that I be compensated for this poor quality product. The lady on the phone seemed to take in all the information about each and every error that I found (thus far) and took my address and phone number, etc. Still, I have not heard from them."
1,Not good for beginners or use with Alif Baa,"I bought these cards intending to use them with my intensive Arabic course and quickly realized they were not useful at all. Our class began with the Alif Baa textbook and none of the basic vocabularly words from the book are in this flash card set's index. And I mean simple words that SHOULD be in a beginning set of cards, like ""door"" and ""new"" and ""when"" and ""water"". Maybe they are included as part of the ""related"" vocabulary but how is that useful to me when I need to learn the basics first? I'm not going to sift through 400 cards in the hopes that maybe these basic words are in there somewhere.I already had a set of Vis-Ed ([...]) cards and I bought the Tuttle ones because they have a larger font size. Now I'm going to go back to the other ones because at least the Vis-Ed ones have the words I need."
1,Espensive crap,"It's true, the derivations of the main word given on each card one of the reviewers talked about are of course a splendid idea. That's why I bought the 2 sets despite their price (22 pounds in London for each).But when I sat down at home I found out that1) the most basic vocabulary is just missing - no ""in"", no ""behind"", no ""good"", no ""bad"" - just unbelievable.2) giving you all the answers on the English side is just plain mad. You have to sit down with every card and ink the answers out to make this stuff usable.I sure wish I had taken even more time in the shop and gone for a different set of much less expensive cards..."
5,No one like Chavela,"There is not much to say. This is just one more great copilation of great stuff. Pure feeling. Her voice sounds the best in her last recordings, being this one of them. Tequila did a great job in fine-tuning her voice to that unique caressing yet strong, agressive, and courageous timbre that no other but Chavela possesses. Her singing can make you feel full of joy, and within the next two seconds she can bring you down to tears by touching with her singing those nerves you didn't know you had. That's how great Chavela is. It is too bad she retired and doesn't record anymore. But Thank you Chavela for all the great music you contributed with to enrich the good quality Mexican music repertoire."
4,Realistic models of evolution,"This reference will be useful for the general reader curious about Darwin's theory of evolution. As is pointed out, Copernicus showed that Earth is not the center of the Universe, Newton showed that motions of planets can be explained by simple physical laws, and then Darwin completed this Copernican revolution by showing that origin of new, highly organized forms of life could be explained by similar natural laws, in this case, adaptive variations and natural selection. Evidence for evolution comes from paleontology, comparative anatomy, comparative embryology, comparative ethology (animal behavior), biogeography (geographical distribution of animals), genetics, comparative biochemistry and molecular biology."
2,introduce many design reference but too few theory derivations,"the coverage was very broad on the GSM, DCS and WLAN band antenna design, and include the client side and AP/base station side. 90 percent is the case study and comparison of simulation and measurement. not for student's text book, maybe suit for experienced engineer for design reference and comparison. almost no theory derivation. just focus on the return loss,field pattern and gain. not wireless system integration in formation and topics.like a hand book not for beginers."
2,Pants probably nice BUT seller STINKS!,"The pants are probably pretty nice but the seller STINKS! Very ""loose"" about shipping and communication. CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
2,Batteries last about 5 minutes,"This camera is great EXCEPT for the fact that it drains the batteries very quickly. We sent it back for repair. They sent a replacement and the second one does the same thing. It's a shame because it takes great pictures and movies. It is easy to see the image you want to take. this was a consumer reports best buy the year that I bought it. maybe I just got 2 lemons, but it is a pain in the neck to carry 2 sets of extra batteries at all times."
2,Loved the art,"I adore the art in this children's book very much. I don't care for the attempt at sounding like Dr. Seuss, although I do like rhyming stories. This book does not have much of a story. I was disappointed."
5,Searching for a poet -- Found a poet!,"I've been searching for a poet for quite a while, a poet who could move me the way only Roethke could up to now. In Billy Collins I have found one. Imagine my amazement when I received my copy of Picnic, Lightning and saw on the back cover the identical sentiment coming from John Updike, although he says it much better than I could. ""... Collins writes lovely poems--lovely in a way almost nobody since Roethke's are. Limpid, gently and consistently startling, more serious than they seem...""Collins has his own voice, and a wonderful voice it is, but the feelings he generates in me are familiar--they're what I get from reading Roethke's Far Field and his other later works. My favorites in this beautiful collection are Moon, My Life and Aristotle. Buy it, give it as a gift, enjoy it.And to Mr Collins, please keep writing. Updike no doubt wants you to, and so do I."
2,The New Rod McKuen?,"As one blurb writer says on the back on Picnic, Lightning, Billy Collins is ""easy to love."" To me, that's the sure sign that this poet needs to explore new directions in his work. Collins, who impressed me with his earlier work (Video Poems and The Apple. . . ) has become complacent, writing poems that amuse, make you think a little, but ultimately leave you with that ""so what"" feeling. There is nothing in Picnic, Lightning that will change your life. Collins has become a master self-promoter and crowd pleaser, and, like a versifying George W. Bush, is quite skilled at taking no risks with what he says or how he says it. Collins has become adept at writing the ""Billy Collins"" poem, and people are eating up his work like Twinkies. Will we ever learn anything about Collins other than that he likes listening to jazz, reading, and throwing parties? I hope so, but given the lure of popularity and the six-figure book deals that go with it, I doubt it."
3,"OK, but nothing to do cartwheels about","Billy Collins writes enjoyable but fairly safe poetry that really isn't breaking any new ground. His work seems to be the current darling of 'accessible' poetry, the kind of poetry that NPR listeners who don't know much about poetry can name-drop at non-profit fundraisers.Don't get me wrong--this type of poetry has its place and there are some poems i really liked in here. There's an East Asian clarity to his sense of line, and some of these poems are truly pleasurable. But, really. This work isn't covering any new territory and it's not the greatest thing since sliced bread."
2,So-So,"I find it enlightening that so many reviewers said that they don't usually read poetry. Billy Collins writes for people who don't usually read poetry, but like to say they do. He is definitely filling a niche out there, but if can name the Schoolhouse Poets, skip this one."
1,The Norman Rockwell of verse,"Sentimental, easily digested valentines for the middling middle class. Give him a chance and he will kill poetry. A half-step up from Jewel, but worse somehow."
1,how on god's green earth...,"...did this guy become poet laureate? awful. poets of the world, take heart: if a writer this bad can make it, anyone can. my advice: save your money. go buy something good. if we ignore collins and his type, maybe they will go away."
5,phenomenal,"I had the privilege of hearing Billy Collins read this summer and it confirmed for me that he is a phenomenal poet with the gift of seeing the ordinary moment as a microcosm of life and the world. And he does it with great humor. If you don't normally read poetry or are looking for an introduction to the best of contemporary poetry, this is the book to read."
2,Horse tradin' needs a new title,"As a fan of Ben K. Green's I am constantly trying to find books that are on level with his type of fun reading. This book is not it. Ironically, the author addresses this at the beginning of the book and tries to explain his reasoning, he would have been better with a different title. This book contains articles that the author wrote for a magazine in the 60's and 70's. While the articles are informative and talk alot about AQHA bloodlines, someone with little experience in these fields will become very lost. Furthermore there wasn't alot of ""Horse Tradin'"" going on. Sure the foundation studs were passed around like so many playthings and alot of money was made, but the the verve and life of the stories is very bland. So, foundation researchers rejoice, western readers revoke."
5,Act 1 a hard act to follow,"Knowing from the very first time I saw this Video, I would want to see it over and over again. I decided to make a mark on the video protective case in order to keep a record of how many times that I had viewed the tape. I now have 79 viewing marks recorded. I also have bought a second BACK-UP tape just in case something should happen to this tape. I sing along with my tape and pretty well know it by heart. I'll never get tired of this special tape !"
5,hope I live long enough to see all of them,"Love the series, grew up with it. Hope I live another 15 years to be able to watch them all again. Please put them out quarterly to accommodate us old folks.Sincerely,Cookie Grandma"
1,Where was the editor?,"I can't believe this book got published, let alone that someone gave it 5 stars. One problem with reviews is that they are often written by friends of the author. I don't know the author and have no grudge but I do want my money's worth. The author's projects are very unsophisticated, both in design but more in their choice of color. The book is very expensive for the number of projects, and doesn't add much in background history. I would definitely say - Don't buy this book!!"
1,"Another leftist who loves Cuban Revolution with zero ""hands on"" experience..","When you see books like this there are two questions to be asked:1- Is the author been paid for the excelent and resourceful comunist propaganda system ?2- What is the motive of somebody that is smart enough to write a book and at the same time serve this kind of helping hand to a dying comunist system?by the way, i lived 27 years of my life in ""revolutionary cuba""....."
5,A Must-Have Book For The Newly Appointed Executor,"I purchased this book months ago to prepare myself for the future when I will have to handle my mother's affairs. To my absolute surprise, I have recently been appointed as administrator of my long lost cousin's estate. Yeap, he died intestate, without a will. Luckily I was just finishing this book so I had a clue what to do next.The book has already proven to be a valuable resource of information. As I go through the probate process, I am referring to it to help me along. I put Post-It note flags on the tops of certain chapters to speed up the information retrieval. The Table of Contents is well organized.The only thing I would suggest to the authors is to put a bit more ""how to"" instructions into the book. For instance, I need to do a Postal change of address. The topic is well covered in the chapter ""The Deceased's Mail"" but it does not tell you how to locate the Post Office where he once lived. A website address would be most helpful."

3,Just in fun.,"This one is a fun read, but not intended to raise your consciousness. Think of it as a movie comedy with a little salty pleasure thrown in the mix. It proves that you don't have to be a pornographer to love sex, a professor to get the inside scoop on academic shenanigans, a Baptist to - well, you read it and see.ENTERTAINMENT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE INTELLECTUALLY SATISFYING, folks, or the classic picaresque novels would have died and the printing press along with it. Tarloff can write entertainingly; just leave it at that, but pick up the book for some lighthearted summer fun. You won't regret it!"
1,"Blech, blech, blech","I wish I could say that you could enjoy Mr. Tarloff at least in short doses, but I cannot. Even small doses of his bombastic, cliche-ridden prose will get to you. Please forget the reviews written here by what only must be good friends of him and his family and try to focus on the objective ones. Or better yet, read the excerpt from the book and judge for yourself."
2,GREAT STORY POORLY WRITTEN,"This tale of Ezra and his efforts to keep his literary feet in both legitimate and 'illegitimate(?)' writing should be hilarious. The reader cares about Ezra and the premise of the story is funny and interesting - but the writer's propensity to write, to write repititious dialogue tired me out to the point I gave up in the middle, in the middle of the book. I have no interest in reading anything else by this author in case this IS his writing style. It's much like reading Mamet dialogue where, um, every word the character is to say, is to say is written. Works well for the spoken word, but not the written. Too bad, because I'd really like to know how the story ended!"
3,I found it VERY uneven:,"OK for a light, very light, summer read; some very funny situations and dialogue; but then again, the sheer cuteness of much of it was embarrassing, and the implausibility, if that sort of thing bothers anyone anymore, was . . . incredible. I found myself irritatedly screaming at the protagonist through a couple of hundred pages: Just do the obvious, what's stopping you, why hang around a go-nowhere podunk small-minded college nursing an utterly hopeless tenure case if you've got the publishing world on a string? And why didn't the author, the real author that is, make some effort to flesh out, as in let us read, some of that phenomenal best-selling porn book the whole thing was all about? I mean, only one non-descript line was reported: Nora patted her hair into a perfectly concentric bun. Hmm . . . maybe he knows his limits?"
1,So disappointed!,"After reading Face Time and loving it, I couldn't wait for Tarloff's next novel. Alas, although he started with a great idea for a story, and although he did actually tell a story - rare, nowadays, in novel-writing - he lowered himself to sophomoric, pedestrian, and, sadly, boring prose. Strangely, I liked Peau and wished that Tarloff would treat him more gently and humanely. Ah, well. I DID read the whole think and I DO look forward to the next novel. Please, don't let me down this time."
4,Monsters Inc. On Computer,Monsters Inc. was a great movie.Disney and Pixiar always have made super motion pictures.Then one day I thought of getting this C.D.Now the monsters will be right in my computer!
5,Surprising!,"I expected this to be a quick and perhaps interesting read, the title is sure catchy...I was NOT expecting this to be such an eye-opening book. As soon as the foreward, I was surprised by information that caused me to lay the book down and think about what I'd read for awhile before I was able to pick it up again. I would recommend this book to anyone who wonders about the status quo and wonders where we can possibly be headed as a society. Perhaps we aren't headed where you think..."
5,Teaching As a Subversive Activity,A classic for anyone in education.As relevant today as it was when published in 1969.
1,Puccini's Heroines: The Power of Love,"DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!! The only good singing is from the 4 singers listed on the cover and Richard Leach who is not listed on the cover, yet they only sing 1 piece each and credit is not given on the CD as to which piece they are singing. This site shows which pieces they are.Ken Nagano and his Lyon Opera Orchesta uses a singer who is the worst singer I have heard in a long time. And she sings 13 (THIRTEEN!!!) of the selections. And if you notice this singer is not even named here or on the CD. TOO EMBARRASING!!!!!! I plan on letting my students listen to this recording in relation to how NOT to sound. BOO......... Two thumbs DOWN!!!!!!!!"
1,grid iron man blanket,"this blanket is not worth buying. it is not triple thick, and it is not wash safe. i followed the directions on how to wash and dry it and when i pulled it out of the dryer it was unraveled! do not order this from any company because the blanket is all the same no matter where you go. i bought it for my boyfriend for christmas and now i have to get him a new gift."
5,Great Book for History Lovers of All Ages,"Adults and kids (grades 5-7) who love history will receive a lot of accurate information on the daily life of the Pilgrims as seen through the eyes of a school-aged girl. While this book may not be enjoyed by kids who have been raised on sensational, continual-action TV, videos, or books, it will be enjoyed by those who love to read and who enjoy a good old-fashioned book that is well written."
1,boring,"This was a required reading for me, and I was astounded at how boring it was. Many of the events described in the book were at random times, and it was difficult to get a good sense of time in the book. It was was more boring than any documentery that I had ever seen. Do not waiste your time and money on this book, you will regret it."
4,More than just crosscuts,"I've used several mid to high-end blades from various manufacturers and the one I find myself using most frequently is the DW3219PT. While it's designed as a specialty blade for tearout free crosscuts on thin stock and plywood, I've adopted it as my general purpose blade. I regularly rip stock up to 1.5 inches thick and get excellent results as long as the blade is properly lubricated and the feed rate is conservative. For those that need a clean cutting blade and dislike swapping out enough to sacrifice a high speed feed rate, this may be the ticket."
2,DIRT BY STUART WOODS.,"THIS IS THE SECOND BOOK STUART WOODS WROTE (WITH STONE BARRINGTON) I FOUND THIS BOOK BORINGAND BANAL. HAVING SAID THAT I MUST MENTION THAT I JUST READ ""DEAD IN THE WATER"" . THAT BOOK BY THE SAME AUTHOR IS TRULY ENTERTAINING. FANTASTIC READ,EXICITING, VERY UNUSUAL STORY.."
5,Another great Stone book!,Easy read and Stone keeps you entertained until the end! Stuart Woods once again keeps you in suspense and anxious to know what's next!
4,STONE BARRINGTON SECOND BOOK,"DIRT is the second novel in the Stone Barrington series by Stuart Woods. I know it's early in the series but I am enjoying it. Of course I like the Holly Barker and Will Lee series too. Woods cranks out these book and I am glad. Stone Barrington is an ex-cop, a lawyer witha private practice that really works for a major law practice to well, take care of then dirty little case. And in this book Woods establishes Barington as some ladies man. In this book alone he goes through his good looking lady judge girl friend, has a little spin with Amanda Dart, meets nineteen year old Tiffany Potts, and then there is the introduction of Addington Carter...even makes Stone think, Addington Barrington, oh my. This novel is about scandal within the gossip industry if you can believe it. Stone Barrington is great beach reads. RECOMMENDED.. On to DEAD IN THE WATER"
2,Thank Goodness it was cheap,"Would have been upset if I had paid very much for this book!!! Wish that Stone did less screwing and more detecting....hope that this trend doesn't continue, or I won't be buying any more Stuart Woods books. Character development in this particular novel is totally absent. There were some interesting bits, but they were few and far between!"
2,DIRT Review,I wasn't particularly excited by this Stuart Woods book. I've read many others by him and have enjoyed them. This was rather boring and very easy to put down.
3,Couldn't Put It Down,"I am a HUGE Stuart Woods fan, and although some parts of this novel weren't exactly believable, it was still a great read. Some reviewers of this novel have been a bit too harsh. Whoever said that you need to believe everything that is written? Can't it just be an entertaining novel? From the start, this book grabs you with the gossip columnist being harrassed by an anonymous person, and I love cop-turned-lawyer Barrington who is brought back to solve the crime. He is the epitomy of the knight in shining armour, whom every woman longs for in her life!"
3,"Man oh man! Is this the same guy that wrote ""Chiefs""?","I ask the question because 'Chiefs' was an absolutely fantastic novel. One of my favorites. This story is easy to read, quick-moving and entertaining but, for me, ultimately it is disappointing because I know that he could do sooooooo much better. If you've never read Stuart Woods, read 'Chiefs' and maybe you'd be better off just walking away.So, why am I irritated? The characters are two-dimensional cutouts of what we might suspect the rich and the famous are really like. They reminded me of unpleasant parodies of the Howells from Gilligan's Island. Woods can do so much more.To be fair, I guess I'm really irritated to see a man who showed so much early promise resort to being a hack writer, pounding out the same story time after time. I tolerate, in fact, I revel in it when it comes to Robert Parker. But in the case of Stuart Woods - what an incredible waste of writing talent!"
2,Not too great,"I finally finished this book after having to stop a few times. The plot isn't all too interesting and I thought that Woods could've done much better. It is a good book to read if you have nothing else to do and the suspense does build up by the end but by that time, most people are prone to have already gotten bored with it. It is not recommended for those who are impatient."
4,dirt,I always enjoy Stewart Woods and Stone Barrington. These books are easy to read and enjoyable. I like Deno and Holly Barker also add interest.
3,disappointed,I was a little disappointed in this book. I love the way Stuart writes but he now is having a lot more sex and a lot less mystery in his book & they are not as much fun to read.
3,Another quick read,"I recently started to read all the Stuart Woods Stone Barrington books. These books were designed to be read in order. Many of the story lines and characters overlap. You dont read this series for ""fine literature"" you read them for entertainment. The plot lines can be ludicrious, but that can be said of many of the modern thrillers these days. Sont Barrington, Dino and company are likeable characters. After reading many of these books, some part swill become tiring but its a fun ride."
5,It's never been more fun to read DIRT!!,"I found this book to be very well written. I especially like the fact that it keeps you interested by building up the plot all the way to the end. I was pleasantly surprised with this book. In fact, I have purchased Worst Fears Realized and Dead in the Water, simply becuase I enjoy the character Stone Barrington. I think that if a reader gives this book a chance, he/she will really enjoy it."
5,2nd in the Stone Bennington series. Keeps me wanting more.,"Stone's progression from Detective to Lawyer is moving along well. Even Dino is shaping up! Having started this series in the middle, compels me to keep reading all the prior novels til I catch up. So far, the plots are totally different and are great page turners."
3,"Wods--""Dirt""","This book was OK.. it was too repedative for me. It seems that the writine was rather ""boilerplate"" for Woods. Expcted moore. Would suggest it to someone who has not read several of his prior books."
3,Stone never gets dirty,As always stone is involved in another can't put it down novel.Thanks Stuart woods.Please keep them coming!Very good read as always.
5,Dirt is a great story,Its a typical Stuart Woods novel. I have read them all. It fits the themes he follows. I will read them as they come out
1,Dirt,"I read 3 other Stuart Woods books and loved them all, even thought I found them a little trashy. But ""Dirt"" was a total surprise to me. Very unmoralistic and the main character was not one bit respectable at all, minus a conscience! I will try one more book though."
5,captivating,"THIS WAS THE FIRST STUART WOODS BOOK I HAD READ. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CAPITVATING FROM THE GET GO. THE CHARACTER STONE BARRINGTON IS AWESOME. I AM NOT A BIG READER, BUT I USUALLY TEND TO STICK TO THE SAME THREE AUTHERS, AND IT TAKE ME ABOUT A MONTH TO READ A BOOK. NOW, ONCE I PICKED THIS BOOK UP, I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. I HAD IT FINISHED IN FOUR DAYS. WHICH LIKE I SAID IS EXCELLENT FOR ME. I LOVE THE WAY MR. WOODS WRITES HE GIVES JUST ENOUGH DETAIL, NOT TOO MUCH, BUT ITS ENOUGH WHERE YOU CAN PICTURE WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. I CAN TELL I WILL BE READING A LOT MORE OF YOUR STONE BARRINGTON NOVELS, THANK YOU FOR ENLIGHTING ME."
4,"very dishy, very fun","Super lightning fast speed. Can you deal with a lot of drama? You know, backstabbing, rampant sex, a murder here or there? This was my first Stuart Woods novel, and although his character developments are a little better in his other novels, I still remember this one as being one of the most campy and thoroughly entertaining ones."
2,This one is worth passing on.,"Stuart Woods can write novels in his sleep. This could have been one of them. A good summer read, but lazy in concept, thought, dialogue and information about gossip columnists"
4,Dirt,"I had skipped around with the Stone Barrington novels so it was nice to find the one where he meets Arrington. The gossip world of the rich & famous is very cut throat indeed. It was nice to see the ones who dish out the dirt get some dirt dished about them for a change! Amanda Dart is a real witch and as crafty as they come! I was amazed at how cold she could be, she is one of my favorite villians now!"
3,Not his best,"I'm a big fan of Woods, but I'm writing this review to say that he shouldn't be judged by this book, which is appropriately titled. I'm not sure he would agree, but his best book is ""Heat"", and I wish he would write another like it. All of his other Stone Barrington books are to be recommmended with higher marks."
4,another good barrington novel,"This is the third Barrington novel I've read and I have to say that Woods keeps the plots pretty interesting...they're not all just murder mysteries...now, that being said..there's some things that I don't like as well....Stone's morals are a bit iffy at times with certain things...let's just say that I don't feel bad for him if he doesn't have luck with the ladies =)anyway..I read this in about two days..the pages go by really quick and it left me always wanting to know what the next page held...very entertaining read"
3,"Vandalism and scorn! (Oh, and then there's the story...)","CLAMP, xxxHolic vol. 5 (Del Rey, 2005)There's something about the fifth volume of xxxHolic that seems to encourage lawlessness. My library's copies walked off, so I had to get it Interlibrary Loan, and the copy I received had a few pages that had been expertly sliced out. Go figure. CLAMP really seem to have gotten into this one in the past few episodes, as they follow up the twin-sister episode with some real crackers here. All the wackniess of the Valentine's Day hijinks in volume 4 come back to haunt Watanuki in spades (what does one give a girl who doesn't really exist on White Day?), while the episodic stories continue on as strong as they were in the last volume. Series is starting to get good. ***"
3,An interesting retrospective.,"Reading a book in 1998 that predicts the end of the twentieth century that was written in 1970 has its moments. Technology had just begun, and while pollution is a concern, the environment/ecology connection was not quite yet made. Some predictions are uncannily accurate, some of the things he predicts happened sooner, and some have not happened yet. Some of them, we have learned, should never happen at all. Some of them are not as dire as he seemed to think at the time.For anyone with an interest in a historical perspective of millenial predictions, this is an interesting read."
3,Leaf Clings,"Window clings are decorations not a toy for children, they can be used a safety for windows and glass doors. As a note window clings are not for the mouths of children and they can be ruined by cutting them or burning. They do make homes very attractive."
5,3rd Bass's swan song,"I must admit, it was a surprise to find this on CD. I had this on cassette single. I'm so glad I found it here. Thanks, amazon.com. It took me over a decade to find it on CD, which was in excellent shape if I may add. It took me back to my college days. ""Gladiator"" (before it became an Oscar-winning movie starring Russell Crowe), was a small film with Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ossie Davis, with a cool soundtrack. It was the swan song for the rap trio 3rd Bass, and its last good hit. You have no idea how happy I am to have this in my music collection."
5,Swing Big Bottom!,I lost my original copy of A Fiere Pancake in a house fire. This is a grand album of uniqueness!
5,Awesome books!,"I devoured any Enid Blyton book I could lay my hands on as a child. I still love them as an adult and will love reading my collection to my kids. As stated in the previous review these are a clean and thrilling read, thankfully minus the excessive violence and other junk many authors are putting out now. I dig them out and reread them every now and again even still and I'm nearly 22. The kids are all so full of fun and games that it's almost impossible not to laugh at their jokes and freak out when they do. Enid Blyton is a exceptional writer and I recommend any of her childrens books. They ROCK!!!!"
3,Low Budget Item - Could be improved,"I bought this because I needed an oversized garage door seal. This seal is not oversize by my reckoning, but the track will accommodate other manufacturers seals which eventually worked for me. A much better seal retainer design would be an ""L"" shape that fastens with horizontal driven screws. This one must be screwed in perpendicular to the face -- which, if the seal is installed on the track, makes for some challanging thought.It's OK for the money, but I probably would not do it again."
2,Didn't fill in the gap,"Not hard to install, but my floor is high in the middle and the edges don't seal tightly. Didn't solve my problem. Not sure it worked any better than a normal seal. Appears to need to be caulked between the metal strip and the door to prevent water from going in."
4,Great for wooden garage doors,"This product is just as advertised and is the perfect solution for wooden garage doors. Took me about 2 hours to unpack, cut to size, and install. Be sure to have a tool to cut the aluminum rail (I used a Dremel with a cutting wheel), and caulk the outside seam between the rail and the garage door. Pair it with a floor threshold for the ultimate protection: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WFTE/"
4,Garage door bottom seal,"Product is decent quality, although the packaging could be better, the rubber seal is wrapped around the aluminum channel lengthwise and the sharp edges of the aluminum ends ""digs in"" to the rubber. Mine had a couple of slight perforations which I was able to seal with some modeling glue. Be sure to break the burrs at the ends of each channel section to facilitate sliding the rubber seal thru without tearing. You will need 2 people to install the seal. I was hoping the aluminum channel had pre-drilled holes but they don't. Otherwise looks nice and am satisfied."
3,It's okay i guess,"This game is a great game for little kids, but as you grow up it gets boring because its not so challenging. its a good game for the price but all in all it is for little kids definitely."
4,Gallows Hill,This book was a pretty good book. I wouldn't say it was a great book but it was a book worth reading once but not twice. The plot was interesting and very creative. The thing that I liked most about this book was the originality of the plot and how it was set in the real world but it sounded like something that probably wiuldn't happen. Overall this book was decent and I would recomend it to any Lois Duncan fans.
5,The Review,"Gallows Hill was a real page turner. I just couldn't put it down. This suspense thriller was about a new girl who just wanted to go home. Everyone thought she ws so mysterious but she thought she was just a regular kid. When the most popular guy in school ask her to participate in the fortune teller booth for the fair she is forced into it by her parents. While looking into her ""fake"" crystal ball once owned by her grandmother she sees a deadly vision. These visions keep on coming and everyone thinks she's some kind of witch. To understand the book you really have to pay attention. Its got a big twist at the end and it takes a lot to remember how you got there. So read it and figure it out!!!!"
1,The Kindle version of this book,"While I agree that this is an excellent story, the kindle version of this book is so full of misspelled words that it makes it very difficult to read. Every page has misspelled words. I bought this for my niece to enjoy (and introduce her to Kindle) but had to keep helping her figure out what each of the misspelled words were suppose to be. In many places throughout the story, the word ""die"" is used where ""the"" is suppose to be. I also bought her the other Lois Duncan book, I hope that it is better. I'm afraid that this was a poor choice for an introduction to Kindle for her."
2,Very Strange,This book was exciting yet suspensful tale that was drawn out very long and strange. The way the events took place in this story kept it flowing.I thought that the best character was Charlie. He saved Sarah and I think it as daring of him to do that. The reason why the book was strange was because of the Reincarnation. The book was drawn out because the same events happend a lot or to many examples. This book wasn't the best book I've ever read but it gave me a great view on the Salem Witch craft trails.
3,"Intriguing story, but one of duncan's wrost",I have always enjoyed reading Lois Duncan's novels. They have always caught my attention and I was not able to put them down unfortunalty this was not one them. The book did not compete with other books by this author. The idea of recration was interesting but not to exciting.
2,Bland and Insipid - A Disappointing Read,"I have been a long fan of Lois Duncan's and have read at least a dozen of her novels. Besides providing great stories, her writing style is pure magic. Many times I reread her books just to listen again to the beautiful language. Imagine my disappointment then with Gallow's Hill - predictable plot, bland characters. It was a struggle to finish this book. This is the first Lois Duncan novel that I gave away after reading. I would recommend any of her other works - Stranger With My Face, Summer of Fear, Ransom, Down a Dark Hall, Locked in Time - just not this one."
4,An interesting piece of work,"This book was recommended to me by my English teacher, and I'm glad she recommended this book . I haven't ever read any work by Louis Duncan but this piece of work has interested me greatly. I really liked the way that Louis Duncan not only told an interesting story of a 17-year-old girl in a new town but the way she brought in the information of the Salem witch trials. I found the reincarnation stuff a little weird but everyone has their own beliefs on everything. I intend to read more of Louis Duncan's work...she is an intriguing author."
4,Suspense-filled!,"This is a very good book!!! At first, it was hard to follow but the ending is superb. Lois Duncan is my favorite author because her books make you think. Anyway, I absolutely love this book!!! There's nothing else I can say."
3,Hey...So Is Life,I read it. I dealt with it. I have read better. I have read worse. So is life. This story follows vaguely the type of subject of ' a gift of magic'(i mean that EXTREMELY loosely) but wasn't nearly as good. I enjoyed the book and it's subject but it was vague and standoff-ish..because it didn't get you involved in the characters...A gift of Magic was much better...it is still worth a read..if only to make you think (though i would not recommend it to people who are very strong in there faith and find the idea of reincarnation revolting...)
2,Barbara's Review,The book was ok. It wasn't the best though. It was kind of boring.Sarah and her mother have moved to Pine Crest. Her mother's boyfriend has a daughter who Sarah doesn't really like. Sarah is a fortuneteller in the Halloween Festival and actually sees something in the glass paperweight. Then what she sees really happens! She gets totally creped out. Eric thinks it would be cool to open a fortunetelling booth to make a little money. Soon people start to think that she's a witch. First she finds a picture of a gallows. Then she finds a dead crow! In her locker! Is she really a witch? What will happen to her?The type of person who would like this book is someone who is interested in witch hunting. That is mainly all they talk about nearer to the end of the book.
3,Hmmm..,"I'll give it three stars, for a couple of reasons.One - I had to read it for a book report, giving me no chance to take it, see if I was interested or not. Basically a, you're reading this whether you like it or not, kind of deal.Two - It may sound horrible for me, but it really bothers me how Sarah didn't die. Yes, maybe in her ""past time"" she had already suffered for it, or whatever. But I really had wanted the book to be a chiller, something where she dies and finally that horrid Ted realizes everything that Kyra and Eric managed to conduct themselves."
1,Paranormal Mania,"This book could have been so much better than it turned out being. I was not impressed at all with the reincarnation stuffed down the reader's throat by Ms. Duncan. I wasn't pleased with the portrayals of the Christians as evil-minded bigots, hating anyone who's different or doesn't fit in with their views of the universe.I did like the relationship between Sarah and the ugly duckling boy. Ms. Duncan is a better writer than this!"
2,"Interesting, but not very exciting","I first read Gallow's Hill a little over a year ago and i just picked it up to read again today and it barly held my interest. I mean, when i first read it, it was alright but i really think that Lois Duncan can do much better . This was not one of her greatest books. I really didnt like the ending to much, it didn't close right. All i was thinking was,""that was it,what was the point."" If you want to read a book by Lois Duncan, read Daughters Of Eve, or Down A Dark Hall, those were excellent books. You can read Gallows Hill if you want to, but don't be surprised if you are massivly dissapointed."
5,A Masterpiece.,"I have to say that this would have been one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fantastic and if you are interested in reincarnation, the Salem Witch Trials or the paranormal then this book is definitely for you. Definitely one of Lois Duncan's best works, if not her best."
5,I loved this book!,"I loved this book because it was suspensful. She didn't wright this book from a nairow point of view and I liked that. I like books with supernatural plots,and this one fits that description! This book has originality and charactor! Very good!"
5,This book rocks!!!,"I have just finished reading this book for the second time. One thing I can say is, Wow! This book has everything. Drama, suspense, romance...You name it, this book has it! I especially appreciate the colorful imagery, and the way Ms. Duncan blends all of the elements of a good story together. If you are looking for a good subject for a book report, or simply a fun read, I strongly recommend Gallows Hill."
1,"Adulterous parents shacking up in front of the kids,ruined it for me!","Ok,I'm sorry but I just couldn't get over the author having the 'married' father of one family sleeping with the mother of another family,in a book for Young Adults!The sexual immorality,covenant breaking,lying and sneaking around is just a horrible background for a kid's book that is just promoting such a disgusting lack of morals and character!"
3,a little limited but not bad,"It is a nice puzzle and learning tool but I think it's a little boring after about 4 times. Of course, it's interesting and a different spin on learning about the different places animals live. I think there are other puzzles that are a little more interesting, but not bad. I recommend it to a 2 1/2-3 year old."
3,British appeal of a coarser nature,"I love gentle, Brit reads. And after Blackthorn Winter, I was ready to get cozy for another. However, Turning for Home did not have the same charm for me. The young, central character of this story was all about emotional dysfunction with episodes of recreational shagging and discourses of abrasive ""effen"" language. If you are a lover of Pilcher and Willet, with a penchant for gracious and somewhat moral tomes, this offering may not be your cup of tea."
3,Not Quite What I Wanted,This was a little too sweatery and not jackety enough for me. Too slouchy and not as structured as the picture looks. I have other Marmot jackets I like better. I sent it back.
5,True Magic!,"If you give any young child a gift from the heart, let this be it.An incredible story of a girl's enexpected gift.Life is about sharing, and she bring this true to life."
3,Editing Issues,"I just finished the book and found it quite entertaining. I figured out who the killer was early in the book but that didn't bother me. I don't see reading a book as a contest between me and the author. It's too easy for the author to cheat, anyway.The real downside was the editing. Every page on my Kindle had words hyphenated that shouldn't have been. The worst was when Bubba described a greasy spoon cafe and then said it was clearly for lo-cals. I stumbled as I tried to figure out why a greasy spoon would be for lo-cals. Then I realized it was locals and not lo-cals.So, what would have been simply an enjoyable read became a pain."
5,Enthralling!,What an amazing book and so very wise. Nothing is left out. Highly satisfying and educational.
2,Not a good gift,"I bought this CD as a stocking stuffer for my step-dad who is a fan of acoustic guitar music. He didn't seem thrilled with it on Christmas day and I don't think it gets played very often if ever. It was worth what I paid for it, less than $5 I think."
1,It's freely available in Big Sur,"I'm a single dad, my youngest has just 'left', and I was in a great funk and did the usual search through Amazon. I don't know why I landed on this book, but bought it. Read/skimmed it in 1 day and, unfortunately found it completely unhelpful. Advice like, ""Think good thoughts"", ""Don't get depressed"" etc. did not really get to the core of my feeling bad--I felt like the authors were quite pushy in their advice. The good part of the book was the reassurance that I wasn't alone, but their advice for feeling better was simplistic at best. Anyway, there's a free library at Deetjen's Big Sur Inn, where I 'donated' it. So if you're on HWY 1, about 50 miles south of Monterey, stop in and look at it, and I think you'll agree with my assessement."
4,A Good Place to Start,"If you are interested in american history, this book is a great reference to have. It breaks history down by year and further breaks down each year by catagory. It discusses government, arts, sports, sciences etc. year by year. On the down side, each listing is very limited, so if you find something interesting, you first have to find another book on the subject. Still, as I said in the title, it is a good place to start."
2,"Interesting, but just too distracted","As a die-hard Sox fan, I am interested by any writing about the Red Sox under Theo Epstein, especially when it involves a new and different look at the managerial goings-on of a sabermetric franchise. And there are plenty of interesting tidbits and stories about sagas such as the Jose Contreras deal and the Kevin Millar signings that many Red Sox fans remember vividly. But I felt like there was too much background for certain players, too much focus on specific games. It's worth a read for die-hard Sox fans, but I can't really recommend it for most."
1,Skip it,"This book is the literary equivalent of the Bataan Death March. It's inconceivable to me that the author actually makes a living by writing. There was no flow to the book, which followed no dicernable chronology or any other theme. The author jumps from story to story within chapters, making no effort to link anything together. Too many characters are introduced, making it impossible to follow who was who and what was going on. Like wading through a bog of molasses.I really wanted to like this book, because I am a Red Sox fan. Skip it an read Moneyball instead, which is a masterpiece and a fun read even for the non-baseball fan. This piece of literary garbage (Chasing....) went on the bookshelf after I was 2/3 of the way through, even with a 13 hour flight from Australia at its disposal. Eeeeeek.bt"
5,Entertaining behind-the-scenes look,"Though the Red Sox finally ""caught"" Steinbrenner (for one year at least), the frustrations and challenges of being a franchise forever obsessed with the Bronx Colossus remain. This book is as relevant now that the Red Sox have won their World Series title as it was when the sting of Aaron Boone was fresh. Rob Bradford provides the reader an entertaining look into the sub-$200 millon world of Red Sox GM Theo Epstein and his Toronto counterpart J.P. Ricciardi, Massachusetts natives both, who work to overcome Yankee dollars with good old-fashioned Yankee ingenuity , and yes, luck. After all, Theo was heartbroken over losing Jose Contreras to the Yankees. It's all in the book.A good read."
5,Very entertaining,"Between the behind the scenes story-telling, and the details waiting around every corner this is a great book to pick up. It delves into what some of the decision-makers in Boston and Toronto had to go through over a most extra-ordinary season, not so much why the decisions were made. It is a great summertime page-turner."
3,Citizen Women's Gold-Tone Diamond Accented Watch,"I bought this watch because I liked its simplicity.What I received is exactly as appears in the photo.However, it is not a substantial watch. It is very light and that is because the links in the bracelet are not solid pieces but hollow.Inside its link there is another piece of silver color metal which only at the outer side of it is ""painted gold"" in order to be the same color with links.I saw the structure of the bracelet when I went to shorten it. For its price I would expect it to be heavier and for sure with solid links.Another drawback is that where the bracelet connects to the head of the watch, there is some thin metal pipe which is rather visible and cheap looking.Also the clasp is very difficult to handle since it has small opening. Not worth its value.Otherwise the watch looks nice."
5,Incredible Saw!,"Los cortes con esta sierra de 80 dientes, son impecables! ahora he descubierto que mi hoja anterior de 60 dientes, estaba desafilada. esta tiene un corte preciso, sin astillas que hace mucho más fácil el trabajo, dejándolo listo para usar."
3,Average Blade,"For a multi use balde to cross cut and rip, I whould suggest using a competitors blade that is thinner and has a lower friction coating."
3,good dvd,"this dvd cover the 2009 season, it has ""the road to the superbowl"" and behind the scenes footage from the superbowl. this dvd helps relive some of magical 2009 season to saints'fan, but i prefere the dvd made last year(2008) is better then this."
1,NOT what people make it out to be.,I'm not going to waste your time with a detailed description on everything this video lacks. I'm just going to give a quick list.1. Intensity: this video is not intermediate and definitely not advanced strictly for beginners.2. Repetitive: You do the same moves the WHOLE time.3. Horrid Soundtrack: Explains itself.I would not give this video to anyone weather they are a beginner or not. Save your money.
5,Great gloves,"I bought my wife a pair of these bionic gloves a couple of years ago and she has worn them out - literally. She likes the way they form fit around her hand unlike most gloves for women that are bulky and hard to use. If you have a wife that works in the yard or garden (or both) as mine does, pick these up and buy them as a nice little surprise gift. Well worth the price even when they aren't on sale."
5,Wonderful Bionic Gloves,"These are the most comfortable and hard working garden gloves I have ever owned, and I have owned several. The gadening gloves are so good, I'll purchase them again and I'll buy winter and driving gloves too."
2,Too short,The size chart says the size S gloves are for 6 1/2 to 7 inches circumference. My hand is 6 3/4. They fit fine in circumference but the fingers are much too short and very uncomfortable. I'm also surprised a gardening glove is white since mine tend to get very dirty. These are made by Louisville Slugger so I think they just slapped another label on their batting gloves.
4,Great Gloves,Only reason i did not give 5 stars is because of how SMALL the sies run. Other than that it is a great glove. Very happy.
4,Watch out for the brown Bionic gloves,These are well made and long lasting gloves. They protect the hands and are very comfortable. But watch out for the brown ones--the color fades onto your skin like crazy and it's very hard to scrub off.
5,very comfy,"I bought the first pair 3 years ago for my mom. She loves them so much that she even asked for a new pair last Christmas (and she usually doesn't ask for anything... that means, they are extremely good!)She uses them so often that they unfortunately only hold for one season.Can only recommend them.Size-wise they tend to run a little small, so if in doubt I'd recommend to take the bigger size."
5,Great for Arthritic Gardner,These are the only gloves my wife wants to use as she has rheumatoid arthritis. She say's they are very comfortable and supportive.
5,Funny concept very well executed.,"This book is a collection of spoof, ""Harvard Lampoon"" style, irreverent ""newspaper articles"", poking fun at some standards of the newspaper trade. What is particularly amazing about this is that not only do they fill an entire book with spot-on parodies of headlines, but in most cases, they actually write the article that goes with the headlines, and remain just as spot-on in their parodies. (In a few cases, all we see is headlines with fake ""see story on page xx"" tags.) The one way in which their parodies are NOT perfect is that they are actually BETTER written and edited than real newspaper stories; I found NO typos in the entire book. So not only are they hilariously funny, they're also COMPETENT."
5,All you need NOW,"I really like this book. Even though it covers things lightly, it covers ALOT of topics!! The book flows well and the chapters make sense(the way they were placed). Again, it doesn't duel deeply in to the meaning of things, but it is great as a fast reference. The people I know that have the book, usually use it for writing legals, but it contains alot of other valuable info. Everything from a small view of surveying in the past, to water boundaries, to order of importance on monuments.Really good book."
3,Another great Kem Nunn novel,"Another great surfing novel by Kem Nunn. If you enjoyed ""Tapping The Source"", this one is a must read!"
3,disappointing from a surfing aspect,"Hmmmmm, the greatest novel ever written about surfing?? I don't think so. From what I read the surfers only rode three, maybe four waves during the whole book. I can understand The Search for the mysto spot, anyone who surfs, skis, rides mtn bikes or anything else outdoors is always searching for that magic place. This book seemed more directed at native internal affairs, penis piercings and murder. Yeah, it was a good book for murder mystery enthusiasts, but I found if disappointing from a surfing angle."
2,Disappointing,"The author is an very good stylist, but the story and the thematic development in ""The Dogs of Winter"" are lacking, in my view. There is far too much reliance on outlandish characters or events, and it seems to me that the novel has very little to say about the human condition."
2,How did nobody catch this?,"The story seemed to drag and drag on. Just when you think its over another competely obvious cliche unfolds. I guess the thing that bumms me out the most about this story is the negative image attatched to the natives. How much time Nunn has spent researching the reservations ""Up North"" is disputable. I realize that this is a work of fiction, but Nunn seems to add flair by pumping up the negative meth lab stereotype which he so readily attatches to the local tribes. NOT COOL. Oh yea, and the title of the third book is a dead give-away to the big finale. Tear it out so you don't see the ending 100 pages early.And if your someone who wants to read about surf adventures that are (in my opinion) better and non-fiction, pick up Allen Weisbeckers book ""In search of Captain Zero."""
2,Not so hot!,"Please be aware I haven't read this book, but my husband did...and this is what he told me: Not a very good book! Not only is the author a mediocre writer at best, but the story is lacking in authenticity. My husband has lived and seriously surfed in Northern California since 1984 (Humboldt County). He thought the book was not genuine, but rather ""puffed up."" A much better book of this type to read, according to him, is ""Caught Inside""...check that one out is my suggestion!"
3,Strong surfing story marred by too complicated plot,"The Dogs of Winter starts off well. We meet an aging surf photographer who has a chance to seek out a mystical hidden cove where the perfect wave is said to come in. Nunn is an expert on surfing and all the color he provides makes for an entertaining read.However, once they set out on their trip, we find ourselves in Indian country, which is just as much a symbol for the unknown as it is Indian country. Then Nunn throws in some meth-cookers, some seriously angry Indians, and a lot of back plots that aren't well articulated. The ending is a bit of a mismash.I would encourage anyone considering this book to turn to his much stronger Tapping the Source (see my review.) It is a much more focused work, and has plenty of surfer lore in it as well."
3,Surf...Sex...and Pot...gimme more!,The first novel I've read since high school (75). I wanted more surf and less twist...but overall a good read for a winter day in Santa Cruz. The author has the knack...to keep you guessing what's around the bend. A must read for the land locked surfer.
2,Not near as good as Tapping The Source,"Only towards the end did the story finally pick up. The book spent too much time trying to establish the characters, but even then, didn't really seem to. Not a surfer's book, but rather a book that has some surfing in it - almost as a by-line"
5,Students loved doing these plays,"A year ago I was looking to do some technology projects with my students and started looking for some scripts online. I came across this book and got it at the library. I split into 4 groups and had them practice, then had them record their parts and their sound effects on Garage Band. Since these were second graders, I did all the editing myself, but the end product was mesmerizing. I used their advice on music and found all of the direction most helpful. I was able to post it to the web for the listening enjoyment of parents and kids alike. The kids' favorite one was the funny sci fi, but Night on Bear Mountain they also enjoyed.I would love them to do another book of similiar scripts for younger students and also another one at this higher level. As an old time radio fan there was nothing like hearing these radio shows that we had performed ourselves."
3,Men's Watch,"I bought this for my son and he liked all the functions on it, but the instructions were very confusing and we still have not been able to figure out how to turn the alarm completely off. We have set it to go off at midnight so that it is not going off in the classroom."
5,Great education,"EW Bullinger does a wonderful job in connecting the stars with the Truth being the Work of God. He is able to explain the importance of signs and wonders we 'watchers' are directed to look for. Thank you for having the kindle addiion although and I agree with former posts that the Kregiel publisher is the best. ,m"
4,good book,Although the book is a good book with a lot of information that tends to be on the very technical side. Studying the history and origin of the names of the constellations and the stars therein. Gospel and the stars is an easier read.
5,The true believer,"E.W. Bullinger, a scholar of scholars has touched my life with his Figures of Speech in the Bible and Numbers in Scripture - a must for any serious Bible student. And with his ""Witness of the Stars"" he has shown GOD's grand design is before our eyes in a narrated story that 'all the world has seen'."
4,A Different Perspective on the Zodiac,"The Witness of the Stars gives readers a different perspective on the zodiac. Using the verse ""the heavens declare the glory of God,"" the book traces the gospel message through the 12 signs of the zodiac and their related constellations. Since it's over 100 years old, the writing style is a little different than what contemporary readers are used to. Still, it's worth a read to consider what it has to teach."
5,We are not alone,"This book definately gave me further insight into the Signs above and the timing of events recorded in Scripture. A timeless classic and an endearing topic. Well done, Dr Bullinger!"
4,Witness of the Stars,"Despite fundamentalist Christian prejudice, any book that interprets the meanings of the stars and planets for life on earth is ASTROLOGY! And astrologers are not sinners, the Bible is filled with astrological references and symbolism that only a student of astrology would recognize. The Book of Revelation in particular is loaded with astrological symbolism. And don't forget, that the 3 Magi who first visited the Christ child, were Astrologers!!"
5,Evidence of God,You want untouched evidence of God. Read this historical account in the stars from ancient civilizations on the message God sent back then to us.
1,XL Max-4 Russell Bib Overalls,Hi i really want a pair of the XL max-4 bib overalls when will you have some more available? Thank you.
5,Lightweight and comfortable,This was a present and the receiver was elated and said it was very comfortable and warm to go hunting.
4,a little to long,"i like the way they feel but i wear a large and in roundness they are great but i am 5' 7"" tall and these are about 3 "" to long. other than that they are a 5 star for comfort and wear.i still would have a friend buy a pair just get the length right."
2,Disappointed,"They are not for cold weather. Although, I'm not sure why you would want bibs for tepid weather. My husband was dials appointed with the insulative quality of these bibs"
4,Essential Reference for the Scarred Lands,"With all the cross-referencing on the screen itself, I would have to see that this is the best DM Screen I've seen in all my years of gaming. The booklet itself is absolutely necessary to run Scarred Lands not for the adventures, which are not all that great but for the information on the various races of Ghelspad, the main continent used for the adventures in this campaign setting. Between these few pages and the sheer versatility of the screen itself, it's very much worth getting. The adventures are short little nubs good for filler or for when the big adventure you, the DM have been plotting and crafting for a whole week gets flat out rejected or by passed by the characters and you need something quick to fill in. But again, you'll use the reference material in the front a lot more than the adventures and the screen is a DM's little helper par excellant."
3,ok,"this is a good live show at a great point in Neil's career, but the show is short and Cowgirl In The Sand is not a good version - the bass is way out of tune and completely unlistenable."
3,Neil Young,A good addition to a collection if like me you have come late to Neil Young but not wishing to back collect everything he has produced.
3,bad marketing,I was elated to be able to see the songs from the Fillmore East performed live on dvd. Devastated and pissed when I got still photos instead. DVD means live footage! Buy the cd version and don't get ripped off by this crappy dvd version. I feel like I bought snake oil.
2,Neil Young at the Fillmore East 1970,"Disappointing CD in that it only contained 7 songs and the quality of the performance was far below the original recordings and, also, other Neil Young live performances of the '70's. I have been to the Fillmore East and many of their late shows went on till 5 in the morning with incredibly long jams and some of the best live music of that era. Sadly, this was not one of them. I purchased it on Neil's name only and the venue, expecting much more in terms of quality and quantity. Would return this purchase if this were permissable."
2,old tapes,I found this recording disappointing....the sonics are ok but say compared to the Allman's at this venue...it pales....it's interesting to hear Young in this incarnation...most of the songs mirror his Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere album... his redwoods backdrop..dog sitting there...pendleton shirt...it captures that time...just wish it sounded better...this is the 21st century...not eight track heaven...
3,Unhappy,"Why would Amazon ask me to review something I never received? I ordered this item from a ""z"" merchant. After waiting the suggested 3 weeks to receive it, I reported the failure to receive to Amazon. Amazon's response was to wait 2 more weeks. Eight weeks later and I still haven't received it. At least the merchant finally acknowledged that fact and credited my payment back. I'm not sure Amazon has realized it yet.Regarding the actual CD, I'm sure it's good; however, I'll have to purchase it somewhere else to find out."
3,AM I MISSING SOMETHING,"I have listened to this CD quite a few times now. The previous reviews are just gushing. As for me, its a novelty. Did I enjoy listening once? YES. Does it make me want to play it again and again? NO. The sound quality is great. BUT....extended bombastic guitar solos just dont do it for me. This kind of music was an extension of Iron Butterfly's INNA GADDA DAVIDDA and set the stage for numerous extended solo early 70's jam bands. Listen , enjoy it but I doubt if you will play it over and over"
3,Music's alright---DVD not worth it,"I bought the DVD version expecting live footage of the concert and was let down when I saw nothing more than the same pictures cycling over again while the same songs that are on the CD played. There was no video, only the same pictures playing. I would have saved 10 bucks and just bought the CD. The music is fine though. I too wish Young would release more of his live music. To sum up---don't buy the DVD version."
4,The DVD is high rez audio - not a concert video,"The point of the DVD in this package is that it is high resolution audio but, unfortunately, not DVD-Audio (thus it won't play in the DVD-Audio player in my car). To be annoyed that no ""video"" is included is a demonstration of the ignorance of high-resolution audio that is frequently displayed by the mp3 generation."
3,"it's been said already, but I'll concur here","Sadly, this CD is NOT CHEAP and does not give the whole performance.I can only assume because there's money to be made in breaking it up!What a nice release this would have been had they given the entire set - the acoustic half with the electric half.of course, what is there is wonderful blistering Neil Young and Crazy Horse.what isn't there is value for the dollar. And they have the audacity to include liner notes explaining to you the fact that you're only getting part of the show, as it describes how he chides the audience for cheering when he doesn't even know what song he's going to play.I'd have liked to have heard that."
2,I thought Neil wasnt singing for Miller,"As he said in his previous blues CD.This is CD captures a live performance. The sound is dated, sure, but the real Neil Young vibrancy comes through; Cowgirl in the Sand is a keeper. The rest of the songs, well, it is what it is.My complaint - the DVD that comes with it. Are we supposed to believe that a bunch of black and white photos with a movie reel playing in the foreground is really a live performance video?"
4,"Classic Neil, but for fans only","I've been waiting for this release since the mid-1970's when Neil collected some of his best work and archives into the 3-LP ""Decade."" To say I'm a bit disappointed in the length of this CD is an understatement. Instead of a proper archives release, Young and archivist Joel Bernstein have selected 6 tracks from the electric set with backing band Crazy Horse.""Live at the Fillmore East"" does feature some excellent audio quality and passionate performances frozen in time, but for me, this is just the first of several CD's for Neil Young fans only. I hope the next release is more substantial than the hors d'oeuvres presented here."
3,Bottom line: DVD is a ripoff,"C'mon, get real for a minute. How many of you bought the DVD for the better sound quality? Now, how many of you bought the DVD version simply thinking that it had concert footage (and I don't mean ""still"" pictures)?"
3,"Great Perfomance, good package, incomplete","The musical interplay between Young and Danny Whitten is awesome. As someone else noted, ""Cinammon Girl"" was part of this set and has been omitted. Also, the entire acoustic set is gone. The vocals are shaky in places, but that was Neil.I'm glad to see the archives being cracked open, but let's open it wide and do the thing right.Still, I recommend buying this one."
5,I can't wait for more!,"I totally agree with the reviews that say this is a unique cd both in terms of the sound quality but more importantly the virtuosity Crazy Horse displayed that night at the Fillmore. For those who get the DVD, I say the pictures add to the music wonderfully. There is no video from that night and maybe it is for the best because the music always is in the foreground while the pictures provide a nice background. The music is incredible in spite of the fact that the songs are so familiar; the performance still comes through as a thoroughly unique experience special to the occasion. Even if you have heard these songs a million times, you can not miss just how on this band was this special night. It is a joy to listen to. I can't wait for Massey Hall. Bring it on! One after another."
3,Tease,"After hearing about the Neil Young ""archives"" since the late 1970s and waiting patiently ever since, this is what we get for the first release??? Sheesh. It's only 43 minutes long! Essentially 1/2 a disc. Sure the sound is high quality, and the performance is great, but these shows opened with a solo acoustic set. Where are any of those songs? Why no renditions of ""The Loner"" or ""Cinnamon Girl,"" both of which were played in the electric set during this run? Maybe there are valid reasons for this, such as old tape problems, but there are no liner notes explaining anything about how this was put together. If -- as I fervently hope -- the next ""Archive"" release is from the 75 Rolling Zuma tour, PLEASE make it a 2-disc, full concert set.By the way, the music's excellent, there just isn't nearly enough of it."
4,The Louder The Better,"Do you remember how John Fogerty would take the CCR mixes out to his car and play them loud to see how they would sound? Well you have to do that with this cd. If you play it loud enough you'll see God. Yeah there's great guitar - but the bass is what propels it. Talbot's bass playing is in top form and transforms the music. If the CD isn't long enough just play it again! Smell the Horse, Feel the Horse, Ride the Horse! R.I.P. Danny Whitten."
2,Lower the price or finish the show!,"I don't care how many times I've blasted ""Everyone Knows This is Nowhere"" and ""Down By The River"" from this CD and thoroughly enjoyed them or how it's such a great look into a critical period of so many critical periods of such an amazing aritist...it's either over priced or more profoundly too lacking in sheer length. As a Neil fan I had to get it but it's hard not to feel slightly ripped off. Makes me skeptical about buying further such releases."
1,Never downloaded,The game required registration. The website to register the game is no longer active. It was a complete waste of money.

2,"tr'es franc,ais","A reclusive woman keeps a man who drifts ashore under the idea that they are on an unknown island. This is potentially deep. It touches upon ideas that woman needs man, or vice versa, heterosexually speaking. It hints that even misanthropes need companionship sometimes. Still, the movie also felt like ""Misery"" repeated. I hated watching James Spader's character be duped. This movie was long and had few sounds and dialogue. It seemed artsy and noir, in the French kind of way. This is an arthouse film, certainly not meant for the masses. I actually missed out on some of the dialogue because the lead actress' accent was so thick. This DVD really needed captions. This could be a deep meditation on the human condition, but it's still a bit of a yawner."
4,A Year in Provence,"""Markets of Provence"" is a delightful coffee table book/cookbook exploring France's southern Provencale region. It gives travelers tips for finding the seasonal markets,as well as the right ingredients. There is an emphasis on fresh fruits and vegetables that are in season. The dishes tend to be earthy,peasant food. There's ratatouille,the signature dish of Provence,along with piperade,the egg/vegetable omelette that's actually from the Basques. It's a joyous exploration of food and culture. Bon appetit!"
1,Poor service -- very poor follow-up.,"As part of a $250.00 order, I ordered the Michelin France Provence map in English, and the Michelin 2006 Red Guide France: Hotels and Restaurants in English - both Items they sent me were written in French, which are of no value to me. I requested a shipping label to return the map and the book and asked they send me the English versions. The Amazon Outsourcing Desk in India refused both request. I requested an American Amazon Customer Service Manager contact me on this Issue. That has never happened. I am also being asked my Satisfaction on a 3d book - Markets Of Provence - which they never sent me. The remainder of my $250.00 order were the English Versions, as ordered. My Overall Satisfaction: Well below the 1 Star shown. Actual Satisfaction ""F Minus"" for all departments in Amazon and far less for their very poor Customer Service and lack of ethical follow-up for their mistake."
3,"No vocal parts for ""A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow.""","Alas, in ""A kiss at the End of the Rainbow,"" only the main melody line is given, not the harmonies. Rats. And I bought the blessed book FOR those harmonies."
4,And?,"Just because Plummet made the song more upbeat makes it degrading? Trance mainly revolves around the issue of love; this song is perfect for this kind of genre. The point of music is to deliever satisfaction and sometimes a message. Even if this goes against the sad atmosphere of the original, its another method of spreading word of abuse. So all you folks RELAX and quit being so biased and ignorant of the possibilities."
1,I returned it. It was not 6th grade reading level.,"I thought it would be good for my 6th gread class,but a 5th grader said it more appropriate for younger students. I wish that the description would have told you what grade reading level it was targeting."
3,A little trite,"Sabrina's expectations and disappointments are a little trite. Her father is a flat image of an uncaring, bitter man, and the result is a little too one-dimensional. Ian is a thoroughly enjoyable character that exudes strength, humility, humor, and chagrin. I enjoyed this book, but found some of the characters rather premature."
3,Hero shines,This is my first book by this author. I did enjoy the story plot and it was a quick read. I felt the story and relationship between the hero and heroine could have been a little more entwine - less fighting and hurting. I felt the heroine was too stubborn and hurt the hero too much. It took too long for their love to blossom. I did enjoy the ending though and the passion the hero showed the heroine. I also like the romance and sex scenes. I would have love to read less violence and anger especially from the heroine. Ms. James did a good job in writing this book - lots of description and details. I would recommend it to others. I gave it 3 1/2 stars because it could have been soo much better.
3,Sweet story BUT,It's a sweet love story but the villain part was too underdeveloped and the story seemed a bit rushed at the end where it's simply all explained...
3,Promisses,I like Samantha James. I think she has a lot of talent. She has potential but she just doesn't live up to it. This was a good story don't get me wrong but it could have been better. Something is missing here. It just doesn't get four stars from me. I think her plots are too formulaic. Too much purple prose. Too much drama where there need not be. But really the purple prose is annoying. Too many stupid names for men and womens you know whats ;-) Also the characters could have been a little smarter. But I still recomend it. It had it's moments.
5,Samantha James rocks!,I read a Promise Given in less that one night. I didn't stop until I put it down!! It was wonderful and I loved the chemistry between Sabrina and Ian! How could she have ever thought that she was in love with another man!! I would definitley reccommend this book for anyone who was looking for a good read.
3,Mildley disappointed.....,"This was my first novel by Ms. James and I wasent totally disappointed. The plot was an interesting concept albeit a triffle predictable. There was pleanty of sexual descriptions. The only problem I had with this book it that the ending was a little weak. I would have preferred that Ms. James built more to the climax. I found the book at times a little slow moving and some of the characters, which were elemental in the plot, a tad underdeveloped. Otherwise I did enjoy the book for light reading."
3,"Good story, writing a little lacking...","This was one of the first Scottish romances I bought a couple years back after getting back into reading historical romances...and I have to agree with other reviewers that James' plot and characters are good, but the writing style occasionally veers into the realm of purple prose. Some elements of the prose just got to me...like using the word ""Nay"" to begin a sentence or a sentiment. Also the ending seemed rushed and some of the lines exchanged between characters during the climax featuring Margaret , Ian and Sabrina just seemed ripped out of a bad TV show. This is a good example of a novel that could have done with a strong-handed editor. I like James' plot ideas, however, and her character development. I will try some of her other books to see if the writing is more satisfactory. Read this book for plot and for some good -- if not great-- love scenes."
2,Just did not deliver,"The book had a good premise, but the writer was unable to execute it effectively. Good hero, good heroine, good story line, good location all equal just an o.k. book. I was very disappointed."
4,A sappy tale,"I would not go so far as to say that this story is original or that I was enchanted with the characters. However, it is an emptional light read that does very well as a romance novel. The mystery and betrayals add Gothic flair. In short, I enjoyed it."
4,Samantha James promises to be one of the best to read!!,"Samantha does it again!!! She has become one of my favorites.Ian and Sabrina were practically raised together while Ian was being tutored and trained under her father. Ian, a Highlander, was bethrothed to Margaret, a Lowlander and Sabrina's sister. Ian was a constant thorn in her side, as most big brothers and cousins are most times, except, neither Ian nor Sabrina realized that their constant bickering was really a sign of puppy love that soon blossomed into an enchanted love. But this only came about due to Margaret's mysterious disappearance the day before the wedding. Nevertheless, a ""Promise Given is a Promise Kept"" and Ian married the very reluctant Sabrina in Margaret's place. But ah, the plot thickens. Is Margeret truly dead and if so, who murdered her? Does Ian have enemies and spies abiding in his castle? Read the book to discover the answers to these questions and many more!!"
2,lawn cover,"I recieved the item quickly,but was not satisfied with the product,it felt very cheap,i honestly dont think it was the right product because it was like stuffed into the box."
3,"Does the job, mostly........","This item provides cover for about 95% of my self-propelled lawn mower. About 3 or 4 inches of the handlebar remains exposed if I leave it fully extended; and the rear wheels and lawn bag still shows but is mostly covered. When I fold down the handle, then the cover does its job fully. The mower deck and engine stays sheltered from the elements well, so I'm satisfied with my purchase."
3,Okay...,"This is an okay cover, though, it didn't fully cover my lawn mower as it appears on the box. I have a power-propelled Craftsman Briggs & Stratton mower with a grass catcher. I had to fold down the handle and remove the catcher it order for the cover to completely cover the mower. This appears to be made for smaller mowers."
3,Read to yourself before reading to your kids,"I thought this was a powerful book and enjoyed the writing a lot (especially the use of language). My reason for writing this review is to recommend to parents of kids under 10 that you read the book to yourself prior to reading out loud to your young kids. A couple times I was surprised to find myself reading a scene that I had to edit on the fly. Maybe I'm too protective, but I prefer to leave my kids with something before bed that dreams are made of, not something that could give them nightmares."
2,"Good Idea, Badly Expressed",This book had a very interesting plot; A left-handed boy with a very religous father who believe that the left-side is the side of the devil. As a result Luke has grown up using his right hand. This story isn't really about baseball but of family conflict and acceptance. The basic idea was good but was expressed in way that made it rather boring.
4,Choosing Up Sides,"The book I read was called Choosing Up Sides. I thought the book was very good. I really liked the book because I play softball and it was about a boy who was a really good pitcher, but his dad wouldn't let him play. There were a few things I didn't like about the book though. One thing I didn't like was the dad in the story. He had too many rules and he was mean to Luke. I also didn't think it was right to change Luke from bing a natural left hander to a right hander. The main thing I didn't like was the way his dad would beat his right hand if he used it. But other then that it was a great book."
5,Awesome Baseball Book!!,This is the best book I have ever read but now I'm going to get The Boy Who saved baseball too. I could not stop reading this. It has oldtime baseball in it but also a story that keep you on the edge of your seat late at night. I don't read many books I'd say about 4 or 5 a year and I read this one in two days!! Because it has so much information in it i never knew before. Read it. You wont be dissappointed! 5 stars!!
4,A Good Book,"I liked this book. One of the many plusses is the reality of the conflicts faced by the main character. However, I found it to be rather predictable."
4,Baseball lovers got to see,"This book is a great choice for baseball lovers. It's about a boy that wants to play baseball but sports are forbidden in his religion. He lives in a town where everybody is crazy about baseball. His father is a preacher and has many horrible rules.One example of a rule is that the boy is a natural lefy but must use his right hand for everything! According to his father the left hnd is the hand of the devil. ""Choosing Up Sides"" is a great book!"
5,The Fathers in CHOOSING UP SIDES and OVER THE WALL,"I have noticed the way the fathers in both of Mr. Ritter's novels, CHOOSING UP SIDES and OVER THE WALL seem to keep their families on their toes in some way or another. In CHOOSING UP SIDES, the father dominated the family by enforcing strict rules with old- fashioned punishments. Luke had to be very careful around him, so he was never quite comfortable. In OVER THE WALL, Tyler felt like his dad was making him ""an outsider in his own home."" He and his mother had to ""talk easy,"" and ""not do anything that might upset Dad."" In fact, in both stories, Luke and Tyler seemed to have to hold in their true thoughts and feelings so as not to upset their fathers. Because the cause of this discomfort was different in CHOOSING UP SIDES, the resolution in OVER THE WALL will most likely also be different.Both of these novels are causing me to think and talk about issues with my friends. I will be looking for more books by John H. Ritter."
2,tips and tricks,"This book consists of a few quick tips and tricks for speeding up your response time, and possibly eliminating a few choices on the GRE. Other than that, it contains a couple of practice tests, with explanations for all of the answers. It is broken up into weekly sections, which you are supposed to finish one lesson per day for 30 days. The first 8 days contains tips for each section, which I read all of in one day. The next 2 weeks consist of one complete practice test, broken up into one section one day, with an explanation following the next day, and so on. The next week is another practice test, broken up the same way. I was a little disappointed in the book, as I thought it would be more than just a few practice questions broken up into daily sections. This book will not build your vocabulary, or give you a math review, it just gives you hints on how to guess better and do it faster."
4,helmet,"This is a bit big for my 7 uear old--will save for the next couple of years,it is too hard for him to see out of. It is of good quality."
4,A Nostalgic Recollection,"A writer at the end of his prime visits Alexandria for a restful break. As he sits in an easy chair in a pension run by hisold friend, he sees two worlds juxtaposed: in the first he recalls his own past, his heady days of idealism and politicalactivisim; in the second he examines his life against those of the other, younger, guests at the pension. He tries toreconcile his own views and visions and dreams with those that he sees around him. Touched with a despairing senseof terminal nostaligia, he manages to re-examine his own life in its entire context -- and still be able to smile."
4,travelogue on science and cosmology more than hard descripitions,"The author states that her concept for the book is a series of essays written to her mom, mostly about her work and the science. It is an interesting collection of essays that sums up the essence of cosmological topology (what shape is the universe, what shape did it have in earlier stages) for a layman audience. It lacks the complex mathematics behind the ideas and the proofs and spends a fair bit of time with her own tribulations in a shakey marriage and the processes of academic science, so if you want just the meat this isn't your book. I found it entertaining, interesting and an easy read."
1,Disappointed,"After having a great Citizen watch for 15 yrs, I found myself having to replace. I looked and looked for a very similar watch and I thought I found it with this one. I was SO disappointed as soon as I opened the box. The pearl face is not very pearl looking, more white than anything. The weight of the watch is very lite and cheap feeling. The band is scratchy and cheap looking.Overall, not a good purchase."
3,Not as expected,"I was replacing a watch that was exactly like the photo, however when it arrived, I too feel that the photo is of a different version of this watch. The metal is much shinier and the face is yellower. Also, the dial is larger and not as nice looking. I've looked for this watch on the Citizen website, but can not find it. I have already taken the watch to have 4 links removed to fit my wrist (it's still a little big) so I will be keeping it even though it's not the same."
2,Watch has a very cheap feel to it.,"Its a citizen watch so I am not questioning the quality and the price is good too. However, I wanted to gift it to my wife and as much elegant as the watch looks in the picture it feels really light. The watch has no weight to it. That might be a good thing for some but to me it just didnt do. I returned the watch."
5,Great Stories of the Great Lakes is great!,"This is just the type of book that one who thinks of dark storms and waves of fury on the Great Lakes would like to read. This book is chock full of stories of shipwrecks and items of less seriousness. Dwight Boyer's books are truly one of the greatest achievements when it comes to the publication of great lakes lore, and this book is no exception. Enjoy the book!"
2,Not worth the money... A live recording with no libretto,"I recently purchased this version of Don Giovanni from Barnes and was very disappointed by it. It did not say anything about it being a live recording on the B&N or Amazon page, and also did not mention the fact that it does not include a libretto (for first-time opera listeners, a libretto is a booklet that contains the opera in two to four different languages, included in most operas on CD). I would not mind the fact that it is live if I were looking for a live performance. Amazon should include more information on what they are selling. I do not reccomend it to anyone unless they can stand the clunk of footfalls on stage in the recording, and also if they already have a libretto for the opera."
3,No libretto?,"I would have given this live recording 5 stars had it included a libretto or even a synopsis. It doesn't even have a track listing for the third CD, only the first and second. For this price, I expect much more than this package delivers."
1,totally annoying and terrible!,"Crazy Frog Album?!? - As if the mega annoying single Axel F Maxi is not enough. This is not music, just stupid handy tone trash things, enough do drive one nuts,from such irritiating acoustic trash which is on this CD. Anyone liking this CD can't be helped - Just terrible. This utterly annoying to the stratosphere CD is total junk, and just should be left on the shelf,and never touched again, so its so quickly forgotten, as it came."
1,stupid,"omg this cd is the dumbes thing ever it ruined the orginal axel f that i actually kind of likd and then killd it even mor with the stupid sgining frog goin ""dengdengdeng"" in some stupid gargly voice. i recomend not buying this cd i have 5219 songs on itunes and can safely say i wil nevr have crazy frog on itunes because its such a stupid cd,"
5,awesom!!!,This is the best music I have ever heard in my life.CRAZY FROG IS NOT ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,........eh........,"If this one goes off while your speeding, get redy for a ticket. It works, in that it goes off when there is a radar source close, it sucks in that It HAS TO BE CLOSE!!! I guess what I mean is you get what you pay for, I suggest to spend a little more and get a quality detector!!"
1,Be careful ordering this,"As you can see, this is supposed to be a 5"" vent. That size is needed by many portable air conditioners. Unfortunately, although the shipping invoice will also say it is 5"", what arrives is a 4"" vent. In fact, if you go to that product page, under Product Dimensions it says: 4.5 x 4.5 x 4 inches. It will not fit a 5"" duct.Addendum: the seller was very nice and incredibly fast about refunding my cost, including shipping. But I can't help noticing that the size miss-labling hasn't been fixed yet."
1,More trouble than it's worth,This transmitter is suppose to signal the matching alarm clock when the baby crys. The trouble is that the unit requires a continuous cry for 8 seconds before it signals the base unit and theres no adjustment to shorten the time. Our baby crys in short bursts and it doesn't work for her. At least if the baby sleeps in the same room as the mother the AM-6000 alarm clock has an internal Mic that works muck better than the remote. Baby and Mother will have to share a room till I find something that works.
4,Appeared well made and durable,The test of time in Northern New England stored in the sun and against the elements will be the true test.
4,just fine,the product came in a timely manner and except for the excess postage we had to pay we were pleased. Good quality and good fit for our riding Sear's mower.
1,Would have been a great magazine article,"This book is simply not good. There is little academic rigor on display, plenty of emotional invective, and a thinly veiled contempt for the Asian male, some of which could be forgiven, if it wasn't so exasperatingly repetitive, cloying and one-dimensional. I just spent several minutes looking for one of my favorite lines, whereby the author suggests that some wildly gratuitous assertion be ""taken as axiomatic"". Sadly, I couldn't find it, but I am sure you'd have shared my bewilderment. Want axiom? The author's understanding of ""Asia"", or at least that which is found in the pages of this book, is as pedestrian and imbalanced as any on display. The problems with the book don't diminish the importance of the topic, but don't expect to be enlightened within its pages."
3,Negrette gone bad.,"First about the DVD quality, it is not very good. The audio is awful. Most of these old Mexican movies are restored much better when they are released on DVD. This is the first movie by one of my favorite Mexican stars that has him more villainous than heroic. I wish that they would have redone the audio better because Jorge Negrette was one of the best voices in Mexican music. I still recommend buying it. I watched this movie in an open air theater in Mexico, years ago, where everyone brings a picnic lunch, sodas and beer. Great fun. They all sing along, too."
5,King of the Cowboys satisfies...,"This was as advertised. Another reviewer claimed this was Mr Rogers' biography, but it was the movie I expected. The movie did have a brief biography and filmography for Mr Rogers, Mr Burdette and Trigger. I believe it also contained a trailer for the film.Good movie and I was wondering where to find the biography the previous reviewer claimed to have instead of this movie."
2,Disappointing,"Not nearly as gripping as ""Upon the Head of the Goat"". Piri is not particularly mature nor intelligent. She has little interest in principles or independence, and is very indecisive. There are Jewish survival stories with heroines who you come to love (eg. ""Alicia: My Story""), but this isn't one of them."
1,Terrible,"Terrible! I had to read this book for school and it was boring. I don't know why but it is a terrible book. Save your money for something better and worth reading. It is just too slow and to long. And most of the kids in my class agree that there is a lot of (or too much) romance. Not enough action. Like I said before, don't waste your money!"
2,"GREAT BOOK, BAD ENDING, OR SHOULD I SAY NO ENDING.","HAVING AVOIDING STORYS ON THE HOLOCAUST AFTER SEEING THE NUREMBURG TRIALS AS A YOUNG CHILD, AND BEING TREMDOUSLY DISTURBED BY IT, I READ IT FIRST, AS MY 12 YEAR OLD SON WAS ASSIGNED TO READ THIS BOOK. IT WAS A GREAT TRUE STORY, SAD BUT HAPPY, ONLY AFTER FOLLOWING HER, PIRI DAVIDSON, FOR 3 YEARS, I NEVER FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER ONCE SHE ARRIVED IN AMERICA."
2,Booooring,Quit after 'Upon the Head'. You will retain a much higher opinion of Siegal if you pass on this prosaic and inconsequential sequel.
4,"Quality product, built strong.","I bought this for a Bolens 38"" cut rider. The unit is designed for multiple applications (about a half dozen tractors) and was kind of a Pain-in-the butt to put together. It took help from a friend to install the tines. It even bent 2 screwdrivers in the process. The metal they use is pretty heavy. The nice thing about the product is that it is front mounted. So you can bag as to go. It got up so much thatch that I had a 4'x10'x10' foot pile from approximately ? acre lot!"
5,this guy is hilarious,"Omid is hilarious in stand-up, very good in movie bit parts, but this is excellent though feels too short by the time it is done. If you're a real cheap skate, then you can find most of the material here and there on you tubes. This dvd is put together well, looks good and is funny even if you've seen the on-line material."
3,"Funny, but hard to follow...","While I enjoy watching Omid Djalili and find his routines very funny at times, as this performance was taped in the UK, there are many references to British politics, etc., that I completely missed. Definite buy for someone who has lived in Britain, but perhaps not for someone who can't follow the nuances of the performance."
3,"Definitely a ""water hog""! Never dries!!",I purchased this matt for our back door so that when my son comes in the house wet from playing with the water hose the mat would soak up some of the water.It does indeed soak up water like crazy. However it never seems to dry. This may be because our back door is always in the shade. Never the less I have to pick the matt up after a rain and lay it out in the sun to dry.
3,GREAT BUY,"NOT THE BEST SUBWOOFER OUT THERE, BUT WHO CAN ARGUE WITH THE PRICE!!! IT SOUNDS VERY GOOD TO ME FOR THE MONEY PAID."
2,Magnetic case but not the bit holder,This offers a lot of bits but if you are thinking the bit holder is magneticto hold the screws you would be wrong. What a ridiculous design! At $30 it is also overpriced. I paid $13 and I still feel ripped off.
5,Discontinued Item that I NEED....reasonable price,"I used to love this product but then they took it off the shelf. Thank you for offering it. If you order only 1, the shipping is pretty bad, but 3...thats a bargain. Hope there are more left in your stock, want to order again soon!"
4,Devastating,"A rather surreal tale from Wambaugh,s pen about two policeman, one of whom is disturbed and tortured because he let his partner ( Ted Danson) be murdered by a sadistic James Woods. ( so he thinks).John Savage plays the tortured officer who cant live with the sight of the execution of his partner and the reality of the impotence of the criminal justice system that still pulls him apart years after the incident.The film plays almost like a documentary and Woods is truly chilling. Matching him and going beyond is Franklin Seales a bizzare interloper into Woods, family. He is truly even more disturbing than Woods if thats possible.Whats being said in this film is very depressing and it jumps out at you !"
1,About As Interesting As Watching Onions Grow,"For some reason, whenever Hollywood tries to make a movie out of a Joseph Wambaugh novel, the film tends to fall flat. And ""The Onion Field"" is a good example of how a good book can be turned into a bad film.""The Onion Field"" has all the makings of a good film: A good cast, high drama and a true-life story with a poignant message. However, this film does not make full use of these characteristics and the end result is a movie that never realizes its potential. If anything, ""The Onion Field"" is a long, boring film that leaves you feeling empty and drained."
1,Malevolence personified,"I have never seen a film before that made me consider offing myself but The Onion Field almost succeeded. What a miserable work of art. Shows you clearly why life is not worth living for. Not a redeemable character in the film and actually very little character development at all. If someone buys this for you, please recycle it immediately."
3,Good overview book on maples,"I am not sure what I was expecting when I ordered this book but I have mixed feelings about the book. For one, I think the book provides a good overview of Japanese maples. The book covers most of the major cultivars but only in small details. There are plenty of photographs; most show the leaves, which is good if you want to get an idea on what color the tree will have. There are some photographs of the whole trees, which you wish there were more because of just how beautiful they look.Overall, the book provides a good overview and makes a good coffee table book. The cost is high and the book itself, unfortunately, has a plain cover. You will need to keep the book's paper jacket in good shape if you plan to use it as a coffee table book.If you want a book that covers a lot of details on a specific type of tree, this is not the book; however, If you want to look at a lot of maple tree types before deciding on one, I found this book helpful for that."
3,not as pictured,"The banana plugs are sheathed, so as shipped the leads will not fit older multimeters. However, it a soft plastic sheathing that can be easily removed with a utility knife, just be careful of your fingers."
1,First published in 1883,"Bishop Knecht was a German bishop in the late 19th century. This book was first translated to English in 1894. This is the 2003 reprint. While it can be beautiful in parts, it does not include any of the amazing and corrective insights of the last hundred and fifty years of scriptural scholarship. This is not an appropriate book for bible studies or personal growth. It is a glimpse into the past. Shame on the publishers to pass it off as a contemporary commentary."
1,A Practical Guide to Holy Scripture,I was disappointed because this is not practical or useful at all - I feel the book was misrepresented. I cannot imagine who might use this anthology short of someone doing research on how scripture was interpreted in the 16th century. Much scholarhip has been done since then and this does not reflect a useful or modern view of scripture.
4,practical commentary on holy scripture,this is a really complete and well written book just wish it had bulk price have 5 people interested but cost too much right now
4,A Great Diane Duane Book,"The Door Into Sunset is a great book. It's very liberal (that may cause problems for uptight people) and the plot is unlike any I've ever read. Herewiss and Freelorn and Segnbora and Sunspark, they all became like family members that I particularly liked to me. I won't tell you what happens in the story (that would ruin it), but I recomend it to the liberal people out there."
5,One of the best books in the world,"Just fantastic. I couldn't think of anything better. A fantastically drawn world, with magical laws as real as our laws of physics. The characters are so real they take your breath away, and Duane just makes you rethink everything you once held true about life. Absolutely amazing. I can't wait for the next one."
5,This is a great book!,This is a wonderful book! I would highly recommend it. Rev. Billy Graham has kept America strong by converting people to Christianity. Who knows where America would be as a nation if Rev. Billy Graham did not exist. It is God's providence and blessing that He has sent him to America. We hope that God will not lift His blessing from America and I agree with Rev. Billy Graham that America needs to be right with Jesus Christ.
5,A Wonderful Handbook,"Billy Graham is ever the true believer but never an ideologue. He understands sin, Satan, and our Savior. His ability to interpret the Bible to form the rationale for good living is nothing short of miraculous. He points to his own trials, failures, and triumphs as well as those of others. Whatever is wrong with America now, we need to look at what was right to produce Billy Graham. He often references his mother and her knowledge of the Bible. Therein must lay a principal source of his knowledge, strength, and faith. Yet like John Paul, his is never rigid about the value of families in themselves. God has his plan for all of us, Graham reiterates. We need only start from here and go forward."
5,The Journey by Billy Graham,"This book was very inspiring,as I would expect, from Billy Graham. Would most definitely recommend this book."
2,Not pleased,I have ordered books from Amazon on several occasions.My complaint is that I am never quite sure of the shipping costs and resulting charges to my credit card. This is a real problem for me - to the point where I am reluctant to place additional orders.
5,uncook your way to health,"great book! the bakers do a great job sorting a lot of information into this small book. they offer scientific studies, a personal recovery story, and lots of great recipies. all the recipies i have tried have been good but some are a food combining charts nightmare. some ingredients are harder to come by but most can be improvised with what you have on hand. anyone interested in raw foods should have this book on their recipie shelf."
3,Not much works with 80/10/10,If you eat a gourmet raw food diet than this is an ok book. It has nut loafs and cheeses and other real high fat stuff that has the same detriment to your health as eating the typical cooked food American diet. All just written recipes nothing fancy like photos and stuff.
1,"Good Movie, Bad Transfer to DVD","This movie, when I first saw it, was an engaging and enjoyable romp, with good acting, music, and script. Everybody in it was clearly having fun, and Lisa Raines (Foster) was charming and delightful, perfect for the role. I've been a fan of this film ever since.However, THIS transfer, despite the good picture quality and sound, wasn't worth getting. There are a number of pieces of the film missing, including a critical-to-the-story bit of narrative by Fanny near the end, which is on my VHS copy. Even if you haven't seen it before, you can tell the pieces are missing. There are abrupt ""chops"" in some sequences, or the music ends abruptly and the scene jumps.This picture deserved MUCH better treatment."
1,Lost treasure,This once great movie has been butchered beyond being able to give it the stars it should have. Any seller on this site attempting to take money for this hacked up version should be required to post a warning!!!Apparently this cut up version is the only one available in America.Why would some idiot mutilate a movie as this on was done?Hopefully one day the uncut version will get released.......
3,edited version less than others but still edited,"yes the movie came on time,but unfortunately it is an edited version which wasn't advertised before hand.i know there are other versions that are more edited.anyhow for the amount of money it cost i was hoping to get an unedited version-thanks for listening"
4,"Para los que nos gusta Fanny Hill, éste es el dvd a comprar !!!","A ésta versión le pongo 4 estrellas porque no viene widescreen, pero por lo demás está bien. Viene completa (sin cortes o ediciones) y, aunque los colores no fueron mejorados, no importa, pues los que hemos buscado ésta peli sabemos que las otras versiones de dvd son fatales."
1,No program in the box !,"I don't know how this product performs, because no CD program was even in the box, not even a booklet of instructions. How can you be sent any empty box?"
5,The best book in the series,I had read Weetzie Bat and the Goat Guys. It had seemed like a nice book so I decided to read the rest of the series. I was upset though when I discovered that the second book in the series was about Witch Baby. She just didn't seem to be one of the nicer characters in Weetzie Bat. But I decided I should at least try to read through this one before going on to the next book in the series. Boy was I surprised when Witch Baby turned out to be on of my favorite characters of all time and this turned out to be one of my favorite books of all time! This may have been the only book I ever read which made me cry almost every single moment I was reading. I was able to relate to Witch Baby just a little too well.
5,Witch Baby is a magicly written book.,"Witch Baby, along with Block's other books are written in a ""real fairy tale"" style I think both young people and adults would enjoy. She has a way of turning an everyday event into a fantastic journey and likewise she makes you belive that Witch Baby has really encountered theses wonderous events. Witch Baby is a must read for anyone who has (or is) looking for where they belong. So put on your cow boy boot rollerskates and bat shaped back pack and join Witch Baby in her search..You just might find something you've been looking for."
3,"Engaging series, although not Paxson's best","Lady of Light and Lady of Darkness introduce interesting characters in a fabulous setting (apparently Earth after an apocalypse) but the endings are unsatisfying, especially in the second book. The hero and heroine, Faris and Jehan, vacillate between strength and weakness and become rather blase in Lady of Darkness. Still, the series is entertaining and worth reading. Perhaps more appropriate for teens than adults."
3,I love the dogs but what's Holly's deal?,"I have read every one of Susan Conant's books in the last two weeks, so maybe that's why I am so disappointed with her latest effort. Rowdy and Kimi are as intelligent and beautiful as ever but what happened to Holly? I understand that she's had head trauma but what's with the bitterance she seems to be displaying? I miss her old dog absorbed happy self. I also miss the old Steve. That whole Steve storyline just isn't believable, it's too farfetched for his in control character. I found myself wanting to reread her first book so I could remember the good times."
2,Too much repetition,I grew weary of characters having basically the same conversations over and over to make a point. I would have liked a tighter story with more punch. Ending not satisfying either...no justice for the perp.
3,Not as good as the old days!,"While I still enjoy reading the latest story from Susan Connant, I find her most recent work lacks the skillful and entertaining writing of her earlier efforts.From the beginning of this book I found the entire set-up unbelievable: why anyone with amnesia would continue on with their life as if nothing had happened all the while having a deep fear of personal injury is beyond me. As the story unveiled itself the impossibility of it all continued to taint the storyline for me. This was not, in my opinion, one of her better books. If you find that you must read it, I suggest waiting for the paperback version to reduce your losses."
1,A real dog of a dog book,"Holly may have gotten the case of amnesia, but I wish I could forget this book. I rarely give up on a book, but I couldn't make myself finish this one. Evil Breeding and Creature Discomforts is a killer combo for my appreciation of Susan Conant's abilities."
4,Not to be forgotten,"I thought this was one of Conant's best--getting the dogs away from the home town and into situations where they could still show their amazing qualities, but not be focused on ""show dogs"" was excellent. She handled the amnesia very well--as she ""learned"" about who she was, her recall of her personality was quite humorous. The characters were strong, especially Holly's father. I enjoyed this story throughout, right up until the end. My only complaint with this novel was the whole interaction/relationship with Steve. I thought the surprise at the end unnecessary; it was over the top. I'm not sure what it was supposed to add to the story unless it was just a way to prolong interest in the relationship/interaction and if that was the case, I'd say it was more strange than effective."
4,Time for a change,This was indeed a departure from her other books that I love. IT was most interesting and a new setting outside of Cambridge was a change of pace. I believe to have a character develop that there needs to be some occasional changes in the basic format of the series. This was a fine book but definitely not typical of the series. I am more of a cat person but have learned a great deal of information from her books concerning showing and the obedience aspect of dog showing. The new characters were interesting but admittedly I was most complacent and pleased with her familiar Cambridge setting and characters. Good job to the author and keep those Holly Winters stories coming.
3,"Russia and the Vatican, heads up.","Well I must say this was the first of my attempts to jump into the Vatican type Espionage. I wasn't dissappointed, but I wasn't sure what to expect. It slowed a bit for a section. But I like the prophecy correlation. I was raised Catholic so it was somewhat familiar. The ending honestly made it all worth while for me. I needed something and it at least satisfied. Would I say ""run out and get it now! "" probably not. Enjoy."
2,Barely functional,Banana plugs are OK but the grabbers are of poor quality. The Button easily misaligns with the body making it difficult to engage. The hook is much too flexible. I will cut off the grabbers and replace them with decent ones.
2,Not worth the low price,"This grabber set was barely functional. It took a good 5 - 10 minutes with a set of pliers to get the spring and hook to fit together properly so that it could even extend out to grip a wire. Much of that time was spent bending the 'hook' from the straight position that it arrived in. Its not that I minded spending a bit of time fixing the product, but considering that there are so many other options within $1 or $2 of the price of these, I would recommend buying one of those that doesn't require manual adjustments before use.Also, when the description says 'mini'grabber they mean MINI. These are probably most appropriate for 22+ gauge wire. I was expecting something more in the 12 gauge range."
1,Banana plugs pop out - unusable,"The banana plug ends of these leads have retractable plastic sheaths, which at first I thought was a nice touch. Unfortunately, they are spring-loaded, and the spring action is strong enough that it pushes the leads out of the banana plug! This happens on several instruments; it's not an oddball jack that is causing the problem. So, you're testing away and suddenly the lead pops out of the jack. Too clever by half."
2,Horrible,"Yes, they technically work - they do conduct electricity, after all. But the actual grabbers are horrible. I figured the other reviewers were just whiny - don't make the same mistake I did. They often catch and have to be rotated around to make them work, and the black one already doesn't extend all the way (interestingly, it did when it was ""new"" - not within three hours, though). They're chunky enough that I can just use a small alligator clip on anything I can get these onto. Never again."
5,The right tool for the right job,"I needed a couple of probes to provide synch to a pocket oscilloscope. These do the job, with no fuss."
4,Reasonably good test leads,"I needed replacement leads because someone stole my old ones that had alligator clips. I have seen these ""hook style"" leads used in several articles and videos, thought I'd give them a try. I'm generally pleased with them. At first, I thought the hook would only be useful on small wires and pins, but surprisingly they work pretty well on larger wires too. I also like the cables, they are flexible, and because they aren't coiled, they tend to stay where you put them. The only thing I don't care for is the spring loaded plunger, which tends to stick sometimes. For the money, these are reasonably good."
5,Great accessory,"If you have ever tried to hold a meter and use both hands to probe a circuit while working in a confined or awkward area, you will know how valuable it is to have a set of these probes for your multi-meter!"
5,Minigrabber is a must!,I have enjoyed the ease of use with the banana to minigrabber set. They are very high quality and really free up your hands to be able to do other things. I would highly recommend them.
2,The grabbers fray with time,"These cables gave me less than a year of mild use. The connection of the cable into the grabbers started coming loose and fraying, and in the end failed.The grabbers are mushy; I had to keep adjusting the hook on the grabbers with a pair of pliers to make them stay where I hooked them up.I'm looking for something better now, but it may be that I have to solder my own to get good quality cables -- cheap junk like this may have driven quality cables out of the market."
3,OK Product for the price,"I agree with most of the other reviews. They work but not very well. Still, for the price, they are OK if you don't use them very often."
3,"Not high quality, but adequate","The first thing I did was examine the ""grabber"" hooks. I was disappointed to see they were made from bent metal ribbon rather than rods used in high quality ""grabbers"". That alone is not a problem if the ribbon is made from very strong metal, but it isn't. A strength test showed that a modest pull on the hook will straighten it quickly.I had not noticed the length specified is only 3 feet. That is too short of you are connecting to any bench gear. I will be using them only with portable DMMs, so the length is not a serious problem for me."
5,Work Great,"I love these mini-grabber test leads. They work great and being able to clip them onto wires, a chassis, or just touch them to something for a continuity test... these work great."
5,Don't miss it anymore,"Once you read Pogue, you're hooked. Not only does this man know all there's to know about the Mac and its OSes, he is an OS himself--operating the snappiest, wittiest, funniest English I know. I run OS 8 on my office Mac and lowly 7 at home, but MM OS 9 is the book of 2000 for me. Don't miss it--even if you're a Wintel user."
4,"good, except one thing","I agree that is an informative book, and I also agree that it has the best photographs of any book on this subject. However, the photos are where I was a bit disappointed. I received the book in the mail and as soon as I saw the cover my heart sank. Having been in the military, the first thing that I noticed was the blank adapters on the weapons of the troops. Now, maybe I was deluding myself, but I was not prepaired for that. After going through the book, it seemed that all of the photos were of various stages of training in the special ops schools. Eventually, this bothered me less because, thinking realistically, how would they get photos of actuall missions and if they did, we would definitely never see them.Overall, I recommend this book. The content is decent and the picutres are brilliant, I just had to prepare readers as picky as I am."
4,It had Force Recon!,"First off, this book was a good portrayal of special operations units in America. Nearly all of the bases are covered. One thing to note, though is that I wouldn't have given it a 4 star rating if it didn't have stuff about Force Recon Marines, which are obviously the best of the lot (sorry SEALs, its true). I would have only given it a 3 star rating, because there isn't enough info about missions and traing, and especially weapons used."
3,Excellent photos but poorly informative,"The best photos ,you can find about American's elite soldiers, are in this book,since the author is a Pullitzer-winning photographer.But the written parts are poorly informative esspecially on technical aspects like equipment and weapons."
1,Disappointing t ext and photography.,"The photography was at best ""mediocre"" and presented nothing that could not be seen in other books on Thailand. The text lacked both depth and understanding of the subject and was stilted."
4,Fascinating Glimpse into the Plain World,I live in an area thick with Amish. This was a fascinating glimpse into their world for me. An engaging story as a young woman struggles with right and wrong.
3,"Light, easy reading...doesn't require lots of concentration.","I have just read the first two books in the series and enjoyed them very much. I am waiting to buy the last one and get started reading.This was light, easy reading and very informative. I recommend these books."
2,Interesting details but cardboard plot,"The author definitely knows Amish details. But in my opinion these were ""two-dimensional"" novels that could have been so much richer. Furthermore, the likelihood of those events coming together--the unlikely adoption, the true love not really drowning in the ocean but reappearing five years later, the main heroine becoming the mistress of a manor--made these more Christian-styled ""soap opera"" books than good, richly styled novels."
5,Great Read!,"Another wonderful book by Lewis. The movie is good, but I must say, the book is GREAT! The book is so much more detailed than the movie. I will be reading this book over again!"
2,"The Shunning was GREAT, the other 2 books, bad","I LOVED The Shunning. It was a great book with lots of suspense and surprises. I couldn't wait to get to the next book.....now I wish I never did. It was SO BORING and SO DRAWN OUT and had absolutely terrible characters, like Dylan, who took up the entire book. It seems like Ms. Lewis ran out of ideas and instead of writing a 2 book series, she made it a 3 book series....She should have kept it to 2. I was so bored I just kept paging through and trust me, you could get the gist of it without reading every page. Disappointing!! Read Abram's Daughters Series instead!!!"
5,Excellent Author and Great Reading,"I have read all the Beverly Lewis books and I love them all!Have shared them with multiple friends and they all agree.Just getting ready to read her current one ""The Covenant"".Highly recommend this Author and her books! Good Cleanenjoyment and hard to put down reading!"
3,starts out great but disappoints in the end,"The first part of this series, ""The Shunning"" was really a good story. The conflicts of faith and conscience were real and genuine. The details of Amish life were rich. As I read, I longed to know the rest of the story. However, the next two novels sink into being preachy without a real discussion of faith and theology. The author intimates that the Amish are not Christians without defending that theology. I did a little bit of research and the Amish and Mennoites come from the same Anabaptist roots. The author indicates that ""the people"" don't ""know Jesus"". She needs to do a better job defending her position if she is going to judge. In the second and third books the story is consumed by the ""conversion"" and the characters lose depth. What started out to be a great story falls flat in the end."
1,Heritage of Lancaster County -Pack,"An excellent series. I have read several of Beverly Lewis"" books on the Amish and found them fascinating. She is a wonderful writer. I even gave a Book Report to a Women's Group in our church and it was very well received. All the series will be eventually placed in our church Library for others to enjoy."
2,i would not recommend,These books had a great story line but the story drags on and on including to many trivial details. The only reason you even continue to read this trilogy is to see if Kaite ever gets back together with Dainel Fisher her childhood love. The book contains lot of useless info that makes it very annoying to read. You will end up spending atleast 2 days of your life (thats how long it took me to read the three books. Which is a long time for me b/c i usually go through 8-10 in that amount of time)reading these books to find that the only good part is the epiloge of the last book.
5,Herbal Education,"This course was wonderful, it taught me how to use the spices in my cupboard, as well as the herbs in my backyard to make simple remedies for my family. It comes in a box and contains 2 videos, 2 books, and an audio cassette. All the material was great! When you buy this course, there is a phone number inside. Call the number and register with the School. Then you can call anytime you have questions about herbs or your studies. I highly recomend this course to anyone."
4,Love it!,it was delivered just now- you can tell its cotton and well made just by looking and hugging it. i cant WAIT to use this in my restorative yoga practice! good price excellent delivery very happy with this product!
5,Nice,I got this for my wife and she loves it...uses it every day. It seems like a great product for a nice pice. We are ordering second one.
3,Hit and Miss - black and white,Probably just missed that this entire book is black and white reproductions. However - they are nicely done. The quality of the drawing seems a bit of hit and miss - making the lovely and precise drawings of Arantza and Marcelo Sosa really stand out.worth it for under 10$~!
3,Play The World Strategy Guide Review,"I thought this book was pretty good. A lot of it is review (for me) but I did learn some other strategies and tricks. The tricks weren't as useful as I thought, but besides that, the book provides good information for beginners and veterans."
4,aging but good game,A usefull guide for new players like me. Well worth the small price paid. These last six words are required and then some
2,Buy the game instead,"If you purchase the game and take your time, you can soon learn almost everything that is in this book. What is missed are special strategies and techniques, shortcuts, more than just the rote recitation of what you get with the game itself.I love CIV III despite the almost absurdly long times at the end. Especially fun are the huge games in which you are sometimes centuries meeting your nearest neighbor. The one thing I don't like about the game: It is nearly impossible to keep a city once it is captured as it almost always reverts back to its former status. Fix this bug!"
2,Buy the Game Instead,"missed are special strategies and techniques, shortcuts, more than just the rote recitation of what you get with the game itself.I love CIV III despite the almost absurdly long times at the end. Especially fun are the huge games in which you are sometimes centuries meeting your nearest neighbor. The most annoying facet is control of enemy territory. It is nearly impossible to keep a city once it is captured as it almost always reverts back to its former owners. Fix this bug!"
1,Fragile!,"The product works great until the first time you drop it. I've had 2 of these and they've both broken the same way; the housing gyro in the back end of the unit breaks off and rattles around, rendering the mouse cursor unusable. Both incidents were an 18-inch drop onto a wooden floor from the armrest of a sofa.If you don't have thick padded carpet in your TV room, stay away."
2,NOT a universal remote,"This remote is good enough as a media center remote. However, if you are planning on using it to control your TV, receiver and other functions you are in for a lot of frustration. Learning function simply doesn't work properly, and as someone already mentioned overrides don't work in PC mode."
3,Ethics book,I ordered this for a class I am registered for. It's not something I would have purchased otherwise. Hopefully it turns out to be interesting.
4,operations,"I got what I expected. The unit doesn't have continual play-least wise-I didn't see where you get it to do it. The directions aren't real good. When speed dubbing, it isn't real clear how to do it. It says to just push high speed dubbing. But you have to push pause--play-- and record at the same time. The unit does work quite well and sounds good. It has a good face and the buttons are clear. For the price, it's a good unit."
4,For the price a good buy,Works fine came with all necessary cables for the average user a great buy.very easy to use good sound and good looking.
4,Does just what I wanted it to do,"Easy to hook up to an existing stereo component system. Playback sounds good, have not had opportunity to record yet. Good enough for my needs. Only wanted to listen to the 100s of tapes I still have from years ago. Didn't really want to spend the time and $$ to transfer them to CD."
1,Not a good deal,"Ordered this deck as a gift. Never heard of Pyle before. Now I know why. This deck looks cheap with its tacky blue graphics. Right out of the box, the power switch didn't work. It has a one-year limited warranty, BUT you have to send it to the manufacturer at your expense, and send $20 for return shipping. Why would anyone spend $30+ on shipping for an item that arrived defective? It's going back to Amazon, and I'll buy a brand I recognize and trust."
3,Some What Pleased?,"I didn't expect much for the price I paid which after I got it I thought that to be a bit much. This a unit that I believe shouldn't be sold for more than 45-50 dollars at most. The buttons or old style cassette player type and they are flimsey to push, I don't expect them to last a very long period of time before one or more falls off or breaks off. I expected to have a counter on it that would operate on both deck A and B not just on B deck. So far the mechanics of it is holding up along with the electronics of it, has great sound quality and is easy to use, of which I guess is do to its simplicity. I use it to transfer tapes to CD, DVD and MINI DISC and get a good copy however I have yet to Dub a tape on it yet. Over all it's a good home use deck, but the price of $74.00 is a little high in my opinion. If you buy this unit I personally hope the best for you and hope you understand although it says ""PRO"" on it, it is anything but that. Good luck with your purchase!"
3,Pyle Tape Deck,"This deck works fine, but it is totally lacking in features one would expect in a dual machine. No relay play, no reverse play."
5,The Sith War Explored,"Finally, the ancient Sith War is explored in-depth. Words will not do this volume justice - it is worth your time. The illustrations are all very well done, and the plot is more than engrossing.If you've read the other entries in the Tales of the Jedi series, you'll be very happy with this one - and if you haven't, you'll be hunting them down."
4,great comic for insight,it's a great comic and insight into the world of star wars. though the drawing by todays standards is pretty poor but i found it to be quite entertaining.
4,The Sith War,"I found this volume of the Tales of the Jedi to be fairly good. The other volumes of this series were imaginative and did a good job of introducing this storyline and the broader history of the Star Wars universe. This book is more of a closing to that story line than anything else. There are many exciting points, such as a climactic battle with the leader of the Mandalorians, the turning of many Jedi to the dark side, and what seems like an unbearable judgment carried out on the traitorous protagonist of the series, Ulic Qel-Droma. Overall, The Sith War nicely closes many story lines from the previous books while at the same time not closing the door to the next book in the series, Redemption."
2,just terrible,"The artwork is wanting, the storyline appeared to be very thrown together and I did not get any real sense of why the Sith legends were so impressive. None of the characters in the graphic novel was particularly compelling nor were any of the battles (were the Mandalores necessary?)"
1,"so this is the highly destructive ""sith war""","problems:1) there is no ""sith"" and there is no ""war""2)the Republic wasnt close to being defeated.3)where's the danger , the deaths , anything about the overhyped sith war , our own world wars were 1000X more threatning than Exar Kun's plan , or whatever the hell he was doing."
4,Comments on Mountains of the Moon,"I enjoyed the film as it related to the Burton search for the Nile which has always been intriguing to me. There is a element of fiction so I am not sure just how much is fact and where poetic license takes over. The attack scenes are quick graphic but may not be far from the actual occurrence. The actors do an excellent job of portraying their subjects and yes, the Burton/Livingstone scene comparing battle wounds is amusing--whether it really occurred or not. Worth seeing for the cinematography alone."
5,phenomenal,"I have not seen this movie in over 10 years, but it does not leave me as being the best & most memorable movie I have ever seen. Really truly incredible, definitely inspired, and I disagree that it is slow...just to take in the incredible visual journey married with a semi-historic prolific story that is absolutely moving in every sense."
2,Wasn't worth the hype,"A great movie if you like to see grime and only grime. For me, it is a disjointed movie. The story wasn't melded enough. The characters did not connect with each other enough to create the drama. The sex scenes are so bad that they look like afterthoughts. Poor editing. I see why ordinary mortals like me would not go ga-ga over this."
2,"Good book, awful reading","Foote's a fine writer, a wonderful and accessible historian -- but he's no performer and he does his work a great disservice by narrating it on this audio version. His slower than molasses, monotone reading makes for an incredibly frustrating listening experience. You want to scream at him to just get on with it. I ended up giving up on the whole thing after only the second tape. A shame. I enjoyed reading Foote's history on the Civil War several years ago and was looking forward to reliving the experience in tape form. I suggest you get this in book form."
3,Vicksburg: The Cliff Notes,"This is the same type of feel-good no-footnotes-it-just-crowds-the-page pseudo-history for which fiction writer Shelby Foote is famed. Others have written three volume sets on the Vicksburg Campaign (Bearss), but Shelby Foote seems comfortable boiling it down into a novella. It makes for a nice quick read, but others wishing to get their hands dirty with some real history should opt for Bearss, Grabau (98 Days), Winschel, or Timothy B. Smith (Champion Hill)."
2,SIMPLIFY! CONDENSE!,"DR. SAMPSON TOOK TOO MUCH TIME OBSESSING OVER THE EXPONENTIALLY MULTIPLYING PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE WITH MCS ARE READILY AWARE OF. MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ADVICE ABOUT HEALING MCS, START AT THE ""TRANSFORMATION"" SECTION OF THE BOOK. IT WILL SAVE YOU MUCH TIME. DR. SAMPSON AND PATRICIA HUGHES HAVE, HOWEVER, DISCOVERED A VITAL PROCESS IN THE HEALING OF MCS. IT EMBODIES CHANGES IN THE WHOLE PERSON: PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL. THE BOOK WILL OPEN YOUR MIND AND YOUR HEART TO ALTERNATIVES YOU MAY NOT HAVE CONSIDERED"
3,Definitely Worthwhile Reading for All EI,"As a person recovering from EI, I can only applaud the efforts of Sampson & Hughes. While the ongoing sufferings were something that anyone with MCS is only too well aware of and something that I skipped through, the main theme offered in the book -- as pointing the path out of the living death of MCS -- is true. I had begun to find my way out, but the verification I felt from this book and the real resources they offered to facilitate healing I consider a gift from the Universe and one for which I am deeply grateful."
1,What a disappointment! Bizarre..,"Thinking that an MD with MCS that took the time to write a book about the experience and found a way out of his ""total allergy syndrome"", I anticipated a book of substance and practical advice. To my profound disappointment, Sampson and his wife spin a tale of the most bizarre, unbelievable stories that unfortunately for him, as well as for readers with MCS, deny the medical fundamentals of this frustrating and debilitating disease. I forced myself in disbelief through the first half of the book, cruised another couple of chapters, and had to call it a day."
1,Puuuhleeeeze!! Don't Waste Your TIME!,They don't even have a clue! This is a very old - outdated book. It needs to be out of print!
5,Best two player game for nes!,"This has to be one of the best if not THE best two play nes game out there. You and a friend play as a couple kung fu masters that can punch,flip,shoot fire,break blocks,find secret bonus stages,and fight bosses. The music is completely awesome too. Anyone with an nes needs to own this game."
5,Flash Cards on Steroids,"I've never seen a line of flash cards as well thought out, organized, and executed as the ones produced by Tuttle. Like the cards in the first series, the vocubulary was selected based on its frequency count in a selection of modern works. Each word is shown in Arabic script and English transliteration along with a non-trivial sample sentence (also in script, transliteration and translation). And four words derived from similar roots are also included on each card. Need I say more ?"
4,de manera sencilla se habla del amor familiar,es un mensaje claro y sencillo sobre la amistad y el amor familiar con importantes actores mexicanos de la epoca.
4,does it's job with a little help,"I needed this because my dryer blocks the door when it sticks out too much. This relocated my connection to the top. Unfortunately it doesn't stay in place very well, I also had to use some tape to keep it in place. Some tape also helps in keeping a seal between the two halves. Aside from that it does perfect."
3,DOES IT'S JOB,THIS DOES THE JOB OF VENTING BUT IS FLIMSY. THICKNESS CLOSE TO THAT OF AN ALUMINUM CAN. I GUESS THE PRICE OF RAW ALUMINUM MUST BE SKY HIGH.
5,Love It!,I Love this Product. Bugs Love me & I always need to have this product on hand. I tend to swell up & this product keeps me from itching.
1,radiance,The problem with this product is that it doesn't smell very good. I am not sure if it moisturizes very well b/c I hate to use due to the odor.
3,Superseded by The Unabridged Journals,"Fran McCullough had a very difficult time with Ted Hughes, who kept requesting deletions of material from Plath's journals. I examined McCullough's work that is available in the Ted Hughes Papers at Emory University and in McCullough's own collection at the University of Maryland."
5,An Essential Book,"If you love Sylvia Plath's amazing poetry; if you have an affinity for either reading journals, or writing your own; or if you simply have an interest in the lifestyles and choices of women of some 50 years ago, these collected journals are a must."
5,A wonderful inspiring book for adventurerers of all ages,Luminous watercolors and a straightforward writing style serve to enchant the reader without over-romanticizing a true story. I look forward to more by this author.
4,Gritty determination,"The spirit of the times at the turn of the last century was driven by all the dazzling transportation ""firsts"" -- FIRST solo Atlantic flight, FIRST woman Atlantic flight, FIRST cross-country flight, FIRST black coast-to-coast flight, and on and on.This book details the first coast-to-coast car trip by a woman, in 1909. The roads were wretched, the directions were laughable, the car was fickle, and her friends were so much ballast. But she made it.This is a good historical story, with context and GREAT illustrations. It is not a full biography, so check with the teacher before your child chooses Alice Ramsey for a biography book report."
4,Very factual,"I received three books by this author for Christmas from my Secret Santa at LibraryThing. Of the three, I think this is the weakest. Instead of focusing on Alice Ramsey's life, it covers only her first trip across the nation. I would rather have seen more information about her instead of just facts about the trip.However, the trip is covered in a clear and factual way, and it is interesting in and of itself, even if it's not what I was expecting in a biography. It's bound to be interesting to anybody who wants a change from the normal Women's History lineup of Earheart and Curie and Helen Keller, or to any child particularly interested in cars... especially if they're girls and are getting the idea that it's *wrong* for girls to like cars, that that's a boy thing.I worry that I'm judging it unfairly and comparing it to the other two books I have by this author, which are just so good, so I'll give it a full 4 stars and leave it at that."
2,Just OK,"This book was JUST OK... sometimes the author got so wrapped up into giving the information that ""storyline"" for children might have been lost a little. MORE isn't always Better."
4,Interesting Role Model!,"I'd never heard of Alice Ramsey until recently, so I was glad to be able to read about her cross-country driving adventure in this children's book! I admire Ramsey's sense of adventure and spunkiness; this book made me want to learn more about her and about her trip! I enjoyed the illustrations, too."
2,Extremely messy.,"I thought this would be fun, but it is extremely messy and the chalk doesn't mark all that neatly. Once the kids are done, they are covered in chalk dust. I can't imagine it's good to breathe in, either. Unless you go out there to give the sidewalk a good washing, the markings do stay on the sidewalk for a long time.I wouldn't recommend giving this as a gift to any child, unless you harbor a deep-seated dislike for the parent. If you are buying it for your child, you have been forewarned. Proceed at your own risk."
5,Breaking down the Hierarchy,"If Riane Eisler's CHALICE AND THE BLADE (C&B) excited you (or if you're dying to read it), and you'd like to share it with others, this book is for you. Begin to break down the dominator paradigm by sitting in a circle with a bunch of friends or fellow travellers and working the exercises in this book.THE PARTNERSHIP WAY provides nine ""lessons"" which guide a group through C&B. This path is structured so that the group follows it together, without relying on the ""authority"" of a ""leader."" The experience of covering this material in a ""partnership way"" is what they didn't teach you in school. Learning to work together without ranking ourselves is a skill that we lost thousands of years ago. This book presents an opportunity for those who would like to reclaim that skill."
2,What is the light output,"This long wordy description manages to not tell us what the lumen output of these bulbs are, which I believe is a legal requirement for at least the packaging. 20,000 hours burning 60 watts with the output of a Christmas light is going to hurt the wallet at $3 a bulb when compact fluorescents are $2 a bulb in the same quantity package at Wal-Mart."
3,Okay for the money,"The set was okay for the price of it; although it would have been better at $[...]. My son has fun as long as the parts stay as a whole, but a couple of the parts keep coming off after he puts them together."
5,My Compliments to Gloria D. Tillis Jones,"Book Review for ""Trilogy of Women""""Trilogy of Women"" is comprised of three stories. The 1st story, titled ""Mama Creole"", takes an intriguing look into the life of a charming lady called Mama Creole. The 2nd story, titled ""Triple Threat"", contains all sorts of mysterious twists and turns. Each compelling you to keep reading to find out what'll happen next {I must admit the ending surprised even myself and I was on the lookout for one final twist}. The 3rd story, which is titled ""Gendercide"", is a story about betrayal amongst women and contains important lessons for all of us, regardless of gender.>All three storylines captivated my interest and I found myself easily drawn to the characters........especially Mama Creole. My compliments to Gloria Tillis Jones for having written such a splendid book! A five star rating well-deserved. I'm looking very forward to reading more books written by Gloria Tillis Jones."
3,Pyle turntable,Turntable was as described. I hooked it up to my high-end Yamaha preamp and adcom amp with Thiel speakers. Turntable replace a Technics turntable. The only problem I noticed was rumbling noise from poor dampening. That was why I returned it. If you don't play music too loud will do the job.
4,Fried on the delivery day,"I received the turntable in perfect condition. The electricity in my apartment is 220V, alhtough it's written on the product manual, on amazon and on Pyle's website that it has an Automatic Voltage Switch, well it doesn't... so my turntable was fried on the first day.The disc plate has two small holes, you have to turn the disc plate manually in order to place one of the holes over a 110/220V switch, only reachable by a small screwdriver.. YEY! but it was too late for me..Although i sent my complaint to the Pyle company to modify the info in their product manual.. they didn't even care to reply or apologize.I managed to fix it at a repair shop, cost me 45$.Now back to the turntable, it's of very good quality, the sound is amazing,(you have to buy a phono amp, a good one is for about 35$, or you can't hear the sound on your HIFI).."
1,Worst Turntable Ever!,I should have known a turntable costing 65 bucks would be a piece of junky plastic not worthy of a Fisher-Price kids toy. I wasted the cost of shipping and the return shipping. The best part of the experience was getting a full refund of the turntable cost. As soon as I returned the item I searched Ebay and located a 70's era Sanyo direct drive turntable with an Empire cartridge and stylus that a private owner sold me for about the same amount of money....it is of high quality and I am very happy with the used unit. If you enjoy playing old albums either spend at least 200 bucks for a new TT or look for someone selling a good turntable from the 70's or 80's. Stay away from the Pyle PLTTB1 as it is a piece of junk made in China!
5,Great value,"After watching my old turntable bite the dust I searched for another. All I could find were those ""Scratcher"" type turntables until I came across this one. Great value and comes with a very good cartridge. You will need a pre-amp for a new receiver but those are plentiful. Very good sound quality but you must ground this unit to prevent an annoying hum. Wish it had a auto return but it's no big deal. I would recommend this turntable for anyone with a vinyl collection. My records never sounded better. I am using this along with a digital converter to transfer my vynil collection (1200 lps) to mp3."
4,A decent starter VINYL turntable....,"Pyle PLTTB1 Professional Belt-Drive Manual TurntableI am a beginner DJ and was looking for some Vinyl Turntables so I can try mixing Vinyl Records like the original DJs. I figured that the Pyle PLTTB1 Pro can do the trick. The nice features about this product is the pitch control and the weight/counter weight adjuster. The only thing that is setting this back from receiving a perfect score is the needle. The needle may require your attention from time to time but overall ok.Overall, I think the Pyle PLTTB1 Pro is good for a beginner, I think that the player can use more refinement. However, since I managed to have great luck with them, I am giving this a four out of five stars. Remember, you get what you pay for.-JC Mixer"
4,Great sound for the price,"This is a great record player for the price. The sound output is of good quality and record player itself works very well. Just ensure that you purchase a pre-amp if your receiver doesn't have one built-in. The only other complaint I had was the installation of the belt. Based on the instructions the belt should have been as simple putting your finger down into the hole where the belt was visible and attaching it, that wasn't the case. I had to remove the top assembly because the belt had come loose in shipping and manually install it from there."
1,piece of junk didn't work,"When the turntable arrived I was pretty psyched, but as soon as I took it out of the box it was evident that this thing was not a quality product. It was mostly comprised of cheap made in china plastic. Once I set it up I couldn't get the tone arm adjusted properly, the counterweights were not sensitive at all. Once I was finally satisfied with the tone arm I set a record on the platter, but the needle just sat on the edge of the disk and didn't follow the track towards the center of the record. If you want a turntable and this is your price range, go on ebay and find a German made player from the 70s or 80s. It will cost the same as this, but look so much more classy and sound so much better."
5,Great product for the price,"This is a great turntable for $69.99 but just keep in mind that the msrp for this turntable is $180.00 so you're actually getting a really good deal on a turntable that does really well. I've had this turn table for quite some time now and I must say that this machine has far exceeded my expectations. When I first bought this turntable I didn't expect much cause it was so inexpensive. But after playing some of my old frank sinatra records, I must say that the sound quality is great. This is a nice and solid turntable without all the bells and whistles. If you want to enjoy all your 33's and 45's this is the machine for you. You can't go wrong with this machine...so ""ADD TO CART"""
4,Nice for the price...,"It's cheap and it works. That's the most important thing. It doesn't have a robotic arm or autoloader, but it does play records and they sound great. Just remember, you need a phono input on your receiver, or a pre-amp to use this record player. Otherwise, the volume will be really, really low. My main receiver didn't have a phono amp, so I was a little disapointed, but a cheaper older stereo we had worked fine, and now I can listen to the few records I have without trouble. The unit itself appears to be very sturdy, and will last a long time."
2,Plasticky,"I returned this immediately - not sure what part of this turntable constitutes ""professional"". The plastic is very cheap, it is very lightweight and I was pretty disappointed all round.The sound wasn't too bad, but I definitely would not recommend."
3,Mixed Reaction,"I picked this up because I am studying forensic psychology and it looked good from the outside. I am disappointed however, in the lack of confirmation of the ""facts"" in the book. I can spot one bad mistake in the book- in the Hope Rippey/Toni Lawrence letters bio, she names Mary Tackett as the instigator, when the actual instigator was Melinda Loveless. There are numerous books on this murder case, and it is a well known fact Loveless was the instigator. With a grandiose mistake like this, it leaves one to wonder how many other mistakes Ms. Furio makes? Since she leaves her letters to the women out of the book (as she does in her other book about male serial killers) one has to wonder just what she says to the killers and in the case of the male book, whether or not she's leading them on. I wasn't satisfied after I finished reading it, but it was interesting to at least hear a different side and hear from the killers themselves. -J"
3,Through Logan's Eyes,"How does Logan see the world? We've never really known. How does he explain Kristy, Jessi and the gang, and especially his girlfriend, Mary Anne to the reader? Does he notice Claudia's unique style? Stacey's looks? Find out how Logan, the only boy baby-sitter in the club, feels about it all. Being different. Being teased. Three stars- average"
3,Logan has a choice to babysit or not,It was pretty good. Logan loves baby sitting but hates being teased. It was suspenceful but kind of boring
4,"Seems like it should work, but for how long?","I had to take the bolts out to bolt on the old bracket from the old actuator, the cap just falls off, not even sure why its there, its only a metal cap and it doesnt cover anything, the motor is inside the sealed plastic, unlike the OEM which when the bolts are removed, the metal housing is actually part of the motorhopefully this lasts, the Doorman unit has worse reviews but looks more like the OEM, the one i received is just like the user picture posted, silver cap, not the bronze looking cap as pictured, probably better to just pay the $45 for an OEM unit with a dust boot and bracketoh, to get the OEM bracket to fit i had to shave down the plastic nubs on the bottom.... for what this costs i guess i just expected more, but if it lasts as long as the OEM i will be happy"
3,A bit different then the original,"I broke the original and was very excited to find this replacement. Although it was the same product, this jar seemed to be a bit wider at the top. The lid needs a lot of muscle to get it down. It doesn't fit on as nicely as the original. With that said, I am glad to have found this on Amazon."
4,Great except lid doesn't fit.,"I bought this to replace the Cuisinart blender jar my toddler broke. It's a great replacement that fits into the blender base perfectly. The only problem is that the jar is wider than the original, and so the original lid does not fit. I've been using it with a towel or plate over the top. Annoying!"
3,Hard to read the dial,"Returned the watch. It was very nice but the hands and the dial face are so similar in color it was very difficult for me to tell the time with this watch. I did buy the gold case, blue dial automatic from invicta and it is beautiful and easy to read."
5,Invicta #2155,"This is my Fourth Invicta. Like the others this one looks like it costs 10 times the actual amount, and having a quartz movement it keeps perfect time.I'm very pleased with each and every one of these time pieces. They are great values."
2,"way too expensive, will shrink","I don't know why these pants are so expensive, cheap material, they will shrink cold cycle or not, not impressed at all"
4,"Nice set, smaller than anticipated",Great little set of hand drawn color(mostly) illustrations of the different modes of transportation. Be aware the books are only like 6x6 inches. All in all a nice Time Life set to add to our collection of books.
4,Still useful for initial study or review of Boolean algebra,"Although this book was printed nearly thirty years ago, the content still provides value; in fact it is roughly the first two chapters of the book that I last used for a college course in digital logic for computer scientists. Boolean algebra is the fundamental mathematics used to represent the action of basic computer circuits such as the adder/subtractor and the flip-flop. The representation of numbers in binary and arithmetic as performed in binary are also covered. There are many diagrams of switches and logic gates to emphasize how the devices are implemented.This book remains a solid introduction to Boolean algebra as it is applied to basic computer circuitry, it can be used for initial study or as a refresher."
4,Sparkplug Wires,"Ordered wires from another company and got the wrong ones, no follow up. Got the wrong wires from this company. I email them and they found the right wires. Thanks Dennis."
1,"Tired, old scripts that turn off listeners","I sell my services as a scientific consultant and I have learned that prospective clients are interested in themselves, not in me. As I redirect my professional practice and revitalize my marketing/selling program, I have read many helpful books. All the professional services marketing books stress the importance of focusing on benefits. So does a very good cold call selling book I just read. Goldner's book, in contrast, never mentions benefits to the prospect, only features offered by the caller. His scripts have the same artificial structure that turns off my interest immediately when telemarketers call me. I know I'm not alone in this response. I am very disappointed in this book and it will not remain in my library."
2,You have got to be kidding me,"Ok, I am a new sales rep, and I thought this book would make a difference for me. Well the only difference that it made for me was in my wallet, which is unfortunately much lighter now. The book had some good advice, but not worth all of the filler which the author overwhelms you with just so that they can sell a book. Save yourself the time, see if it is out in cliff notes. 10 pages was all this book really neede to cover the points that this guy wanted to make. Save yourself time and effort and look elsewhere."
3,"Decent, but....","Nothing new here. Want a good tonic for your sales slumps? It's called ""Wall Street"" and it's not a book--it's a movie. Breathe that movie's creeds and you will succeed..."
2,"Flimsy, junky, ill-fitting","I ordered the OEM-190-180 Grass catcher for my 2003 Mower. I was sent the newer, supposedly more expensive model -OEM-190-180A. It did NOT fit. My mower's discharge chute is a definite rectangle. The opening of the tube on the catcher chute had one corner molded and shaped in a weird way. It would not could not fit. The person at the Outdoor Store was polite and as helpful as she could be, but insisted that it should fit my mower, and was the same as the older model. She gave me a number for the technicians at the factory. I ended out modifying an old part of my retired Cub Cadet grass catcher. Oh Yeah, when I received the box and opened it, one of the bags was broken - the flimsy top plastic rim. Should have been made of metal. It took 2 weeks to be sent a new one, though the Store was good about it. Overall, the whole thing [except the parts made of metal] was very flimsy and poorly designed. Definitely not worth the $300+ ."
5,OEM Bagger,"I have a Toro LX 425 that is apparently made by MTD, the bagger fit without any issues and installed it in about 30 minutes. Great product and Great Price, if you buy the Toro branded on it will cost you $400, this one with shipping was roughly $270."
3,Arnold's grass catcher,A lot more complicated to install that was published. Certain parts had to be bent to be installed. Grass is not distributed equally to both bags. If grass is wet it gets clogged in the chute.
2,Incomplete Product,"Product received was insufficient to complete project. Had to order additional items at a cost of an additional $30 to complete installation. Vendor should note this on site. Note: My model and serial Number was provided before purchase. Actually, the manufacturer should provide the items with the original item."
3,MTD Twin Grass Collector,"The price on this finally fell to one I could afford and I purchased it this spring. Assembly and attachment was easy. The collector works well as long as the grass in fairly dry and not too tall. If you are cutting early in the morning or more than about an inch at a time, it will clog up often and then you have to stop and take the tube off and clear it. Also has a problem filling both bags equally so I had to modify the dump tube over the bags to make that work. Overall, the product works as well as it can without being one of the pricier ones that have a blower assist."
4,grass collector,I ordered the Arnold Twin Bag Grass Collector for my Yard Man Tractor. It arrived within the specified time and was easy to install. I used it to pick up leaves and it did a good job. It does fill quickly with a thick cover of leaves but still easier than raking. I have about an acre of yard with many trees. It took about four hours to complete. I'm very happy with this product.
4,Good product...but...,"I own a 2003 model lawn tractor and the mounting was not as expected. I had to drill all new mounting holes to mount the bag bracket onto the back. What was billed as a ""quick attachment"" took several hours and included removing both back wheels from the mower. Once I finally got the bagger mounted I was very happy with its performance."
4,It would work great if your rotor is threaded,"For some reason not all Harley Davidson Alternator Rotors are threaded. Mine is not, but the same year/model of a friend's bike is. This is a great tool, well built. Make sure you can use it before buying. 4 stars for quality"
5,Some Wonderful DeShannon Early Material,"I was unaware of this album till I came across a copy in New Zealand (of all places).I've never seen a copy in Australia and didn't realise it was available for purchase.I was particularly impressed with Jackie's voice and delivery of these wonderful songs.Her raspy voice sounds very much like that of Brenda Lee which adds to the quality of these well produced songs.While I have a number of albums of Jackie, I hold this one in high esteem and it certainly contributes a great deal to her reputation and versatility as one of the great singer song-writer recording artists of all time.She certainly delivers.Thank you for these very interesting versions, Jackie and Jack!"
4,Back to basics,"Full of the basics to get any soon-to-be Photoshoper off the ground with CS2. Lots of examples on virtually every page, step you through real-world situations, clearly and quickly.A few good sections on Bridge, Version Cue and Searching right at the beginning ensure you don't make a mess later on as you wade through all the chapters devoted to Photoshop, Indesign, Illustrator, GoLive, and Acrobat.While it does cover Photoshop basics such as removing color casts, red eye, setting up printers and placing text on paths...it also details how it efficiently ties into all the other Adobe applications found in CS2.And how to make the most of your time - a good general book for beginners but even advanced users may glean new insights if they haven't tried CS2's new features."
4,Practical recipes for real world problems,"This book presents a set of recipes for using the Adobe product suite. The recipes are well chosen and are described in a terse style that works for this type of content. My only gripe is that the examples could have been a little better. With books that cover products like Photoshop I like to not only learn the techniques, but be inspired by the example material in the book itself. And that's why I rate this book a 4 and not a 5."
4,Good,Good product. Alittle difficult to set the compass. City mode is the best mode to use. It does pick up some of store motion sensors but all in all its great for the price.
3,Display is hard to see in bright sunlight,"I have only had this product for a few days so I can't address many issues with the radar, but I can warn people about the display. I've had another whistler detector for around 7 years now but the speaker has given out and I can't find a new speaker to replace it. My previous detector used the same LED display as this one but was sunken inside the housing to shade the display somewhat. This one does not so I find it harder to read in bright sunlight (even on the brightest setting). A detector does not do you much good if you can't read the display clearly.I liked my previous detector so I stayed with Whistler, but looks like I made a mistake."
3,"Good detection, bad display","I purchased this detector as it seemed like a great deal for the price. It did actually perform fairly well, I never had a problem with it detecting, only issue is the display. As others have mentioned, the display is very hard to read during the day, especially in sunlight."
3,"OK, especially for the money.","This is one of the best budget buys in radar detection, but that's exactly what it is, a budget buy."
2,"May clean, but deposits dust to center of the disc!","While this cleaner does get rid of the dust and dirt that happens to be on your CD's or DVD's, the circular nature of the cleaning pads rotates the dust and such that it is cleaning to the center of the discs. While I can't tell if it interferes with the performance of the disc, it is certainly quite annoying to have all that stuff on the disc when you just supposedly cleaned it. Additionally, the cleaning pads get dirty after only a few cleanings, and the brush that is supposed to be used to clean them doesn't work at all.If you are looking for a cheap disc cleaning solution, I'm sure you can find a solution that is just as cheap but it much more effective than this particular brand of cleaner. I chose this over others simply because Belkin made it, but you shouldn't necessarily trust a product because it's made by a big brand (as in this case)."
3,It wasn't what I expected,It's not that great. It's really manual work. You have to spin the knob until you hand gets tired. If you have alot of CDs or DVDs to clean.
5,Best bang for the buck!,"Simple, effective, and easy to use. Does a good job of cleaning those finger print ridden Blu-ray/DVD rentals. Spin it around ten times and your and your done. Streak free in about 5-10 seconds with the provided solution. I have tried a couple of different automatic cleaners, and this seems to be more effective."
4,Two thumbs up.....,"IMO, Invasion is as good as their first release. This was true party / glam metal at its best and I still listen to this cd today. Ratt are / were bigtime and I was there in the mid 80's listening to them, Motley, Dokken, WASP and LA Guns. It was the best era of all."
5,RATT & Roll!!!,"I grew up listening to Ratt.I used to own an LP version of this album, but now I get to listen to it on CD.Each song has its own flavor to it, but my favorite would be ""You should Know by Now.""The guitar solos by Warren and Robyn in this song are one of the rockest solos from 80's heavy metal."
1,Plague,"Hair bands were a disgrace to rock and metal, and RATT was one of the worst of them. Just seeing the way these guys. used to dress made me wanna vomit.Ratt had some talent (guitarrist Warren De MArtini was really gifted, but the songs were just straight ahead glam of the worst kind!!"
3,Too Much Love,"I liked the album ""Out of the Cellar"" a lot so I figured I would give this album a shot. I had heard the song ""Lay It Down"" on the internet and it intrigued me so I decided to get this album. The album has the traditional Hair Metal style but pretty much every song on here is about love. With no variety in topic the album seems kind of lame. ""What You Give Is What You Get"" and ""Lay It Down"" are the stand out songs on this album. Not bad to listen to at all, but you could have a better time listening to ""Out of the Cellar."""
3,Not that Ratt enough,"I was twelve when I first listened to te record, at my cousin's basement. I liked it a lot for it was my first heavy metal experience, and I became a big fan of ratt's. I must say that this record it's kinda boring, almost every song sound the same. It has nice riffs, though. Pearcy's voice is great, De Martini plays like he's reading the notes, Blotzer's drummig is always great. But, the thing is, this album has no life in it. It's not like ""out of the cellar, dancing undercover or any other"". The lyrics, though are very sexual and ""implicit"" in a way. But that's all there is to ""Invasion"".I personally like ""Lay it down"", ""What you give is what you get"", and ""Dangerous but worth the risk"".If you're a big fan of Ratt, buy it and complete your collection.But if you're just starting in to the 80's heavy metal or want to listen to Ratt, start with any other record."
3,or maybe 2.5...,"Ratt belong in the same category as Cinderella, Poison, Mötley Crüe, Icon, Warrant, and Winger to name a few. ""Invasion of your privacy"" is actually a rather decent album and may not be as slick or polished you'd suppose. The opening ""You're in love"" is more of a rocker than a metal-poser-thing a la Poison's ""Unskinny bop"", and there's other good tunes as well, like ""Lay it down"". The material on this album is much better than the singer, and with a more masculine and powerful vocalist, the songs on this album would in fact be very good. But a part of the whole L.A. metal scene was clearly to recruit singers who sounded just like Ratt's. Too bad!"
3,"Worth Buying For ""Lay It Down"" alone","Lay It Down is the best song on this album. Another song that comes close is ""Dangerous But Worth The Risk"". ""You're In Love"" is great, too. Warren Demartini is one of the best guitar players of the 80s or any decade."
2,Two and a half for a decent rock album,"I bet when Ratt coined their album 'Invasion of your privacy' all those years ago they never imagined the term would become so popular years later, meaning many things to so many people! Of course, back in '85, these guys were just looking at girls.But when listening to this invasion of privacy, it seems that there isn't much meat on the bone. They get that 80's party rock beat, anthemic chorus, guitar solo, and very lean on the songwriting.The opening 'You're in love' is an excellent rock anthem with great riffs, 'Lay it down' is a very good song, and 'Between the eyes' is different enough to be interesting.Apart from that, the songs aren't bad, but there is very little depth in the songwriting, just chugging out that stadium sound and shifting the units."
2,Could have been better,"I saw the You're in Love video and loved everything about that video, the songs that followed this track on the CD however seemed a bit less. As I would soon discover, it appears that Ratt used a lot of the same songs on CD from CD which made the collection as a whole somewhat not as good as others I've seen. Great look, but as for me and my taste this CD just wasn't on target. Try again."
1,"Tha package came imcomplete, I sent it back","I bought it but i sent it back because the package came with just 2 shield, the frame and another shield was missing, I got my money back later on"
3,Worst season yet,"I chose this rating because it was still watchable, but it was the worst season of Caifornication yet. It seemed a lot more predictable than before and it seemed like they ran out of ideas. I would still recommend if for watching for hardcore fans of this series."
4,Excellent as usual.,"No I've become so accustomed to great season after season, this rating comes as no surprise to me. I can't wait for season 6 to come out on instant..."
3,"Still good, but losing its edge.","A fun series still, but this season's scripts and story arc didn't captivate the attention as previous seasons had. If another season is in the works, I hope the series's freshness and pizzazz can be restored."
5,Great show,"I find this show fascinating, and at times depressing. I just got around to watching season 5, and there have been changes in the lives of the characters. Looking forward to finishing it!"
5,..it just gets better and better!,"There isn't much to say, the story is great, the actors ""rock"", and foremost David Duchovny was born to play this part, to be Hank Moody!I hope there'll be tons of more seasons coming!I really love to watch it, its funny, gripping, dramatic, ""realistic-ish"" and there is alcohol and sex..so what is there not to like!"

1,Deceiving description,Beware. The description says it is a 5 pack. It is in fact only a 1 pack. It comes in an unsealed static bag. I exchanged it and the new one was the same way.I never tested the performance of the card.
5,Rey Leon,"This is a great soundtrack, it's fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do"
1,Terrible product,"The aerosol spray is very bad. Two different bottles stopped spraying when still half full. It cleans well, but the aerosol spray wastes half the bottle"
1,used as instructed. left with a streaky oven.,"I used this product to clean a barely used, but expensive, oven before new tenants moved in. After cleaning (and precisely following instructions), the oven is left with permanent streaks. I've spent hours trying to remove the streaks.I advise caution when using this product"
3,"not really ""plans"", but offsets and hints are included","I bought this book for the scaled-down plans so I wasn't happy to discover there aren't dimensions given on many of the drawings (bulkheads, deck, etc), they more resemble advertisements for the full scale plans which are sold separately. However full hull offsets are provided which is the one part you can't figure out on your own, as well as clear simple assembly hints. I'm an engineer with zero woodworking or fiberglass experience, I was able to build a beautiful, simple kayak from this book."
5,Stitch and glue boatbuilding is an awsome book!,"The book is very well written and very informative. The plans are a bit small, but since they do include matrix numbers, you could use them to build the boats. I am very excited about building the boat and I hope that I will be able to afford the material soon."
1,bad sound quality,"The sound quality was very poor. The voices of the characters were not audible. Their mouths would move but no sound came out. And I know how the movie should sound as I saw it when it first came out. However, I was able to hear the sounds from the weapons launched by the Blue Meanies, the sounds from the car, the sounds of footsteps, and part of the songs.Very unhappy . . ."
5,"Touching, uplifting , soothing, sometimes haunting music","Somewhere between Joni Mitchell, Nelly Furtado, Enya, Celine Dion and Judy Collins, you'll find Jan Garrett. Gently, passionately, from the heart she touches places and visions it feels good to go to, or with.There's something about her music which reminds me of the best songs Disney has matched up with it's best animations- from Pocahontas (Listen With Your Heart, Colors of the Wind,) to Little Mermaid (part of your world), and Beauty and The Beast (title song.) No, I'm not a kid. I am 50 years old.Jan's songs are not created for children (well they are fine for kids, but they are created mostly for adults. I just feel that she could do a soundtrack for a Disney film and it would have a total Disney feel. She is a total pro and the songs are great. The two Jan Garrett CDs I own have seen far more than the average number of plays in our house and car."
4,A good purchase,"I'm not disappointed in this book. I'm glad I ordered it especially for the price. The drawings are done very well. However, the details are intricate. The eyes are too small even with sharp colored pencils. For someone like me who does not like to draw and would rather paint, this book came in handy. Not a big deal I know, for some, but it is to me. The other thing I didn't like is that there are no backgrounds drawn into each page with the women. Also, there is wasted space above the written description of the fashion and some more details could have been drawn there as well to go along with that particular fashion. Even with that said, I recommend this coloring book and the product link I have inserted here. Godey's Fashions is still my favorite so far.Godey's Fashions Coloring Book (Dover Pictorial Archives)"
2,Totally crushed...,"Tasty, but arrived crushed. No, I did not order other heavy things with this item, it was the only thing in there, yet I opened the box to find the corn in several pieces in the bag. It looked like it was the candy corn no one wanted to buy after Halloween, if you know what i mean. There was not one perfect looking corn in there. For me, this was a huge bust because I was going to make candy corn cupcakes for Halloween, and these were going to be the decoration on top. 2 stars though because it tastes good. Not the best ive ever tasted, but it makes for a good snack. Again though, it really was disappointing for all of them to be crushed. I'll probably just take the 4 mile drive to buy some for a bit cheaper next time. Those I know won't be crumbled."
2,brach's candy corn,"I was disappointed with this purchase.I had wanted to place the candies in a glass container for use as Halloween decor as well as to be eaten. When the package arrived, most of the candies were broken, smashed together and sticky. We ate the candies, but I could not put them out on display, as was my intent."
1,Not as good as we thought....,"I purchased this item yesterday, also set it up as shown. There is a little plastic gray piece that sticks up and doesnt let the cars go through. We have yet also to get ONE car through. A huge disappointment to my son who was excited about it. But I called Mattel and they gave me a gift card for the amount i purchased it for. Great customer service. I think this product should be recalled because the cars do shoot back at you at an alarming speed. Hit my son in the head."
1,bad design,"It looks like there is a 'safety catch' on the first ramp that stops the car right out of the gate. No idea what it is there for, or how it is supposed to be set-- there is no mention of it in the instructions or Mattel's support site. As such it doesn't work at all."
2,Awful.,"This toy looks like it would be a lot of fun if it actually worked as it's supposed to. It is almost impossible for the cars to stay on the track yet alone go through the loop. In addition, it's poorly made. The track pieces come apart with the slightes move. Don't waste your money."
3,"Good idea, bad design",I bought this item because my baby was over 25 lbs at 5 months and outgrew his baby bjorn. For heavier babies I found that it dug into my neck and cause a muscular pain in my neck similar to migraine neck pain. I don't recommend it for heavy babies - it will likely be suitable for lighter babies.
3,not what I expected,"The Hip Hammock sure does take the pressure off the back when carrying a baby; But unfortunately, it shifts the pressure on the neck instead of the back, and for me it was a more straneous pain than having the pressure on the back. Plus, the baby didn't seem very comfortable at all, our arms got on our way a lot.It did not work for me!"
1,Uncomfortable!,I wore this for 15 minutes and my neck and shoulder hurt the rest of the day. I am a medium sized woman and my baby is 18 lbs. I was constantly tugging on the shoulder pad because it was digging into my shoulder and neck. Plus my baby was sweating and it was a cool 60 degrees. I also had to keep an arm around him anyway.
3,"Great concept, poor pad","I love this product, except for one really significant deficiency. Within two weeks of getting it the pad that keeps the strap from digging into your neck got twisted, with the strap inside so twisted and smooshed together that we could not get it straightened out. Because there is no way to take the pad off and straighten out the strap it is practically impossible to fix this problem.That said, the idea behind this sling is AWESOME. My little boy (8 mos) is big for his age, and reaches for everything, so this is a great way to keep him close and relatively contained. I used the Baby Bjorn for my older daughter and definitely prefer this -- I haven't even put him in the Bjorn since he could hold his head up. He loves the Hip Hammock and can be relied on to nap in it, as well. If the strap weren't a problem I would give this product 5 stars, hands down."
2,never felt secure,"Playtex gets points for trying, but I never felt my son was secure in this. We bought it when he was 8 months old and took it on a vacation with us, and when we got home I returned it. I always felt he was in danger of falling out one side; all he would have had to do was put his arm under one of the top straps. I did not find it particularly supportive either; I was tired after just a few minutes.We got a Next Generation Ergo to replace this, and it was MUCH better."
1,WARNING: THIS HAS BEEN RECALLED,"I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about when s/he says this is ""not the recalled one"". I was just at a major retailer today and the recall notice was prominently posted. My advice: Check the manufacturers website for details before you buy!"
3,Hurts my neck,"I like the idea of this sling, but the strap kept digging into my neck and since I have an arm around behind my baby, my arm and shoulder began hurting. I think it's great for quick chores around the house like when you're trying to wash a pan and your baby wants ""Up!"", but other than that it would hurt wearing it."
1,Not comfortable!,I did not like this hammock. It cuts across your neck and I do not feel like my son is securely in there. I always have to have at least one hand holding him. The front carriers are the way to go since they leave your hands free to do things.
2,Keep your receipt handy just in case,"I bought this reluctantly after reading the other reviews. I found that it dug into the base of my neck. After about 20 minutes day 1 I was done. I tried giving it another chance a few days later, but found the same thing again. I returned it less than a week later. My child is on the lighter end of the weight limit too. The concept is good, maybe I had the adjustments wrong."
2,More like a Shoulder hammock,"I got this when my daughter started to outgrow her front carrier. No matter how many times I adjusted it, all her weight was supported by my shoulder instead of on my hip. Plus, with the baby positioned on your side, it really only frees up one hand instead of both. I could more comfortably hold her on my hip without the hammock than with it. So what's the point? She didn't like it very much either. Wish I would have returned it."
2,Ended up returning,In theory this is a great product! My daughter loves to be held this way so I thought it would be great - she's too big for the bjorne... The shoulder strap cut into my shoulder (I am only 5'1) so badly that I couldn't wear it. I ended up returning it.
5,BEST BABY CARRIER EVER!,"After going through four different types of carriers that either hurt the neck or back or baby grew out of way too fast, we settled on this carrier as soon as the baby reached the weight recommended. She LOVES this carrier and we do, too! The weight distribution is perfect so as to not strain Mom and Dad's neck or back, etc. Plus with the little strap to hold toys, pacifiers, etc., the baby has built-in entertainment. This is also extremely easy to use and adjust, unlike many other carriers that have a multitude of straps that need to be adjusted every single time you put them on or a different person wears them. I really HIGHLY recommend this carrier, plus it is so economical!"
4,Handy but Hot,"I love the hip hammock and so does my baby (who just loves to be carried around). The only unfortunate piece is that the material doesn't breathe very well and my baby has gotten overheated in the summer. I believe the deluxe edition of this product is made from a nice material ... I would have checked this out more carefully had I known then what I know now. BTW, the hammock folds unto itself in a neat, easy package and is comfortably portable (I can bundle it and tie with the attached button and easily put in my diaper bag)."
2,"Good, but uncomfortable","This sling is the third I've tried!! It's comfortable for only 20-30 minutes but then after that, it starts hurting your back. The puffy strap cuts into your neck and it's quite painful if your child weighs alot. My son is 13 months and 18 pounds. He's small for his age but I noticed that even at his weight pain comes with the sling. I sometimes feel like he is going to fall out of on the the leg openings because it is so big. I recommend that if your baby is heavy, it's just better to place him in a stroller. This sling was not comfortable for me at all. So I've returned it and am going to try a new one."
1,Original one is better,"I went to purchase this for a friend but see that when Playtex bought the rights for this carrier they changed it, and not for the better. My sister and I both had the original design and it was meant for babies. It is too bad they changed it. Our husbands would use it since it was not girly looking like the wrap ones you see now. Which I hear are not only unattractive but hard on the back and neck."
1,Worthless!,"When I heard this product was back in the store, I rushed out and picked one up. It seemed like such a good idea to me, I always carry my baby on my hip, but she is 9 months old and 24 lbs. so it's really difficult. I thought this would be a great help. It is so uncomfortable! The strap that was up by my neck was choking me and the strap is scratchy and uncomfortable. My daughter kept trying to lean over the side because she felt uncomfortable too, and if you don't position them properally they can slide through the leg openings. I don't see any possible way to use this without keeping one hand on your child, which it actually says in the instructions, so what's the point?! I tried this out a few times thinking maybe I was doing something wrong, but it's the same everytime, and now when I try to put my daughter in it she screams! In my opinion this is a worthless and very disapointing product!"
2,"Good Concept, but not comfortable","This is a good concept. I like how there is a place to attach toys and your keys. It's super easy to put on, too (which isn't always the case with baby carriers.) I gave this item a 2 because the strap is very uncomfortable. I can not comfortably wear this for more than a couple of minutes at a time. The strap gets twisted in the pad and the pad ALWAYS ends up facing away from me. My shoulder/neck is very sore after I'm done with it. I would suggest spending the extra money on a carrier with a thicker shoulder strap. I've bought a dozen cheap carriers and I now know that I would have been better off putting all of my money into just one good carrier or sling."
1,Spare your back...use your neck?,"The catch phrase for this is ""Use your hip, spare your back,"" but this hammock put all the weight on my neck. I have to admit that I am a plus sized woman at size 20, but I let my other mom friends try this on before I returned it, and they were all equally dissappointed. I followed the directions carefully, but never managed to comfortably carry my 20 lb 8 month old son for any length of time. From these reviews it looks like this product has worked great for some moms, but for those plus sized mommies out there, it just doesn't work."
2,Did not seem well constructed...,"I bought this item for my 8 month old, but returned it after trying her out in the contraption. The idea seemed ingenious, but, in actuality, the construction just didn't measure up to the Eddie Bauer front carrier that I have (for the same price). The Hip Hammock seemed a bit flimsy and lacking in support and security...I felt like my baby could easily fall out and/or the straps could come undone. I decided it wasn't worth the money I paid and returned it."
4,a little hard to get adjusted right but then very helpful,It takes a little bit to get adjusted but after you get a good fit it is very helpful. My baby did not like it at first but once we got out and going she was fine.
3,breastfeeding mothers may have a hard time,"I really liked the concept of this item, and it worked great for my husband, but being that I am a breastfeeding mother, my daughter landed right in ""the spot"" when I carried her in it and it just seemed to frustrate us both. She could smell my milk and it seemed to drive her nuts. Other than that though, I liked this product."
2,Good for about 5 minutes.,"My son is 10 months old and weighs close to 25 lbs. I put this on , tried adjusting it as much as possible trying to find the comfort but the entire pressure of the baby rests on the neck. I went in and out of Toys R Us to get diapers with this on and when I was done I was left with a red mark on my neck like whiplash. I cannot imagine wearing this with a baby close to 35 pounds. Even though it was not good for me.. my baby seemed very comfortable. I will now look for a back carrier."
1,Very Painful! Great idea but not comfortable for me,"I thought I would love this but just returned it. It hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time (10 minutes?) Maybe I'm too small (5'2"")or my baby (5 months and 18 pounds) is too large. Either way I still find the Bjorn much more comfortable. I would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the Bjorn, but I couldn't stand wearing! Very painful."
1,The Hip Hammock is just dreadful!,"I bought a hip hammock because my daughter had grown out of the snugglie and she still wasn't big enough to sit in a basket on her own, so I thought it would be good for shopping. I tried to adjust that damn thing a bunch of different ways, but never worked right. All of the wieght of my 22lbs. daughter was resting on my neck . .it was dreadful. The weight does not rest on the hip as they say . .they are lying! Don't buy it!"
5,Must have!,I've had this for 4 years and I'm using it for our third child. I much prefer it over the front carriers. It easy to get your child in and out of and much easier on your back then the front carriers. I get so many complements on it. Its a must have; buy one!
5,Amazing!!!!!!,"A must have, this carrier is by far the best for quick trips. It is much easier than other carriers and my son likes it best. It does not replace the ergo for longer trips but it has it's own purpose. (Like running into a store quickly.) If you are carry your baby as much as me, this carrier is one of the top baby items to have!!! Buy it."
4,Twins and flying,"My husband and I purchased 2 of these to go on vacation with our 1 year old twins and 3 year old son. We were originally going to put the girls in individual umbrella strollers to go through the airport, but with three kids it was then, one more thing to carry when it was time to board the plane. I first purchased one to try it out and wore it everyday for 6 weeks and did not experience any pain and my girls loved it. The only complaint that I have is that the staps need a little more adjustment, I am an average person and they didn't go quite small enough for me, and my daughters are tall and thin, but they seem to feel secure!! Great product for the money!!"
2,Expected More,"I was disapointed in this book, I was hoping for more meat and pictures of these guys when they were kids, but the price was inexpensive and there are a few pictures I have never seen anywhere else, plus I did learn a couple new facts so I won't totally say it was a waste. But I was hoping for more."
1,"Magnificent movie, extremely poor DVD quality","I classify this title among the two or three greatest movies ever made, but Simitar has given us absolutely the worst quality DVD I have yet experienced from among the 100+ DVDs I have purchased thus far. Two other Simitar DVD titles (""Sports Blooper Encyclopedia"" and ""The Titanic"") have caused me to conclude that I will never purchase another Simitar DVD. I emailed Simitar suggesting they should recall the DVD, redo it and re-release it using a much better film print. I also suggested they should apologize to their customers. They did not respond."
1,Complete Waste of Money & Film,"Horrible movie throughout. A nothing screenplay with nothing roles.What a waste of the fine talent of young Leonard Whiting...he deserveda much better role in a much better movie, as a follow-up to his superior performance in the role of Romeo in Franco Zeffireilli's ROMEO & JULIET."
2,Interesting Drama / Wretched DVD,"This is an astonishingly bad transfer to DVD for a film that I don't believe is in the public domain -- it's very tough to get through. It's a pity, as this is still an intriguing take on religion and imperialism. Shaw's performance as Pizzaro is both commanding yet convincingly conveys his credulousness in his new surroundings. Plummer as the Incan ruler with his petulant keening is more of a distraction. He sounds like Olivier and looks like Cher.If this were ever restored, I'd give it another go."
1,Royal Hunt of the Missing Scenes,"This is a remarkably amateurish movie based on an intense play. Very poor and strange performances from what could have been a great cast. Not to mention horrible cutting, and camera work. Not at all what I expected."
2,"Tedious tasks, uninspiring cast, awkward host","I'm a huge fan of Project Runway and am often amazed at the drive and sheer skill and creativity the designers show.I had great hopes for this as well but it was a watered down dull copy at best.The hostess was lovely but wooden or painfully over-sincere. The talent feedback often subjective and individual rather than educational and enlightening. The contestant rarely thrilled with their creations and were almost uniformly forgettable as designers.Capable perhaps, but not breathtakingly good or bad for that matter.I watched and watched and hoped for growth or the feeling I was watching talent and creativity but was so uninvested that I didn't care at all who won in the lackluster finale.""Project Accessory"" is the programming equivalent of diet cream-cheese on a day old bagel; wait until you can see it for free on Hulu or something, it's not worth paying to watch."
3,Needs to Change Format,"This show follows every single device of Project Runway, right down to the work being shown on the runway. However, that is the problem. Unlike clothing, accessories coming down the runway are difficult to see and appreciate. Unless an accessory is glaring, it simply doesn't look like much coming down a fashion runway on a model wearing jeans and a tee or a little black dress. This also means that when it something is bad, it is not excruciatingly awful either. And let's face it, people love these shows as much for the spectacular failures as anything else. It is hard to enjoy someone being shredded by the judges for a necklace or a bracelet. I think they may have to use photo shots of the models from a studio shoot instead of a runway show to judge these accessories. If it is a necklace, let's focus on the model's neck with photo closeups. I think this show has possibilities if they start showing the work another way."
3,"Entertaining, But Trying a Little Hard","I love Project Runway, so when this show came out I knew I had to watch it. Overall the first episode is pretty entertaining: there are some pretty crazy designers and it's fun to watch them work through the first challenge. However, I do think this show is trying to be TOO much like Project Runway, and a little differentiation would do it good. I wrote a longer review over on my blog too if you're interested in reading more! [...]"
3,need quality not quantity; materials cheap and look it,"this time the designers had to make 4 beach accessories using items found on the beach adjacent to coney island and items from the beach stores. i was seriously underwhelmed. once again, the whole thing is lost up on a runway. next, the judges were talking about they loved this and they loved that, yadda, yadda. i did not see a single thing i would buy much less love. my guess is the materials were super cheap verging on tawdry. give these designers some better quality materials. then tell them to make only one accessory, not four, then show it in a more intimate setting, not a runway. i am fast losing it with this show and don't think i will be watching it much longer."
2,Biggest Misstep So Far,"This episode had two glaring problems. The first was the use of a catsuit. This outfit is so horrible, sexist and dated that it was virtually an insult to all women to use it in the show. I couldn't get past the catsuits as they came down the runway. They looked so awful that I could not focus on any accessory. It would have been better to use a burlap bag as the outfit.Second was the use of Kelly Osbourne as a judge. This is a woman with no talent other than a big mouth and a celebrity father. She is billed as a ""television personality"" which is to say she has made a name for herself by being linked to a famous person and behaving in an obnoxious manner in public. She also has an atrocious fashion sense. Currently she is keeping her name alive in the media by criticizing Christina Aguilera's body left and right. She seems to miss the fact that the object of her scorn can sing, dance and act, which she cannot.This show needs to do much, much better than this episode."
4,Good product,Works as described. Apple should take a cue from this product and add it to their standard earbuds. Adds comfort and enhances sound quality to a better level.
3,These make the stock Apple buds bearable,"These definitely make the stock buds tolerable, but they did not improve the sound quite enough for my tastes. I've since bought a pair of Ultimate Ears 170 with mic so I don't use these except when I can't find the others. I don't like them much either though. The EarJams seemed to only sound good with the EQ set to Treble Boost, which is not a setting I'd normally pick so they are definitely altering the sound quite a bit, and it's an improvement over not using them. But they are no excuse for a good set of in-ear-canal headphones. When I got them there were not a lot of options for in-ear headsets with a microphone. Not there are. Get one of those instead."
1,is this a joke?,Just received them. There's one small little f@@@g problem. They are TOO LARGE for iPod heahphones. Nobody f@@@@g noticed that?
1,"FAR FROM 20,000 HOURS LIFE","Cheaply made, cheaply packaged, and guess what, it did last any longer than an ordinary bulb, if that. Shocked to see on the flimsy package ""Made In The USA"" - but somehow doubt it is. Aero-Tech doesn't seem to exist outside of Amazon. Save your money, buy a compact fluorescent lamp."
4,One of the two best atlases of NC,"""The Roads of North Carolina"" is an excellent resource for anyone who longs to get off the interstate highways. It's an accurate, essential tool for NC bicyclists because it shows whether roads are paved or unpaved. The atlas has largely reprinted NC DOT's collection of county highway maps. But they're edited, combined, and enhanced in a way that adds considerable value. I'd love to see the same treatment for Virginia and other states. ""The Roads of North Carolina"" works best as a companion to DeLorme's very useful ""North Carolina Atlas & Gazetteer."""
1,duped,"After I received the book, I was puzzled to find that some familiar roads were not shown in the maps. Looking more closely, I discovered that the book was copyright 1989!! Who would sell a 20-year-old map book?? I guess I should have checked it out beforehand, but, come on, clean out the inventory."
3,Intermittently Useful,"This book is handy if you're a playwright looking for good names to imitate. It's handy if you're examining styles popular in short plays (many of them ten minutes or less). It's a neato-jet piece of gear if you're learning the language and jargon of the playwrighting scene.This book is useless if you're a director looking to stage a one-act. The plays are too irregular, and many are too short unless you're running an evening of ten-minute plays. Some are radio plays, which are useless on stage. Some are cuttings or extended monologues. There is no unifying theme through the book, so it's hit-or-miss if what you find will even match any theme you may be looking for.If you know this going in, the book can be useful to you. Many people like it. I found it a drag."
4,It meets my needs for a course in one-act plays,"In the fall, as a volunteer coordinator, I will teach a course in a program for retired people (Quest, which is affiliated with CUNY). In researching materials for this course, I discovered this book. It seems to have a variety of interesting plays by contemporary playwrights."
5,A Lifesaver!,"My Book Club has existed since 1928, but it is called the Book and Play Club. In other words, we are heavily into drama as well as books. This wonderful anthology will serve us well as several times during the club year we like to do readings, monologues, or even perform short plays... perhaps one of our ""originals"" will make it into the next collection by the editor!"
5,If you're new to Ericksonian hypnosis ...,"Hypnotic language patterns are delightful to read and practice. If you're already familiar with Ericksonian hypnosis and hypnotic language patterns than you're not likely to find anything new in this book. However, if you're a practicing hypnotist or hypnotherapist and you've only learned direct language patterns, this spiral-bound book can serve as an easy-to-read introduction to hypnotic language patterns. Learning indirect / conversational hyponsis can help you to greatly improve the success rate of your hypnosis sessions."
5,Really good,Great little book scripts and how to write them. There are several sample scripts along with information on how to write your own. It's a great desk reference.
5,Really excellent book.,I really enjoyed reading this book. The author patiently breaks down the definitions of various conversational hypnosis techniques and provides many examples throughout the book to illustrate practical application. My only complaint is that i wanted more when i reached the end. Excellent book.
5,Conversational Hypnosis,Excellent. Setout as an easy to follow manual. It supplies well thoughtout scripts that give the reader an excellent template for the creation of future scripts.
1,terrible,This is not the appropriate charger. This charger can hardly charge while the device is in use and intermittently will stop chrging. If you are using anything over a 20gig it is difficult to tell whether or not it is actually charging. I am disappionted that this is offered as a replacement charger and still have not found a charger that matches the specs of my original.
5,Too Bad It's Not On DVD,"With Malcom Mcdowell narrating, this documentary takes you through the life of the Beatles, from the time Paul met John right up until Paul released his solo album. Contains footage of the Beatles with Pete Best at The Cavern Club as well as their American debut on The Ed Sullivan show, along with other great clips including the unseen video for Strawberry Fields.Also contains great interviews with the people closest to the band, including producer George Martin who sheds the most insight on what the Beatles really went through, plus footage of Beatles manager Brian Epstein.This is best documentary next to Anthology and the audio is as good as a VHS can produce. Hopefully one day someone will distribute this great piece on DVD.Buy this tape, you won't be disappointed."
3,"So Paul might be dead, whatever, but...","... judging by this film Cynthia Lennon never existed. :) This is a fairly accurate version of the history of the Beatles with the ususal inaccurate myths. However, it is a quick and entertaining lesson in The Beatles. Much better than some of the trash that's out there.If you'd rather have an in depth look, buy the Anthology."
5,Pre Anthology Beatles 101,"In June 1986 when I was 15 years old,USA network aired The Compleat Beatles (albiet truncated).Although only having limited knowledge of the group,I taped it, and played it nonstop,ending the year recieving for Christmas""The Beatles Collection"" containing their albums in their original UK pressings(on Vinyl and before the first CD releases).Nearly a quarter of a century later, and the longer more comprehensive Beatles Anthology (1995)being the superior successor,""Compleat"" is still essential,especially for those who want a speedier trip through the history of the Beatles.Even without the group being interviewed,Producer George Martin gives an insightful look at the group and how they evolved from Moptops to the great artist we know and love today.Unfortunately out of print and never seen a DVD release,despite being an essential look at the history of the greatest group ever,especially for the short attention spanned"
5,DVD PLEASE!!!!!!,"I just blew the dust off this VHS, havent watched it in years....Now that the 40th anniversary has passed I thought I would watch it, glad I did, forgot how good this film is.... great insight to how all there songs were created, George Martin explains in detail how the songs came about, who wrote what, who sang on which song.... very good. Too bad the Beatles didnt participate in this film for interviews sake that is....would have been a nice touch to have them there telling there stories of how things really went. Guess the anthology series does that.... cant wait for the DVD of this .... will buy in a heartbeat...maybe they will add more material on the DVD..."
3,Good video but not all correct,"if it was more accurate I would give it more stars, though it is entertaining"
4,This book was helpful to me.,"I worked as a staff pharmacist in a retail pharmacy for 7 years. After taking a new job in a long term care pharmacy, I found myself needing a review of IV therapy. I bought this book and it was helpful to me as I transitioned into a more clinical position."
5,IV Therapy Made Incredibly Easy,"This book was written plainly, with cute association tips, weather your a pro at getting an IV into a site, or just coming into the field, this book will be helpful to both sides of the coin. and it has it's funny side to it, brought a couple of chuckles to me as I was reading it."
5,IVs made incredibly easy,I found this book to be incredibly valuable. I recently used this book as a resource to teach an IV class at our hospital. I would highly recommend this book for every nurse.
1,"Book is great, but amazon needs to be updated to state it's SPANISH","As other reviewer wrote, book is actually very good, and I had assumed this was a part two of a book I'd enjoyed, not so much, it's in Spanish. Even though Amazon site specifically states ""Product Language: English"" or the equivalent."
4,Buy this *and* catch the show,"After hearing these guys live in Houston, I had to get the album. The album is good - no disappointment here. Standout songs include ""Played the Fool"" with its riff loosely reminiscent of Expressway (To Your Heart), and ""Memphis"" with its lovely vocal harmony.In addition to owning the album, one *must* see them live. They put on a fine show. They did a really great cover of ""Shaky Ground"" à la Delbert McClinton that reminded me how much I love that song. A moving cover of ""Against My Will"" (written by the late Stephen Bruton) helped make a pleasant mix for the final set. The original material fit well with the selected covers. The band is solid, and John Gaar is a fine guitar player. This album gives a good feel for the type of music to expect, but Gaar and his Hopeful Souls have much more to offer."
3,Solid blues rock,"I found this one at quite a discount from the price you see here, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice hard rocking collection of all original material. Out of Louisiana, but definitely has a Texas feel, (think SRV) Gaar definitely has the skill and passion to stand with anybody. The vocals are fine, more earnest then moving, and there is an intrusive organ, but overall it was a fun listen and I bet this guy rips it up live."
2,"It's a battery, not a generator","The Xanex ""Generator"" isn't a generator at all; it's a small rechargeable battery combined with a lamp and one of those cheesy little battery powered tire pumps that sometimes come in roadside emergency kits. In other words it's a collection of cheesy tools at a premium price.If you want a real generator, get a Honda, but be prepared to spend three times as much. And if you want a portable battery/charger package for running accessories and emergency car starting, there are better units."
1,never worked but they replaced it,"We had the problem noted below but the mfg. did the right thing and replaced it. Terrific and appreciate integrity.We charged it immediately and put it away for our first power failure that didn't happened until last night (almost a year after buying it). It didn't work. One of the fluorescent tubes lit but it wouldn't take a very small LCD TV.And we can't figure out how to contact Amazon about taking it back or exchanging it.Very disappointing from two aspects: (1) it never worked, and (2) Amazon doesn't seem to have any way to contact them about it so they can attempt to replace it."
4,Good overall; takes a long time to charge,"Overall, I am pleased with this product. However, I ran into the same issues addressed by Ron Campbell in his review. Although the manual states it takes about 40 hours to recharge using the AC adapter (plus an additional 15 hours if you don't see the green light after 40 hours), it took more like 72 hours before I got the green light indicating full charge. The owner's manual states that longer charge times are indicative of less than 120 volts at the wall outlet. I find it hard to believe that my three-year-old house does not have 120 volts at the outlets, but I guess that is possible.I bought this to use as an emergency jump-start unit and to add air to my tires after they are deflated for offroad travel. It seems to suit my needs. I would recommend this product, but be aware that the charge times may take twice as long as those stated by the manufacturer."
4,Great value battery/jump start device - too bad not in stock anymore!,"I bought one of these from Amazon and have been very impressed so far. The major success was that it started my dead car twice on one charge. In addition, I've used it to listen to AC boomboxes, play gameboy, power small devices. The air compressor seems a bit feeble, but does come with a handy stash of nozzles.This thing has 20 AH batteries (probably 2 6volt replaceable-when-dead sealed batteries). The inverter is rated at 250watts (300 starting/surge watts). Remember WATTS = Volts x Amps, so you can easily run a laptop or a radio, but not a nice big color TV. Most devices tell you either their amps or their watts. You can burn an inverter by plugging to great a load into it."
4,Calling all Austen Fans,"Charming three short novellas/pieces of writings from Lady Austen. Her humorous side is quite apparent here and her characters, are very believable.The first novella, Lesley Castle, is told entirely in letters. Think chick lit of Austen's century, think cabot and her novels (like the guy next door, written in email form). You'll laugh at the obvious exaggeration in some parts, and giggle helplessly at the turn of events.Then comes 'A History of England', Austen's take on another historical book. This parody would surely give you a glimpse of the author's sense of humour and you might even side with her when she attacks Queen Lizzie.The last novella, Catharine, was entertaining, humorous and light.Any Austen fan should read this!"
4,Good and practical,Needed a night stand for the nursery. This matched my set from CostCo perfectly and is pretty decent for this type of use. I wouldn't put it in a master bedroom but is good for what I have purchased it for and it was fairly inexpensive.
2,Missing Scene,"A whole series of shots seems to be missing: the baseball game, paying for the ice cream with diamonds, the trip to the Lincoln Memorial. ????? Otherwise, a fabulous DVD. High quality and good extras."
4,A Thinking Person's Movie,"A superior being from outer space comes to earth, and of course we, instead of waiting to see what his intentions are, we shoot first, then we ask questions. Next we find a semi-friendly alien, with a message, ""You are a violent people."" A message we long to understand. Comply as peaceful people, or be destroyed.But we no like being told we must give up our violent ways. DUHH! A very good movie worth the price, if just for the fun of it."
4,One of the best for the time period,"It's been some time since I've seen it but this is one of the better 50's sci-fi movies. Some of the science may be weak( movies still do that) and some of the dialogue as well (Frances Bavier talking about THEM, meaning the Soviets is an example) but this is a generally well thought out and developed movie. I liked the way people responded to Klaatu's appearance on Earth and the warning he gave about our atomic weapons programs. The demonstration of power by stopping just about everything on Earth but Hospitals and aircraft in flight (the Earth stood still)was quite a way to get everyone's attention, that and correcting the mistake in the Professor's formula were nice touches. Considering what was probably a low budget those guys did very well indeed, where are they when we need them now?"
4,Welcome to the United Nations,"Ah, the good old days when movies did NOT have today's three-fold magic formula of sex scenes, attacks on biblical religion, and outright perversion. My kids saw it with me, as it was something today's adult films hardly ever are--clean. I mean this was 1951, right?I really enjoyed this film until the end. Like ""The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming"", this turned out to be a political film. But I didn't realize that until the UN speech that the space man gave at the end. A really good film turned into a ""no, not this again"" film in the last couple of minutes. So I rated this four stars instead of five.Sorry, folks, I like my national sovereignty, and this film attacks it.By the way, it did show me something we're still arguing about--how big cars should be. Cars back then were the size of minivans now, while today's cars are smaller than they were decades ago. So I won't feel guilty driving something big, especially with child restraint laws on the books."
4,Fabulous . . . almost!,THE must have classic sci-fi movie. Great story with real characters. The only problem with the DVD version is that it is not available in widescreen format . . . a real shame for such a classic picture
5,Great Transfer and Great Movie,"I could not be happier with the blu-ray transfer of this Sci-Fi classic. When buying this blu-ray, I considered the alternative of buying the newer version, which includes the original as an add-on, but thought to myself ""When am I going to watch the new garbage version?"" I think I made the right decision and I hope you will to. Five stars for quality of transfer, Five for quality of film. Great buy."
5,Scared me as a kid when it first came out. Still has impact.,"A true ""cold war"" look at earthlings! It remains a beautifully paced and acted film. The fellow from Philadelphia, the one who wrote all in caps - is wrong. The film was made in 1951 and photographed in the standard academy ratio of 1.37:1. Also his ""shouting"" review (using caps is tantamount to doing that) is annoying. Get your facts right and learn some internet etiquette sir."
4,The foundation for all SciFi that follows....,This was the first science fiction movie I ever saw and it forever captured my fascination with the genre. It may be too subtle for children but it delivers a message that earth has not as yet taken to heed. Keep trying Klaatu!
5,"Fifty years later, still great.","Naturally, there are some flaws; I believe the radio announcer says the radar target (Klaatu's spaceship) is travelling ""at the incredible speed of twelve hundred miles per hour"" or something like that. I think test pilots had already cracked Mach 2 by that time, so 1,200 MPH was hardly incredible. And later, Klaatu gives the location of his planet as being something like 30 or 50 million miles away -- that could only be Venus or Mars, not a likely origin. But those are minor quibbles. Rennie's performance is great; I especially like the wry smiles when he observes what is, to him, the childlike or childish behavior of earthlings. But my favorite part of the movie is the scene of the spacecraft landing in Washington. Outstanding special effects! Everyone gets hung up on the Cold War overtones of the movie. Forget that and just enjoy a great science fiction yarn."
5,SCI FI at it's Best,"One of the best early (never againg! ) movies in the sci-fi genre and in showing man's fear (and consequences) and reaction to the unknown. Who could possibly forget Gort--the huge robot (policeman) built to cause total destruction when forced to retaliate. Or the words, Klatu, Barada, Nikto that have lived on for many sci-fi generations. This movie definitely falls in the five star category and one that should be considered for updating for the movie screens!"
2,"great movie, bad DVD","It is a great movie, but the DVD is so disapointing. Fox releases a single-layer flipper in 2003! All the two sides of the movie could be easily put in a dual-layer dvd. I really don't understand why the studio did like this. Make no sense in 2003!"
3,A well done fake of a wonderful story,"The production is a product of the times. The studio couldn't see telling you the REAL story as written, so they FAKED the ENDING to ruin all the meaning the author intended. The movie is inferior to others around at that time by being hyper. The 3 stars are for the production--but it should be -10 for the ending. If you really care, find a copy and read it BEFORE watching the movie and THEN decide how you feel about it."
2,This movie was not worth the money!,"I am shocked as to how bad this movie was. No guts to it; just smoke and whistles. I hope Hollywood will get on board with better movies. The only good thing about the blue ray edition, it came with the original black and white movie and a digital copy to load on your PC."
2,"Read the story--movie is a[n] [imitation] with ""Hollywood"" ending","This movie MIGHT have been a ""classic"" except for one thing. Read the story and then NOTE THE ENDING. I won't tell you to protect the ones who care enough to read it. However the producers thought the audience wouldn't ""like"" the book's true ending, so they changed it. Not bad enough, but the real problem is THE CHANGE COMPLETELY ALTERED THE ENTIRE STORY, AND DESTROYED THE WRITER'S MEANING. IT IS ONE OF THE WORST DISTORTIONS IN SCI-FI HISTORY. Watch if you will, (well done for the times) but know that it is in the class of the old Westerns--a thriller, but that is all."
2,Journey to the Center Of The Earth,The movie would be great except you need 3D glasses to watch it which of course should have come with it and didn't.So it is the drawer untouched.
2,Older isn't Better,"There seems to be a perception that classic cinema is better. I disagree. There are great movies from the early days of film (The Phantom of the Opera) to the most recent days. This film, however, isn't one of them. The Day the Earth Stood Still might have been though provoking in its time, but it remains a movie relevant to its time with more of a historical interest than a timeless classic. Not to mention the wooden acting and the dated effects. At least a tenth of the film could have been edited out without changing the story or the message. Not that the message that humans need to be more responsible is either new or riveting."
5,Sci-Fi At Its Best,"It has been at least fifty years and I remembered every scene! This film remains a classic that defines the genre.Although immersed in the paranoia of the Fifties, the spaceman and the robot remain timeless. The spaceman comes through as an empathetic but unsympathetic alien with a message to deliver. He is unswayed by the current political climate and refuses to take sides in our ""irrelevent conflicts."" The character of Gort, the robot manages to convey menace without uttering a sound and being imobile throughout most of the film. A mere turn of the robot's head was enough to cause me to run for cover. Yet it is shown to be an intelligent and complex being.Throughout, the story relies little on special effects. Even the spaceship is spartan with virtually none of the ever present knobs and dials we are used to seeing in an alien craft.This should be on everyone's Must Have list."
5,Blu-ray is GO!,"This looks great. I hope it sells like hot cakes. We need to support releases like this!My only quibble is the cover art. It's not bad, but I would have preferred original vintage poster art.Don't forget to tap your zoom button during the photo gallery section. Those small pics look great blown up."
5,Sci Fic Review,"The Day the Earth Stood Still, is one of the originals Science Fiction Movies of the 1950, with It Came from Outer Space andWar of the Worlds being the other two. This movie is very good.I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in sciencefiction, or is collecting science fiction movies, that have notbeen remade. I would recommend this movie to all."
4,Great for its time,"I just watched this version and the 2008 remake back-to-back and was curious to determine which one was better. I'll have to go with the 2008 version because this 1951 version is so dated by comparison. Although Michael Rennie as Klaatu is arguably superior to Keanu Reeves, I like the fish-our-of-water approach Reeves took, sort of Spock-like. Basically, the 2008 version took everything about this version and made it better: color, drama, f/x, Gort, the Christian typology and the spectacular apocalyptic climax.That said, this '51 version was great for its time and is definitely worthy of one's video library. It has a nice eerie 50's sci-fi score.Some parts of this version are just lame and boring, but I found it interesting to see how the USA was back in 1950, the way people dressed and talked, etc. Other than that, though, the 2008 version is leagues superior in every conceivable way. Unless your thoroughly tainted by nostalgia, it's the simple truth."
4,Enjoyment,I was captured the moment I pushed play. This is my simple review. It was a great movie with amazing effects. The characters themselves were memorable and that in itself makes a movie enjoyable.
5,The first and the best,"Eversince I was a small child and saw this, the original, I have always enjoyed watching it again and again. It's in black and white; you get to use some of your imgination"
5,Sci - Fi classic,"never saw this one in the movie hall, but watch it a lot now that i am retired and have time"
5,To bad Gort doesn't work at the UN.,"I'm sure we would have gotten rid of Saddam along time ago. But that's another story for another time,,,,,i digress.This movie proves that you don't need computer generated effects and million dollar budgets to make a great motion picture as this. Actors back then knew how to act. The combination of Patricia and Michael says it all. Just look at their facial expressions during some of these tense scenes. This is a great motion sci-fi movie that still holds up to anything in this 21st century. The THX re-mix is great especially on a THX system. This is an extremely powerful movie that does make you wonder if........"
4,SciFi Classic,This is a wonderful classic and Michael Rennie who plays the Alien is the kind of guy that girls get a crush on with each new generation. It is pretty corny compared to today's technology but the message still holds true and the actors do a good job of putting it across. Very much worth watching.
2,"great movie, bad DVD","It is a great movie, but the DVD is so disapointing. Fox releases a single-layer flipper in 2003! All the two sidesof the movie could be put in one side with dual layer. I really don't understand why the studio did like this. Make no sense in 2003!"
4,OK THIS IS GOOD JUST LIKE I SAW IT ON TV WITH MORE !,JUST LIKE KLA-TU I HATE STUPED JUNK BUT THIS DVD IS NOT ONE OF THEM IF YOU LIKE THE MOVIE AS A KID MAYBE WANT TO SHARE IT WITH YOUR KID GET IT !KAL-TU BA-RA-DA NECT-TU GORT !
2,Mildly Entertaining,"This is a science fiction film that is moderately good at times.It was made in the early 1950s so the technology, special effects, etc. are minimal. That is understandable.The story itself is more problematic. It is basically propaganda camouflaged as entertainment. The gist of the story is about an alien from another planet, Klaatu (Michael Rennie) who comes to Earth along with his robot Gort (Lock Martin) to threatent Earthlings with their extinction if they continue along their 'warlike path'. There is a scene with Klaatu that is an allegory of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That is rather tasteless especially considering that the message delivered is one of death threats in complete contrast to the message of love and life given by Jesus. The basic message of the interplanetary traveler is: 'be peaceful or we'll kill you'.If not for the questionable messages given, this might be considered a pretty good movie from that period of time. As it is, I do not recommend it."
5,All time best SF movie,I just recently watched this terrific DVD at a friend's home.It has been years since I have seen this movie classic and what a treat this viewing has been. I forgot what a great movie this was. I am definitely adding this DVD to my collection and I vote it the all time best SF movie
4,Only one thing was missing,"As I have looked on the extras, only one thing was missing. Did you know that TDTESS was also a LUX radio production. I caught this years ago on SCIFI.com's Seeing Ear Theater. It would have been neat to see that included as an audio extra like the Vault Disney DVD's had done with Old Yeller, Swiss Family Robinson and Pollyanna. They have audio tracks of the story books, commercials , etc. This isn't a complaint just a wish for a truly rare extra. I'm just so glad its on DVD with Robert Wise and Nicolas Meyer doing commentary. Mr. Wise now really has a chance for making sure his thoughts and recollections are preserved for posterity as Star Trek TMP directors cut did. I hope he gets to do this for Sand Pebbles and Sound of Music before this great man passes on."
5,One of the best cold war sci fi movies ever made,"One of my all time favorite movies, cold war era film with potent messages and warning concerning the behaviour of mankind, seems now tha we did not listen! Gort where art thou? lol"
5,day the earth stood still 1951,original is still the best. it was sacrilege to do a remakedo yourself a favor and watch this...just the best
4,Corny but fun,"Just like most of the 1950's classic black and white ""monster"" movies, this one is just as corny and ""mild"" compared to todays standards, but it's great fun. The acting is really pretty good - you find yourself drawn right into that boarding house where Bobby and his mother live (ok now her character name escapes me, but it's Patricia Neal)....and of course Gort standing guard at the spaceship does a tremendous job of making you feel like there is no way under the sun you're walking up that ramp towards the spaceship! (and he doesn't speak one single word) One blink of his super-duper evaporating x-ray and that's all it would take to convince me to get out of Dodge. Great fun - great for the family, and a must for your classic movie collection."
4,Incorrect description of movie,I purchased this product according to the writeup Amazon had on the Internet saying this film was in color. It is not in color but the B&W version is spectacular. Just wanted everyone to know that the movie is not in color. Thank you.
5,Hooked on Sci-fi,I have always wanted to own this movie since I saw it on tv in the 50's(when it was new.) It was one of the movies that got me hooked on sci-fi.
4,The Day the Earth Stood Still,It's an old favorite of mine that I still enjoy watching. My son who is 26 also liked the movie.
1,ANOTHER FAILED REMAKE,"BORING, LOOSE ENDS, PREACHY IN THE EXTREME (I HATE HAVING HOLLYWOOD PREACH TO ME ABOUT THINGS OF WHICH THEY KNOW NOTHING), MISSED THE WHOLE THREAD OF THE ORIGINAL."
1,Ripoff!,Why issue a Blu-Ray version that is not in 16-9 format? This is no different than watching my old copy on my 1080P set. They cleverly state the aspect ratio as 1.33:1 which is the same as 4:3. When I ordered it I thought that was a mistake. Shame! We have been deceived!
3,Black and White only colectors. Not colorized.,"I bought the blu-ray version of the original and was not too impressed.I did give it a 3 out of 5 rating, for the effort. They should of included the colorized version along with the bloopers and any other colectibles.The blu-ray version has nothing other than better black and white picture clarity. It was not really remastered, which is what blu-ray collectors have come to expect! Perhaps when they release the new movie on blu-ray they will include a COLORIZED REMASTERED version of the original. The movie studio really let us video collectors down on this one. Oh, and for those who like the original in B&W; - there still are VHS tapes out there! The younger minded generation wants and demands great color at 1080P or better when they fork over the additional funds for blu-ray movies."
1,The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Amazon advertized this dvd as a new release,being released on december 2nd,this is the old movie,still in black and white. i recieved it on december 1st so how could it be a new release coming out on dec.2nd? I feel this was a false advertizement. i have ordered several other dvd's off amazon and i will cancel all those purchases.I thought Amazon would do better than this. I'm very disappointed."
5,The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951),"Your kidding...this was much better film then the 2008 one. Great picture, Great story. Not people being wiped out all over. Nothing but killing ,and more killing and sex and Nudity today. But back in the 50's and 60's .. that was My time.You understood the meaning of this film with out all that.And I guess that dosen't sell anymore. To bad."
4,bjohnson1224@gmail.com,Shipping was fast and the merchandise was in perfect shape. No glitches with the movie disc. In fact I saw the movie when it was the the theater and the quality of the disc was better than the original.
5,The Day the Earth Stood Still,"finally, we have probably the best space sci-fi movie ever made. It is one of our favorites, and although it is somewhat dated in its special effects the story line is still one of the most plausable to date. We have seen the remake with Keanu Reeves, but you just can't beat the original."
3,Classic Sci-Fi!!!,"I watched this last night for the first time because the remake is coming out tomorrow and I wanted to see the differences between them. This has a pretty good storyline. I love how it has the classic look and feel of a 50's movie! A flying saucer lands in Washington D.C. and two people come out. An alien in human form named Klaatu, and a strong robot named Gort. Klaatu warns people to stop fighting and having wars or the earth will be destroyed. If you love classic sci-fi films, you'll love THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL!!!"
5,Cult classic!!!,One of the best early sci-fi movies ever made. A must for that movie collector. Get your copy now!!
5,One of the first -- and spookiest -- SciFi Flics of the 50's,"This is one of the earliest, spookiest and best-executed science fiction films of the 1950s. It's an A-production, released by a major studio (Twentieth Century Fox), with an A-list cast (Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Billy Gray, and everyone's favorite ""Aunt Bea,"" Miss Frances Bavier). It was directed by the soon-to-be-great Robert Wise (of ""The Sound of Music"" fame). The on-location filming in the Washington, D.C. of 1950 is fascinating to watch. It's also a pleasant and bittersweet reminder of the days when the worst thing those of us living in and near Washington had to worry about was a space ship landing on the elipse!"
3,"Durable, Light, Compact","I like this flashlight. It is definitely compact (I keep it in my backpack 24/7), extremely durable (dropped it quite a few times on concrete and it never phased it), lightweight and pretty bright for its size. However, I was expecting it to be a bit brighter. I suppose I was hoping for something taht would light up an entire corridor versus an area.It is definitely functional, especially with its 3 different types of lights, and I use it all the time when I do not have light."
2,just ok!,this light is not all what it claims to be! it is ok as a spare one but not as your only small light.
5,Very Pleasantly Surprised!!,"Upon browsing through the library, looking for something new with ""substance,"" the beauty of the cover on Legacy Lane caught my eye. Glancing through it, I thought it might be a little too bland. It turned out, however, to be a book that I've since recommended to many friends. Yes, it was predictable -- but isn't that refreshing in today's world? There's no complex sub-plot, no violence, no intrigue ... just a plain, uncomplicated, enjoyable story -- with a happy ending!! It really draws you into a peaceful place, and you feel surrounded by genuinely good, God-loving people. At the end, you just wish your ""visit"" could have lasted longer."
3,Typical Robin Hatcher,"I've read a number of Hatcher's books from my own church library as well as Kindle books. She is highly rated for a Christian author. Her books are very Christian. There's just not really any meat to her stories. You know the ending by the time you've finished half the first chapter...if not before. Most of the ""Christian"" scenes...i.e. dialogue, conversations, etc. are just not realistic. I've been a born-again believer for 60 years and I've never met anyone who actually lives, acts and talks this way in their every day life. BUT, it you want a nice clean Christian fiction book, she's the gal for you."
4,Legacy,Enjoyed the book. The characters were real life. Story reminded me of home town. Anxious to read to next two of the Series.
1,It wasn't for me,I guess I got this book before it was reviewed. I had no idea it was a religious book. I don't normally mind an understated religious book but this one just had too much in it for me. I just didn't care for it at all and did not even finish it.
3,Formulaic but enjoyable,"There are no twists or turns or surprises, it is exactly what you expect and unfolds exactly as you would expect. I would read more in this series or other series by this author, but it is what it is, a trip down a familiar road is not necessarily an unpleasant experience. It is very Christian in nature. If you don't want that, don't read this."
4,Delightful read,"This was a nice fast book to read. I couldn't put it down. I thought I'd have a little read after I downloaded it then read the rest later, but I couldn't stop. I liked the ending. It was very preachy throughout which was grating and I didn't think the relationship between the mother and daughter was realistic - it was in the beginning but not the end."
2,a repeat?,"This second book in the series is such a repeat of the first one I thought I may have mixed things up. I hadn't and except for a few changes I really felt it was a reread. Still sweet, but lets have some interaction with previous characters or something to mix things up a little."
1,bad movie,this movie sucked!some friends told me to watch it so I did. I couldnt even set threw this hole thing!
1,not so universal,description makes it seem like it fits most stoves...I have a Whirlpool--doesn't fit. Perhaps a better picture would help. The larger size I ordered of the same item is shipping separately-will now have to process yet another return.
4,Evans comes out hitting a homerun,"Robert Evans was behind a bunch of hollywood masterpieces such as Chinatown, The Marathon Man, Rosemary's Baby and The Godfather (just to name a few) and why he was involved with Popeye I have no clue. He must of been looney. Evans had a wife and child but he was divorced. He did drugs, got into the wrong things, lots of sex and he payed the price for the after math. He was friends with some of the greatest actors, directors and actresses of our time: Jack Nicholson, Mia Farrow, Roman Polanski, James Cagney, Dustin Hoffman and many more I honestly thought this was a good documentary about life in the hollywood eye. My favorite part is during the credits when Dustin Hoffman does the impersonation of Evans, that's a classic right there. If your interested, watch it and if your not, watch it once and then dont."
5,Excellent!,"So I've read the book and heard the audio, and yes, this movie is just a short synopsis of the whole story of Robert Evans, but I have never seen a biography done with such panache. The style, the soundtrack, the stories, were fascinating. I highly recommend this movie."
1,Poor packaging,"When I first opened the package, I was surprised to see The Kid Stays in The Picture was in a clear plastic case when my past copy had been in a older model cardboard set up with the plastic casing. The actual cover's edges were cut off by more than a 1/4 of an inch and the back part has a scalloped edging.My first thought was boot leg and was worried the DVD wouldn't play right, which it did. Still, I question the seller of this product and will never purchase from them again. I don't condone repackaging or boot leg DVDs and would return it if the cost of shipping it wasn't more than the actual dvd."
1,and the point is???????,I just didn't get it. The movie was painfully boring. The only remotely redeeming aspect was some interesting cinematography.
5,myspace.com/barropanama,"always loved this one, one of the best made documentaries ever... and all that hollywood glamour that i love... Jack Nocholson is the man! youll see why... i wonder what s Evans doing now... besides screwing"
4,Susan Goes Back to College,"Susan Henshaw decides to go back to college after her children leave home. She is nervous about the prospect of returning to the academic life and trying to relate to 18-22-year-olds. She goes through the usual pangs of attending class and taking tests, but the real problems begin when her lab partner is murdered with Susan's backpack. Of course, suspicion centers on Susan, so she has to investigate the murder in self defense. She discovers that the murder victim had meddled in many people's lives and that several people might have a motive to murder her. Her semester of work parallels her investigation, and as finals approach, Susan zeroes in on the murderer. This book is recommended reading for ""cozy"" fans."
4,SUSAN HENSHAW GETS AN A IN MURDER,"When Susan Henshaw suburban mom goes back to school, she finds murder instead.Every Valerie Wolzien novel is fun to read and the plots easy to follow. For long time fans the addition of two new characters will be something to cheer for. New readers to the series will want to go back to the beginning and follow Susan through her adventures from PTA soccer mom to Mother of the Bride and now college student."
2,Great until washed.,"I like the large capacity and my coffee was kept hot longer than I expected. The top fits snugly and the wide bottom assures I won't knock it over.As suggested, I prewashed the mug with warm soapy water just before use. I did not notice until the after-use washing that it leaked quite a bit between the metal insert and the outer plastic covering. I am disappointed."
5,Easy Hymn Fake Book,"Totally enjoy this fake book. The various hymns it contains give me more than enough selections.I use this often, both at home and for other events I play at."
5,It's Great!,"PRETTY IN PINK is one of my favorite movies. It combines love, comedy and relationships w/ both friends and family. Not only is Molly Ringwald a great actress, but there's Duckie too! He's halarious. Though I think the original ending would be more suitable (Andy ending up with Duckie rather than Blair), it still is a fabulous movie. I love it!"
4,"The Weakest Of The John Hughes Teen Comedies, But Still Very Good.","Though not as good as ""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Weird Scienece"" or ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""Pretty In Pink"", like all the John Hughes produced 1980s' teen classics, is a highly enjoyable teen romp.Molly Ringwald, Hughes' muse for these movies, plays Andie Walsh, a smart hiugh schooler who lives with her deadbeat dad (the always wonderful Harry Dean Stanton) and is generally in the company of her friends, namely the carefree Duckie (Jon Cryer in a classic performance). Pining for Andy's affection is Blane McDonnagh, a rich and very popular student who wants to take Andie to the prom. This does not sit well with Duckie, who's harboured a secret crush on Andie since he's known her. Backstabbing, lies, and heartache ensues, but it leads up to a great conclusion.""Pretty In Pink"" is not as good as its predecessor, but it's still a very solid and entertaining teen comedy."
3,Overrated,This was an okay movie. The soundtrack is much better than the movie. One reason to watch the movie is to listen for the songs that are on the soundtrack. I can't stand Blaine. I don't know why she would end up with him and not Duckie. The ending is not realistic.
3,Ducky saves the day!,"Pretty in Pink is not as good as The Breakfast Club or Sixteen Candles from the John Hughes/Molly Ringwald collection. John Cryer as lovable and daffy Ducky keeps this '80s film above float. Cute concept but nothing much to make you want to run out and buy this movie. I heard the original ending of the film was Ringland's character was supposed to end up with Ducky and not Andy McCarthy's stuffy rich boy character. Wringland objected to this and the ending was changed while filming, shame on you Molly, Andie belonged with Ducky, oh well Pretty in Pink is a classic but I would buy her other two brat pack films instead."
5,Cult Classic!~,Cult classic from the 80's all teenagers should see. Molly Ringwold ....Duckie just a cute movie Brat pack movie .......Fun to watch!~
4,"Alternate Ending is ""Behind the Scenes"" - not a REAL Scene","I am a HUGE fan of Pretty in Pink. So of course I was uber excited to see the ""alternate ending"" where Andy ends up with Duckie! However, I was somewhat disappointed in that piece from this DVD. It is actually the director and actors talking through the behind the scene filming where you simply see Molly Ringwald and Jon Cryer standing at prom holding hands with the cameras and microphones swirling around them. They repeat these images numerous times while there is commentary to fill the visual space. It was a disappointment as I expected to see an actual scene acted out with the characters. If you expect the same, don't. Otherwise, this is a great DVD to own if you love this movie!"
5,Great Movie With An Awesome Cast,"The first time I saw this movie I fell inlove with all the great charcters. Andrew McCarthy, Molly Ringwald, Annie Potts & ""Ducky"". This is a story of a high school where money doesn't mix with anything else but more money. Molly Ringwald plays a teenager whose father hasn't been inspired to excel since her mother left them years ago. They live a simple lifestyle on the wrong side of the tracks. Andrew McCarthy is the boy who has everything, except true classy friends, although they have tons of money. When he falls for Ringwald he has to face those who begin to snob him. But he's not the only one getting heat......Ringwald's best friend, Ducky, happens to be very much in love with her and fights with all he has, which isn't much, to win her for his future bride. Ringwald works in a record store where she'll get the best advice Annie Potts has ever offered up. This movie is funny, sad and inspiriational. If you like romantic comedy, you'll love this one."
4,One heck of a good film!!!,"This is one of my favorite 80's movies. The best scene is when Duckie is laying on his bed listening to The Smiths. (and if you watch in the record store you see a Smiths record too!)But enough of that.It's a good,fun movie with good music (New Order) in it and cool clothes."
3,"opposites may attract, but they don't last long","when i saw this movie in 1991, i fell in love with it, because as a free spirit/outcast, i could relate to molly's character and the plight she goes through being different...i still like the movie, but i guess since i've become analytical, i have a habit of dissecting things...in the real world, the geeky girl or guy doesn't get the beautiful one. maybe on another planet , but not here...and while people tell us they admire originality, they really want people to be more like them...in a way, the columbine tragedy was the best thing that ever happened to america because it forced people to see the marginalized as people, and they learned that the freaks do matter and shouldn't be dissed... one stars for the performances, one star for the cool psychedelic furs song, and one star for the people who don't want to fit in...."
4,P.I.P.,"Pretty in pink - classic 80's, feel-good movie. It's not as good as Sixteen Candles but good and classic nonetheless."
3,Update on Special-Everithing Duckie Edition (Features),"Bare in mind that there's currently 2 ""Pretty in Pink"" (DVD)'s out there in the market: -the 2002 DVD release (w/-orig.art work), & 2006's ""Everything Duckie Edition"". This review relates to the latter. I've been reading in most blogs and review for this DVD that it doesn't have or comes with any Special Features? If you purchase the 2006 ""Everything Duckie Edition"" it does indeed come with:Audio Commentary from Director: Howard Deutch and includes Featurettes:1. ""The First Time: The Making of Pretty in Pink""2. ""Zoids and Richies""3. ""Prom Queen: All About Molly""4. ""Volcanic Ensembles""5. ""Prom Stories""6. ""The Lost Dance: The Original Ending""7. ""Wrap Up: The Epilogue""Text/Photo Galleries:Photo Gallery:Unlike the 2002 DVD which only featured the movie and nothing else."
5,Pretty Awesome: Another Molly classic,"This was classic 80's style teen angst from 1986. Molly Ringwald shines as Andie, an avant-garde teen who styles her own clothes and has a constant battle with the popular crowd. Enter Blane the prep and her best friend Duckie, love triangle and high school clique politics. Molly captures the era well in this tale of love from the wrong side of the tracks."
2,5 stars for item; 2 for more corporate scuminess,We saw this on the shelf at a Target a few weeks back. Save your money if you already have the collector's edition; this is just the old edition w/a CD of '80s music.
3,Well.....,"I actually give this movie 2.5 stars, but I'll be generous and round that up to three.Overall, this movie was average. It was somewhat enjoyable, and rather interesting. However, there, of course, was one major problem. And that was the ending. I'm not going to ruin it for anyone (if you've seen it, you know what I am talking about), but I really felt cheated, and it made me want to vomit. See it and you'll know what I mean (unless you're stuck-up and/or heartless).But it's worth watching just for Duckie. Go Duckie!"
3,Sitting Duck,"This film is disappointing in that the whole film forshadows Molly's ""inevitable fall"" for Duckie, but then lets you down by having Mr. D-Bag come along and steal her away...I mean, wtf??? What happened to poetic justice? It appears the original film did have the two get together; was this this the theatrical version? Great soundtrack, though (hope the editors didn't mess with that, too)and overall the movie is ""pretty"" good.Leave the classics alone!!!"
4,"GOOD MOVIE, GREAT MUSIC",LET'S JUST SAY I LOVE MOLLY RINGWALD! GREAT ACTING ON EVERYONE'S PART. THIS A VERY CUTE STORY.
1,pretty in pink,I have contacted the seller 2 times to return this item. (Bought 2 by mistake. My fault. )Once in December after receiving item and one 2 weeks later. Now its getting too late to return item. The seller has not contacted me. Will never buy from this seller again.
2,Brat Pack classic.... but not much more.,"Pretty in Pink is your basic ugly duckling story without much else.... other than a screaming view of early 80's fashion. James Spader's performance as the detestable ringleader of the ""cool kids"" gives a sneak peak of his future repeat performances as detestable characters (see: Boston Legal, Secretary, etc.). Andrew Shue is as irritating as ever with his wide-eyed ""innocence"" and pursed lips which are, apparently, meant to indicate internal self-flagellation during his less-than-sensitive moments. Annie Potts and John Cryer give the only two performances without reproach (and Duckie's famous dance to ""Try a Little Tenderness"" is not to be missed)but are, sadly, relegated to second-tier characters. This film isn't even up to par with the other Brat Pack films as far as storyline and character development (which isn't saying much!), but, in the end, at least you'll get a chuckle out of Andie's pink polka-dot atrocity."
4,Pretty good 80's movie,"This isn't really my favorite movie that John Hughes made, Sixteen Candles is my favorite, but this one is also pretty good..besides the ending. Molly Ringwald was SO much better with Duckie. Duckie is the best character in this, he's so funny. The part at the end when he's at the dance and he looks at you through the camera, it's priceless!! You got to check this movie out, it's a good one."
1,It really is all about the richies!,"SHAME ON PARAMOUNT! The Everything's Duckie Edition totally fails to deliver on the hype. We were cheated for the sake of false marketing! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE if you think your 20 year wait to see Duckie get the girl is about to pay off because it's not! They talk about ""the original ending"" but never show it. The richies got richer and I'm still lost looking for ""The Lost Dance""! I'm so mad I could puke on my duck shoes!"
2,No Duckie...No Way,"How can they call this Everything's Duckie if they aren't going to have the original ending on this DVD? Me and my best girlfriend bonded over the fact that we couldn't believe that Andy ran off with Blaine (Blaine, he was like the wallpaper, he was so boring) instead of being with Duckie. I tend to watch the film right up until the end and then just turn it off.When they release the film on DVD with the original ending of Andy and Duckie together, only then will I buy the DVD.The soundtrack I don't need, I have that for years. Was a big New Order long before, didn't really like Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. Left of Center (Suzanne Vega/Joe Jackson) was my life story in high school. Oh the memories."
5,AWESOME!,I BROUGHT THIS 4 MY DAUGHTER SO THAT WE BOTH COULD ENJOY THIS MOVIE 2GETHER; IT WAS OUT WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER!
4,molly rules!,"Being a guy who was a teen during the 80's, I just love this movie. One of the best coming of age movies ever made. At one time we all were cast in the ""social ladder"" and watching this movies brings back a lot of memories of the awkwardness of being a regular teen. I have always liked Molly Ringwald. As a teen I had a crush on her,(didnt all us guys?).She rules in this movie!"
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OMG, I ABOSOLUTALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE. WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS I FELL IN LOVE WITH DUCKIE, HE IS SO SWEET. IT WAS SO FUN WATCHING THIS BECAUSE IT IS THE TYPE OF MOVIE THAT IS SO EASY TO RELATE TO. I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN.YOU MIGHT BE THINKING IT WILL BE A WAIST OF YOUR TIME BECAUSE IT WAS MADE IN THE 80'S, BUT ACTUALLY, THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THEN MOST MOVIES THEY MAKE TODAY, EVEN WITH ALL THE SPECIAL EFFECTS. THIS IS ONE MOVIE I RECEMEND TO EVERYONE.L.B.S 4-LIFE"
4,a simple take,Im with many others that think she ended up with the wrong guy.. still a great movie in its own time but i woulda liked to have seen it end a little different.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:It's a John Hughes teen film starring Molly Ringwald, so you know what you're getting before you walk in: there'll be some drama, some overacting, some unmanipulative and interesting material undermined by attempts at broad humor, and an ending designed to make everyone leave with a smile on his or her face, regardless of the logical contortions required to make it happen: watch it if that appeals to you."
4,flashback,"originally this movie was actually not in my wish list but i decided to order it because with $5.00 i would get free shipping & handling, so why not?i actually started watching this movie on a bored night with my mom and i had forgotten how funny it was. i always thought sixteen candles was better than pretty in pink, but after watching it countless times i really appreciated the humor, duckie, and the horribly pink dress that molly ringwald wears to her prom."
4,"Yes, Great 80s Movie, But...","Yes, this is one of the classic teen ""coming of age"" movies of the 1980s, but for a tiny increase in price, get the newer, ""Everything's Duckie Edition"". You can find it on by searching Amazon for (ASIN):B000FZETIOThat edition has loads of DVD ""extras"", while this has almost none."
4,Classic Brat Pack,"While I wouldn't quite put this up there with 16 candles, I would say it is the equal to ""The Breakfast Club."" To make it short and sweet, if you are a fan of typical 80s movies, John Hughes films, or any members of the Brat Pack, then you will love this move."
3,80's genre,"Being a fan of Molly Ringwald, I felt it necessary to own this even though it wasn't one of her best. That dress was HORRID! But the story was cute and ended like a typical John Hughes production, i.e. lots of teenage angst. I love reliving my teen years."
3,"5 stars for the movie, 1 star for Paramount's DVD version.","5 stars for this CLASSIC '80s teen movie that pulls off something few teen movies can. It transcends the test of time.0 stars for Paramount's DVD version of this movie. Like virtually all of Paramount's backtitles (just check out their release in September of ""My Bloody Valentine,"" ""The Tenant"" or ""Don't Look Now"", they put NO SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS or EXTRAS on this DVD! What a monumental 'missing of the boat.' And what an insult to fans of this movie and DVD consumers!Clearly, Paramount doesn't have respect for its own backtitles, preferring instead to put extras mostly on new movies released on DVD. What a shame. ""Pretty in Pink"" is 16 years old. Let's see if, in another 16 years, anyone remembers the new movies that Paramount chooses to focus on."
2,Great film,"Fun to watch film, great plot with good teens, bad teens and the influence of peer pressure in high school. A real blast looking back at James Spader who starred in many great films and currently on Boston Legal and Jon Cryer currently in 2 and a half men. Both were great in their opposing sides of the track during those highly impressionable years in senior high. Regardless of the years that pass, the high school pressure is the same. Not sure what happened to Molly Ringwald or Andrew McCarthy, Annie Potts, but Spader and Cryer are on an obvious roll."
3,Pales in comparison to other Hughes/Ringwald collaborations.,"1986 brought the third of three John Hughes / Molly Ringwald movies, ""Pretty in Pink"", and I'm afraid it's the worst of the three.The storyline asks us to suspend disbelief over and over again, Molly's character seems weak and childish at times, and Jon Cryer is just annoying as the misfit ""Duckie"".I am a huge Molly Ringwald fan, but ""Pretty in Pink"" is certainly a step down from the heights of ""The Breakfast Club"" and the pinnacle of ""Sixteen Candles"".On a side note, Annie Potts is great (as usual) in a supporting role.""Pretty in Pink"" will be a necessary purchase for any 80s, Brat Pack, Hughes, or Ringwald fan, but it lacks a certain ""something"" that the other movies seem to have."
5,Pretty in Pink - one of my favorite movies,"I had been seeing this movie on tv for some time and it got to the point where I really wanted it. I wanted this version ""Pretty in Pink (Everything's Duckie Edition)"" because a reviewer said that this one had the original music. After receiving it, in great condition and before it's intended due date! I have watched it many times now, and its one of my favorites."
3,Gotta Love the Brat Pack!,"I think you know what I'm talking about. When I say Brat Pack, I'm reffering to the group of kids in THE BREAKFAST CLUB who, after the film debuted, were dubbed this title. Well, some of the brat pack are back in one of my fave Molly Ringwald movies. The plot is kinda dull (once again [as done in many films] the plot is just about a normal high school, the story separating the geeks from the popular kids, you get the picture), but with some of my favorite 80s stars in it, who CAN resist it?????"
2,didn't quite fit,didn't quite fit our oven. I used a drill to widen the holes and now it works well.One size fits some --- not ALL.
4,Feels Like A Dream,"Reading this book feels like a dream. It's kind of like poetry, but not really. It's not as funny as Little America or The Time Trip, but it never acutally claims to be... I just assumed, having read those first. It might not be full of any actual revelations, but it was interesting. If you have any curiosity about ESP, UFOs, tea leaves, coincidences, hidden meanings, doomsday cults, etc., you might like it. I read it in 2 days & enjoyed it."
5,Very informative and timely for our society today,I have read Dr. Atwood's book and was very impressed by the amount of material that she presented on this subject. My heart went out to the families whose stories were told in these pages and I could feel their anguish with having to face this situation in their lives. Thank you Dr. Atwood for opening my eyes to a very real and growing problem in today's society.
5,"A ""must read"" for every married women! Very informative!","Dr. Atwood has tackled a subject that I think many women are afraid to talk about. I appreciated her forthright honesty in dealing with the subject of husbands who are gay. After reading the book, I felt very informed on the subject! She includes lots of stories that draw you into her book, making the reading very interesting. As a married women myself, I appreciated the new insights!"
5,Good dvd,"My lil 2 year old dude loves it, it's full of music. He dances,and cracks up throughout the dvd. I'm looking forward to his next Pocoyo dvd."
4,Why? Why do babies love this so much?,"White screen, weird voice, and strange characters. And yet kids LOVE Pocoyo. I bought these for our library, to check out to parents, and they are the hottest DVD we have. They are never on the shelf.I do not get it, personally, but our patrons love these movies because their babies love these movies. One patron ruined the disk, her son had scratched it by taking the disk out of the case and trying to put in the computer repeatedly. He is not yet two and was trying to play DVD's on the computer.Dance, Pocoyo, Dance, is funny. But it is not as 'adult friendly' as the Muppets, or other children's entertainment. So get Pocoyo if you want something that toddlers and babies will watch alone, on repeat, without your intervention."
5,My 1 1/2 yr old granddaughter loves this....,My 1 1/2 yr old granddaughter cracks up watching Pocoyo...who knew?! It is quite a cute and entertaining bit of animation but the reaction she has to it is priceless! She literally is laughing hysterically. Great investment the kids will watch again and again.
3,SNOW MAN KIT,I was actually a little dissapointed with this kit. It seemed cheap and tacky. I guess I was hoping for nastalgia. The kids like it though.
2,Horrible. Do not use this book.,"I'm not so sure that any of the editors or writers themselves spell-checked ANYTHING at all in this book. In my first day of using it for my Discrete Mathematics class I found a typo (the word ""construct"" was spelled ""contruct"") as well as a confirmed error in the answers to the practice questions. This book is also terribly organized and very sparse in information. Find a different Discrete Math book if you really want to learn this subject."
4,I have to study it,"I like it, but I think there are better ways of teaching Discrete Maths. I can tell you that you discovered me the difference between Calculus and Discrete Maths. That's cool!!"
2,For Project Mgrs and Supers ?,"If you are an excavation or foundation SUB this may be quite helpful, particularly for road building. I found much of the info on ability and capacities of equipment:loaders, cranes, scrapers; concrete and aggregate production, paving, interesting but not info I need as a CM PM to build buildings in cities. If you want to know how to plan the construction of tall buildings, foundation planning, scheduling, staging, etc. don't look to this book. ""Construction Mgmt."", which touched lightly on my interest, starts on page 479 of a 550 page book. This book is simply inaccurately titled."
2,Frustration,"Freud 99-280 Recoverable Bead Glass Door Bit Set, do a beautiful job once you have zeroed in on the right settings. However doing that is a VERY difficult job, and is really frustrating. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that Freud mysteriously provides no instructions , diagrams or even any recommendations for their use. I have tons of Freud blades and router bits, and my biggest complaint is they almost never have any instructions. The biggest problem with this bit set is when you remove the glass bead. If you are of a 32nd of an inch the tenons will be either to short or to long, and in the earlier case there is no way to correct it. I will still buy Freud products, but I wish they would spend a few bucks and create an instruction manual. Many of their competitors have already done so."
3,Frustrating bits...but do the job well.,"I just used these bits last night and had a heck of a time setting them up. When I finally did get them set they did a great job. Here is what I did - for the stick cut I lined up the black middle cutter with the center line of my 3/4"" stock and made my cut. You can adjust from there if you wish. For the cope cut I had to use trial and error until I had a proper fit. Using a router lift like a JessEm works great for this. 3 stars to Freud for not including any instructions, 5 stars for the way the cutters cut. Don't bother calling Freud, they do not respond. HEY FREUD, HOW ABOUT SOME INSTRUCTIONS!!!!! CAN YOU HERE US NOW!!!!"
4,Very pleased,"I have used many Router Bits in the past, but nothing this big. Over the last few days I have set these bits up and run them, with very good results. They require a hefty router and table, but they both cut a very clean edge. The fit between the edges made by the two bits is excellant. They are very wide and require a router table with a large hole. The first table I used was not large enough to accomidate the bit. Overall I am very pleased with these bits."
4,Handy cart,"I have been using and abusing this cart since I got it from Amazon. It is highly maneuverable and, with a quick change of the pins, is storable in a small space.It doesn't hold as much as I'd like in terms of volume. The flaps on the straps come undone pretty easily. And it is hard to upend the cart as you would a wheelbarrow to empty the contents. And when you do upend the cart, not everything falls out.It is strong and light. All in all, I recommend the cart for light to medium gardening."
2,allsop wheelbarrow,"I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this product. When it came, the box was ripped on both ends. the gripper part of thehandles were dirty and one of them was ripped. Don't know if that was from shipping. There were no directions enclosed.After spending 45 minutes to get it together I gave up.I was very surprised that you would have to change the pins when you store and then again when you use. Think that would be very difficult as time goes on and you use the product.As a woman, I would have problems changing the pins."
4,a little too big,This wheelbarrow is great. Very light weight. easy to put together and easy to store. The flexible material that the barrow is made out of is convenient for pushing piles of leaves or slinging piles of dirt onto.My only complaint is that the handles are spaced very wide and heavy loads are difficult to manage and steer. This would not be a problem for a big burly guy. I would reccommend the smaller size for women or average sized people.
4,Music is a great Mix,"Hate the first song. Loved the rest. Streisand, James Taylor... the voices are all great and the music selections are wonderful (except #1)."
2,Big disappointment!,I was sorely disappointed when I purchased and listened to this CD. I have listened to Tony Bennett for years and unfortunately he has lost his touch. I think it is time for him to hang it up.
3,Disappointing,"Didn't enjoy as much as the other ""duet"" CD's I've collected. Will give it to my mother. Choice of songs just didn't set right. I guess I expected something more powerful - just didn't cut it."
4,Great classics with a twist,"A Christmas gift for my husband, I was concerned this CD may be too ""soft"" and the duets may be overpowering. We both were pleasantly surprised by the arrangements and overall quality of the CD. Tony is in great form and his musical partners compliment his voice and music.Great music for entertaining."
4,Well done Tony,A very good selection of Tony's hits.......He learned a lot by following the production examples of Francis Albert Sinatra!
3,Duets,I think Tony Bennett is one of the all time bests and was looking forward to getting this CD. I was totally disappointed with the selection of songs and in some cases who he sang them with.
3,Easy listening,"This is good background music for an evening at home. I expected it to be more engaging with catchier arrangements. But, it's just fine the way it is."
2,Disappointed,The quality of the voice reproductions of the companion artists was very disappointing. Many of the voices were hardly recognizable without referring to the jacket cover.Marv
3,Easy listening?,"This CD was a bit disapointing as it seemed overdone, in many ways. Too many guest artists with completely differents styles trying to sing Bennet's arrangements, made for not so easy listening. All were in good voice, especially Tony, but one or two selections at a time is the way to play this compilation."
2,disappointing at best,TONY BENNETT IS GREAT. THIS ALBUM IS NOT HOW I WOULD LIKE TO REMEMBER HIM.IF YOU LIKE AN INDIVIDUAL SONG FIND IT ON YOU TUBE. NO SALE!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Mixed Review,"Am I the only one who wondered if some of these voices were 'enhanced'? I had no idea Tim McGraw was on this CD from simply listening to it. It didn't sound like him at all. There were a couple of others that left me wondering as well.I am certainly no expert on Tony Bennett music, but I can usually pick up on a voice.I enjoyed the CD, with these small exceptions."
3,Tony,"Tony Bennett has always been one of my favorite singers. However, the songs just didn't seem inspired, as I had hoped."
5,As Good As It Gets,"Every song, every singer is terrific. Very well done, from who sings what, the precise arrangement that makes each singer sound great, and Tony as an anchor that pulls it all together. Great stuff."
2,Solo para gustos clasicos americanos,"Con todo el respeto que se merece el señor Tonny Bennett, este es un álbum bién hecho como todo lo que hace pero exclusivamente para gustos americanos, muy americanos diria, y con muchos artistas invitados que no están en su misma onda. El es un icono, quizás el único que queda vivo de los tiempos de Sinatra y considero lo han sobrevalorado en los últimos años, pero como dije es más un artista de Estados Unidos que de el mundo. Como nota curiosa Tonny Bennett se negó a participar en un álbum parecido a este que realizara Paul Anka y donde le invitó a cantar "" My Way"" ( A mi manera ), vacio que Paul Anka logró llenar con la interpretación de Julio Iglesias cantante que multiplica en exitos, ventas, conciertos, grabaciones y logros a este icono americano."
2,Sad very sad,"My wife bought this for me. I was really looking forward to listening, but I found it a painful experience. I not sure if it is the song choices, the production values, the arrangements or a combination, but the album overall is just a huge disappointment. No songs from it have made it on to my Ipod."
4,Very nice,"I liked it, not as much as the sinatra duets but Tony Bennett is one of kind like Frank and so good to see him well and still singing into his 80's!"
4,Tony Bennett,"Great duets, enjoyed every song on the CD!! He still continues to amaze me with that silky voice. He's a legend...."
2,tony should have sung solo,Tony Bennett sounds great on this cd. Too bad those he paired up with range from average to down right awful.
3,He might as well sing alone,"I admit to being disappointed. Oh I liked the orchestration and Tony's singing. But there didn't seem to be collaboration with his guests, they were stuck seeing how well they could do it his way, taking turns singing with him. Is that a fair duet? Streisand of course held her own, but other great artists were compromised, I felt. Still -- great songs, nice sound."
3,Not bad but the voice is going--sorry,"I would say ""OK"" but it is not of the quality of the Ray Charles' duets. Tony is fantastic but time diminshes the quality of the voice."
2,Uninspired and disappointing,"I was so looking forward to this CD but it turned out to be absolutely awful. The song choice is uninspired and Tony's voice is just not what it used to be. Just listen to him murder his own signature tune: ""I Left My Heart..."" Some of the guests cannot handle standards, to wit McCartney, Juanes etc...The cut with k.d.lang is halfway decent, but then they've done this before...Just another slick packaging deal."
2,Disappointing,Very canned and boring. Seemed like the duets were two separate recordings that were mixed together
3,Bridging the generation gap,An interesting exercise with modern performers a generation younger than Tony himself. Good quality with an excellent finishing track with Stevie Wonder.
4,"If you like Tony Bennett, you'll love this CD","I knew I had to have this CD when I saw the video. My sister and I listened to it while driving in the Sierras to family's for Christmas. We loved each song and thought of other friends and family who would appreciate a copy. Get a copy now while Tony's still around. The duets are classic, heartfelt and a must for any Tony Bennett fan."
4,Review of Tony Bennet's Duets,"It's fun! Tony Bennet has got a lot of friends on there. The one song that could really melt me would be ""The Shadow Of Your Smile"", when Juanes starts singing in spanish. He's definitely got his own flavor."
2,An American Classic - Tony Bennett,Not up to today's quality of content expectations. Disappointing as to second time listening.
4,Add this to the PLUS column...,"I've read all the reviews to date and must say that beauty, clearly, is in the ear of the beholder. If you want the variety that comes from listening to Tony B. with a range of artists, singing timeless classics, then this one's for you. Bennett may be past his prime, and several of his friends may be trying to hard to impress, but the overall sound is ear-friendly and quite enjoyable."
5,Classic Tony Bennett,"If you love Tony Bennett's style of music, then don't miss this album. Tony is very generous in giving his duet partners a chance to shine. I'm always amazed at his range of virtuosity and talent, and his love of jazz. This is an album you'll want in your collection."
5,thanks Amazon for a great price on the CD,"bought it for my dad for XMAS gift and he plays it in the car he loves it.great price also,"
2,Disappointment,"I am 85 years old, and my memory of Tony Bennett songsis much different than on this album. I do not recognize many of the people he sings. I realize they are of a different generation, and this presentation of the material is not what I expected. I would recommend that Amazon present the content, song and singers, on the order form. Had I known I probably would have ordered a more ""traditional"" Tony Bennett album. My bad!"
5,Amazing Tony,"If you want a combination of the great tunes with a fresh touch, BUY this CD. It makes a great gift. The recipiant will be amazed and very pleased."
3,Mr. Bennett is great all by himself,"Tony Bennett's voice has reached a wonderful resonance that only age can bring.I wish he would re-record the American Songbook solo. I find the other ""greats"" on this cd an intrusion. Please Mr. Bennett?"
3,Tolerable but falls short of its potential,"As much as I wanted to rate this album higher, befitting Tony's legendary status, I couldn't because it suffers from ""too many cooks in the kitchen."" Like so many of these collaborations, some of the singers paired with Bennett work (McCartney, Michael, Streisand, John, and a surprisingly good Bono), some are adequate (Dion, Wonder, Joel, Juanes) and some fall into the ""what-were-they-thinking"" category (The Dixie Chicks, McGraw and John Legend).And no matter how much respect I have for the legendary crooner, Bennett's voice is, expectedly, not what it used to be and on some songs, he strains and has wavy tones.However, one can't deny his musical status and the fact that he was able to get so many top-notch talent to support is a testament to that fact.And the choice of songs can't be denied; they are all bonafide ""classics"" in the truest sense of the term."
4,Tony Bennett Duets An American Classic,"I have had Tony Bennett Duets for a while now and listen to it often. I am surprised at so many negative reviews. I guess it is a matter of taste. I may not care for every song, but I do love many of them especially ""It Had to be You"". This music is from my parents generation and this song was there song. I actually had it played at my wedding as a surprise to them. Love it. I didn't give this 5 stars because I don't really care for some of the other artists. I think it is a help to the other artists to sing with Mr. Bennett. I especially liked KD Lang. What a beautiful voice. I would recommend this CD to anyone that likes classic music."
4,Buy Larry Sager's book and take advantage of the Amazon offer,"I bought this CD along with Larry Sager's bookNo Guns, No Knives, No Personal ChecksThe Tales of a San Francisco Cab DriverAmazon's offer of BETTER TOGETHER is FANTASTIC and a money saver"
2,Disappointed,"Tony's voice sounds old and tired on this CD. These new versions of some of his classics are not up to snuff. If you like the duets format, buy Sinatra's."
5,perfect gift!,"The CD came even faster then expected, This is what my secret santa person asked for. She is going to love it!"
3,Disappointing,"I love Tony Bennett, but I found this album to be boring and manipulative. He is cashing in singing with all these popular singers to bring in the younger crowd"
2,Tony Bennett is better on his own..,"I am a huge Tony Bennett fan, but the duets on this cd are absolutely horrible. When you put so-so artists with a legend like Tony, it just seems to insult his music.Go with buying his solo albums, those are the true pieces of art."
5,Excellent listening,Tony Bennett and friends do a marvelous job with the music. It's hard to believe he is as old as he is. His voice gets better a he grows older.
3,A must for Tony Bennett Fans,I wasn't a big Tony Bennett fan before buying this CD but have really enjoyed it. The PBS Special peaked my interest. Great songs and arrangements make all the songs a listening pleasure. The only draw back is trying to grab the CD to figure out who is singing with Tony. K.D. Lang was amazing.
5,The perfect anniversary present,"I purchased the Tony Bennett Duets album as an aniversary present because my wife requested it as a ""perfect love gift"". Just to ""sweeten"" the occasion,I also threw in a new Chrysler PT Cruiser."
5,Buy the CD/DVD version,"Each track of this album is unique and beautifully performed & orchestrated. The songs & artists are a mix of different types of music & each artist's familiar style works perfectly with Tony's interpretation. I recommend the cd/dvd package, and that the buyer play the dvd first, and later, make time to sit and listen to the album in its entirety (I listened with headphones, and was carried away). The tracks are exciting and at times, very moving. Another jewel in Tony's crown - what will become a classic album, along with THE ART OF ROMANCE."
3,Not that good,"Worst version of ""...San Franciso"" he's ever done.Some of the singing partners ain't so good, either.He seems to have a close relationship with some,so I can understand why he chose him/her."
3,Enjoyable,"I was in a restaurant that was playing Tony Bennett music and I couldn't figure outwho he was singing with but I loved the song - (George Michael ""How do you keep themusic playing?"") I googled it and saw it was from this CD that I had never heard of. Orderedit and I do like it a lot. The George Michael song is my favorite. Love the duet with MichaelBuble and the Dixie Chicks. Others are a little lame, especially the Streisand number and I am aStreisand fan! I still think this is a good cd and enjoy listening to it in my car."
3,Bennett and company,Wasn't very impressed with this cd. I thought they could have chosen a better selection of songs.
4,Enjoyable!!,"I got this as a gift. He has paired with such unexpected artists. I grew up listening to these songs with my parents who were from the WWII era.... it wasn't as spectacular as I was expecting.... the songs are done in a very slow, Tony Bennett way... I expected peppier versions."
1,Christmas Gift,"I gave this as a Christmas gift to my dad, and he returned it to me, saying ""Tony Bennett"" can't sing any more."" I had heard Tony on Jay Leno I believe, and thought he still sounded okay, but my dad remembers the past, when Tony really had a voice."
3,A FINELY TUNED MASTER TAKES CHARGE,"TONY HAS NEVER SOUNDED BETTER AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF STREISAND HE JUST BLOWS EVERYONE OUT OF THE WATER ON THIS ONE WITH HIS SEASONED VOICE AND INCOMPARABLE MUSICALITY.STANDING NOTE TO NOTE WITH BENNETT IS NOT AN EASY TASK AND SINGERSDIANA KRALL AND ELTON JOHN SOUND LIKE RANK AMATEURS. ADDING TO THE AMATEUR NIGHT ATMOSPHERE ARE BUBLE, BONO AND STING WHO SHOULD NOT EVEN BE ON THIS RECORDING. ACTUALLY I WOULD PREFER TO HEAR TONY BY HIMSELF UNLESSWE CAN CONVINCE TONY AND MS.STREISAND TO DO A WHOLE CD TOGETHER. THAT WOULD BE NICE."
3,only half the order arrived,I ordered both Duets 1 and 2. Only the first one arrived. I am wondering where the other CD is. My account was charged for both. Very unhappy.
1,Pandering,"Listening to this CD makes me wonder why he did this. I am a big Tony Bennett fan but the gap between his live performances and his recorded work is huge. This CD is evidence.It has long been known that Bennett pays relatively little attention to his records/CDs. On this point, compare him to Sinatra. Not only would Sinatra be intensely interested in the songs and arrangers whose work he performed but he gave them full credit in a live performance.Compare this to the recorded work of Tony Bennett. His cohorts are there and any interaction between the two of them seems forced and superfluous.Tony Bennett was challenged on two CDs, his two duet albums with Bill Evans. Bennett sounded different in those CDs, as he stepped on the gas to keep up with Evans. On this CD he lets someone else do the driving."
1,If it were only Tony alone,"This album contains 19 tracks. About 16 of them prove these big name singers should not be on this album. Tony, as always, sounds great."
3,What a Disappointment!,"Let me preface this rating by saying that I have been a Tony Bennett fan for over 50 years. His songs are magnificent. However, this cd did not impress me at all. The artists added nothing to the music which was extremely draggy, slow, and rather boring. It just didn't have the ""umph"" Sinatra's ""Duets"" had."
2,TONY-YES / GUEST STARS-NO,"There's no doubt that Tony knows his business and the types of songs that fit him best. And while this CD is filled with many ""superstar"" guests singing duets with him, it just seemed lackluster overall.Practically every song had Tony singing the first verse with the guest artist coming in on the second verse. Both usually wrapped up the song together; but not before verbal praise was dished out from Tony to his co-artist (come on...Stevie Wonder...full???) or vice-versa SOMEplace in the song. Come on...cut the yapping and sing the song already!This SHOULD have been a much more entertaining CD. Unfortunately, it drags along from start to finish."
2,Not Up to Hype,"I fell prey to the advertising, and found the songs on the disappointing side of enjoyable. More a gimmick than a good listening experience."
1,Dissapointed,I am sorry to say this is one of the worst CD's I bought. I thought with all the wonderful performers it was gone to be awsome. The backgrond music sounds boring. I know it's old songs but I guess I expected it to be more upbeat. I wouldn't sugest this to anyone unless you were a big Tony Bennett fan.
5,Fantastic.,"To Whom it may concern: If you like Tony Bennett guy this. This crooner is 85 years old and going strong. If you like some of the old standards and dislike punk rock, or rap this could do it for you. Not a geezer album either. All the duets with KD Lang, Elton John, Paul Mc Carney, just to name a few. I've loved it ever since I bought it and I think you will too. GET THIS CD and Duets II. Also, available on Amazon and do it soon or for Christmas presents for your parents or yourself. You'll be glad you did. Sincerely, Gary L. Schepers."
5,Great Set of Stars,Unbelievable.....all the songs and artists are singing my favorite songs. Plenty of Ballads and I find this CD soothing and romantic. Hooray for Tony Bennett proving that beautiful music is Timeless.
4,Tony Bennett,"What can you say about Tony Bennett that hasn't already been said? He's an icon, a living legend with one of the smoothest and most listenable voices on earth. This album, recorded with any number of other legends and one-hit wonders, is just awesome. Tony is so smooth -- what is he 84 or something? -- and such a gentleman. He's the real star, and the others are simply window dressing. Yet you can see that he admires and is deferential to them. Great easy listening from the giant ... this is a man who performs as if he's 30 and is an accomplished painter as well! Who knew? Get it --"
2,Duets: Tony Bennett CD,"I was VERY disappointed ! These are all really old songs, and it was just boring, and the songs chosen were awful. I expected the guest musical artists to be doing ""classic"", and there are so many wonderful choices in that category. Why those songs? Who knows? I gave the album away."
1,Never got the download of Tony Bennett Duets,And didn't know how to redown load it after purchasing. Asked for assistance and never got any assiatnce. Would have liked some help.
4,Tony at his best,"Great selection of artists. Tony's voice has matured with age: he doesn't ""shout"" any more. His duet with Paul Mc Cartney was especially emotional considering I am from the Beatle generation. Here was one of the four singing a jazz standard together with one of the best crooners of all times."
4,No One's Better Than Tony,"I really enjoyed this CD. His previous CD ""The Art Of Romance"" was excellent and this new CD makes a nice little set for me. If you like Tony Bennett, you'll want to add this CD to your collection."
5,A great place to start,"I like both the earlier Lean Transformation book and this follow up assessment workbook.Its ideal in situations where a number of business units or functions have already started their lean journey and you wish to create an accelerated co-ordinated enterprise wide program.It has a clear, simple structure with a practical framework (or model if you prefer) which takes you through the various organisational capabilities and assesses their readiness for lean change.If you already possess a good basic grounding in Lean principles and end-to-end thinking you be able to get the most out of this book.For the Lean practitioner this book is a life saver, enabling you to get a good understanding of your organisations current state of lean readiness before embarking on the creation of an enterprise wide solution.The absence of Lean Service Assessment tools prevent me giving this book five stars. If you are in a manufacturing company then its a five star book."
5,"Very thorough, contemporary and informative.","This is a thorough 285 page discourse on all the aspects of Online Dating.It is actually a Primer on Dating in general but applied to the specific mode of Online Dating.I needed the advice, as I knew my Profile and pictures of self, and pics of special interest to me, were lacking.I consequently edited my Profile on Match.com about 4 times and actually got praise from some ladies, who I emailed to check my editing work. They appreciated me more after my editing as suggested by reading this book.I bought it used, like new for about $4.00; well worth it."
3,Died after a few months,"I bought this Volume controller, and it was great for a few months... then it died.I tried contacting support. Initially I was responded to ... I even was asked for my address. Then I got radio silence from support for a few weeks.Not sure what's going on, I thought Niles support was good --- I guess I was wrong.--- UPDATE ---Instead of relying on EMAIL based support, which went unanswered, I made a phone call, and I was greeted warmly and quickly.They didn't pay shipping for the RMA, but at least I got one relatively painlessly.New unit should be here shortly ... and before it broke, the volume controller was amazing, so switching my 1 start up to a 3 star"
3,good for some locations,I bought several pairs of these as I wired up speakers throughout our house and patio. The ones I installed on the inside of the house are still going strong after a couple years. The 3 one I installed outside in our covered patio. It worked well for sometime but then one channel just up and quit. It is recessed on a wall that provides shelter from any outside elements so it was not damaged from rain or other.Good for inside - but choose another model for patios
4,"A steamy, poignant and moving story.","This was the first book I read by Samantha James and I was very touched by it. The hero was sexy and kind to the people, despite their wariness of him. The way she represented the village people's prejudice was very accurate and I felt for Dominic. She portrayed him as a man who feels just like anyone else, despite his stern exterior. The electricity between him and Olivia was extremely good, but I also liked the tenderness between them as well. I liked the way the author gradually began to wear away the heroine's prejudice and the secondary love story with the heroine's sister was good, too. I'm hoping there will be a sequel."
1,What an epiphanny,"Good academic papers are intended to obtain insights into difficult problems that cannot be analyzed without a model. There is a however a tendency among some academics to write utterly useless papers to justify their existence. This paper is a classic example of such shenanigans. There is absolutely nothing that you would learn from this stupid model that the author creates. It appears that the author had tons of free time and no useful project, so he just wrote down some math in a pompous manner to try to appear busy and bamboozle the readers taht he has come up with some solid insights. Any person with basic common sense would know much of the so called insights that this rubbish paper presents."
5,Small Print - Great content!,"For content this bible is in a class of it's own!Very small print though - and even smaller print in sidebar notes.Still if you have no problems reading small print, this is a great value."
2,Not recommended,"Sorry, but I do not recommend this edition of the Thompson chain Study Bible.That is, I don't recommend the Thomas Nelson edition. For that matter, the Kirkbride edition is not much better.If I try to use this Bible to preach out of, or teach out of, all the pages are curled up before I'm even finished (and I'm a short-winded preacher!)The reason is, the pages are too thin.Also, the leather is atrocious, and not what it used to be.Take it from someone who owns a Thompson Chain Reference Bible in every available translation: They don't make them like they used to.Not recommended."
1,Bizarrely garbled transcription,"This is the one Orquesta Tipica Victor CD not to get - with one caveat. Something went terribly wrong in the engineering and the tracks are all distorted and garbled. I thought it might be the source material, but many of the same recordings can be heard on the Harlequin HQCD 155, ""Orquestra Tipica Victor"" CD in fine sound. Harlequin's two OTV CDs (1926-1931) have very good sound, better than both Bandoneon label OTV CDs. It is something of a ripoff that this CD even exists. My one caveat, however: there are some extraordinarily beautiful pieces on this CD that I have found no where else, in particular Tanita de la Proa. I wish some OTV fanatic out there would produce good versions of these tracks."
2,serves purpose,does the job but real cheap in every way. Use it on my scooter. very flimsy \...I would order a better quaility one next time
2,too expensive for material its made of,For the price of this the material it is made of is CHEAP!! I think is a RIP OFF. Would not recommend
3,scooter arm tote,I was a little disappointed in this item. It was not as easily used when secured to the wheelchair/scooter. It is difficult to gain access to the zipper part when in the chair. I do like that it is thin enough so it doesn't get hung up on doorways or crowd the seat space.
5,excellent textbook for serious radio amateur operators,"Our library ordered this book last year and since then Ihave been reading on and off when I get spare time.Beening quite a novice on radio electronics and a amateur radiooperator(bx2ah, ex-bv2wn) in Taipei, Taiwan I am very muchinto any underlying building blocks of the radio art. This bookis particular useful for laymen with only modest college mathbackground.If you are an serious amateur radio operator who wish to learnmore about the workings of your ham rig/antenna,I wholeheartedly highly recommend this brilliant bookto you.frank chen bx2ah, ex-bv2wn"
1,Neither an advanced nor introductory text.,"(Disclaimer: an EE professor at the school I attended wrote the book.)I found this book horrible. It neither provides useful intuition nor rigorous analysis. The book is written as if it were an introductory text but it fails to cover a lot of fundamental topics (especially basic transistor circuits) that are critical for such a book. Additionally, the book spends a lot of text making useless analogies (like LRC oscillator to a pipe instrument.)The overall approach of the book is to take a very detailed theoretical and practical explanation of a specific (NORCAL 50?, I think) radio. The approach makes it very difficult to apply its lessons to designing your own radio or high frequency electric circuits."
1,Electronics of Radio,"This book is composed by Prof. David Rutledge. His class required the book, which is the sole reason for the book entering my hands. This book, and the related course EE20 were the bane of my existence. The book is useless at explaining the basics of electronics. The book solely serves as a cookbook for the construction of a NORCAL radio. It fails at teaching important conecepts, and could only be used by the most faint-hearted hobbyist. On a related note, I have a spare book if anyones interested in buying one. As for now, it just holds up one end of my dorm room bed."
3,"Beautifully written, but tends toward repetitive","Levoy is a talented, beautiful writer and his concept of ""callings"" is a powerful way to make us all think about how to make our lives meaningful, and how to listen to that inner voice that our society is so good at training us to tune out.However, the concept wears thin after about 100 pages. It gets repetitive. By the end of the book I felt like I feel after I've eaten too much chocolate. A little less would have been just as good.Some of his examples get pretty new-agey, which is a shame since I think you can find your inner voice, listen and respond to your callings without having to go meditate in some desert or adopt a belief system that seems a bit ""out there."" His message is compelling enough that I'd hate to see it lost on people who aren't as inclined as he is toward the ethereal.Still, compelling food for thought and a good way to kick yourself in the pants if you're feeling ""stuck"" and knowing there most be more to life than this."
3,Competes with Bartlett's,"A very interesting book, yet I found it difficult because nearly every page contained one to three quotations introduced in the following manner...""As _______ wrote...""""_______ said...""After a while, I felt more that I was reading Levoy's collection of other people's inspirational nuggets than gaining any insight he had. Five stars for research. Three stars for readability."
2,What the heck was that all about?!!!,"Apparently, I'm the only person who found this book extremely tiresome. It was like trying to read Jungian philosophy as if written by Henry James. By the time you get to the bottom of the page, you've forgotten what the point was in the first place! Round and round and round we go and where he stops, nobody knows! Additionally, I found all of the quotes distracting and for the most part, unnecessary. Perhaps the reason Levoy used them is because he can't claim to be an expert in this field and had to back up his statements with those of other, more well-known experts. This book is not for someone looking for a clear direction in which to proceed. However, if you like spirituality and new-age philosophy in the abstract, then I guess you'll like this book. However, it was for me, as ""Bill the Cat"" would say, ""Aaack!!"""
5,Mesmerizing and Enduring,"""Callings"" is one of my all-time favorite books. The beautiful writing is enhanced by the deep and practical non-stop references he makes to underscore his key points. There's an expression about writers that absolutely applies to him and that is: ""Wow, can he turn a phrase!"" This book was seductive to me and made me want to savor every page, re-read it and commit it to memory. The stories connect us back to ourselves and what feeds our souls. A true jewel that I am grateful to have found.Besides the great stories, the pace of the book continued to draw me in and enchant me with one compelling idea after another. The selected and numerous references became great fodder for future reading as well.One of my favorite phrases (that I cannot remember the context for but is great nonetheless): ""mainlining the Serenity Prayer."" Gotta love it!Gregg's work is a gift to anyone who is breathing.K. OstaAsheville, NC"
5,Cosmic Truth,"Callings is one of the best, most intrigueing books I have ever read. Gregg Levoy not only sets a new standard in the literary world, but also invites a new way of life with his seductive prose. This book is the escape hatch from a reality of enertia to a world of magical enthusiasm as it unlocks an existence beyond the mundane. I can't think of anything more prevalent for a society who is mesmerized by vague entertainment and somewhat numb from its daily doses of propaganda."
5,something for everyone,I read and re-read this book. I highlighted and scribbled. I sat with friends and discussed passages that meant something to me. This book was a catalyst for exploration and a mirror to other situations in my own life. Read and enjoy the journey.
1,Not authentic....an oxymoron,"Funny, that the book about living an authentic life is quote after quote after quote from already famous people. It seems that the author wants to join ranks with oft-quoted writers, but hasn't earned it yet... I much prefer a book that doesn't just keep repeating the words of others who were authentic...."
2,Like reading a list of urban legends,"This book is very hard to work through: Mr. Levoy writes like he's stringing together a bunch of not-fact-checked note cards arranged in no particular order. At least one of his stories were discredited decades before he dropped it into his book, so I couldn't cut him some slack for writing pre-Google. Infrequently he tells a personal story, and the sincerity stands out against the random background. Rather than examining my own callings and vocation, I just marveled - this guy is making a living with this!"
1,Hated the audio product,"This audio book,was by far the worst I have ever heard. The pace was too fast and a monotone.I believe the book content is good, but I got nothing from my intial listenng. Perhaps in a car where your mind is captured, however cars no longer have tape players"
3,"kind of a ""cosmetic"" soccer ball","beautiful ball- and yes, it is cheaper than the MLS stadium vendors.But it's kind of ""cosmetic""- it's great to look at - just not to play with. It's really glossy leather and it kind of sticks to your skin if you juggle barefoot. Also it seems kind of light and too bouncy- like a beachball.If you like the team, buy it, get it autographed, put it on the mantle. If you want to play soccer then buy a regular, cheap ball."
2,boring,"Our Love to Admire is decent background music but nowhere near as good as Turn on the Bright Lights. The only standout song is The Heinrich Maneuver. The rest of the album isn't bad, it's just kind of boring."
2,Damaged.,"When my record arrived, and I realized that all four corners were bent, I knew this wasn't going to be good.I opened the record, and both panels were busted, and fell completely apart.I was hoping for a better product from a top rated seller, but this is not worth the money I spent."
2,"Thumbs Down to ""Admire""","I was eagerly anticipating this album's release, but upon purchasing it the first day it came out, I have been thoroughly disappointed with this album. Contrary to what others are writing, I think it sounds very little like their first two records.While the bass lines might be there and the pulsating voice of the lead singer are still in effect, there is something missing on each of these tracks on this record.In the past, there has been slow-building energy within each song but that seems to be missing this time around. Not to say the album is pop-rock now, because that is not the case, the album does seem to pander more toward the commercial rock radio stations.I miss the old Interpol. I was hoping for more of ""Antics"" and/or"" ""Turn On the Bright Lights,"" but instead I am left with a record that sounds as though a band is simply going through the motions with NO emotion, passion or intensity in its music. Frankly, the record is garbage."
1,Lyrics not enclosed!,With the cd I do not need to see someone's selection of wild animal pics. What I do need is a convenient copy of the lyrics of the songs. Doesn't the band care even THAT much about the words? Shame!
4,My Love to Admire,"What can I say about 'Our Love to Admire'? I do quite like this album, and probably more so than most Interpol fans. It beats the latest competition out of respect for the nice, mechanical, somber vocals and overall sound. The bass, though not as heavy as 'Turn on the Bright Lights' is still very post-punk revival. And the connection is there. Poetic, lovely, gloomy... and I'm not describing Edgar Allen Poe because this album is a bit more ""How are things on the West Coast?"" and less ""Me and my Annabel Lee""."
4,Great album great band...,"In a world washed over with a myriad of great Indie bands, Interpol has a sound and a feel that I can't get enough of. Are they the greatest band ever... I am uncertain I would wish to make that statement of anyone... are they a solid band that I find myself drawn back to again and again... hell yes! Well crafted and conceived. This album has the ""interpol"" sound of uneasiness and loss that I can't help but love. Are there other great Indie bands? Yes... but if you pass this album up it is your loss. Will you discover a new sound that no one has ever heard before? No... But after 50 years a rock... there is little left to discover. Interpol is a great band, with an over all solid CD that I enjoy from beginning to end... and that is rare these days."
5,great album!!,"it took a while for interpol to grow on me. i would have give the album 3 stars after the first listen, but this album just keeps getting better and better with each listen. i'd give it more than 5 stars by now if i could"
2,Why is this a good album?,"Well, it's not a good album. Everyone who is looking at this review right now loves Turn on the Bright Lights. If you liked Antics, then the drugs must be working better for you than for me, a decent album though. Without their name, Our Love to Admire would go completely unnoticed. There is nothing happening on this record. It is a parade of the same banal recipe. Their first single is semi catchy, but, other than that, no other songs jumped out at me. Please find some inspiration for your band, so you can inspire your fans like you once did."
5,Back to the first album effort,"As an Interpol fan, I'm impressed that they stay true to their sound without sounding the same on each song. Non-stop summer listening so far."
3,I miss the Bright Lights,"I have tended to like the more kinetic Interpol songs (Obstacle 1, Say Hello to the Angels, P.D.A., Slow Hands, Evil) with a few exceptions (NYC, The New, Next Exit), so unfortunately, this album does not really deliver the goods. At their worst, Interpol is laborious and plodding, and the down beat places more musical emphasis on Paul Bank's lyrics - which is not a good thing. For the most part, Interpol seems to be at or near their worst on this album. At least it has me listening to Bright Lights again."
2,Missed the mark again,"After being pleasently surprised by Turn On The Bright Lights and how it's subtle understated songs became so infectious that I wanted to hear them again and again, I was quite dissappointed by Interpol's next release Antics. The band was quite aware of the appeal of the first release and tried desperately to repeat it with no luck. While Antics had some glimmers of special moments Our Love To Admire is absolutely lack lustre. The boys once again try to capture the magic of Turn On The Bright Lights but fall even farther from that goal. And believe me, I wouldn't care at all if they did something vastly different just as long as it was good. Our Love To Admire is not good. At this point I think Interpol themselves must be wondering how they managed such to write such great songs their first time out but can't seem to even come close to writing a memorable song these days... I know I am."
2,it pains me to do this...,"a major let down, from one of my favorites,so close, if they would of just inched a bit closer to that edge,and they did on a few numbers ""pioneer"" is great, as is ""the lighthouse"" and ""wrecking ball"",sadly the rest ranges from average to very subpar""threesome"" ""h. manuver"" ""chemistry"" and ""mammoth"" are very by the numbers interpolthe remaining 4 are total clunkers...i will go and see them on this tour, as they are great live (except at festivals and larger shows) but i will pray and hope the rebound from thishonestly, i am not trying to slag on them, but it makes me so sad i wanted this to be so good"
2,A disservice to Interpol fans,"I have long loved Interpol because of the deep, if enigmatic and shapeless, lyrics that they convey over dark, reverberating bass. For olta, they have taken the lyrics that so enraptured me with their stunning imagery (such as ""I'm going to hold your face and toast the snow that fell,"" a favorite of mine) and replaced them with trashy, obnoxious songs about how having sex with too many groupies is wearing the singer out, and toned down the bass that was so important to their sound. What the hell, man? I wanted Interpol, the band that used to ask questions that intoned deep introspection on the human condition and used to make music that I could get lost in and didn't care about finding my way out, not Interpol--the band that has way too much sex. Ditch this trash and get their first two albums instead."
4,Interpol's Effort to Admire,"After an awkward transformation on Antics, Interpol has grown to accept the cool swagger that made Turn On the Bright Lights so compelling. Interpol's third album, by no means an attempt to recapture the Turn On the Bright Lights magic, is a definite turn toward maturity that can be best seen in the strengthened song writing on this album. The album's opener, ""Pioneer to the Falls"" displays the fruits of this maturity: more atmospheric composition punctuated by a familiar-yet-not-trite rhythm section. ""No I in Threesome"" and ""The Heinrich Maneuver"" are excellent reminders of how groovy Interpol really is. And the experimental ""The Lighthouse"" ends the album on a weird/moody note. Indeed after listening to Our Love to Admire,one gets the same feeling one gets from Turn on the Bright Lights: almost everything is right with the world. Almost."
4,#3 but closing the gap,"Like everyone who owns the prior Interpol albums, and heard ""The Heinrich Maneuver"", the expectations for OLTA were perhaps too great. I agree with some of the major critiques here: drums & bass are silenced on this album, the album is softer, lacks a real knockout song, etc. However this album turns the corner and grows on you after a few more spins. Daniel Kessler's guitar work is so masterful, no wonder it seems to outshine the rhythm section. If you are down about this album after a listen or two, be patient and take another listen. Because it is no Turn on the Bright Lights, doesn't mean it is bad. This is still Interpol, one of the best bands of the decade. As far as the lack of the knockout song, a few spins have changed my mind also. I am now in the camp that thinks that Pioneer to the Falls ranks up there as one of their best ever."
3,A little disappointing compared to Antics,"Solid album though no songs particularly stood out for me like they did on their two previous albums. Save for the last more ambient sounding song ""The Lighthouse"", it's pretty typical Interpol: grim, tight, textured, and with Paul Bank's usual oblique lyrics. While they're not really breaking any new ground with this album, if you're already a fan of the band, it's a satisfying record, just not as dramatic or memorable as their others."
1,ian curtis blew three farts in the 1970's that were better,"Interpol, yawn. Ian Curtis blew three farts in the 1970's that were better than these CDs. And more exciting! They should be called Joy Revision. Not new. Not different. Nothing to write home about."
4,Number 3 with a Rocket!,"No, INTERPOL does not break any major new ground with this release.Is that a bad thing? Not at all.Interpol has truely come into its own sound and OLtA is a tight set of tracks that had me reaching for the repeat button after the first listen. It grabbed me right away and just keeps on getting better. From the catchy first track all the way to the ambient epic of the last, this is one cohesive album that just SOUNDS GOOD!Any fans of the previous two should not be dissappoint with this one, and people who like the favor of some 80s New Wave in their contemporay music should be pleased as well.Three strong albums -- I have high hopes for number four!EDIT: After a couple months of ownership, I have to say that this album is addictive! I have trouble getting out of the CD player in my car! ;')"
5,An amazing posiblities of creating,"When I recieved this software I cannot figure out how many disk contain with the different features that made a lot of possibilities in the graphics world, really satisfied and Iam going to get the DVD version because the package only contain CD's(10) and I prefer not carrying to much. Enjoy"
3,best and worst,"best songs- deja vu, ring the alarm, freakum dress.these songs are amazing; they show a great deal of talent and show a variety of voices and themes of beyonce. best songs beyonce has ever madeeverything else is super boring espcially kitty kat and irreplaceable.[...]"
1,It's not what you think,"This cd is a huge disappointment. If you're thinking about buying it, think again. i bought this cd and was disappointed to find many of the songs missing. For example, Listen and Lost Yo Mind and Got Me Bodied are not even on this cd. The only song that was actually on the cd was Irreplaceable, which I don't even like to listen to now because it reminds me of the other songs I wish were on this cd. Once again, this cd was disappointing. Save your money and think about purchasing the extended edition if you really want Beyonce."
1,FLAT,This is one of the worse records I've ever listened to. She doesn't sing she SHOUTS and SCREAMS.
2,Beyonce or Jay Z,Beyonce doesn't do as well without Destiny's Child. All the songs are forgettable and her only hits on both CDs that I like have Jay Z in it. Beyonce needs to get back with the girls and stop depending on Jay Z.
4,love this cd !,"B-day is Beyonce's best ablum yet. I love every song. Very rarely do you find a cd that has more than 2 or 3 good songs. She did a good job on this one ,but she could have put more songs."
3,Not Her Best Work,Most of the tracks are plagued by heavy basslines and Beyonce yelling. I expected more from her.
5,B'Day,"This cd is wonderful. I love it. Beyonce pulls no punches, and I LOVE the in-your-face attitude that she displays on this new album.If you are expecting 2002's ""Dangerously In Love"", I suggest you pull THAT particular cd out and listen to it. You are NOT gonna find it here! Obviously, the only track to follow anything resembling DIL is ""Deja Vu"", but that's where it stops.It's a hard-hitting cd that you can basically dance to.... true club bangers. I like every song, but ""Upgrade U"" is the song that I can't get out of my head! B, Jay, and Cameron Wallace pull together to make a bangin' track.All in all, buy the cd or borrow to form your own opinion."
3,Beyond Beyonce~,"I am a huge fan of Beyonce and DC. I love Beyonce because is talented. However, I did not enjoy the B'Day CD like I did DIL. I understand it is okay to try something new. Some of the songs are okay, some are just annoying; she screams too much. That is just my opinion."
1,Another Disappointment,"I'm not certain what to say about this CD. So I'll keep the review short.I keep hoping against all hope that one day Beyonce will give the listeners something from the depths of her soul. With this CDs drop, I see now that my hope was in vain.The same over-emoting vocals, repetitive beats and elementary songwriting skills, none of which have not matured at all, are all over this sophomore effort of Destiny Child's lead diva.Worse still, the noteworthy tracks are curiously absent from the disc completely. Where is the floor-pounding hit ala 'Crazy In Love' with its propulsive horn sample? Where is the experimentation and expansion (for Beyonce, a pop entertainer), i.e., 'Baby Boy' with its flavourful middle eastern beat? Where are the hits hiding?!Answer: nowhere. They are just not present. And that must be disappointing to her loyal fans.To sum up the review, boring, boring, boring. Skip it."
2,so-so voice,"My view of Beyonce is that's she's eye candy rather than ear candy. Great videos, kinda thin tinny voice I've never been able to appreciate."
1,JUST TERRIBLE,"Beyoncé as leader of Destiny's Child was excellent.Her 1st solo album was good and in line with what she does the best.This 2nd volume is just terrible. Fans are certainly very disappointed ! Go back to singing school, dear. You are worth the best and this CD is certainly not."
2,She Need More Time to work on this CD,I think that she needed more time to work on this cd than 2 weeks. It is not as good as Dangerously in Love. She didnt but in heart into this cd. It was rushed. I would not buy this cd if I was u. Save it and buy Letoya cd which is alot better than Beyonce's. When Jay z is on her songs all the time all I can think about is crazy in love song. Deja Vu is just a lowgrade Crazy in Love. Dont buy this cd the only reason I gave it two stars is that Jay z is on the cd.
2,STOP YELLING PLEASE CALM DOWN,SIMPLY PUT IF YOU PLAN ON GETTING THIS ALBUM BE SURE THAT AFTER YOU MAKE YOUR PURCHASE YOU STOP BY THE DRUGSTORE AND PICK UP SOME EXCEDRINE.ALSO WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF JAY & B GIVE IT A REST.
1,not feeling it,"i like beyonce, but this album aint really do it for me, only song i like was green light, besides that the ablum was basically not worth the buy"
3,So disappointed..!,"I was so mad when I popped this album in. DISAPPOINTED,DISAPPOINTED,DISAPPOINTED!I wasted money on this album! Well, wait I didn't waste my money because I still love Beyonce. She has a beautiful voice, but I don't know what the heck she was thinking with this mess. TRY AGAIN Beyonce!I'm only feeling like 2 or 3 songs..Beyonce, WHAT HAPPEN?Her first album was nice!!! This one was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!*mean face*"
5,"""Different"" But Good!","Ok for those expecting a ""typical"" Beyonce/Destiny's Child album this go round...sorry! This album is more upbeat with 2 slow songs but it's still a really GOOD album. The beats are crazy!!! Beyonce did something a little different this album and I give her a hand clap for that! I mean it gets boring if artists get comfortable and so the same old thing with every record. Go B! Definite addition to my CD collection."
3,Not good!,"Beyonce is a pretty girl. She's not one of the best artists around but she has great potential. Her downfall is that she seems to have a one track mind and sings mostly about sex or wanting to have sex. The only songs that are worth listening to on this album are the ballads of which there are only two:-- ""Resentment"" is a very beautiful and powerful song. If only she would put this kind of soul and power into all of her songs.-- ""Irreplacable"" is very cute and lyrically savvy. It would be a good single.-- ""Listen"" from her new movie Dreamgirls (which I am excited to see) is so so but better than the other garbage she whipped together on this album.I have to mention her new ""single"" ""Ring the Alarm""...it is the most ridiculous song (and video) she has done. If you can believe it ""Freakum"" is more listenable than that junk. The only up-tempos that are any good is ""Deja Vu"" & ""Get Bodied""."
2,O.K. Beyonce take a break.,"I love beyonce, I truly think she's is talented but way over exposed. You can turn a corner without seeing or hearing her. Her new re-released B'Day was just toooo much. Beyonce needs to take a break and come out with music like she did on her first album ""Crazy in love"". B'Day Deluxe Edition is just a way to make more money."
1,Medicore Second Album,"Like many before and like many after her, Beyonce truly has hit the sophmore slump with her B'day album. One would think with all the big name producers and a star of Beyonce's calibear that the album would be amazing but sadly it isn't. The only track that really impressed was the ballad Listen from the upcoming Dreamgirls, other than Listen this is strictely a by the numbers disc."
2,Um...what's really the deal,"I see Beyonce as a very talented young woman, having heard her sing acapella on a television show with Destiny's Child and her vocal and acting ability on THE FIGHTING TEMPTATIONS just to name a few. Her vocals IMO belong on a VOCAL album, whether it be R&B;, Jazz, or Gospel. The productions are really good, I just don't think it does much for her...she seems buried under all the horns, synths, and such. Too much screaming and strain on her awesome voice. And as I have much luv for Jay-Z, her two songs he is featured on, DEJA VU and UPGRADE U all sounds like CRAZY IN LOVE pt. II and III to me.Save your money if you want to hear Beyonce SANG, but add this to your collection if otherwise."
1,What the heck?,This album is downright boring. You can tell she spent two weeks on it. I do NOT advise anyone to buy this.
1,Not a good CD,"I am a beyonce fan, but this album is complete garbage. It is nothing like her first album. I heard she did this album in two weeks and that's exactly what it sounds like. It just seems like she just put something together at the last minute in order to release it in time for her birthday. My favorite song on the album is ""Ring the alarm"" and even then I am not crazy about this song either. There is only 11 songs on this album (the bonus track is part of song #10, you would have to fastforward to hear it). It's not quality music and her voice doesn't sound good either, it seems like she is screaming all the time. I don't even listen to it anymore. Don't waste your money like I did, you'll be thankful you didn't buy the album."
1,Highly Disappointed!,"This has got to be the worse cd from the megastar. I'm just not impressed.There was a tremendous amount of hype surrounding the release of the CD and now that it's out...it's awful! I would advise everyone not to waste your time purchasing this CD. I'm sure she has something else instore for all of her fans in the near future. As a fan, I'm personally disappointed and just expected more from Beyonce."
4,I Like It More Than When I First Bought It...,"I held off on writing a review to see how I felt after a month or so. At first I didn't love it but certainly didn't hate it. I liked Upgrade You and De Ja Vu. As time has passed I like the whole CD more. It's great dancing around the house music.I too thought many of the songs seemed materialistic and ""I don't need a man"" themed but when I heard that she wrote many of the songs from the perspective of saying the things she wishes her character in Dreamgirls could have said (perhaps with a modern twist) I ""got it"" with some of the songs and liked them more. I'm a fitness instructor and I use many of the songs in different classes and they work very well.I'm a Beyonce fan and I do have her other CD as well as several Destiny's Child CD's. If you are a music lover then you'll like this CD. Don't buy it expecting super deep thoughts about life and love...it's fun, straight to the point and dancy but that's fine for me!"
2,What the heck B!,"Looks like someone shouldn't be bragging about how it took them 2 weeks to make this album, because it definitely shows. The only thing that saves this cd is the production. Beyonce was able to get some great beats but put horrible lyrics on this cd. I'm disappointed. I'm a fan b/c Beyonce has a wonderful voice, but this album is not good at all. Maybe 2 tracks that kept my attention."
3,AN OK ALBUM,I GIVE BEYONCE CREDIT FOR TRYINGTHE CD REALLY ISN'T THAT BADYET IT REALLY ISN'T THAT GREATI DO THINK SHE RUSHED TO GET IT OUT TO COMPETEAND THAT PEOPLE WON'T FORGET ABOUT HERAND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE BREAKUP OF DC IS JUST A LIEJUST LIKE THE WHOLE JAY-Z THINGTHEY WILL PROBABLY TAKE A FEW YEARS OFF TO KEEP THEWHOLE DC HYPE THING GOING AND JUST WHEN YOU THINK THERE NOT GONNA EVER GET BACK TOGETHER AND SOME OTHER GROUP COMES ALONGDC WILL BE BACK TO HOPEFULLY WHAT WILL BE LIKE THE MIMI THINGBUT AS FAR AS THIS ALBUM GOES IT'S OK OF COURSE NOT AS GOOD AS HER FIRST ALBUM BUT A STEP UP HOPEFULLY SHE WILL TAKE SOME TIME WITH THE NEXT ALBUM AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T LIKE THE ALBUM AND THINK IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY YOU SHOULD DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE ALBUM AND IF YOU LIKE IT GO BUY THE ALBUM AND YOU WILL SAVE SOME TIME AND MONEY AND THOSE OF YOU WHO JUST BUY THE ALBUM BECAUSE YOU LIKE BEYONCE BUT NOT THE ALBUM AND BROUGT IT JUST TO SUPPORT BEYONCE YOU GUYS ARE STUPID
1,Where's the Zero star rating. This mess don't deserve a star,If you want hear a musical rendition of the hurricane Katrina Aftermath buy B'DAY. No joke this album is worse than a bad ray j album. The beats are corny and the vocals make no sense. Bottom line its the worst piece of *bleep* I heard in years.
1,"Oh Beyonce, Where's The Magic Touch U Once Had?",Since Beyonce started writing songs for Destiny's Child and her solo cd it seemed she could not be stopped. Her pen skills were incredible during those times. In this latest effort it seems that she has dried out a little. The music sounds ok but the lyrics and arrangment are a bit tired and sounds like every other cheap production out there. For a cd with only 10 songs they should have all been great but not really. It kinda makes sense that this cd would suck since the last Destiny album did. Hopefully next time she'll spend more time writing instead of coming up with dumb dance moves and using Janet's left over moves.
1,If you need a NoiseMaker to ring in the New Year Cop B-Day!!!!,"How can anybody in their sane mind praise this juvenile mess?! Beyonce is supposed to be growing lyrically, but she's regressed badly. Yelling, Screaming, Shouting, complaining about a man is not what I call music and it is below expectations. Beyonce needs to regroup with Destiny's Child, she's obviously experiencing the sophomore slump. Thank God for iTunes saving her floptastic singles! Beyonce is overrated, literally. I used to hear people say but didn't quite understand, but she is far from an independent woman. Nothing stands out on any tracks except ruckus! Fans will support, but doesn't mean they really LIKE the music and reviews overall have been painfully honest!!! Retitled: Bidet...!!!"
5,GENIOUS!!!!!!!!!,"Who would ever think of making a Music Video for every song on there album....no other than Beyoncé, I am so happy that the ""B'Day (Deluxe Edition & Video Anthology)"" is out! The Disc 2 is amazing. And Beyoncé, is a really great speaking spanish singer. I love the new song ""Beautiful Liar"" with Shakira. Beyoncé is doing her thing on this album. Totally worth every penny, it is very entertaining too. 10 new music videos of Beyoncé, and several new tracks!!! Go buy it, it's worth it!"
4,A great mix of pop / hiphop,A great mix of pop / hiphop...I really enjoyed this cd I have 3-4 favorites and the rest are pretty good as well. A good cd for younger kids too for the fact it is very clean.
4,Whole different sound on sophomore album,"After reading all the reviews written on this section, I was hesistant to buy the album. I liked ""Deja Vu"", but not enough to buy the album. After hearing ""Ring the alarm"" I changed my mind and got it. As everyone has said before, this album is very different from her debut. There are only two slow songs (if you don't count ""Listen"") and she seems to be singing higher, more like Tina Turner. What I like about this cd is that it's mostly a dance record, where Beyonce seems to cut loose entirely. If you're looking for the kind of lyrics she displayed on her debut album, you won't find any in here. I prefer this one; it shows a complete different side of her, one seen more often in her concerts."
4,"B'Day is your ""Green Light"" to enjoying good music!","Normally, I'm no Beyonce fanatic, but this album is funky as hell. I absolutely love it! I love nearly every song...except Ring the Alarm- the screaming is nerve-wracking. However, overall B'Day is a HOT album! I love it that she tried something different and re-introduced that old school, big band feel; it definately worked! Beyonce, you did that!"
2,Really Wish I hadn't bothered...,"I really don't like this album. There is nothing really solid on here besides her single De Ja Vu and that had to grow on me too. Even the titles to some of the songs just turn me off to the record. I really hope that she does better for the next album, but until then I will just lament over the fact that i spent $11 for her CD and I will continue to play Dangerlously In Love instead."
5,This is a landmark album right here.,"I am listening to Beyonce's album ""B'Day"" right now for the first time - though I've heard snippets of it before. Beyonce is the female version of Michael Jackson as far as I'm concerned."
3,Beyonce tried too hard to make an impression in the biz,"She screeches to much and to tell you the truth, the only song that I can repeat is IRREPLACABLE AND KITTY KAT. Everything else sounds the same. She tried to hard to make a comeback and failed."
1,NOT FEELING NE THING ABOUT THIS,I JUST REALLY DONT LIKE CD. I THINK ITS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT BEYONCE SHOULD HAVE JUST WAITED A COUPLE MONTHS AND MADE IT BETTER. IM GLAD I DIDN'T BUY THE CD. BEYONCE IS GOIN DOWN HILL REAL FAST!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY JUS DOWNLOAD THE CD SOMEWHERE.
2,Try Again,What in the hell is this. Please tell me we are getting punked and the really cd is coming out sometime soon. The worst cd of 2006 to me.
5,Hot!,"This album is great. I've seen some reviews that people have written and I saw their comments on how bad it is. I'd like to say "" Did you people listen to the same songs as I did?"". I think not! It's that or you're not a r and B fan.This album is filled with hot new songs that get you dancing all day.Deja Vu is one of my favorites. It just sounds really good and I loved her dance moves in the video. I loved ring the alarm and many more songs on this album. I liked all the songs pretty much, but ring the alarm and deja vu are my 2 favorites.I loved this album mostly because beyonce stepped and brought her singing to a whole new level. Overall, her vocals were great, her music were great, and the videos were great. This album is hot!"
2,What happened?,What a disappointment I loved her first solo cd her sophomore effort is inferior to say the least. I only liked two songs on the whole disc Deja Vu and Irreplaceable. The bottom line I hope her third cd number will be better than this one and more like the first
2,Not worth the purchase,"Only 2 good songs on this album, if that. Beyonce is way better than this album is."
2,Track order is wrong on first disk,Disk one track 3 should be track 5 and 4 should move up to 3 and 5 up to four.
2,Not what I wanted Disappointed.,"I just purchased this cd from target, for the Single 'Irreplaceable' I am very Disappointed it was not even the same Single track that is played on the Radio,its the Lament stage of the relationship. the track is acapella which showcases her talent, however it mentions nothing about the breakup phase of the relationship. Now I have a cd, I won't use with the wrong single."
5,Different but good!,"Not quite as good as Dangerously in Love but this cd reveals another side of Beyonce'. This cd showcases her diversity, those that gave her a negative review obviously have placed her into a traditional R&B box. Great job gurl....Freakum!!"
2,"not feeling it ""b""","sorry but i like beyonce but i didn't like this cd. yes it's different for her, but for the most part, it's not as nearly as good as her first cd. i only liked at least 3 songs out of 10. i think letoya luckett's cd is much better. just my opinion."
2,"Sorry B, U didn't do it this time",Let me start off by saying that I am a big Beyonce fan. I anticipated the release of this album for months and was very excited to get it. I know that people say that you shouldn't rate anyone if you don't have the same talents as they do but we the fans have the right to rate these artists because we are the ones buying their records.I love B's music but this CD didn't do it like Dangerously In Love did. I think that the CD was rushed (which is why it only has 10 tracks on it). I like the two songs that were released on the radio and I halfway like the song irreplaceable. The other songs sound crazy.Beyonce should have taken her time with this album instead of rushing it to be released on her birthday.Better luck next time B.
3,B'Day Just Okay,"While I definitely respect Beyonce's talent, I wasn't overwhelmed by her sophmore effort. She absolutely has the singing chops, but I wish she'd find something to sing about other than some guy who is driving her crazy (how many more Deja vus & Crazy In Loves do we need to hear?) I think if she works with different producers like Jermaine Dupri,Pharrell Williams or Timbaland, her next CD would be much better."
2,not a good day,"now Beyonce channels Tina Turner but what is going for writing&Production on her Albums isn't reaching those heights. I think if she had a R.Kelly&Brian Mcknight Writing&Producing on her than she would expand on her Vocal Range fully. this album sounds like it was rushed&just made to meet a deadline,not a single memorable strong track. alot of B-Sides at best,but not a single A knock out track. when She Sings She sounds good,but way often than not she is following a formula that wears her album down fast she needs to seperate Business from Personal with Jay Z. enough of those duets. leave the street cred alone. let that Voice be your guiding Light. thus far she has put out two average Albums that arelong on Hype,but short on overall substance."
1,Sounds like it too her 3 weeks to make this album,"This album is HORRIBLE! She switched up her style, she's screaming and over singing on every track, its like my goodness were u in that big of a rush that u couldn't even make sure your vocals were on point? The only good song on this album IMO is Kitty Kat, thats vintage Beyonce. Other than that song, they are horrible. She made the same mistake Ashanti made which is why Beyonce is as big as she is now. Ashanti switched up her style on her second album which Beyonce jacked Ashanti for her style from her first album and blazed her in 2003. Now Beyonce switched up her style and now somebody is gonna come out and blaze Beyonce this year. Don't even waste yo time downloading cuz u not gonna like it."
3,I like the other songs left out,"""He's My Man"" is off the hook!!!! It is soooo HOT!!! I don't know why she would leave this song off. I can't stop listening to it. It's a good song for the radio. This osng brings me back to what beyonce is realy all about. She's crazy not to put this song on. I didn't like ""Creole"". I can see why she didn't use this song. I'm still trying to find ""Lost Yo Mind"""
2,JayZ spoiled it for me - Amazon you should label it elicit content,"I use to think that Beyonce' was a safe CD buy, (no cursing) and since Amazon didn't label it as elicit content I thought it was ok. When I went the music store to buy it, a lady was returning the same cd and said they didn't like it. She saw I was purchasing the same and offered me a deal to buy her's. Stupid me I should have asked what she didn't like about it, but when I played it and got to the song Up Grade U, and Jayz's intro with him say s---t that killed the whole mood of the CD for me. It made the CD feel negative. I said to myself I can't give this to my kids! Although Beyonce isn't cursing she has someone else doing it. Now I know Beyonce is not a safe CD buy I won't be buying any more of anything with her name on it. This is why the music industry has gone down not because of bootleg CD but people don't want to buy music with negative aura. Even though there are some very talent music makers out there."
2,beyonce star is falling,"beyonce didn,t so well this time beyonce music sucks this cd why she made it this is a exmaple of how bad music these days artists like beyonce have a popluar image i saw beyonce win gramanys five of them but her music. her music is bad in the 90,s a artist could leave a comeback CHER is a great exmaple for a artist who start in the early 70,s and lasted to thought the 80,s in 90,s she made a minor comeback but she made better music than this i care more about good music then win gramanys or record sells . india didn,t win any gramanys but she has great music sade didn,t have a light shine on her but she made great music . Awful how you have poplaur image and make awful music that the same time is beyond me(India arie sharkia ) are better go buy their cds NOW this cd is sucks ."
5,B' Day (Deluxe Edition),"I love this album. This CD is a hit just like her first album. She belts, sings, and pours out her heart on this album. This album is a celebration and a milestone. Soulfully deep, emotionally expanseive, musically far reaching and filled with banging beats,muscular rhythms and lyris that are mature, smart and flat out sexy. The sound of an artist raising the bar is this record. This album has been certified 3x Platinum."
5,B'Day (Deluxe Edition),I received the cd very fast; haven't listen to it yet but it appears to be in excellent condition as promised.
3,What a WASTE!!,"Too few songs, too few good songs at that. Just not up to par with what one would think Ms. Knowles can bring to the table, given previous releases. I'm sure it was rushed and hastily put together and if that's the case why bother push back the release date."
3,"Not her best, but a solid effort.","To be honest, Beyonce isn't one of my favorite female artist, but I must admit that B'DAY is a decent album. Because she's Beyonce, I'm sure her album would sell regardless of what people think. When I first listened this CD, I wasn't to impressed and I would have given a low rating, but after the second and third listen, I must say that there are songs that will grow on you eventually. In my opinion, I think there are certain songs where she's singing to loud or to forcefull. There's great production behind the songs, but there are some songs that sounds to much alike. My favorite tracks are SUGA MAMA and KITTY KAT. I would say that B'DAY isn't her best work, but it's enough to keep her fans wanting more."
1,Push-a-button musical production!,"This is a shameful CD. No real instrumentation at all. Lackinglyrically also. Beyonce's next hot CD will likely be the upcoming ""Dream Girls"" soundtrack. This one is a miss."
2,I'm just not impressed with B'Day!,"The cover of Beyonce's new ablum is great. Her weight lost and her hair styled on top of her head makes her look stunning. But after listening to B'Day several times, I'm extremely disappointed. The entire project sounds rushed and the choice of songs are a turnoff. Whatever happened to the songs that the catchy lryics that were easy to learn.I absolutely love Beyonce and I'm proud of her accompishments. But I think she should slow down and stop diluting herself. Now that she's so popular, she needs to ensure her future popularity. Let her not forget about her future. She should keep i mind what has happened to Dianna Ross, and others who started out like her. Where are they now and what are they doing?"
1,Buyer Beware---B'day is BS,"After her Dangerously in Love cd and the Deja Vu single, I thought this is going to be a great album. I wish to the store only to be highly disappointed. Has Beyonce's stardom gotten to her that she only can ofer her fans 10 songs upon wich 3 songs (ones being played on the radio) are of the only decent quality--*Deja Vu*Ring the Alarm*IrreplaceableMy suggestion is to purchase the singles or download your favorite songs to be burned. It's much cheaper and you don't have to waste time skipping through horrible filler songs.Sorry Beyonce you need to go back to letting her father have input in your production/songs because at least with him you produced quality cd's and songs. Goes to show that old Matthew was the real force behind Beyonce and Destiny Child and without him, it showing in your music."
1,Don't B-other (part 2),"I don't quite know to begin with my critique of this album so I'll keep it simple - spend your money on Rhianna's cd. This has got to be, given the hype and Beyonce's iconic status in modern R&B, the single most disappointing project of 2006. What a complete and unqualified mess and a significant fall-off from her debut effort. Swizz Beatz fingerprints are all over this tragedy so he must shoulder some of the blame, but B is slippin' big time here. I have barely listened to this nonsense and dont plan to. Don't be a sucka - look elsewhere, anywhere but here. This album presents a real opportunity for B's competitors - Rhianna, Ciara, et. al. - to close the gap on her and I hope they take advantage of it and teach her a hard lesson - that you cannot disrespect your fan base by producing something this absurd and expect to stay on top. C'mon now B - we know you are better than this."
2,WTF IS THIS???,"I was really giving Beyonce the benefit of a doubt,but as soon as I put this cd on I knew it was a big mistake,and I agree with others this album is horrible. =(...I really like Beyonce too,but thi is just shame,half of the time she is just screaming on this album.The only songs I like are Ring the alarm and Get me Bodied.Sorry Beyonce but this is no good."
2,you're kidding right?,"next time, beyonce should let her father stay involved with her work. dangerously in love was heads & shoulders above this trite garbage. the songwriting is terrible [and downright offensive at times....creole anyone?], the beats are terrible, and beyonce fails to showcase her best asset: her wonderful voice. instead, she screams her way through half the CD, leaving my ears weary by the end.it gets one star for the song Ring the Alarm and another one for the song Upgrade U. The rest of the CD is complete junk, and i'm ashamed that Beyonce had the nerve to release this crap for her fans. please save your money."
3,Wouldn't waste my money,"I went to Target to buy this album the day it came out. I was first disappointed that it only had 10 tracks, then after listening to the tracks I only liked 3 out of the 10.I'm a fan on Beyonce but this album really disappointed me. I hope she re-thinks her next album and puts out something fans would actually like to listen to.Don't believe the Hype this album is not banging. Its not something six months from now you will want to listen too again."
2,Sophmore Blues..It Happens,"Unfortunately the two weeks she spent on this album should have been longer. Unfortunately a lot of the beats are annoying, the words to the songs are somewhat boring. The format of the album is no good. I have to say the voice is definitely stronger but the lyrics are not her. She sounds like a woman who has to buy love to keep her man and on the other end a woman who will cut you up if you try to go near him. Tracks like upgrade you, BEyonce seems to play it off like she's a gangsta chick which doesn't work out and instead of originality you have beyonce, a well developed artist copying artists that dont sell close to half of what she does. On TV today she said originally there were 20 tracks for the album, then why in the world would she only give us 10. Tracks that i do like are kitty kat, upgrade u and irreplaceable. Be prepared to hear only two ballads, the rest of the songs are for the clubs. otherwise happy b day beyonce, at least you will get the sales you want."
1,Dont B'dumb and buy this album!,"Saying Beyatche' is overrated is an on the money statement. Her voice is about as painful to the ear as a police or an ambulance siren. Deja Vu, the first single is about as dead as the dancing in that bland video. Jay-z's verse was dull and forgettable like this single. Ring the Alarm is just as bad with Beyatche' doing her worst Kelis impression on the hook. Upgrade U is hot garbage plus another bad beat Swizz Beatz is too much. Also Jay-z's verse on this song is just as butt as his verse on Deja Vu/You call shots/ I call audibles/SIGH! Irreplaceable is the cheesy hoodrat anthem of the year and if I see another dude sing or bumping this song in his ride I am going to pull out all my dreads one by one! Kitty Kat is probably the only song on here that is somewhat decent but thats it. The rest of this album is trash. Call me a hater but it is what it is. This album is bootyhole! F*** this high class hoodrat!"
1,Oh Hell No!,"I'm sick of this girl!Take a break, B, take a damn break.Get married, go have kids with Jay-Z or something!How many freakin' singles/videos is she going to release?And NOW she's re-releasing B'Day?!She's overdoing it and needs to go away for at least two years.BTW, 'Ring The Alarm' is one of the ugliest songs I've ever heard in my life."
3,Not that bad,"Okay, it's no ""Dangerously In Love"", but it's still a decent album in its own right.1.Deja Vu 5/10 The only thing that makes me dislike this song is Jay-Z. Ya'll are not Ike & Tina!!2.Get Me Bodied 1/10 I'm from the south, but I hate Bounce music.3.Suga Mama 2/10 I don't like this one4.Upgrade U 9/10 I luv this song, but once again Jay-Z destroys it.5.Ring The Alarm 7/10 Look out Alex Forrest!6. Kitty Kat 10/10 It's so sexy & naughty, but in a tasteful way.7. Freakum Dress 3/10 I don't really care for this one8.Greenlight 8/10 This is a great party song plus it's catchy.9. Irreplaceable 10/10 To the left, To the left!!10.Resentment 1/10 I hate this song.11.Hidden Track:Listen 10/10 B's voice really shines on this lovely song."
5,i love good pop music,"and nowadays it is so rare. the re-release of this album is the best thus far this year. the additional songs are just what *b'day* needed to bring it up to the standards the world holds beyonce to. the original was fun, and i loved the songs for what they were--fun, pop songs, but the added ballads are so sweet and beautiful and truly make the album more well-rounded. well worth the re-release.it is also a treat hearing beyonce sing in spanish. sometimes her spanish pronunciation is better than her english--she takes to singing in the language that well.anyway, i <3 this album, and it is a part of my [non-rock] pop music favorites over the past few years along with *the emancipation of mimi* and *alright, then*.my favorites are flaws and all (best beyonce song ever!), get me bodied (love that louisiana shout-out!), freakum dress (teach the children!) and irreplaceable (had to grow on me, but, oh...once it did!)"
3,"Deja Vu, Indeed.","""B'Day,"" the second long player from Miss Knowles, gives you everything you could expect from a Beyonce record and positively nothing more. That's not necessarily a bad thing, mind you. As CDs of this sort go, ""B'Day"" does what it aims to do admirably: deliver a solid package of trendy hip hop-flavored r&b that the kids will gobble up with ease. On a few tracks, lyrically and musically, Beyonce's second CD pulsates with an aggression that we didn't find in her 2003 CD ""Dangerously in Love."" (This can be evidenced in tracks like ""Ring the Alarm"" and ""Freakum Dress"") Beyond that, however, ""B'Day"" breaks little ground and often repeats itself, as shown on the kickoff track ""Deja Vu,"" which sounds like a not-too-distant cousin of ""Krazy in Luv."" When Miss Knowles finds the courage to take bold risks and rock her comfort zone, she'll then be capable of delivering the knockout CD we expect from her. Until then, the multiplatinum discs continue."
5,This is a celebration of her B'Day!,"Beyonce is an amazing singer, and her latest release ""B'Day"" is a HIT!!! Beyonce's stand out songs are ""Deja Vu"", ""Get Me Bodied"", ""Suga Mama"", ""Kitty Kat"", and ""Listen"". But for the rest of the album it is truly an amazing album. One thing you'll love about this CD is that they actually use live and real instruments, instead of digital beats; this music really gets you moving!"
4,not her best BUT still hot,"I like this ablum a lot. It is not as good as her last album ""Dangerously in Love"" but still hot. I am a true Beyonce fan. Anyone who says this woman is not talented does not know R&B music. My favorite song on the album is ""Resentment"". She is differently the best female R&B songress of the past 5 years. I completely identify with her lyrics. Anyone who say she can not sing must not have heard her live. Her voice is distinctive and strong."
4,"1/2 stars--Edgy, Experimental, Brash and Bold","Recorded in two weeks, B-DAY is Beyonce's ""Dirty Mind"". Like that classic Prince album, the music and vocal performances on Ms. B's second solo disc are raw, uncompromising, and fun. On ""Ring The Alarm"", Beyonce lets the mascara run down her face as she gets aggressive with a cheating man, while ""Irreplaceable"" and ""Resentment"" recall classic Aretha. Although ""Deja Vu"" isn't the strongest leadoff single in the world, it's charming due to the great 70's-like chord changes and the nice horn arrangement. The album's lone official sexy ballad ""Kitty Kat"" is well-produced by the Neptunes while the hidden track ""Listen"" serves as a great preview to Beyonce's upcoming star turn in the DREAMGIRLS film.Due to its experimental elements, B'DAY is an album meant to be absorbed after many repeated listenings. It's rare to find an album these days that you have to really dig deep to find even more treasures."
1,THIS WOMAN IS AN OVERKILL,"Like the reviewer said, how many videos is she going to release? Now she's re-releasing the same album??? This woman is just average and she's only getting all attention because the way she looks and dress. She oversings, she can't dance,her voice is average. This album is a hot mess. The lyrics are lacking, the music is awful. She tries so hard to be sexy and dress half naked on stage so you will forget about her awful music. I'm a guy and i consider this woman not classy but trashy. If you have talent, you don't have to act this way. When you don't have talent, you have to dress like a slut, scream and dance on stage like you're doing something and people will buy your music. American music is just sad, and it's not getting any better. I wish Jennifer from dreamgirls come out with an album and vanish this annoying screamer. At least Jennifer has class and true talent. Go Away beyonce!!"
1,Is it 2001 or 2006?,"Because this sounds like Glitter the soundtrack re-done by Beyonce! Or did she just pull a Glitter part II: B-Day. This dumb album should have been called MAY-DAY!!! Why does she have like 4 or 5 song out right now? I mean why? People are just in love with her looks not her music trust me, for this to be a hit album she must have gave some good h**d!!!"
2,Maybe Next Time Bey,"i expected more from bey with this album, all the songs sound the same, shes doing a lot of yelling on almost every song and theres no balance whatsoever. maybe next time bey, i know you can do a lot better than this."
1,Bad,"I am not feeling any of the tracks on this album. I feel like 'Deja Vu' is unlistenable because she's screaming the whole time. Ring the Alarm is okay but the alarm part is annoying and shes yelling again. Got Me Bodied what that makes no sense and the yo yo yo in the backround is so corny. I really hate Suga Mama. I don't even want to discuss it.Upgrade U is the new independant woman song. I hate it. Kitty Kat, I think shes trying to do a down south thing and I'm not feeling it. Freakum Dress is just retarded! Green light, go go go go away! How annoying. Irreplacable would have been good if she put the words made sense. I could have another you in a minute? what? Resentment is the only song I could listen to with out shuddering. Bonus tracks aint nothing cause its all the same. Extended mixes and what not. Boring. This album sucks."
1,Is everyone here deaf?,"Just looking at the cover of this album lets you know of the horrible insipid dreck inside. B'day is a perfect name as that is the french word for the plumbing that cleans your backside. The picture of her looks like Faust collected early on her soul. Oh my lord, this is the worst music imaginable. She just wails into the microphone instead of singing. Singing loud and high doesn't necessarily make you a singer. Jay Z also has you sheep fooled. Simply repeating your rap name and saying words like flow and go...... Someday the public is going to wake up to the fact that most rappers are talentless and soul less idiots who aren't motivated enough to learn an instrument and write songs of their own. When I hear songs off this album I just want to poke my eardrums out. Please quit buying this garbage so it will go away!!!"
3,"Edgier, More Aggressive Album","This is a big change from Beyonce's first album. This album is edgier and more aggressive. My favorite song is Upgrade You, which also features Jay-Z. I really hope that this song is released next. The rest of the cd was okay for me. I felt like Beyonce was screaming on some songs that seemed to be out of her vocal range. Overall, it was a decent effort."
4,B-day is grade A,I got her cd simply for that fact that I like beyonce and her last cd did really well. This cd has actually been in rotation in my car since it came out (until Tamia's new one dropped). I actually like it but we all know that most of the cd is about Jay-Z ex. 1. she had to UPGRADE him 2. she had to RING THE ALARM 3. then IRREPLACEABLE 4. now she has RESENTMENT. But all in all the cd is good especially the club jumpn GET ME BODIED(THE EXTENDED VERSION) that one right there is hot cuz it GET'S ME BODIED.
2,B'day-Beyoncé,"Very disappointing, I can appreciate her stepping out on her own, but the music isn't for me! I purchased before hearing, never again for a younger and marginal singer! Still a Fan of hers! The first solo Cd, mostly every cut was good, what happened ""B""?"
1,Horrible CD,"What the heck was she thinking? Dangerously in Love is a Classic, but this BDAY is a step back. Sorry Beyonce. Telling women to get a Frekum dress when he does wrong is why HIV is steadily rising in black america."
2,Ring the Alarm: Beyond Say it ain't So,"I'm not the biggest Beyonce fan but i do give credit where credit is due.......I honestly must say this CD is the most DISAPPOINTING music she has ever put together. I carefully, listened to the entired CD twice and only came up with only 2 songs that i care for . 1. is of course Deja Vu which is a definite sure winner. anything with Jigga in it has to be top notch. 2. Get me Bodied which has a nice groove to it and has the potential of being released as a single. Unfortunately, thats where i come to a complete hault. Ring the Alarm has some possiblities because of the hot beat....just can't get pass all that screaming. So to sum this CD up is to say sorry Beyonce. Get back into the studio and give us what you've been giving us for years. (That Fire)"
1,Waste of time and money,"Beyonce, now I'm not saying that you shouldn't experiment with different styles, but c'mon!!! Some things just aren't suited for you! I hate ""Ring the Alarm""! All you do is yell on this song! Instead of trying to keep up with someone else I know that has a brand new slammin album out now, you should taken out more time to write some decent songs. None of your lyrics are making sense on this album. You have to do better next time or better yet...just stop recording if can't seem to pull yourself together."
1,B has lost her damn mind!,"I am extremely disappointed in her sophomore album. I only liked 3 songs: De Ja Vu, Ring the Alarm & Upgrade U. She could have kept Kitty Kat, Suga Mama and everything else.She said she snuck into the studio to record this album and that's exactly what it sounds like. It's extremely rushed and not her at all. The only feel of her that you get is on the 3 songs listed above: De Ja Vu, Ring the Alarm & Upgrade U.I will not be checking out the World tour unless she throws in the songs from the Dangerously in Love.Save your money."
3,I like it,"Not one of those blow you away albums, but still good and worth adding to your collection."
3,I was expecting a bit more...,"It's not a bad CD, but based on the songs that were released I was just expecting a better album.she does have a great voice and as a Spanish speaker really enjoy hearing her sing in Spanish. Her accent is wonderful.buy this one, but you don't have to rush."
2,review,"the album was okay, it was not extroadinary like I thought Beyonce would do but 4 of the songs were on point with me. It depends on your taste in music as to whether you would purchace this album yourself"
3,I was expecting more,"Beyonce is known for pushing the envelope, either negative or positive. However, as a sophomore album, I was expecting so much more.In her debut album, there was more innovation. Most of these songs on the new album are very similar musically. And it seems they are all about an angry girlfriend who just broke up. That's a bit strange. I loved her love songs and club songs better.Honestly, the only song that has Beyonce potential is Ring the Alarm. The other songs were a but bland. She has so much to offer. I wasn't impressed this time. Maybe later but I'm waiting for her third album. Maybe she did that on purpose for wow factor..."
5,INCREDIBLE ALBUM,"when i first heard deja vu, i was a little iffy about this album. it didnt have a nice ""beyonce-vibe"" to it. i purchased this cd today however, and let me tell you, it is INCREDIBLE.i admire her so much for just stepping outside the box and creating music thats completely different than anything else out there. each song is very versatile and there are no two beats/rhythms that are the same.the standout songs are definitely GREEN LIGHT, SUGA MAMA, RING THE ALARM, KITTY KAT, UPGRADE U, and FREAKUM DRESS. but theyre all good!buy the cd, and see for yourself. you wont be disappointed"
1,Screech,"What happened? I enjoy Beyonce's powerful voice where the ""power"" is in the buildup of the song. This cd is screaming not singing! Disappointing. I only like the two singles Deja vu and Irreplaceable. I hope her next cd is better, a little closer to the first solo release please. I'm still a fan but will not buy her next cd without hearing it first."
3,NOT the same audio sound as the original B'day CD,"I got this version ""Beyonce B'Day Deluxe Edition"" as an IMPORT because I was trying to get what had been mentioned in another review -- the explanation for foreign audiences, in particular Japan, of many of the lyrics. But not even the lyrics are included in this version, and it was so hastily thrown together that the audio CD keeps falling out of the case because the teeth gripping it are so shoddy. The DVD is within the flip casing and so doesn't have that problem. I am very glad to get the videos -- they are fantastic. BUT the sound on the CD is awful!!! It's thin and not nearly the acoustic experience of the original B'Day CD. So, if you really want the music, especially for IRREPLACEABLE say, then get the original CD and have the great sound and the lyrics. Additional songs on this one are not worth it."
3,Fun for a girls night out,"While the lyrics to some tracks (like ""Freakum Dress"") are downright laughable, about 2/3 of the CD is a great up-tempo mix of dance hits and Dream Girls shout outs."
3,It's Ooookay but...,"This CD was a big disappointment to me. Going from her first CD to this one is like night and day. B-Day barely has any of the slow jams that I've grown to love from Beyonce. It is more so a hip-hop CD rather than R&B.; It also seems like she strayed away from what made her who she is, a good, solid, soulful songstress and is trying to reach a different audience. Now don't get me wrong, THE GIRL CAN BLOW, but this album seemed to be missing something.Other than that, I am still a huge Beyonce fan and will continue to support and buy her music!"
2,Not so good........,Felt kind of bad when I heard that Beyonce' considered this to be her best work... because it's not.
1,Omg i am VERY disappointed,"Beyonce just need to stay with jay-z and keep quiet. All the song sounds the same. she need to stop worrying about an 18 year old taking her bf and write some better music. If she is getting paid to come out with cd that is not worth listening to, i can write some dumb songs and make a cd too. I threw her cd in the garbage. none of my friends wanted it. Very disappointed. If her cd goes platinum that means jay-z bought all of them. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON BEYONCE'S CD. YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,why????,"i am an honestly big fan of beyonce. i have both of her cds and have always loved destiny's child. i even love her new song ""beautiful liar"". but i think that it is illogical for her to re-release this album, escpecially since releasing it in april defeats the purpose of naming the album ""Bday"" because her birthday is in september. but still, i can't help but love her new song. and i think that she did a great job with shakira. it is an unlikely collabo between two of the most successful artists of the decade, which makes it a great song. but shakira totally steals the spotlight with her stronger voice. i think this track should belong to shakira and she could use it as one of her tracks for her next album."
1,Nothing new,"There is nothing fresh, new or original about this CD. It's the same-old-same-old. It would be nice to hear her sing instead of just see how loud she can be. The content of the songs is, again, nothing new. Here, I'll sum it up with the chorus to one of the tracks:""You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me...""That's the best you can come up with? I think I'll pass."
1,THIS WOMAN IS AN OVERKILL,"Like the reviewer said, how many videos is she going to release? Now she's re-releasing the same album??? This woman is just average and she's only getting all attention because the way she looks and dress. She oversings, she can't dance,her voice is average. This album is a hot mess. The lyrics are lacking, the music is awful. She tries so hard to be sexy and dress half naked on stage so you will forget about her awful music. I'm a guy and i consider this woman not classy but trashy. If you have talent, you don't have to act this way. When you don't have talent, you have to dress like a [...], scream and dance on stage like you're doing something and people will buy your music. American music is just sad, and it's not getting any better. I wish Jennifer from dreamgirls come out with an album and vanish this annoying screamer. At least Jennifer has class and true talent. Go Away beyonce!!"
1,horrible!,"I heard deja vu and thought this was going to be a fabulous record cause that was one of the best r&b/dance grooves to have come out in such a long time. Aside from Ring the Alarm and Green Light, this album is very disappointing and not representative of her talent for singing and songwriting at all. She needs to hook up with someone like clive davis who can guide her in the right direction musically if she wants to have longeivity."
3,"Not buying it, but I'm impressed","None of the few new songs on here make me want to buy the album, but they're all decent. My jams are still ""Upgrade U"" and ""Kitty Kat"" (minus when she decides to rap--oh how I wish she would NEVER EVER do that again). I also like ""Irreplaceable,"" ""Ring the Alarm,"" and ""Get Me Bodied."" But those were on the original album. I can definitely tell in this version her and SOMEBODY made up. I love how he was replaceable on the last album, but on this one she talks about all of her faults and how in love she is. This album should be called ""Second Chance."" But anyway, I am impressed with her Spanish. After studying it for eight years and constantly having to concentrate on accents, I felt that she did a great job with the Spanish part. I don't know how natives will feel about it, but I'll be checking the reviews to see."
5,It's a celebration!,"This is an upgrade of Beyonce's debut ""Dangerously In Love"". The new album B'Day, which feature the hit songs ""Deja Vu"", ""Ring The Alarm"", ""Irreplaceable"", and ""Upgrade U"". There is no doubt that this is by far B's best work. It features live instruments like no other R&B/Hip-Hop artist is doing these days. She is so unique and soulful. Give this album a chance, I did and loved it!!!"
2,Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love Beyonce! I think that she is very talented, an excellent performer and also beautiful. I waited for this album with anticiapation and I knew that it would be ""ALL THAT"". But instead of ""ALL THAT "" I got ""GARBAGE"". This is a terrible CD and she could have done much better.Even the title of her songs are soooooo out of her character and ghetto! Don't get me wrong I think it is a good idea to switch up and give women something we can dance to and anthem women empowerment songs, however her entire album doesn't reflect her voice vocally!It seems to me like something you have to listen to over and over again to make yourself like it since you spent your money on it.I would say get it on BOOTLEG ""10 SONGS"". Before you know it you're back at number one and feeling very disappointed.DO BETTER NEXT TIME!"
5,Beyonce Plus Plus Plus,What could be better than Beyonce? Beyonce plus Shakira plus Alejandro Fernandez. Bravo.
3,Not her best.,"She's definitely done better then B'day. If she would have spent a little more time developing the album, it would have come out a lot better then it did. Two weeks isn't enough. But you always have the Deluxe Edition to look forward to."
2,Hated It!!!,I did not enjoy this CD as a whole. I felt it could have been better -- sounds like she rushed to get it out. I would NOT recommend this.
2,What is the theme of this mess?,"Ok the CD is horrible. In the words of the chourus from track 6---I am not feeling it. Instead of paying $13.98 at Walmart, I wish I would have saved 10 bucks and got a boot leg copy for $3. All of the tracks except irreplaceable are fast. This is nothing like Dangerously in Love. The CD is only selling because of the over exposure of Beyonce and not the quality of the CD--- 10 songs and only about 3 are worth listening to including ring the alarm. Let's just hope Kelly Rowland makes something better. Save your money---go get Janet CD or LeToya."
2,disappointment,I wasn't impressed with the first CD so I thought that this effort would be better....WRONG. I only liked 3 songs and I will probably get someone to burn those onto a CD for me and call it a day. In my opinion this CD is not worth the money.
1,Not Ms. Knowles,"Beyonce Who? This was probably the worst cd I have bought in a long time. I was expecting B. to top her last album but she flopped and flopped hard. Between her and Letoya, there is no question who had the best CD. The only song worth listening to on the CD is ""Resentment"" its the only song that shows her vocal ability and takes you back to the B. we all know. Almost every song on the CD talks about her and Jay Z, I mean we get the point, he cheated let it burn baby. The ""Get it Bodied Remix"" is a half way decent song but only when she breaks it down does it become hella hot. If I could I would write B a letter and tell her to give me my money back and to try again cause overall this CD is horrible."
2,the title of this album should be cocky n horny,what the he**. This CD is on another level. For one 10 songs..The only good song to me is dejavu. I guess beyonce is trying to shed her good girl image. Well she succeeded with that atleast. This CD is the reason people bootleg. They just don't make em' like they used to.......
3,Of The Moment,"Will we honestly be jamming to this album in 10 years? I think not! However B'Day is formatted very much like recent albums from Amerie (Touch) and Christina Milian (So Amazin'). Each album is formatted simliarly that it contains a majority of uptempo tracks with one or two ballads placed at the end. This album (as you have probably already read) is by no means Dangerously In Love Part 2. I think that's what a lot of people were expecting. I think a lot of people will also agree Beyonce has time to grow. An experimental album such as B'Day could wait for many. Beyonce traded in her sultry pop sound in favor of Tina Turner's aggressiveness. Maybe this album will also be the beginning of Beyonce never sticking to the same formula. Perhaps a Madonna like chamelon? Anyway the album is hot! The beats, productions, lyrics (fun and somewhat immature) make the album. Beyonce's vocals are thrilling but can be annoying to some.My personal highlights:Freekum DressIrreplaceableDeja Vu"
1,Don't Buy,She is YELLING not singing and only 10 tracks . It was a waste of my money. Not to mention the songs suck (all but three). Beyonce I think you need to get a pen and pad and get back to lab cause this CD was not the buisness
2,"Love Beyonce, Hate this CD","I'm a big Beyonce fan and will defend her in the face of the enormous hateration she's experiencing lately, BUT this CD did nothing for me. She's no doubt a good singer, but she seems to be screaming on many of the ""songs"" here. The vibe is way too hardcore for my taste. 'Deja Vu' and 'Suga Mama' are the only cuts I can tolerate. I don't know how much Jay-Z had to do with this album, but these tracks seem to be more suited to a rapper than a singer. It's more noisy than musical. Still love ya, Bey, but I can't get with B'Day."
1,This album SUCKS!!,"I would usually recommend an album if it has at least three likeable songs on it but I can only tolerate two of them Deja' Vu & Kitty Kat. I know that I shouldn't compare this to her Dangerously in Love album but I can't help it, I will never buy another one of her albums without first previewing it, I could have saved myself $9.99 before tax!! I'd gladly buy 50 of Justin Timberlake's new album and give them away than to have wasted my hard earned dollars on this mediocre bull!! I'll just have to keep listening to her first album and Destiny's Child albums if I want to hear a few decent songs by her. A very disappointed semi-fan."
2,HUGE Disappointment....,"I purchased this album based solely on my LOVE for Beyonce and the success of her pervious solo album. B-Day is a total let down, I was expecting so much more. I can appreciate B for her ""out-the-box"" ingenious mind; however, I can tell that this album was rushed. I don't see any Grammy's in her near future based on the limited radio play of her singles and the mediocre album as a whole."
3,I literally waited for nothing!,"I was actually looking forward to her cd! I was extremely disappointed. First of all there are only 10 songs! Half the cd I like, the bonus cd tracks suck! 'Get me Bodied' the extended version has too much going on. I don't like how she used an Amerie beat on 'Freakum Dress', which is probably a sample from some where else. The beat on 'Green Light' sound like a slowed down version of Nelly's 'Hot in Here.' Beyonce is pulling an Ashanti by putting out anything! Every review I read keep saying she's doing something different, I'm not hearing it!"
1,What a waste.,"This cd sounds like a bunch of filler. She shouts on half the tracks, and you can tell she only took 2 weeks to make this trash. I want my money back."
2,Sophomore slump,"I have always loved Beyonce's music, whether she was with Destiny's Child or flying solo. She is a very talented songwriter and producer. However, ""B-Day"" lacks creativity, depth, and variety. It's not Beyonce's different approach to music that's bad, it's that every song sounds alike. The only standout songs on this album are ""Deja Vu"", ""Upgrade You"", ""Ring The Alarm"" and ""Irreplaceable"". Alot of the songs sound like ""Ring The Alarm""; a lot of screaming and yelling with a big dose of fiestiness. The one thing ""B-day"" has that her debut album ""Dangerously In Love"" didn't, is more upbeat songs. But these songs are missing good hooks and better lyrics. These lyrics are not as mature as Beyonce's previous hits ""Independent Women"" and ""Survivor"". These songs are something one would expect on her early Destiny's Child work. There is absolutely no development on ""B-Day"", nor depth. Beyonce still has the talent, she just picked mediocre songs for her sophomore effort."
2,should have taken longer,"I am a Beyonce fan. Not a Beyonce apologist like many seem to be. I guess for some as long as she shows up, they will swear its good. because basicaly thats all she did on here was show up- maybe. while many singers have to hide their voice behind production, Beyonce doesnt have to. which makes her over produced songs even worse. ssorry, but this CD was a major dissapointment. It is the worst CD she has been associated with."
1,Disappointed,"Bday is such a disappointment. Intially when I listened to the cd I thought ok its not as catchy as Dangerously in Love it is just going to have to grow on me, but that was not the case. I have given this cd several chances but it is just not working. First, it is only ten songs with a bonus track that doesn't help the Cd out at all. Second, the songs seem a little off even on the ""ballad"" Resentment the quality of her voice is awful. I don't even know what the direction of this cd is it just seems all over the place. To sum it up I can tell that this cd was made in two weeks the quality just sucks I wish I would have saved my money!!"
5,A scorcher of an album!!!,"'Crazy In Love' should have been on this album, because this is one of the hottest, club-ready and scorching albums I have ever heard (second only to Madonna's 'Confessions On A Dancefloor). Right from De jaVa, to the heart-pounding 'Ring the Alarm', you will literally feel your walls shake, and your body will begin to do things you didn't know it could.Honestly, this is really that good!! Beyonce had ditched the sloppy ballads, and gone for a tighter more structured sound, and the results are astounding. No fillers here, just some of the hottest music around!!"
2,B's B'Day recorded over a series of BAD DAYS,"LOOK, I love Beyonc'e and thought she could do no wrong-I was living in deception.The beats on this album are really great,she dosn't sound great, but she dosn't sound too bad either. What the hell happened??? The album was SUCH a dissapointment!!! I really regret buying this-if she really only spent 3 weeks working on this then I think she is a tad disrespectfull to the fans. When people say things like ""she could sing the newspaper to me and Id love it!!!"" they don't really mean it. B obviously thinks that she is so good that she don't need to strive for greatness and masses will still buy the damn thing! Well miss B...You go right ahead and keep thinkin you've got it like that...but I'm gon get my refund-do ya feel me?"
2,Say What!,"I bought this CD as I do alot of other music. I'm a truck driver so all I do is listen to music all day everyday. This cd was not a good buy. It's like jump up....no sit down, sorta like a high energy club and then a boring club at the same time. I ended up listening to one song all the way through and then taking the cd out of the player and I haven't played it since! I won't be buying anymore of her music.....If you know what I mean!"
4,Good,"I really recommend this CD. It's not really my kind of music, but after listening to a few of Beyonce's songs, I looked at music with a slightly different perspective.R&B; has never been quite like this...My favorite song on this album is most probably ""Deja Vu"". The lyrics and beat are catchy, and Beyonce ACTUALLY has a good voice. She is much better as a solo artist rather than with Destiny's Child.Anyway, THUMBS UP! Buy it and you'll be doing good for your ears."
5,Straight from a real Beyonce' fan,"This cd is hot! Dangerously in Love was different but, this cd couldn't be totally the same. It's different but it's still B. This album represents for all the ladies who are struggling with saying exactly how they feel about relationships. All of her songs put it out there when you know your man is acting up you put yo freakum dress on and make him sweat, and when yo man is the BOMB!!! of course you want to give him everything cause he giving it to you so you are his sugga mama. You have to listen to this and not compare it to Dangerously in Love b/c its a different time in her life, just like the rest of us she has to find a way to express herself. She might just want to vent a little about Jay cus all guys are a trip. For all we know Jay may not be her only guy!!! think about that!!!!!!!!!!"
4,This was worth re-getting,"Normally, I am against buy re-releases. Usually, all we get are 2-4 new songs or a bonus dvd. For example, Usher's ""Confessions"" was a crappy re-release with only 4 extra songs. I have to make an exception with this re-release of ""B'day"" (I've been meaning to buy it on cd anyways since my original copy is a gift on Vinyl LP Record). With it's 11 new songs, this re-release is practically a whole new album. My only problem with this re-release is that ""Back Up"" (which was on the original release at Circuit City stores) is not on it."
3,A Little Disappointed in B-Day,"I think that Beyonce is a very beautiful and multi talented person. She has a beautiful, powerful voice. However, I think that she should have taken more than 2 weeks to do this album. I am a true fan, but I must admit that I was quite disappointed with this album. Ring the Alarm, Upgrade U, Get Me Bodied, and Kitty Kat are the best songs on the album. If you are going to put only 10 songs on the album, you should make sure that at least 8 of the ten songs are great. If this is the direction she is going in, then she may not be a show stopper for long. I rushed out to buy this album, but I certainly won't do that next time."
3,Don't hate it but sure don't love it either. Wish it was better.,"I think based on the reviews you will read here you'll see this CD really is a matter of personnal taste. I do suggest buyers listen to the 30 sec music clips because if I had of done that I sure would NOT have bought this CD at full price. There are only a few songs I liked .....ie Ring the Alarm, Resentment,Irreplaceable and Upgrade the rest is a mesh mash mess IMHO. I personally REALLY REALLY HATED Suga Mama, Kitty Kat, Green Light and Get Me Bodied. I also agree with several posters who stated there was WAY to much Jay-Z. I hope the next CD is better."
3,An okay second effort from an overated artist,"I really am not a Beyonce fan so maybe this may seem a little biased. First off I think she is overated, she can sing and dance but there are others out there who can do it just as well or even better. I listened to this album and to me it is like lukewarm water. I liked her first album better than this one. I just didn't get the album...it sounds rushed and she is basically using other artist's formulas (such as Kelis) and it doesn't work for her. The only songs that stood out to me was Upgrade you and Get me Bodied...and that is strictly because of beats. Her lyrics are not as strong on this album as the first. I just think that if she put a little more effort into this project, it could have been a little more well recieved."
4,not bad,"i didn't think this cd was all that bad, i like it. i'm not a big fan, but i like listening to it."
3,ok,A tad disappointing. I understand she may have tried to do something new but it didn't work. There were too few songs on the CD and too many singles! Not her best work. I know she can do better.
4,"""B'Day"" is a pretty good effort...","Beyonce's ""B'Day"" is a big improvement from ""Dangerously in Love"". I didn't like her first album very much, but this was better. But, there are still some things that annoy me. Here are my ratings.1. Deja Vu - this song didn't become that popular, but I love it!2. Get Me Bodied - one of the better songs. cool beat.3. Suga Mama - another one of the better songs.4. upgrade u - very forgettable. pretty good i guess.5. ring the alarm - this became popular and i love it!6. kitty kat - the one song i can't stand from the album.7. freakum dress - great dance song.8. green light - forgettable, but good.9. irreplaceable - another popular track that i really like. one of the top 310. resentment - very nice ballad. i like the guitar.Encore for the Fans-* Listen - she just made a music video fr this song. it is absolutely amazing.* Get me Bodied (extended Mix) - same as get me bodied but just 2 extra minutes.Overall, pretty good album."
3,"Disappointing, but she's still the sh@%!!.","This cd is very different. It kind of has the vibe of DC's Survivor. Like shes trying to do something different,but it does and it doesn't work.This cd sounds like a bunch of filler songs with no standout tracks.What was the rush?As great as she is the fans would have waited.I expected some growth on this cd,but there is none. Am I the only one that is sick of hearing Jayz on Beyonce songs? And what is he talking about? And why is there only 10 songs on this disc. Beyonce I love you but you could of done better,please do better on next disc.Best Songs:Suga Momma-LOVE this song!!Ring the AlarmKitty Kat-LOVE this song!!Freakum dressGreen light-LOVE this song!!Irreplacable"
2,Complete Garbage!,"I am very disappointed with this effort from beyonce. She screams on the whole CD, and there is only 3 good tracks. I wish I hadn't of bought it.Don't waste your time on this CD."
2,The Calling...NOT!!!,Ms.Reeves has a quality voice but her delivery is not to my liking. I am more into the Diana Krall presentation.
3,Comprehensive but hard reading,"This book is a comprehensive survey of the historical development of Protestant Worship. However, White is not content with using words demanding medium cognitive effort; rather he opted to put in place arduous words where an unadorned word would prove sufficient. Another disappointment is that there is no picture at all in the book to illustrate the many graphical descriptions of various church architectures. He obviously did not hold to the view ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" but rather took the exact opposite view. The above two factors combine to make the reading of this book taking twice as much time as it should."
5,Great CD,I have other recordings by this artist and wanted more and was glad to find one. Good background listening music. Very relaxing.
1,"Gives ""tripe"" a bad name.",Drivel like this should be deemed illegal by law. Steven King should be ashamed of himself for producing ANYTHING that makes Armaggedon look good in comparison.
5,80s movies,i have looked for this movie for a long time i find the movies i want on this website i will continue to come back and order other movies and other things that i want and cant find any where else
2,KEEP ON TRUCKIN KING,"Writer Stephen King jumped into the director's chair in this basically silly venture into the macabre. MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE suffers from too much of the same thing; a pretty bad cast except for the delightful Yeardley Smith as a whiny newlywed; amateurish special effects and plot holes a mile deep. To King's credit, he has some pretty outlandish sequences, including a bloodbath at a little league game. Emilio Estevez, Pat Hingle and Laura Harrington are some of the actors lost in ill-conceived roles, and the suspense dies early. Aiming for schlock effects and gore, this movie is not one of King's high points and is viewed merely as a kind of ""cult"" classic in those cheesey B movies."
1,Maximum Stupidity,What the hell was Stephen King thinking?!. This movie shows that Mr. King should stick only to writing. This film is a joke and a stinker in every sense of the word. One of the worst ever!!!!.
2,Maximum Failure!,"One of the worst Stephen King movies ever made and one of the worst premises for a horror film. Predictable and pointless plot make this movie dull, static, and easily forgettable. The opening ""machines attacking"" scenes have almost nothing to do with the rest of the movie, which deals mainly with trucks driving around aimlessly. Acting is bad: Why doesn't anybody ever see the machines coming? What is with the ending? Will going on a boat actually solve the ""machine problem""? I definitely don't recommend this movie. It's hardly scary, just aggravating and mindless!"
1,cheesy..only cool thing is the Music and Trucks.,"Cheesy Movie(Maxium Overdrive AKA Trucks!) ,Cheesy Acting,But a Great AC/DC soundtrack and some cool Big Rigs."
5,Classic Stephan King movie,"I liked this movie for it's ""classic"" quality that it delivers in the horror genre. I thought that it was very well done for the 80s and is also a classic of the 80s as well. I had always wanted to see this movie but never got the chance until now. I am very glad that I did and I also added it to my horror collections as well. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes the ""classic"" horror flicks of the 80s."
4,Emilio!!!,"Haha, Cheesy but i enjoyed the story line and the mighty ducks coach becomes a bad ass in this classic 80's horror film based on trucks trapping folks in a gas station, Gotta love the 80's."
3,Ehh,Movie was better first time i seen it a long while ago. Its just cant satisfy like say the new Avengers movie. Dug it.Shipping was nice.
4,Another good flick,I have watched this movie a few times finally got it on dvd to add to my collection
3,Maximum Overdrive,"This is a decent Stephen King story and the music is certainly good with AC/DC rocking the air waves. The first time I saw this I wasn't as impressed but over the years this has actually aged well. The more I viewed it the more I appreciated that it is fun like the George Romero Undead movies. When a Alien controlled Comet's tail turns the sky green all the machines turn against humans. So anything from a electric carving knife to a Semi-Trailer Truck is deadly. The worst of all is a tractor-trailer with a big green goblin face on the front of the grill and toys in the back. Emilio Estevez and the rest the cast do a fine job making this horror come to life. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""The Thing"" (1982) and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004). - C. Luster"
1,Even Steven admits this movie blows.,"No joke, I've heard multiple tapes of events he's spoken at (as well as attended one) and he openly states this movie bites.Those rating 3, 4 or lm*o 5 stars are ""Fan Boys"".Don't get me wrong, I like S.King's stuff (It, Misery, Pet Sematary for example) but this one is to be avoided."
1,What a stifferoo!,Dreadful - even the actors looked embarrassed. The only part worth seeing was the swearing autoteller. Other directors of dogs like this have the sense to save themselves shame by hiding behind the Alan Smithee psuedonym - what a pity Mr. King didn't. Just awful.
4,Stephen King Classic,"Although a budget film, is one of the better Stephen King transfers to film. Emilio Estevez is good in the role and Yardley Smith is a hoot. This completes my collection of the early King movies. Recommended for just some good (sometimes gory) fun."
2,It was good until,This movie is considered one of the worst films of all time. Well the first half hour was pretty good and then it all went to hell from there. The newlywed couple were very annoying and the gerenade launcher was stupid. Pat Hingle puts on a great performance in a lackluster movie.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:If you go into Maximum Overdrive with the right frame of mind (basically don't expect anything intelligent) then you'll probably have as good a time as I did watching trucks with no drivers terrorize middle America; it's not good per se, but it's good trash."
2,"Oh, my aching head...","People who really like this movie are either diehard Emilio Estevez or AC/DC fans. But if it takes more than that to trip your trigger, you will not enjoy this movie. It is little more than a forum for creative ways in which machines can maim people and pop their heads like grapes. The gore is over the top. The acting is... well, let's just say that Emilio is the best one here. The dialogue is laugh-inducing.Indeed, there is a high camp factor in this movie. If you want to have a few drinks with your buddies and laugh yourselves into a coma, this flick will do the trick (that's why it got two stars). But if you want more out of a movie than children getting run over by steamrollers, you'd best stay away from this garbage."
