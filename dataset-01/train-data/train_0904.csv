1,Quite possibly....,"...the worst album I have ever heard in my entire life.I was a great fan of Michael Ball's when his career was focused on the musical stage, but his move (and subsequent albums) to the pop arena left me cold. As well as being a fan of musical theater, I also adore country music. So, when I found out that Michael Ball had made a ""country"" album, my curiosity was piqued.First of all, this is not country music. These are covers of songs originally recorded by country artists. This CD would not be considered country in Nashville, Minneapolis, Branson or even Vegas. The last, however, seems the most likely home for this CD. Gone is the simple and clear emotional renderings of the original artists. Instead, the sorry souls listening are subjected to over-orchestrated arrangements created, to my best guess, to hide the fact that Mr. Ball's once incredible range has all but disappeared and years of smoking and vocal misuse have wreaked havoc on his vocal chords."
4,"Michael, You've Done It Again!","After purchasing, and listening, to other CD's by Michael Ball, I can say this latest CD is just as good, if not better! Michael Ball has chosen some recent songs for this album, which I feel he needed to do now. I think that it is nice that there are a couple of country songs on this album, for Michaels US fans! One of them is called, If Tomorrow Never Comes, and there is also the song, The Dance, which was a hit for Garth Brooks. Michael sings these two songs very well, of course! I also like the song, You Bring the Best Out of Me.There are some other very nice songs included on this CD. You won't be dissapointed, by any means, in Michaels latest, This Time It's Personal, and if you really want to get up close and personal, buy the video, of the same name! It's great!"
4,Bleach the Best CD,Has some recognizable songs if you've streamed Bleach from the various websites out there. Does not contain the more recent espisodes theme songs.
5,Bleach really is the best,"okay, first and off subject, ignore my title for this, I couldn't think of a good one.The cd itself is amazing, not only for the fans of the anime, but for those who like the themes as well. I have to admit, they picked some pretty awesome songs for all themes.Unfortunately, I didn't get the DVD with my order (if it does have one), but I don't really care that much because I probably wouldn't have been able to play it in the first place and I ordered it for the CD itself anyway.I'm definately gonna try to buy the second cd to this which has even more songs to enjoy."
5,this soundtrack is amazing!!!,"I love this cd! It contains all the opening and ending themes from the anime, also it has a dvd of all the opening and ending videos plus a few pictures from it as well. My only complaint is that most american dvd players won't be able to play the dvd due to it being Japanese, but otherwise I absoulutly love the music and if you like any of the opening or ending themes to the show then this is the cd for you."
5,ADDICTED!,If you love even 1/2 of the opening or ending themes this is a great audio cd!! I bought myself & my lil sister one & we jam out to it still & it's been in our possession for several months! Recommended for ALL BLEACH lovers! Ichiruki!!
5,Action and humor!,"I really enjoyed this book! I normally don't like to read ""spy"" novels, but made an exception because of Hubbard and Anderson. I'm certainly glad that I did. There wasn't all that ""intelligence"" agency jargon that is the norm for novels like this. I'd definitely recommend this to others."
2,Martin Short as Indiana Jones,"Ok, I admit I'm a Kevin Anderson fan. I even had Amazon.com search high and low for his ""Assemblers of Infinity"" because he was between new book releases (and they found it).But my problem with this latest work is I went looking for Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and instead found Martin Short (or Leslie Neilson).This is a comedy, not one of Anderson's typical action-adventure tales. The main character repeatedly stumbles between cases of mistaken identity that, somehow work out in the end. If you read the book with this in mind it will be entertaining. If, however, you're looking for a Kevin Anderson book, look for ""Assemblers of Infinity.""-- David Hess"
2,OOPS,"This CD just didn't work for me. I thought ""Every Me, Every You"" was good, which I discovered on the Cruel Intentions Soundtrack. I had also heard ""Pure Morning"", and figured the album would be good. It was not. I am open to almost all music, except Rap, but this just didn't suite me."
2,One hit and not much worse.,"""Pure Morning"" is one of XM 43's better songs. Everything else here is only somewhat worse. All in all, they show a lot of promise in every area. Realisticly, they've got to improve to make a go of it."
2,"A dissenting vote by an uninspired, jaded listener","To cast a dissenting vote, I find this album to be a poor rehash of badly beaten horses. (That would be a metaphor, not an album.) The lyrics are weak; it feels as if words are chosen just so they rhyme. The lead singer tries to be creative by lengthening single syllable words into two syllables (it's a matter of tru-ust,"" but I just find it annoying and uninspired.If you find this at a used CD store for five bucks, it's worth it. That's about it."
2,A disappoinment,"I was seriously let down by this. I thought 'Pure Morning' was great, despite lead singer Brian Molko's grating vocals. Apart from Pure Morning there are really only two other good songs (Every you, every me' and 'The Crawl.' Listening to the whole album is a task, and listening to music should be enjoyable. This certainly is not. Think before you buy."
4,Just one masterpiece!,"Placebo. To me, it's one of those poor struggling little bands that never got famous. Most of the songs on this CD are rather dull. But wait... ""Pure Morning"" is gorgeous. I love it. I heard it on the radio one day, admired it, and then forgot about it, but my boyfriend remembered and later gave me the CD as a gift. ""Pure Morning"" has captivating slammin' rhythm, clever rhyme, and a singer with a sweet voice. This song makes me smile. The piece ""My Sweet Prince"" is soft, dreamy, and eerie, again due to its silver-tongued vocalist and unusual percussion. The other songs didn't really make an impression on me; they seemed more like padding for the one hit in the album. You're only paying for a song or two, but... enjoy!"
4,Not the best but pretty good,"The first Placebo song I've ever heard was ""Every Me And Every You"" on Cruel Intentions. So I decided to buy it. I wasn't expecting much from seeing that I only knew one song but ""Without you I'm nothing"" is a really good album. Now, to tell you the truth the slow songs are really not that great like ""The Crawl"". You're probbaly better off with some of the more catchy songs. Over all PLACEBO is a good album."
3,Without this record I`m far from nothing,"Hmm.I am a biggish fan of Placebo,and I was fairly happy with the new album,due to it`s better production than the other one.They are making some progress with their song writing,however some of the songs are so naff I felt a little disappointed.It`s not bad,though,and The Crawl is just so great,as is the title track."
5,Wow! This is my favorite CD...,"God. This is a CD you can't miss. Brian Molko has the most beautiful and purest voice I've ever heard. I had to listen to it a couple of times before I really started to like it, but now I listen to it every day. You really should buy it.Mon CD préféré. Brian Molko a une voix superbe. Les paroles sont bien, la musique est géniale et surtout très différente des chansons commerciales qu'on entend à la radio. Enfin, du changement."
4,Placebos 2nd album is a worthy addition...,"With their second album, Placebo prove that they get better and better. With Brian's helium-like vocals, the bands music is very original. The lyrics are often angry, hate-ridden and dirty, but humourous just the same."
5,placebo rules!!!!!!!!!,"My friend introduced me to this music from downloads she had on her computer. I thought right then I was in heaven. The music shows so much, and Brian has such a voice on him. This was such an exciting day to find another band that is as unusual as Placebo. I hope anyone stumbles across them like I did. I hope they keep making music."
4,Finally some straight talk!,"A breath of fresh air for the physically challenged/disabled. Yes, romance is possible. Yes, physical intimacy is possible - and not solely the province of the perfect. This book should be in the library of any professional care/health provider who works with the physically disabled/challenged."
4,A good resource with many gaps,"This is a great resource in a broad sense. I do understand that to cover all of the various sexuality issues within disability would require several books. However, it would have been nice to cover issues related to congenital disabilities, even just a little bit."
2,Visual people need not order,"This book was hopefully going to help our sex life with some variety. I have a bad SI/hip joint so I was excited about the prospect of new things to come. I was very disappointed when flipping through. I am a grown-up so I didn't need the Sex Ed class anatomy drawings. The few positions (6 I think) illustrated were like...DUH. There is allot of psycho-babble about the mental effects of disabilities, and education on STD's and other superfluous information. To call this the ""Ultimate Guide"" is not just stretching the truth, it's ludicrous. If you still struggle with accepting your disability and limitations, you might get something out of this. Otherwise, look elsewhere. Still trying to find a position book that doesn't require you to be a gymnast."
3,Good Stuff for practise,It is good in the sense that reviews every major system in medicine.But at the same time contains information not very relavant or important for the exam.Good if you have time but does not contain high yield material if you need a concise review.
5,As tood as I remember,This is as good as I remember. I remember where I was when I first heard this CD. Throaty. Not old-line twangy country.
5,Used CD,"Even though it took me a few weeks to listen to the CD, it was in good condition as described. So glad I was able to replace this particular CD. I had the tape but lost ALL my music in Hurricane Katrina and I am trying to rebuild my collection."
5,May does it again,"Julian May has a serious problem. She is such a wonderful writer, her plots, her style . . . . everything is at such a high level that her readers have come to expect nothing less than perfection from her. Certainly, I expected perfection when I began to read Sagitarius Whorl. I didn't find perfection, but nor did I find any thing less than pure enjoyment.This book, and the series as a whole, has everything that makes science fiction worthwhile. An intriguing plot with many twists and turns, a compelling yet not entirely sympathetic hero, sex, violence, and a vision of a humanity that continues to grow, mature, and slowly begins to eschew greed for humaneness and concern for the common weal.In some ways, this series is more accessible than the Pliocene and Galactic milieu epics, but it is no less compelling. Highly recommended."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Helly is back doing the corporate thing yet again, helping out his very rich family fight off an opponent, by putting his talents for dodgy and sneaky to good use.There is still the overaching threat of the aliens that he has to get people to realise and deal with. For this, he needs more proof, and this mission is the more important part of the story."
4,Shoes,I got the pink ones and wished I would have gone with blue. I think they run a little big. Other than that they are great and you can't beat the price! They list for $120 in the store.
3,An embarrassing blast from the past for Tibet,"There's a reason that David Tibet didn't rerelease this album for years--to put it bluntly, most of it sucks, but it has a kind of campy charm, though not enough to really rescue it. I'd only give it 2 stars, but there are a couple of decent or really humorous songs (""My Secret Gardnener"" and the campy theme song), and the cheesy 80's drum machines bring a smile to this aging new waver's face. Also, the liner notes are classic, especially reading about Tibet's pick up lines of the time (""Can I interest you in Death?"") I wouldn't say don't get it, but you've been warned."
2,Good graphic organizers,"One of my college teachers told us to order this book and really the only thing we did with it was use the graphic organizers in the back, which are really nice, but graphic organizers can easily be found online. If I could do it over again I would have saved myself the $26 I spent on it and used Google to find different graphic organizers. Overall, not really worth the money."
5,My new go-to book,This has become my new go-to book when I have a new text or concept to teach with the Common Core. Frequently I find strategies and graphic organizers that are TERRIFIC at engaging students interest and really helping them learn skills and concepts. Great for helping students think critically. I heard about this at a seminar on the new ELA Common Core. It was money well-spent.
5,A MUST for secondary teachers!,Outstanding work! Easy to follow steps for implementing strategies in the classroom. I recommend this book during each professional learning session I present!
5,Buy this book,This book is one of the best if you are looking to find strategies for teaching. I strongly recommend it to all teachers.
4,Great how-to book for therapy hypnosis,An outstanding reference for novice and professional hypnotists alike. This book has the most up-to-date techniques on hypnosis and includes several methods of induction and some very practical scripts for conducting hypnotherapy sessions ranging from weight-loss to stopping smoking to dealing phobias and traumatic experiences. It even covers getting individuals to recall blocked memories or increasing the level of detail recalled in memories. This is written from a very professional clinical perspective. Several tests and evaluations are also given to test what type of hypnosis your subject is most susceptible to.
5,Best Primer still available NEW from Hypnosis Motivation Institute,"First, the book is still available for sale NEW for 27.95 at the Hypnosis Motivation Institute, the school Dr Kappas founded in Tarzana. This book is not out of print or rare. However, it is a must have text for professional hypnotherapists. Dr Kappas' book contains information not found in any other hypnosis texts (unless Dr Kappas wrote them!) about subconscious behavior. Dr Kappas 'redefines our understanding of hypnosis and how it works with his ""Message Unit Theory of Hypnosis"", as well as introduces his revolutionary model of ""Emotional and Physical Suggestibility and Sexuality.""' The techniques contained in the book provide the most complete background for all hypnotherapy. A must read for therapists who wish to be very effective!"
5,I can do with out his other albums but not this one,"Wow I was dating an Italian who would play this and I was hooked. I can do with other his other albums but not this one. Every song is passionately soulful & like a fantacy of which I can play a movie in my head of what for instance he or someone might have went threw similar to what he is singing when I hear it over and over again, its great, one day it will be me. I don't understand most of the words only those that sound like spanish, but I get the point and remember what my Italian friend explained to me. This album can stir up some nice thoughts in you too. SO BUY IT"
3,A turning point in eros' music,"This album is great for true eros fans, but if it was the first or only album i had listened to, i would not be so crazy about him. There are too many repetitive bars of music and having Patsy Kensit, an american singer, join eros in La Luce Buona delle stelle was not very appealing; i always fast forward the song... I must say that most of the songs are well-written and have true meaning in relation to my life."
4,A good yarn if with sowhat unbelievable scenes,A good seafaring yarn that mostly rings true but there are a couple of scenes that just don't make the grade in that respect. A satisfying ending to the trilogy though that neatly wrappes up a number of plot lines that were left open in the previous two books.
3,Good but not great,"If you are a fan of Bernhardt's previous books, you might well enjoy this one too, but it isn't the best.The usual well paced plotting faulters a bit, but it does, in the end work. Without giving away the end, I think it fell a little flat, disappointing in some ways, as I said, if you are a fan, you'll get it."
5,Great legal thriller,"See book summary above.With Bernhardts latest, he proves to be one of the best legal thriller writers out there. The storyline and it's subplots-- one hinting on how weak minds can become so brainwashed into believing something--makes for a great and sometimes graphically violent novel.Keep'em coming William.Highly Recommended."
3,Liberal polemics replace mystery fiction,"What began as a great mystery series has now degenerated into a liberal polemic. Every book Bernhardt writes now is promoting his liberal world view: against the death penalty, pro-homosexula rights, anti-biblical Christian, etc. etc. While one can tolerate an author inserting political views subtly in the middle of an engaging story, this is little more than an essay for some liberal nonfiction publication. I hope Bernhardt gets back to writing mystery fiction.While Bernhardt began the Ben Kincaid series writing entertaining tales with an heroic young lawyer, the last few books have degenerated into liberal clap-trap: anti-death penalty, Christians who believe the Bible are idiots, that sort of thing. It has become rather tiresome."
1,"gay themes are well-meaning, but not believable","This novel is essentially a very long episode of 'Law & Order: SVU' that relies on plot twists that do not feel organic to the story or characters. The most annoying element to me is the various diary entries of the gay male murder victim, which seem gracelessly inserted to humanize the victim and encourage tolerance for gay people in general. These diary entries are unconvincing; they are in the voice of an afterschool special instead of a gay man in a large city.I assume the author is straight, and that an antigay hate crime is used in this book of the series much as it is in an episode of a television crime procedural series: a fresh framework for a standard murder mystery. Regardless of his own sexuality, he has not written a believable gay character or even a believable gay milieu. Any remaining pro-gay goodwill is undermined by the plot twists, because of course the crime is not what it seems."
3,This is a nice CD to reminisce with.,"I'm a bit on the young side, but I know Expose. In fact, I think nothing says 1980's pop ballads more than a song by this very talented group.My favorite track is ""In Walked Love"" which just reminds me of walking around in my booty-shorts with two stripes coming down the sides, and a Coca Cola bottle (glass, not plastic) in my hand, and spotting the girl of my dreams. Or at least the first girl of my dreams, before the next few dozen or so.Ah yes, I'll never forget the 80's."
4,The addition of Kelly Moneymaker should have had them making more money,"This is almost certainly the best album that this group has made, and you would think that with several hits and the talents of new member Kelly Moneymaker (her actual name), they would have made even more albums. Unfortunately, this was their last album except for a Greatest Hits collection. Kelly went on to a moderately successful singing/acting career, but at this point, Expose seems to be on a permanent hiatus."
1,BORING. NOTHING new that i did not already know.,"i have been a sports writer for many years. i have been to a thousand games. i have met a thousand athletes, but the stuff written in this book comes across as fiction--very bad fiction."
1,LABELS UNLIMITED,"COULD NOT INSTALL ON MY XP PRO SYSTEM- ENCOUNTERED A DLL ERROR AND HAD TO RESTART MY SYSTEM, ACTUALLY I HAD TO UNPLUG AND REBOOT"
1,Label Program,"Had to return this product to seller. I was able to download, but could not make the program work. Would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Labels Limited,"My old Labels Unlimited was a great program, and I used it frequently; but the 2.0 version would not run on my Windows 7 computer."
3,Exercise Exploitation,"I need everyone who sells the idea that six pack abs can be accomplished by the right diet and exercise to let users know that genetics has a part to play as well. While the right diet and exercise program will lead to fat loss and muscular development, there is really no guarantee that you will be able to attain the definition seen in John Basedow's abs. This video while inexpensive, is simply just a combination of ab exercises that you can get from any fitness website (for free) and put together yourself. He also spends some time talking about supplements which you can again research yourself or walk into any nutrition store to get the information you need."
5,Glitch-Electro for boomcar blastin,"Released on Warp for Europe, this mini-lp came out in America on Schematic. A scathing high speed DSP(digital signal processing) fest, this album seems absurd and mindless at first, but grows. The beats get tighter and the jittering explosion of granular stereo sound errors that frame them become more catchy as you listen. Then you start thinking about the structure. I played the second track for a friend of mine, playing the beginning and then fastforwarding to the ""payoff"" where the beat realty comes in half way. He immediately started counting.""hey,"" he said after a minute, ""that's a 28-part time signature!""If you've got a system, represent. This is some of the phatest glitch/IDM out, and its from right in our own backyard! You can get it at NON IMPORT PRICES at any good local store-Support the American scene, buy Schematic"
4,LISA STANSFIELD,"AFTER REVIEWING LISA STANSFIELD'S ""REAL LOVE"" CD, I FIND THAT HER BALLADS REALLY MAKE HER THE SONGTRESS THAT SHE IS."
3,Smooth,"What Lisa lacks in originality and depth, she more than makes up for it with good production,pleasant vocals, and addictive hooks. This album is a nice mix of pop and soul, with even some house grooves thrown in.There's nothing more to say. You could both get your groove on and relax to this album, and you could do both equally well. I also have to comment that the album sounds fresh and up to date. Lisa Stansfield is never going to be someone I go nuts about, but I'm willing to give this album 3 stars just because it's well put together and nice to listen to."
4,Very informative,"Being new in the business (secretary of a bondsman), I wanted examples and info on bail bonding. I found the book very informative. The writer got the point across and briefed me on the business, and that is what I needed. It actually was the only book available on this subject! (thanks Mr. Wills) I am glad I discovered this book and am very happy with the information I received."
2,Pediatric Neurology for the House Officer,Lots of unexpected writing and underlining in the book. Text smelled like smoke.
5,Perfect,"As an avid Kinks fan, I can say that this is one of the bands best pieces of work. Musically very different from ARTHUR, this album blends very well and every song is entertaining. From the deliciously scathing DENMARK STREET to the gentle A LONG WAY FROM HOME and of course LOLA her(or HIM?)self. This album is a vicious attack on the pretentious pop machine that in just five or six short years after this album would bring on (AAAGH!) disco. STRANGERS (definately one of Dave's more poignant compositions) helps distinguish the album's friends from its enemies. Like VILLAGE GREEN, LOLA is a must-have for any Kinks fan, and if you don't know a lot about the Kinks, this disc is a good introduction."
4,The Kinks Enters the 70`s,"Most of the album ""Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround"" deals the cynicism of the music-business; as always there is a good portion of humour in Ray Davies` lyrics.My favourites on this album though, are amongs the songs that do not directly refer to the music business.""Get Back in the Line"" is outstanding - I`ll never forget my delight when the band played the song in Viborg ( Denmark ) back in 1974. Other favourites are ""This Time Tomorrow"", ""A Long Way From Home"" and Dave`s ""Strangers"".And of course the two hits ""Lola"" and ""Apeman""Unfortunately there are only 3 bonus-tracks here. The single versions of ""Lola"" and ""Apeman"" ( rougher Danish single release) are logic additions, but it would have been nice if there had been some previously unreleased tracks, or some from ""The Great Lost Kinks Album""."
5,Best book on rattlesnakes ever written.,This is by far the best book on the subject of rattlesnakes ever written. I am so glad they made a second edition. Everything you ever wanted to know about rattlesnakes is in this book.
2,I'm Confused,"I bought this for my son, As A Christmas present request, My son works in a Texas Zoo and is an aspiring herpetologist, So I ordered the books and to my confusion I only recieved one book, and it said right in the title a 2 Volume set,- (Rattlesnakes: Their Habits, Life Histories, and Influence on Mankind, Second edition (2 volume set) (Hardcover)- So am I missing something or did I get ripped off ?"
1,More Pabulum for the Masses,"The only reason I'm buying this CD is because my grandmother asked for it. But this is one more example of the type schlock that PBS has been peddling as art during the past few years. This kid ranks right up there with Helmut Lotti, Andre Liue, Charlotte Chruch and others who are granted way too much air time on PBS in place of far more deserving and far more talented artists. I now believe that Newt Gingrich was right--I don't want my tax dollars supporting PBS so they can broadcast the television equivilent of Jell-o."
3,A Writer's Memoir with Little About Writing,"Fay Weldon is a favorite author of mine, and I liked learning about her life which consisted mainly of adventures in poverty from childhood in New Zealand on. The early years are well detailed. As an adult writer though she seemed to vaguely morph from being an impecunious beginner to a big success with specifics airbrushed over. Would be a re-read."
5,The best book on concentration I have ever read.,I have read other books on concentration and meditation but this one is different. It teaches you how to train your mind as a willing and happy student as opposed to whipping your mind into shape as a master over a slave. The methods work and my concentration has improved greatly as a result.
5,An Inexpensive Gem,"A practical introduction with exercises for developing practical concentration skills regardless of whether of not you have any interest in meditating (which I do not.). Most of Wood's books are good, but this is my favorite."
5,Excelent book to improve your concentration and memory,I did all the excercises in the book and it really works. It has helped me through college and now in my professional life.
2,Only so-so.,"Unfortunately this was for the original version of One-Note, not my Office 2007 version. MANY of the points still applied however, so it wasn't useless. Probably mostly my fault for not reading some fine print or something."
1,Be very very carful when using this,got a set of these and two of them broke on my when i was inserting them in the cork stopper. consider getting the S-shape air stopper instead. i wont buy these again.
5,Perfect Airlock!!!,This product is made in good quality plastic material. It does not feel cheap at all. It is pretty thick and durable as well. Good for homemade wine and beermaking with carboy or 64 oz. bottle of Welch's Juice.
4,nice,"just got it and seems to be a good product, only gave it a 4/5 because one of them was brooken but for 2$ for 3 still more than i need"
1,AAH!,well it is an air lock. but i bought it hoping for the rubber plug too. kinda useless without that.
4,Nice simple airlock,"This three-pack is good quality, a little thinner plastic than my other 3-piece locks, but perfectly usable. Another difference I noticed was that the bottom opening has no grid over the opening. At first I thought this was a cut-corner to keep price low, but after a couple of active fermentation that bubbled into the chamber I appreciate how much easier this design is to clean. It also will not plug with hops as easy, so should be safer than my others."
5,bubble away,"this is the second set i have purchased and work better than discribed,if i need to enlarge my wine making i will purchase more of this type of airlock again, they work great, i highly recommend this product"
4,Super Cute,"I don't wear dresses very often but I fell in love with it here on Amazon and I figured that even if I didnt like the way it looked on me it was only [...] so I could just give it as a gift, but I fell in love with it! It is super flattering and very comfortable. I thought it was going to be a little longer though, but I suppose that's my fault for not fully reading the demensions. I can't wait to make a little bolero to match. Love it!"
3,An overall okay dress,"While I was mostly satisfied with the dress, it was definitely not made for taller ladies. At 5'11"", the underslip was sketchily short on me and I had to rig another slip underneath the sheer part so I wouldn't be flashing people all over the place, and I'm not a curvy girl, so I can only imagine the constant hem pulling others might experience. As others have warned, the sizes can be deceiving. The dress is made to be tight already, so air on the side of too big."
2,Horrible Company!,"After I FINALLY recieved my dress it was BEAUTIFUL until I seen the ""run"" in it all the way from the hip to the hem line! I contacted the company, they said to send it back and I'd get my money back, I sent it back and they claim they never received it! So now Im stuck with no dress or money!"
2,Sizing isn't accurate or anywhere close to common sizing,"This dress is cute in the picture... but pretty thin and flimsy - so if it doesn't fit right it comes off looking very, well, I don't think I can say the word on this forum. I looked at the sizing chart before ordering, but it still was very snug and didn't lay right. If you have anything over an A or B cup - forget it! Also, the underlayer doesn't come down to the bottom of the sheer layer on top - it stops 6 or 8 inches short... making it look less classy than trashy. I returned it... a cute dress doesn't do any good if you can't wear it!"
2,how many harvard med school grads write books like this?,"Dr. McCarthy has added to the somewhat tiresome tradition of Harvard Medical School confessionals. I read this book at the end of my second year of medical school (no, not harvard, thank you!) and found her stories hum-drum at best, pedantic, preachy, and underhandedly self-congratulatory at worst. In addition, Dr. McCarthy's editor clearly rushed through this one - there are numerous instances of convoluted grammer that detract from the flow of the prose. So in summary: if you're a premedical/medical student or a doc, just keep your eyes and ears open and you'll collect lots more meaningful experiences than this book could ever give you; and if you're one of those lay people who likes to life the medical life vicariously, put down this book and spend some time volunteering at your local hospital."
2,Item received in time,"The material, specially the Clips are so low in Quality, it does not hold at all. Cost me $17 including the shipping. Does not worth $3. Some time Things are not good as it looks in the Picture. I do not know what part of this item is made in the US. I learned my lesson. Do not buy things those are not 100% guaranteed for full refund if sot satisfied."
2,"Necessary evil. Quality is poor, but other market offerings are worse.","Small switches aren't a nuisance, although they do break off in time. Hunter is quick to replace little plastic pieces for free. After researching Lowes, Home Depot and online, this is still the best design for my family's needs."
2,Fragile dimmer switch,"I also installed this dimmer/fan control switch. It was a nice thing to have and worked like it should until after about a year, the dimmer switch broke off in my hand."
1,Clunky and Junky,"As others have said, this switch is a real piece of junk. Not too long after I installed it, the little knob on the fan speed slider broke. Now practically every time we try to use it, it falls off onto the floor and we have to go chase after it and then hope we can get it back on then hope it will stay on.Even worse that that, though is the super cheap clunky switch on the inside. I don't even think it's possible to slide the switch and land on the right notch the first time. Invariably you will overshoot or undershoot the notch and have to jiggle it into place (that is if the knob you're trying to hold onto doesn't fall off onto the floor.)Avoid this piece of junk. Buy something else."
1,Just replaced my second Hunter switch,"I just replaced the second switch in 3 years. This time I replaced it with a Lutron switch, which seems to be constructed better and has gotten better reviews."
2,Knobs broke off,"I bought 2 of these dimmer switches and on both of them, the knobs broke off within 3 months. Not having a receipt, I called Hunter where it cost $20 to have these replaced. They are mailing the replacement knobs to me, but I am afraid the same thing will happen again. Dimmer works fine, but knobs are extremely shabby. Eventually I will wind up replacing both of these switches due to this problem."
3,"Hey, mine lasted 5 years...","My switch lasted 5 years until the infamous failing of the plastic cover of the switch- the lights in my case. (Not unexpected since we almost never touch the fan, it's on low 24/7). I came to Amazon for a replacement but found all these horrible reviews- it didn't seem worth even calling them for a free replacement that will just break again and again. I found another switch that should work, I will review it after it's installed.Lutron S2-LFSQH-WH Electronics Dual Slide-To-Off Fan and Light Control, White"
1,Inferior design and quality,I bought three of these switches and the sliding knobs have broken off on all three switches - some within a couple of weeks of installation. They are way too fragile for a swtich that is used frequently - especially with kids. Spend the extra money for a higher quality switch. I would not recommend these switches to my worst enemy.....they're horrible!!
1,Poor quality for Hunter,"Expected the slide buttons to actually stay on the switch. VERY POOR quality from Hunter - love their fans but these switches are cheap, replaced them all with slide switches from Home Depot."
1,fragile knobs - they will break trust me,"We had four knobs installed in our new home. The electrician broken one during the installation. We broken the remaining knobs within a short time period. The sad part is that after the first one broken, we realized how fragile the knobs were and were extra careful, but they still snapped off. So now we are left with jagged pointy plastic stems to control the light and fan. The vendor should be ashamed to continue to sell this inferior product. If they did any kind of quality assurance testing, it would have been caught."
2,Feels cheaply made and easily breaks,"It generally does what it's supposed to do. However, the controls feel cheaply made. I purchased three of these. In the first year, all three have broken. Specifically, the white plastic piece that turns the light on and off has broken on all three."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,I have these in each of my bedrooms and EVERY SINGLE knob is broken off...and I cannot find replacements! SO CHEAP!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!
1,Mechanically bad!,"I had this type of switch in a house for 10 years, and the original knobs lasted about that time. Decided to replace with the same brand/type, for which the knobs lasted 2 months. Apparently new maker/vendor, bad/wrong type of plastic is being used by the maker for the sliding knobs. Returned mine to Lowe's for a refund."
2,Broke after 2 years,We had a one of these installed in our master bath. The tab broke off the light dimmer after 2 years of relatively light use.Steve
2,Tabs pop off and sliders break,The knobs fall off of the sliders and the sliders are plastic and break. Not rugged enough for a room where kids will be working the knobs.
3,y not buy direct?,It's OK. Henry's website has this and many other albums and media on sale for $5 each. Why not go there and buy direct and get the $ to the artist first?
3,An okay album,"This is Soulwax first album. It's a nice album, but what you really want is their next newer album: MuchAgainstEveryonesAdvice. That is a ***** five star album. This one is okay, but it's not definate enough."
3,Only fits Porter's soap,"A nice, well-designed mug. It has an ""old-fashioned"" look, and the curved lip helps you avoid knocking the brush against the mug when lathering. Unfortunately, the mug so narrow it only fits Porter's brand soap, which is the worst shaving soap I have used. This makes the mug useless with any decent soap, and my mug now sits alone in the cupboard."
2,This is a MUG not a bowl,"Just got this mug, and it looks great and feels great, except when I go to use it. I've got a relatively large handled brush, so I could squeeze it and 3 fingers in there, but once in, forget moving around. So lather was a no-go with this product. I don't know by how much my brush handle is bigger, but I can't see this being used practically by anyone. Try out a larger coffee mug and you'll get the idea on how much room this thing has. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, not many soaps fit in this thing. Do yourself a favor and look for an actual shaving bowl, your wrist and fingers will thank you for it."
5,Very attractive mug,My husband uses this mug everyday and it is a very sturdy and attractive mug. Works well for its purpose.
3,"Better players than me recommend it, but...","I'm rated 1800 and have probably spent more time than most players at that rating on endgames. The general level of this book was too high for me.A lot of this book is verbatim reprinting of analysis by Capablanca, Alekhine, Bondarevsky, and others. Shereshevsky has done a good job of collecting positions by themes, but he seems to have acted more as an editor than author."
5,Blast from my past,"I grew up eating this as a child. When we were kids, my mom would fix this all by itself and my sister and I had dinner. What's so good about it is, that unlike other things we used eat way back then, the ""Chicken Egg Noodle Dinner"" (which is what I remember it being named) tastes as good to me now as it did all those years ago. Few things out there can do that - as we grow up our tastes do change, but this one's the exception to that rule.This is a dish that goes great with everything - chicken, beef, pork (especially porkchops) or is awesome by itself. And, if you think it's boring alone, it can be worked into tons of recipies to give it a new twist on a classic (such as casseroles)."
5,Excited to find it again!!,"I have not had this for about 9 years. I have looked in a bunch of different stores for this, and haven't found it. I am excited to order some when more become available. I hope my kids like it as much as I do. I will also be telling family and friends that they can find it here. Can't wait to order!!"
3,MNReview,Good taste. Little salty. (A basic for Comfort food.) Also works great to mix some veggies into.
2,Think Twice,"I ate Kraft chicken noodle dinner on a regular basis in college and beyond, especially adding some real chicken (diced leftovers) and finely chopped veggies. Then I found out about MSG and how really, very bad it is for you. I stopped eating this and all prepared foods with MSG and autolyzed proteins. Kraft chicken noodle dinner tastes great, but this is one habit that you shouldn't form if you haven't already started."
4,Found a long lost friend,"I grew up eating this stuff, and it is very hard to find in grocery stores in certain regions of the US. So, thanks to Amazon my family is now able to enjoy these tasty noodles once again. We eat these noodles as a main dish, but they make an excellent side dish for chicken as well."
5,A taste of my childhood,"Noodles and chicken was a moderate staple of my childhood (along with Kraft Mac N Cheese and Spaghettios).I had a craving for these a few months back and NO ONE but NO ONE carries them. My mom found them here.They are much better with butter (as per the original recipe), instead of the healthy veggie oil version. The noodles stay a little firmer than your average mac n cheese noodle (not necessarily a bad thing, just FYI), but the flavour and everything is wonderful. Thank you Amazon!"
5,"simple, inexpensive comfort food","I have been looking for this product for ages now as it's not available in any stores in my area. This is something I ate frequently in college and my son enjoyed as a child. He has been looking on line for it so we could enjoy it once more. It's a taste of warm, inexpensive comfort food especially if one adds a can of Swanson's chicken breast to it. YUM:) Now my grandson is enjoying it as a toddler and the entire family loves it for a snack or for a quick lunch. It's a taste of childhood, warmth, home."
5,Great side dish,"Exactly what side dish I had been looking. Had eaten back in the early 90's and forgot all about it till I seen it on TV. So glad I found it, my whole family loves this."
4,Old time favorite,"I bought this for my boyfriend because he said when he was younger he ate this all the time and it was one of his favorites. I'm a vegetarian and I never had this product but he said it was out of this world and even better than he remembers (when I made it for him). First time he made it for himself he did not use boiling water. You need to use boiling water for this recipe to come out right because I used boiling water and he said it's great! He was also able to give some boxes to his sons, so that's nice about having so many shipped to you at once, you can share!"
1,"Had BUGS in it, poor packaging","These noodles were very good, but my boxes had bugs in them - small, black, about half a size of a small ant. Packaging is bad - noodles are not sealed, they're just plain in the box, coated in seasoning and all. Any bug can get into this box and feast on tasty noodles. I can't imagine why they made the choice not to put them at least in a sealed plastic bag inside the package. Plain noodles are ok, they're completely dry, but this product was seasoned. For this reason I'd never buy them again. Bugs took good 2 months to get rid of, extremely annoying in a completely bug-free home. Now I understand why all seasoned noodles come in plastic packaging. I had to throw out all remaining noodles."
4,"The only way to get ""Watertown""!","This is certainly a great purchase for either the die-hard Sinatra fan or the complete novice. But for me, the real bonus is that it's the only way to get a hold of ""Watertown,"" Sinatra's 1970 concept album about a small town father pining for the woman he lost. While the arrangements are straight from the So-Cal Mellow Rock School of the 70s (strings, acoustic guitars, bad drumming), Sinatra's in great voice, and the overall theme of love and loss eventually wins you over in some way. Certainly a unique chapter in Sinatra's varied career. Hopefully, they'll reissue it one day, but until then, here's your only shot at hearing it."
3,WHY CHANGE THE ORDER OF SONGS?,"like the Charles Mingus Complete Atlantic Recordings, WHY CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE SONGS. these were albums that fit together. what idiot run these companies? do they just put the stuff on random play for the order? i would love to have these because some of these recordings are hard to find. His label, but some of his stuff is hard to find. doesn't make sense, does it?"
5,The best book on soccer ever written,"This is not only a must read for all soccer lovers, but all literature lovers. If you don't know spanish check out the English translation."
4,Fun movie,"Nice movie. Reminds me of Lost in Translation, but more down-to-earth. Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega had good chemistry. I'm a big fan of traveling movies, as in movies that show the characters in different places. This one traversed rural LA and i loved it."
4,"Sweet, just sweet","I love Paz Vega, I have almost all her movies. This one is an example of the hollywood comedies, good production, take care of every detail... I like it, with a wide open mind.She is gorgeous as always, in this case I felt like curious, there is Morgan Freeman, he's not Adam Sandler (sorry Sandler's fans). So, I felt satisfied watching Paz Vega in a very good acting level.Of course, I can remember many more movies where Paz Vega is excellent in many ways, and Morgan Freeman too."
4,Good movie with Awesome soundtrack,"Can anyone tell me the name of the song being played during the carwash scene? it has one of the best beats Ive heard in a long time. Any bit of information about the song would be helpful...artist, name of song, etc? This movie was pretty good and they definitely need to release the soundtrack."
2,"Aimless, a few cute scenes, high snooze factor","A rambling movie without a point (except for gather thee roses, dully stated) and long scenes of watching people check out, make pay phone calls, ride down rodes. A few mildly cute scenes save it from the dust bin of 1 star reviews, and of course Morgan's presence always adds a bit of gaiety. I've yet to see Paz Vega act. As usual she just stands around as a Hispanic stereotype. Dreadful movie with zero chemistry besides Morgan's coy smile."
1,Disappointing film that could have been better,"Just saw this on TV, and have happily now erased it. With a good script, this could have been an interesting film. It's a ""very thin cup of tea"" of a movie. All too thin. A good scriptwriter could have done something with the idea and given the characters something interesting to do and say. My advice: rent it before you buy it."
1,I stopped watching after the first two minutes...,"When the movie starts with someone dropping the F bomb in every sentence when it's not even in a valid context, it tells me that we have an ignorant A) character, B) actor, and C) DIRECTOR. They're nothing but sell-outs and propagating vulgarity in an unnecessary context. I'll make a point not to watch this directors movies.Even sadder is Morgan Freeman...you'd think he'd have more class or principles to put his foot down and not be a part of certain projects. Guess it's all about making a buck."
1,THUMBS DOWN TO FIRST LOOK PICTURES,"Another waste of time film from First Look Pictures who make awlful films, althoughI was able to stomach this one to the end (as opposed to The Amateurs).Shot on seemingly poor quality videotape the actors sleep-walk through the ""script"". An interesting idea for a film if the producers would've paid for a good scriptwriter, but they didn't. Yawn. Let me know when Paz Vega learns how to speak English - she looks great but she has such a thick Spanish accent that I cannot understand her when she speaks English - maybe subtitles would help.Again - avoid all films produced by First Look Pictures. You can tell these films by the cheap graphics at the very beginning. Maybe these are films made by film school students where the name actors donate their time for tax deductions."
3,Getting back your life,"He's (Morgan Freeman) not making a commitment, he's just doing research. He's a known actor, who's made a film with Ashley Judd, but hasn't been in a film in four years. The indie film company drops him off in a market where he meets Scarlet.Scarlet (Vega) is the 10 items or less aisle checker. She's running the market while the manager and his new girlfriend (Scarlet is his ex) are messing around.When Freeman's ride home doesn't show up, Scarlet takes him home on her way to a job interview. In helping to fix her up, Freeman regains his own confidence.""10 Items"" is an interesting character driven film, which Freeman and Vega can mostly carry. I found myself noting a bit too much product placement in this vehicle, but it's still an endearing tale of two very unalike people who are able to help each other."
1,didn't help,"i'm not sure if it made my dog's ear infection worse, but it surely didn't get better. for the price it was worth a try, but learn from my mistake"
1,Not for use on cats!!,The product description made no mention that it cannot be used on cats. It wasn't until I received the item that I read on the label that it's not for use on cats. I complained to the seller (Probiotic Smart) and then had to jump through hoops to get a refund.
5,Better and safer than the prescription product,"I didn't like the idea of continuing to give our cat expensive prescription ear drops that contained a steroid, so ordered this.It worked great! Quicker and better than the steroid ear drops the vet prescribes for her chronic ear problem. Cleared everything up in a couple days and no further problems for a couple weeks now. Highly recommend."
4,Wonderful produce,"I have a cocker spanniel and I love these product. We use is every other day and he doesnt seem to mind. The ""stuff"" that I got from the vet used to cost me $$ and I would have to chase him down. I imagine it burned? He will now come over and lay down in front of me and let me baby him."
4,BUT!,"4 stars but ""i can't make music"" gets 5. It is a real heartbreaker of a song both lyrically and melody-wise. If you are a fan of Karen Carpenter and have alot of greatest hits and haven't heard this song i recommend you buy this cd. The rest of the cd except for ""masquerade"" and ""yesterday once more"" isn't classic ""carpenters"" to me but ""music"" is. Then again if you are an ""oldies"" fan you will probably love the rest of the cd too."
1,Remastered?? Try Remixed...,"It only took listening to one song to regret buying this CD as it has been REMIXED. I expected to buy just a remastered version of the ORIGINAL album/CD...wrong...take the song ""Yesterday Once More""...not only has the speed been hiked up slightly, but it is a blatantly different mix...one example, at the time 1:25 on the track, a piano riff has replaced what used to be there.I understand Richard Carpenter has a reputation for continually remixing songs, but do the fans a favor and at least advertise on the CD that these are remixes, not simply remasters. I want to hear the song I know and remember, but remastered for superior quality, THAT'S IT. I'm glad I kept my orginal CD."
5,When I Was Young I Listened To The Radio,"When this record was first released, I could not stand Sing. However, the second side of the album is witty and breathtaking, particularly Da Doo Ron Ron and One Fine Day. Remastering has improved the quality of the sound tremendously. A classic album along with A Song For You."
5,Good,The cd arrived on time and in great condition. I would use them again. I am very satisfied with everything.
3,Ok but not great,"I have something to say to Cam only if he cares. Don't put pre-released tracks on yo album u won't sell as much. honestly would u buy something u heard 5 months ago? Where are the heatmaker and kanye west for that matter Just Blaze""he made Cam platinum with oh boy"" GO FIND JUST BLAZE AND PUT HIM ON THE ALBUM u talk about having money get some big name producers . i understand u want to help the hood and enlist some underground producers but don't mix the hood with actually making money.And u wanna compete with Jay-Z well show us man!!!"
3,dip set 4 ever nigga,mane i dip set fan on the real.......this is a nice album on the lrycis level it a 3 out of 5 and the beat is a 2 1/2 and the guests on the album is a 4 so overall its a 3 fo the hold thang.
4,Very Hot Movie! Dipset The Movement Moves On! Killa Season Is Here!,"Killa Season is fire. I respect Cam and Dipset because they haven't compromised the quality of there music. It's still hard as day one!The movie Killa Season is indeed very violent, but entertaining. Dipset set raps about guns and drugs, so you should expect to see this in there movie. The movie is not popcorn or watered down in the least.For a low budjet release it is solid, and they keep doin it with the clothes, mixtapes and now movies!I have to respect Dip Set because they always keep it thorough! Cop this movie, you'll love it"
3,Killa Season Just OK,"I am a big fan of the whole Dipset movement Cam'ron,Hell Rell,Juelz Santana,Jim Jones,JR Writer and have been for quite a while. But I must say that I wasn't all that impressed with the movie Killa Season. Cam didn't do a bad job directing and I enjoyed everyone's performance. I think the film lacked a good script, but compared to alot of other flicks like this out there this was the better one. Definitley worth checking out though if your a fan. Two major disapointment though was Michael K Williams wasn't in it long enough and the abrupt horrible ending. Like I said though if your a fan or you like these type of flicks check it out, if your not stay away."
1,I got a boot leg,"I ordered this from 2 different people and this is was the last one i ordered. I know that it was a bootleg. It had a photocopy cover and i noticed that the disk was one that was printed out like at someones home. I gave it away. Very dissappointing, I know a bootleg, cause that is all that they sell here in iraq."
2,it was ok...but fake,"cameron is wack, because this movie is just like every other rapper who makes these low budget movies such as thicker than water, bout it, state property, all these guys selling so much drugs, and becoming boss tycoons! they dreamin trying to live the life they know nothing about. cameron is a busta he never lived nothing like that. stop trying to be scarface, and stop wasting film, and money on wack movies that we already seen this story. make something good, and entertaining you wack rapper"
3,IT IS WHAT IT IS......,"When watching this movie, I knew that it was not gonna be a ""Block Buster""....BUT, If hood movies are your thing, then you should have known what it was heading for. This is something to simply just watch and moke too....IT'S Entertainment!I laffed at the Actors and how much they could not act the part, I fount that funny...But whatever.I didn't expect it to have quality actors like a high budget film would have. Or have the preciseness of a Director such have Quentin Tarentino.... But, I'm not gone front I do have plans on watching this movie again....IT IS WHAT IT IS.I focks wit it."
1,Let us pray,"What the HE77 was that??? Yo I tried Cam, your music is straight and all but hang up the camera and pick up the mic. Stick to your day job (rapping)."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!","This movie is so good, I can watch it over and over again, I had no idea that CamRon was such a great actor."
4,Good street movie,This is one of Camron's first acting gigs .Over all I feel the movie did a goodJob showing life of a NYC drug dealer.Itwas very comical aswell.
3,Killa Season 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I liked it for what it was it was decent. Not better than Paid In Full, but it is definitely worth having in your collection, if you like these types of movies and especially if you like Camron. I think he plays his parts very well. It was entertaining and should not be overlooked.Oh yeah, but I really need to see what happens after the fact, the second one should have BEEN OUT!"
5,Simple elegance,I drive a sports car so I like the simple elegance this sleek matt finish key chain represents. Push-in and turn the key ring to open to add your keys and twist back into lock position.
4,Sweetly delightful listening,Sarah is by far my favorite artist. Surfacing was the first cd of hers I purchased and I was hooked from the first time I heard Angel. Solace is a great collection of songs that is fun for most activities ::giggles:: Hope you enjoy the music!
2,I am disappointed in this album,"I became a Sarah McLachlan fan after borrowing a copy of ""Fumbling.."". from a friend. That's the album that immediately caught my interest in Sarah's music. Then, I also got Surfacing which I think, while a good cd, doesn't live up to the level of ""Fumbling."" I definitely consider myself a fan of hers, but I recently bought ""Solace"" after reading the reviews here on Amazon, and am disappointed in the album. It is not nearly as catchy and as immediately likeable as some of her other albums. Having listened to it several times, I still find myself trying to get drawn into the music more. Perhaps with more listening, it'll ""grow"" on me. However, I enjoy a more accessable type of music."
1,garbage,"Nothing but garbage, pure and simple! She sounds worse than a road-kill cat gasping for air! Just plain awful!"
2,Pretty voice but nothing here whatsoever.,"It's a good album to listen to while cleaning your apartment. Save your money. Assuming your time is valuable don't bother listening to it. It would be a complete and total waste of time. Sarah proves again that she has some powerful pipes but so what? At least ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy"" has ""Possession"" and a couple of other songs which have hooks. You get the picture that Sarah was under pressure from the record company and just cranked out some songs with no hit potential and nothing really for the concentrating listener."
4,Hints of what is to follow,"For me ""Solace"" is Sarah's least successful album but it's still good. This is her second album and it shows greater maturity and hints more strongly of what is to follow than ""Touch"".Standout tracks for me are ""Drawn To The Rhythm"", ""Into The Fire"" and the haunting ""I Will Not Forget You"" a touching song that speaks to the part of each of us that has lost someone they love but still retains an upbeat, hopeful edge. My least favourite track is ""Black"" which for me doesn't fit in with the rest of the album. ""Wear Your Love Like Heaven"" is hard to define, with a very individual nature that still manages to endear and is a fitting closing track."
4,mesmerizing,"Although I'm a teenager, Sarah Mclachlan's voice is breath-taking.And her talent is impressive. Her lyrics express her talent as a poet. Her voice reaches the high and low notes with ease. Sarah showed her extreme talent with ""Mercy"". Doing both the lead, and background vocals. This cd is the foundation of her later works. She's a Goddess when it comes to music."
4,"McLachlan's 1991 ""Solace"" is a treat","After hearing ""Drawn to the Rhythm"" on the radio, I ordered ""Solace CDand was very pleased with it. Good lyrics as usual and ""Drawn..."" isthe first cut and very haunting with an Irish lilt to it. I am glad thatI purchased it as it is a pleasing listening experience. A few are alittle sad, but there is a good mix nonetheless. If you like SaraMcLachlan, then you will enjoy this CD."
4,Drawn to Solace,"My first purchase at Amazon!When I heard samples of I Will Not Forget You, Shelter, and Lost, I just felt I needed to own this CD. I'm glad I ordered this!People who enjoyed McLachlan's Surfacing, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and Afterglow will certainly like this album. Casual listeners may find only Drawn to the Rhythm, Path of Thorns, and I Will Not Forget You interesting for their catchy tune."
4,The album that made me an SM fan.,"This album takes a more acoustic guitar bent than her prior album, and releases the rocker of a song ""Into the Fire"". Live performances often yield an ""edgier"" version of that song. Sarah McLachlan's vocals adopt a very distinctive sound with this album, and it represents more maturity than her first effort."
3,"Not her best, but not bad either!","The style of music is VERY dated in this CD, but her lyrics are very nice. I disagree with others who say her voice sounds worse than gargling water, but I think this album is not her best. Fumbling was BY FAR her best."
4,Excellent sound and quality,All the songs on this album are good. You can definitely tell the difference in the early younger Sarah from her later albums but the good thing is she was extremely talented even on her earlier works. It also good for fan to see how she developed and honed her skills.I personally love Sarah's music and enjoy her earlier works..but I would say I prefer her later sound. But this is a definite must have for any REAL Sarah fan.
5,Emotionally Brilliant,"Sarah's second cd is my second favorite after Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. My favorite song on this album is ""The Path of Thorns"" it is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard! I also get a kick out of ""Backdoor Man"" and the catchy ""Wear Your Love like Heaven"". This album is a must for any die-hard sarah fan!"
5,Solace is ethereal!,"I first discovered Sarah McLachlan about a year ago with ""Surfacing,"" which totally mesmerized me, and led me to purchase her others. ""Solace,"" however, continues to speak the strongest to my heart. I adore every song on this album, but especially ""Mercy."" I noticed the review above called ""Mercy"" her ""least interesting."" I totally disagree. The eerie overlapping of her voice on this track sounds like a host of angels. Also, the dissonance is original and poignant. As a voice and piano major, Sarah is a daily inspiration to me to keep pressing on. Thanks for everything, Sarah, and I'll see you at Lilith '99!"
4,A Fine Album!,"What originally turned my attension towards Sarah McLachlan was her terrific song ""Building a Mystery"" which opens the the ""Lilith Fair"" 1997 DVD concert. I bought the DVD because of the contributions from Sheryl Crow and Indigo Girls. I then discovered that Sarah was a singer and an artist that could not be ignored. Her performances there are simply outstanding. Her great songs, her unforgettable voice and charm; convinced me.""Solace"" was her second album; first released in 1991. There are some very fine songs here; especially in the first half on the CD; the CD loses a little steam towards the end.My favourite track is ""The Path of Thorns"", but other songs like ""Drawn to the Rhytm"", ""Into the Fire"" and ""Lost"" are just as strong as most of her later recordings."
5,Enthusiastically recommended for serious jazz fans,"Saxophonist and composer Dave Tofani's An American Garden showcases original jazz compositions and performances. Flawlessly recorded and enthusiastically recommended for serious jazz fans and collectors, An American Garden comprises: New York At Night (3:23); Quintetto di Flauti (4:29); High Mowing Orchestral Suite (9:14); Elizabeth's Journey (4:04); Rough Ride (5:40); Liberte (6:17); and the title piece, An American Garden (5:39)."
1,"sick lyricks, bad music, worse vocal!",Songs about cutting women up get real! I could hardly make it through this one! Winner of one of the worst CD's in my collection!
5,A perfect food,I've taken this for years...the health benefits are amazing! I chug it all day long in my regular water. It gives you a ton of energy.
3,Haven't used it,"I haven't used it yet but the bottle top was smashed to smithereens when it arrived and green had leaked all over the inside of the package. I was roled in bubble wrap with very little additional protection. Product might be great, but shipping was awful."
5,Comes in handy in a variety of situations,"I am a soundman and I have used this snake at every gig I have had for two months straight. I have used it at every band rehearsal, DJ and Karaoke gig too. Instead of pulling out the long snakes with the stage boxes and fantails to deal with, I usually use this if I have to be positioned anywhere near the stage. Quite often, because of space constraints inside the venue, a full on snake is not an option and this has filled in nicely. Even when I do use the long snake, this is good to get all 7 of my drum mics away from theirs stands/clips, down to the floor and over to the stage box of the big snake. I could not do my job without this. I have not heard a crackle, pop or hiss from this thing since I have been using it and I use it almost every day. I never plug anything into a mixer since I got this not even when I practice drums at home by myself."
4,Pleased,"I bought this snake to connect a MOTU 896HD to a monitor mixer. The connectors are wired correctly, feel sturdy, well crafted, no shorts or interferrence - just clean audio. What more can you say about a XLR snake?"
5,"So far, so good.",Bought the snake for simplifying cabling between the stage and FoH. So far the product has been working well and seems well built.
5,EXCELLENT ! Works exactly as I planned for it,"Excellent!Product came quickly, and was packaged well.product is exactly as seller presented. New, 8 connectors rolled into one Snake.all connectors are secure, complete, and works perfectly.price: to be honest I spent less than what I originally intended when I went looking for product.granted its not the top of the line equipment, however,it is Dependable, Affordable, and actually a nice color!I am a happy camper, if this seller has these great prices on other equipment, I will be checking out his site before buying anywhere.ThanksRick"
4,Good value,It's a good value on an inexpensive snake cable. It's very nicely made and came in a nice storage bag and with a velcro cable wrap. Nice touch. It's XLR connectors are plastic but seem durable enough. Good value for the money for sure!
4,Does what it needs to do,"This is a simple 8 channel xlr snake. No Neutrik connectors, no input box, but works fine for what I need it for(transporting channels from my sound room to my control room).Because it's XLR, its a balanced signal, and its only 20 ft. so you really don't have to worry about losing any signal from your sound source.If you need to purchase an affordable xlr snake, this is your answer. Wouldn't quite trust it on the road. I don't think it would hold up. But if its for the studio, and you want to save some cash, this snake works great!"
3,Chrome Triple Hamper Sorter,"The service was absolutely wonderful, but the product leaves a little something to be desired. The clasp on the side bends very easily and makes it hard to open and close."
4,"Well, you know....","OK, Piccolo returned, Vegita saved Gohan and Kururin's lives, most may not notice but I did. Why? Because he's my favorate character. I wish Gokuh would hurry up and be Super Saiya though. He will real soon because it's on the side of the cover. Four stars because the story's there, but I much prefer the origanal Japanese version."
4,"The action of it was slow in the beginning, but it sped up.",Vegeta is my favorite character of the whole saga. I'm glad he got a good piece of Frieza for destroying his father and his home planet.
3,Episode 50-69,I din't raelly like the episode bacause it keeps waisting time. They should put more action in it.
4,Too Cute!,"This was an adorable costume. It's on the big side - closer to a six month outfit. The head piece was big for my son so I stuffed it with some paper towels and it worked just fine. The color was a little more orange then red. We received lots of compliments and I was proud to be ""elmo's mom""!"
5,Take your mind on a deep & creative ride.,"I have owned this CD for several years and find myself loving it more with each passing season. This is hypnotic and thought provoking. The lack of lyrics is fabulous because it allows the listener to think, trip, or whatever, about whatever it is they are focusing on at the moment. Likewise, it can take you a million miles away from the troubles of the day without a horrifying hangover. BUY THIS CD! It is one of the best I have ever purchased and I own hundreds."
4,After 7 songs...,It gets good... Not much of an ambient music lover but I did enjoy the music after #7... The last song.. like previous fan said before me is a gem... but it can get cheesy but to sit down and listen to something that is non racist and non conforming for just 3 minutes is good in my opinon... state of indepedence is beautifull good job moodswings...
4,Martin Luther King would be proud,"Every February, I inevitably hear the cut from this CD that includes Martin Luther King's ""I have a dream"" speech. it is a tasteful and inspirational treatment.Fact is, 90% of this CD is variations on a theme, including the Martin Luther Kind portion. This is a good CD to put on and let track.Kind of dancy, kind of electronic. Overall, one of my favorites."
2,Greatly overrated,"The only part that interests me is the fine singing by Chrissie Hynde. The association of Reverend King with this project is as crass a piece of commercialization as any commemorative ashtray ever sold in a Washington DC or Atlanta souvenir store. The instrumental vamping between songs is painfully long and boring. And the songs themselves, for the most part, are as boring as the segues. A friend of mine bought this for me years ago, and I'm relistening for the first time in years -- it's as mediocre now as it was then, except that parts of it once seemed forgivably danceable. No more. As hard as it is to find new and different wastes of hydrocarbons, this nearly manages -- except, luv ya Chrissie."
5,Unexpected excellence from an unknown artist,"Never had heard of Moodswings despite the 'Moodfood' 1992 release date. Still, I bought this CD on a whim and I'm glad I did. Ranging from driving rhythm (try the 'Moodswings Overture' clip) to ethereal ambiance (listen to 'Throw Off The Shackles'), I'm 100% entertained and consider it a '100% Total Success'. (By the way, among the many errors made in critic Andrew Martin's review is that 'State of Indepence' was originally performed by Jon (Anderson) and Vangelis on their 'Friends of Mr. Cairo' album; Donna Summer covered it some time later.)"
1,Dated,"This album really does sound quite dated. If I had heard it 20 years ago, when I was into Vangelis and Jon Anderson, I might perhaps have enjoyed it then. But now it just sounds repetitive and bland. I played it a couple of times trying to convince myself that I liked it, but just couldn't. If you are seeking some ambient music, try looking for something more recent."
4,Astonishingly good symphonies from a little known composer,"I am not a big fan of unknown composers generally since their works usually have significant weaknesses that mar what interesting passages exist. These two symphonies however are excellent, moving and entertaining. To me, Magnard is to the 19th century French symphony what Elgar is to the English symphony - the finest flowering of a basically non-existent stock. The performances are fine and Hyperion is my favorite label for CD sound quality. I gave it four stars only because this is not Mahler or Beethoven but it is very fine and worth getting if you have any interest in fine symphonic writing or French romantic music."
3,"Nice idea, not exactly ethical","I really like the ""Path of the Heart"" idea in the introduction so I bought the book. I've just finished the chapter on study strategy.I accept pre-med school is very competitive. But strategies suggest might get you an A in the class, but you won't know an atomfrom inch worm at the end of four years. No the kind of doctor I want to become."
3,Good Read,"I am a senior in high school planning to do pre med at a four year university. This is would be considered an excellent read if you have no idea about the basic requirements and challenges of medical school. On the other hand, if you already have a solid background on what it takes to become a physician then the material is very repititive.Personally, I had a thorough knowledge of medicine before I read this book. But the timeline that is provided in the book that suggests a courseload seemed to be very useful. I am definitely going to use this book as a reference when I am ready to apply to medical school."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed and agree with others by saying this is not one of Mrs. Forsters best. I have not finished the book and have never taken this long with any of her books. I think Regina is too prim and proper and her relationship with Justin has taken too long to surface. I had to re-read a few sentences to know they'd been intimate and they are the main characters. I recommend others but not this one. I also want to know how does he look? Did I miss that?
2,Very Disappointing,"I'm on page 278 and I can't wait to get to the end of this long, drawn out book. I've read several of Ms. Forster's books but none has been as disappointing as this one. I don't care if the central characters, Regina and Justin, get together or not. If it hadn't been for Pop and Maude I would have put this book down a long time ago."
2,Don't buy it,This book was very boring. I was disappointed in Ms. Forster. I have read several of her books and this was one I did not enjoy. There was too much push and pull between the two supposed main characters. By the end of the book you didn't even really care if they got together or not. They got together on almost the last page of the book. The book focused more on Maude and her relationship with Johann. I am glad I got it from the library and will not be sorry to return it.
2,CUTE BUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"This book dragged and dragged, and it's pretty predictable! It's a cute book and had it not been for the grandfather and Aunt Maude I probably would have put it down....As a matter of fact this book was disappointing! It left you hanging I'm still really not sure if Justin and Regina had sex, if Harold is gay, or what role Cephus played!??? Read it only if there is nothing else in your house!!!!!!!"
2,Blues From Down Deep,"A&T College has never been UNCG. A&T College is now North Carolina A&T State University. If you're going to include the name of my alma mater in your material, do your homework. Other than that huge blunder, the story had potential but just seemed to drag on. I really had to push myself to finish this. The relationships of Regina/Justin and Maude/Johann piqued my interest, but the writing style didn't do their stories any justice."
3,only one song is good,the song i wont be home tonight is the only good song on this. but i like the song i wont be home tonight so im happy with this deal. tony carey is aii so in the group plant p with the good song why me. thank you
3,Returned due to no HDMI inputs,"Overall I was impressed with the service. However, I returned the receiver due to no HDMI inputs."
3,"Realistic close-up fantasy, but not a new ground-breaker.","Joel Rosenberg manages to continue his old storyline without any special new inventions. The old heroes is dusted off (I guess that Joel wanted to retire them entirely a couple of times during the books 1-3) and used again. Some 2nd role actors are killed off, together with the main characters in the end of the book. I could just feel Joels urge to finish the tale thoughout the book, and managing barely. Only to change his mind because of sentimentality for the well-known characters, and making a strange sortie and opening for next book..."
5,great product,I purchased these cushions for a set of wicker chairs. The fabric is beautiful and looks like it will hold up to changing weather conditions. They are comfortable and affordable. Highly recommend!
1,THE LAMEST/CORNIEST MUSIC I'VE EVER HEARD!,"GOD...""WAY DOWN YOUNDER ON THE CHATTACHOOCHIE""??? THAT'S THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD OF. THIS IS THE WORST COUNTRY MUSIC AROUND! IF YOU LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC LISTEN TO THE ALLMAN BROTHERS! YOU SUCK ALAN JACKSON!"
1,UGH!,"One more awful country cliche and I would have lost it! Even the song titles are about as predictable and stomach-turning as country can be! I'd give the album another listen just to find it's good points, but why put myself through that?"
1,This does NOT work on the iPhone,"Buyers beware this will NOT work on the iPhone, I even called them to double check and they said ""If it is in the description it will work."" This is the 3rd one of these I have bought that didn't work. I wish these retailers would know their products better."
5,cant go wrong,its worked well for me you have to use the cable that comes with the device i have only had to use it a few times but seems to work fine.jim
1,450 Pages and Nothing to say,"If you have a great deal of time to waste or a horrible case of insomnia then this book is for you. Unless you have no idea how to spell Windows (even when spotted the w, i, n, d, o, and w) then you probably know or can figure out everything in this book. More an advertisement for Veritas products (that are marginally functional in the real world), this is not the work the world needed.If you want the real world, go out and live it and don't believe the advertising (which is all this book cracks up to be)."
5,Sheena is Fab!,"The selection of disco hits are terrific and there is a nice mix of ballads and dance music. Sheena shows us that she can be successful in both media. ""Don't Leave Me This Way"", ""Giving Up Giving In"", and ""You Never Gave Me the Chance"" (a new song) are prize-winners! You won't be disappointed!"
5,This cd is just what the doctor ordered..,"If you can't stand radio, and you're sick of all the mainstream wimp rock like myself.. I advise you and your friends to get this cd. Its hard, melodic, gripping, emotional and interesting the whole way through. The influence is all over from hot water music to avail, with thrashy vocals and melodic back-ups. Great rhythm and awesome breakdowns..The guitar work is excellent and the song structure will keep you guessing..Sixsouth's ""A Hole Where the Heart Once Beat"" is on my top ten of 2002, no questions asked."
5,Well-Tempered for Everyone,"Having heard Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier by Gould (Sony), Schiff (Decca), Afanasief (Denon), Richter(BMG), Gulda (Phillips)and Nikolayeva (JVC), I find this by Angela most satisfying.To be precise, I appreciate the following features: 1) Extremely well-articulated voice lines, like Nikolayeva. 2) Always aware of rhythmic aspects like Gulda, unlike Richter. 3) Never sound harsh, unlike Gulda. 4) Still can sound ""huge"" in slower fugues, like Richter. 5) Never too personal, unlike Gould.Her playing might sound banal for those who have heard Gould's recordings, but you will find her musical intelligence just impeccable."
5,excellent TV,"Absolutely no regrets. I'm so glad I bought this TV a year and a half ago, since it is very hard to find ambilight TVs nowadays. Great picture. Nice remote. Easy to use. Lots of inputs."
5,Brilliant TV,"I've owned this TV for about a year and a half now and I rate it as am awesome LCD TV. Brilliant picture, excellent sound quality, very good blacks and contrast, which often is lacking in LCDs. Maintenance-free. Why there isn't a 1000 positive reviews of this TV I don't know. The ambilights along the sides add that little extra atmosphere. Plus they make it easier to view the picture in a dark room without eye strain.When I bought this TV I compared its picture quality to others in the showroom and it was superb. It instantly stood out as being the best.Brilliant!!"
2,Bulgarian Rhapsody review,"I am a Bulgarian who has lived in North America for about 35 years. This book is very basic and it is obvious that the author was in Bulgaria during the 90s when food was scarce. To me the book does no justice to bulgarian cooking because it lacks recepiesthat involve lamb and pork which is very important in Bulgaria. The book is O.K. for someone who wants to try out some basic ,every day dishes and get a feel for bulgarian cooking. I was happy to find that the author has included som bulgarian jewish dishes which I am going try."
5,Yummmy Yummmy Yummy,"I am half bulgarian and never actually understand the culture. This book not only teaches you about the culture but has great recipes. I made the lamb moussaka, the green beans with tomatoes and everyone loved it.The bulgarian beef stew though, was too spicy so next time it is safe to use less paprika..:)"
3,Be careful of the height!,"I ordered these to store Red Wine Glasses and they were way too short. It says 8 1/2"", but I think that is the outside measurement. I would measure my glasses and not go above 8 1/4"" tall. That said, the box is cardboard and the exterior is white vinyl. Would have been fine if they fit"
5,China keeper stem-ware,It was exactly what I wanted. Quick to assemble. I would recommend it to a friend. The stem- ware fix exactly.
2,Not as many tracks as listed - different release?,"Not sure if there was more than one release of this CD, however, my copy just arrived today from an Amazon seller and it contains only 11 tracks. Is the Amazon listing incorrect? I'm really disappointed. Mine has: 1. Da ya think I'm sexy; 2. Paradise City; 3. Tears in the Rain; 4. Broken Dreams; 5. Feel good; 6. D.I.S.C.O.; 7. Andare con me; 8. If; 9. Superstition; 10. Amadeus; and 11. The mind of machine."
4,Taylor is Soul Dancing,"What a great cd. I purchased this and listened to it for 9 hours straight over and over driving back from the Christmas Holidays to Florida. It was put together with such power of class. Taylor Dayne was and still is a voice from my past and through my future. Features the songs Soul Dancing, Dont Rush Me, I'll Always Love you, I'll Wait, Shelter, Send Me A Lover, Prove Your Love, How Can You Mend A broken Heart, Cant Get Enough, Tell It To My Heart and my favorite of all time : Love Will Lead You Back ."
4,The best of past albums,"In much anticipation of Taylor Dayne's new CD slated for a November release, this was by far to me her best. I loved her early CD's but I felt this was the most fulfilling one. No fillers, every song I enjoy listening to some 14 years later. I can not wait for the new CD."
4,Great album,"Surprise package. I had only heard the Radiohead 'Just' cover once before and bought the album on spec. A great eclectic mix with a mix of horns, groove, soul and funk."
2,Eclectic mix,"The first song I heard was Valerie featuring Amy Winehouse. I've come to lover her distinctive voice and style. I'm rather enjoying the horns and soulful rhythms.Then I move on to the rest of the album. Hmmmm. Pretty much sounding the same except for the vocal selections. And well, the vocals have a lot to be desired. Not familiar with many of them, nonetheless, not impressed either. Actually put off by some the vocals. Easily could see this has potential, yet at the same time, the various vocals and the same-o musical style can't see me putting this on more than once."
5,Mark,"I enjoyed this album so damn much! He is bringing the soul sound back. If you love music that will not just sample and repeat, listen to Mark. He revisits ""Toxic"" by Britney Spears and it is perfect."
2,Disappointing,"I absolutely LOVED ""Stop Me"" when I first heard it, so I was really interested in hearing the whole album, especially after seeing the songs and vocalists. I'm always intrigued by interesting reworkings of familiar songs.Unfortunately, what sounded so fresh and new on ""Stop Me"" got really tiresome by the end of this disc since it's the same formula on pretty much every song. The same drums, the same horns, the same tambourine.... Sometimes it's hard to tell where one song ends and the next begins.There was a ton of potential on this album, but I don't think it even remotely lived up to it."
5,Stop writing reviews off of one song,"There's nothing worse than someone who rates an ALBUM 1 star when they've only listened to one song. It's okay not to like something but that's like watching 5 minutes of a movie and saying it sucks. It's great that you love the original song, but you totally missed the point. Remaking something isn't supposed to be copying it, what would be the object of that? The concept of this album is to take previously released songs and rework them in the motown flavor. If you don't like the style, you won't like the album but if you do it's amazing as is his previous cd although it's flat out hip hop."
3,Good Music,"I was very excited before receiving this item, and was even more elated when I was actually holding the flawless cop in my hand. It did arrive a little late, but the copy itself did arrive in great condition. The album is a very good soulful mix of fun, and love. I have enjoyed my purchase very much, and would like to hear further music from this artist, and I would purchase again from this purveyor of fine music."
4,"My puppy loves it, my rug is a bit worse for wear","I got a larger one than my puppy probably required, and she loves dragging it around, playing tug of war, and just chewing on it. Unfortunately, it does shed. I don't know if there are rope toys out there that are any sturdier, but this one does leave little threads behind. Otherwise, great toy!"
4,Amazon version is fine,"I ordered this from Amazon (not the other vendors also listed for this product). I paid a few dollars more, but I got what was advertised. The cable worked immediate and appears to be good quality."
4,iLock protection,I needed a USB extension to protect my iLock device. It works perfectly for this purpose! I only wish it were just a little bit shorter...
3,it's ok,"This item functions properly near as I can tell. the only real problem I can find is that it really doesnt look like its 6 inces long. It is, but it seems that they messure it from one connecting end to the other not from one end of the cord it self to the other like they should have. So what you really get is a 4 ince usb cable with a male end and a female end attached to it. other then that its fine."
5,Great for USB flash drives and FOBS on Notebooks,I am always afraid of snapping off (or worse) a USB device plugged into the side of my Laptop. These solve this problem by adding flexability to the device plugged into the side. Now it just flops around when I hit it against something.Great inexpensive insurance!
2,What You See Is Not What You Get,The picture shows a gray cable with male and female USB 2.0 connectors. The female end is not encased in rubber and is totally exposed metal.
5,good seller,"the shipment came quickly, and the contents were all accounted for and just as advertised.thanks"
4,Great product...,Works as expected. Great for when you need a USB drive in your laptop and you're using it on your lap. no worries about damaging the drive or your USB port.
5,They work as advertised!,They do the job just fine. I use them for my dvd player and to extend some components on my pc.
3,Not exactly the cable shown in the picture,"This was purchased from Amazon and not just fulfilled by Amazon.While the functionality is as expected, the female end has much more metal exposed. There is a user supplied photo which shows what the product really looks like. It wouldn't be a big deal except that I specifically picked this one based on the larger plastic shroud around the female end."
1,"It's not white, it's black.","The picture shows a white cable, the item that arrived is black. Not the end of the world, but as a white Macbook owner, with a white Flip video camera, I kind of wanted a white cable and that's why I ordered this one. It's a matter of principal, and of course, Amazon don't make it easy to find the ""problem with this order"" button!"
2,"Adequate, but exposed metal on plug.","I bought this to go with a bulky USB adapter I was purchasing. It serves the purpose, but the female plug has exposed metal (it's not sunken into the plastic.) I don't think it's a problem, just not what I expected. Look closely at the photos before your buy if it might be a problem for you."
1,This is a MALE-MALE cord,"I should have read the reviews. This thing is indeed a male-maleplug. This cord is supposed to handle situations where youcan't plug multiple thick USB devices into closely-spacedUSB sockets. You would use the cords to move the devices a few inchesfrom the computer. But you need a MALE-FEMALE cord for that(just like for any electrical extension cord). A MALE-MALE plugis worthless. I don't know why anyone would even manufacture such things.So I'll see if the return policy works, and hope it isn't too muchof a hassle."
3,Does the Job - - BUT - -,"I bought this extension pigtail to allow me to use a bulky PS2 to USB adapter without blocking several USB ports. It serves the purpose, BUT the female plug has exposed metal (it's not fully covered by the plastic.) That may not be a problem, but I wrapped some electrical tape around the connection anyway. The tape will insulate the connection and also compensate for a slightly loose fit. Look closely at the photos before your buy. Amazon offers several similar USB Extension Cables that have the female plug fully covered for about the same price.Bottom Line - If I had looked closely, and noticed the exposed female plug in the photo, I would have bought this cable insteadMediabridge - USB Extension Cable - A-Male to A-Female - 6 inch"
4,Easier USB plug-in,I bought a Mac and the USB ports are on the back of the monitor. Kind of a pain to get to-- have to move the Mac forward and rotate to use. A friend recommended this USB extension Cable (A-a). I bought 2 six-inch cables. Definitely easier but I will probably wind up getting a longer cable because the six-inch cable barely clears the space between the underside of my Mac and my desktop so I still have to reach around but at least I don't have to move the Mac. (I realize I sound lazy-- but moving the Mac moves all of my papers and items on my desk too ;-D). I forget off-hand what the next size up is... 10 inches or more would be better.
1,6 Inch USB Extension Cable A-A,"Some ""Extension"" cable! With TWO MALE ends, you CAN'T extend any USB cable. Period! This is what this cable has, TWO Male ends. This cable SHOULD have an A-Male end AND an A-Female end to properly perform as an EXTENSION cable of any sort. Sure would have been nice if it had been clearly indicated that this ""extension"" cable ONLY had TWO A-MALE ends."
4,Great so far...,"I bought this little extension cord for a Medialink Bluetooth dongle so I wouldn't have to pull the tiny little thing out every time I put my laptop in its bag - it's much easier to just leave the Bluetooth attached to this cable and yank the cable out instead. It works just perfectly for this purpose; however, as others have noted, the cable I received was not like the one pictured (the pictures with the completely sheathed female end). I don't see it as too big of a deal, but the picture really should be updated so people will know exactly what they're getting.So far the product works perfectly - both the male and female ends have a good tight fit; but if I run into a problem down the road I'll update this review."
3,Does not seem the right fit,"Our grandson was keen on having a pogo stick and after researching them, my husband decided this was the best one and would stand up to lots of use. It is certainly made well and will stand up to lots of use and abuse, but our five and a half-year-old grandson cannot seem to get the hang of how the thing works. We bought the correct size for his age and weight, but it seems too heavy and bulky for him to use and now he has lost interest. I think we ought to send it back and get a refund and find something more traditional for him."
4,Pgog stick?,"My granddaughter asked for a pogo stick for Christmas, and after some online research I thought this was the best out there. When she saw it under the tree, she asked ""What is it?!"" My son quickly added, ""She'll love it once she figures it out!"" So I was a little disappointed in her reaction, but know that when she gets the knack of it it will be durable enough to last for her younger brother to use in a few years. (The adults all thought it was great as soon as they saw it!)"
2,Very Salty!,"I appreciate a few things about this milk, but the off-putting flavor of it overrides the benefits. The first thing I noticed upon opening the can was the strong ""evaporated milk"" odor that you smell when you're using evap. milk from a cow. It's an unpleasant odor no matter the source. When I reconstituted the goat milk according to the directions (1 can milk to one can water) it tasted absolutely DREADFUL like a mouth full of thick, salty grossness. I tried diluting it with approximately 3 more cans of water, which seemed to cut the awful saltiness. What's left is a slight ""barnyard"" taste/smell with a little salt on the side. I imagine it might be alright if it's mixed in something, but it's certainly no substitute for the flavor of cow's milk. I would only use this product for cooking if I absolutely had to."
1,Not for me,"This tastes like sour grass. I ordered it by mistake --- the powdered milk is delicious, wonderful, but the evaporated milk, even amended, watered,mixed with fresh goat's milk, is astringent, and hard."
5,GOAT MILK .... IT IS THE BEST,IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO FIND THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS NOT SOLD IN THE STORES AROUND HERE IN NEW ENGLAND.THIS IS THE BEST GOAT MILK THAT I HAVE TASTED IN A LONG TIME AND IT IS DELICIOUS. I RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO LIKES OTHER THAN COW MILK
1,Really gross,I tried this product and it had the most horrible taste. I really thought it would taste nice. This is the first time I have ever tasted Goat milk though. Very strong taste. My advice is buy one can and see if you like it first. I have extra goat milk that I or my family will not drink. I plan to use it in making homemade soap so that I get some use from it.
1,price increase,"I have been ordering this at a lower price and now they increase the price. I won't be ordering through here anymore, it is cheaper to go to the store."
5,Easier than grinding soybeans.,"I can not have cow milk so I was doing the soybean method but there is no vitamin D and low Calcium. I decided I would give this product a try.Yeah it did at first have the hair of the goat after taste, but like anything else in life you stop noticing it in a very short period of time.I use one 12 OZ can of the goats milk to make a gallon of milk as I like my milk on the thin side and even with all the water I add to make the gallon the milk is still a good consistency where thickness of the milk is concerned.I am very happy I decided to go this route and I use this product in my homemade recipes with no complaints."
1,Goats milk,"Our regular powdered goats milk was out of stock so I took a gamble on the evaporated milk for my daughter. She is allergic to cows milk and can only drink goats milk. I was going to use it for her to drink in her bottle. I mixed the milk with equal parts water and put it in her bottle. She absolutely hated the taste!! I tried adding liquid goats milk to the bottle, but she still did not take it. I do not recommend evaporated milk for drinking. The taste is not the same and actually made my daughter sick."
5,Great for kittens...,I found some abandoned tiny kittens. I could hardly get them to drink Kitten Milk Replacer but the Meyenberg evaporated goat's milk they love. Just don't forget to dilute it by half. If you use the straight evaporated milk it will give them diarrhea.
4,"Excellent product, but not for replacing drinking milk","This is a very good alternative for people who have difficulty digesting cow's milk, but keep it to mixing in your coffee or baking/cooking needs. Just like evaporated regular milk it is not really suitable to reconstitute and drink normally or use in cold cereal (it's great in oatmeal and cream of wheat though!). If you are looking for a drinkable version I recommend the powdered variety offered by the same company."
1,Overrated,"This CD isn't a masterpiece, it's not good, and it even isn't mediocre. It's just BAD.It might be somewhat good if you're loaded and in a club or something, but it doesn't add, in my humble opinion, anything to the, I have to say, non-inspired genre of trance.Sorry, but the music in it can best be described as music for in a toilet, or an elevator, it actually has a positive influence on the intestinal transition, that is what makes it somewhat earn my one-star rating. I have too agree with Mike Blegh on this one."
1,Dissapointment,"I've got this Cd from my girlfriend, and I like trance, but this is basically your 'run-of-the-mill' bull***t. I think a computer made this CD. DJ in-Tiestins made the ultimate toilet CD. Tantrix is inspired by Jean-M Jarre, when he was 5 year old. Golden desert would better be called 'inspiration desert', the michael wood remix didn't live up to its name, it didn't give me any. An angel maybe saved his life, but not this Cd. Dj is still a good alternative to cleaning toilets, although not much better. Don't bother to import this Cd, the situation in the US is already bad enough. Can't wait for Search of Sunrise 3. Such trash only makes me angry."
5,A Magikal Journey,"This is not an album, it is an adventure. Thousands of years from now when they look back at the music at the dawn of the 21st century, they will undoubtedly hear this brilliant and gourgeous music. Words truly cannot express Tiesto's brilliance. I hope you trust me and the thousands of others who have heard it and will never be the same. Start the journey with this...."
5,Blegh Reaction,"Okay, I understand that you don't like trance music. But that's your opinion which I respect. But what's the point then, that you start rating (or should I say under-rating) the best trance dj there is.If you don't like trance music then don't listen to it, but don't start spraying off bad words about Tiesto. Just put on your favourite Britney Spears or Backstreet Boys record and write reviews about them. Let the real fans judge about the quality of trance 'n club cd's."
5,Pefection has been reached!,"In Search of Sunrise 2 is probably the best trance cd ever made. Tiesto mixes the songs with perfection, making himself one of the best dj's out there at the moment. Number one was great, number two is perfect. Anyway : BUY THIS CD. It will be the best buy of the year."
4,A Marvelous Album for DJ Tisto,"This is a great album mixed by one of the hottest DJs in Europe, if you like trance, and if you've heard other stuff from DJ Tisto, like ""Live at Innercity"" or the first volume of ""In Search of Sunrise"" you'll find this one not as Magikal as the two mentioned before, but it's good enough. I recommend you get this one if you liked the first ""In Search of Sunrise""."
5,Can he really do that!?,Enlightenment is all I can say about this amazing DJ from Holland. He threw down one of the most ridiculous mixes of trance anthems ive heard yet. This mix is essential to any trance junkie like myself!
3,Good but not great,"In all fairness, I'd like to disclose up front that I am a big Tiesto fan therefore my opinions might not be fully impartial. In my opinion, many of Tiesto's previous works deserve the full five star treatment. However, I truly felt that this album came short when compared to other Tiesto mixes like the Magik series and especially ""In Search of Sunrise I."" As usual, Tiesto's mixing skills are way off the charts. He weaves the tracks together seamlessly. But the track selection in this album was not as good as previous works. That's not to say that this album is total junk. In fact, there's some very good tracks in it. But somehow, the whole thing doesn't fall together neatly. Regardless, I would recommend this album to those who appreciate awesome mixing as much as the track selection like I do. Here is my breakdown: Mixing: 10/10 (as usual for Tiesto) Track selection: 7/10 Sequencing: 10/10 Overall: ((10+7+10)/3))/10 = 9/10"
2,poor,"Very pleased with the promptness of delivery. However, the CD is damaged. The quality of the CD is fine, with the exception of one track, which happened to be the track that I purchased the CD for. It is faulty and does not play - I was very disappointed"
3,"Plausible, but understated and unsafe","Assuming a layperson to chemistry could perform all the steps outlined in this book, they would still put themselves at risk. This book suggests utilizing a variety of corrosive and/or combustible chemicals to produce illegal narcotics. The reactions are understated by the author, and any reader shouldn't assume they will be able to yield a clean product easily, if at all. It suited the needs of my research into the manufacture of methamphetamine, but, legal aspects aside, I wouldn't attempt any of the reactions."
1,not for the common person,if you have a chem degree this book is great..but with a degree you don't need the book..way too tech for the above average high school grad
4,Loved the book but some downfalls!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read Total Synthesis 2. In the book strike tells the reader, Step by Step, How to prefrom the manufactor of MDA, MDMA, MDEA, and whatever. I think tweak. All I wanted was to see the MDA/MDMA. (XTC) :)Anyhow, I have not tried anything he wrote but I learned alot from his writings and could picture step by step what to get and how to do it. He has Pictures to show you what things look like and what to buy.The only thing I did not like in this book is that some of his examples on synthesising these drugs are NOT TESTED and really have NO MERIT. If he did not perform the operations how would he really know they work in further case why even write them down and sell it in a book.Thanks Strike, Great book"
3,My review is going to sound just like everybody else's,"Yes, this was a very entertaining and informative book and just like everyone said, sometimes, hard to follow. You would defiantly need some chemistry knowledge to know (and accomplish) what is in this book. Luckily what is needed to know, one can easily find out. If you are into underground, this book is a must have. Also Strike makes very good references to other ""must have"" books and articles. I love everything ""underground"" so this book is right up there with the best of them."
3,"An entertaining, easy read","As always with Edna Buchanan's Britt Montero novels, this one is a fun read, quick and easy, and not exactly thought-provoking. Though the plot isn't as strong as some of her other books, the ending is powerful, and the characters are as interesting as ever. However, if you haven't read her other Britt Montero books, I wouldn't start with this one. Buchanan doesn't bother with very much character development for the main figures, and this isn't one of her strongest books."
3,Entertaining enough,"For some reason I thought this book was a fantasy but I soon discovered it's a mystery. Mysteries usually don't hold my attention but this one managed to.This book is apparently smack in the middle of a long ongoing series but the references to the earlier books didn't throw me too much although I think I would've found a deeper connection to many of the characters if I had read the earlier books first. Still, this was an attention grabbing murder mystery about a journalist following a cold case. The characterization was done very well and I genuinely cared for many of these people but when the big bad guy of the novel is finally revealed in the end it was a huge disappointment and simply unbelievable to me that the police hadn't figured it out long before. This is a dark book with a lot of pain suffered by most of the characters and adding to that is the fact that it takes place right after the 911 attacks. Don't read this if you need some cheering up!"
3,Good diversion but Nothing Special,"I think I should start off and say that I am not a ""mystery reader"" as such. I don't follow a particular series and this is the only mystery I have read by Edna Buchanan. I found the read to be quick and diverting. However, I found some of her ""fringe"" characters more intriguing than her main characters. In fact---I wanted to know more about Sunny's parents and what makes them tick. Also Ms. Buchanan never made me care who raped Sunny and killed her boyfriend. I had no problem setting this book aside a while and coming back. Also I couldn't help but see her detective as a watered down version of Cornwall's Kay Scarpetta. And when the ""bad guy"" is finally found, I found it very unlikely in the sense that it wasn't solved by the police years ago. Short way to put it: Not believable. But the book is worth a read if you want something light and quick. If you want to almost grieve when the book ends----this is not a good choice."
4,Life Isn't Fair,"The wrong people die in this book. Good people suffer. Bad people prosper. And it all happens in the aftermath of 9/11. THE ICE MAIDEN is about surviving, about getting past life's monumental injustices and taking the good that's left. The mystery itself -- what happened to beautiful young Sunny Hartley and her boyfriend Ricky in that field on Christmas Eve so many years ago -- is brutal and sad and includes a shocking plot twist. This installment in the Britt Montero series expands our heroine's love life and work relationships in very credible, very moving ways. I recommend this for those who want a book that's about more than the crime that's a catalyst for the storytelling."
3,Not Buchanan's best,"I have read all Edna Buchanan's Britt Montero books, and I eagerly looked forward to reading The Ice Maiden. It was a quick read, perhaps too quick. The primary mystery is taut, but the secondary plot falls flat. The last 15 pages of the book seem to have been written by the author just to finish the book and give it a wingding ending, a tease to make us look for the next chapter of Montero's life in the next book. It made the book seem shorter than it really was."
2,Not Edna's best Britt Montero book,"The character development in Ice Maiden didn't seem to be quite up to par in this book by Edna Buchanan. I never really could get a good sense of who the Sunny character was supposed to be and I never felt any empathy for her or the ordeal she went through. Same with her parents, the boy's parents, or the boy himself. The frequent references to 9/11 tended to date the book as well. Usually the Britt Montero books are ageless, now I will be forever classifying them as pre or post 9/11 and expecting dates, seasons, etc. to ""match"" up to something. The extra-marital affair that was exposed at the end came from no-where-land and added nothing to the storyline. Same with the house explosion and the death of a recurring character. Sorry, Edna, it just wasn't there for me with Ice Maiden."
4,Wiring kit was as described,"Purchased this wiring harness for Ford Focus 2001 -- installed without a hitch but you'll need both the antenna and faceplate kit sold separately (which I did purchase at the same time). Wiring harness was not self explanatory but if you compared the number of wires you would install the set correctly (both harnesses are the same, so keep your eyes peeled when installing). Ford power harness is a different size but fit into the power harness for the stereo when you match up the notches. 15m install."
5,Love it!,"I love it! It is exactly as it appears in the picture. Goes with anything - You can dress it up or dress it down. Classy, chic, simple and fun. Great buy."
3,Supper Club presents Lounge,"It's music played in the Amsterdam restaraunt of the same name, so if you like what they play you'll like the CD. There are some good songs, but really it's background music - but if like me you are a big fan of this incredibly cool restaurant then it is worth it just for the beatifully presented CD case with pictures of the inside - own a souvenir of Amsterdam culture!"
5,The Golden horseshoe,This has to be the best book on U-boats tactics to come out of ww2. The fact that Otto Kretschmer was the leading Ace of ww2 and led the way for others to follow makes this a must must have for my collection.
1,Poor Quality DVD,This particular DVD is of poor quality. Westlake Entertainment has offered up one of the worse copies that I have seen.This is a must have Bogie film but not from this studio.....
3,its average,"i bought it because i collect humphery bogart dvd,s its not one of his better movies , "" the african queen "" was one of his best movies"
1,weak performance by Bogart,"Bogart seems tired and ill in this film. Black and white shooting is very poor also, looks as if the director and crew just wanted a vacation in Italy and decided to make a film to accomplish it. But, Jennifer Jones gives an acceptable rookie performance and it is a required addition to any ""Bogy"" collection."
3,"""In 6 states these LYRICS are considered dumb"" is what","...should have been sung on the first track. Really, what could have been a decent sound is marred by high school poetic spouting. Only on ""Tension (Piano Verite)"" do they pass off as non-whincing material. The style is like taking the voice of the singer from the 12 Rods and putting it over ""The Soft Bulletin"". Nothing too new.Still, the song writing is very good considering it is from indie electronica camp of The Postal Service. Just try to faze out the subject matter and maybe you'll like it."
4,A solid theological work.,"Dr. Miller's book, Sexuality and Authority in the Catholic Church, is a well developed study on the meaning of masculine and feminine authority in the Church. She explores the true meaning of what it is to be a woman in today's Church, and how that vocation holds vital importance to the life of the Catholicism. With the modern criticisms of the Church on the issue of women's ordination, Dr. Miller's books strikes down the feminist arguement with solid theology. Dr. Miller's book is an exploration on the dignity of woman and is an interesting theological work and I highly suggest it!"
5,Unique,"These African-American slave songs tell the stories passed down through oral traditions. Each illustration is a fabric collage illustration, which is quite beautiful. I only knew one of the dozen songs. A sound CD accompanies the book. The author tells her personal connection to each song after presenting each song's words. The music is in the back."
4,Versatile Classroom Tool,"I purchased six of these and use them to guide students through games and other activities in my classroom. Vocabulary review, grammar review, conversation creators, etc. The kids love them. I just wish I had more places to hang them around the room! That way groups aren't too big and don't limit the opportunities for student participation."
3,The JGB Has Done Much Better,"OK. I'm a weirdo. I dig the JGB more than the Dead. But this CD falls short of bringing people the best the JGB has to offer. Sure, there are some prime cuts, like Don't Let Go, but there's many a better version out there, from this same era, than what was put on this CD. I know Jerry's picky, but, man....he could have done MUCH better! The only thing I can really say is great about this disk is that versions were picked where Melvin is kickin' some serious booty. I can see the Jello jigglin' all the way from here as he lays into them keys and the fat rolls ripple on the back of his neck! Jackie & Gloria are also spotlighted with lots of ""Whooh"" and ""Oh""'s thrown in aside from the usual vocals. Sure, it's nice to have, but Jerry could have done much, much better...."
4,"Excellent, electric set from JGB.","This disc set include some of the most powerful and moving music created by Grateful Dead lead-guitarist/guru Jerry Garcia. While often slower than its Dead counterpart, the JGB packs a puch with a soulful, almost gospel feel of their music. Of particlar interest, the Dead standard ""Deal"" is fully explored; Lennon's ""Dear Prudence"" is also taken to its limits. This is an essential example of what a JGB show was like, and Garcia's spirit comes shining through very clearly. Definitely recommended!"
5,So Good!!!,"Oh my! One of my favorite live recordings of all time. Such sweet renditions of past favorites. All musicians shine in this live recording and a rejuvenated Garcia leads the pack. Tracks such as Lucky Old Sun, I Shall Be Released, and Simple Twist of Fate will leave you spell bound. Grooves such as Tangled Up in Blue, Don't Let Go, and especially Deal will make you dance weather you like it or not. Every track is excellent. Honestly one of the best live recordings I've ever heard."
5,I can't stop listening,"This album just keeps getting better from beginning to end. The band tightens up as the show progresses and you can tell they're really feeling the music. Jerry's voice is pretty damn good here considering the time period. There's not one song on this album I don't love. It's a lot more mellow than The Dead, but you'll fall right into the groove, especially if you've smoked a little something. I have to say, the backup singers are the MVP's of this album."
2,Big Disappointment,"I tried to stay with this book to the end, but alas, I tossed it with only about 20 pages left. By this time the plot had become so byzantine that I no longer cared who did what. Furthermore, I was getting pretty sick and tired of the sophomoric and unrealistically silly dialog that ran all through the book. The relationship between Moon and the FBI lady, for instance, was like something out of a novel for teenagers. In other words, the book lacked credibility. Doss falls short, I'm afraid, of even a mediocre Hillerman book. Hillerman weaves in the rich and mystical lore of the Indian culture quite effectively. His dialog is pitch perfect, not contrived, as in this book. And, as another reviewer noted, I was put off by Doss's maddening habit of witholding clues and information through the book. I was looking forward to a good read, but all in all, it turned out to be a very flawed book."
1,The Witch's Tongue,"The Charlie Moon series is getting more amusing and more ""spiritual"", for lack of a better word, as it evolves. Certainly, Moon has become a more interesting character. He was always more interesting than the earlier protaganist in the series Scott Parris. I enjoy the series but it is not my favorite reading. I find hiding of clues and information from the reader irritating."
4,A thought provoking tale,"People of faith believe that their commitment to that faith is strong and can endure even the greatest challenges to it. When it is tested, they stand firm, never waivering but suppose that your faith could cause suffering and even death to others. To watch others die over and over again because of what you believe would wear on the beliefs of the strongest of individuals.Rodrigues has his faith tested to its limits. The frustration he faces brings him through a journey of relationships with simple people who risk all for him and others who betray him at every turn. In the midst of it all, God is ""silent""...This is no ""feel good"" read but it will move you and cause you to think about your own faith."
5,"Disturbing, yet beautiful","This is not a book for the faint of heart. It looks at the question of a ""good"" God allowing so much pain and suffering in this world. The answer that it offers I found to be disturbing, yet beautiful. It may be a more honest answer than we'd like to admit. I recommend it highly."
5,Dark Nights of the Soul,"I have just finished reading this book and I am moved to such depths as I didn't know existed.Endo, in his inimitable way, takes us into dark and treacherous waters: into an examination, indeed a portrait, of what lies beyond the end of faith. The questions he raises are questions all people of faith should consider for themselves, though whether we can be as honest as the protagonist, Father Rodrigues, is will remain a secret known only to ourselves.This book, more than all of Endo's fine novels, takes the reader on a journey to encounter God in ways that may prove unsettling, but worthy of the effort all the same.If you read only one book in your whole life, read this one."
3,Christian Persecution in Japan,"I didn't exactly enjoy 'Silence,' it isn't one of those books that is meant to bo enjoyed. I did, however, learn a lot from it. This is an area of history that I don't know much about and it opened my eyes to what happened during that dark period of Japanese history. It is, for the most part, well-written, however, the end drags a bit and I lost some interest in the book towards the end of it. It is still a good book though, and a very important one."
2,Overestimation of natives vs. Underestimation of foreiners,"As author stated in the preface of ""The Life of Jesus"", he is for ""Japanese readers who have no Christian tradition of their own and who know almost nothing about Jesus""1. Two Roman Catholic priets/missionaries from Portugal crossing dangerous oceans to reach Japan. Then giving up everything:Pride,faith, freedom, and love(?)2. Courageous Native Christians. Accepting their martyrdom with silence.There is no balance between these two. There is no reality.This is a book written by a Japanese for Japanese readers."
4,"Disturbing, but in a good way.","This is a profound exploration of the limits of a man's faith under extreme persecution. The events of the story will stay with you long after you have finished the novel. It's a very disturbing book, especially on the subjects of persecution, sacrifice, and ultimately apostasy. Bring a friend and have a nice long discussion."
5,Inspiration,Silence STIMULATED me to practice my Religion more faithfully. I feel Silence is uplifting and a tremendous source of inspiration.
5,Silence,"When this book was selected by my book club, I did not want to read it. Christians being tortured in 17th century Japan. Also, it seemed very Catholic to me and I am not a Catholic. It just didn't sound good. When I finally overcame my reluctance and started to read it, I found myself mesmerized by the beautiful writing, the sense of time and place and, surprisingly by the story itself. By the time I finished the book, I found myself profoundly moved and forever changed by the questions and conclusions it posed. A book that I did not want to read has become one of my all-time favorite books. I suspect I will still be thinking about it until the day I die."
3,THIS CD IS COOL,"IF YOU DONT LIKE THE OULAWZ AND 2PAC YOU PROBABLY WONT LIKE THIS ONE. I FEEL LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWER, ITS A GOOD CD, THERES BETTER ONES OUT THERE, BUT IF YOU HAVE A COUPLE EXTRA DOLLARS GO BUY IT. ITS NOT A GREAT ONE LIKE ALL EYES ON ME, BUT ITS TIGHT. I LIKE BIG SYKE, BUT I REALLY WISH HIM AND THE OULAWZ WOULD MAKE A CD TOGETHER. MY FAVORITE TRACK ON IT IS HIGHDOLLAZ"
3,-good album,"--nuthin amazing thatll make u wanna go rush and pick this up, but its a solid buy if u like the outlawz and 2pac. No songs with 2pac on this but hes still got a plenty of good tracks on his own thatll entertain u for a while. Ultimately,inless your a big fan of the outlawz and gave the other solo albums a 4 or 5, you wont find anything amazing here. If you gots a few extra $$ to throw around,get this, but theres also a lot of better stuff out there- my suggestion is wait for the outlawz album or wait for the new syke one. Youre not missin anything that great if you dont buy this, but if you do,youll like it for a few months"
4,Music lover,Had her music in phonograph format collection. Compare audio quality from CD and my record player showed very similiar which indicated high quality reproduction. Recomment to anyone whose interest in it.
5,The Best Darn Book on DSL you'll ever read.,"The authors have a done a nice job of presenting the case for DSL. I live in an area where the RBOCS have bruised out the CLECS with flying elbow tactics. Armed with this book, I will now call up those bastards and demand that they install DSL in my neighborhood. Will you have a Chinese version coming out? Best consumed with prodigious amounts of durian..."
5,Probably something you have already.,This is the Ralph Gleason/Dave Brubeck Jazz Casual dvd with the addition of Emily played in concert by Desmond and 3 tracks (possibly from another Jazz Casual?) by the Shorty Rogers Group. The music is great but the old wine/new bottle concept should have been mentioned.
5,They Need To Make More,"""The Blue Room"" EP can also be called Coldplay's third, not second EP, as some people might think (Brothers & Sisters and Safety were the first). Secondly, this is probably one of the best CD's that Coldplay have made so far. Don't get me wrong, Parachutes was just as good. But I had just one disappointment. See, I just got into Coldplay about a year ago, and then I discovered this EP, heard some sample songs, and thought ""WOW! I want to get this one!"". But, there was a problem. This is an extremely limited edition EP that came out in 1999 and it is hard to find now. Even if you do find it, it costs a lot of money (Anywhere from [$$$]). I think that that is the only real disappiontment about this EP. They should re-realase it here in the US. They need to make more!!"
2,Regan was right! Just say no.,"Stick with X&Y; for your one-hit-wonders. This EP sucks. Maybe they just need to switch to Coplandia, as this effort is one bad trip.-Dr.Q"
5,AMAZING ALBUM!!,"I absolutely love this album. I already owned the songs, but owning the CD with it's case just feels so much better. It's a rare album, there are not too many copies of it out there. I'm sooo happy to be an owner of this album."
5,what can i say,"Coldplay does it again... what can I say. Great album (maybe not their best, but a very good listen)."
3,"Good Book, I recomend it.","""Manchester Unlimited"" has controversial issues that deal with businesses with the soccer club. Also the rise and fame the of the club. Not only did one man change the team but others also. Martin Edwards, the chief executive of the soccer club may not be a popular guy in England, but he made what Manchester United is today. I recomend this book to people who are into business and sports, because it's not a book about soccer, it's a book of business dealing with the soccer club."
2,Explosive? I think not,"This book seriously undermines the exciting, exhilarating, thrill one receives from watching a United game. While it tells the reader of United's rise to the top from an economic point of view, it does so in a banal way. After a few pages the reader is highly tempted to put the book down. The tale never takes off and Bose throws so many names at you, that the reader no longer can tell who is on the executive board at Manchester United, or who is the former CEO of BSkyB. If you truly want to learn about Manchester United, save the money you plan to spend on this book, and put it towards a plane ticket to Manchster, England, and a ticket to Old Trafford."
3,Interesting Economic View on Soccer,"The book is very well written, with exciting econpomic moves by the executives from Manchester United.It shows how big soccer is in the world and how much power Manchester really has. I am a soccer fan but not really into economics and because of that i wasn't very thrilled with this book. I recommend it to people that like soccer, are familiar with Manchester United and are interested in the economics and business behind the world's richest soccer club."
3,manchester,I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN. I AM A MANU. FAN BUT I FOUND THE BOOK A LITTLE BORNING. I THINK I PREFER WATCHING THE GAMES. THOUGH THE STEPS TAKEN TO MAKE THIS CLUB THE RICHEST WAS INTERESTING.
4,"Great pictures, exciting for babies and toddlers","The Priddy books in this series are great. This one is nice because it not only has the great, bright, big pictures but also has different rescue professionals doing things with their cool helicopters, ambulances, etc.... The ""action"" shots seemed to really excite my daughter and her buddies. Stury board book, large for when they want a big bold book."
3,Nice Pictures but not fun to read,"The pictures in this book are nice and my son liked looking at it but when he wanted me to sit with him and go through the pictures, it was torture. There are just too many and it just isn't any fun to read this to a child. I always tried to discourage this one when we were selecting books. I donated it - hopefully to annoy another parent!"
4,Very good book on revival,"This is an excellent first-hand account of Goforth's experiences as he preached throughout China and saw the Lord use him in miraculous ways. My only disappointment with the book is that I wish he had spent more time detailing his thoughts on revival and why the Lord was able to use him so effectively. He does deal with this briefly in the last chapter, but the majority of the book is simply descriptions of his experiences."
5,The best sea salt by far!,"Once you try Maldon sea salt, there truely is no going back. I always thought, try one sea salt and you've tried them all. NOT SO. Maldon is the favorite of many professional chefs for a reason. It's simply superior to all the others. Tasting is believing."
5,Move Over Hannibal Lector!,"Kevin J. Porter's Come Clean is meta-fiction mystery at its best. In the grand tradition of the PI and police procedure, Porter treats the reader to a whodunit that keeps the reader guessing until the very end. In a twist from tradition, the reader is one step ahead of PI Porter and the Canadian Mountie working on the case, but a few steps behind the author in figuring out who, among a whole range of possible suspects, could be the killer. I call this ""meta-fiction"" because of the fact that the writer is Kevin Porter and the PI is Kevin Porter and in the book, the PI is writing a novel. Sound twisted? It is. It's also suspenseful and decidedly good enough to be made into a movie. In fact read about the movie in The Independent Gay Writer. You'll need to be an online sleuth to find this e-zine. -Ronald L. Donaghe, author of Common Sons"
2,"Lame, but I suppose for lighthearted Teen Drama it's alright","*Sigh* I signed up for a play.. this play, in my private school last March, believe me it's nothing artistic, it seems more like an afterschool special/Christian network type of production, but it's just fine if it's used for what it was meant for. Lighthearted, Christian ""Drama""."
1,stinks,"this product stinks--first,it has a rubber cover that doesn't even fit the phonesecond-the plastic hard cover falls off when you pick upthe phone--utterly useless product"
4,over all bang for ur buck,Works great. There's few minor issues of keeping it on when in your pocket and sliding it in and out but beats breaking ur phone and great value for the price
2,ehhhh,Dont like this product! It doesnt fit my phone like it should so it doesnt protect it!! On the up side... this thing got to my house the very next day!!! So 5 stars for delivery 2 stars for the product.
1,Galaxy note cover,"Very bad quality, not even look like the photo,The cover barely fits the phone. Material is very poor.Regret that I purchased it"
2,Not a good case,I bought this case cause I just needed one so I didnt care. I wish I hadn't because even though its big and protective the hard plastic outer is always falling off and slipping and it presses the buttons. It just isn't a good quality case.
5,Great Card,"I just got this card for christmas to upgrade from my 128MB ATI radeon 128MB and so far im loving it. On Counter Strike i usally got 40 Frames Per Second im now getting 100 Frames Per Second. Also very easy to install, took around 20 mins and it was up and running. Great Card and i recomened it."
1,Could not install,"Spent 4+ hours trying to install this on Christmas day 2006. I am not a geek but am good with PCs.Tried the cd driver install, tried the website driver install, tried the remove everything and do it over again install. Nothing worked.Maybe a bad unit. Would not buy Nvidia again, going back to ATIshortgamer"
2,Hard as Nails!,"I would not recommend this product as it peels off within one day after application. When you try to remove the rest of the polish, you need a hammer and chisel to get it off. I had to get out the sponge with the green scrubber, and I still have streaks of color on my nails."
3,a rare opportunity to see this unfamiliar operetta,"Although Kalman's 1924 COUNTESS MARITZA is still staged today in English-speaking countries, his 1926 CIRCUS PRINCESS is apparently not produced in these countries, hence available primarily through this recently released DVD with English subtitles. An unusual tale of a Prince, who joins a circus after being disowned for proposing to the wrong Princess, this is a 1973 film made for German television by dubbing a studio recording sound track acted during panning long shots and then edited into the movie. Despite a clumsy editing job, it is worth seeing superstars Ingeborg Hallstein as the jilted Princess who accidentally finds him in the circus, and Rudolf Schock as the protagonist Prince. The film may hold little interest to a general audience not familiar with these star names and not operetta groupies."
1,It's leaking!!!,"It looks like a good gift for baby shower. But the first one I got is a mess. The lotion or shampoo was leaking. Not just a little, lots white lotion or shampoo on the bag and plush goat. I thought it's some thing wrong during transit and I was glad I ordered it much early than the shower so I asked replacement.Unfortunately the replaced one still leaking! The white leaked shampoo inside and outside the clear plastic secure seal on the top of shampoo. On the inner part of gift bag, I can see some small black sticky dots. I can't give it as a shower gift. I had to return it."
4,"Nashville, eat your heart out!","While Nashville digs itself into deepening pits of corporate pop, here comes a moody Frenchman to save the day. Francis Cabrel's sophisticated folk minimalism, with its slight country tinge, represents a timeless musical standard by which Nashville artists should be judged.Though he may not be the greatest songwriter, Cabrel's dreamy arrangements and interpretations are absolutely breath-taking and deserve a standing ovation.Only Alison Krauss can deliver music of comparable purity."
5,A Perfect CD,"I'm not kidding, this is a great CD. I first heard Cabrel while living in Germany, and I was hooked. This was the first CD I could get my hands on after coming back to the states. Believe me, it's no disappointment. All the mellow stuff you (hopefully) have come to love is here, as well as the Cabrel-esque, meaningful faster tunes. This is great! I'm extremely glad I have access to his music here!"
3,Two good tracks save me from listing this on half.com,"I loved Up to tha Wildstyle, and Up to no Good (Don Dapper), when they were cuts on other compilations. And this group figured that those songs were catchy enough to merit a whold CD. It's in my genre, but the songs I already owned were simply resold to me! I'm sorry to tell you that the same formula that made the afore mentioned HITS was lost in the making of the rest of the album. If you, like me, are going for this CD based on one of those other tracks, you would do much better to seach for the other 'good' track on a compilation and end up with more good dance tracks, which you won't find here.I hate writing bad reviews, but I honestly think I would have appreciated a warning on this one."
3,This book doesn't include the Adirondacks,"Given the title of the book, I was assuming that it would contain trail descriptions for all of New York State, but it only covers the metropolitan area of the state and it does NOT cover the Adirondacks as the other review claims (nor Finger Lakes or western New York etc.).This is a list of places this book actually covers (from the back cover): New York city, Long Island, Westchester County, Fahnestock State Park, East Hudson Highlands, Dutchess county, the Southern Taconics, the Catskills, the Shawangunk Mountains, Schunemunk Mountain, Storm King and Black Rock Forest, Bear Mountain - Harriman State Parks, Rockland County, Sterling Forest.The trail descriptions seem very precise but there is no difficulty level/estimated time/altitude gradient, just the length is indicated.The illustrations are nice and there are some decent maps at the end."
4,enjoyable book,"There wasn't much information about his childhood, but overall it was a very good book. It did a nice job of communicating what kind of man he was."
5,m-m-m-h-h-h!!!,"Blackhawk is a great band. Rockin' in the Ottumwa Colliseum was unforgettable. Too bad country music can't get off their butts and pay better attention. Keep up the good work, I'm buying your tunes and promoting from this end. Love ya, MC."
1,Not what it appears,The disc I received was brand new in the wrapper. When I opened the case everything seemed OK. Then I started playing the disc and the songs on the disc were not the correct ones. It appears that the wrong album was burned to the CD. With the low cost of the CD it wasn't worth the trouble to try to return it. Lesson learned.
4,More from Silent,"HMC's fourth album. This is slightly different from 'In The Garden Of Eden' to me not quite as musical, don't get me wrong - the music on this is quite beautiful - but as a piece of individual music I don't think it is quite as strong as the early Garden stuff. But like anything produced by Kim Cascoin - it is a must have album for anyone who enjoys true ambient/electronica classic music. Plus this is possibly an easier one to get hold of, so if you can buy it at a reasonable price do so, you will not be sorry."
1,do not buy this bag!,"this bag is not good, though it looks the same as the pic! Pay attention, it is made of leather-like material! not leather!! and this company does not accept any return except damage in the delivery! how bad this return policy is!! what's more, this company looks only one person! the compony contact method is a personal email box in gmail!!!!!!!!!!!! do not trust this kind of company!! No any return!!"
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"I love the look of these shoes, but they are probably one of my *least* comfortable."
4,"Well structered, provocative reference work","A well researched reference, providing solid basis of evaluating most issues surrounding clusters and the supporting/participating infrastructure. Naturally some of the more complex subjects are not always discussed in as much detail as you would like - but that was not the purpose of the book. Good value for money, highlighting most issues."
2,I can barely hear Chuck,"I have to contradict the other review. I thought it was shot fine, but the sound was not good. Moe is a two guitar band and I believe the strength of the band is the way the two guitar players play off each other. On the DVD, Al is real loud, but Chuck's guitar is almost completely inaudible. This is a real big disappointment to me. I really like moe, but I would not recomend this DVD except for those who have to have it. It's a real shame."
4,Great Jam Band,"I happened to catch the last song of this concert on HD Theater channel and liked it enough to buy this DVD. I had heard of Moe before, but never checked out their material. I don't understand how I haven't heard more about them - they are an awesome jam band. And the video and audio quality on this DVD are very good. Highly recommended if you like talented instrumental jam sessions."
3,moe. DVD review,"The quality of the sound and video is great on this DVD. I think the show is pretty average but this is the only moe. DVD, so if you want to see them live buy this DVD or go to a concert."
5,"Good, in any language","Even if you don't understand French, or if it's as rusty as mine, this album is fantastic! Smooth rhymes, interesting and unique rhythms, this album keeps your toes tapping and your head thinking. There is just something about the quality of the music that speaks to something beyond your conscious self.There are many great tracks on here, My faves: Solaar Pleure, Baby Love and La Belle et Le Bad Boy."
3,Good but not slamming like old MC Solaar CD's,"MC Solaar is one of my favorite Hip-Hop artists period. This one isn't as good as the other CD's but I'd also like to point out that the other albums were seriously slamming in my opinion, so just putting out a good album isn't a bad thing. He changes his style on this one and it seems like he has a different production crew from that on the ""La Tour De La Question"". Trax, beats and lyrics are still tight. Amazing to hear how he can go from one style to the other on the same album. Alliance Ethnik is the only French Group that seems to have figured it out. Get this one but understand that if you have his previous CD's, this one will need to grow on you."
5,fabulous,"Actually, I didn't hear about this CD from ""Sex and the City."" I originally became familiar with his music three years (at age 18) ago while I was with some French friends camping in the French Alps. MC Solaar is a gifted and widely respected musician who has wonderful music. This CD has a little something for everyone-- nice and slow or good to get that groove on to. I'm glad that ""Sex and the City"" helped raise people's awareness of him."
5,c'est cool ca,"qu'il soit cool!! j'aime bien mc solaar, un vrai <star>.il est le meilleur rappeur francais du monde"
5,Mc Solaar keeps on,"I have 4 Mc Solaar albums and I don't understand one word of french. In my opinion his production and lyrical flow are unmatched. In Cinquieme his style has changed a bit from previous albums but he maintains his excellence. I suggest that any fan of rap purchase this CD, its worth any price!"
2,misguided fools,"Deltron Z? Automator? Kook Keith? Hip-hop in the U.S. is alive and kicking. ""Intelligent"" rap won't find itself on the dancefloor, which is why mainstream rap exists, whereby Tupac, Biggie Small, Emimem, Ice Cube, etc... dominate. If you want to hear about social issues, listen to Ice Cube while growing up in South Central and you'll understand. The fact is that all of you ""worldly cultivated"" pantsies are too lazy to look further than what the mainstream media or the Top Billboard is feeding you. Of course, you were introduced to MC Solaar by ""Sex in the City"". I rest my case. Nuff said."
1,"Broken case,first cd unplayable.",Cd came in an envelope instead of a box so the case was damaged.Also the first cd was unplayable due to some kind of substance.I tryed to clean it but to no avail.
1,Ridiculous!,"Normally, I love B movies. But this movie was not good. The acting was terrible, the same lines were used over and over again as if the audience were stupid and couldn't tell. The plot could have been used well by actors worth anything, a writer who knew what words are, and a director who knew what he was doing. Of course, my boyfriend loved it. But he loves all gay films. The two leads were not even attractive (not a necessity, just would have made the movie more watchable). I mean, who wants to see ugly dudes rape frat guys? Not me. Don't waste your money. Buy a real movie instead, like SpiceWorld."
1,Obnoxious and Inept,"This story of two gay serial killer-rapists getting revenge on elitist Ivy League jerks is quite possibly the most obnoxious piece of celluloid I have ever endured.I see other reviews comparing it the works of John Waters and H.G. Lewis, but I guess I missed the joke.All I got was an ugly, mean-spirited, ineptly made piece of garbage that seemed to be going out of its way to try to offend me, but instead just left me with a migraine.Patrick - ScreamQueenz Horror Blog"
3,the bodygaurd-one great track for lovers,so i got this CD for 'the bodygaurd'the rest of the CD is professional but commercial so-so.I'm in love right now so collecting songs that hit the spot and this one does.Think was Whitney putting ALL she felt about Bobby into this one.So does roberta flack's 'first time i ever saw your face' and minnie ripperton's 'loving you'so anyway that's why i bought it.
2,"Too bad this has anytjing at all to do with ""The Bodyguard""",It's a pity this alleged masterpiece of an album will be forever linked with a shlocky film that nobody remembers. Soundtracks are a bad idea.
1,horrible,i don't know what was worse the film or the soundtrack? lets get the facts out Whitney can sing but she more often than not favors run of the mill material.Babyface is the most important Writer&Producer over the past decade.but this sappy material is way overblown.
5,"the bodyguard, soundtrack","One of my favorites. I had the original soundtrack on cassette, and played it so much had to replace it with the CD."
4,Classic soundtrack with great music,"It's a classic soundtrack with some great music, including I will Always Love you. Great quality, will miss Whitney Houston dearly."
5,terriffic,I really enjoyed the Body Guard soundtrack album. Whitney Houston has a beautiful voice and this CD has terriffic songs on it.I have enjoyed listening to it on many occasions.
5,As good as brand new!,I couldn't tell any difference between the appearance or sound quality of this cd and others I have bought brand new. Excellent Quality!
1,Poor choice - not much soundtrack,I thought this would be a nice background album to listen to as I enjoyed the movie. It is mostly her singing - not much of the soundtrack. Wish I hadn't bought it - won't ever play it again.
2,A Grammy Travesty,"This album won the ""Album of the Year"" Grammy award. ""ALBUM OF THE YEAR""?! ""ALBUM?"" ""The soundtrack to 'the Bodyguard?'"" Song of the year, sure. Vocal performance of the year, sure. Female singer of the year, sure. But ALBUM?!? I'm sorry, but the soundtrack to some silly exploitation flick in no way deserves such an honor. Whoever decided to give it this award has no concept of the album genre, or how artfully albums can be assembled."
1,Overrated,"This album is overrated if not for the work of the sound studio, there is only one song that stands out and by now we all know what that one is."
5,The Bodyguard Soundtrak,The item was received as descript on the website and my family really enjoy the item. I look forward to doing more business with you.
5,The Best CD ever,Love the movie and listening to the Bodyguard CD makes you re-live this fine movie.Every song on the CD is great. The Best.
4,Bodyguard Triumph,"Surprisingly, when Whitney Houston made the leap from music to movies, nobody ever expected the music to be as powerful and enduring as it remains today. Nevertheless, she proved that music did matter in every single film, and every single soundtrack sale that gets highly overlooked for movies.The 1992 soundtrack to The Bodyguard, consists of half the songs Whitney Houston recorded for the film. The songs are just tough and everlasting as they always remain to be. From her mega-hits I Will Always Love You, to Queen Of The Night, and even I Have Nothing. The soundtrack also has other good, strong gems from others, including Joe Cocker's soulful ballad, Trust In Me, and Kenny G's performance with Aaron Neville on Even If My Heart Would Break.While many soundtracks lay into dust these days, because of the lackluster music they create for the films, the music from The Bodyguard is still a constant into the cross between music and movies."
4,FABULOUS!!!!,"The soundtrack to the hit movie the ""Bodyguard"" is absolutely fabulous! While the songs from Whitney Houston are great-there needs to be more of them! END"
5,WOW,"As a commercial piece of engineered pop, records do not get any better than this Babyface-produced collection of smash hits. You need not have seen the film, which is far inferior to the record, to enjoy the songs included here. Whitney Houston's performances are powerhouse, to say the least, and the fabulously imaginative pairing of her then-stunning lung power with Dolly Parton's wonderful song I Will Always Love You creates an memorable classic pop-yodel of love, loss and emotion. All of the cuts are supremely enjoyable, though, and cross all strata of tastes and styles."
5,10 stars,"S.Khan is obiously tone def if he thinks this is garbage this has to be one of the best, scratch that this is the best soundtract in the world, I recomend this for every one with a CD player, tape player, record player, hell anyone with ears period and ca apreciate good music, obviously S.Khan cant."
5,VERY NICE SOUNDTRACK!!!,Exceptional singing but Whitney already has a nice voice to go with it . These songs are very nice and very well picked so I would truly reccommend anyone who likes whitney to buy this album !!!! Whitney really delivers on this album!!!!!
1,US Mailbox,"This raw aluminum mailbox is made from incredibly thin material with poor detailing. Unlike the picture shown, it actually had an eagle embossed on the door which adds only insult. Not worth purchasing at any price."
3,"Yes, but only if ...","You need to be an Alan Watts fan to fully appreciate this book; it is not the place to start if you are just getting into him, but it is important if you want a fully representative collection of this brilliant man's work.Watts' writings, considered as a whole, come close to providing a workable philosophy of life. This book contains essays, some quite funny, about materialism. But it wouldn't make much sense unless you were already familiar with his more important and serious work explaining and translating Buhddist and Hindu thought and practice into Western terms."
3,Too big,"While the ideal is clever, this belt is much to big for my waist that continuously came undone while doing flip turns. I think it would be better for me to use inside my swimsuit that outside. It is more like a supersized band for a supersized person."
5,Awesome Read and It's All True,"I picked this book in the library. I began reading it that night and could not put it down. It's incredible reading and gives insight into the beginning of the Israel's secret agency. It is an honest look at the Mossad, inspiring awe to eyebrow raising blunders. There is a poignant account of Eli Cohen, one of Israel's most famous spies who almost became Minister of Defense in SYRIA! His story alone could be a Hollywood movie. Great book for almost or atleast 13 and over."
5,Great Product!,My daughter is not getting rashes anymore and her skin is sooooooooooooo soft! It's not the prettiest smelling stuff but it works great. I still wash her hair with pretty smelling stuff and use this for her whole body.
2,Reruns,"This is not a new or original work. It is a combining of previously published Cuppy books under a new title. Only the title is new. This book is small and lightweight, printed for US troops during World War II. The type is small and hard to read. You are better advised to buy the individual books that it contains, unless you are a backpacker looking for lightweight reading.As for the text, anything by Cuppy is worth reading, but buy the original books for easier reading."
5,This set is amazing!!,"This set is amazing!! Gorgeous board, incredible pieces, very unique!! It's looks exactly as advertised. Very happy, would totally recommend it."
4,Good,"As a UFC fan, this event had some good fights. I bought it while I was away from home and t.v so I started collecting all of the UFC's. It became just another DVD to the collection."
1,"Works great for a year, then...","I have a C1500 that I paid $1299 for. I have taken care of my machine religiously - Claris filters, tablet cleanings, RO water, finest beans. It produces great espresso. But, after a little more than a year, it clogged internally, and I had to send it in for repair at a cost of $125. Now, a few months later, it has clogged again, and I'm out an additional $125. The C1300 internals are essentially the same as my C1500, so I expect that it will have the same problems. Capresso says it's my fault - I'm using too fine a grind (on the internal grinder). Maybe so - but the manual never said the machine would clog if you use a fine grind - the coffee flow was strong on this grind setting - and why put a setting on the machine that will break it in normal use? Caveat Emptor."
5,A forgotten bel canto treasure,"""Maria de Rudenz"" may have a rather unsavory and highly improbable plot, but the masterly music of Donizetti helps put the work over. All the singers are first rate, with special mention going to Bruce Ford, one of the finest tenors working in this repertoire, and Nelly Miriciou, who sings the title role with complete conviction reminiscent of Callas, without her predecessor's unsteadiness. This may not be a lost masterpiece, but it is a highly enjoyable addition to the recorded Donizetti canon. As always, Opera Rara's presentation puts all other complete opera sets to shame, with its deluxe packaging and first-rate booklet and notes, detailing the history of the opera. Fantastic."
4,Brutus in the Eye of Hell's Storm,"Excellent Sc-Fi/Fantasy reading in a setting that allows for unexpected characters and story twists. I really felt that the series was rolling along with great momentum with this volume of the Heroes in Hell Series (aka ""the Damned Saga""). Julius Caesar's Legion's and household (Kleopatra, Dante, Machiavelli to name a few) try to survive while Brutus is trying to work out his place in Caesar's household (and heart). It seems every power structure in Hell (Roman, Egyptian, Infernal...) is trying to use Brutus against Caesar. With plenty of intrigue, and combat, the book is a very fun read."
1,Great Premise; LOUSY book,"I TRIED and eventually did get through this awful book. The characters took forever to develop; the writing was overly formulaic; leaden and completely derivative. The writing could barely keep my attention as I plodded through the text. It qualifies as one of the worst, if not THE worst, book I ever read. The one star is only because the premise was excellent and could have gone so many places, but just failed to get off the ground. Someone told me that female fantasy authors use their initials to disguise their gender, since many people sterotype female authors at being no good at fantasy. Well, I had no idea what the author's sex was until two minutes before writing this review, and the book still sucked - no excuses. Save your money."
1,Didn't Work,"Despite the vendor claim, the Wireless function does not work with my Dell Axim Pocket PC. Installed the driver, but the Windows Mobile OS wouldn't give me the ability to properly set up the wireless function."
2,"Not the greatest, not the worst","Well, this one's installation was a little tricky, but once I got it installed, it worked wonderfully... about 40% of the time. It had a nasty habit of disconnecting me randomly from the network I was attempting to use (when I know the signal strength was too high for lost connections), and the card would become unreasonably hot after only perhaps an hour of use. When it worked, it worked flawlessly. When it didn't... well... it didn't."
2,Must be made in China,"It works..... but not on a Belkin Pre-N router. It will connect, with all security turned off, but will only get a 169.254.xxx.xxx ip address. The Router will even show it's connected.. it just cannot access anything.The card does connect to other routers.But here's what's funny. The MAC address labeled on the card doesn't match the actual MAC address of the card! I had to find this out by disabling MAC filtering, and see that it connects to the router, then writing down the correct MAC address. Nice quality control..... The seller Scotts Stuff Inc was very nice, I didn't have a problem with them...... just this card is garbo. I'd recommend an AmbiCom G card instead. It connects to pretty much anything, even my Belkin Pre-N router with crazy range."
4,Fun to watch,"I will admit to being an anime fan, it was nice to find a series that both myself and my young niece and nephew could all enjoy. I am saddened however that there will not likely be a second season."
4,Good quality,"Fabric, but don't mistake 'finished edges' for 'hemmed edges'. This isn't a big deal to me, because an edge that is finished with a simple surged stitch lays flatter, and that works for me. The rolling pin cover is a simple, knitted, sock-style, slip-on. While not necessarily a high end set, it is quite servicable set, and good quality got the price."
3,Left me a bit uneasy,"I have to admit, I did enjoy both the movie and the book both a great deal, as a sort of escapist fantasy. Despite the tragedies, it seems like fantasy because it is, in fact, a wealthy and aristocratic person's reality. (Who does one purchase an African ranch from and what was it before it was a ranch, anyhow?) I am most uneasy when the author describes how wonderfully accepted she is by the native people and how much good she has done for them, when it seems like the primary role they had in her life was as her servants."
2,not bad,"I was curious to see if others would pick up on the total lack of Africans in this book about Africa. From the reviews, it looks like many did.That was my first reaction. All the Africans she deals with are servants. When she describes visiting some new place, she lists a few Europeans that she visits. !I wasn't particularly turned off by her privileged life, and that she could afford a ranch the size of San Francisco, like another reviewer said.The other thing that really annoyed me was how she thought African children were getting corrupted by modern ways or something like that. Like other kids, African children should of course learn to appreciate the natural beauty of their country, and so on, but should also be studying math and science, and improving their living conditions.On the whole, this is very much a woman's book. Don't know how else to put it."
2,"Skip the book, see the movie; there's more of Africa in it","If you want a book about a privileged woman who has suffered Kennedyesque family tragedies (mostly brought on by exotic, expensive, reckless pastimes), who tells her story with a lot of nonsense about premonition and reincarnation, and by-the-way, lives on an huge estate-cum-private wildlife preserve in Kenya, then here it is.For the most part it seems the people who love this book are people whose experience of Africa is limited to movies or maybe a four-star safari lodge in a Kenyan game park. People who have spent some time in Africa with Africans or have studied Africa seriously are more reserved in their praise. Nothing about Africa in this book is incorrect (as far as I can tell), there's just not much of it."
5,"The most inspiring book, I have ever read.","This book is a fresh breath of air. Before I read this book, I did not know who to look up to or who to model my life after. Kuki shows that life is a beautiful exsperience and to take each day as it comes. She shows us to follow our hearts. Kuki is a increditable woman. She is so strong, loving, thoughtful and has kept going after terrible odds. She shows how beautiful Africa is. I carry this book with me always as inspiration when things get tough. Her descriptions of her life and Africa are so good you feel as if you there and you want to reach out and thank her for the exsperience."
4,Vanishing Africa,"An evocation of East Africa--the wildlife, the landscape, the tribal people. Reminiscent of Out of Africa and West with the Night. Like them, it's about a European woman living a dangerous and thrilling life in the African bush. It's a woman's story of great love and loss, sensitively written. Possibly too sensitive for some."
1,Disappointing and absurd,"I never ever laid down a book without finishing it before, but this time was the first time! I am a fan of Kenya and I have read almost all literature available on this subject. But Kuki Gallmann's book was a bore. She set off writing about her life at home, then the start of her life in Kenya. She writes about her love for this country and how beautiful she thinks it is. But she is unable to share the beauty with the reader, there are just empty words without compassion. And the book gets even worse, when she writes about her husband's soul that enters her unborn baby's body after his car accident. For me, that was a little too fantastic. And that was about it. I put it down and haven't picked it up since. And I am not planning to, either! It was just too bad!"
4,Good goat milk,"It taste very good,healthy, rich and delicious but the price show a little bit expense compare with the other website."
5,Powdered Goat Milk is wonderful!,"My Son has a milk allergy and it is so hard to bake with Soy milk. Goat milk is expensive and I bought this by mistake when I was buying condensed milk. It's easy to make (I mix it with my emulsion blender) and it is wonderful to cook with. It's sweeter than condensed or whole goat milk for some reason. The price is certainly right! I love how you can make a lot or a little depending on your needs.Meyenberg Powdered Goat Milk, 4-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)"
2,Affordable goat milk!,"I love to feed my kids with goat milk. But to buy it fresh from the farm is so expensive, so this is a great substitute. I started my kids on this when I stopped nursing and they've loved it ever since. They eat it in their cereal and drink it straight from the cup. I think goat's milk is the next best thing to breast milk!"
1,Item doesn't work in my DVD player,Item doesn't work in the USA. I wish it would have been more clear in the description before I bought the DVD.
3,Satisfied.,"This isn't the best book in the series, but it is an interesting story none the less. I enjoy the Wake saga and the heroine, Navee."
5,Dangerous Child,This show is great. I love Ryan Merriman in this movie. Hes almost like me in this movie. I really wanna see it again. Ryan is soooooo hot in this movie. But I would never abuse my mom or my dad.
5,Dangerous Child review,"Excellent story line! The mother made you feel the pain of a mother with a child that's ""different"" and the child showed magnificent acting ability in his portrayal of a emotionally disturbed young person. Acting realistic! Very good!"
3,Delta Is my Hero,"I love Delta Burke and she is one of my favorite actresses. She is the ONLY reason I picked up this old Lifetime TV movie. It was exactly like I figure it would be, cheesy, melodramatic and campy. It is awesome."
2,"Smooth,sweet ,tugs at your heart! What a voice!!",Steve makes me feel like he knows how I feel. His voice is comforting and strong at the same time. I enjoy listening and humming along ... and singing out loud with him as I drive life's highway with him.
4,Still One Of Steve's Best ....,"A poor man's Vince Gill?? Who would say such a thing? Steve & Vince are BOTH talented musicians. One not being any ""better"" than the other. I was lucky to meet Steve when ""I Am Ready"" came out. I knew one or two songs before but became a big fan when this recording came out. Every song on this CD paints & tells a story. Usually you will get a couple of good songs off a CD but every song on here could have been a hit on the radio. Something you don't see much in music anymore."
3,You Have Been Loved review,"George Michael's ""You Have Been Loved"" is a moving and poetic song from Michael's album ""Older."" Michael's lyrics come straight from the heart and deliver an amazingly emotional impact. Fans of the singer will cherish this single in their collection."
1,Don't believe what everybody says...,"The problem I had with this set is that you are led to believe that this workout is one that will put you in shape! However, one must already be in shape to keep up with this one; it is very tough. In addition, Blanks and the others do a very poor job of explaining the moves. I found myself always several steps behind. Definitely disappointing."
5,Book Purchase,"Book came on time and in great cond. YES, I would purchase from this Vendor again, for certain. My review stands as I've written it no more no less, accept this and let me move on. Thank You."
3,Less than it could have been,"Glen Yeadon, author of Nazi Hydra in America, had this to say about The Transfer Agreement:I found it very boring--it was steeped with internal Jewish politics and very little about the actual negotiations with the Nazis or the actual deal and its results. It is geared to Jewish historians and only vaguely to the war and the Nazis... I liked IBM and the War against the Weak - both were good and I bought this one on the strength of the other two. It tried to remain neutral rather than to place the blame on the Zionists. For example, there was no mention of the Zionist who helped load the trains in Hungary to Auschwitz, who was hanged in Israel in the 50s. That type of material was neatly sanitized by omission."
1,Is this book intended as a joke?,"I've had cancer (and recurrances) for 7 years, and I've read every book on every aspect of the subject, and this book is the absolute worst I've yet to come across. LeShan writes a weird mixture of vintage voodoo and goofy ""new-age"" hype. LeShan's lethal psychobabble can be literally deadly as he lures frightened, newly-diagnosed cancer patients into drinking oceans of green tea while while scaring them away from conventional, proven treatment. Avoid this book, and the others like it, unless you want a good laugh."
4,Joshua Eyre Hannum was a prolific collector of genealo,Joshua Eyre HANNUM was a prolific gatherer and collector of family genealogies. All of his manuscripts I know of were handwritten and mostly contained family information gleaned from previously printed information. This handwritten manuscript also contains some form pedigrees. He cites his sources. There is an Index available at the LDS family history center in SLC.
4,He-Man & She-Ra,I loved these cartoons when I was a kid & STILL love them now. I bought He-Man 10 Best Episodes On DVD which was awesome & I totally loved them so cant wait for the release of the seasons.I must admit though SHE-RA PRINCESS OF POWER was my Favourite out of the two so PLEASE BRING SHE-RA TO DVD.
3,scratched disks,I ordered the Heman Vol.1 DVD series new. When i opened the packaged two of the disks were loose. Two episodes on two disks skip. This was a gift and the exchange policy is a hassel. I would not order DVD's from Amazon again.
2,"Great set, but bad packaging","The content is fantastic, but watch out! This comes in the same digipak case as most of Fox tv series. I opened a brand new pack, and four out of six discs are so horribly scratched that I'm sending it back. This occurs during shipping, and I'm guessing the back of the discs are rubbing against case. It would seem the manufacturers would correct this problem and save consumers a lot of hassle!"
5,Finally!!!,This collection was put together very well. Remastered and everything. High-def is something to see!!! I plan on buying the rest of the set as it is released.
5,He's back!,"This DVD set is a real treat for He-man fans. I've been waiting a long time to watch my favorite cartoon of the 80's and this set does not disappoint.It looks surprisingly sharp and bright for a 20 year old cartoon. The story lines are corny but hey its still really fun, and keeps me smiling.If you have never seen He-Man before I'm not sure you'll appreciate it and may think it's stupid but for the fans that did it is a must have! BUY IT!"
5,Great cartoon but some of the discs are scratched...,"I thought I was the only one with scratched discs. I see others having the same problem as me. Beware, some discs come out of the box with scratches on them and they freeze at certain points of the episode. Very Frustrating! Luckily I can copy the damaged discs using dvd-x-copy software and it plays like new. Other than that, awesome quality and extras."
1,Opinionated Propaganda!,"This book promulgates disinformation about the ""separation of church and state"". On page 340, this ideology is defined as ""required by the first Amendment to the United States Constitution"". This idea of ""separation"" was a quote from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson regarding a single denomination and is taken out of context when applied to school issues of prayer, etc. Nowhere does the constitution refer to any such mandate. What is more disgraceful, the co-author, Joseph F. Kent is a professor of History. come on, professor, do your homework - try reading the constitution for once."
4,Barry shows his STUFF,"If you are a true Manilow fan, you have to own this set. I was put off by the price at first, but I was given this set last year from my sister. There are tracks I have never heard here, different versions of tracks I knew and of course the video. That makes it special for those who have been unable to see him in concert. The showtunes were great. I had never heard those and really enjoyed them. I am grateful that he put this out so that I could have the experience of having the fun compilation of his great talent."
5,Barry Manilow complet collection,"I Love the kind of song he put on the CD I listen to them over and over they make you feel good about your self and the one you ""Love"""
5,blue-eyed soul?,"In my opinion, Barry Manilow should at least be considered to be inducted in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame sometime in the near future. As an African-American, such as myself, I think he's got soul and sounds just as good as some of the black male singers we're used to hearing on the radio.Manilow, should at least considered ""Blue-eyed Soul"""
2,Disappointed,"I bought this hoping for the music I remember. Instead, I got ""Oops"" when he's singing Mandy; lackluster ""live"" performances and otherwise disappointing performances of his greatest hits. I'm still a devoted fan. Just disappointed with this purchase of this album."
1,A Joke,I Write The Songs? It is difficult to take somebody seriously when he claims to have invented music!
5,Love this soap,I love using goat's milk soap. I love this soap. Doesn't have a scent like the orginal scent goat's milk soap.
2,no...not so good,"I think it muse be the glycerin in this product but this soap was horrible! My skin was drier than ever after using it, and left a white chalkiness behind. I wanted to try something different and natural for my winter skin, but I think I'll pass on this one in the future."
4,Very good CD,A great CD for autumn. These guys remind me a bit of Type-O-Negative with their vocal and guitar tones. The songs are dark and atmospheric. Highly recommended.
1,Nearly unreadable,What the hell do they want to tell me!?Maybe this would have become a better book if it had been written in romanian first and had been translated to english afterwards. The intention of the authors never becomes clear in this book. Of course there some isolated nice ideas concerning the topic but this is definitely not a readable book for those who are not experts of noncommutative probability. And those who are experts do not need this book.
4,HAYNES REPAIR MANUAL for FORD WINDSTAR NUMBER 36097,Manual was in excellent condition. Written well with good diagrams
2,This book should have been under 200 pages ..,There is useful information in this book but itcould have been said in about 1/10 of the space.Concept are repeated ad nauseum. And author usesancient GUI styles for examples instead of currentones. Extremely painful to read.
4,telephone book of textual above averageness,"User Interface Design is a very complicated subject. This colossal book mimics closely a telephone book with a large amount of text-heaviness. If you get over the fact that there are a wall of words on most pages, the book actually has some great content and ideas. It generally talks about user interfaces, as opposed to web interface/design. It talks more about the distinction between them and what their purposes are. It talks about different controls and the best solution for a problem that a client has. You find out a lot of things that are like, ""Wow, I never thought about that, but that makes so much sense"".I am mostly a web designer, but knowing the purpose of GUIs is a great skill since there is going to be a boom in RIAs(Rich Internet Applications) in the coming years. It probably could have been condensed quite a bit, but there is a lot more good than bad, so I give it four stars."
5,awesome,This is the best game ever! I recommend this game for everyone. This game gave me so much enjoyment and joy.
1,poor quality,3 of 5 phones are not working properly. Works with system fine but phones have to be reset frequently. Not a great phone in my opinion
1,"Product good,,Service less than desirable!!","Well, the product is good in flavor and fairly good at mixing into milk and water. The downfall of this product is the customer service behind it.I contacted the company regarding a problem I had with the product and rather than handle my issue in a professional manner, it became an immediate argument. The accusatory manner, unprofessional demeanor and over all juvenile response to my valid concerns as a customer put a very bad taste in my mouth. There are so many products on the market that are as good if not much better without paying the price of extremely poor service."
3,Great for Price,Didn't mix well with milk/water unless used blender. Actually worked very well mixing with yogurt. Would buy again.
2,Not a good book for high school student,"High-School is not like how Robert Cormier depicts it in his book the Chocolate War. Many people belive that it is a perfect example of how cliquish people can be in highschools. Well let me tell you something, highschool is not anything like that. Highschool does not consist of groups like the Vigils, and in no way does it exist of all students against one over one stupid sale of chocolates. Students are to diverse and they have opinions of their own. Robert Cormier, makes it seem like high school is disrupted entirely by one small student, while all the rest go with the flow. Well, reality check Mr. Cormier maybe you should spend a week in a high school to see how wrong you really were."
1,This book was confusing,I have to read this book in my English I class. This book was so confusing! I had to read it about four or five times before I understood the book. I have read better books. The resaon I read the book was becasue I had to. This book was a one time only book.
1,This book is not for everyone.,"When I read this book, my teacher told me that I would love it. ""Trust me,"" she said, ""it is one of the best novels I have ever read."" Because of this glowing recommendation, I took the book home and read it. However, the brutality, cruelty, and antagonistic atmosphere in which the book takes place horrified me. I was repulsed by the violence portrayed so graphically in the novel. Yes, I can see that it is extremely well-written. However, I found the book horrifically gruesome and depressing. By the time I finished the book, I was in tears. This is not the world of high school that I know. This is a perverted, harsh world of destruction and violence that left me in shock."
1,"Maybe I'm a ""Wimp""","Yes, it's ""great"" that poor Jerry Renault ""disturbs his universe"" and ""stands up"" to the horrible Vigils and Archie. But, it is so disturbing how those manipulative, callous, power abusing characters create such havoc and destroy the other sensitive young intelligent caring students that they do; I think especially for young adult readers that it could be overwhelming. Maybe I'm a wimp, but with all the concern with school ""bullying"" now and sensitivity training in schools. . .this is everything we're trying to fight against and change."
1,An 8th Grader who is actually has a real view of school,"Robert Corimer's has a very disillusioned view of high school. This novel portrays teen-hood as a time where violence and vulgarity are more acceptible than refusing to be on the ""in-crowd"". He fails to include that not all high school students are willing to be sucked into a state of moral rejection and that the one's who do seem to want to do the right thing are left hurting and without inspiring their peers."
1,If I could I would give it a zero,"I found this book extremely depressing, and I don't think that anybody but a sick, morbid, depressed person would find it a good book. You can read it if you want, but I bet you'll find it as good as I did. (It's quite possibly the worst book I've ever read, and I've read a lot of bad books.)"
4,Masterfully Structured and Unique,The Chocolate war is a simple book about a secret society within a trinity school. Cormier uses excelent wording throughtout the book. It discusses the cruel intensity of secret societys within private schools. The main charecter Jerrys mother recently passed away and has to go through a lot in order to keep himself in one piece.
2,"Very, Very unrealistic","This book was very unrealistic. I don't know where Robert Cormier went to high school, but it simply isn't the way he made it seem. This is a typical book where an adult writer tries to ""understand"" or portray teenage life. I think Robert Cormier failed to do this. However, the book did have a few good parts that made you think. I have read other books by the same author and they are well written but this one just wasn't the same."
2,too confusing,"I thought that the characters in the book were somewhat realistic to teens today, but he did leave out some other things that boys go through as they grow up. The storyline was horrible, it was TOO CONFUSING, it skipped around a lot between characters, and it went heavy into detail leaving out the plot(if there even is one). I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,This is one of my favorite books.,"Pretty much everything I said in my review of ""The Chocolate War"" applies here, but in addition I would like to add that I found this book extremely appealing on a very basic level. Archie Costello is the person every one of us wants to be: charismatic, powerful, and always in control. We all secretely want to be master manipulators, to be able to escape the consequences of our own actions. It isn't an appealing truth, but it's there, and this book makes you face it."
2,Not For the young and innocent,I believe that this book uses too much bad language and it sends a bad message to young readers. This book to me promotes violence and getting authority through violence. It gives the message that if you don't go along with the crowd that you are doing the wrong thing. I believe that anyone who reads this book could be mislead to do something that they wouldn't normally do. The way that this book is written and the language that it uses would turn a lot of people away even if they agree with the message that this book puts across.I don't believe that this book should be available to young readers and anyone who is easily offended by the use of explicit language.
3,Not suitable for children under 14,"The Chocolate War, by Robert Cormier, was supposedly written for high school students, and is not appropriate for middle school students. The sexual tones and the main character's thoughts and discussions on masturbation are not appropriate for kids in middle school. Although this book has a great plot, and is a good read for young adults, I would not recommend it for kids in middle school, especially girls. The main character Jerry Renault is a freshman at a Catholic high school,and repeatedly refers to girls' breasts and is very descriptive of female parts, which is something that middle school kids do not need to be copying."
3,Great book--conservative readers beware!,"I enjoyed the issues presented in this book, but wanted to warn conservative readers about the language and sexuality it contains."
3,The Chocolate War,"The Chocolate War, the novel by Robert Cormier, is a well-written and interesting tale, but the story of Jerry Renault, Trinity High School, the students who attended it, and the administration, had a very dark and negative atmosphere through out the whole book. The Chocolate War is a story about an outsider (Jerry Renault) in high school that didn't cause much excitement, until his refusal to sell chocolates. This book is over-come with greed and cruelty towards each student, but also the administration. The Chocolate War has many elements... This was a well thought-out book, but I thought that the story dragged on and was boring. This book makes you think more, but it's very odd and sometimes doesn't make that much sense. I would say that if you want to broaden your reading selection and read a more demanding book, read The Chocolate War."
3,Very disturbing book,"There have been numerous reviews on this book but I only found it recently and having read it I must say it was a very disturbing and hopeless story. The issues seem to be that teenagers should conform or they will suffer, and the religious teachers are portrayed as being really a disgrace to the teaching profession. On another level it is well written and the fast pace keeps you turning the pages, but there is no light or humour to soften this tale."
4,Realistic view into teenaged boys,"At first I thought this book was banned because of multiple masturbation references, and it probably was, but possibly also the extreme cruelty with which the characters treat each other. The whole thing is very dark and disturbing. It wasn't pleasant to read, but really elucidates the frequent depravity of human nature.I expect children to be cruel, but the teachers' participation in these undertakings was truly sickening. However, the clearness and conciseness of the writing and emotional depth of the characters was brilliant."
3,half and half thoughts for the Chocolate War,"I have mixed feelings about the novel, The Chocolate War, by Robert Cormier. I disliked the beginning of the book because there is too much unnecessary description about the characters sexual thought's. For example, there are too many instances when Archie the head of The Vigils, a gang, tries to blackmail Emile, a trouble maker, with embarrassing pictures. The middle is helpful but it is too repetitive about the chocolate sale. The information about the characters helped me understand the plot of the beginning of the book. I learned that Archie is the head honcho of the school and bosses around all of the kids. A part in the book that is repetitive is when Brother Leon, one of the teachers, repeatedly asks the kids to sell chocolates and they all say ""I will"". I liked the ending of the book because it is different from most endings and not what I expected. I advise you to read this book if you like surprises."
4,A powerful and disturbing book...,"Before recommending this book to my adolescent child, I recently re-read it. I had forgotten how disturbing and too close to reality this story was. I think most teenagers can handle the story; however, I think they should have someone with whom they can discuss the troubling outcome."
4,"Weak ending, but overall pretty great","Just got finished reading this book. It’s an unflinching, dark tale about a high school freshman named Jerry Renault, who decides to buck the trend by refusing to participate in the annual chocolate sale, at first as part of a prank, then, as an act of rebellion, incurring the wrath of not only of Brother Leon, the headmaster regent, but also of the vigils, which is a school sanctioned secret society.The book’s a little on the short side (only about 250 pages long) and the ending was somewhat abrupt, but it’s overall a good read, with a depressing, but true message about conformity."
1,this book is a disgrace to novels everywhere,"I, a sixth grader from a good suburban school, shudder at the fact that people actually rated this a ten. The ending and the whole entire book was a let down the entire way. The climax was %*&@# and the resolution was that also."
1,The Chocolate War,"The chocolate warThe chocolate war was one of the best books I have ever read...NOT! The chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene. The boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused, but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot. I would not recommend this book because it seemed inappropriate. I don't think that this book should be available to children at a middle school level. This story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out. I think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of Archie. Archie is a suspicious character that knows every one. I wish this book was more school appropriate, but it isn't and was a horrid book. Therefore, this book would be great if the author published a book with the Sam story but more school appropriate situations and words."
4,Great but a little confusing,I really enjoyed this but at times it got very confusing. It was hard to put down. I am looking forward to reading Beyond the Chocolate war
4,The Chocolate War Is a Thriller,"The Chocolate War is a great novel because of the suspense, action, and unpredictability. The novel has action on every page. Whether it is Archie Costello, the assigner of the group called The Vigils, intimidating a student to do something wrong, or two students fighting, the book is always action-packed. The Vigils have more power and influence on the school than the brothers who run the school. Archie Costello, the unofficial Vigil leader who has been the assigner for three years, gives out assignments like unscrewing all the screws in a classroom. The book is suspenseful when Jerry is trying to decide whether or not to sell the chocolates, which is a school tradition. The book is unpredictable because the ending is not what a reader usually expects out of an ending of a novel. The suspense, action, and unpredictability will keep you reading. You will never want to put this great book down."
3,Violent But You learn a lot about life,"The Chocolate War was cruel, violent, but that is how life is today. Being a teenager, I don't want to read about books with fairy-tale endings, to me it is really boring. So this book was an awakening from those other what seemed 10 million books. You learn about a child's life and the pressures that comes with it. Even though I don't really know why this novel was approved to be read, I'm glad that it was. The world is a place that when it's disturbed, you wish that you never said or did what you did. Jerry did this and stood up for himself, and what he believed, even if it was just selling choclates."
3,My opinion on The Chocolate War,"The Chocolate War was a very interesting book in most parts. The book describes things that some people might find offensive because of the way they describe the boys' feelings about the chocolate sale and other subjects. This book lets reader think about what Jerry's life was like and what he went through, e.g.: his mother died, his father wasn't close to him, he went to a strict private school. All of these things, we are not used to and just don't think about until shown to us. This book is a good book to read if you are mature enough, because if you were young and immature this book would only amuse you in certain parts. But if you were older and more mature you would understand the book more personally and relate it to your own life."
2,Suspense led to disappointment,"The Chocolate War, was descent. The plot made you want to keep reading, I couldn't stop turning pages, but, I was disappointed with the end. It just cut off leaving me to wonder WHAT ELSE! One thing I strongly felt was the The Chocolate War had a lot of unnecessary detail with discusting parts and just unneeded info as if Cormier didn't have anything else to write. This made it boring. Being that I'm a female, I did not enjoying reading about a bunch of teenage boys going through puberty and making immature actions. I think this book should be read by older audiences because of the appropiateness with language and sexuality, plus, the concept does not have much of a point and an older audience might intepret it better. This is what I think of The Chocolate War."
3,TCW Review,The Chocolate war is a book that is pretty dull but brings up controversial matters with gangs and schools. this makes the story interesting. it also makes young readers realize some of the truths that relate to the story and schools in general. the Chocolate War would defiantly be a good book to read.
4,Powerful Book,"This is a good book with a powerful message. It starts with a high school freshman Jerry Renault being picked on by a secret school society called the Vigils. Brother Leon, a teacher at the school assists them in the harassment when Jerry refuses to participate in an annual school chocolate sale.As stupid as it may seem, the Vigils see him as a threat to them and the school tradition. I'll just tell you that they do some nasty things to him and those who admire him for his defiance (I don't want to ruin the book for those of you who haven't read it). All in all, it shows you that standing up for what you believe in and doing what you want to do is not always the best choice. Jerry didn't go along with the rest of the crowd and suffered the negative consequences for his choices. It's a good, suspensful, and exciting read, and for those of you who haven't read it, you should."
2,Archie Story,Archie is a bully at Trinity high school.He is in a click called the vigils. He is sort of like the leader. He expects everything to come out his way.He likes to blackmail and threaten others so that way the other kids could do his work. In his click he asigns the assignment.He asign other kids to sell chocolates for him instead of him doing it him self. Because of his bullying other kids fear him. The most feared kid is a boy name Obie. Archie pushes him around alot. The only kid that does not allow Archie to push him around is Jerry. Jerry refuses to let Archies push him around. He stands up for him self. He does not go down like a caword.Archie realized that Jerry will not help him with the chocolate assignment so he leaves him alone!
1,What rubbish!,"Beyond being grim and depressing, this book is dated and unrealistic. The number of reviewers that over-rate this book giving it 5 stars is alarming. They are out of touch with teenage boys completely if they think it is realistic and representative. It wasn't in the early 1970s and it isn't now. I would not recommend it to anyone - - there are too many truly good books out there to spend a moment reading this tripe."
1,I did not like this book at all!,"I thought that this book was not so interesting. The author went off into to many different directions, and never stayed with the same situation. Also, the book didn't really get interesting until the end. The end of the book was really messed up, it didn't really make sense. Also, I thought that the story didn't seam to have a lot of thought put into it, thats why it was so boring!"
5,An Amazing book,"This book speaks to any age and all experience. It's the perfect telling of a person becoming an unwitting hero not through action but inaction and understanding, at least, who he does not want to become."
4,"A realist novel, which teaches the truth","Rarely does a novel describe the realities and hardships of a teenagers life. The book is misunderstood by most, and considered unhealthy for adolescents. The truth is, reality is not about goodies beating baddies, it is about coping throughout hardship."
4,Odd But Good,"I like this book, despite the fact that is outdated (but aren't all classics??? i.e. treasure island, last of the mohecans, maniac magee, the light in the forest) has an odd way of writing ( I like that) and has some term you wouldn't normally want. I recommend it for people who think different."
5,This book is one of the most important I have ever read,"When i was younger I did not understand this book. It has stayed with me as I grew and has become one of my favorites. Everyone could learn some hard lessons from this. One of the only realistic books aimed at young, modern, readers I have experienced. painfully honest and rare in it's viewsl. On par with ""Catcher In the Rye"" in my mind."
4,Do I dare disturb the universe????,"The Chocolate War was an exciting book with several surprises, characters and conflicts. The book starts off with Jerry Renault (the main character) trying out for Trinity's football team as a freshman. As I read the first chapter of The Chocolate War I got a sense of how unusual Trinity seemed. The football coach alone was very cruel to Jerry by spitting on him followed by insults of his strength. In this story there are several conflicts. The biggest conflict was between Jerry and the school because of Jerry's assignment by the vigils not to sell his quota of chocolates for two weeks for the school fundraiser. The conflict becomes even bigger when Jerry continues not to sell the chocolates after his assignment was over. The vigils decided that Jerry was defying them and that wouldn't get away with it. Throughout the story Jerry thought only one reoccurring question: ""Do I dare disturb the universe?"""
4,The Chocolate War,"This book was a great book, written very well. Cormier described the feelings of Jerry, Archie, Obie, Goober, Leon, and all of the boys greatly: each boy had an individual and unique personality. This was a book with deep thoughts, yet the ending leaves you hanging. I think Cormier did a great job creating the Vigils and the assignments and the great cookie sale. I think he used a great use of descriptions and adjectives. Jerry was a strong character, Archie was a cruel villian. This was an excellent book. I do, though, recommend this book mainly to boys of the ages 14-16."
5,The Chocalate War is a Great Coming of Age Novel,"Robert Cormier has written a story which is so true in all of today's schools. Bullying should be a crime because it affects so many lives of young adults. This read is a total gem and I recommend it for everyone. Thank you Robert Cormier for mirorring today's occurrences at schools and what happens at them. As a writer with my debut novel coming out September 13th, 2011 and available on Amazon.com, three cheers to Robert Cormier for an unforgettable and timeless effort."
3,The Chocolate War,"The Chocolate War was a very discriptive book. I did enjoy the book though I was a little surprised at some of the content. It was very true to life. Robert Cormier did a great job of describing the conflicting lives of teenagers. Me and a few classmates read this book in class and we all enjoyed the book. The fabulous way the author changes between the many characters and voices the thoughts of them all keeps you reading. This book is so descriptive and deep that you can feel the emotions of the characters. The hate or pain that runs through you when Jerry gets attacked, or the slyness that Archie feels when he thinks up a succesful assignment and escapes the black box. Those kinds of things are what make this book stand out from others. Overall I only gave this book three stars, but it is a good book and I think that all young adults should read it."
1,"Poorly written, underdeveloped characters and plot","Granted, this was required reading for my freshman year of high school, but let it be known that I loved the other book we had to read - Great Expectations. Also granted is that no modern author is going to live up to the late, great Dickens, but why is this book considered a modern classic? It is terrible and boring from the very first page, full of dull and unlikeable characters, some who are written about in detail for a whole chapter and then never mentioned anywhere else in the book. What was Cormier thinking? It's never really clear exactly why Jerry continues to refuse to sell chocolates, even after the Vigils release him from that obligation. Did Jerry disturb the universe? No. He disturbed his school, but why is also never made clear. If you're looking for a good, modern novel with a tortured boy for a hero, read the far more clever ""The Giver,"" and don't waste your time on this bland novel, which isn't worth the paper it's printed on."
3,A Whole Different Book,This book is not what I expected.It had many problems.First off the first book;s main character is barely recognized in this one.Plus its almost completely different from the first one.Even though its filled with more action than the last one i would not recommend this book to many people.
5,Good,"Overall, I enjoyed reading this book. I read it in middle school and I enjoyed it so much that I bought the sequel."
4,Group dynamics,"A 1001 CBYMRBYGU.Jerry Renault is a freshman at a private Catholic high school. It is chocolate time, the time in which the students are asked to sell chocolates to raise money for the school. This year, students are asked to sell more chocolate than ever and the cost of each bar is twice as much.At Jerry's school, there is a secret group of boys who enjoy the pain of others called The Vigils. The Vigils ask Jerry to refuse to take part in the chocolate sale for ten days. Jerry complies. On the eleventh day, when Jerry is supposed to fall in line again, he suddenly decides to continue to refuse to take part in the sale.The group dynamics in this book are fascinating. I'd love to hear what high school students would think about this book."
4,A Great Sequel to a Great Book,"Beyond the Chocolate War continues the story of Jerry Renault, Roland Goober, Obie, Archie and the Vigils. Cormier's slightly gritty and truthful writing is a welcome change from the perfect worlds in many Young Adult books. He tells it like it is; the pressure of secret peer society, the need to belong in the world and the ever-tumultuous teen relationship. The sequel is definitely as good as its prequel, though I preferred the latter, and the addition of new and exciting characters such as Ray Bannister and Laurie Gundarson and a deeper probe into Jerry's injuries make this book suspenseful and disturbing as it looks closely into the face of evil. The plot twists and turns, with Cormier's mastery of the teenage fiction novel evident. Since this book was an easy read, exciting and full of adventure, I would definitely recommend it to teens and adults who enjoy suspenseful books."
1,An atrocious waste of paper.,"CHOCOLATE WAR should, in my humble opinion, be heaved off a cliff for good. There's no wit, no heroes, no triumphs. It's black comedy with no laughs.I fail to see how anybody could enjoy it, and even put it on a class reading curriculum like my school did."
2,Perversions pointless and un-needed,"The Book The Chocolate War, by Robert Cormier I found rather disturbing. There were many incidents throughout the course of the book that were irrelevant and just down-right discusting. The author made many refernces to women in a derogotory sense, which made me as a female feel degraded and uncomfortable. On more than one occasion Robert Cormier irrelevantly included more than one of the students pleasuring themselves whether it was at home or in school. These actions do not belong in a book that is read in school. It teaches to do wrong and think like a perverted man."
2,Great performance of caricatured story,"Frank Muller did a great job performing this audiobook. Unfortunately, the story is filled with stereotyped caricatures. Most of the characters appear nothing more than one-dimensional, with the attempts to 'broaden' them oten falling flat. The end also seems somewhat forced on the story."
3,Could have been worse,"This book was not nearly as good as the previous one, Beyond the Chocolate War. I kept reading it, hoping it would get better, thinking it had to get better, but it never did. It seems like Cormier is trying to say that in the end the evil side is going to win anyway, so there's no point in even trying to beat them. I felt so confused and wondered what happened to people when the book ended. I needed a whole lot more closure. Were Jerry and Goober still friends or did they just ditch each other? Was Archie really evil or was there something else behind his plots? I'm just confused and disappointed in the novel. If you liked the first one, don't ruin it by reading this one."
3,missing the point,"Most negative reviews of this book focus on the language and references to masturbation. I found much more disturbing the fact that the girls in this book (for the only 'woman' that exists in the world of this novel is a dead mother of one of the main characters)are portrayed solely as objects for adolescent boys' fantasies - reinforcing a madonna/whore view of women. Additionally, despite the fact that the author is Catholic and has set this in a Catholic boys' school and telegraphed in the opening and closing chapters that the boy who is brutalized is a Christ figure, that symbolism is not discussed. At least one review has depicted the book as one that promotes collective social action as the only solution to combatting evil, as one individual cannot. Yet I find it hard to believe that this book can be adequately understood apart from a Christian theological worldview."
5,RAW,A brilliant work of fiction. The characters are fresh and deeply wounded. A book that is as unpredictable as it is raw. The writing is clear and unpretentious. Not a word displaced by overzealous editors.PenetratingArmenianA Self Certified Blogspot Blogger
4,"""The Chocolate War"" is a must for all high school students.","Robert Cormier approaches the subject of conformity and teenagers with both wisdom and appeal. The reader is drawn into the difficult life of Jerry Renault and his high school experience. The Vigils serve as the original problem, but are surprised when the problem turns on them. This is a book that every high school student should read at least once in their high school career."
4,The Story was good but not as good as i thought it would be,"I thought the book was very good but way too long, the book shows a life lesson in the book that how a high schooler boy gets forced to be in a high school mafia, it shows how corrupt the world is.If you want a good lesson from a book i would recomened this book for you."
3,Interseting novel which requires some analysis,"""The Chocolate War"" is an interesting insight into the life of a young child forced into line by a mafia style school gang. It raises many questions about how safe students are in a school and how evil some people can be. However, one of the main characters, Archie, seems to be too evil to be real. Another main character, Jerry, is brave and seems to be very realistic in his depiction by Cormier. This novel shows how immoral some poeple can be in this world but seems too dark a future for the world. Many themes are raised including violence, evil and power and Cormier does a reasonable job in writing about teenage issues. Even though much analysis is required and a second reading is advised, this novel is good for study by high school aged students. A good read but nothing to write home about."
4,"Mmmmmm, chocolate!","I readThe Chocolate Warabout 25 years ago. I liked that book, so I figured why not read the sequel? I had forgotten a few of the plot points of the first book, but there was enough exposition here for me to get caught up quickly. The book takes place a few months after the Chocolate War, with most of the same characters. I don't want to spoil the plot, so I won't get into that. But I will say it's a very good book that will appeal to people who enjoyed The Chocolate War. Does Archie finally get his comeuppance? My lips are sealed."
3,The Chocolate War,This book is cool. The life like shown in this book is good. I like this book most because of the way it was put together. The characters are put in the right place at the right time. I like the ending of this book. It is weird.
4,great book! a must read!,i have realalized that these things help people and that is what this is for. this is an amazing book and children of all ages must read it! great for teenagers al alike. a must read for it's plot sensory imagry and thoughts of popularity + the world
4,An insightful look at teenagers' thoughts and actions.,"The opening of the book was utterly captivating, and the entire novel constantly held my attention. From the ingenuity, shrewdness, and cruelty of Archie and the Vigils to the timidity of Goober and Jerry Renault, this book gives an accurate look at what some kids really have to go through, and the thoughts that go through their heads."
3,"The Chcolate War is a good book, but not for younger readers","The Chocolate War by Robert Comier is a story about a school called Trinity; it's a private school. This group, called the Vigils, basically rules the school. The school has a chocolate sale, and the Vigils assign a boy, named Jerry, to not sell chocolates for two weeks and he does it. People start to look up to him, so he decides to keep not selling chocolates. The Vigils get mad and they challenge him to fight one of their friends and he loses.I would not recommend the book to younger readers because it has cursing and adult content. The book also promotes school violence because the Vigils go around torturing kids, and the teachers know about it and don't do anything."
4,Defying the Universe,"Jerry Renault enters high school unaware of the evil power in his new school, Trinity. This excellent novel demonstrates the consequences that occur when Jerry tries to be true to himself and obey only his own laws. Since the outcome of this is very realistic, ""The Chocolate War"" is an interesting novel to read. READ IT!!!!! IT'S GOOD!!!!!"
3,Our Review of The Chocolate War,"The Chocolate War by Robert Cormier is a book about a boy who experiences dramatic events in his first year in an all boy catholic academy. We found this book to be rather depressing, although it was also very realistic and entertaining. This book is worth reading once, but a little too dull and drawn out to be read a second time."
4,Cormier writes a novel rich in theme and parallelism.,"Robert Cormier's novel The Chocolate War examines many aspects of the adolescent experience. Who can't identify with the young protagonist Jerry Renault. Well crafted characters that seem to jump off the page, as well as a lot of symoblism. This is a great book for young adults."
4,Chilling and Truthful Book Most People Can Relate To,The Chocolate War was a riveting and truthful tale about the Catholic Boys' School. Robert Cormier did an excellent job depicting the pressure of high school!
2,CW Review,"The Chocolate War is a strange novel. In the story, one Jerry Renault is going against his peers and refusing to sell chocolate, and under the peer pressure things eventually escalate to violence.I didn't enjoy this particular novel very much. I didn't relate to the characters or the plot. I thought the school in the story to be very unusual and didn't understand it well. It may have something to do with the fact that i don't find the genre appealing.I wouldn't recommend reading this book, but you may want to consider looking at other people's reviews and opinions before immediately discarding this novel."
5,Chocolate War Reviiew,"The Chocolate War was a truly inspiring book. I believe this book was excellent, especially for teens my age. (9th grade) This book showed a great similarity between the real life of modern day teens and the fictional characters in the book. I suggest to any Freshmen in high school to get this book."
4,The Chocolate War,"Robert Cormier&#65533;s The Chocolate War is a terrific book. A feature that makes the book interesting is the fact that every chapter the story is told from a different character&#65533;s point of view. This changes your outlook on the plot, especially when an event is first told from the protagonist&#65533;s point of view, and then from the antagonist&#65533;s point of view. Jerry Renault, the protagonist, is an appealing character. His witty battles with his adversaries make the book interesting. The ending of this book is slightly questionable. It is almost too sudden, and the reader would expect more of it. I liked The Chocolate War; and I would recommend it to all mature 7th grade and older readers."
3,what my students think...,"I'm a high school English teacher and have used this book with 10th graders for the last 3 years. Despite the rave reviews that this book often receives from the Young Adult Lit critics, the majority of my kids find it boring and unrealistic. We read it and Catcher in the Rye in the same trimester, and most kids enjoy CIR more. As most of the reviews here state, if the book has any appeal at all, it's to 13-15-year-old boys. I would say that most of my kids find the most interesting part of the book to be the debate over it being banned in so many schools and libraries."
3,Definitely more for guys...,"I recently read The Chocolate War for an assignment in English class. The book did keep me entertained long enough to finish reading it, but that's about it. I'm a fifteen year old girl, and this book is written for about a thirteen year old boy. The book talks about looking at adult magazines and stuff like that from a male point of view. I was not interested, to say the least. The actual story line lacked any sort of reality, in my opinion. I mean, honestly, a kid doesn't sell chocolates and the entire school turns against him? He's ""disturbing the universe""? Personally, I would transfer out of this hoity-toity private school as soon as I could! The characters in this book are described well, though. You can tell that the author has talent, but he should've used it to write something that was actually decent! I would not have finished this book if I didn't have to for the assignment. Basically, I recommend this if you're a 13-15 year old boy, but otherwise don't bother."
4,good book- bad ending,"I thought this was a great book because it was written in an interesting way with no full story about any particular character. The story showed us how even the most simple of topics can become new and interesting. The author concentrated on showing us a different side of what we consider high-school life. The Chocolate War is definetly a page-turner with a lot of twists I could not stop reading. However, after reading I am the Cheese, I was hoping for another totally unexpected ending. I was so disapointed when I read this ending. I was just left wondering and surprised that the author would just leave me there with an ordinary ending. no twists, turns, or bicycle trips around an institution."
3,Not the best but worth reading,"When I first began this book, I thought it was going to be all about Jerry, freshman football quarterback. To my suprise there were a cast of interesting characters to learn about. At the end of the book, I wanted to know more about Jerry. The book was a little dated but still written very well for todays young adults. Left me wanting to read the sequel book, someday."
4,The Chocolate War,"This book is for the mature reader. This is about a group ofboys that got to an all boy school. Every year they sell chocolatesto the community. This year one boy, Jerry Renault, denies selling his 50 bars. As a result all the boys in Brother Leons class will not sell the chocolates. There is some swearing and some disgusting parts in this book but I reccomend it to boys only because they can probably relate to the boys in this book better than I can."
3,Disliked teenage book,This is a back and forth teenage life story. How a new freshman comes and expects to be different. But as the story prolongs he has to beg a differ. Even though the story might sound interesting you might want to first read more reviews. I will not give the story away but this is not a book you would want to read. The book starts off slow. It also does not stick to one plot. There are various points in the book. There are graphic teenage actions in the book.
3,Confusing,I give this 3 stars because it was boring . I say thisbecause the chapters jump from one thing to another. But I won't like to read a book like this anymore because it was confusing.
2,"It was interesting, but it could of been better.",This book was not very well developed. He doesn't do a very good job of describing a high school and a teenage boy. He forgets what times are like now. I only read it because I had to read it in my englis class for a literature group we had to participate in.
2,Interesting novel which depicts many thought provoking ideas,"Robert Cormier presents many relevant themes to teenagers and adolescents in todays society. The evil, manipulation and corruption of teachers and students in schools are shown to extreme, but relevent lengths through the issues. The novel presents main characters views towards individualism and following the crowd. The storyline is interesting however has some gross but true pictures in the readers mind. Exagerrated but quite true. Not the best I've read."
1,Rotten Chocolate,"The Chocolate War was not one of the best books I have read. I do not really think that it was realistic at all. I think the book starts off pretty good, but they never change the scenes and it is pretty much the same routine and gets really boring. Also, the author never changes the characters. So, in conclusion, I would probably not recommend this book to a 9th grader or older, but maybe to a 7th or 8th grader."
2,stupid and waste of time,"This book was stupid, confusing, and a waste of time. I really didn't get the point. If your in to books about guy's in a all boys school touching each others butt in the halls as a sighn of frindship. Boy's in gangs trying to pull pranks on teacher. Asking the same question over and over again weather or not the main charecter is gay or lonley. if you don't want to waste your time DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"
3,The Chocolate War from the perspective of a 15 year old,"The Chocolate War is well written, and describes violent events in graphic detail. The ending was an anti-climax, in that things just go on the way they are (which is terrible), but this is really the point of the book: the goodies don't always win, active evil will triumph over passive good, apathy and conformism breed corruption and violence. This is not a feel-good book, but the writer's craft is apparent all the way through."
5,A Character Builder at it's best,"Cormier writes a great discription of one child's growth and change do to the cruelty of bullies. It gives new meaning to the words ""character builder"""
2,I am 13 and Thought it to be very uneventful,After reading this book I felt as though the something was missing. It was very non appaeling for me and it took me an extremely long time to read. It was so bad my mother had to force me to read so for all of you people who loved well i hated it
3,The Chocolate War Talks About Individuality,"The Chocolate War makes you think about how individuality can affect a person's life. The main charcater is faced with peer pressure and has to deal with choosing to listen to himself or his peers. I liked how the book stressed individuality, even if it meant torment and being looked down upon. I didn't like how the book introduced the characters. There were a lot of characters introduced at the beginning of each chapter which made it confusing. The chapters were short,and because of this it made it easier to pay attention to the book. It was meant for highschool students because most of the issues in the book dealt with things that people in highschool deal with every day. I think this is appropriate for highschool students. I would recommend this book because it has a good overall message about being true to yourself, and that is important for all highschool students to read about."
4,The Chocolate War-Theme Centered on Conformity,"The Chocolate War, by Robert Cormeir, opens up a window into highschool. This book's theme centers around conformity and peer pressure. ""Dare I Disturb the Universe?"" is the quote that sums up the theme. The Chocolate War was not of the best quality of writing, yet it still managed to come out well. There were a few scenes that there were no reason for, in terms of moving towards the climax. Cormeir is great at detail, but if you are offended easily this book is not for you. There are a few references to masturbation, but too many, I thought.All in all, despite the disgusting aspects of the book, as well as the scenes not needed, the Chocolate War is a bit more than ok and a bit less than wonderful."
4,Forgotten Voices of the Great War,A fantastic read. This is not a story book this is real thoughts from real people in a very real war.This book really takes you into the minds and souls of those very very brave men & Women.Excellent. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that the book could have been longer. My only grievence. Thanks to the brave who lost their lives. Long may their memory live.
3,Inspiring but basic ....,"A great book for someone who is clueless about business and does not know where to start. The book has good examples and makes sense. However it is aimed at small businesses and people with hardly any business experience. If that's you, then get it, otherwise skip the read!"
5,MUST READ for anyone starting a business (or even if you're already in business!),"This is a great book. It helps you organize your thoughts thoroughly, and make a great business plan skeleton which you can fill out and add to/subtract from, based on your own individual needs and that of your business.I'm the type of person who always has new ideas on how to build a new business or market an existing one, and this book provided a lot of valuable insight into organizing my thoughts so that we could proceed the right way when starting up our new venture.You most likely have heard the saying, ""if you fail to plan, you plan to fail.""I totally believe in that saying; it's true. That being said, you should read this book, so you can create an effective plan, even if you already know how to make a business plan. The insights that this book offer are worth the measly price of the book! And you can write it off your taxes! Handle it."
2,Laswell has been sniffing too much glue.,"This album is Not the music of Miles. No polyrhythms, no funk, no groove; only Bill thinking that he knows Miles"
2,"Bill Laswell, you are no Teo Maceo","Why do people want to mess with things? Editing Miles? Adding dub echoes does not do much for Miles Davis. Hip-hop drums didn't on the horrendous 'DooBop'. Its best to leave Miles alone. And if you think his music is too long, use the >> button on your cd player."
1,I think somethings missing,"Well I dont know, this album was just not doing it for me. The complete absence of music was maybe it....maybe. It was like background music, and Miles forgot to play his trumpet over it. Theres not much on here except airy and repititous nothingness. Sorry guys."
4,Great Reference,"Part of the excellent series Warship Perspectives, this one on Flush Deckers or 4 Pipers as they were called has some wonderful enlarged photos with great detail, showing how these ships were converted and used as long-range escorts by both the British and Americans during WW II. Especially informative for the modeler is the research done on ship camouflage and various armament configurations. Well worth the price."
2,"Good, not great book.","This is is not the better of Mr. Callihan's two HTML books. It is fine if you are just interested in putting up a basic webpage, but too cursory for intermediate to advanced users. It does have a good explination of the Web and the Internet and their basic protocols. It also details the basic anatomy of HTML. However, the tables portion of the book is limited at best. Both frames and forms are omitted for the most part.Users interested in anything more than the most rudimentary webpage should look to Mr. Callihan's ""Learn HTML in a Weekend."""
3,Depends on Your Level of Knowledge...,"To the person who understands Html, what uploading files to a server is and the ins and outs of the lingo, it is perfect. But...if you are in fact a stranger to html, have no idea what acronyms mean, take a course. This book assumes that you are already involved in web page design of some kind. It is not nearly as thorough as it should be. To me if you are teaching a completely clueless person you need to hold their hands through every facet and put a generous sprinkling of tutorials in. This book does neither. I tested it out on 4 completely clueless people and they remained that way, gave it back to me and asked me to write their web pages for them."
3,Very Basic,"Very basic info, I am not sure I would want to publish a web page I created only using this information."
5,Great Resource for Beginning and Intermediate Webmasters,"After looking through quite a few HTML web page resources in my new job of putting together web pages, I was pleasantly surprized by the completeness and ""readability"" of this book. HTML commands are explained from an expert viewpoint, but not with so much detail that the reader becomes bogged down. Steve Callihan has written his book from the perspective of what a Beginning or Intermediate Webmaster will need, covering not only the HTML language, but also shareware text editors, graphic editors, and additional instructional resources."
5,If You Are a Beginner Get This Book,"This is a great book!!! The author does a great job explaining what each tag does and also shows examples in the book. If you read this book starting on Friday, you will be able to construct a webpage on Sunday. My advise in regard to using this book as a guide is to type all the examples from the book into notepad and see how it comes out as you read the book. That way you'll have an easier time remembering some of the code when you create your webpage on Sunday (you can also use the book as a reference when creating your first webpage). If you already know basic HTML, then skip this book and purchase a book that goes more in-depth in regard to HTML such as a Sam's book(I just ordered the Sam's HTML & XML book, but I have not gotten it yet)."
5,Great book for the first web page,"Better book than I was expecting for my personal web page. The language is relaxed, yet substantive and concise. The schedule set in the book is truly achievable for anybody (it seemed to me) who uses a computer daily, yet is not a ""guru"".I also loved all of the software he offers on the accompaining CD (graphics and FTP software) and the list of useful web links that he offers in the back."
4,Great price...,Amazon had the best price I could find for the Kury floorboard pegs. They beat the motorcycle online shops by $20 or more. I had mine powder coated before putting them on (Kuryakyn chrome is terrible) and now they look very good...but it will take a little bit to get used to them.
3,What You Get...,"The titles included are CASTLE FREAK, in which an American family inherits a spooky Italian castle; RETRO PUPPET MASTER, which finds a puppeteer trying to save the woman he loves from an Egyptian curse; SIDESHOW, in which normal people are transformed into circus freaks by an evil ringmaster; and, finally, CREEPOZOIDS, which follows five survivors of a nuclear war."
3,Okay versions of great tunes,"I am a huge Asleep at the Wheel fan--even waiting hours in a crowded bar across the street from Wrigley Field to hear ""There ain't nobody here but us chickens...""I find the live versions of their great songs just a bit worn around the edges. The vocals pushing to get a crowd excited but not adding much to the sound. It curiously lacks some of the verve and humor of their studio albums.Maybe you can only sing the Chickens song so many times...But if you want to fill out your AatW Collection, this album provides a good example of their material."
4,Asleep At The Wheel-Greatest Hits: Live & Kickin,"A great toe tappin',foot stompin' cross section of the music of AATW, small warts and all."
3,Available elsewhere,This is a combination of the Jazz Casual show and the Sound of Jazz clips missing the Billie Holliday clip.
4,ALMOST EXCELLENT BUT WITH TOO MUCH TWIST!,"ROCCO DIED ON JUNE 6 2006 666, HMM? BOOK IS GOOD TO READ YOU CAN FEEL MULDOON, BUT Y WOULD GOD ALLOW HIM TO DIE 2 DAYS BEFORE HIS BDAY, GOES TO SHOW GOT IS SOMEWHAT GOOD BUT LEANIN MORE TOWARDS NEUTRALITY! N I KNOW MANY MORE SERIOUS EXAMPLES, WORLD SHOULD NOT HAVE EXISTED, IN MY VIEW ITS 90% NEGATIVISM WITH PESIMISM, 10% MAY BE POSITIVISM, FACT! WHAT GOOD (EXCEPT SOLAR SYSTEM N FEW STARS, HALLEY'S COMET) IS WHOLE UNIVERSE AND IT MY THEORY THERE IS MULTIVERSE WHEN ALL IS USELESS. HEMINGWAY WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID UNIVER5SE IS COLD EMPTY HOSTILE PLACE! THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE BIN BANGS, I BELIEVE THEORY OF EVERYTHING EINSTEIN TRIED TO CREATE IS IMPOSSIBLE, JUST LIST STRING THEORY BECAUSE THEY CANT AGREE ON ONE, THEORY OF EVERYTHING WAS WHEN UNIVERSE WAS IN EARLY STAGES, LIKE ELECTROMAGNETISM GO HAND IN HAND WORK WITH GRAVITY BUT R NOT JOINED!FACTS! SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, THIS IS THE TRUTH I PROVED!KEEP ON WASTIN TIME INGRATES!"
4,Techno Rock,"This is a good album if you are into the likes of Snake River Conspiracy. It's a well done, electronic rock album. They do seem lack a little in talent, but it hardly shows."
1,So Bad That Some Folks May Consider It Good,"It is inconceivable to me that four people perfectly capable of uttering coherent statements (cf. their recent interview posted on Rockbites) would record such utter trash as anything but a practical joke.I would characterize both the singing and the music as ""amateurish"" if there were any evidence that Lolita Storm is *trying* to sound decent. However, there is evidence that the whole mess is quite deliberate, as evidenced e.g. by the lyrics (""He treats my like a doggie, he beats me 'till I'm groggy"") and drum programming on _So Bad I Love Him_, which cannot adequately be explained by stupidity and *have* to be attributed to maliciousness.Definitely not my cup of tea, buy your mileage may vary."
4,The Madman's Return,"I listened to this stuff all the time when I was little and I still enjoy it now. It is like a mix of techno, dance, electronica, and hip-hop all blended into one sound. I like the lyrics of most songs are the beats are crazy techno stuff that still sounds great today. My personal favorites of the album are:1.Rhythm Is a Dancer2.See the Light3.Madman's Return4.Who Stole It?"
1,No underlining means NO UNDERLINING,"Joe from Virginia does not realize that when his description says:Used - Very Good NOT an ex-library copy. A clean copy with no underlining, highlighting, or other markings.Joe - No means no, nothing. My book has three different colors of underling throughout. This is not a big deal - what is the big deal is that you lied. Your description should have read:A little underlining.I gave you one star because you lied."
3,Andwella's Dream - 'People's People' (Vivid Dream),"The British / Irish psychedelic band's 1971 record - personally, I liked their 'Love & Poetry' effort a bit more (see my review). Tunes here that were so-so include ""Saint Bartholomew"", the low-key ""Four Days In September"" and the title cut ""People's People"". Obviously, this CD simply didn't do much for me. Andwella's Dream looks to have at least four lp's out - including a later release where the band shortens their name to Andwella."
5,"A ""GREAT"" READ",THIS AS A ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL BOOK. I ENJOYED EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER. THE CHARACTERS TAYLOR AND DONALD HAD ME WANTING A SEQUEL. WHAT A LOVELY COUPLE.
3,Enjoyable but needed a proof reader,I will read another of her books as it was a nice light read but it was clear they rushed to publish as there were a lot of typos
1,Weak & Repetitive,"I'm glad I only paid $2.99 for the Kindle version of After Dark. The book keeps saying the same thing over and over again. The main characters, Taylor and Donald, keep repeating themselves and the story line is flat."
3,Enough Already,"I know this is supposed to be a romance but the back to back love sessions were a bit much. We don't have to have details every single time they make love. An author is prone to run out of creative scenes. And why must most of the main female characters be so hard up with chips on their shoulders? Yes, men love a challenge and women who play hard to get but too much independence and bitchiness is a turn-off. But the author did touch well on the life of a celebrity. Donald was my only likable character."
4,Loved it!,"I loved reading this book. My only complaint was all the typos throughout the story. I'm a romance junkie, so this was right up my alley. I would reccommend it to anyone and everyone, couldn't put it down."
3,Enjoyable,"I thought it was good. Taylor had a cute innocence and vulnerability about her. Donald was your successful pro athlete who actually had to work for a woman for once in his life since Taylor was not turned on by all the glitz and glamor. I thought all the negativity about Alex going pro was a bit unnecessary, but oh well.I would have given this 4 stars but this book has the most typos that I have ever seen in a digital book. There had to be a typo on every 2-3 pages. Someone really needs to edit this book and re-upload it. I really don't see how these were missed."
4,KLF,"have been looking for this album for years, it has been redrawn in Australia. mostly good but having the same tracks repeated does not help."
3,"some good, some great","last train and 3am and what time is love are classics. the rest is just ok.this album coulda been much better, but its good. some of it sounds dated though.those 3 classics are the sole reasons to own this.KLF!!! UH HUH UH! UH HUH UH HUH!KLF IS GONNA ROCK YOU!"
2,3am not eternal,"3am eternal is the best song on this album. Some of the other songs are good for dance, but most of them aren't made for playing at a dance party. 3am eternal is a good song and the cd is worth buying used, but not new."
5,Devastating Dance!,"This is quite likely the most devastating dance music on earth! Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond's ""ambient house"" comes with an assaulting beat and surrealist tone that induce an involuntary ascent into the celestial regions. What Time Is Love is pure bliss, while Last Train To Transcentral, with its dark undertones, will keep you raving. This is classy, quality music for the head and for the feet. One of the best albums of the 1990s."
4,"Harold & Kumar: Doogie, Where's My Burger?","One of the years biggest suprises for me. I dismissed this film at first as another teen movie full of crap and not much else. Boy, I was suprised! Dude, this is funny! knee-slappin', lockjawed rippin' laff out loud funny. It's also nice to see these characters aren't pure white goodie goodie boys, they are Asian and Indian. They are real characters and not a one note underdeveloped joke. Well written and full of great cameos. The best is from Doogie Howser himself. Great casting and fast paced direction make this film a keeper."
1,It stunk,"This is a movie about two guys who love to do drugs and, while high, develop a craving for a certain fast food burger. On their journey to get these burgers they do more and more drugs. This only makes them happier. One of them even has a dream where he marries a bag of marijuana. In the end, they set out to get more drugs. I'd say these two young men have a problem. But drugs only seem to add fun and adventure to these guys so why not? I didn't find most of this movie to be funny. Potty humor, gay jokes, and racist jokes aren't what I call entertainment."
1,too many scratches. doesnt work,they inside of the dvd case on BOTH dvds was broken and didnt hold the dvds in place. they are both covered in scratch and barely play.
1,Not a comedy; a mystery.,"(1) Why do people think any of this is original (Cheech & Chong)?, (2) Why do people think its a big deal because the characters are not white (Cheech & Chong)?, (3) Do college students these days still obsess over smoking joints? Dude, where's the black light and the Peter Max poster?, (4) Why do movie critics go out of their way to like this?, (5) Why are the effects so unconvincing - like finding a stuffed racoon in your car dude, (6) Why do the farting girls have such incredibly bad fake English accents?, (7) Why did White Castle agree to this?One star for the Kumar's fantasy of marrying a bag of marijuana. This sequence eased some of the pain."
1,13 year old kids with strict parents will dig this...,"I wanted to laugh ""genuinely"" at this one... unfortunately this flick is just way too insanely dumb. Neil Patrick Harris's appearance is pretty darn funny,... but then there's the hang gliding and the computer generated animals and just about everything else in this film... (yawn)File this one between the Tom Green ""Freddie Got Fingered"" disaster and the last Jay and Silent Bob flick. Some 13 year old kids with overly strict parents will enjoy this one at a sleepover birthday party..."
3,SIlly Fun,"Not typically my kind of movie, but as mindless entertainment it was actually quite fun.Plotless really except for the standard oddysey road trip, but it is very funny at points and boasts such ridiculously absurd encounters that it is enjoyable.Both actors are fine in their roles and add an extra offbeat dimension to the film. A new Cheech & Chong?"
5,Very Funny...,"If you don't laugh while seeing this movie there is something seriously wrong with you bro., and I mean serious.The movie was hilarious and so was this DVD with the bonus ""back-seat interview"". I never heard of these guys although according to the movie they had some small parts in other big movies. Nevertheless they both did a great job. The scene to look for is the bathroom scene with the two British and HOT chicks. It is too funny. You should watch this movie."
3,This movie is SURPRISINGLY very funny...,"In this movie...we meet Harold and Kumar, two stoners who are determined to find a White Castle before they go home.They encounter some of the CRAZIEST adventures...including a very interesting run-in with Neil Patrick Harris (actually playing himself).This movie surprised me. I was actually laughing pretty much throughout, and even with the so-so acting and excessive boob flashing...I really did enjoy myself. You find yourself wanting White Castle burgers yourself!"
3,Lame,"Better than Dude, Where's My car - but that's not saying much. H&K is an average pot toker movie that goes no where. It's not funny and at some point plain mean and racist. Not worth your time or money."
3,Decent comedy !,"It was a solid funny movie.There was one scene with a cheetah and the two guys rode it and it just wasn't real looking.Other than that it was a decent comedy.Doogie Houser was in it along with (cameo) Jamie Kennedy.I wouldn't buy it for 20 bucks ,more like a 15 dollar movie."
5,The Best Film Ever,"If you are a stoner, this is one of the best films ever made! Strait up, this is the sh*t as far as stoney cinema in the last few years at least. TRy watching this masterpiece while eating a large supply of White Castle. WE get it in the frozen section but maybe you will be able to get it fresh.Anyway, if you are a stoner, then you must see this film!"
5,One of the best comidies of 2004!,"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle [Swallow that big title!] is a fun movie. When I first heard of it, I was like, ""Seems like a long ad for White Castle to me."" But I watched it in theatres anyway! And I loved it!THE STORY: Harold and Kumar are two stoner roomates. Harold is an Asain dude who has a crush on a girl named Maria, and Kumar is an Indian guy who likes weed. One day they see an ad for White Castle and get hungry! So they drive over there, running into hilarious obstacles along the way!As you see, it's not a serious movie, but it's fun! The DVD is also sweet! Oh, BTW, the sequel, ""Harold and Kumar Go to Amsterdam"" is coming soon!"
4,For a good laugh.. these guys will do that.,"Ive seen this movie at least 10 times and have enjoyed it every time. I just didnt have a dvd, so i bought one and it was well worth it for the price and good laughs. I still want to see the Harold and Kumar xmas movie they did, that looks hilarious to me."
4,extremely funny,"""Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle"" is one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen. Though the jokes sometimes get a little stupid, I was amused throughout the film. Though the plot of the movie isn't very original (two stupid guys getting high and going on an adventure that features a lot of sex has been done before), I still found the film to be outrageously funny. I guess that type of plot line never gets old. I first saw this film two years ago and have seen it twice since. It was funny all three times. However, if you don't like crude and blatant humor, you probably won't like this film, since that type of humor is displayed throughout. Despite that, I love this movie and would recommend it to most people."
3,Sounds like a preview,"I've never seen this film but I think I've seen a preview of this from working at Waupaca Color Graphics when the owners secretary offers me a white castle burger and she being some kind of item to any loser that walks into that establishment.Sounds really put-onish, sophmore like and just plain vindictive. Go to White Castle for a run of diarrea, no thanks!The film is probably very funny and typical of these egomaniacs."
2,Don't give in to the hype,"I read most of the reviews on Amazon and decided to buy this movie. I then spent an hour and a half waiting to laugh at something. This movie suffers from one major flaw: it is just not funny. They have the right actors, a decent setting, and what should have been a hilarious story - two guys with serious munchies getting to Whitecastle - but failed to pull any of it together. If you could imagine taking all the parts from the American Pie(s), Road Trip, Half Baked, Euro Trip, and others of the genre that were cut out for lack of humor, you get this movie. All the potential was there but this movie fell flat. If you are thinking about buying it, don't. Just watch Half Baked for the hundredth time and you will laugh more than you ever would watching Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle."
2,A stupid movie with cheesy jokes.,"I had high hopes for this movie, but it disapointed me very much. The jokes were really silly, and if I were 10 maybe I might find it amusing. The subject matter has appeal, but the movie is just a bub trip."
3,"okay, but not great","I expected a little bit more out of this movie but it is not something that I would purchase on DVD. This movie could have been a masterpiece. The regular sterotypes, the Indian guy aspiring to be a doctor, the criminal Negro, the nerdy Asian, the idiot white guy. WOW! I don't want to give away the entire plot of the movie. Now don't get me wrong this movie had some funny moments. Some of you reading this expecting the movie to be totally awesome, but its not what you think. Trust me!! But you will get some good laughs out of it tho."
2,"Dude, why the pretension?","This could have been a really fun movie and I am disappointed that it wasn't. Had it just stuck with the cheese-o-rama approach and showed high-ons cavorting through the night it would have warranted three stars and a smile, but it kept forcing some bogus social consciousness into the story. Disappointingly, this film has an all-too-predictable politically correct edge to it. All of the white characters, and I mean all of them, from the snowboard dudes to the cop, are offensive and racist; whereas, all of ""people of color"" are good. It's absolutely ridiculous and reaches a low point when Harold runs into a guy who's in jail for ""being black."" Yawn. Come on, make a movie about slackers about slackers and not about some half-wit trendy ideology steeped in bashing whitey. Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda should not be the target audience for a film with a premise like this one."
4,"DUDE, WHERE'S MY POT?","The director of ""Dude, where's my car"" doesn't seem to have grown up. Good for us! His latest offering once again plops smack in the middle of youthful roadtrip comedies, never taking itself too seriously. No reason then for us to.Its meagre ambitions are limited to a couple of boys' misadventures, as funny as anything playing out these days, which predictably give way to toilet dalliances and other cheap shots that expose the director's craven desire to 'be cool' with the ear-pierced skateboarding crowd.Such ambitions are of course met without much fuss, and despite its scattershot social barbs, the film sports a loose goofball charm that certainly makes it a worthy popcorn getaway."
4,Stupid but funny,"If you liked the humor in the Revenge of the Nerds movies you should definately like this one. This movie is so stupid but has some gut-wrenchingly funny parts nonetheless.There are a lot of stereotypes (racial profilers, Indian convenience store guys, etc.) thar are played out well in a humorous way.No matter how far the pair travel, they seem to run into the same people are end up back at some of the same places. And yes, the movie did make me make a trip to White Castle, where I hadn't been there in a few years."
3,Mindless Fun,"This is far superior to most of the movies cranked out in this genre with some classic takes on gross out moments (though the girls playing a toilet version of the game ""Battleship"" almost had me wretching).The actors playing Harold & Kumar are likeable and it's a nice turn to see stoners played with something resembling intelligence. The movie wisely pokes fun at itself and at just about every religious and societal group imaginable.The movie is worth a watch if only for Neil Patrick Harris playing himself as a shallow Ecstasy tripping, sex-obsessed former star. It's nearly impossible not to break into hysterics at the idea of Dougie Houser getting aroused by (and involved in) a car seat.Hardly great movie making, Harold & Kumar is still a helluva lot of fun. Especially under the influence."
2,"good for selling white castle burgers,AND THAT'S IT!","This movie had a couple of funny parts, but basicallyit sucked. Get wasted and you'll enjoy it more! Thengo out and get some white castle burgers, and some toiletpaper."
3,What's legal in Amestradam..................................,"Roommates Harold Lee and Kumar Pate after ""blowing trees"" get the urge to munch something different. IMAGINE that right now you're flipping the channels and what's that a commercial? The power of advertising...It's a White Castles commercial, and Roldie and Kumar get to drooling as they settle on a road trip to score sliders, fries, and cokes.EXCEPT...White Castle appears to be somewhat of a JOURNEY to say the least! As they burn up the turnpike trying to score a sack. It appears to be one disaster after another.This movie had me in tears...Harold ""Twinkee"" gets the freakin' guts he finally needs to set the people in his path straight! Even Kumar slouching azz seems to decide to go get what's unavoidable.Who knew that comedy became Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser M.D) and Christopher Meloni (Law & Order SVU)!HI-gh... hi-GH... hI-gH... An ethnic stereotype. Okay I'm feeling this here!"
2,Harold and kumar white castle blu ray.,"Unfortunately my copy doesn't work because it's the wrong region. Bummer. Next time I'll mention that I need a disc that will play on Australian blu rays, before thay send it to an Australian address. great pricing and postage though."
4,Silly but Fun,"I generally find this genre ridiculous, but this film is kinda silly but fun. It is creative than most and is refreshingly frank and openly honest about many things. It is like finally finding a good friend that you can trust. Good acting and not overboard in any area. Just cool."
5,See it right this second,"Harold and Kumar is without a doubt the funniest film to come out so far this year. It is the first film I've been to in a while where the entire audience laughed the whole way through. I know it will become a stoner classic, but there are some truly good insights into common modern stereotypes. The extreme guys are one of the best parodies I've seen. Rush out and see it as soon as you can."
4,What happened to Doogie Howzer?,"Okay, maybe I spelled the name wrong, but after watching this movie, you won't care. This was a funny movie, and the scenes with Neal Patrick Harris will unsettle you just a bit.Friends of mine have been telling me that I have to see this movie, so I finally caved in. I have to say that I am glad I did. Although this movie has more than its share of drug reference and nudity, the story is engaging. On more than occasion, I not only laughed out loud, but I also thought the story touched on a good point, such as ethnic stereotyping and karma.The ending does leave open the chance of a sequel, which could create another franchise like the Cheech and Chong movies. However, given the growth of the characters, I don't see how a sequel would work.I would recommend this movie for a laugh. And you might want to get directions to the nearest White Castle before you watch the movie."
3,Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle is FUNNY!,Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle is the original and far superior to the sequel. This is a very funny movie centered around smoking pot and getting laid. There are some very outlandish scenes but none funnier than the cameo by Neil Patrick Harris.
2,"Been there, done that...","While this movie is entertaining, there is nothing new or special about it. There are many, many better and funnier movies to spend your time with.This movie is all over the map with little to really to bring it all together, almost as if the writer/director decided to simply throw a lot of random and what they thought would be funny moments together (ohh, he gets bitten by a raccoon, ohh, this really ugly guy has a pretty wife, ohh, Dougie Howser!) It just seems like what it is, a bunch of random events overdone to try and get laughs.Pass on this one unless you watch it stoned, maybe its better that way."
5,Great Movie ~ Excellent Service,The movie is fun ~ need to have an open sense of humor. Delivery was a day earlier than expected ~~ which was a nice surprise! Thanks Amazon!!
3,what about Krystals?,"In line with all of the other road trip/teen movies of the last few years, this fits right in there, not as special, just mildly humorous.Why just look at the premise? Two minor foreign character stereotypes from other teen films go searching for America's finest, White Castle. Yeah, it's weak, and honestly a bit better then most in this genre, but still just average overall.The characters themselves are funny, while the situations are okay. As expected the adventure leans to the obscene, perverse, and raunchy. Some like that; however, I was just amazed that the trip was semi-interesting.Now, I know this is going to be upsetting to read for those who like this type of film, but it is really just average, and probably less. Nevertheless, if you found other teen films funny, then be prepared for the humor. What can I say, but to each his own."
1,Horrible,"Very simplistic review here:As a fan of comedy, this movie sucked. Not worth my time or money. Save your time, and your cash."
1,This Film Sucked,"I'm a fan of this genre (stoner flicks, buddy flicks, road trip films), and I was really looking forward to this movie. But this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities except that it's in focus. I'd rate this ZERO stars if that was an option."
1,Asians on Drugs,"Being an Asian immigrant who likes to occasionally eat at White Castle, I was interested in seeing this film. It turned out to be worse than I could have imagined. The movie is about drugs, drugs and more drugs and there is nothing funny about it. White Castle hamburgers make an appearance at the end but mostly it is drugs the Asian characters want. They smoke marijuana all the time which is not like any Asians I know. The white people in the movie are always calling Asians names but that is not like any white people I know either. In the real world, it is only the Black and Spanish that have called me names because I am Asian. I would only recommend this movie if you think it is funny to watch Asian people smoke marijuana."
5,Harold And Kumar Make Me Laugh My Arse Off!,"My wife wanted to rent this. I went into it with a bad attitude. Having seen ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" I rolled my eyes and didn't expect much. Couldn't have been more WRONG! This is one of the side-splittingest comedies I have seen in a LONG time! Grade ""A"" toilet humor, the best stoner humor since Cheech & Chong hung up their bong, and all around madcap craziness. Went and immediately bought the extended, unrated version with great relish. Need a laugh? Harold And Kumar hit the spot better than a belly full of Sliders. ENJOY!*warning* If you are going to be a big, poltically correct baby and are put off by the comedic use of broad ethnic stereotypes, this movie is not for you. If you understand that anything is fair game in the interest of LARFS, watch this flick."
4,Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle,"The director of 'Dude, Where's My Car?', made a better job with this movie. After smoking marijuana, two roomates go on a trip to crave their desires for burgers.This unrated version features some bonus hot material that wasn't shown in theaters. Like nudity, and language that will be satifying. Also with commentaries with the casts and the filmmakers, interview, featurette, music video, and more. Also with DVD-ROM features, too.I recommend this to anybody that wants to see a feel good movie."
1,EXCRUCIATINGLY BAD TEEN COMEDY,"If you like non-stop drug references and disgusting sex humor, this movie was made for you. Idiotic tale of two guys who seem to have it all together but are obsessed by marijuana and sex. Stupid, stupid, stupid. The extras on this DVD were useless too. Save your money.If this is was today's teenager consider entertainment, we're in a lot of trouble."
1,HORRIBLE,"Since this doesn't allow for negative stars, I had to give it one star. If I was drunk and high this would still not be funny. Awful movie, don't waste your money or time."
1,What idiots!,"Kumar and Harold go through all kinds of nonsense, violence and hardship. When they finally persevere all these tortures and runarounds, what do they get?37 White Castle burgers. The equivilent of a 1 and 1/2 Whoppers to split between them.They saw a damn Burger King in the beginning of the movie. It would have been a whole lot cheaper and tastier to just have gone there and saved an [backside] load of money as well.Idiots!"
4,Hilarious,"One of the funniest movies in along time, for many reasons. It's fresh, with a different cast than most comedies and it got a new kind of plot for a stoner film. It's got nuances for those in and out of drugs and it keeps the viewer entertaiend throughout. It's hard to not be pleased with this film."
4,They went through hell for....HAMBURGERS?!,"This movie, while it does seem to perpetuate the stoner's image in society, does provide a few laughs for those who can stand it's plot lines predictability. Although it does follow the same plot line as one of the films by the same director (""Dude Where's My Car""), it is lovable and the characters don't learn too many lessons. THANK the writers...There is no big moral and they don't sicken you with too much character growth. Go see the movie. Don't expect it to change you life, just expect to be entertained."
3,OK,strengths:One chick was somewhat hot/The plot was somewhat funnyWeaknesses:The dialogue was boring at times/Only one somewhat hot chick/scant nudity/no laugh-your-azz-off scenes
1,Not the Right Movie,I ordered this movie and when my boyfriend opened it the movie inside was the 40 year old virgin . . . Im not very happy about this . . .
5,Great Disc,This is a fantastic disc. You get all the old DVD fetures plus the picture and audio are steps up from the two prior old DVDs. If you like this movie get this Blu-Ray version of it.
3,worth a rent or a cheap purchase,"I got quite a few chuckles at the humor contained here. (I love the raccoon.)Certainly not for everybody and I wouldn't buy it.However, if you chuckle at Roadtrip or American Pie or stoner type humor, you could do much worse than Harold and Kumar."
5,Harold and Kumar go to White Castle is funny!,Harold and Kumar go to White Castle is funny! Harold and Kumar are so hilarious that I could not stop laughing after the movie was over! When I watched it I felt that this movie is blessing for those people who are looking for Asian-American role models! John Cho plays Harold Lee and Kal Penn plays Kumar. Harold Lee is a Korean-American and Kumar is an Indian-American who are looking for White Castle Hamburgers! They spend one night out looking for a White Castle fast food resturant! This movie is funny! Highly Recommended!
5,hilarious!,"I basically laughed my way through the entire film. The only reason I went to watch it is because my parents are Indian, and up until this movie, the only Indians I've seen in movies are either doctors or convenience store owners--and they all have accents. So being able to see a ""normal"" Indian in a movie, a guy just like everyone else, was definitely a plus.That being said, the Indian guy thing was only a bonus. The jokes in this film were absolutely hilarious; I watched it TWICE when it came out in theaters, and both times I was in tears (from laughing) by the end. There were some parts where the plot became a little too ridiculous, but for some reason, it was still funny.Some people have said that the humor is immature or stupid. If you are an adult, you will probably not like this film (although my mom did). This is definitely a movie for teenagers, even if you aren't into gross humor...I'm really not, but I found the ""gross"" jokes in this movie to be funny."
3,This movie gives me the Munchies,"Sliders, you like em or not. Harold and Kumar was one funny movie. I think that it would be better appreciated by the stoner crowd, but it still has enough gags for us sober folks. I really found the cameo from Neil Doogie Howser when he does a line off of a nice looking girls rear to be the ""high"" point of the movie. Yes there are a few hot chicks in it to boot! This movie is worth a look, but it might not be for everyone."
3,Has it's moments,A handful of hilarious moments amid 90 minutes of cliched silliness. Has it's cake and eats it too with all sorts of racial stereotypes. The rest is standard pothead humor. Maybe I would have enjoyed it if I was 15 years younger...or high.
4,Great addittion to any kitchen!,"As I get more into cooking, I find that having the proper tools is key to turning out some amazing food. Since being banned from outdoor grilling at my apartment building, I bought this to satisfy my grilling needs. This pan counts as a great asset to anyone's kitchen.The cleaning gets easier as you continue to use this pan; I've had mine for about two months, cooking with it regularly and the smoke is still an issue. Hence four stars instead of five.With practice, this pan has turned out some really good food! I did my Guinness brats on it, and they were the best! Steaks cook to perfection in six minutes with sweet grill marks. Well worth it."
5,Better than a BBQ!,"What really amazed me is how bacon comes out on this grill. I tried bacon to season the pan, but I only cook bacon on this thing now. Even with the fattest bacon I got, the fat just drips down in the ridges and you're left with perfectly cooked tasty lean bacon!I've also tried chicken breast and burgers, and they both came out nice and juicy. The chicken breast had to be finished in the oven. I mostly use this pan instead of my BBQ now!I own a 12"" Lodge pan with cover, so I am familiar with the use and care of cast iron. After use, I drain the fat, scrape it with a metal spatula, heat the pan, then pass a paper towel soaked in grapeseed oil.Sure, there's some smoke, but I try to use leaner cuts and turn on the fan. I live in a 1br condo and it's not a problem with the smoke detectors.The only thing I wish is that it came with a fitting cover just like my 12"" pan. That would greatly limit the smoke, and heat the food all around so I don't have to finish thick cuts in the oven."
2,Leave the grilling to the outdoors,"Grill pan works well, was able to cook a couple steaks over the stove but a few negatives that, in my opinion, outweigh any positives:1. Entire apartment gets filled with smoke. Not sure how this can be avoided.2. Cleaning is a pain. If you purchase do yourself a favor a spend a few extra bucks on a cleaning brush3. Because of all the smoke, apartment smellsI really wanted to like this pan but in the end I think the oven broiler is the way to go"
5,I love it!!,I love this item. Bought it since I know a friend who has it and she uses it to grill her meat burgers on it whenever they werent feeling to barbeque
4,useful,"The food stuck to the pan right out, but like others, after seasoning it did a beautiful job. I had a dinner for some friends and made teriyaki chicken Skewers. They were really good. The only thing I haven't figured out is the cleaning and that smoke. Overall, great buy."
5,Good...but smallish for my needs,The Lodge Grill Pan works great. I especially like the fact that the raised grilling bars leave nice grill marks and transmit heat much better than my last grill pan. After trying to grill a big mess of veggies I realize I should have bought the one that covers two burners. I should have gone big.
2,Not for electric range,Just a warning-- I would caution against using this type of pan on an electric range.. I mistakenly bought it and found out that you have to be careful when cooking cast iron pots and pans on an electric range because the burners create hot spots that can cause the pans/pots to crack.. You basically have to heat the pan slowly and do not heat it past medium.. really not worth it for me.. but too much trouble to send it back.. I will give it to a relative who can use it instead..
4,Love this grill pan!,"I bought this Lodge cast iron grill pan and have become a big-time fan of both grilling and of Lodge. What a great product this is. Burgers, hot dogs, pork chops, steaks, vegetables...it all comes delicious and extremely easy. Cleaning the grill pan is pretty easy -just follow the manufacturer's instructions. It is somewhat heavy but still comfortable to handle. Happy grilling to all!"
5,"Can't ask for more indoors. Well, perhaps one thing...","First off, to address the ongoing 'pre seasoned' debate: I have not seen any cast iron unseasoned products out there. Second, I never use their seasoning; I scrub the thing down, coat it in bacon grease and bake it 24h at 200F and that has always produced a perfect season. Heck, I brought back by great uncles lodge pan from probably Great Depression from 30 years of sitting in a wet moldy house with a scrubber, then seasoning. This pan has high enough grill lines to actually keep the oil / juices off the meat. I would say that the best method I have used so far is the same way you would grill something. Heat up the pan until its super hot, sear the meat, then reduce the heat and cover it with a lid (which I wish they would produce!) Worked great. Water in the pan, scrub out, and a spray or splash of oil and the residual heat will re season. For $17, for a grill that will outlive you, its a deal."
5,Nice pan,"I bought this for my boyfriend, who loves grilled meat. He was excited about those stovetop grill pans that span two burners, which I find clunky and hard to store. I thought this was a nice compromise.He is very happy with the purchase, and uses it daily. I would think that this was one of the more expensive pans if I hadn't bought it myself! The grill grooves are deep for nice hatch mark capability, but far enough apart that they are easy to clean in between. We've been using it inside even though it's still warm enough to grill out! A great choice and an even better value."
5,Awesome,"Ordered this a little bit ago and just got around to using it, and all i can say is that it works great!I was even talking a few friends of mine recently. Mike usually does all the cooking for my other friend Rick, to say they enjoyed using this product together is an understatement. Mike liked the fact that he could bring the essence of grilling inside on the stove top, and Rick liked the fact that he can cook with Mike, giving them a feeling of togetherness in preparing for their next meal.Whether it was for day time grilling or night time grilling, they have made the majority of their chicken and/or their famous sausage sandwhiches.I will say it is a little heavy, but Rick and Mike double team the cooking efforts, so that is not an issue. Also, very easy to clean of food staining! Just don't leave water in it or it will rust.I agree with Mike and Rick...must have grilling tool!"
3,Ridges are deeper than other grill pans,"I just got this for Xmas and have always loved grilling with cast iron. I think I just need to get used to this pan but the ridges are alot higher than I am used to so that when I pour oil or put butter in the pan it settles in the bottom and the meat still sticks to the ridges! I've started oiling the meat itself instead. Other than that, the pre-seasoning is nice but I'm not sure it is worth the extra cost as you can get a regular cast iron pan pretty inexpensively."
5,American made,"I love this pan, all you have to remember is the factory seasoning is not enough... all you need to do is fry a pound of bacon in it then wipe it out toss into a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes and voila! pan works great!"
5,New favorite kitchen item!!!,"Where has this been all my life? I have had the best paninis for breakfast and dinner, and grilled venison was wonderful! Clean up is a cinch."
1,Awful and heavy,"This grill is ridiculously heavy. I used it once, put it in the dishwasher, and I had to return it because it was all rusty when I took it out of there."
1,Not a great product,"Unless I did something wrong, after one use everything got so stuck to the pan that I had to throw it all out including the pan. You could not clean it with a hammer and chisel."
1,boooooooooooo!,I left water in it for 15 minutes to help get out a tough stain... it rusted and put a rust stain on my counter. Never again.
3,"Good, not the highest quality","When I received my grill pan, it already had some of the surface layer flaking off on the handle. This was annoying, but didn't overly concern me since it wasn't touching any of the grilling surface. So far, I've used it to grill a steak, chicken, and some fish and I've been very pleased with the outcome all three times. It was the closest I've ever come to replicating the taste of the big grill outside in my kitchen."
5,Great Grill pan,"I like to grill some meats and fish indoors. This pan is great for that, though it can get a bit smoky. I would highly recommend also adding the Grill Press. As for cleaning, I find if I clean it while is is still orig. warm (not re-warmed), it does clean on a snap."
3,be careful of pan measurements,"I bought this pan specifically to go with my 8 1/2"" X 8 1/2"" metal press. Because the measurements given were 10 1/2 "" X 10 1/2"", I felt certain my press would fit inside this pan. WRONG! The Pan sides bow out, and of course the measurements were taken at the widest points and on the outside of the pan, not the inside. The four corners of my press will not fit inside the pan.I have no input on the pan itself as I have not used it before returning it for credit. But I will say this: it appeared to be an good pan and the price was fair. Too bad it doesn't fit my press."
3,Great grilling/difficult washing,"I love grilling in this pan. The food always comes out perfect and I get compliments galore. Cleaning is a nightmare. If you use any types of sauces, they stick to the pan and are almost impossible to get off."
5,LOVE IT,I use my cast iron pans now all the time. Cooks great every time and will last a lifetime. I recommend it
5,George Forman George Schmorman,"I just got this pan for my birthday, and i LOVE it! Nevermind the meat, its fantastic for grilling vegetables/tofu as well. My grilled eggplant was eggcellent. Living in an apartment I don't have access to a barbeque - but who cares now that I have this pan?!?I would say this is a rich man's George Forman Grill, but at the price its going for...its just better.Cleanup is a dream.Cast iron cookware is good for you, no snarky chemicals. A wee bit of extra iron in the diet is good for us ladies as well."
4,My 1st cast iron,"this is my first cast iron cause all these years i've been using T***** product. i want healthier food so i used this product cause i read that T***** has some health issue later on. it's heavy, hot & need a special care to clean it but so far i'm happy."
4,Heavy,This is a very heavy grill pan that does a good job with the steaks and such.I have many extra round lids and found a couple that covered all but the corners which stoppedany splatter and still gives the grill a chance to breath.Clean up is (as usual) a bit of a pain in that you have to deal with the grill surface and ofcourse the weight.Good pan for a specific purpose.
4,Works as it should,"Since it is pre-seasoned, the purchaser can avoid a little work. As it turns out, the pan is not as useful as I anticipated when I decided to buy it, but it works just fine. I used a little cooking spray and grilled some vegetables on a couple of different occasions and it worked great. Since I do not eat meat, I cannot comment on how it works on, say, a steak, but I cannot imagine that it would be any different. Also, if you are unfamiliar with iron cookware, it is very heavy. It you have weak wrists or similar problems like my wife, this might not be a good product for you. However, it does had the loop handle opposite the regular handle, which helps when handling it."
2,Grilled fish stuck to pan,"First time use - sprayed pan with cooking spray per instructions, even added extra olive oil on fish. Fish stuck to pan and was shredded during removal attempt. Less than ideal results."
1,Everything Sticks!,I'm not sure if it's because mine is not pre-seasoned but I have tried to cook chicken and fish in this pan and they both got stuck. I used PAM and it didn't make a difference.
3,Ambivalent..Like design but much too heavy.,"It is exactly as pictured however, never imagined it would be so heavy.Husband objects to it's usage as it will scratch up the range top and ruin each burner because it is so weighty/heavy.."
1,Heats unevenly,"I am very disappointed in this purchase. The pan heats very unevenly so while the bottom is VERY hot and tends to burn things, the top grids are hardly heated and do not cook properly. I've tried grapeseed oil, peanut oil AND olive oil - everything still burns. Not happy at all!"
3,"Good job, but very hard to clean","I was all ready to grill some marinated chicken breasts on our outdoor gas grill when I discovered we were out of propane. I grilled them inside on this cast iron grill and they turned out better than on the grill. I did use olive oil to prevent sticking and medium heat. The reason for three stars is clean up. The marinade that dripped out of the chicken hardened within the grooves during cooking. It was so hard to clean. I tried heating water in the pan, putting in oven with water and ended up scraping out with a butter knife. It worked but took about 15 minutes. Hamburgers were much easier. I am still a huge fan of cast iron. They are the only pans I use. My all time favorite is Lodge Logic circle griddle.Lodge Logic L9OG3 Pre-Seasoned 10-1/2-Inch Round Griddle"
2,A Little Disappointed,"I should have paid more attention to the size, because I didn't realize it was only big enough for one sandwich. That being said, it's really cute. My real complaint is that the instructions claim there is no need to turn your food, because it will grill from both sides. I learned that the bottom will burn, if you don't turn it. Not happy about that."
2,Shipped Late and delivered damaged..,"This product was delivered two weeks after the date indicated when purchased. Produect had a large crack in the cast iron. Upon returning I was told I could not receive full refund because I waited too long. In reality, it was due to the late shipping and I never got a full refund for a broken product never used."
2,high maintnance. very disappointing,"i wouldn't have bought this pan had i known how high maintnance cast iron cookware are. there is a strict set of instructions for cleaning and caring for the pan to prevent it from rusting. for example, and i'm quoting the manufacturer website:*clean utensil with a stiff nylon brush and hot water*Towel dry immediately and apply a light coating of oil to the utensil while it is still warm*Do not use soap*Do not let your cast iron air dry, as this can promote rust.http://www.lodgemfg.com/use-care-seasoned-cast-iron.asp#2had i known i'd have to work so hard to clean this pan, i wouldn't have made the purchase to begin with. big disappointemt"
1,Not worth the effort & no less grease than a more versatile stainless pan,"Maybe for a campfire or park for sanitary reasons.Does function better than an over priced sandwhich maker when cooking chicken breasts.This grill pan is not worth its price or storage. It's too heavy for most normal cupboard shelves.A large stainless one pot is more versatile & produces no more grease than this grill pan.Skip any of the tv's creative ideas of adding tomatoes, onions ect with chicken breast in one pan. Creativity is done for by comparison. Spices super glue themselves to this grill pan's seasoning making a nasty mess.Very dissapointed & irritated with the thought of re seasoning after a simple casual grilling of hamburger or chicken breast.Extra oven seasonings do in fact come off come off with hot water (not boiling water) cleaning as directed."
2,i love this.....,"i really enjoy cooking steak and pork chops in this pan. my husband now cooks steak better because of this pan. a great buy, you can't go wrong."
1,Watch Out - So Much for Pre-Seasoned,"We were so excited about trying this pan, what a major disappointment. We have only been able to use it once since the chicken we cooked in it has become a permanent part of the pan. We have scrubbed, soaked and without having the pan sandblasted, the cooked on food won't come off! I have never been so disappointed about a product before this one. Why pay for a pan that can only be used one time. I'm ready to throw it out and stick with my old reliable pans. Not even worth a penny!"
4,Makes great steaks,So far all I have made in this grill pan is a steak. Could not believe how good it was. Something about cast iron that makes the food taste better. Very satisfied with this purchase.
2,Smoke!!!,It's quite strange only one reviewer mentioned smoke problem...Maybe we are doing something wrong? But every time I try it still hoping this time it would be better I still end up in the clouds of smoke. Fire alarms are set off and the apartment reeks for days. Not suitable for apartment at all!
3,Environmental ambient,"This CD contains 3 tracks: Sonic Alter, Heaven Below and Heaven Above. The CD insert suggests the music is for an electronic meditation. To me is is, however, too disturbing. The main always-present sound resembles the sound of water stirred in a bucket. Other sounds build on this."
5,A lovely collection of songs with religious underpinnings.,"This is a diverse collection of songs having a religious flavor without being overly religious. The songs are sung clearly and enthusiastically with a minimum of orchestration, except for an occasional organ. The soloists excel. For those not familiar with this group, it is a truly great find. ""Take Me Home Precious Lord"" is the most moving song on the album, but you will find many others that you will recall throughout the day and night. I play the album frequently, and it ranks very favorably with albums by English vocal groups."
5,An Excellent CD,"My pastor bought me this CD and I wasn't sure I'd really like it. Chorale music? You must be joking. But I popped it into my CD player at home and was immediately astonished at what I heard. The Kansas City Chorale have done an outstanding job of singing hymns of various types, most without musical accompaniment. Track 7 (""Encouragement"") is my absolute favorite song on this CD. It is so beautiful to hear, especially when I crank it on my big stereo or over my headphones.Bottom line: if you like chorale music, religious music, or even classical music, you will really enjoy this CD. The quality of the recording is very good."
5,Mid-America Choral Music,"This music has a sense of sophistication along with a sense of Midwestern plains, earthy and innocent, spirituality. I love it. I can imagine the singers standing center-stage in a concert hall or before a crowd in a European Cathedral; but also I can see them sitting in pews in a small, country church in Kansas. I'm at peace when listening to this music."
5,Vividly descriptive of Kalahari & Bushmen yet meditative,"This was a wonderful book. Although, at times the author brought down the pensive, spiritual level with his complaints regarding the practical complications of his expedition, overall, this book is extremely moving. The only way you could get a better idea of life in the Kalahari is by going there yourself; he describes, in beautiful, vivid language, the plant and animal life of the desert, the variety of cultures, and the consequences of the European settlement. The book unravels like a mystery, with the mysterious Bushman always lingering just out of reach, a figure between reality and legend."
3,Error in specifications,Chances of the motor on this being 1300 watts as described are none and non-existent. It's big brother (Lello 2730 3000 Pro Pastamaster ) is rated at 300 watts. Amazon needs to correct the description.
1,Does not make usable pasta,"While it is sturdily constructed, this machine just woul dnot make any usable pasta. No matter what I did pasta always came out with jagged edges.. more flour, less flour, more liquid, less liquid, etc.. When boiled the pasta would become an unusable lump of dough. Not recommended."
1,unhappy pasta maker,My Simco pasta machine broke a few years ago after giving me many years of great pasta. I tried to order another and found out Lello bought out Simco....so I spent $150 bucks on what looked like a comparable machine.It seems the same but the pasta is so hard and dry it will not go thru the extruder....I threw my old recipe away so I can only guess that the recipe included in the Lello machine is wrong......I am in the process of experimenting but so far have been very disappointed.
1,stripped 2 blades,"I bought this based on the reviews and metal parts...but the shaft is metal and the blade that moves the dough around is plastic...inside as well where it sits on the shaft. The shaft has rounded 2 blades now...I can't afford to spend 25$ on a new shaft every time I make pasta. The pasta turns out great, so I don't think it's a consistency issue, but I'm sure that is what they will blame it on."
4,nice little pasta machine but the company doesn't have online ordering,"Bought this to try making my own pasta. Machine works very well. It comes with a few different dies but if you want more, you have to either call in, or fill out a paper form and mail it in. There's a bunch of different dies you can get for different pasta's. Machine seems powerful as it has never stopped running while using it."
4,Great product,"Failed miserably the first time as I followed the instructions closely, but got better and better the subsequent times. It's very difficult to get the half-walnut sized doughs in fact. I ended up using less water and just divided the dough into half-walnut sized pieces from time to time, and the result is great!"
4,I recommend it,This is my second pasta maker. I had my 1st one for years but recently broke it because my dough was too tough and it snapped the plastic. So I read the reviews and tried this one. My first batch I was worried about the consistantcy of the dough so I threw it out. I'm a little gun shy. The second batch turned out great! I would recommend buying a scale to exactly measure the flour. The key to not burning up your machine or breaking it is definately in the dough! Good sturdy machine.
5,Really great Pasta Machine,"This is an awesome pasta maker! We have had 2 machines before this one. They were both inferior products. The first was ,I believe a CSX . It was heavy duty except for the nylon gears which soon failed. We then got the Ronco. That was such light duty,we gave up on it. The Lello is truly heavy duty,and works well. It is necessary with this,or any pasta machine,to be sure that the dough is the correct consistency before extruding. If you do that ,this machine should give excellent service."
2,Seller doesn't support the product,"We enjoyed making pasta with those product for almost a year. Now the shutter that must be in place while the dough is mixing has broken and there is a crack in the pasta bowl, both after normal usage. I enquired if spares are available but I just got a message from the supply that it is more than 90 days after purchase, implying they do not want to discuss the issue of supplies or replacement. I have owned two previous versions of this design, both made in Italy and they lasted several years. Not sure what to to next. Don't expect this item to be supported or last more than one year and you will not be disappointed. The supplier's response is disappointing but I will try to find another source than amazon and this supplier ""kasbahouse"" as they do not stand by their product outside the 90 days which seems a sort time given that this item cost $200"
4,Great book to spend an afternoon with,I have been enjoying this series immensely and think that this is the strongest book yet. The characters are interesting and pull me back time after time. I enjoy being part of their lives. The book is a fast read and pulls the reader right in. It is an enjoyable ride.
2,Reality Check,"Carrie Carlin's world has all the ingredients to hold her readers. However, it is Carrie Carlin herself that I found hard to take. Carlin's thought processes for intruding into investigations are both boring and unrealistic. Tesler would do well to work on depth and credibility in her main character."
4,I really good book.,"This book was really hard to put down. I finished it quite fast, and it's a pretty big book. The author has written it very well. I look forward to reading more of his books."
2,Criminal Ways Indeed,"In 2002, Nick ""Wog Boy"" Giannopolis wrote, stared in and directed ""The Wannabes"" a silly, slapstick comedy about a gang of criminals who pose as a children's entertainment group, with former soap star Isla Fisher in a minor role as his love interest. The film, shot in Melbourne, copped bad reviews at a time when Aussie comedy was not flavour of the month with Australian film reviewers or film goers.Fast forward to 2009, Isla Fisher is a Hollywood star, and the Wannabes has been re-released with a brand new title and cover artwork, marketing Fisher as the star of the film for the benefit of the yanks or anyone else who may have missed the film the first time around. The film isn't as bad as some of the Australian reviews made out. Just. Still, only a fool or a diehard fan of Ms Fisher would consider paying $[...] for this slick piece of marketing. Criminal indeed."
1,Why is Elsa Fischer on the Cover?,"Not much to this movie. Lame, unfunny, uneven caper movie filmed mostly in a garage. Elsa is barely in it."
4,AMAZING,"This Dimmu Borgir album is simply AMAZING, truly a work of art. This is definitley one of their best. Unlike Death Cult Armageddon with the use of keyboards, this album is pure piano and synthesizers, and has that more ""horror/gothic"" sound. The guitars could've been at tad better which gives it 4/5. Other than that this album is perfect and a must-have for any Dimmu fan out there."
4,Stormblast,"Many have said that this release is a flop compared to others, and, to tell the truth, it does take some getting used to. If you are looking for brutal, fast, grinding black metal, I do not recommend this album. However, to the open-minded ones, this album owns. It sounds like it has some real talent involved - the fourth song, Sorgens Kammer, is a six-minute-long piano solo. Know that if you buy this album it may at first be a disappointment, but I guarantee you will warm up to it. This is overall a kick-arse album, and I recommend it to metalheads and metal-haters alike. 4/5"
5,Simply beautiful,"This album is one of the best you can get! It has some really beautiful keyboarding work. Sorrowful, graceful, sweeping melodies grace my ears every time I listen to any of the tracks here. This is Dimmu's last album done in Norwegian, so anyone outside the Norwegian circles will NOT be able to tell what they are saying at all.Do yourself a favor, and buy this album."
5,A classic,"First of all to anyone who says black metal is really sad, etc, etc - why are you taking it so seriously?! It's only music, and, as it happens, in this case, very good music. You can laugh at it at the same time as enjoying it. This album has some truly haunting songs, mixing classical elements with pure black as black metal. A masterpiece."
5,"""Another winner !""","I have previously purchased 2 other Brooks & Dunn CD's, so I am a fan. This maintains the style & variety we have come to expect. Title song is my favorite."
4,Good CD!,"I like Brooks and Dunn so I liked this CD. I got it for an excellent price and it was shipped quickly. Typical Brooks and Dunn, good vocals and nice music. I recommend this CD to all their fans."
5,the greatest,i think these guys are the best thtas ever been and eer will be not to mention mr.brooks looks like my husbandto be and i love all their musicand also think they have awesome voices. every song holds a memory in my life at sometime or other.
4,Cutest Thing,"This was a cute, sturdy horn. Holding up nicely. The only reason why I am giving it a 4 is because it won't fit tightly on my son's handbars. There are two different size bars. One is too big and one too small. I put it on the one that is too small, so it doesn't want to stand up and stay put. Otherwise it is great."
4,Wonderful History on the Church of God,"I found out about this book recently and was pleased to find the name of my great uncle, Thomas James Richardson, who was the first Black overseer in the Church of God. Though the book is thorough in some respects, not much is said in its pages about the issues of racism within the church, and some of the reasons why the church separated in 1922 with the beginnings of the Church of God of Prophecy. However, this book in particular, and others generally with denominational histories are necessary to give readers and students benefit of the various early doctrinal understandings, distinct Christian practices, and leadership successions. Though I am now a Baptist pastor, I owe much of my fervor and passion to my beginnings in the Church of God."
2,not meant for a microwave,You can't microwave a drink with these mugs. The mug itself gets very hot while the contents do not. They're nice to look at but not very useful.
5,Dying Yound Movie Soundtrack,"CD arrived as described in product description and in the time frame specified. Saw the movie and forgot how much I really liked the music. Great price, too!! Beats buying it at a retail store where I would have paid much more than the amount I paid for it here."
1,May the lord help us,"Listening to the first track by Mr. G was enough for me. Why don't you pick up ""Nocturne"" by Charlie Haden if you want something relaxing. This album would most certainly cause me to die young after listening to it for more than 5 minutes because I would probably shoot myself in the friggin head. If you have this album and like it, I can predict some things: You live in a suburban neiborhood, drive an SUV, and vote republican in every election you can. Am I right?"
3,Jeffrey Osborne Fan,"I was happily surprised to hear that Jeffrey Osborne was the male vocalist on ""All The Way"" Kenny G did a good job on this soundtrack. The movie was good as well."
3,Inspirational,"Only saw the movie this year, and really enjoyed it. (It's out on DVD in Feb 04). I picked up the soundtrack not long after I saw the film and was glad I did - beautiful, subtle, soft and inspirational are words which best describe it. :)"
3,"Good bubblegum, but not great fare.","How can anyone give this five stars? What are the Beatles, if not four? Bach and Beethoven, if not five? PLEASE, get some PERSPECTIVE!I liked this when I bought it in the '70s, but it's not the Beatles, Who, Stones, Zeppelin, etc. Come on!"
4,Versatile Flat,"I wear these all the time when the weather is nice enough. They go with dresses, pants, and skirts. They are true to size. Sometimes the stitching feels stiff and rubs the foot, but I have two pairs, and that only happens with one of the pairs. Overall, they are comfortable and stylish."
2,Good but short,"This is a very good book that goes into an often overlooked part of poker that it is very hard to make a living playing poker. However, It is a VERY VERY short book."
4,Great Read,I agree with all of the other reviews in that this is a great read! Even though the book is fiction I imagine the experiences are real. My only complaint is I would have liked more. The book is slightly less than a hundred pages. Maybe there will be a sequel which I would gladly purchase.
4,Good book if you have an interest of players personal background,"I have read about half of this book. I'm having a little trouble following his group of fellow players, and how they fit into his life. Mr. Adams lack of personality reflects in his writing. That is not to say he does not know his stuff. His mathamatical knowledge is of the highest level, and does reflect on his poker play. I notice he's going deep in some of the World Series Events this year. I may add to this review once I complete the book. What I am reflecting on most from what I have read is how important poker is to me versus haing a quality healthy life."
1,Bad Beat Story,"This reveiw will be short, like the 'novel'. You like bad beat stories? Read on.I paid my $10, and it arrived. I opened it and found I had bought 90 1/2 pages of 'novel' double spaced. Follow the math here. That is 45 1/4 pages single spaced. I read it in about an hour. Don't ask me what it was about. I was fuming too much about paying $10 for 45 1/4 pages to really care.45 1/4 pages are between a short story and a novella, but I paid for a novel. This review is over. Buy it if you too want to take a bad beat; I won't say, told you so.Or, you might want to get 'Shut Up and Deal', the best poker novel ever written."
5,A Chronical of Degenerate Exploits that Will Ring True to All Gamblers,"Broke takes you on a ride that only high limit poker players have been on. This book is a collection of short stories that some of us in the poker world remember all too well. While fiction, Broke is based heavily in real life experiences from Brandon Adams' poker playing adventures. A chronical of degenerative exploits, this book is a must read for anyone who plays poker or loves gambling!"
4,Quick read,"Read it in record time. i liked it, but wish there was more. It seemed to be genuine and interesting."
1,It's all about ridiculous love spells,"I've read through this book and found it to be complete nonsense. If you're looking for a reputable book on ingredients for spells, do not turn to this one. The majority of the ingredients mentioned are catered towards teenage girls who want to cast stupid love spells. And honestly, once I saw that the woman who wrote this is the astrologer for Cosmogirl and Seventeen, I instantly put it back on the shelf and felt disgusted."
5,Good information,Lots of information in this book along with other reference books for Magical ingredients one can usually find what they are looking for.
4,Ingredients,This is a very good book for all practitioners to use. It makes it very easy to quickly look up correspondences to use. Love it!
2,Great for Dungeons and Dragons Gaming,This book is ideal for Role-playing games but is far from appropriate for a serious Wiccan.
5,Accessible Book on Meditation,"This is a well written, simple and accessible book on meditation. The book serves as a great introduction (with helpful instruction) to beginning one's own meditation practice, as well as providing background on and the benefits of a meditation practice."
3,It's ok.....could be much better with updates and editing,"This book could use some editing and updating to be sure so I gave this book 3 stars. The information is good, helpful and informative. I learned a lot from it and I've actually done two projects out of this book, one of them was the mohair shawl. I have issues with the measurements of the warps and yarn weights specified in the book. At times, they make no sense at all. An example would be the directions to use a worsted weight yarn (960 yards/pound, think Malabrigo yarn thickness) in a 12 dent heddle. Ummmm.......it's going to be a precarious fit at best. The rest of the garments in this book belong (to stay) in 1987. There are also a few page discrepancies between the index and actual pages. Even though I am not enchanted with this book the way others seem to be, it's still a great book."
3,Better than Midrange,"It's hard to tell from the title, but this is neither a conspiracy book nor (entirely) a whitewash of Adm. Kimmel but a fairly good overview. The book covers the comprehensive blind spots, especially those in Washington, that lead to the surprise at Pearl Harbor. Gannon writes entertainingly and covers detail well. However I think his (deserved) admiration for Kimmel leads him to soft-pedal the parts of the evidence that suggest his culpability. The admiral deserves, although not the whole blame for being unprepared, a sizeable amount of it. Gordon Prange's relatively hard to find ""Pearl Harbor: the Verdict of History"" covers much the same ground as Gannon but does not hesitate to point out Kimmel's and Short's mistakes alongside everyone else's. And Prange (himself a WWII vet) knew and liked Kimmel personally. I don't regret buying Gannon's book but I would hate to use it for my sole resource on the subject."
5,PEARL HARBOR BETRAYED,"I have not read this book and probably will not. I feel thecase against our pre Pearl Harbor military intalligence was previously made in ""AND I WAS THERE"" by Rear Admiral Edwin T Latton,Captain Roger Pineau USNR and John Costello(William Morrow and Company, 1985). However, what books of this genre leave out or simply do not emphasize sufficientally is the role of an isolationist congress in the build up to Pearl Harbor. Hence,the search for scapegoats by the those who were most responsible for the disaster in the first place. Congress has rarely been guilty of foresight; but its hindsight is remarkable for its calunmy and slander after a disaster. TO put it in todays lingo Kimmel and Short were ""hosed"" by acongress only to willing to cover up its own dereliction of dutyand that of the pre-war Military Cheifs including the sainted George C Marshall."
4,"A good book, worth its price","The book takes a bottom-up approach: the first part shows useful coding and optimizing techniques, while the second one gives real world applications and tips on program design.I have two minor complaints, however:Most chapters assume at least a good knowledge of PL/SQL and build on that, which I think is fair for a book titled ""Mastering ..."". On the other hand, two of the chapters (Triggers especially, and PL/SQL Debugging to a degree) take a different approach and start from the beginning, explaining the basics, too. It may be just me, but I think those pages are wasted.Furthermore, there is a certain amount of overlap with Tom Kyte's Expert One-on-One Oracle, also from Apress."
1,only good for two minutes of hot water a shower,this system stinks! i was excited to have this unit installed as my old water heater was so expensive to run. after the installation was complete we tried to use the unit and found it only would heat the shower (right next to the unit) for two minutes at best. then you have to shut the faucet off for another two minutes and maybe you'll get hot water again. there is literally no customer service with rude people reading from a set of comments that they just recite. after two months of this i am at wits end and still can't take a normal shower. DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE RHEEM UNITS IF YOUR GOAL IS TO HEAT WATER!
5,My Favorite,"I purchased this CD when if was first released in 1995 and I had to buy another one so I could have one for home and one for my car. Everyone that I have had listen to this...loves it! Most had never heard of him and have since become fans. If you don't have this CD buy it. It's a great CD to listen to after a long day at work, very relaxing!"
2,"Ehm, not that good.","""Time Was"", well: Curtis Stigers' good time was when he did the album ""CURTIS STIGERS"". This album is absolutely different. I have to say that it's very well played and all the musicians are good. But that's not enough to make good music. I mean, this is not the Curtis Stigers I have learned. The armonies and melodies of the previous album are unique. So, if you don't know this artist, buy CURTIS STIGERS instead of TIME WAS."
1,Overpriced and misleading advertising,They are misleading people as to what this does. If will increase your blood pressure but not sure that is why people buy it. just read the ingredients and go to a health food store and buy for much less. Beware of out-dated product too.
2,Not so great,"I've taken other male hormonal support formulas with much better results. Notably, Gaia's Male Libido formula and others. This one ranks the lowest. I've taken for two weeks now and had very little positive effect. The pills have a nasty taste as well and are quite large and difficult to swallow. The blue coloring and marketing hype are clearly trying to get you to think this is herbal viagra and it's emphatically not."
5,"HOLOCAUST, WORLD BEWARE, THEY SHRED !!!","Ok, So if you want to hear the finest heavy metal thats been produced in years then this album is for you !!!!!!Holocaust are the Legendary NWOBHM band that have for some unknown reason been keep in the background.To my mind John Mortimer is the most talented song writer around and has been for years.Primal is the most powerful, grinding, pulsing metal I have come across, it simply blew me away !!This band have the most hypnotic way of playing together, they really seem able to rip the soul right outta you, once you play this album, you will be screaming for more from them.It was a long wait because of delays, but DEFINATLY worth the waitwait. Here's hoping their next album is real soon as Im screaming for more of them.!!!!They have changed direction with this alum a bit, very Slayer like, but with a tinge here and there of their old sound, but this is HOLOCAUST as you have never heard them.You are in for a HUGE SURPRISE !!!!!!BUY IT !! PLAY IT !! LOVE IT !!"
3,Novel of Anarchism -- As a First,"The minor characters here poop in their pants when faced with a crisis. A young boy has had his parents and his sisters kidnapped, but in the middle of the novel, instead of daily being at the task of rescuing them, he is exploring a new Utopia. The author seems to think he's set up the suspense dramatically enough that the reader will keep turning the pages despite the long deviation into a ""better of way of life"" scenario. Reading this novel is like reading the newspaper, only the facts are not as disturbing.The characters' names, all those who are not major characters that is, eventually meld together confusedly and meaninglessly in the rushing onslaught of the novel's denouement. The near-end and actual end of the story is action-packed and neatly ties together and resolves all the loose ends.There were incredibly adventurous passages in this novel that made it entertaining, but the whole did not transcend pulp fiction."
3,Average libertarian science fiction,This book is somewhat entertaining if you are a libertarian. But it is not great literature - a passable read.
4,Not Heinlein,"Some compare this work to Orwell or even Heinlein, sorry folks, its not.I detest unproven parallels. He is a good story teller, but feels jerky.Don't get me wrong, its an ok read with a strong message. But, you can getthe message with the poor story line."
2,Careless Formatting for Kindle,"I only read the sample, but that was enough. Absolutely no care went into converting this book to kindle. It is rife with carriage returns that don't belong. Often a line will have only one word. Very annoying. Very sloppy conversion to kindle."
5,Amazing Predictive Futurism,"Schulman describes the coming financial collapse of the United States. When he was writing he was looking into the future. Now that future is just around the corner, the horror of the end of the empire of the almighty paper dollar. The hyper-inflationary collapse of the economy is well researched and based on true historic parallels. His portrayal of the desperation of the ruling class during such a disaster is realistic. I would say moderate compared to the violence unleashed by some states upon their own citizens. His revolutionary solution is unique, but not utopian. All of this with a fast paced romantic action adventure story. It is well worth reading."
1,Kandy,"I feel this item was incorrectly advertised. It is stated that the bag is washable. In fact, it is made of an unwoven polypropylene product that looks and feels like paper. I do not think that it is durable enough to last through a wash cycle. I was able to put my fingernail through the material with moderate pressure."
1,Built to Break,"This was exactly what I wanted when I got it. After the first use, the screws started coming loose, so I super-glued them. Then the wheels started popping off, and I just put them back in as needed. Next, the seam ripped on one of the dividers, then on one of the outer panels. Finally, the frame collapsed. I threw it out after less than 3 months. I should have returned it when I had the chance."
4,"Go ahead and get it, good buy!",We are very satisfied with this product and use it daily in sorting and keeping of laundry. Would recommend this to anyone!
5,"a very good book,though at times boring",I liked the book even though it can get boring at times .Anybody not just people who like horses will enjoy this boo
5,"NOTHING TO SAY BUT ""WOW!""","This book was not what I expected. I expected Alec to enter a race with a horse in a foreign country or something. It was something close to that, but not how I expected it. This book is simply AMAZING!! I couldn't imagine any better way to continue the story.Alec is shocked when he learns that someone is out to kill his beautiful Stallion! The next day a man comes and claims he owns the Black. Alec is devastated. Mr. Volec, the owner of Sun Raider comes and decides to help Alec. The group travel across the desert with a young housekeeper and a guide. A sandstorm splits the group from their camels. Only Alec's is left. The guide was murdered during the storm, and only half a container of water is left. They push to their destination and kill the camel after collecting its liquid. They eat camel meat. How will the group survive? Find out in The Black Stallion Returns!"
4,Exciting and adventurous; over and under detailed in spots,"This book was about a boy's quest to find his horse. The excitement started right away but waned during his trip to Arabia. That part was heavily burdened with unnecessary details. Once Alec, the main character found the horse the excitement built up again. It reached its climax when an evil plot to destroy the desert tribes was discovered. The rest of the book was eventful to the very end. I would reccomend this book to people who enjoy adventure."
3,Awsome,It was one of the best books I have ever read I can't wait to read the next one. Hope you guys like it to
4,The Black Returns,"Abu the Black Stallions ownerhad lost his horse by going on a ship to a country and the ship had started sinking.The Black had saved a boys life named Alec.Alec had thought that the owner of the horse was really dead but he wasnt,which Alec didnt know that.Well anyways Alec had took the Black home with him and put him in a stall and took good care of the Black.Well now Abu had been looking for his horse for a while now and so he had finally found out where his horse was and went to Alecs house and proved ownership of the Black.Then Abu had taken the horse back home to their country and then Alec was really upset that he didnt have that horse anymore so Abu said that he could have the Blacks baby that was born."
1,An Insult To The English Language,This book is unreadable. The author has an extraordinarily poor command of English. The entire work is a nonstop display of improper word usage and exceptionally bad grammar. I show the book to friends and family so they can laugh at it. I challenge them to open the book to any page and read a paragraph at random. The result is a combination of amusement and horror. I suppose the entertainment value helps compensate for the fact that I feel I completely wasted my money.Which is a great pity as the subject is one worthy of study.I recommend you check out the first few pages of the book (which are currently available on this site).There are other books on this subject. Buy any of them instead.
2,Horrible!,"Don't buy these, they are awful. The vanilla meringues are wonderful, crisp and delicious. These are sour and moldy tasting, and the texture is mushy. The lime just makes them sour and there is no hint of coconut taste. Buy the vanilla ones instead."
2,Great Movie! I adore it!!,"But why can't we get it in widescreen? I hope all other animation studios will do what Disney has been since DVD became popular--digitally master the mateiral and print it in widescreen format. Cats Don't Dance, Last Unicorn, Land before Time, Swan Princess, An American Tail, and Secret of NIHM all deserve better!"
5,Great,"Great movie, the music is great; kids love theme with cats in a cartoon setting and telling their problem in a fun way."
4,Cat's Don't Dance,I always watched this movie as a kid and I loved watching it again as an adult. The music always gets stuck in my head
4,Should be a rating between 'like' and 'love',"Wow, you can get this in DVD again? Never happened here. Had to get it from US, ages ago. This is a wonderful animated movie which manages to be 'feel good' without being dumbed-down. Set in the mid 20th age of musicals, this is almost a cherised reference to MGM musicals of the era. It's truly faboulous, and -just wow. So why am I not giving it the top rating? Because, believe it or not, there are a few out there which are better.It's a real undercats story with all the romance, panache and whatever which you would expect from a 50's musical. Go buy it.Loop"
4,Better than I expected,"Tired story, silly humor, but it's obviously not meant to entertain adults. The animation is colorful, simple, and interesting, and the storyline moves quickly. A great one for keeping the attention of small children. Plus a warm, fuzzy, 'never-give-up' moral and great teaching opportunities."
3,Space jam?,"Tbh, I bought this movie b/c I saw the trailer on my old space jam vhs and it looked really good. It's not a great movie but definitely watchable. Good stocking stuffer."
3,FELINE FROLICS,"CATS DON'T DANCE is a toe-tapping, unusual little animated film featuring a host of musically inclined animals, headed by the stubborn and determined cat of the title. As voiced by Scott Bakula, the cat is determined to make it big in Hollywood, where animals aren't supposed to be stars. His nemesis turns out to be Darla Dimple, a Shirley Temple rip-off, who is really more demon than child. Darla and her bodyguard Max are actually the funniest characters in the movie and they steal any scene they're in. With a so-so score by Oscar winner Randy Newman, CATS DON'T DANCE is an entertaining movie, with some bouncy musical numbers and the message that quitters never win."
5,This movie is better than I though it would be!,"This movie is wonderful! I watched this one Friday night, drinking Pepsi and I loved this. Music is wonderful, story is wonderful. And this is funny, too! I love this kind of movies. And I bet that you're gonna love this...!"
3,As long as the kids liked it...,..that's all that matters. I remembered taking a friend's kid to the movie theater to see this when it was out in theaters years ago and it hasn't lost it's charm with my kids since then. An underrated animated feature.
5,A Family favorite,"My girls just love this movie - terrific songs and animation with some very funny moments that both my husband and I enjoy along with the girls. I was always a fan of old Hollywood musicals and there are a lot of sweet little nods to the classics in here. It's been fun explaining some of them to the kids, and made them want to see the old movie stars that are referenced and that's pretty special to me. As a kid, was a big fan of Gene Kelly (I was devastated to learn he was sooo much older than I was! HAHA!), who is credited as choreographing this movie. It was his final film and dedicated to him, which gives it a special place in my heart. I can picture his historic dance with Jerry the Mouse while I watch the dance scenes!"
5,Classic,"This is such a fun movie. All of our family, all ages, have loved this one for years. Great Music!"
5,Fantastic Movie,My daughter found this at the library and checked it out all the time!! I was so thrilled to find it for her and at such a reasonable price!!
5,Real stories behind the great man,"Listening to ""Buckminster Fuller An Audio Biography"" is like sitting at a coffee shop with Lloyd Sieden as he tells engaging stories of the life of his friend Buckminster Fuller. Stories range from Bucky's acheivements to his struggles to continue his ""life as an experiement"". The human side of Bucky is protrayed and I felt a connection with his unique spirit. I especially enjoyed the story of how Bucky's uncles raised money to pay for his college. With money in hand Bucky's interest in a good time diverted him from making it to college."
4,Makes you want to listen over and over.,"I heard this album reviewed on NPR some time ago and was really intrigued ... Hal Arpin's fusion Terra Verde style combines Scott Joplin's rag, the latin rhythms of Bosa Nova, and strong classical elements of Chopin. I went in the house and wrote the title down and bought it the next day. I've listened to it over and over. Would be great background music for a relaxing dinner party, but I have also listened to it with headphones and it's a treat to listen to. Hal Isbitz in my new favorite composer, and the pianist Arpin is a master."
3,An okay collection of a lot of beautiful individual pieces,Each of the pieces on this album can stand on its own beautifully and John Arpin does a wonderful job of interpretting every piece. But as a collection they don't go together well. Almost every piece has the same rhythm (some a bit slower and some a bit faster) and it starts to get old after a few tracks.
2,I don't like it!,"John Arpin's piano is too much like a Vegas lounge act for me. He has added lots of trills and flourishes which I guess thrills some people, but I think he's much more talented than his albums suggest. I wish he'd just play the music without the fireworks."
4,You can teach an old dog new 'treats',"this is not my first purchase of this item. I am especially pleased that my dog likes these, as she is very picky. Good to find something helpful for her joints, that she enjoys eating.Nutri-Vet Hip & Joint Lamb & Rice Flavor Wafers for Dogs - Medium Biscuit - 19.5oz"
3,shooters aid,"This product works, but is is rather expensive for what you get. In the future I would spend more for a better model."
5,Spaghetti with Meat Sauce Dinner,I was raised on this product and would buy it directly from Kraft or Sam's or anyone else who can find it. This was a staple in my house growing up and I never thought it would disappear.
5,?!?DISCONTINUED?!?,"I can't believe that Kraft would discontinue this wonderful spaghetti. You can't buy sauce that is even remotely the same. Not only should Kraft not discontinue it, they should market the sauce in larger cans separately. They would make a ton off of that!"
2,"ok-album, lousy record",really not the most inspired album of Jeff. But real lousy is only one thing: the sound quality. The sound engineer must have tomatoes in his ears. Much too much heights let you take this CD out of the player just after inserting. Jeff (and the Arista staff) should really care more for this!
2,"Nerdy defense contractors, you've found your book.","Prepare to be drowned in technical avionics details, at the expense of character development, suspense, and storyline. If you enjoy the intricacies of warplane operations, then you may enjoy this book. However, the storyline is forced and Brown depends on cliches to develop his characters. The planes are very real, but the individuals who fly them are poorly painted. In sum, only read this one if you're a white-collar defense electronics guru."
1,"Works, but not well","The home wall charger works fine, however the auto tape cassette adapter for my iPod which is what I really wanted I'm not happy with. The sound only comes out of one side of my sterio, the front right. And yes I've checked the fade & balance. And the side that does come out, sounds like it's through a 5 ft tin can. I couldn't even listed to audiobooks, it was hard to understand what they were saying. If I tured it up, the buzz was so loud the words were still muffled. Listing to music... forget it. I tossed it out. Very hesitant to order anything from Bargain cell again.I know it's a bargan, and as my husband says... just buy the real thing the first time so you don't waste your money buying the bargain cheap thing first then tossing it out and ending up spending more on the real thing anyway. He's dead on in this situation (but don't tell him I said that)."
1,Piece of trash,This useless item was bought on the assumption that it was a replacement of my original battery.This useless battery is less than half the power of the original.Buyer beware! Amazon should try harder to ensure that when they are fronting organisations like Batteries.com that their customers are not shipped a piece of rubbish like this.
2,Read the Ingredients - NOT ALL NATURAL,"Although this soap does appear to get rave reviews, I have a problem with the fact that it contains preservatives and chemicals(DMDM Hydantoin(which releases formaldehyde into the product!!, Pentasodium Pentetate,Tetrasodium Etidronate)yet they say its all natural based?? Luckily, through my searching I have found WendyLou's Natural Milk Baths and Soaps. They are homemade, with the glycerin still retained and are all natural based with either essential oils or fragrance added. I have very dry skin and her soaps feel so moisturizing and have a great lather, plus its nice to know I am using something without any chemicals and is vegetable based."
5,pure country,"This album by Radney Foster is good solid old fashioned pure country music.With alot of so called country music today simply not country this really is!! From just call me lonesome to my favorite Closing Time you can feel his west Texas roots.If you like real pure cowboy, drinking, broken heart country this ones for you!!"
5,Worth every song.,I sure wish this guy went on to do more. His song writing is fantastic. It is a CD I have treasured and listen to often. The words are marvelous.
4,Essential Americana for Any Music Lover,"Although the breakup of Foster and Lloyd might have been a bit untimely, it's not an understatement to say Foster did just fine on his own. Although the four songs that got repeated airplay on country radio (""Just Call Me Lonesome"", ""Easier Said Than Done"", ""Nobody Wins"", ""Hammer and Nails"") are my favorites, a lot can be said for the new-age cowboy songs (""Went For a Ride"", ""Old Silver""). It kind of depresses me that Foster only went on to write songs and not sing them. However, if you want the core, the beginnings, of alterternative country/rock, this is the album for you. I strongly reccomend it!"
3,Good but dated.,"This was an excellent and very comprehensive review of everything (and I mean everything) about the gay scene in San Francisco. Unfortunately, it was written in 1996 and is now quite out of date and needs revision.The chapters on the bars and sex clubs are good as are the chapters on restaurants and places to stay but call ahead - many of the places mentioned have closed.Still worth buying - just be a little cautious before getting yourself into a compromising position."
4,600 pages of engaging the reader,"Wow, this is a long one, but it holds one's interest. At least, it held mine most of the time. Also, being a collection of 35 years of essays, it's possible to pick and choose. I mean, it's not like you have to read from p. 1 to p. 600 without a break. Clive James is a critic, one who writes for the NY and London Reviews of Books, the New Yorker, etc., etc. he's made a name for himself by becoming one of the central voices of literary criticism, and this collection of his essays shows how and why he's become the icon of our times. It's a keeper."
1,Buyer Beware: These are NOT the original recordings!,"I knew it was too good to be true... I didn't realize it when I ordered this CD, but theseare NOT the original recordings. In tiny letters on the back of the CDit says ""the tracks featured have been re-recorded by the original artist."" Don't be fooled and don't make the same mistake I did (unless you like inferior recordings). You're much better off getting the more expensive but much much better Rhino set ""Twang Thang: The Duane Eddy Anthology.""NB: This is in no way a slight on Mr. Eddy who is an amazing guitarist and one of the truly important figures in rock and roll."
4,Not original but REDONE FOR DANCE.,"Don't listen to those other (so-called) reviewers, definitely there not very OBJECTIVE.This album set of Duane's is quite good. He re-mastered thisset with consistent beats for DANCE (hence the title).We know how rousing Rebel Rouser is, this re-version is calmly subdued and still enjoyable. Imagine yourself in your rocker, in a retirement home, with all your friends listening to the original version. Uhh-HUH, this remake will fit that ambiance perfectly as well as basement or backyard parties. Neighbors won't complain, this album might entice them to join.All the other tunes are redone in the same way, definitely worth the investment."
2,Where is the chocolate?,"I was very surprised when I first tried these, because I was expecting delicious chocolate but instead they are somewhat flavorless. Obviously the vitamins are great and needed when you're pregnant-but the taste is bland. Luna bars are much, much tastier."
3,Not worth the high price,"I enjoyed these as a treat during my pregnancy. However, I would not recommend them nor will I eat them during my next pregnancy. They are very expensive and there are much healthier (and more natural) snacks in the world. I'm going to save my money for more important things and eat healthier this time around."
5,Captivating,"David Russell is recognised as a master of romantic guitar music, and on this beautiful recording he pays homage to his Celtic roots, with his own arrangements Irish reels, Scottish lullabies, and folk songs.From the opening track, the blistering Bucks of Oranmore, to the lush title track Message of the Sea, Russells playing is never less than truly captivating, as always with meticulous attention to detail. Every ornament is crisp and consise, and standard classics like The Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond sound here as though they were written for the guitar."
4,"Very good, but not excellent","Many of the pieces on the CD are terrific, and played in the celtic style. However, there are several pieces that sound as though it is a classical guitarist playing the pieces (that's to be expected - D. Russell is a classical guitarist). Those pieces are the poorest on the CD (e.g. Fantasy on a Scottish Air). Despite that, I'd still recommend it."
2,How can they not be alphabetized???,"Recipe separators are virtually impossible to find. These should work well, but because they are not alphabetized, they don't. if you can find some that are alphabetized, I'd give these a pass."
3,But why ...,"These are nice dividers, sturdy and attractive, but why aren't they staggered alphabetically? Odd. And annoying. I have to wonder who selected the order in which they're staggered."
3,Only half great,"Don't know why they don't list both authors, namely John Esquemeling and Basil Ringrose.The first half by Esquemeling is stiff and boring. He lays it on pretty thick about the famous pirates like L'Ollonais and Morgan being totally vicious sadists. Esquemeling claims to have been an eye-witness but he uses the third person virtually throughout.The second half is very fluid and engaging. Actually made me sad that Ringrose met his end so prematurely a few years later whilst on a plundering mission with William Dampier.There's a fair amount of navigation details in the Ringrose portion, especially towards the end when they sail around the horn and don't sight land again until they reach Barbados! This is an effective technique for conveying the real tedium and totally lost, almost hopeless, feeling of such a protracted voyage. It also makes you realize how hampered navigation was before a reliable way of determining longitude was discovered a hundred years later."
5,excellent effective product,Good deal with both melatonin and valerian root contained in one capsule. Works quickly and calms even the worst of menopausal symptoms for a good nights rest.
5,Fantastic layout and great text!!,"I was surprised to receive a copy of a book called The Blizzard of '78 for Christmas. I had totally forgotten that the 25th anniversary was in February. The pictures and stories have brought back many memories. It's funny how many folks I talk to can tell me where they were, what they were doing, and how much snow was in their part of MA. This ain't a book for the scientific meteorologist folks. This is a scrapbook for those that were there, in The Blizz of '78. Thanks to the author Mike Tougias. Great job!"
4,Gods Will???,"Book is great. Really enjoyed it. I bought it because I was the cause of it all. LOL?? I dunno, but I know I was planning on running away at the ripe old age of 16 on the night that it began. I had loaded my car with food, a tent, a cot, hunting guns and ammo, fishing gear, a couple sleeping bags and a propane heater and lantern, etc etc. I'm getting ready to leave at 2:30 am and I find my car snowed in and a blizzard going on. Man I was so ticked off. Luckily my anger towards my parents abated and I didn't leave. I had time to think because of the blizzard. Did God create it so that I would not run away and turn into another statistic?? I don't know, but I'm glad it happened. Sorry I screwed things up for so many others.I know I'm not the center of the universe, LOL, but God does work in VERY mysterious ways in my and other folks lives!"
5,Brrrr.....,"2 weeks without school, making money shoveling driveways, watching TV and (along with my sister) driving my mother crazy. I'll never forget the Blizzard of '78! Michael Tougias has done us all a service by putting this wonderful retrospective of the storm together. True to another reviewer's complaints, it is not a meteorological book. Nor is it a collection of remembrances. It's a photo book with good text that tells the story. It's a scrap book for everyone in New England who still wishes for two weeks off in a winter wonderland!"
3,Over Priced,"I don't think this book was worth the price. Very little in the way of text that was substantive, and had a lot of poor quality photos instead. Having this storm as a monumental time in our lives as a family, I had hoped that there would be more to the book covering the entire storm from the southeastern US to the Maritimes."
3,Not the Woodiwiss I remember,"Maybe my memory is just fading with age, but I remember Kathleen Woodiwiss' books having much more passion and excitement than this one. Going back 20 or so years ago, Woodiwiss and Rosemary Rogers were my favorite historical romance writers. The hardback book was over 500 pages. I enjoyed about the first 350 pages but then I just couldn't wait to finish it. I bought it while on vacation as a used library edition for $1.75. Since it was no big investment, I left it in the hotel for the maid. I was disappointed in this book. I think I'll re-read by favorite Woodiwiss, Shanna."
2,Oh Dear,"I gave this novel the old college try, but it just wasn't working for me. Why, I'm not sure. The writing was too thick instead of being narrative. I did give this two stars for being set in Russia--it always seems like everything is set in England. I made note of the reviewer from Russia and the reviewer who also made note of the Russian reviewer. Myself I haven't studied much about Russia, but I did think the names were rather odd. Really, if you're going to the trouble of writing a huge novel, what does it take to spend a day or two in the library researching yourself?"
5,the flame and the flower,"This is probably one of the best books I've ever read. I totaly fell in love with the characters Brandon and Heather, and the way the author describes the passion they shared. I honestly wish that there is more of the old time romance in our life now, that would make life more beautiful. So if you're in search for a little bit of passion that is lacking in your life, read the book. I truly recommend it to everyone who wants to learn about the purity of love."
3,A Bit of a Disappointment,"The first Woodiwiss novel that I read was The Elusive Flame. I quickly became a fan, but I was disappointed in this one. Much like Ashes in the Wind, this book dragged on and on. I found myself skimming ahead to try to find something more exciting. If you can endure it, the book does end on a positive note. I love so many of her others, that I was a little let down by this one."
2,very disappointed,short and sweet. i totally agree with the lady from elliott city. kathleen woodiwiss has lost her touch. her early books started me reading romances. the flame and the flower is one of my all time favourites. this latest books confirms i will not be purchasing any further of her books. i guess it is time for her to retire or change genres.
4,Throughly enjoyed it,"I throughly enjoyed this book. So why only four stars? It started out rather slow for me and it took me a while to get into it, but once I did I couldn't put it down."
4,Forever in Your Embrace,"I found the story to be very enjoyable. I was so excited in the beginning, and then it fell quiet for a while. But not for long. The high drama and action mixed with the confusion, anger, and love combines to make an enthrawling book."
1,A very standard romance book,"I found this book very standard...there is nothing outstanding or special with the plot nor the character of this book. I found myself very amused how the heroine in this book was portrayed and how she was placed in situation where all these men just want to kidnap her and somehow bed her. That is what I get mostly got out of this book, that Countess Synovea is an object of lust and thus her beauty is her curse...and that Colonel Tyrone just happends to be one of the man who lust after her and in the end loves her...and tries to protect her from all these men who wants to bed her. Try reading authors like Judith McNaught, Julie Garwood, or Sandra Brown for great plot, heartfelt love story, and interesting character."
1,The Worst Kathleen Woodwiss Book Ever,"I have read many Kathleen Woodwiss books and on the most part I enjoy reading them; I even cope with the blah names such as Cerynise because I loved the Elusive Flame; but there is nothing about Forever In Your Embrace that I liked. IT was tedious to read but perservered. First of all the Names Tyrone and Synnovea, Uggghh! Some of the rest weren't even pronounciable. The story was just awful and I guarantee if this was the first book I would have ever read of hers I would not have read anymore; SAVE YOUR MONEY OR IF YOU FEEL COMPELLED TO READ IT GO TO THE LIBRARY."
4,a bit of a let-down,"I've become a recent, enthusiastic fan of Ms. Woodweiss because of her eloquence in her writings and the romance she portrays. Although not exactly dissappointed in this one, I was somewhat expecting more. Call me strange, but the plot seemed too tame. The heroine gets lusted over by many men, is forced to marry one in particular, they go through a misunderstanding, then fall passionately in love and defeat their opposers. yep. that's about it."
2,You might want to pass this one up.,"Sorry, but I am agreeing with several of the other reviews who don't seem to care for this book too much. I got lost in the detail. I questioned the names, and the bathhouse seemed to be the most popular of places in this book. I loved the idea of the setting being Russia instead of England. I have always enjoyed Woodwiss books but this is definitely not my favorite."
1,About 400 pages too long,"I really liked Petals on the River, and for that reason picked up this title by the same author. When I found myself laid-up for 2 months in bed with a herniated disk in my neck, I tried to distract myself from the pain by reading something engrossing. I thought this would be the perfect solution. Really though, it was unbelievably tedious. I love historical novels, and romance all the better. The characters could have carried me away, but I agree with others that it dragged on and on and by the time I read for the 1000-th time how lovely Synnovea's creamy skin or gorgeous dress was, I wanted to scream. I began to wonder which was more painful--finishing this book, or my own neck. My recommendation: don't bother. Get a good Nora Roberts and a cup of tea by the fire."
2,I wish Kathleen could have made the girl better,I am only on half way though but I am contemplating whether or not to finish the book. I really have no interest in finishing the book. I think the girl is a little stupid. The beginning introduce the girl as someone compassionate and maybe strong. She was taught to be free and think for herself. But so far I am disgusted about the way she has been while under the guardianship of the princess. I really hope she improves so I can finish the book without wasting my time.
3,too soft to be hard,The book arrived in the condition described except that it was a trade paperback instead of a hardcover.It was timely delivery (2-3 weeks).
4,A true attention grabber,I personally enjoyed Halfway Man immensly. The style Drew used by telling the story in circles with no specific order was intriguing. The author is descriptive to a point that readers truely feel like they know the chacters and breath the same northern air. Overall I'm glad I got the chance to read this novel in English class and would recommend it to others. Drew is an amazing author and I am proud to say he is Canadian.
4,Halfway Man,"I am in grade eleven and have just read Halfway Man for english. I found it a very insightful book, and I learned a lot about life in general by reading it. I could relate in many ways to it. I think it has a variety of important themes that we should pay more attention to. This book has a powerful message, and I would strongly reccomend it to everyone. Jennifer Salmon"
1,Died in less than a week.,"Wouldn't buy this again. Lasted less than a week before dying on me. Amazon informs me I need to put at least twenty words into this review, so OK, it was shorter than one week before it died. Maybe that's clear and long enough."
1,only one word for this movie: STUPID! deserves NO STAR!!!!,"WHAT A PATHETIC MOVIE! bad script, bad acting, bad directing, bad editing, bad background music....everything is bad, bad and, BAD!one of the worst movies ever seen. unlikable actors and actress, brain-dead script, stupid scenario, an ultimate insult to viewers over age of 13. i just don't want to waste more time in giving this review. what a junk!"
3,Just Plain Good Old Family Entertainment,"If you are looking for good family entertainment, keeping your expections low, I think you will have a good movie to spend time with your kids."
1,Just watch a preview - that's all there is,"I managed to watch 18 minutes before switching to 16x fast forward. Not fast enough. One of the most pointless movies ever, and a waste of good filmstock and a couple of otherwise decent actors."
2,Can't recommend this,"Sometimes ""bad"" movies strike me as fun to watch at least once, but I really disliked this. It isn't so bad that it deserves a 1-star in my view, but it is rather trite and not really funny when it tries to be comedic."
2,"Low budget, bad acting, no worries movie",I just rented this movie and to tell you the truth-I could barely sit thru it--the acting is terrible-many mistakes-the props are really-- I mean really fake and easy to catch. It tried to be too much like Romancing the Stone but falls way short with the obvious low budget they had for this film. I guess they made it to make a bundle on DVD rental income-The outtakes in a lot of instances should have been left in and the alternate ending should have been the original ending. With these scenes added it might have been a somewhat decent movie. In its current state its hard to sit thru except for the beautiful lead actress. Stay away if you dare--you might save some money------
3,Good movie for a rainy day,"This is a great movie for a rainy day. It has action,romance,comedy,and drama. The pace of the movie is perfect. It keeps going with no low points. Clayton and Kristin are perfectly casted in their parts. If you like a movie you don't have to think while watching, this is it."
1,This is a comedy not a drama,"Couldn't finish it, lasted 20 minutes and turned it off before any of the special cgi effects. Tries to be a ""Romancing the Stone"" comedy/drama but fails with poor acting and lack of humor. The cover led me to believe it might ""Missing"" type of drama that Lemon starred in with South American rebels and a missing person as they tried to locate, etc. Nothing of the sort here."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I bought this juicer specifically for use as a bar tool, and it saw intermittent use on lemons (and only lemons) for about three months. While it did a decent job of extracting juice, the lever itself was balky, suggesting to me that the internal gear assembly isn't machined to particularly high tolerances. Furthermore, the spout is positioned EXTREMELY low: you can get a jigger/pony underneath it, but anything larger is an adventure. Finally, the ""stem"" isn't manufactured well: it had started to bend, thus degrading the performance of the gears even further, and when I tried to bend it back into shape with some gentle pressure, it actually snapped apart, destroying the juicer entirely.Save your $30."
1,"looks good, lousy performer","I had this item for approximately three weeks and it was broken by the fourth time I used it. The base opening is an awkward size making it hard to find a glass/cup to fit. The mechanism was not strong enough to withstand the force needed to extract the juice. As a result, the neck bent and after reshaping it a few times, it snapped in half. Their return policy is good but it is better to buy a different juicer all-together. The design is attractive. If they would use a stronger alloy and redesign the opening then they might warrant the $30."
3,Maybe too mini,"This is an attractive machine, however, it does not come with a container or cup to catch the juice. The stand is so small and short, good luck finding a cup or container to fit under it successfully."
1,PLEASE READ and save your money,"Although, this product appears well constructed and made of stainless steel it's crap. It's too small to fit even half an orange. And the amount of juice extracted is less than that by hand-squeezing. Trust me I compared the two. I read the reviews and still bought and now it's sitting in the bottom of my trash. I couldn't in good consciousness even resel it on eBay. In summary, don't buy use your hand for better results."
4,Its reminds me a when I was at JOTC in Panama....,"I saw this books at a local book store and started to thumb through it. I was amazaed how quickly I was transformed from my current life to 15 years ago when I was in the 82nd Airborne Division attending the Jungle Operations Training Center in Ft. Sherman Panama. Much of the training was absolutely different than that of Ft. Benning infantry school or anything at ft. Bragg outside of the 18th Airborne Corps RECONDO school. This book deals with small until tactics, movement to contact, actions at the objective that no other book has. A really good read as well....."
4,"a lesson to ""unlearn""","I had to read this book at work (I'm an assistant editor for a teachers' magazine) and was pleasantly surprised at the outcome of my reading assignment. If you are a parent or teacher, you will have no trouble finding some benefit from this book.""Hate Hurts"" addresses issues that different ages of children have, from a preschooler's inquiries (""Why don't that man's legs work?"") to more serious teen-age deliberations (""I don't like how my friends were teasing that gay guy, but I don't want them to think I'm gay..."").The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is the scattershot approach the book takes. Having said that, this approach makes the book digestible by parents and teachers alike, and the material is appropriate for sharing with nearly anybody. This book is an easy read, and has many applicable anecdotes and a great lesson for all."
1,Junk.,"They are useless; there is nothing anti-gravity about them. They are just big, clumsy shoes. The comment about the size being wrong is an outright lie. We bought them in two different sizes, and had many family members of varying weights try them. They simply do not work."
4,Worth the Trip,"After the great first edition of Trip Do Brasil, the sequel, V.2, will again get everybody addicted who likes Brasilian-style vibes mixed eletronically. This one is jazzier and worth a front space in your record shelf (maybe right next to V.1)."
2,Fine convection oven and burner of toast,"I've been using this ""toaster"" convection oven for well over a year now and can say without hesitation that this will NOT function well as a toaster. If you need a small oven to function as an oven this will work great. The convection function (air flow) helps with that.Like all ""toaster"" ovens in this class, the problem is primarily the egg timer. That's all it is. It's a mechanical timer that has to be twisted enough to go through its full cycle (to zero and then ding). If you don't do that the oven shuts off and never reaches the end of the timer. Problem is, you end up burning your toast. A LOT. This toaster has sent more slices of bread to their grave than I can count.My recommendation: Don't get ANY toaster oven unless it is an electric timer that precisely measures the cooking time. These egg timer models are worthless as toasters."
1,"Worst ""toaster"" ""oven"" ever!","About a couple of weeks after buying this toaster oven the convection fan started to rattle when in use. And not a low subtle rattle either - it was very loud. Then soon after, the door started to rattle due to the vibration the convection fan made when it rattled. I had to put a spoon in the door to at least prevent one of the noises while using the oven. The oven never really toasted at all and barely cooked very well. The elements never got red and so the broil never worked either. I couldn't wait to get rid of this toaster oven and now have a better one that actually functions."
4,Totally pleased,"After going through a LOT of toaster ovens over the years..(they only seem to last about 1 to 2 years)..I opted to try a small convection type. I did not expect this to be comparable to a full-fledged convection oven, but I was extremely pleased with its operation. I use the toaster oven every day for almost everything and I will say it works as well if not better than any I have ever owned.I was a little leery of the 1200 watt rating, but with the fan, it cooks as well as a 1500 watt oven...maybe better. I have only had this for a short time, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone...even a ""first-time"" toaster oven buyer. The under $40.00 sale price was another incentive...I definitely got my moneys worth."
2,Had to Return,"I bought this oven 3 weeks ago. After using it once, the door would not close so I exchanged it for the identical model. I had it for two weeks when the fan started rattling. Sometimes I wasn't even sure if the heating elements were working properly since I NEVER saw the bottom ones light up even though I tried various cooking settings. Also, the racks do not slide in and out easily which is annoying if you are dealing with hot food and you are struggling to pull out the rack. So, I have returned this item, once again, and have asked for my money back. I'm going to try Oster this time around. Maybe it will do the trick."
5,History that Reads Like Fiction,"""Mr. Roosevelt's Steamboat"" describes the first steamboat journey on the Mississippi. It reads like a fast-paced novel yet it is scrupulously accurate history thanks to the thorough research done by the gifted Ms. Dohan. The three-month voyage starts in Pittsburgh in 1811 and is an exciting adventure for Nicholas and Lydia Roosevelt and their two children--the second born enroute. (Nicholas was Theodore Roosevelt's great-granduncle.) Roosevelt believed in his boat and risked everything to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of steam transportation on the Mississippi. The adventure-packed voyage includes passages through dangerous falls, a chase by Indians, the New Madrid earthquake and an on-board fire. This excellently written book is a must for those who like true-action with their history."
4,rock,"rock. i got this cd for no particular reason, but it ROCKS. the singing is like old new found glory but better....the drums are fantastic and theyre the kinda songs that change direction fifty times in 3 or 4 mins...its all good. check out young brash hopeful and whatever it takes to get a vague idea of what ur getting...and imagine it fifty times as rockin.... yeh its good alright."
3,"Great, but it breaks.","My mother bought me one of these for Christmas, and the second time I used it, it split open in the freezer. I liked the idea, and the way it made my beer very very cold, even slushy! I bought 2 more, and one has already cracked. Maybe my freezer is too cold, but in my mind there shouldn't be a residential freezer too cold. When they are full of beer they are awesome, but when they crack in the freezer they are much much less than awesome. GO COUGS!!!!"
3,The chair I received was good.,"The chair is nice. It is well built and fits well. It has good construction. I originally ordered 3 of them. 1 arrived, 2 were recieved as I was told they had been ""damaged in shipment"". I reordered the two, one was shipped, and it was ""damaged in shipment"". Funny, the fulfillment center is only 20 miles away.If you order these, good luck."
4,Good Quality Chair,"I bought four very similar counter-height chairs at another online retailer. These chairs look exactly the same with the exception of different scroll work (which I think does look nicer) on the back. The description sounds the same. They were called Beau Swivel Stools and I got them for less than $100 each. So you may want to check them out if price is a factor. They are also available on amazon.com:Beau 24"" Swivel Counter StoolThese were easy to put together despite the poor instructions. The swivel function works well and the chairs are very heavy. One word of caution is that if you put them near a wall or other structure, it will get damaged by the back of the scrolled tops on the chair that are made of thick steel."
3,"small light, very bright","This is indeed a very bright light and quite small, but I feel a bit cheated by how it was shipped. Payed over $5 shipping and recieved the light in a paper thin box enclosed in a bubble wrap envelope with 3 stamps on it, which was crushed. Since I only used it for a moment then wrapped it as a present I can't validate the claims others have mentioned, but they do seem viable. If I had it to do over again I probably would have gone another direction."
1,You get what you pay for...,Its a cheap flashlight for a cheap price. It does work but the button mechanism has just gotten worse and worse. Very poor quality...MUCH better flashlights out there.
2,Not what's pictured,"The item I received was not what was pictured and is a far cry from what I expected. I owned one of the original Special Forces flashlights sold at the CVS pharmacy chain and it was outstanding. I was looking to replace the unit that was lost by my child. The picture used by this seller is the same as what was sold at CVS, but the product is different in design and the quality is sub-par.I advise the seller to use a true visual repesentation of their product as this is not it."
1,...buy something else,Got one of these for my birthday and it will not stay on. The toggle button on the bottom has to be held in for it to work. Took it back to the place it was purchased and every single one on the shelf was either busted or didnt work at all. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and get a real flash light.
1,Cheap garbage,"This light is bright, and it uses normal batteries. Those are the only good factors. The middle led sticks out too far for it to sit on a table face down without wobbling. The tolerances of the seals are poor meaning that it leaks when submersed and causing the switch to be not needed. (if you screw the cap down close to when it comes on, all you need to do is press the end cap and the play in the threads acts as the switch. I've collected flashlights for many years and this one is not worth your respect."
2,Pathetic packaging,"My two flashlights do work, but they didn't at first, until I adjusted the battery springs. They came in a flimsy envelope with no inside packaging, and each flashlight was in a thin cardboard box--one box had split open in transit. After paying $10.98 for shipping and handling, I see that the sender paid only 87 cents postage. I'm not a happy camper."
2,Confused...,"We have two, and 50% is not bad for gambling, but we sure thought they'd both work, but one absolutely will not turn on. The button on the end does not toggle the light on and off, so what's the point? Avoid the hassle, go with a different product. I hope the other lady enjoys this thing in her purse, turning on and off when she least expects it! The batteries will drain for sure in a backpack. It's only redemtive quality is that it is fairly bright."
1,You get what you pay for,"This is a cheap flash light. It is bright, but the led bulbs burn out quickly. It is not water proof, it has no seals. The contact spring is extremely flimsy and you will have to find a way to keep the batteries touching the contacts. I had to use two nickels and it makes it quite heavy for its size. When the batteries start to die (after a short period) the flash light will turn off intermittently. Spend a couple more dollars and get something you will use."
3,"Bright, but lack of working toggle is annoying","The flashlight is very bright. That was what I was looking for. Like one of the other reviewers, I need to keep the toggle switch pressed to keep the light on...or I can screw the base tighter and that will keep it on. To turn it off, unscrew the base a litte. Horrible design, or faulty switch. Either way, it makes it unpleasant to use."
1,You Must Be Kidding!,"This book is not worth the money. It is full of hypocrisy. And, the recommendation by Jim Madden isn't worth a wooden nickel. Jim's company EXULT is and has been instrumental in the outsourcing of US jobs, having outsourced Bank of America's HR personnel in 2000 and Prudential HR personnel in 2002. How's that for treating people right? Think for yourself - and if you can you don't need this book."
1,LOL,"Don't know whether it's just my dog, but Pet-Ease did nothing, repeat nothing for calming my 13yr old Lab's separation anxiety.....she literally bent the bars of the wire kennel, a la Popeye, and escaped one day I was at work."
5,Muy Bueno,"La verdad me gusta mucho la musica de este artista, y la verdad es lo que yo me esperaba..esta muy bueno"
1,Mr Pennsylvania,"gotta agree with you there. we didn't know who this Haddaway person was either. whoever he is, he's best left in the early nineties."
4,A Western that Deals with Spiritual Values,"Deals with the trials and tribulations of hardship in growing up; friendship experienced by a group of men who seemed to have little in common; the fears, desires, and attitudes of individuals who love the West and all the strength and beauty it represents. Cowboys and westerns are what we ""baby boomers"" grew up with each Saturday afternoon matinee. It is a wholesome story about men of various ages, their inter-relationships in adjusting to life. I recommend it for men and women alike who enjoy reading about life in earlier times in the western part of the United States. I also recommend it for young people (middle school and high school) for learning about different lifestyles and Christian values and influences on growing up."
3,Not as shocking as it thinks it is,"Apparently the film-maker thinks he is pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable to put in a movie, but (most) of the scenes in the film have been done better elsewhere. A great deal of the film simply consists of shots of a graveyard, shots of Jesus statues, more shots of tombstones, some meaningless dialog, and then some more dumb footage of something or other. The acting was better than to be expected, and of course the highly unexpected (and highly un-titilating) broom-handle insertion scene is kind of shocking, but on the whole after watching it I kind of wanted to spit on the director and piss on this DVD for wasting my time."
1,Unwatchable,"This sexploitation/revenge ""homemade video"" might have at least a bit of campy appeal if it were really made in 1974. But no, this is a 2001 job and has no value at all. It's not scary. It's not funny. It's not sexy (though it is explicitly sadistic enough to fall in the category of pornography; I'm surprised Amazon even sells it). The acting and production values are atrocious. It's a miserable mess. I fast forwarded through most of it until finally I gave up on it. Simply unwatchable."
1,How can anyone like this movie?,"About the only thing I can say that is good about this movie is that it is not hollywood, but really who cares? This is not a horror movie. In fact all it is is a cheap porn/snuff film that is pathetic because there wasn't even a good sex scene. It was not scary, it was not sexy, it did not shock me. I knew what was going to happen in every scene. Some scenes were drawn out for too long. In reality this movie could be made in one day, thats how stupid it was. PLEASE DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! It was a waste of time. I ended up fastforwarding through the whole thing. Maybe a little too much crystal meth and marajuana was involved in the making of the film and the proceeds should go to rehabilitation and incarceration of the creators of this movie. I believe that anyone who has any intelligence will agree...."
1,Bad DVD,"This DVD I purchased has a few chapters that has NO sound. I sent a message to the seller & have not heard back from them. It starts out playing fine, but if you hit fast forward, when you stop it to play, you have NO sound what so ever. I believe it would be a fairly good movie if you could just hear all of it.I Spit on Your Corpse, I Piss on Your Grave: Official Director's Version"
3,I spit on your corpse I piss on your grave,"Sexually explicit and violent film made last year on a minute budget, very graphic in places.Its about a women who gets sexually abused by about three or four men and then disposes of them in a vairitey of gruesome ways,While getting sexual kicks out of it.If you like shocks this film is for you.Film runs for about 73 mins and has behind the scenes footage and an interview with the director and a wealth of other goodies."
4,Well-made gore and sex movie!,"Wow! If you are into 70's style horror and revenge movies, you will like this movie a lot! Compared to the cool old, scratchy, grainy shockers of the 70's, I Spit On Your Corpse, I Piss On Your Grave has much better acting and visuals. Also, the violence is MUCH more graphic and disturbing. But even with these ""updates"" Spit On Your Corpse still has that 70's exploitation edge that you feel in films like the Ilsa series, or the original I Spit On Your Grave. In spots, the acting falters, and sometimes the visuals are a bit too odd and abstract for my taste, but overall, Spit On Your Corpse is a very cool, well-directed exploitation movie! WARNING: The gore and sex are VERY extreme! If you get offended by that kind of stuff, DO NOT watch this movie!"
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!,"I rented (thank God) This film thinking it would be a decent remake of ""I Spit on Your Grave"" Which was a fair B movie at best. But from the very begining of this film you just want it to GET ON WITH IT!! If it were not for the Long drawn out scenes the thing woulnt even be 74 min long I think there is about 20 mins long. The only good thing about this move is the crystal clarity of the actual picture..Too bad the leading lady is about as attractive as pig swill. Dont waste your time or money on this STINKER."
4,I'm luvin it!,D-A-M-N people really hated this film. I LOVED IT! One of my favorites to date. Emily Haack is super hot! The haters on here can only wish they were half as attractive as her. I loved the broomstick in the p*ssy scene! Can honestly say that surprised me and I have never seen anything like that in a film...AND I watch a lot of films of this nature. It has no association with I Spit On Your Grave but is just as enjoyable. The girl on the DVD cover is not in the film like most people on here have stated but then again I never judge a book by the cover. That tidbit seems to have really bothered some folks. I'd check it out if you like early John Waters or Russ Meyers stuff.
1,A disappointment!!,I was very disapponted with this product. Only the cover is from the original album from the sixties. I had the vinil and was expecting to have the same songs in CD. Only 2 ou 3 songs were from the original songtrack! Frustrating!!!
4,Classics Nasciemento,great record - even has Pat Metheny on it. Heard it's coming out from a US label in July and he's touring in the fall. If you dig the Brasilian thing this one's very cool.
5,Milton scores again,"Hauntingly beautiful, technically dazzling, pure joy from Brazil.This album should be investigated by John Ashcroft as it is the most addictive offering from Milton since 'Nascimento'. The second tune, casa alberta, is as good as anything Milton has ever done, and that's saying a lot!Bottom line: This one hasn't come out of my CD player since the day I put it in."
1,"Bad Valve Stem for 12-1/2""","These tubes are nearly impossible to accidentally puncture, but they fail in the 12-1/2 x 2-1/4"" size because the stems are straight rubber. I tried to use them on a Trikke 12, and all of the stems tore after multiple refillings, since they have to be bent outward to attach a pump. What good is an indestructable tube with fragile valve stem?"
5,WOW!,This is my favorite CD in my collection. Her voice just takes you away. Her strong vocals on Possesion and Elsewhere takes you on another plane. Sometimes it seems so overwhelming. Ice Cream is a fun song you always want to sing when you here it. I never get tired of this CD. It's a must have.
5,voice like a trumpet,"I absolutely love this album. From Possession to Hold On to Ice Cream, each song is so beautifully written. Definitely the best Sarah has out. I listen to it over and over again in the car, never get sick of it."
5,"The Pinnacle of ""Ecstasy""","I first discovered this album in 8th grade, when I listened to it at least 3 times a day (hey, junior high can be tough! :). 10 years later, I still feel that FTE represents the absolute BEST of Sarah's work. Her beautiful, haunting melodies coupled with intensely raw lyrics really capture the range of human emotion. This is far better than any of her preceding or subsequent works; Surfacing can't touch it with a ten-foot pole. For example, ""I Love You"" on the Surfacing album seems so clumsy when compared to the skillful artistry behind such FTE songs as the exuberantly playful ""Ice Cream."" ""Ice,"" as the other reviewers mentioned, is one of the most incredible songs from the album. If you buy just one Sarah album, this is absolutely the one to get.(By the way, I haven't purchased Afterglow yet, so I can't compare it to FTE. I do like ""Fallen"" quite a lot, just from hearing it on the radio.)"
5,Genius,"Sarah McLachlan has a voice that is simply beautiful and angelic. Out of all the female performers out there, I think her voice is by far the best one (just my opinion). She also has a remarkable songwriting ability. Of all her albums, this one is definitely my favorite one. Every song on here stands out on their own. It's hard to pick a favorite song, they're all equally as good, but I believe I'd have to say the title track and the piano/vocal version of ""Possession"" (the hidden track) are tied as my favorite. Also one of my faves is one that I think is quite overlooked, which is ""Wait'. All of my aqcuaintances don't really dig it, but I think it's great. The whole album is just brilliant. It's not full of anger, just some music to soothe your soul. I'd really like a new album to come out soon, I'm in suspense to hear some fresh material. Also check out the collaboration she has done with Delerium (""Silence""), it's just as good, whether you like dance music or not."
5,"Great deal, great service!",I always shop Amazon for good deals in used and new cd's and dvd's. This time was no exception. Incredible price for an album that is not very common. I bought mine to replace my original copy. I love my cd's to be in its original case and this seller really live up to it's promises. Thanks!
5,An absolutely fantastic CD,"Probably the best CD I've ever heard. Lyrical, harmonic, full of feeling and fun. I have all of her other CD's, and they're all very good, but there is something really special about this one. Do yourself a favour and spring for this one. It's fantastic, simply an amazing event."
5,This one is the best!,"If you only want one of Sara's Cd's, this is it! I play it endlessly while driving and never tire of it.An absolute masterpiece! Not a bad song on it."
4,She Definitely Didn't Fumble,This is the second Sarah cd that I bought. I wasn't sure if I was gonna like it but I was hooked and madly in love after I heard it from start to finish. I can't sit here and list individual songs as best ones because they are all SO GREAT that I couldn't believe it. I'm glad that I got this cd because to not have it is to seriously do damage to your cd collection - this cd is a must have.
2,not her best c.d.,She has put out better music than this. I was disappointed with most of the tracks it didnt hold my interest. One or two good songs .
2,Surfacing-lovers steer clear of this one!,"Having fallen for Sarahs sublime Surfacing cd I reckoned her previous one ought to be equally fabulous. Well, guess again: it is not. It's all just too hermetic and too girly... too complex and too would-be. Lets face it: we love Sarahs music because it's so simple, so genuine, so unconstructed and self-evident. So what's with these weird arrangements? I much much much prefer the versions she did on The Freedom Sessions. Then, finally, you get to hear just how beautiful a song Mary is, or how lovely Ice Cream can sound, and how beautiful Good Enough and Hold On really are. I am soooo glad she put things right with Surfacing!!!"
5,The Best,"I am not a huge fan of Ms. McLachlan in general, but ""Fumbling"" is definitely her standout work. I first heard it in 1994 and 10 years later I still play it. The songs never seem to get old. She sold out once the big Lilith Fair media hype hit a while back. But I'm telling you, if you are into well-crafted songs and singer/songwriter types, purchase this cd in particular."
5,An special song from Sara.,Hy :I'm looking for an special song of Mrs Mc.La..It talks about God and it's singed by Jim Carrey in his last picture. Can any one tell me the name of the Album/song in order to buy it ??Thank you very much.Gregorio
4,Not her best,"So much hype about how good ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy"" is made me put it away and only listen to some songs. The album is great, but I've never been able to listen to it all together. Stand-out tracks are ""Hold On"", ""Fear"", and my favorite Sarah song ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy."" I just find that ""Solace"" and ""Surfacing"" are much better."
3,Surfacing is Better....,"I have to admit, I bought this album after buying ""Surfacing"", and I just think she's getting better. The only song I really love is ""Possession"" on this album. She does have quite a voice and writes great lyrics."
5,Totally awesome!,"Okay, i will admit that I did not like this cd at first because i thought it was too slow. My ex-girlfriend introduced me to it. After we broke up I heard ""Possession"" on the radio and it brought back so many memories. After that day I bought it and it has become one of my most favorite cds of all time! I mean ""Possession"" is a brilliant song that just puts you in this trance where nothing else in the world matters. And great songs like ""Elsewhere"" and the hope inspiring ""Hold On"" are jusin al league of their own. In a summary...i say that anyone is a fool not to have this wonderful piece of artistry!"
5,raw yet polished,"this album is the mark of an artist who has mastered both writing and producing music. though she still had her trademark ""mclachlan rawness"", her voice and lyrics exuded a sort of defiant confidence without sounding cocky (read: oasis). in the way that surfacing is polished and another step in her unimaginable development, ""FTE"" shows us the sarah that attains musical ecstasy without fumbles"
2,Cheesy,"Sarah has a pretty voice, but I just find this music sort of cheesy -- the kind of lush, overly deliberate beauty that reminds me of relaxation tapes of Pachelbel's Canon in D set against ocean sounds, with high school poetry lyrics. It's stuff like ""If I shed a tear, I won't cage it, I won't fear love!"" and ""Morning smiles the face of a newborn child, innocent, unknowing."" Yuck. I don't know; I say if you want to hear a genuinely beautiful female singer/songwriter, go for something like Patty Griffin."
2,Don't waste your money,"would have given it one star but I think I've heard one or two worse singers than Sarah McLachlin. Her songs are not insightful, she has a raspy voice (why do people like this?) and she doesn't seem like a very nice person. It's not the worst cd I have, but there are SO many better singers out there, why waste money on this one? I suppose I have to admire what she has done with Lilith Fair, although there are many other women working just as hard as her, and just don't get recognized. I do like one or two of her songs, but even they become way overplayed and boring after awhile. I wouldn't waste my time or money on this cd... but then again I could name worse ones."
3,Not my favorite,I adore Sarah McLachlan - but I didn't really enjoy this one. I found it too heavy - no song stands on its own......
2,Pass this one by,"Sarah McLachlan has a few good songs, but not one single one is on this CD. I don't understand why some people gave it 5 stars. The songs aren't terrible, but there weren't any songs that got my interest. I guess that's why there are so many used copies of this CD for sale."
4,Very Strong Album,"This is really good, strong album. Unlike some CDs where there are only one or two really great songs, the majority of the songs on here are good. This CD is well worth the money."
4,Great Combination,"The video documentary disc is the real jewel in this 3-pack. I gifted this set so I don't recall if the Freedom Sessions disc included all the rom-interactive features like the copy I bought singly back in the 1990's. Nevertheless, the Freedom song versions are just one more way to enjoy a landmark collection of great tunes."
5,Absolutely breathtaking,"When I first fell in love with Sarah McLachlan's music after buying Surfacing, I was told that Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is a must for all her fans. And now two years later, I have to agree.The style is completely different than on Surfacing, with slower rhythms sung in a softer voice, which makes it all the more beautful. If you liked Surfacing, you will love this.I treasure this album, I listen to it at least twice a day, whenever I have a moment's spare time...like when I'm reading, taking a bath, or even making dinner. The song that haunts me the most is ""Fear"", and each time I listen to it I get chills down my spine.I recommend this CD to anyone and everyone who wants to find tranquil serenity wrapped in a sultry, heavenly voice."
5,One word to describe it: EXCELLENT,"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is one of her best albums. EXCELLECT album - with songs like ""Possession"", ""Good Enough"", ""Elsewhere"", ""Ice Cream"", ""Fear"", and ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy"" - these and all the rest make up a beautiful album lyrically and artistically."
5,a saviour,this album brought me out of the lowest depression i've ever been in. i really don't know where i'd be without it. i am convinced that sarah mclachlan is the reason my love for music sparked once more
2,Where's Lauper when you need her!!??!!,"Man, I'm all for deep introspection, but this chick takes the cake!! Talk about a dull, uninspired recording! The only song worth anything on this record is the first one, the beautiful ""Possession."" After that, however, it's Sleep City - BIGTIME!!To be fair, Sarah M. writes ethereal, piano-sprinkled tunes that can strike a nerve every so often. Plus, her lyrics are indeed heartfelt, and for that I commend her. Nonetheless, whatever happened to Lauper's famous motto: ""Girls just wanna' have fun!"" Sarah M. seems to be just the opposite: ""Girls just wanna have depression!""Well, at any rate, it's better than April Lavigne or Nickelback.PEACE 'EM UP!!"
1,Fecus,"From start to finish this album is an amorphous blob of wishy-washy sound. The lyrics seem like they should have a strong, assured message, but end up being nebulous and fakey. The only thing this cd is good for is a coaster."
5,"Longevity, personal, and perfect","I have own this CD since 1994(?) and it is still in my CD player. In fact, I think I'm on my 6th copy because every time I lend it, I never get it back. Too bad I don't remember who borrows it.Sarah's best work and far superior to her other albums. If there's a perfect CD, this is it. This album is meant to be experience in its entirety and not with only certain songs."
4,one of sarah's best,"a beautiful cd. i especially recommend ""possession,"" ""ice cream,"" & just about every other song."
4,Good Enough,My favorite of Sarah's albums is Surfacing but one of my two favorite songs by her is on Fumbling. It's the incredibly beautiful song Good Enough. My other favorite is I Love You on Surfacing. If you like Sarah and you haven't heard Good Enough it's worth the price of the CD. It's one of the best songs you'll ever hear.
5,NICE!!!!,"I enjoy this album this is a nice album I really do like this album itcontains some of Aretha's hit from the 80's thru 1994.I think that it is a very nice album and it contains some nice songs. It contains Jump to it, Jimmy Lee, Get it Right, I Knew You Were Waiting For Me, Who's Zooming Who, Freeway of Love, Everchanging Times, and manymore great songs I would reccomend this album to any Aretha Franklin fan you would definitely enjoy this album..."
3,Aretha does pop music,"If you liked Aretha's foray into 80's pop music, then you'll like this set. Who's Zoomin' Who, Another Night, Jimmy Lee, and I Knew You Were Waiting For Me are all fun songs that don't get played on the radio any more. There were a few songs here I could have done without (Willing to Forgive, United Together, Honey), but they fit the mode of the rest of the album well. This collection really shows you how Aretha can adapt to the times."
1,No jumpin' jack flash,I bought this cd for getting 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' no 16 on the list stated on this page. But it's not there. I have all the other songs....! What a waste!Apparantly you have to buy the import version of this cd to get track 16.Amazon should correct this!!!!!
4,Almost all of her new Best!,"First off: rated 4 and not 5 stars because she did not include any song from the THROUGH THE STORM cd.Second off: it is spectacular look back at this 14 years of hits and go WOAH!Aretha recorded two new tracks for this package, both written and produced by Babyface: HONEY is very very very black and Aretha pours her all into it.WILLING TO FORGIVE is a winner, big R'n'B ballad. I like everything about it.A DEEPER LOVE comes from the SISTER ACT II soundtrack, it is produced by Clivilles/Cole and catapultes Ms. Ree in the dance arena of the '90's...Plus you get almost all of the hits she scored throughout this spawn of time, including the # 1 duet with George Michael I KNEW YOU WERE WAITING FOR ME, the Rolling Stones written and produced JUMPIN' JACK FLASH, the torch ballad for excellence JIMMY LEE...You will be impressed by the diverse material included!"
5,Excellent view from a different perspective,"I found Bishop Foster's book while searching Las Vegas wedding sites. Her unique frame of reference of her many weddings performed in Las Vegas was as touching as it was humorous. My fiance and I planned our wedding using some of the information from the wedding ceremonies in the back of the book. It was a most beautiful day! I highly recommend Bishop Foster's unique ""Chicken soup"" type of book to those who think that Las Vegas is only ""smoke and mirrors."""
1,Ready back label....,It says THIS ITEM IS NOT FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE! And to be honest it s kinda expensive for a tiny little bottle...doesn't have any scent....
4,Clinique Face Spray,this was my fist time useing this product and i really liked it. a must have for anyone that wears face powder.
4,"Texas Swing, Jumps!","As a recent fan of the Tractors, I can only say that this CD lived up to my expectations. This is a great example of Texas Swing, and I highly recommend it!"
3,Not Like Today's Dance Music,"If you want to get a great feel for what the middle of the 90's decade had to offer music-wise then you will enjoy this CD. It's not the best dance music that was out at the time, but you get a good feel for what was."
4,You'll know most of these,"A lot of songs you'll know on here. Enjoyed pretty much all of them. Only drawback - these are the radio edits - so you'll get the 4 minute versions of songs, not the extended dance mixes. But you'll get to put a song to an artist/title. Given this is for sales used for pennies - go ahead and get one! :)"
1,I didn't know that amazon sold boot-leg movies,The quality of this movie was very poor. I thought I was buying an original movie and it wasn't. I waited four months for my dvd to come in and the quality of the movie was horrible. I may not ever shop at amazon againYou're Gonna Make Me Love Somebody Else
1,play,I was not satisfied with this product. It seemed like a poor copy. The focus wasn't close or clear. I couldn't enjoy it.
1,Please do not put another play out there.,"I wish I would have read the comments on this movie before I purchased it. The quality was very poor, the volume, the coughing of the camera person. You could bearly make out what any one was saying. This was a rip off. ShellyGarrett should refund very ones money. Buy at your own risk."
1,ALWAYS READ THE REVIEW!!! I WISH I HAD!!!,"I ORDERD THIS PLAY HOPEING IT WOULD BE AS GOOD AS THE LIVE PLAY,BAD MISTAKE THIS PLAY WAS HORRIBLE THE PLAY WAS EXTREMLY DARK,SOUND IS HORRIBLE.I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEW I'M SORRY I CAN'T RETURN THIS PLAY FOR A FULL REFUND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO KEEP. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE."
2,Terrible Quality Product!,"I was amazed at the terrible quality of this dvd. I had to turn the volume on my tv to 32 just to barely hear what the actors were saying, then the loud laughter of the audience almost burst my eardrums! The quality was so terrible you couldn't even clearly see the actors facial features. Everyone's play can't be a Tyler Perry production, but at least when you buy his plays the quality of his dvd's are good. You can clearly see the actors, you can hear what they are saying and you can watch the dvd at normal volume levels. I will probably have to watch this thing at least three times before I can hear what's going on. Wouldn't recommend purchasing this. Shelly Garrett should be ashamed for putting such an inferior product on the market. And it's too bad, the play is probably actually good if you could see it and actually hear what the actors are saying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Another Bad Garrett Play,"Of course Bernadett and Lisa Ray are great actors, but this play needs a tune up. Nothing against anyone gay, but the gay guy and the older lady are overdoing it. It detracts from the play and it's not that funny. This is play 2 of 3 that I could not finish. I always try to support, but this makes it hard."
5,Nancy and friends and an exciting cruise!!,This is vintage Nancy Drew. I got caught up in Nancy's trying to solve a mystery aboard a cruise ship on the Great Lakes. You'll never guess how the fugitive got the diamonds across the Canadian border. Ingenious!!!
5,Diamond Rio's best (and Nashville's best!),"This album is an exercise in pure joy. Every song is excellent, and Diamond Rio's totally unique, bluegrass-fused-with-honky-tonk vocal and instrumental sound makes the recordings jump out of the speakers.Love a Little Stronger is a great upbeat love song, and Finish What We Started is the sonic equivalent of distilled water--crystal clear, no impurities. You Ain't In It, Night Is Fallin' In My Heart (by quirk-master Dennis Linde), and Bubba Hyde are some of Diamond Rio's best subtly humorous songs. Wild Blue Yonder is another beautiful ballad. Down By the Riverside, Gone Out of My Mind (check out Steve Wariner's I Am Ready for another version of this one), and Appalachian Dream / Kentucky Mine are bone-chilling.Diamond Rio has never topped this album, and nothing to come out of Nashville's mainstream since its release has been better--not even anything by Alan Jackson. This is as good as it gets."
5,FLAWLESS DIAMOND,"""Love A Little Stronger"" is an exceptionally fine album. The music, the lyrics, the splendid harmonies make it hard to single out any one song over another. But, I must confess to a couple of ""favorites"" ---- ""Finish What We Started"", ""Down By The Riverside"", ""Wild Blue Yonder,"" the wonderful instrumental ""Appalachian Dream"", and ""Kentucky Mine,"" a tribute to coal miners. All in all this is one of Diamond Rio's best efforts. Truly, a flawless diamond."
5,still the man!,"this is some beautiful carlinhos! sweet, swinging, singing, hard, soft. it's what i've come to expect from this great, beautiful and odd cat! carlinhos is a top player at the top of his game on this cd and there's ABSOLUTELY NO ONE better at this particular type of game at this particular time! buy this cd and enjoy!"
4,"Could be funkier, but still a solid album","In ""Bahia do Mundo,"" Carlinhos does not duplicate the funky party atmosphere he presented in ""Omelete Man,"" but I don't suppose we should expect him to do so. This album is slightly more mature, for lack of a better word, and reflects back upon ""Alfagamabetizado."" If you like the other stuff, you'll be right at home here - with the soul groove of ""Crendice,"" the solid reggae of ""Mess in the Freeway,"" and the killer percussion throughout. Though the album slows down a bit midway and seems to lose momentum, all is redeemed with the wonderfully written and extremely catchy ""Vai Rolar."" Overall, get the other albums first, but if you can find ""Bahio do Mundo"" it won't disappoint. Carlinhos and his strange brew of all things Brazilian and tinges of American pop and rock make for a fine time once again."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I previewed this CD in the store and ended up buying it but now I'm a little disappointed. It's a little lighter and pop-ier and cheezier than I like. I think I like about 50% of the tracks and the rest I have to fastforward through because they're too cheez for me. The first track, 'pegadas na areia' is great but the second 'crendice' is kind of embarrassing to be caught listening to (unless you like R&B). 'Mess in the freeway' is super-cheez but it gets better with 'cavalo da simpatia', 'cearabe' and 'shalom'. I think I would have a hard time recommending this new CD to anyone unless you're a die-hard fan of Carlinhos Brown or you're into that light pop side of Brazilian music. If you're unfamiliar with Carlinhos Brown, check out Alphagamabetizacao instead. That CD rocks!"
4,Carlinhos Brown at his best,"This is a fantastic album for those who love Brazilian music. The early cuts are great especially lagoinha and the rest of the album grows on you. It is not as creative and varied as ALFA, but a must buy for Brown's fans. I would love to see him preform in person."
5,Excellent Product,Product works great for tranferring small files and for loading micro sd storage chips. I am satisfied with the performance.
2,Not for Mac OS10.5 users,"Sandisk MicroSD 2GB (SDSDQ-2048, bulk) & BlueProton USB 2.0 Card Reader Writer---The white non-translucent BlueProton USB reader may work for MacOSX, but it doesn't work for 10.5 and URL for drivers on packaging doesn't exist.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Sandisk MicroSD 2GB (SDSDQ-2048, bulk) & BlueProton USB 2.0 Card Reader Writer (Translucent)---The translucent (orange color) card reader works great for OSX.5!! Would like to purchase a second one."
5,Extremely illuminating commentary!,"For the price, you cannot find a better OT commentary! Actually, you'd probably be hard pressed to find much better period! There is more valuable information contained in this one volume than most commentaries I've seen manage in multiple volumes. Unger's style is moderately technical, yet easily understood by the average reader. His theology is conservative, dispensational, and completely Christ centered. His knowledge of OT history, prophecy, theology and Hebrew is outstanding, and his insights are extremely helpful. Pertinent Scripture references are used liberaly throughout the text, which is VERY useful in helping the reader gain deeper understanding of what the bible is teaching, and how Scripture interprets Scripture. Unger was very skilled in illuminating how the Old Testament ties into the New. This commentary has breathed new life into my growing appreciation for the Old Testament!"
1,Typology Run Amock,"I picked up this work 25 years ago and was startled that nearly every pericope in the OT was ignored for its own historical/theological/ethical value and reduced to an at-times questionable typological exercise. Though I agree that Christian interpretation of the OT must be informed by what we know from the NT, this approach completely misses the original point of the writings which have value in themselves."
3,Shakespeare must be spinning,"Billed as a modern telling of The Tempest, Nunez hasn't even come close.This book will give you nightmares and/or ruin your plans to cruise the West Indies, or the appreciation of the Hibiscus blooming so lustily on your deck. Dr. Peter Gardener (get it?), madman to the max. Reading, I could picture Ms. Nunez saying, What more horrible abomination can we dream up for Dr. Gardener to perform?I didn't get anything of redeeming value from this book. It's not about love, however nobly one tries to conjure it from this book. Prospero's Daughter is a vision of hell on earth. A three because hell was quite well described."
3,"Setting is wonderfully rendered, rich in nostalgia, but characters are too starkly drawn","This is a book with a message: the history of racism in the West Indies is insupportable. Many wrongs were committed, and sometimes the human spirit prevailed over the corrosion of racism. An important theme, but the characters are such extremes of evil and innocence that the book ends up feeling more like a civics lesson and less like literature. I felt like I was supposed to like it because of the important lesson, but I preferred the setting, the nostalgia, and the triumph of young love over old racism."
3,Dated,"This 1982 album recorded with Brazilian musicians spurned the hit la Balance and was deemed a breakthrough for Belen at the time.The problem with this album is that it's not one thing nor the other being neither a Spanish or a Brazilian album. The slower songs on the set Teresina, Imposible, Planeta Agua and Caminando work for me as they highlight Belen's stunning voice, the more up tempo Disco songs (which I'm sure were great at the time) now seem so very dated and hide Belen's voice behind a bank of synthesisers playing pseudo Brazilian rhythms.If you want a first introduction to Ana Belen I would n't choose this album as the songs are simply not strong enough, try Peces de Ciudad from 2001 or Mirame from 1997 which are far better albums."
5,Strength For The Journey,We are using this in our church's study group. We find it an excellent resource on a wide variety of topics. Peter Gomes is a great preacher with a subtle sense of humor.
3,strength for the journey,i didn't know these were sermans when i purchased the book. it would be good for a person who couldn't make it out to church on Sunday's.
4,Why don't my relatives leave me graveyards when they die?,This may be the funniest graphic novel that I've read in a LONG time! One of my friends brought it home from a honeymoon trip and it's been making the rounds ever since. Abbey is the coolest vampire chick I've seen in ages. The scene with her & Paris and the phone book made us all howl for hours. Buy this book- you won't regret it!
3,MY REVIEW,"ITS A PRETTY GOOD CDI TEND TO LIKE THE ALAN PARSONS PROJECT,AND OTHER CDS I HAVE IN MY COLLECTION"
4,Try this cd more than once,"This cd would require a lot of listening to enjoy. Alan Parsons' album is like a meal complete with appetizers, main course, dessert etc. He could be the only artist who offers this musical menu: the ballad, pop rock, love song, prog rock and his distinct instrumentals. This album may have all those on the menu but not catchy as his records in the 70's and 80's. AP seems to be trying to get the feel of the 90's after a long sojourn from his last LP. But for APP fans trying to complete their musical diet this is a must on the table. AP was able to go back in his time machine reliving the grandeur of his 70's-80's output with 2004's Valid Path, which is an excellent album reminiscent of his creative years."
3,"Not APP anymore, is it...","It's too bad that the Parsons-Woolfson team couldn't continue forever. While there were hints of former APP days in this album, it's clear that the Alan Parson's Project is no more. Luckily, there is enough of the old spirit carried over by Parsons in this work to keep APP fans buying and listening. Tracks like ""Breakaway,"" ""Mr. Time,"" and ""Jigue"" made me glad I bought the CD. If you're looking for more APP in the vein of ""Turn of a Friendly Card"" or similar calmer techno works this is not the CD for you. It is, however, the bridging work between APP and Alan Parson's recent work. Life goes on, times change, but threads of the past peak through here and there."
4,Must have for 'Oh Life' alone,"A close friend of mine taped this for me, and I absolutely love, and cry over 'Oh Life' sung by David Pack of Ambrosia. What a heart-wrenching song! I also love 'Turn it Up'-great to run to.Susan"
5,Try Everything Twice,"When i first heard the music of Alan Parsons,i liked it at the first listening. I think it was ""Don't answer me"" some time in the early 80's. It was not until at the start of the 00's, when i began to buy the cd's. ""Try anything once"" is absolutely awesome and i like it very much. Progressive soft rock is really my cup of tea. The songs are well-arranged and well-produced, but of course it is Alan Parsons! I hope he will do some more music in the future."
5,Overlooked and self transforming AP,"I must say that this is the only AP album I keep separated form alll other AP works. Sure the great instrumentals are there (2 of them), you have a female vocal doing an impressive theme (Mr. Time), you have all sort of good songs. yet this album is far differnt form Ammnia, Turn of the Cards, etc, etc.For those of you who are ready to reproach me on the basis that a 43 yo man with professional and fanily responsabilities is dedicating some time to a reveiew of a pop-rock album, please concede a mercy-of-the-court to explain myself. y message goes to all those us who even forgot this music existed and whose responsabilities impede going back to the nostalgic road of yesterday. I praise the merits of this album in hope that those of you who have kids listening to prent music, and specially those whose kids are hearing dreadful Rap, that this is an osais you can turn to and guide them though a melodic dimmension."
5,No more fluff,"For Alan Parsons' music, shedding Eric Woolfson is like shedding extra cargo that keeps a plane from taking off. This music has some EDGE to it for a change! Clearly his best CD ever if you like hard-hitting guitar and memorable songs but don't like syrupy vocals or too much techno."
3,Has Some Good Moments.,"I bought this a few years ago around the time that it was released. I haven't listened to Try Anything Once for quite some time until recently. While there's no doubt that the musicianship and production of this album is above average, the songs are really just average. A handful of songs are pretty good, but a lot of this album is a bit insipid and uninteresting. That aside, I still think Alan Parson's does put out some pretty decent material. This is still worth a listen and has some good moments."
1,No Eric Woolfson = bad album,"This is really a poor piece of work. It is really lacking. The songs are terrible. The lead singer leads much to be desired. How can all of these other reviewers say anything good about this garbage??? Alan Parsons had some sort of falling out with Eric Woolfson and his work with his ""new band"" just is not the same. If you're looking for Alan Parsons Project greats buy Turn of a Friendly Card or Ammonia Avenue or Eye in the Sky. Even Pyramid and Vulture Culture are good recordings. This one is scraping the bottom. Don't waste your money."
5,easy to listen to,Heard some of this before but was good to listen to again --- some new facts that I didn't know about --- quite interesting --- a must for all to see
2,Early Miles available in better collections,"Songs are from the widely available Dial recording sessions of Charlie Parker, 1946-47:Track Listing (studio recs., dates probable):1. Night in Tunisia (3/28/46)2. Dewey Square (10/28/47)3. Yardbird Suite (3/28/46)4. Ornithology (3/28/46)5. Scrapple from the Apple (11/4/47)6. Embraceable You (10/28/47)7. Bird of Paradise (10/28/47)8. Moose the Mooche (3/28/46)9. Don't Blame Me (11/4/47)10. Cool Blues (2/19/47) [Miles not on this track]"
2,A rip off at half this price,Not worth your time. It is a bootleg-quality compilation of Charlie Parker tracks. Not all of them even feature Miles Davis. Sound quality is very poor. Look elsewhere for far better collections of this music.
3,"This should be a Charlie Parker set, not Miles","(I don't usually write short reviews, but there is not much to write here.)I am a HUGE Miles Davis fan. And, since I am a Miles fan, I found this CD in a bargain bin and bought it at a cheap price.I think this set is worthy of three stars, but this is not a Miles Davis set. This is a Charlie Parker set. And, as a previous reviewer pointed out, on 'Cool Blues,' Miles doesn't even play on that track. That is track that features Charlie and Dizzy Gillespie. And, the sound quality leaves much to be desired.Overall, if you want Bird and Miles together, look for a regular Charlie Parker compilation. But my advice is unless you see it in a bargain bin, just avoid this."
3,Not the worst,"I own many bootleg Miles Davis albums from all over...Tokyo, Stockholm, Belgrade from all periods of his career. This technically isn't one of them (as you can imagine, being that it is on Amazon). However, it certainly does not match the quality of studio recordings from Columbia or Prestige and is obviously a loosely selected mismatch of Davis-Parker recordings (except for the last track which is OBVIOUSLY Dizzy, not Miles at all). It's all classic bebop, not something that you hear often from Miles so it's a very interesting album. However, if you buy large import compilations of Parker (such as Golden Greats...about 60 tracks for $20) you well get all of these and so much more. However, this was the second ""Miles Davis"" album I ever owned (after Kind of Blue) and still have a sentimental place for these poor recordings in my heart."
2,If It Sounds Too Good to Be True....,"I bought this off a discount rack in a grocery store. Being a fan of Miles Davis, I thought ""Cool-- a compilation with ten tracks I don't have for under six bucks."" But when I got home and put the CD in my player, what I got was something that sounds like someone walked into a concert with a mini tape recorder and hit ""record""-- while leaving the thing in his pocket.While this collection may be of some interest to archivists, for anyone else it's a matter of ""You get what you pay for."" And in this case, maybe even less."
5,Great book - but unable to find,"This is a great book; however, you will not be able to buy it from this site new. I recommend buying a used copy. I placed an order for this book (new)in the middle of 2006 - it is now February 2007 and the book has not been delivered. If you want a copy of this wonderful book, you will have to buy a used copy."
4,Intech Pop up driving net with target,"I installed the Intec driving net in my garage for use during the winter months. The net was not very stable on the concrete floor because its intended to be used out of doors, but I made a stand for it and its works just fine. It allows me to get those swings during the winter months. I wish Intec would go the extra step and make an attachment for concrete floors.-Jim"
2,Insufficient research,"This author falls into the same trap that's been laid for researchers for the past 135 years. The most glaring example is the standard portrayal of Kilpatrick at Gettysburg, all of which is based on one source who admitted years later he was never a witness to what actually happened or was said on the field that day. Like researchers before him, the author missed this glaring truth.Here are two hints of Kilpatrick's character and performance: (1) His men held him in such high esteem that they petitioned Lincoln to have him promoted to general (a rare occurrence in the CW); and (2) after the battle of Gettysburg his men presented their commander with a Damascus sword in appreciation for his leadership on July 3.In short, an author who doesn't dig deeper than his predecessors is dancing to the worn-out tune of incredulity."
4,Beats other rollers but still not amazing!,"I got these rollers after much research that said these were the best. I needed to find some rollers that could handle my THICK THICK THICK and heavy hair. Well as far as Rollers go, I think they are the best on the market - I love the steam, they make my hair silky and soft, and although you only heat one roller at a time it only takes seconds to do so. No other rollers have come with clips as good as these ones that actually HOLD the roller in place for more than a minute, so I LOVE that about these ones. So on the negative....they curl, but the curl does not last as long as hoped. In summary: Great rollers, the only ones EVER to have actually stayed in place in my hair and curled my hair well, but not as long a lasting curl as I had hoped for such expensive rollers. Curl lasts about 3 hours."
4,Caruso Ion Steam Hairsetter,"I really like this hairsetter. The best part is the steam and spongy rollers, as they keep my hair soft. They're extremely easy to use. Also, even though you can only steam one roller at a time I can roll my hair, which is down to the middle of my back, just as quickly as with a conventional hot roller set. I have read other reviews that say the roller shields don't hold and fall off easily. This never happens for me. Once the shield is on, it stays on until I take it off. The only down side is the ends of my hair don't seem to hold the curl as tightly as the rest of my hair for more than half the day. It's not enough of a problem for me to stop using them. I think it's a great product and would recommend it to my friends."
3,need to buy converter,"product good but voltage only 120v, not universal as stated in amazon description. need to buy extra converter to function 220v"
1,The worst bass book ever written,"The word that one of my new students used was ""CHEESY""It is by far the most uninteresting and uninspiring teaching material for bass EVER"
2,It's...too...small,"In three easy little words the best way to describe this toy is, it's too small. I bought this for my one year old and he is already too big for it, as well as we have another rocking horse for my 2 1/2 year old son and it drawfs this one. We are disappointed, it is simply too small."
5,Good buy for a 1 year old....,"We purchased this toy for my 1 year old, she's always climbing on her stuffed animals. She has been playing with it non-stop since Christmas. Great value versus paying $80++ for a similar and bigger one she wouldn't be able to mount by herself. It's the perfect size for her, the transition from rocking to rolling is easy. She loves to ride on it and push it. My 4 and 3 year old play on it also. Easy to assemble, the horse is very comfy. We all like the horsey song it plays too!"
3,Warning - this thing sings!,"My daughter (2) and son (4) do enjoy riding on the horse and, unfortunately, love to squeeze its ears to listen to the really annoying song that it sings. Of course, this is the one toy that comes with a battery in it. If you can deal with the song, your kids will like it."
4,Sun Tan's The Art of War,"Sun Tan's The Art of War with George Alexander breaks down this martial art into chapters. With detail and different view points of each technique, you will get a brife historical background of the technique and the reason it was developed."
2,"not horrid, yet not awsome","This is adiscrace to Indiana Jones. One of the problems is if you hit someone with a chair they die in one hit yet it takes 8-10 hits to kill someone with a machete. and to add insult to injury it takes 2-4 shot to kill someone with a gun even if you shoot them in the head. LucasArts need to get their prioratys straight, a gun and a machete are more lethal than a chair."
5,"So far, this is a top 10 game!","Stop what you are doing and buy Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb RIGHT NOW! It is a must buy, maybe even a keeper (we'll have to wait and see how it finishes up). The graphics are an A, the music is an A, the punches and revolver action is an A+, the story so far is good, just like a movie script, but I will wait on giving it a rating, the voice acting for Prof. Jones is an A+ (at first I thought it was really Harrison Ford, but it's not, that's how good it is!), great interaction with the environments (you can smash a chair or table and use it to fight bad guys (so even if you are low on bullets, you can find weapons to use in each room), and the missions are just the right amount of hard (I have it on normal) with good use of save points. I held off on getting Tomb Raider and reserved Indiana Jones instead and it was well worth the wait. So far, I have to put this in my top 10 games of all time and I've only just started it."
3,"Decent game, especially found at a decent price","First of all this isn't that bad of a game but it's not worth $49, $39 or even $29. If you can find it for $20 or less (perferably less) then it's worth getting. The voice acting is good, despite the slight fuzziness the graphics have at times and no random saves the game is good, especially the story line, almost just like the movies. The main reason I give this game a 3 is because of the Kraken (not the Kraken from the Clash of the Titans movie), is a pain in the A.. literally, I tried to beat him for an hour and gave up, maybe after awhile I'll go back to the game but I'm not in a hurry. The Gates of Neptune level is pretty annoying too, the concept is cool but it can be frustrating. I recommend a strategy guide for this, especially if you're not that good at solving puzzles. If you're a fan of the Indiana Jones series, this is worth having just for that."
3,You a masochist?,"Great game, but without the ability to ""save as you go"", it seems this thing was written by a sadist."
3,"Average, just average.","This game is just like Tomb Raider. Nuff said! The likenesses aren't realistic (I can't believe someone said that Indy in the game looked like Harrison Ford, which is very untrue, this guy looks like a cardboard box). If you want a fun game to play, play True Crime: Streets of LA (NOT LOUISIANA, Los Angeles) or Enter the Matrix. Those are both very good and fun games. But if you must try the experience of an Indiana Jones game, then by all means play it, but rent it first!"
5,"If Adventure has a name, it must be...Indiana jones!","This game is awesome. The controls are easy to learn, and the gameplay is great! This game does have some cons though. But we'll get to those later. The game consits of 9 different missons. Each misson is divided up into a random amount of levels. The game has 51 levels total. The 9 missons take you to these places as follows: Ceylon(9 levels), Prauge(13 levels)Istanbul(7 levels), and Hong Kong(4 levels) Yes, I know that's only 4 missons. That's because I'm currently in Istanbul. The guys you fight at the beginning of the game are wimps, but the enemies gradually get stronger as the game continues.The voice overs are superb, and the combat is even better. Want to get a taste of it? In Prauge I snuck up on a guard who was overlooking a ledge. I then shot him with my pistol. He fell overboard. Cool,huh? Now for the cons:No Save Points!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Every time you die you have to start at the beginning of the level.Other then that, fun game!"
4,A good adventure game.,"This game starts on Ceylon, and Indy tries to find a artifact, and later goes to China, and Istanbul and Prague. The story is fairly good. The missions are good, as they include racing for you're life from a drill tank, battling off evil spirts with a pacheng, swimming in croc' infested waters, taking on a horrible human like creature, and even killing a kraken with a spear gun and demolition charges. It is challenging, with traps, strong and smart enemies, and incredibly hard bosses. The graphics are O.K, and the voices are O.K. Buy it, but don't if ya' don't like adventure."
3,great game.....but,"Levels are needlessly complicated often you find yourself standing back where you started wondering where to go next. Game saves only at end of level so you are always restarting the level if you get killed which makes replay value a big zero because you have to play each level over and over. not for the casual gamer or novice but if you are willing to play slow and steady the story is good the action is fun, not a must buy, I would rent it first"
1,lil children,Bought this game influened by tomb raider. Wrong! Sell them to lil chidren and find us a way to know the quality before purchase.
3,indiana kicks emperor's butt,"Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb is a lot of action filled, puzzle solving, fedora and whip wielding at its best. Fans of Indiana Jones will not be disappointed. The levels are fun and creative as Indiana travels around the globe fighting a evil cult and violent nazis."
4,VERY Fun,"This is mostlikely the BEST GAME EVER.You can use lots of guns(MP40,silenced lugar,revolver,etc.),and finally,your whip and fists.The only downside is that in between the cutscenes theres a glitch,and theres always a beeping noise in the game but THAT'S IT.It has ten chapters,with levels inside, and a great story-line.This game is rated T for violence.BEST GAME EVER."
3,ive seen better,ive seen a much more accurate book in my public library. this book did detail some things i was wondering about and the writiing was clear and concice so 3 stars.
4,This is a great book that was also turned into a great movie,"The first time I read this book I was around 12-13 yrs. old, the same age as the heroine of the story. Later, as a mature adult, I read it again and it held up just the same . This is a great story of independence for all ages. Rynn the main character is someone I still admire. She is strong and takes no guff!!( haha! I hate that saying, but it describes Rynn to a tea)(Oh I hate the saying ""to a tea"" also.) It is no wonder that in the movie the Rynn character is played by a young Jodie Foster. Rynn is a very typical Jodie Foster character. She is a survivor. This story is perfect if you like mysteries with a little creepiness and a touch of romance thrown in. If you are familiar with the movie and then read the book, you will be very surprised at how true the movie stayed to the book."
4,First page captures you.,This author has a wonderful way of describing a scene in such vivid detail that you see the scene more vividly than would be possible with a movie. The style of writing is different but the way of describing scenes reminded me of Thomas Hardy. Koenig also introduces enough suspense every few pages that you feel compelled to read another chapter but then it whets the appetite for another. My wife read the book in a single sitting. I am a slow reader but after the third day I had to finish it.
4,Create a Life that Feeds Your Soul,"I enjoyed Tama's writing style and honesty. This story is inspirational to people who are stopped by 'shoulds' and judgment in their lives. She shows us how to trust our inner voice during times of change, how to remain constant and sacrifice the superfluous for what matters most. She is an example of making a difference in this world by having the courage to follow her true path."
5,"Real, genuine, inspirational","I read this back in 2007 to understand Tama's approach before registering for Tama's weekend workshop ""Unleash Your Calling"". I loved her book, attended her workshop and have remained linked to Tama since then through her newlsetters and on-line courses. She is practical, real and genuine and what resonated with me back in 2007, still does today. Highly recommended for anyone wondering about how to just pause and reflect on what might be next in their life."
4,Good Book,I enjoyed the inspiration given in this book about doing what you love. I wanted more information though on how to go about finding out what my life's purpose/work is.
1,Great topic - poorly written book,"I enjoy reading books on this topic, but this one is so poorly written that I could not finish it. I feel rather hoodwinked by the ""glowing"" reviews that prompted me to purchase it in the first place. Great topic, but there's something to be said for well-crafted prose that is neither trite nor cliched. The author would do well to put some energy into learning the craft and then trying again."
2,Polyphonica Crimson S,"If you want to know what this DVD is about,read the back as it gives a fair discribtion of the rather weird but somewhat interesting storyline and a production worth about 4 stars,maybe 4 and 1/2. DISREGARD the cover artwork,however! That ""person"" does NOT exist in this production. She is,instead,a cute,short,quick-tempered,redheaded spitfire. She is not soft and alluring and there is no fanservice to speak of. If you want to spend the money on an somewhat interesting story,you could do worse.But,if you think the cover art is anywhere indicative of what is on the disks,you will be very upset to discover it isn't so and is somewhat like seeing a picture of the Virin Mary in a bikini pasted on the cover of a Bible."
3,missing piece,"I only gave it three stars because one puzzle piece was missing. It's such a pretty puzzle & after spending so many hours putting it together, it was quite disappointing to not have the one piece, especially since I was planning on having it laminated & framed for hanging."
3,JBA cat back,"Replaced rusted out rear section of Jeep Liberty Renegade exhaust with JBA 304 stainless. Price was good...fit, not so good. The rear section won't fit around back axle with gas tank skid plate in place. We had to section the exhaust to make it fit (not ideal). This is a flow through type system, so expect more noise than a conventional counter flow type muffler. Rear plastic bumper valence opening had to be modified (dremel) to fit exhaust tip."
1,Much better books,"I've read much better books on this subject, like:Mobile Commerce: Opportunities, Applications, and Technologies of Wireless Business by Paul May"
5,An Absolute Must-Read,I truly enjoyed reading this book from beginning to end. It's an absolute must-read for any manager interested in understanding mobile business opportunities. The author does an excellent job at covering both business and technology. Lots of valuable insight on where this area is headed. I highly recommend this book.
2,Nothing New,The book didn't tackle any new topic or issue. Just a collection of material already out there. Didn't cover much on Biz models though it is part of the book title.
2,too big for Bladerunner rollerblades,I had a hard time finding breaks and thought this would work because there is not much about what blade brakes go with what I had to guess and this did not work on my blades.....probably going to resale
1,Waste of money!,This brake lasted through 3 20 minute blading sessions in my neighborhood before wearing down to the screw. I think they have created a product that burns quickly in hopes to sell more. Don't waste your money!
1,Worst ever!!!,"I have been inline/street skating actively and vigorously for over 20 years. These are the worst replacement brakes that I have ever had. Typically, the K2 brand replacement black brake stoppers is what I buy. This is the first time that after only 2 street skating excursions (maybe total of 20 miles) the brakes were WORN DOWN to the end. Although I live in a relatively hilly, slightly rural community - It is not unusual for me to have a brake last nearly a month or two... but only 2 days is RIDICULOUS. Perhaps the material that was used to make the brake has changed? I purchased two of these, the second one is on my skate and I'll be pretty aggravated if it doesn't get me through at least a half dozen, aggressive, exhilarating street skates."
3,skid marks,Wished I got the gray...these leave marks everywhere...lol Being an avid skater I go through brakes a lot so this time I thought I would try these...they work great but I much prefer the gray color just so I do not leave marks on surfaces...other than that they were fantastic order...and I received them very quickly.
4,A detailed narrative of a prolific author's life,"I read this book (and all of Asimov's autobiographies) when they were first printed and have read each one at least twice. If you like Asimov's ""gentle reader"" writing style, reading his autobiographies will be fun for you, more so if you want a view into a busy, obsessed writer's life and the forces that shaped him.These books are frank (especially ""I, Asimov""), interesting, and very often amusing.""In Memory Yet Green"" and ""In Joy Still Felt"" are large tomes, totalling about 1550pp together.For a biography of Asimov, you can't do better than these. As he mentioned in his biographies, there's not much in the way of action or big events in these books. It's a long trip through all the words, but the trip is enjoyable."
3,Entertaining and fast moving mystery,"Carrie is very busy with two teenagers, a cop live in boyfriend, and a busy career. So, when her stepmother( who barely tolerates her) announces that she is coming to visit and that she has a problem, Carrie is both annoyed and confused. Eve confides in Carrie that she had a child many years ago who was kidnapped. The child has contacted her and she wants to see him. When she arrived at the appointed place, she found a dead man in the apartment. Carrie suspects that Eve is only telling part of the truth and she wonders if the long lost son is after her father's lottery winnings.This mystery had believable characters for the most part and the mystery was pretty good, with quite a few twists. It is not a difficult mystery, but makes a good beach book."
5,Simply the best....,"We got this as a gift upon the birth of our first child in 1995. My husband or I spent every night in the rocking chair with him listening to this tape. We had to get another one after we wore out the first when our second child came along. I think we enjoyed this tape as much as our child did. It puts you in the mood that makes you feel that everything is o.k., as long as you have the love of your world in your arms, and you are there together. Everytime I need to get a special gift for a baby, I search out this tape or C.D. I am ordering another, and I think I will get extras for my boys. Just hearing the songs brings back the best memories of the time together with both my boys. I have listened to many ""lullaby"" tapes since, and have never heard any that are as warm and comforting as this one."
5,This is the best lullaby music available--from mother of 4,Volume one & two of this series are the very best lullaby songs I have ever heard. One can listen to them over and over again (and believe me...my husband & I have) and NEVER tire of them. They are beautiful. I have four children raging in age from 2 to 12. All four of my children have been relaxed to sleep listening to these songs. I highly recommend them.
3,As expected for the price,"Looks nice, but I found the door shelves to be a bit fragile. Vowed that this would be the last piece of furniture I ever buy that has to be assembled. Seemed to take forever, but I'm not that experienced."
1,how to not release a single in one easy step.,"Unfortunately, this CD single has been cancelled. Very dissapointing. I can only hope that Alanis Morissette will eventually release all the Vancouver Session tracks on one album in the future. For now if you are interested in hearing Alanis' songs in studio acoustic recordings they are available on the following CDs or albums:Feast On Scraps (CD/DVD Combo):Hands Clean (Acoustic)'Everything' CD Singles:Precious Illusions (Vancouver Sessions)Everything (Vancouver Sessions)So Unsexy (Vancouver Sessions)'Out Is Through' CD Singles:Eight Easy Steps (Vancouver Sessions)This Grudge (Vancouver Sessions)Spineless (Vancouver Sessions)Also on June 13, 2005 Alanis will be releasing a tenth anniversary editon of her 95' album Jagged Little Pill. Featuring all the original tracks performed acoustically. It will be available at all Strabucks locations for the first six weeks after its release."
1,Sucks,"Bought this winder March of 2007, one side stopped working in Dec. rotated between watches every other day. The side that stopped working began working out of the blue ine day then two weeks later stopped working for good. SAVE YOUR MONEY. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!"
1,Pass on this watch winder,"Two words, caveat emptor, latin for ""Let the buyer beware"". I have a Tag sport watch, pretty heavy in weight. The left motor failed on me after a good 3 months, I think because it could not support the weight. The price is nice. The design is pretty neat. It's just a waste of time having to deal with the manufacturer to fix it for an item that essentially only cost under $40.00. Pass on this watch winder. Go with something a bit more expensive. Just my opinion . . ."
1,Plastic Junk Not Worth $10,It looks like metal but do not be fooled. It feels and works cheap. It lasted 3 months and one of the dials is inoperative. The second dial roars like a factory machine. I expect it to fail shortly. This product is a disgrace for Amazon to be associated with.
2,works for a while then dies,"worked well, quietly, but as with the other posts it's as if a very short lifetime is designed into it. Mine had a sudden death at around 5 months. I will try a more expensive one next."
2,A disappointment,"If your watch doesn't ""fit in"" the one-size compartment provided here, the watch will wobble and interfere with the turning mechanism.The rotation speed too fast for some watchesVery short-lived for me; it broke within a year.Invest in a more sturdy, reliable piece."
3,Double Watch Winder,"This watch winder might be a good choice for many because it's relatively inexpensive and works well (i.e. quiet). However, after receiving it and browsing through other watch winders, I realized I wanted something a little more stylish and slick looking."
1,A Very Bad Investment,"Exellent service from mailing company for an unreliable product. The Tech Swiss Double Automatic Watch Winder I received recently did not work at all, so I contacted the company and received an immediate replacement which worked rather loudly for 3 days and died! I Give Up !!!"
1,Awful,"I've had 2...both stopped working after 3 weeks. Cheap price for a watch winder, but it is all plastic and both units didn't function for more then a month...stay away."
4,It's a winder,"It is what it is. It does what it says. It's not loud. If you have the watch in wrong it makes a knocking sound that is VERY annoying, but that is user problem, not product. It is not very appealing in appearance, but it does what it is supposed to for a very good price. We have had it since before Christmas and my husband keeps his watches on it allll the time. Seems to be working fine."
1,Low quality!!!,"I have bought this item last year, and now only one motor is working and the other one is not, and it produces light noise at night when it is rotating."
1,Noisy,The product is very noisy; and I must keep it in a room where no one sleeps. I wouldn't buy again.
2,a product that hates Rolex.,"does not keep my Rolex winded,it is ok as I have other kinetic watches and it works ok with them."
2,3 meses y ya dejo de funcionar el lado derecho,De plastico pero por el precio no importa. Lo importante es su funcionamiento y aposte por este modelo a pesar de otros comentarios negativos porque pense que necesitando solo uno tengo el doble de oportunidades de obtener un producto duradero.Veamos cuanto dura el lado izquierdo.
3,Automatic watch winder-horizontal version,"Bought the Time Tutelary version in December 2006. It is now May 2007 and the unit has died. Both motors appear to been burnt out. The turntables will not rotate. When they were working, the unit was quiet and kept my bulky watches wound up enough to provide several hours of accurate time.Luckily, the unit only cost me $35.00. I'll try the vertical $50.00 version to see if I get better performance."
4,Tech Swiss Double Automatic Watch Winder,"The product works as promised, however the counterclockwise rotation does not seem to keep my watch wound (only the clockwise rotation). This is probably an issue with my watch type (Invicta Ocean Ghost)."
4,Best value Automatic Watch Winder,"For the low price that I paid for this item, it is fabulous! The next cheapest winder was well over $100. I can't see why anyone would spend that much when this watch winder looks great and works great. My one small complaint is that it makes a small amount of noise, but no more than a clock ticking. Overall, a great value for the money!"
4,Watchwinder,"Very good product for the money. Not perfectly silent, but still very quiet. I have owned several winders and the wind/rest feature keeps the watches from overwinding.Recommend buy."
2,Not worth the money,"I had ordered this to consolidate a couple of my watch winders. It was broken within a few weeks. At this point, it is only a dust collector that holds 2 non automatic watches. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,"don't bother, it's junk","Don't waste your time and good money, spend more and get something that will work for more than 3 months."
2,Not worth it,Makes a lot of noise and broke after a couple of months. Buy a more expensive one....its a waste of money!
1,BEWARE !!!!!! DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!,"Bought this item because of the price... I regret I did everyday because I got what I paid for ... cheap material non-lasting piece of equipement. It came dead on arrival (DOA), got it repaired and it lasted four months. BEWARE !!!"
1,Do Not Buy this Product ... Very Poor Quality,"I would highly recommend NOT purchasing this product for the following reasons:(1) The winder motors are extremely loud. So loud in fact, that my wife insisted that the winder be moved out of our bedroom because it woke her up whenever the motors turned on.(2) I purchased the winder in June of 2006 and one of the winder motors died within 1 year ... the second motor quit working within 2.5 years."
1,inop for Seiko Kinetic,doesn't appear to charge the watch movement at all;maybe a continuous and/or high speed setting would work.I wasted the money for this product.Tech Swiss Double Automatic Watch Winder With Built in Timer Rotates 1 Hour and Rests 3 Hours.
5,Worth every penny!,"This double watch winder is very nice, and works exactly as described. The double watch winder is well built and is reasonably quit when turning."
2,Left My Seiko Kinetic Motionless,"I've owned a fairly heavy Seiko Kinetic for several years and recently had it repaired when it began having trouble holding a charge. To avoid problems with my reenergized time piece, I decided to invest in a winder. After comparing online prices and reading dozens of reviews, I thought I had found a reasonably priced solution to keep my Seiko moving. This winder does everything it's supposed to do (spin, stop, reverse, etc.) but can't provide sufficient motion to activate the charging mechanism inside my heavyweight watch. Unfortunately, my kinetic may have made it's final sweep around the dial. On the bright side, I now have a winder that I can only hope does a better job with my NEXT automatic watch."
2,Watch Winder,The watch winder I received was missing brand name and the gear inside the winder is making a lot of noise which I can live by.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"The watch winder is very quiet and inexpensive. However, the quality is suspect - one side stopped rotating after a week. You probably get what you pay for. Too much hassle and does not make economic sense to ship back and incur international shipping charges."
1,Stopped Working within 2 weeks,Product stopped working within two weeks.....too noisy when it was working. What a waste of money!
3,Not the best!,"I purchased two winders one is silent the other is loud. If you have a heavy watch it will slip and make noise. What I did was put paper towel between the clasp of the watch and the winder holder to hold it in place, works nicely. So, you have a fifty-fifty chance of getting a silent winder. However, the winder does work nicely."
3,LITTLE NOISY,"It worked fine. But,It's little noisy. I can't put in my living or bedroom.I have to put it in the closet."
5,Kenkel hard shall Nutcracker Does the Job,I used my nut cracker for opening hickory nuts. The Kenkel hard shell nutcracker did it's job perfectly. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to enjoy their hard shall nuts being produced from trees in their yard. You won't be disappointed.
4,great deal,"I shopped around on several sites looking for the perfect chairs to accent my kitchen area and boy old boy did I make the right choice. They arrived on scheduled and undamaged. Once assembled they look outstanding, luv em...."
5,Surpassed Expectations,"My husband and I are thrilled with these bar stools. I have not seen anything else come close in quality for this price, and I spent a lot of time looking! One thing to mention: The ""Old Steel Finish"" actually was a little more bronze in color than the pictures. For us, that was a big plus; hopefully that will be helpful to someone else considering these stools. One other item to be aware of: The seat is truly 32"" off the floor.....many bar stools are 30"", so if you are vertically challenged, that may be an issue. Once again, we are very happy with both the appearance, and the sturdy ""feel"" of these stools."
5,Another Great Book from Janette Oke,"On one snowy, stormy day, a young school teacher, Ariana Benson, is kidnapped from her school, her home, and her very way of life. She is taken to a rough, crass camp, where ""the Boss"" assigns his son Laramie the task of guarding her. From that day on, Ariana's life is never the same. The two fall in love, but are their plans are halted when Laramie discovers the lace cuff of Ariana's mother's wedding gown in his mother's chest. What can this mysterious coincidence mean? And what are they to do about it? This is the story of a young woman and her kidnapping, disappoinments, and true love, and her steady faith in God which gets her through it all."
5,Kept me completely on the edge of my seat!!!!,"This book is the best book I have read of Janette Okes so far!!!! I was very into it!!! The ending was so fabulous.I was kind of upset to find that Laramie and Ariana were brother and sister,but as I continued reading,as always Janette Oke suprised us!!!! What a GREAT ending!!!!! Thanx Janette Oke for writing such wonderful Christian books!! My friends and I read them all the time."
5,My favorite Janette Oke book!,"I loved this book. It kept me engrossed the whole time, I couldn't put it down. I think I'll read it again."
3,Least favorite of Ms. Oke's books,"I'm a fanatical fan of Janette Oke's books. I've read almost all of her books, and immensly enjoyed nearly all of them. Usually I pick one up and am done with it by the next day, this one took me a while. I just couldn't get into it. It just didn't have the same quality as many of her other books. Usually I'm sobbing by the last 3/4 of the book, but on this one I felt like the task of getting it done was more important than the ending.If you are as big of a fan as me, still read the book. I just is not the best one to start on."
3,Kickaroos Anti Gravity Boots,"I had ordered the Air Kicks, but they were not available by Christmas, so they substituted Kickaroos (with my permission). The theory is great, but in reality, you can barely get off the ground with them. The plastic piece on the front keeps slipping off after a few jumps, and so you are constantly sliding it back. The sub price was great, so I guess it's an ok deal, but had I paid full price, I would have been disappointed."
4,Brighten your table with placemats,These placemats are attractive and durable. They are great for everyday use but not rich looking enough to use if your trying to impress your guests. Easy to clean off even though they are not plastic.
5,"The lost, and beautiful Nirvana song!","Sad, Sappy, Verse Chorus Verse, Laundry Room, or Make You Unhappy. What ever you call it, it is on this CD! Buy the CD, for that reason alone!"
3,"Generic, with benefits","When this first appeared, No Alternative was an excellent crash course in the budding genre, from popular acts to lesser known artists and many stuck in between. While new songs from Nirvana and the Pumpkins assured wide distribution, and quite a few notable entries including Breeders and Uncle Tupelo live up to those high compilation standards, a good half of the disc has been relegated to the apathetic-audio category."
2,Normally I'm open minded,"Sorry, this CD just isn't the exact genre that I was thinking. Buying the wrong kind of compilation was my mistake, but with the Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, i thought maybe it was going to be a little heavier than what it was. Turned out to be the light alt-pop bands from the 90's.This would have gotten three stars, but the song by Pavement that was dissing R.E.M. just threw me over the edge.I would recommend Sub Pop 200, or maybe DGC Rarities instead of this, but if you like 90's alt-pop, this is for you. If you want heavier, more like Nirvana, get Sub Pop 200."
5,Family Above Party (or Exclusive Religions),"I had the pleasure,on the flight from Lubbock to Dallas, of sitting next to the wife of Senator Frist. I was not planning to comment on this book, but because the marital relationship is mentioned above, and because I love non-fiction books deeply, I just want to say that the author is a real person, a personable person, and this book should be bought on its merits.It does not cover the negative father-daughter relationships, only the positive ones. If you are a father with daughters, buy this book for its example of what worked, what left lasting love in the hearts of daddy's daughters. The family, not the party, is the foundation of this Nation's greatness (and its current decline in broken and non-nuclear families in name only}, so I regard this book as one of the building blocks for getting us back on track."
1,Pass on this one & try one of their great recent discs,"It is hard to understand what went wrong in the studio in 1980 & 81 for the ABB to have put out this bad of music. They had just come off of one of their best studio albums in Enlightened Rogues in 1979, which was back to the basics dual guitar ABB. I own every major release ever by this band & returned this bomb. If you are looking to expand beyond the early ABB classics, go for An Evening With the ABB, Where It All Begins or Seven Turns all from the post 1989 reunion period. Gregg's last solo disc (Searchin for Simplicity) is wonderful, too. They have come back on fire and have put real ABB records with all four living original members sounding as inspired as ever. I am not sure what went wrong during this brief period of time in their history. The band broke up for 8 years after this time if that tells you anything."
1,Disgusting!,"Turned my stomach right from the opening scene! Deplorable inhumane slaughtering of animals cannot ever be mistaken for ""genius"". I watched about 45 seconds and was sick to my stomach."
1,Too hard to manage,"I do like money making games, but this is like... That wouldn't happen in real life. You may all be like, uh, yah, that's the whole purpose! Yah, but this is kind of hard to manage. Another thing is, it is so slow on our old computer, yet it doesn't even work on our new computer. if you want this game, you probally want a Windows 98, wich is very old school, well, to me. I just might not like this game, or just a spoiled brat, tell me."
2,Nil...title kinda says it all...nothing to see here folks,"Big time fan of Crowded House and Neil's 1st solo CD ""Try Whistling This"" (1 of my all time faves).Nil was a bit of a let down, it only has 1 song with any sort of spark.""Driving Me Mad"" is the only song I'd call good on this CD.The rest of the CD is kind of annoying, maybe It'll grow on me, but I doubt it."
4,Reminds me of growing up!,"I have heard that much one's favorite music comes from their adolescent days, when they are growing up and becoming an adult. I'd say that is true of me. I was in high school from 1994-1998, and I'd say many of my favorite tunes are from those days, including the title track from this album, ""The Sign."" To me, it is the perfect pop song. I really only like about half of this album: the first 5 songs plus ""Happy Nation."" But I rate it with 4 stars because I think those 6 songs are all about perfect pop songs, and also because of the nostalgia this album gives me!"
3,Some catchy tunes but nothing great,"This CD, their debut, spawned 3 Top 40 hits with ""All that She Wants"", ""Don't Turn Around"" and the title track all charting in the U.S. The Swedish pop act had some at the time questioning if it would be a 90s ABBA (owing to its tight harmony based around the 2 female lead singers and a knack for a catchy hook) although history has shown us otherwise.Most of the songs sound relatively similar to the hits, although ""Young and Proud"" flirts at time with a more techno sound, adding some extra keyboard blips here and there. It suffers from a smell of plagairism, though, greatly resembling Black Box's ""I Don't Know Anybody Else"" in its piano track.""Living in Danger"" is probably the 'lost hit' that might have done something for them but didn't. The hook to it is relatively solid. Nothing else here really stands out as particularly interesting.2 1/2 stars"
5,Awesome! Just like a greatest hits CD in a debut!,"I got this CD only for ""The Sign"" single, but what a surprise! This debut CD is like a greatest hits disc! Every single song is great to listen to and you can listen to it over and over again! As a matter of fact, 9 of the 12 tracks were turned into singles! The songs sound very similar, but each has a catchy beat and are instantly easy to listen to. Great debut by this foursome!"
4,good CD,"most of songs are good and well-known, I like first 7 or 8, the last songs are less known and not as good, but overall it's a good album if you listened to Ace of Base many years ago"
3,"Well, I used to like it...","But now I realize that the music is manufactured and the songs simply are not that good. I recommend it to those who enjoy mainstream music, but even to them this album will get boring. ""All That She Wants"" and ""The Sign"" are good tunes, though."
5,WOW!,"This CD is simply awesome! I tell you why. It contains the smash hits ""All that she wants"", ""Don't turn around"", ""The sign"". These songs are the best songs ever! Good lyrics and tunes, i love it. I also love the songs ""Dancer in a daydream"" ""Voule vous dancer"" ""Wheel of fortune"" and ""Young and proud"". I also like the remix of A.T.S.W. This CD deserves 1,000,000,stars! All the songs are awesome, except ""Waiting for magic"" which isn't very good, but the rest of the songs are excellent! Buy this CD, it's the best! I HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL."
5,One of the Postmodernistic words and sound,"When I hear the words of the songs in this album, how amazing to feel the bits and the flips of the characters in the postmodern generation of the end of the 20th century. I would rather call them the ""Joker of Base."""
4,Light pop that has its place,"Yeah, the group was compared to ABBA, although its ""shelflife"" was not very long.But, as a debut album, ""The Sign"" spawned three top singles, plus a couple of club cuts.'Not bad for a first time out."
5,ALIVE,"Ace of Base is Awesome! I love every song on this album and every other Ace of Base album out there. They are fresh and alive. That's the best single concept to describe their music I can think of. They believe in life. This CD is the ""youngest"" of their albums and has that feel. All of Ace of Base's music is unique and deserves more recognition. They are original and deep. They have a sound that's always looking ahead with strength. Or maybe much other pop music is sort of depressed. Linn and Jenny's voices are awesome too. Expressing emotion that just isn't in other music. Cool calm strength. Ace of Base Rules!"
5,So wonderful...,"This album is great. I used to like it some years ago, and giving it a re-listen is flooding me with memories. It's quite amazing."
5,fast shipping,"The shipping from this seller is super fast! And the item is exactly what it says, thanks so much."
3,Better than ABBA?,"I could not sit down and listen to ABBA. ABBA was something you put on when you were doing housework or driving. I can sit down and listen to this album. It is dance fluff, but good dance fluff. There are not enough strong songs for me to rate it 4 stars, but there is definitely enough to make it worth buying if you are looking for solid dance/pop."
5,I'll sum it up.,"Let me put it this way, I am a 21 year-old percussion/jazz performance student at a university, and I teach a couple drumlines on the side. I listen to just about everything, but mostly funk and progressive rock...I love this album. It's one of those albums that you can't get past the first five tracks with out starting it over again because it is so awesome, only to find out that the best is still to come.I only have a few albums in my collection that I can honestly say are over 75% solid, and this one is like 95%....and Linn and Jenny are GORGEOUS."
4,The Sign...,"Yes, I saw ""The Sign"" and finally bought it after all these years. The Ace of Base prove themselves as a good (modern) Pop Group. Danceable tunes and decent ballads."
2,"uneven, occasionally horrendous, rarely brilliant...","""The Sign"" features many songs that were hits. But surely even the biggest Ace of Base fan understands ""The Sign"", ""All That She Wants"", and ""Don't Turn Around"" are remarkabley uneven. They have a certain flow despite thir unevenness.Unfortunately the songs ""Wheel of Fortune"", ""Voluez-Vous Danser"", ""My Mind"", and ""Dancer in a Daydream"" don't share the charm the others mentioned did.There is one sole brilliant song on the whole album, the amazing ""Happy Nation"", which is one of the best songs to be released in the 1990's.Still, there is definately something amiss when we hear the screeching found on ""Young and Proud""."
4,This is a good mini-series book,"This is the last but one book in a Sweet Valley High miniseries, at it makes a nice build up to the final (and much more exciting) conclusion. The Prom Thriller mini-series follows the story of Margo Black, who wants to murder Elizabeth Wakefield. It was good, and I liked the scenes at Olivia's costume party but it isn't very good on its own. You should read the mini-series."
5,amazing,"I NEVER write reviews on anything. But this is my only exception. I got this as a gift for my baby shower 5 and years ago and played it fir my ""high-strung"" son. It worked like a charm. By 4 months he was sleeping through the night. I would put it on repeat the entire night very, very quietly. When he woke, he fussed a little then went right back to sleep. We accidentally forgot the cd when we went out of town... nothing worked... not even Josh Groben (sp?). When we got home, my husband put it on our itunes library so we never go without it again."
2,Definitely Not John Fahey,"THis is cute considering that it is more or less just a vanity release from back in the heyday of stoned white boys pretending that they had some sort of street credibility that would allow them to come off as ""authentic"" blues players. Adelphi records where known for the recording and release of local ""B League"" guitarists that couldn't ever hope to reside on Fahey's Tacoma label. Fahey was on the money when he decided not to sing and just play his guitar. Unfortunately Firk did not make that same wise decision. His vocals are so bad I am at a loss for words to describe them. Firk developed into a fine guitarist and his 2001 release on The Physical World label (PWCD-P102) ""What You Think This Is"" Shows off his mastery of blues and ragtime acoustic guitar playing, alas the vocals are still bad but at least more suitable due to the tongue in cheek nature of his original lyrics and the decision to abandon the hokey posturing that was present 30 years ago."
3,ok but not great,useful but does not include a lot of useful information about changing parts on the car. does not provide much more than the instruction manual that comes with the car.
5,this is what a christmas album should sound like!,"I am not a big fan of the old fashioned chrismas carols, but i really liked this album. If you ignored the words, you would mistake it for one of alan's best country albums. these are christmas songs with a definate country twist, some funny songs, sad songs, melancholy songs, the whole spectrum of emotion. The only misstep for me was track 9, a duet with the chipmunks. I guess theres nothing wrong with the song, and the kids would like it so i cant complain. I'd rate 10 out of 10."
3,Not a fan of honky tonk music,"I like Alan Jackson's voice, but I am not a fan of ""honky tonk"" music. I bought this CD for the song, ""The Angels Cried"", because it is beautiful duet with Alison Krauss; I also like ""Holly Jolly christmas"", because I like that old standard (remember Burl Ives?); and ""If We Make It Through December"", not that I like it that well, but I got used to hearing Merle Haggard sing it years ago. ""Santa's Gonna Come In A Pickup Truck"" is a cute Alvin & the Chipmunks project, but not my style; ""A New Kid In Town"" is easy on the ears, but not particularly endearing. If you love Alan Jackson, you may be totally satisfied with this CD."
4,A great holiday album,This album is such great fun. I am an Alan Jackson fan and had to add this one to my collection. This is my second purchase of this album as my first simply vanished and I found Christmas without it just wasn't the same.There are some very jolly up beat tracks to get you in the Christmas spirit.I love it! Recommended
3,Nothing special,This was a Ok album but nothing special . To me the best song on it was Daddy Please don't get Drunk This Christmas . and that was nothing special . It is not the Alan Jackson I am so used to or it could be I was spoiled by the Toby Keith Christmas to Christmas which I did enjoy very much .
4,If your a Fan Get It!,"If your a fan of Spaghetti Westerns. If you think that The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a 10. Then here's a box set of 8 & 9 n's."
2,sloppy,"This book covers a lot of interesting information, but it reads like a hastily-written undergraduate thesis, with disjointed quotes and unsupported conclusions. Some of the quotes are interesting, but the quality of the writing and analysis makes it an unsatisfying read. The Roy Moxham book is much better."
2,High Fructose Corn Syrup,"I think a name like ""Nature Valley"" is misleading, considering there are several unnatural ingredients in these granola bars (like high fructose corn syrup).They taste fine, they sustain - but they're not healthy or natural."
1,"SUgar, High Fructose, Sweetener Bar","Ok, so ingredients #2, #4, #5, #6, and #7 are all some type of sweetener. And we think these are a ""healthy"" snack? It's really not that hard. People, please wake up!"
2,Series just keeps getting worse...,No energy at all in Rauhofer's song selection. The repetition hypnotizes you into a deep slumber. It really feels like he has decided he can sell anything just by putting his once leading name in awesome dance music on anything. Track times:CD1:1. enlightenment (7:02)2. Rany days (6:43)3.

4,"great video, but it's definitely the first","this video doesn't have the fun songs nor does it feel as put together as the later ones. Still, she loves to watch it and has learned to sign ""Cat"" and ""ball"", etc. from watching this. We love to have her watch these videos. I just wish they weren't so expensive so I could buy more of them!"
5,So fun to watch,I watched this with my 4 month old and we both loved it. The happy and fun feeling you get from this show is very catchy and so very perfect for me and my son. We're going to really enjoy learning the signs it provides in such a creative way.
4,Signing time,I really like this dvd. It was cute and very easy to follow. The only thing missing was the sign for diaper. I imagine it's on the second volume dvd. In any case it's very good.
5,Excellent learning video,"I am an interpreting student at a college for the Deaf, and I recently took on the task of teaching my hearing, two-year-old niece how to sign. Since I am not able to be around all of the time, I decided to purchase some videos to reinforce and enhance her aquisition of the language during my absence. This video, which is geared toward hearing children, has definitely been the best purchase in many respects. Most importantly, it does an excellent job of capturing, and holding, her attention. It also does a wonderful job of establishing the connection between words/concepts and their corresponding signs. The video is also great in regard to viewer participation. Signs are not presented strung together in confusing songs that are impossible for a child to imitate, as in many other children's signing videos. The signs are simply presented and then visually reinforced by other children in a way that encourages the child to follow along."
4,"Very good, but it could be a little better","I just got this video today and thought it was very easy to follow and entertaining for my 18 month old son. He's delayed in his speech and thought it would be good for him to learn some key words in sign language so he wouldn't be so frustrated. I was disappointed, though, at the fact that common signs, such as ""please"" and ""thank you"", were not included in the basic first video. I think that would have been more valuable to include, rather than ""car"", ""fish"", or ""airplane""...things he won't immediately need to sign. I also got volume 2, but haven't watched it yet... hopefully there will be more useful signs in that one."
3,"Good, but not enough new signs for interaction","I bought this DVD to teach my 9 month old sign language and was just expecting more signs to help in communication. The presentation of the signs is nice and repetitive, but I just expected more from it. I suppose that's why there's so many other volumes that they want you to buy."
5,best video to learn signing with your kids,"The Signing Time series is wonderful because it's fun and full of smiles and facial gestures that are totally lacking in other videos. Anyone who has seen sign in action knows that sign language has lots of facial gestures to help communicate what is being signed. This series not only has cute animation but the two children are delightful and so happy. The mother who signs is wonderful to watch and hear. The kids in our playgroup (we all have hearing children) really enjoy watching the videos and learn SO QUICKLY (especially if they are over 12 mos. old). I would and DO recommend this as your first video to learn sign language, children OR adults.The only criticism I have with the video (and others) is why do they have to teach the sign for ""cookie"" to children!?! I can't tell you how quickly my son picked THAT one up, much to my chagrin. ;)"
