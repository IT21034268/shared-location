3,I thought the plot and many of the characters thin .,"I thought the plot and many of the characters thin in this unusual tale of an obeese murdereress. I felt many of the characters were designed as plot devices to fill holes in the plot. Some of the actions of the characters such as the sculptress's attorney were totally unbelieveable except for this reason. The ending of the book - who actually did the crime - was quite unsatisfying. This character by nature, gave the author permission not to fully explain motives and actions that had transpired in the story."
3,"Not as good as ""Gimmie Fiction""","After the phanominal Gimmie Fiction, I expected this to be just as good. But I'm a bit disappointed honestly, I think they've made it a little too accessible (I'm not saying they sold out either). In making their music more straightforward, it feels like it's missing some of what made gimmie fiction so unique. Now, it's still way better than most music out there these days, and it still sounds like a spoon record. I just don't think it measures up to the standards of their previous records. I'm sorry about being a party crasher, but I'm just giving my honest opinion."
3,GaGaGaGaGa....,A couple of tracks just sounded like noise and didn't fit with the rest of the album. But I would say at least half of the album contained tracks that I consider typical Spoon songs. I like Spoon for their sound as they have a unique sound.
3,I don't love it.,"I'm suprised as Gimme Fiction was incredible. I have never been one to harp on the past when I'm gifted new material by one of my favorite groups, but for those who say that this is as good or better than Gimme fiction - have you heard Gimme Fiction.Listening to GaX5 makes me want to hear The beast and dragon adored, My mathematical mind, I summon you, I turn my camera on, They never got you, Sister jack (I'll stop).I get that the sound and content was stripped down on purpose while they get their groove on - and they do, but this album sounds like it came before not after Fiction."
2,No Rock and Roll sensibility,"I agree with Black Griffin. And I know that Pitchfork gave this album an 8.5 out of 10. And I know that they called this album a ""grower"". And I know that that implies that those of us who ""don't get it"" will be called shortsighted and unfeeling ignoramuses. But there's not much to this album. Nothing has the Rock and Roll energy on this record that is found on ""Gimmie Fiction"", ""Kill the Moonlight"", or ""Series of Sneaks"". But maybe that's what they were going for... Maybe their idea of becoming more experimental this year means lilting around on half hearted riffs and singing words that are entirely replacable over and over again. If that's the case, then yes, this album is experimental, but I hope that for their next release they get back their Rock and Roll sensibility and put out something Good."
4,Top Five of Oh Seven,"I've played this as much, if not more, than any music that I bought in 2007.Very catchy without being cliche."
2,Should have called it wawawa,I first came accross Spoon on MySpace and really liked some of their sounds. I did a search on amazon and didn't sample any of it first just went with my gut because the earlier stuff I'd heard was so good. Big mistake. This is a good band. The cd left me flat. I was disappointed. All the songs seem to blend together which bummed me out because some of the other stuff I'd heard from them was amazing.
3,Completely Boring,"If you're just now starting to get in to Spoon, then by all means check out this album. It might sound new, strange, and yet brilliant all at the same time to you few folks who haven't indulged in the brilliance that is Kill the Moonlight, or Gimme Fiction. But Spoon's newest album, Ga Ga Ga Ga is one of the most boring albums I've ever listened to. It seems like Spoon got tired of coming up with melodies so they stuck with the idea of a few throughout. Perhaps Kathleen C. Fennessy finds this bold move as Beatlesesque, but few Beatles fans would agree. The critics failed to notice Kill the Moonlight and Gimme Fiction, so they decided to give Spoon the win with Ga Ga Ga Ga. Or at least that's my opinion, have a listen and decide for yourself."
2,I don't get it,"I am, have been, the biggest Spoon fan ever, and rate ""Girls Can Tell"", ""Kill the Moonlight"", and especially ""Gimme Fiction"" as among some of the best rock albums ever. In fact, I've frequently said that Spoon is doing what the Beatles would be doing if they were still together. So I've only listened to this a couple of times, but it's not hitting me--and I've heard the songs before because I've seen Spoon recently--and awesomely--in concert a couple of times. But this sounds like Spoon ""lite"" or a band trying to be Spoon but doesn't have the spark. Where is the contrapuntal energy of ""I Turn My Camera On?"" Where is the hookiness of, well, almost everything else? I looked forward to this album for so long, but now I just feel ga, ga, ga, ga, ga about it."
2,Where's the Spoon of old?,"With success from songs such as ""The Way We Get By"" and ""I Turn My Camera On"", Spoon has decided to take the pop route. I liked it in small doses but not for an entire album. It felt like this album could be played to any given episode of the O.C. How unfortunate that the band that gave us gems like ""Lines in the Suit"" and ""Change My Life"" would resort to cheap commercialism. I can't wait to count how many of these songs will soon be in commercials for cars, cola, jeans, etc..."
2,Wish I Hadn't Bought This One,"I'm a huge Spoon fan, and I own all their albums. Based upon their track record, I bought this as soon as I came across it at a record store.Boy do I wish I'd given it a listen first.There are a lot of reviews here which are full of flowery prose, but here's the lowdown: this album does not live up to the standard set by prior Spoon albums."
4,Not as good as Moonlight.......but masterful in the technique,"They have the indie sound down. One reviewer mentioned Lo Fi....that's stating it mildly. It's as if they have a production shield that protects them from all things glossy and slick, the band never fails to deliver. Straight ahead tunes, and a mountain of energy=GaGa......Check out the new Poi Dog Pondering CD.....a creative blend of all things...yet unique"
5,*drool* one of their better albums,"I Love Spoon. There we go simple as that. This album sounds different than their previous ones, however it's still one of my favorites. It's one of those albums, you can just listen to through and through. I have to say, kill the moonlight is my favorite, but this one is pretty close. I love the song, ""my little japanese cigarette case"" so random, but so fun. For any fan, a Must Buy. For newbies, a good place to start."
5,Spy at its finest,"For anyone who had to read any of those dreadful 1980's ""voice of his/her generation"" books, and I find it hard to believe that anyone ever read any of them voluntarily, this sendup is a must. This sort of satire is what made the old Spy great."
3,1001 Things to Spot on the Farm,I was disappointed because it is paperback. The other one of this title is hardbound as is the 1001 Animals to Spot.
2,Unfortunate Packaging,"As with the Simpson's unfortunate ""head"" packaging gimmicks, there ought to be an option with Northern Exposure to opt out of the cutsie packaging and just go with a box. There are some of us out here who are interested in the content of what is offered - but completely disinterested in the ""novelty"" packaging that is more of a nuisance than a drawing point. What were the marketing people thinking?It would be wonderful if, like the Simpson's products so inconveniently packaged, there was an option for a simple box."
4,Great but a few glitches.,"I havent't watched all of the DVD's yet but what I have watched is great except for side 2 of disk 1, 1st year. There is a glitch on the disk and it stalls and refuses to proceed without skipping ahead consequently missing part of the story. Another annoyance, at the very beginning of disk one, year one, there is advertising for other DVD's and it seems to be impossible to fast forward or skip these so one has to watch the ads whether one choosed to or not. In year two it seems that one disk only has one story instead of two on side two of I think disk two. That was a surprise.Northern Exposure has always been one of my favorite programs and I am enjoyng watching the episodes again. Would be much better without the glitches."
4,Northern Exposure,"Without a doubt, the best T.V. program of the 1990's. However, purchasers should know that the first two years in this set of DVD's consist of only six or seven episodes rather than the normal 13 or 14 per year since that's all they produced the first two years. This does not detract from this incredibly great program."
5,Missed most of these on air,"Money well spent. I missed most of the aired episodes, so they were fresh. I loved every minute, and NO COMMERCIALS!"
4,My First LCD,"I'm a gamer and always thought that CRT was the way to go for gaming, but after taking the jump up to the VP201b, it changed my way of thinking. The colors are bright and really stand out, there's no ghosting at all in gaming, and there's no dead pixels.I highly recommend this monitor. The only problem that I have is the fact that I didn't realize that with it's aspect ratio, the monitor recommends that you use a 1600X1200 resolution and if you use anything else, the picture quality isn't as good while web browsing, however it's great for gaming. I'm getting used to browsing with it though."
3,Not a Gaming Monitor,"I bought this monitor because reviews I had read said it was the first flat panel that could display FPS games without ghosting or blurring. But it does both. Simply moving the cursor slowly across the screen will blur it, not to mention the background in games blurs badly during movement. As a text and static graphic-only monitor it is beautiful, but don't expect it to display games anywhere near as well as a CRT costing half as much."
5,great monitor no problems,"I recently purchased this monitor and it was everything I hoped it would be. No stuck pixels or other problems. Looks better than my friend's 20"" UltraSharp Dell. Can't wait to buy another one. Little pricey though."
3,"over-priced book, best to hunt around.","Book is okay, but is not enough to give you consolation when grieving for a dear friend, and the the book is way over-priced for what's its worth and sold almost anywhere, but you can buy the item for $5.95 as what the real cost of this book should be from the author or publisher. Sellers, please be fair with your pricing!"
3,Get the three track enhanced version,"Good little single if you get the 4 track version.The title track is well known to many, one of the better songs off of on and on.No other way is a gentle acoustic version which is a nice listenButter nut is an instrumental from a surf movie which is very much what you would expect from an instrumental soundtrack, very beachy and chilled.Also thrown in is the live good people video which is good to rip into an mp3 also.Great single just make sure to get the 4 track enhanced version."
4,Regarding The Book Today,"I had been familiar with the 12 step program through Alcoholics Anonymous.""Today"" is an uplifting daily meditation book that could benefit all walks of life. This book is affiliated with Emotions Anonymous. Emotions are something we all have to use or abuse and reading these uplifting thoughts everyday have been very helpful. Thank you EA people!!"
5,Hurry Up This Way Again/Closer Than Close/1982,I'm a huge Stylistics fan and could not believe my eyes when i saw that these 3 rare albums were available at one time on cd....There are a lot of good lesser known tracks as well as the one's you know and love....I'd have to put the Stylistics in my top 5 groups of all times....I'm sure you'll enjoy this 3 lp set on 2 cd's....Heres to good music
1,To be honest average,"Great music is all about the hook, whether it's Van Halen or Brittney Spears I better be signing and playing air guitar as I drive down the road listening to an artist.While Shake Down Cruise is a great tune, loved it in 79 and love it now,the rest of the album left me flat. Not to much more to say about, sorry."
4,Good product for the price,"It works as expected, quality is not the best but it's ok if you are going to use the tool ocasionally only on your own car."
4,They never understood your songs.,"It's not quite rock, it's not quite country, not quite lounge - it's unique. It's Lee Hazlewood, that's what it is. This two CD set contains all his recordings for MGM. That includes three albums; ""The Very Special World of Lee Hazlewood"", ""Lee Hazlewoodism, Its Cause and Cure"" and the never released in the US ""Something Special"", plus a few non-LP songs. A couple of unreleased songs have been lost and are not included here, including the intriguingly titled ""The Lone Ranger Ain't My Friend Anymore"". The first two albums are similar in arrangement to the albums Lee produced for Nancy Sinatra, including several of the same songs. ""Something Special"" is something altogether different, with a jazzy four piece band and scat singing by Billy Strange. If you like music Hazlewood produced for Nancy Sinatra, give the music he released under his own name a listen."
1,I agree with review of JL Ennis,"One of the worst books I've bought. Besides the story being eye-rolling bad, please don't write about something you know nothing about. I've been in law enforcement for 15 years and I cringed each time the heroine did something stupid (too stupid to live, I kept thinking). I was wishing the bullet had been a little higher and to the left.And one more thing, a note to the author: please buy a thesaurus! After the umpteenth time someone ""ambled"" or ""sauntered"" somewhere, I was grinding my teeth. Those are the only two ways anybody in the book moved from place to place."
2,"Not one for my ""keeper"" shelf...","This book left me thinking ""pu-leeze"" for most of it. OK, a book should have a little stretching of the truth, suspense of reality, but this one is waaay out there. I think the most irritating thing (to me at least) was the way the heroine was supposed to be hiding out, protecting her life by hiding her law-enforcement background and yet she was always spouting off that she was DEA to people; people who, by the way, didn't believe her until she assaulted them. They probably shouldn't have believed her, either, since she had no documentation and produced no proof she was on the right side of the law.The story was interesting enough for me to read the whole thing, but take this with a grain of salt. I also finish the ingredients list on the kids' cereal boxes.Definately far below Kensington/Brava's usual standards."
4,"A very fast, enjoyable read...","When all of the sex died down, and it was very well written, this book was very good. I just wish it was longer than 237 pages. Can't wait for Ms. Kelley's next book."
2,Not So Comforting,"I had my eye on this book for a few weeks while I browsed around at Barnes and Noble. Finally I broke down and bought it. Big mistake! I found the plot to be completely unbelievable, and repetitive. As I was reading it, I found that certain details just seemed to ""happen"" instead of giving enough background information to support it. This book was based more on the love affair between Fallon and Wade then it did the actual point of their characters. I did not find the plot to be relatable or the characters for that matter. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you are looking for a good plot."
2,Picture and description misleading,"Not a terrible product, clever enough design, but I was disappointed that it did not come with the carrying mentioned in the description and displayed in the second photo. Looking at the product description on my phone(which is where I do most of my ordering from), the first line of Product Features is ""16oz thermal bottle and carrying case."" When I look at the product from my laptop, it doesn't mention it, though it is still pictured. I bought this for my hunting husband, and without the case it will be a little more cumbersome for him to carry along with his gear."
2,Novelty item,"This is just a fun novelty item. It does not work as well as other products for its intended purpose. I have tried to keep hot beverage, but the spout system is flimsy and I have to unscrew that portion to pour onto a cup if I really want to use it.It came with a carrying pouch, but it is very thin and it may serve its purpose for light duty use."
5,Great,Very good Christmas gift for your friends who have and really enjoy THIER guns.nice novelty and it works for your favorite beverage
5,thank you,"Thank you very much, it was the perfect gift for my son the hunter, he uses it a lot. Thank you"
3,floppy,"My son likes this costume as he is a HUGE Cars fan. However, it is not stiff enough and doesn't keep its shape. Even my 5 year old is upset that it looks caved in. We may sew in a plastic bar in the back to keep it straight. What a pain for paying that much."
3,Where is the love?,"Sentence-for-sentence, this is talented writing. However, when you string it all together, there is one sad conclusion: not one of these characters is lovable, much less likable. As such, why read the novel beyond the first couple of chapters, because there is absolutely nobody to root for, and certainly nobody I identify with in any way. As I got deeper into this novel, it became increasingly difficult to turn the pages. I read it to the end more out of a sense of duty than anything else, because I try to finish books I've started."
2,Ending problems,"I had the same problem as many others. The first 3/4s of the book were excellent, but the ending was very frustrating and unsatisfying."
4,"A very fine book about the campaign v. the Commies during WWII. I am not into Degrelle personal/political views, yet nonetheless","This is a very good book that was firstpublished in Spanish in the early Fifties,where Degrelle (Spain) died in early 1994.Great writing and some even US(!) militaryschools had their students read this account!Must have been before Political Stupidity setin! A must read for anybody even remotely in-terested in the 'Eastern Front' of ETO duringthe period! I do not agree with Leon's poli-tics though. I am a Revisionist of the far middlepolitically!"
3,Different view.....,"Out of all the first person accounts of the Eastern front, this one comes across very differently. Degrelle is a infamous charater of that time, and is Anti-Soviet/Pro-Nazi slant is evident to the reader. The story is a worthy one for the experienced reader, yet way to complex for the casual WWII fan. The discriptions, while not as good as others (ex. Sajer, Gottlieb)tells a vivid story. The Wallonian's seemed to be in the think of many decisive battles in the war and the book shows this very clearly. It also shows in graphic detail the savage and brutal nature of war in the East."
3,A survivor's personal account,"A Belgian supporter of NAZI Germany tells of his personal experiences (grisly/racial/tactical) in an all volunteer Belgian SS unit which seemingly never committed atrocities gainst civilians, prisoners or the Russian troops. One cannot help but feel some facts were omitted to fit the agenda of this unrepentant NAZI-in-exile in Spain.Published by ""The Institute for Historical Review&quot"
3,Plenty of action but very hard to believe,The story revolves around a plot to kidnap Enrico Fermi from his lab at the University of Chicago.The book starts out quite good but as all the plot elements come together the story becomesvery hard to believe. The actions and assumptions of the characters begin to lose credibility as the storyprogresses.The book is well written - the story flows nicely and there is plenty of action.
5,Remembering a Legend,"I bought this set although Ive had Oliver for years on LP;the bare essence of the matter is that King Oliver is one of the most criminally neglected creative minds in jazz history,-while not to fault Louis Armstrong's greatness,he is given far too much credit for these recordings,when it is in fact Oliver who is the major element in the magic of this splendid ensemble.With the wonder of CD technology now Oliver's legacy can be preserved in the new millenium. Like Jelly Roll Morton Joe Oliver was a genius and this stupendous set will convince anyone who has an ear. The historians are wrong - these are Olivers finest hour, Enjoy!"
3,King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band: The Complete Set,"The rhythm banjo drowns out the horns during the first 28 cuts. Cuts 29 thru 41 are much better in that regard. Cuts 40 and 41 are especially good in that we are able to hear King Oliver solo. Louis Armstrong shows us that he can be an ensemble player. He also shows us that he can play a slide whistle too. This CD is a compendium of some of the classic jazz tunes of the era. If one is an arranger, this disc could serve as a foundation illustrating how these tunes sound when played straight."
2,Same old same old...,"There's really nothing much here that hasn't been reissued previously again and again and again. All these Oliver sets sound like they're derived from the same sources and just recycled by different labels. These are dull, bland sounding transfers. The only thing this set has going for it is that it's ""complete"". Otherwise, it doesn't make for very satisfying listening."
3,"Not bad, but...","This stuff is not bad, especially considering it's historical interest. Due to the poor and crude technology of the time at the infamous Gwinnett Studios in Hammond, Indiana one of the Dodds Brothers was forced to substitute blocks for a drum set. ""Chimes Blues"" (Satch's debut) has a quirly appeal and ""Dippermotuh Blues "" (later known as ""Sugarfoot Stomp"") if fun where one of the CJB shouts, ""OH PLAY THAT THING!"" While this is good, the best recorded jazz from this era was captured on Satch's Hot 5 and Hot 7 recordings."
4,Hot Harmonica!!,"Here's a nice reissue of an important Country boogie artist. Not only is Waney's playing and singing enjoyable, check out the sidemen on these King recordings, including the Delmore Brothers and Merle Travis. Nice notes are included as well. This hot post-War hillbilly music and deserves a place in all country collections."
5,Bossa Nova Doesn't Get Any Better,"If you're looking for a simple, beautiful record of one man and his guitar, you won't find anything better than this. Such a warm intimate sound--- perfect for a summer night with someone you love."
1,Just Doesn't Make It,South Beach helped me the most. The Atkins books give a tremendous amount of information. Dr. Phil provides good insights. Stick with any of these and you can't go wrong.
1,Atkins Wannabe,"This book is a poor attempt to use the good Atkins name to appear to be related with a true diet genius. I was surprised when I read that Markham was not only NOT affiliated with Atkins, but Markham had no academic credentials to write this book.Chiropractors, who I don't trust, believe that they are experts at everything while they don't even like to mention that they are only chiropractors. Real doctors have MDs after their names and aren't ashamed to use those initials. Markham, like most chiropractors must be really insecure. Since they are trained to straighten backs, for whatever that is worth, it makes sense.Markham lists a bunch of brands that he says he likes. Paid endoresements are not very useful.Aurora said that Markham's bungee was cheap enough when better and more versatile units are sold at Big 5 and other stores for much less. Is Aurora really Markham like Persnickety is?If Atkins wasn't the real thing then Markham would not have used his name in the title!"
3,Not my favorite of the Four,"This book is 1 of a series of 4 and to get a feel of the series which as a whole is excellent, you probably need to read it, but it just isn't my favorite of the four. It's based on the nicest of the 4 brothers and you see him again in another series which I won't tell you about...but all in all, it introduces you to Silas, to prepare you for the greater things he does later on down the road...or in the series. Lori Wick is one of the best Christian writers out there. You won't miss by reading her indivial books or her series."
3,Basic Predictable Love Story,This book is a light Christian romance novel set in Wisconsin in the 1800s. It was about two friends developing romantic feelings for each other and the struggle they went through as they saw their relationship changing. The girl also struggled with whether to stay and take care of her father or get married and move out.This is an enjoyable read if you want something light and easy. It is a nice little story.
2,"A real let-down, considering the original.","This book was a MAJOR let-down from its predecessor, ""A Place Called Home."" I barely got through reading it. All of the characters that were so full of life in the original have now become flat, dull, and uninteresting people. The story line plods along VERY VERY slowly, once in a while stopping dead in its tracks to have a printout of a couple of Bible chapters to take up space. Good storyline, mediocre book."
2,pedestrian,"the other books in this series are very good (4 to 5 stars). however, this one slipped into the mediocre rut that affects many sequels or prequels."
1,Pedestrian and Mediocre,What could have been an exciting sequel just sinks into a real mediocre blah. It's so formula it could be pablum. OK as sophomoric english exercise but not as art.
5,Chaos made understandable - at last.,"In a world where every day we see more clearly that the simple notion of a global world mandates a process that accounts for the chaos and complexity, Sanders has managed to translate science well enough so that global managers and local grass roots folks alike can understand and make sense of out of whats happening. More than that, the time she has taken to distill the theory and suggest a structure for incorporating chaos and complexity into strategic thinking will save me six years of reading and research. Bravo!"
3,"The end to a great leader, the begining of a legend",This book gives the reader a new interesting look about Martin luther king Jr. It was amazing to me how the athour could tell the story as if Martin himself was telling his own story. I think everyone should at lease check it out for themself and all who really don't know him can have some knolege about his life time.
5,If Nothing Else,"This book should be must reading (or in my case listening) for all Americans. The threads of a single man's search for freedom for all are woven in a tapestry of the times he lived with powerful choices of recorded speeches.I had two of my daughters listen to his reading of his letter from the Birmingham jail and the conversation that followed enriched all of us. Current ""Black Leaders"" would do well to seek inspiration from his words and recall a time when the motivating factors were the need for freedom, justice and equality independant of financial desires other than the monies needed to accomplish the task at hand. His views of Malcolm X were also well laid out and deserve attention beyond the hollywood version.If you weren't black then, sympathy is easy but empathy requires study ... this book goes a long way."
4,Really Enjoyed Reading the Book,I really enjoyed reading this book. The style of prose used by Dr. King is very easy to follow and flows very well. The book is also an inspiring example of how civil disobedience can change the world.I also am glad that he did not sneeze. (If you read the book you will know the context of this statement).The only reason that I did not give the book a 5 star rating is I thought that the editor could have added an addendum or chapter on the end of the book concerning the assassination of Dr King and how this affected the rest of the Civil Rights movement and the rest of the country as a whole.But I would definetely recommend this book.
4,Rachel Suh,"I personally do not like to read any sort of autobiographies or biographies but this book was different. This book is supposed to be the autobiography of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. by Clayborne Carson, who did a extensive amount of research. I was very pleased that he included alot of original and personal documents of Dr. King. This book lets the readers put on Dr. King's mask and see for themselves what it might have been for him on a more personal level. I found this book very interestingly touching and I recommend it to anyone intrested in Dr. King's life, his works or his philosophy."
5,MLK Brilliant and Consummate Christian,I was overwhelmed by King's christian ethic and his brilliance. This was an outstanding page turner from cover to cover. King showed us what true christianity and commitment are. I recommend it to all.
4,review of historical book,"This book provides a good review for those who lived through those turbulent years. The only downside is that it is quite sanitized, downplaying the real horrors experienced by those seeking civil rights including Dr. King."
2,"Poorly written, don't waste your time.","It is sad that Martin Luther King Jr.'s name is even associated with this book. Carson has the writing ability of a middle schooler and it leads to a lack luster view of MLK's achievements. The only thing that saves this book from being a complete work of destruction is the direct reference to MLK's speechs.Not recommended at all. If you want the real story about one of the most influential people in history, read MLK's autobiography."
4,A fountain of inspiration,"""A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus."" -Martin Luther King, Jr.Truly one of the greatest leaders of all time, this book captures the life of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the pivotal moments that shaped his life and the lives of people who have been blessed to witness his life journey. Although the book is in an autobiography format, the narrative of his life is actually derived from the King's public and personal papers. His legacy is truly remarkable and anyone who would read this would take away a lot of life lessons that would inspire one to be the kind of leader he was."
3,more like a biography than an autobiography,"this is a good book if you want to know general info about martin luther king and what he stood for. if you want to really know the impetus behind his movements and get a more incisive look into his ideology i urge you to read ""the essential writings and speeches of mlk"" and also all of his books a ""stride towards freedom"", ""where do we go from here community or chaos"", ""strength to love"" and others.this book is more of a combination of the editors words and martins words. you dont really get an intimate look into who mlk really was or any of his movements. its a good start for people who arent to familiar with dr. king but i strongly encourage you not to stop here read every book and speech the man wrote to get a better understanding of dr. king"
4,Learning About Non-Violence,"Not very many great people get the chance to write their own Autobiography. I like hearing the stories directly from the man himself. I listened to the audio recording of the book which included the actual audio recordings from many of his speeches. I would recommend that to anyone. The book is well written and follows Martin Luther King, Jr on his journey of civil rights and peace. The theme of the book seemed to be non-violence. A great read for anyone who wants to learn about that movement or about why it was so successful."
3,My favorite OverKill,"Even though Decay seems to be the most popular OverKill release, I like the older stuff with Rat Skates better. This CD is great because it includes the ""rare"" EP plus the classic Feel The Fire album. I think this is a must-have for any OverKill fan."
2,"Great film, junk transfer","I was moved by the scenes from Pyaasa that can be viewed on the web. Based on that, and other reviews, I bought this DVD in hopes that it would be much better quality than the low resolution video captures on the web. No such luck. If you want to see the quality of this transfer from film to DVD, the web pieces are as good as it gets. The film is cluttered with debris and old fashioned splices in the middle of a scene. The video contrast is awful. The images are too often greyed out, with no contrast, or experiments in abstract black and white. The sound is low-fi midrange; no bass, no treble. With such an excellent film industry, India should have something like the Library of Congress restoration project as in the U.S. Pyaasa is moving, the music wonderful, the acting heart-wrenching, but this transfer is tragically inferior."
5,The Closing of the Western Mind:The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason,"Reading this is as if you are sitting in the midst of a fire works show, getting jolts of reality and sparks of new ideas that stretches the horizons of the mind."
4,Complementary readings to Freeman's interesting book,"There are already many good reviews to this book, so I will only suggest reading the following books on religion in addition to Freeman's: a) ""The Phenomenon of Religion: A Thematic Approach,"" by Moojan Momen (astonishingly encyclopedic); b) ""Shamans, Sorcerers, and Saints: A Prehistory of Religion"" by Brian Hayden (great overview of religion origins and development); c) ""Life after Death. A History of the afterlife in Western Religion"" by Alan F. Segal; d) ""Alternative Tradition: A Study of Unbelief in the Ancient World (Religion and Society)"" by James A. Thrower; e) ""How to Read the Bible: A Guide to Scripture, Then and Now"" by James L. Kugel; and f) ""Augustine of Hippo: A Biography"" by Peter Brown."
1,Response to Mr. Freeman,"Mr. Freeman's response posted here is no more than extended Renaissance and Enlightenment sophistry if not out and out bad will against Christianity and specifically the Catholic Church and Catholic Tradition. So this has all been argued before and in spite of the mischief caused over the centuries, it doesn't seem to ever deliver a knock out punch as is perhaps desired. Pope John Paul II's encyclical, Faith And Reason, alone, trumps Mr. Freeman's thesis. And, by the way, with the election of Benedict XVI (Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger), you will see even more examples of the marriage of faith and reason, faith and art, faith and education."
3,Good attempt,"A good attempt by Charles Freeman. But he falls into the trendy trap of overly elevating the Arabic contribution to rationalism and Greek thought. Greek thought continued amongst the Greeks longer than Proclus. Although there were intermittent breaks the Byzantine Greeks continued to think like Greeks in the guise of Philopponus, Psellus and Italos. And then the late humanist flowering that included Gregoras, Metochites, Chamounos and many more. And finally the great Plethon. Although, they were definitely not as original as their ancient forebears they did think rationally. And he forgets to mention that the Caliphs eventually put a stop to Arabic falsifah (philosophy)."
4,I am a late bloomer!,"I've always loved history, but it's been only in the last decade or so, that I've also taken up the history of the Christian religion. Born and raised Roman Catholic, I've always questioned much of the dogma in the church. Freeman's research supports Eherman's studies on the New Testament. James Carroll's Constantine's Sword, like this book, should be required reading for those who desire to learn more about religion's impact on our ability and need to maintain our God-given curiosity and therefore, learn more about ourselves and life. It only took me 68 trips around the sun to get to where I am today - wish my curiosity on this subject would have come sooner!"
4,A feel-good trip into the past.,"A glorious b/w movie from the 1940's! Nothing ground-breaking, just another joyous trip down memory lane...a trip to a time when movies were fun, entertaining...not full of cursing, not loaded with gore and dismemberment...rather, full of smiles and good will. A wonderful film from the golden age of Hollywood!"
1,Nice TV show in VCD quality.,"I'm very happy if the Digi-Pack arrived today but the happiness was not long. I put in the first DVD and saw the catastrophe. The master of this show is good but the DVD-label made a very very poor encoding. Every scene with faster movements or explosions are blocking and pixeling like a bad VCD before 10 years. That's not the way to sell a very good action tv show.My own recordings from the german tv are better and has a Mbps of 5.000 or a little more in peaks. This original digi-pack has a Mbps of 3.500.Please ignore this bad quality digi-pack, so we can hope of a better release by a better label.The tv show self are a 5 stars action show in my opinion.In the future it will be better if more customers wrote about the dvd quality and not the quality of shows or films."
4,Great book!,"Hygeia Halfmon's ideas about mothering are enlightening. She speaks honestly and truthfully. Although I don't agree with all of her ideas, I found something useful in very chapter. the only thing I didn't like was that she seemed to be advertising her other books and books by other authors she recommended."
4,Cool Mama!,"I can't say that I agree with everything in the book (what a boring world if we all agreed!) but I love that she puts her children first, follows her mothering instincts, and that she busts the myth that you have to have lots of money and lots of products in order to have healthy, happy children. In my case, she's preaching to the choir, but I found it inspiring. That said, I really was bugged by all the plugs. Every time I saw bold print, I thought ""Here we go."" I realize she's both trying to make a living and a difference, but to me it messed up the flow of the book - stick a catalog at the end, and leave out the commercials. Still, a very good message - keep your babies close, eat well, and follow your bliss."
1,Not my favorite,"I'm an AP'er, homebirther, extended breastfeeder, etc and i thought I'd love this book but i did not! Although I agree with Hygeia's belief that mothers must be with their children, I don't think its the job of the govt to see that this can happen. Its up to us as enterprising parents to make it happen. Taking hand outs is not the example that I want my child to see. She recommends in her chapter on going to a raw food diet fasting your babies!! She suggests that we not feed our babies in order to cleanse their systems!! I was shocked! Its one thing to choose a radical lifestyle for yourself but to impose this on your child, when it may not be the healthiest choice is wrong in my opinion.This book really turned me off. I found her to be way to proud of what she is doing and rather judgemental in tone towards those who choose differently."
1,A horrible rip off,"In all honesty this third book felt rushed, like Tanith Lee was told to spit out another book solely for the monetary value and to heck with the quality. The Red Unicorn seemed to rip off parts and basic premise from the Wizard of Oz, Alice In Wonderland and the Labyrinth all in one fell swoop. Tanaqil behaves like an angsty, whiny teenager in response to her difficulties in life, a direct contrast to her behavior in the first two books. I was left at the end of the book with a raised eyebrow and had to confirm that yes this was the same author for the same series I had so dearly loved in the earlier books."
4,More or less peeve,"In a wonderful yet, oddly less satisfying end to this brilliant trilogy, love prevails without being spoken. Good for peeve. Sad for us. All I can think of is 'Spuff'!, it's over.Jenny L. Bates, author ""Opening Doors: an equilog of poetry about Donkeys"""
4,Good but too much Billy Murray,"Comic singer Billy Murray is over-represented on this album. The real treasure is ""Mean, Mean, Mamma"" by the Original Indiana Five. It's a terrific Hot Jazz song - so good that I've bought vol 1 of the Indiana Five album from Amazon. It's great!!"
4,Blast From the Past,"I enjoyed this music because it took me on a time travel journey to a time I had never experienced, but could enjoy vicariously.Great background music for a party."
1,JUST TERRIBLE,"I have a Dell xps with 1024 ram, windows XP pro and 120 GB. I installed musicmatch and it immediately disable my Nec 1100a DVD/CD read and write drive. I tried to enable the driver through my ""Device Manager"" (which showed the drive disable), and when I tried to I got error message that there was a program conflict and windows could not enable the drive. I sent a e-mail to tech support two days ago and still have not heard back.The only other product I have that uses the drive is Roxio 7.I have uninstalled musicmatch and used the windows ""restore"" to get my computer back to where it should be with my NEC 1100a DvD/CD--R/RW drive working just fine.My advice is to stay away from this product because of conflicts that may arise with other programs and the piss-poor tech support !!!!!!"
3,Still does what I want it to...,"I haven't had the problem a lot of reviewers are mentioning (dropping certain features) and I don't know why. I do get the upgrade pop-up at boot-up, but it doesn't bother me much. I just choose no. I do this because the later version doesn't do what version 8 does. I will continue to look into future upgrades, but will procede with caution. The only problem I'm having is that it no longer recogizes my internet connection. It also runs at a snail's pace. Other than that, it still does what I want it to do."
5,Great Product,"I reviewed a whole bunch of Music Managers and this was the best one. You can rip and Burn Cd's, or load up many MP3 models out there. You can also use the MusicMatch service to download song legally for .99 per song! (No monthly fee) A bunch of my friends have and it works great, no burner problems. If you are buying it as a gift, buy it here on Amazon. However, I would download it from Muscimatch.com for free. If you like it, you can pay the additional fee to get the enhancements. (I.e. faster burner times)"
1,WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK,I got this program with my new PC and i have to say it is extremly frustrating to work with musicmatch. It is userunfriendly and cheap. I gave finally up and go and buy a new program. I really regret that i wasted my time so far to work with it. Dont waste your money and time this program.No wonder that so many people gave it only one star
4,Version 8.2,"I've got Version 8.2 and have had none of the problems mentioned in previous reviews. I've tried all the big names (itunes, napster, realjukebox, windows media player) and this is my software of choice.Faster rip & burn than the others makes it #1 with me!!"
2,"Used to be weird, now its fine!",Modification now that I've downloaded version 10. I'd give it 4 stars but I can't change my rating in editing my old review.Works fine! I upgraded to the full featured version for better ripping and burning speeds and am happy. They fixed the CPU hogging problem and though the interface is a little different from that used in Windows and Realplayer and it doesn't do video or sound editing (where you can edit your tracks - try RipEditBurn if you need that) MusicMatch is now my preferred player and ripper-burner. I used to use RealPlayer but Realplayer corrupts their own music database and seems to take forever and use up gobs of CPU to do simple things.Version 9: was barely ok. Try free download of version 10 now - much better.
1,Does not work with all Dell computers,"I have a Dell XPS with a CDRW and DVD+RAM. The system is working perfectly, but when I install MusicMatch 8 Pro is disables my DVD. Dell support got it working by restoring the system back to right before I installed MusicMatch. Tech support did notrespond to my help request from their online website."
1,Do Not Buy This Product!!!,"On September 29, 2003 Musicmatch released version 8.1 of their product and in December, 2003 they released version 8.2. The retail box says ""New V8"" and it turns out it's 8.00.010 which is two levels behind. Even though you just bought the software Musicmatch wants an additional fee to get to the current level (8.2) of Jukebox Plus! You can get the current Jukebox Plus level by loading the Jukebox Basic for free from the Musicmatch website and then paying the upgrade to Jukebox Plus (and you'd be at the current level instead of two levels back). So don't waste $29.99 for the retail version!"
1,Features expire unlees you pay more money,"I was very disappointed to find that some of the nice features such as supertagging expire. You don't really buy this product, you lease it. This is a nasty practice that was abandoned years ago by reputable software developers. Don't buy it unless you are willing to pay over and over again for the same features."
2,Angry ...yearly renewal required,"I've had version 8 for several years. Now, I tried to change a filename and it WON'T LET ME unless I buy an upgrade! Nor will it ""tag"" files. This is inexcusable. A yearly renewal is required??? This WAS NOT the policy when I purchased the software. Unless you want to renew your ""subscription"" (this can no longer be considered a purchase), most of your ""plus"" features will expire. I'm ticked off. Good product, BAD policy."
1,This is NOT the costume you expect it will be....,"By looking at the cute picture, you expect to receive the costume as shown on the little child (cute and sweet as can be); however, when you actually receive the costume, it will be entirely different. The arms and legs are not ""spandex"" material as it appears - it's all fleece, and not nearly as cute. Do a web search for the squirt costume and you'll find the fleece one out there. I ordered it and they refused to give me a full refund, even though it was clear misrepresentation. I had to pay a restocking fee. I highly recommend looking elsewhere."
5,Perfectly performed rare opera,"I have spent the last year hoping it would be released as a DVD. The singing, especially the trio in the 2nd act, is incredible. Just incredible. Hope it gets to reach a wider audience and receive the acclaim it truly deserves."
2,Mary Zimmerman's Stupid Staging,"Lots and lots of beautiful music, as other reviewers describe in detail. Some also describe Mary Zimmerman's poor staging, but I was so disgusted I had to issue a warning:Amateur Night at the Met.Costumes and sets are crude, clumsy, cheap looking, and ugly, ugly, ugly. Staging is awkward, arch and trying to be clever when it is simply stupid.Opera fans are used to poor productions, but this one is an especially pretentious disgrace.If I've exaggerated, maybe some readers can find it better than expected."
4,Fantastical,"It is very obvious why Renee Fleming revived this relatively obscure Rossini opera. It is a tour de force for the leading lady and Ms Fleming gives a bravura performance in the starring role. She is ably supported by the rest of the cast, especially Lawrence Brownlee as Rinaldo. While Armida is not a great opera, it is a very enjoyable. The Metropolitan Opera's whimsical minimalist staging of the opera emphasized the fantastical elements of the proceedings making it all the more entertaining. I especially liked the ending when Rinaldo is leaving the island and Armida is literally being pulled between a cherubic ""Love"" and a monstrous ""Vengeance."" All in all, this is great fun and I highly recommend it."
4,Great Recipes,My mother swore by the Purity Cookbook. I always remembered the great meals that were based on it's recipes. When I saw that it was again in print I had to get it. Great cookbook.
1,Horrible Product!,"In short, the 'auto-sleep' software accompanying this product crashed my system and has never worked. That feature is why I bought it. I spoke with Tech support and they assured me that no matter WHAT was wrong with the drive it had to be my system's fault. I've worked on a tech support hotline for pc's for over a year; these folks have no intention of assisting you in any way other than denying it's their product's fault. I'd encourage you to call Bafallo tech support and run this one past them before you buy this product. None of the packaged software (backup software and auto-off software) work. Buy a harddrive from a reputable dealer instead (Western Digital, Maxtor or FreeAgent/Maxtor)."
3,"Pretty good, but not the Satelllites' best","The Georgia Satellites' debut album was a surprise hit, rising to the top 5 and spawning the Billboard #2 single ""Keep Your Hands To Yourself"", but this 1988 follow-up went largely uinnoticed, peaking at #77 before sinking like a stone.And that's a shame, because there is some real feel-good rock n' roll here...raw, gritty hard rock a la Stones, and highlighted by the sleazy boogie of ""Mon Cheri"", and a tremendous high-octane cover of Ringo Starr's ""Don't Pass Me By"".But it must be said that ""Open All Night"" doesn't match the Satellites' debut album...most of the 11 songs are good, but too few of them are great. Dedicated Satellites fans will want it anyway, and it is certainly not a bad record, but more casual listeners will be much better served by the excellent career overview ""Let It Rock - Best Of The Georgia Satellites"".3 1/4 stars for this one. Good enough, but not a necessary purchase when such a fine compilation is available."
1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, THIS ONE IS A JOKE","I had great expectations for this book, but after flipping through it, I noticed something odd.., It is missing any info on the Deep Sea Diver set, not even one photo, as far as this book is concerned, it seems hasbro never made it.. the book also has many mistakes, and the price guide is a JOKE.. this book is a GIANT waste of money."
2,Book has a lot of errors,This Gi Joe book has a lot of errors. It's ok for certain things but not for others because of the errors...As a whole... Thumbsdown from me!
1,No Help,This book was no help in learning about California Laws regarding Employee Rights. It is a compilation of simple questions written to the LA Times by readers and minimalistic answers to them that are vague and could be answered using common sense with no background in law.
5,1st Edition MM for AD&D,The initial concept is still the best (in my book). Lots of fun and it brings back some great gaming memories.
3,O.K. episode,Not the greatest Bones episode. I like it when the gang's all together instead of video conference.
5,Astoundingly good show,"I've watched episodes of ""Bones"" on TNT and found it to be an astoundingly good show. Seeing the ones I've missed just completes the fun. A mix of whodunit, suspense and humor, wonderfully well written and casted. If the sight of really messed up corpses doesn't disturb you, this is a first-rate production. The interaction between Dr. Brennan (Bones, played by Emily Deschanel)) and Booth, her detective partner, is priceless. Dr. Sweets as a sort of loser psychologist (who does win, often enough), and every one of the other cast members are just great. For me it's a perfect mix of all the elements that make up an engaging show. The wealth of plot twists and great subplot ideas is amazing. I hope it never ends."
5,bones 4th season,I love this show it is cool if you like stuff like this if you do you should get it asap.
5,Bones DVD,"What's not to like? Bones & Booth...what can I say? Yanks in the UK. Field trip! Controversial topics like ""The He in the She"" and ""The Girl in the Mask"" adressing transgender and androgyny. Humor! ""The Double Death of the Dearly Departed."" Booth's private hell...""The Hero in the Hold."" And at last an episode, ""The End in the Beginning,"" where Booth and Brennan get together in true love, even if they are playing the parts of other people! And I loved the gathering of all the crew playing different parts too! This is one of my favorite ... well, I can't really say that because they are ALL favorites! I'm crazy about Bones, Booth, Angela, Hodgins, Cam, and all the squints! Everyone!!!! They really found a winning combination when they cast this show!"
3,Hesitation,"The dvd was delivered in a timely fashion as promised. Each episode has a hesitation in it. I have cleaned the dvd's with no luck in improving the hesitation. So, I guess there is a defect in the dvd."
5,season 4,I enjoy the series immensely. The DVD received was great quality and a good price. Can't wait for season 8&9 to come out.
1,Episodes missing,"I was incredibly disappointed that this set did not include the first four episodes of the season. ""Yanks in the UK"" was a great two-episode show and one of my reasons for buying the set. Nowhere on the packaging did it indicate these episodes would be omitted. I think I'm owed another disc or a partial refund or something. I was totally cheated."
3,"Love the show, but why pay when FOX.com has it for free?",Bones is a great show if you are not the type that can't handle the sight of a rotting corpse. :)I give the show itself 5 Stars and have to deduct 2 stars because it is disappointing to see Amazon.com charging for episodes that are available on Fox.com from free.Buyer beware - Always check a shows network website if it is the current season you are looking to catch up on an episode as most networks are posting full episodes now.
1,Not Complete...but only in the US of A,This was a disappointment. The first 4 episodes are just not there!!! Is it because the box would only take 6 disks? The British and Australian versions are 7 disk/26 episode sets...in a bigger box. Why isn't this one the same? Looks like the American producer just got plain lazy. What a rip-off. I also see that this is the only series of Bones not advertised as `Complete'. Hmmmmm....not happy.
2,Missing Episodes!!!!,I absolutely love this show. I have been watching for years and was excited to receive the 4th season on DVD. I watched all the episodes provided and realized I was missing some. The two parter where they go to London was not included. I cant tell if Fox did this on purpose when releasing the series but I am very disappointed.
4,Bones 4,"Always a good show, great actor and actress. Work well together. I plan to have all the Bone's collection in my case."
3,Cheap Network Execs!!!!,"Like many I was upset to learn Zach had left the show, but the writing and performances remained excellent and made season 4 one of the best. Not so this boxset. I was shocked when I looked and the episode list and saw that the first four episodes were not included. Just because they decided to pad season 3 by including those episodes doesn't mean they shouldn't have included them in season 4 where they belong. I happen to own the previous sets, so I own those episodes, but this is still a slap in face. If they hadn't done this I'd have given the set 5 stars."
3,Bones 4,All of the disc's would play except one. I had to go buy one at the store so we would have it for Christmas
2,Unsatisfied,"I love the Bones series, but I couldn't watch parts of it, due to 3 scratched discs! When I order something, I really think, since it's sealed, it should be in new condition!"
4,Missing Zack and Dismayed about direction of the character Angela,"Very enjoyable - you can't stop laughing. Love the constant merry-go-round of new interns who are trying to fill the HUGE void left by Zack. I agree with 'Bones' and 'Hodges' - Zack is impossible to replace. Love love love 'Sweets' and 'Gordon-Gordon', who we don't get to see enough of. The only character who is disappointing this season is 'Angela'. Too bad the writers took her character in an about-face. The personality traits they have given her this season are bizarre - straight, lesbian, horny, etc. Is this all there is to her character other than being incredibly tech-savy? I hope season V has her returning to the 'sane' character she was in the first 3 seasons."
5,Enjoy DVD season's,Recieved as a gift and it is great to be able to add to our season collection each year. Bones has a excellent story line and cast humor.
3,I wish I had a brain tumor...,"While many people raved about how good this season was... I can count on one hand the episodes I would even consider wasting my time with again. This season almost killed my love of the show entirely. It felt almost like a bunch of aliens took over the writing... or even worse, fanfic writers. You are asked to suspend reality too often. And if you loved the science, too bad. Watching this season felt like the writers where pulling ideas from anywhere and wandering around blind to do it. And while Bones is a funny show, this season relied far to heavily on cracking a joke at the expense of quality. I spent most of the season talking myself into watching, and I guess if being so horrified you can't look away is a good thing, then this season rocks! It only gets three stars for the handful of episodes that I enjoyed and the history of greatness."
1,"Great show, poor packaging","The first three seasons of this show were released in a much sturdier packaging than the fourth season's. The result was that 4 of the discs were loose, and the plastic prongs that hold the discs in place were decimated before it even reached our house. All four discs are now unreadable despite attempts to clean and resurface them. I would only recommend buying this product from a store where you can tilt the box to tell if the disc holders are still functioning or not, or downloading it directly. Either way, I'm not very happy with Fox for switching to this shoddy packaging midway through releasing this series."
4,Bones Fan,"I enjoy everything about this series. The humor, the effects, the drama. My favorite episode is the Christmas and the one in New Orleans. I look forward to the next season."
4,Bones is great!,"What more can i say? The show is great and I have every season! Great eye candy, fun comedy, intriguing stories and supporting cast. However when I purchased the show I thought I would be able to view on my itunes account! That is the only drag! I can't!--This does not help when I am not in a wi-fi hotspot. Love the show nonetheless!"
5,What a way to learn...,"This show, TV series, is so educational yet you fall in love with the characters and their jobs. I know that when see Bones and Booth together, I know that everything is okay in my little world at that time. Buy it, rent it, watch it... you won't be sorry!!!"
5,Bones Forever,"The Bones series is a wonderful adventurous next step for Boreanaz. I eagerly await Season Five, which has been delayed, again."
3,Great show,"I received this product very quickly, but the first disc was scratched. I order a lot of DVDs from Amazon and this is the very first one that was scratched. I think it just happens sometimes during shipping."
2,"BONES, Season Four","The product a set of tv shows on discs, arrived in a reasonable amount of time. However, given there are six discs at least half of them had one show that could not be seen because the picture broke up and the sound was scrambled. The ad said the product was ""like new"". Must be that means not all of it works well. I will think twice about ordering something like this again."
2,Cheating the viewer,"I love ""Bones"". I enjoy the mix of humor with hard science. I like the relationships among the characters, esp. the relationship between Brennan and Booth. What I don't like is that, according to the list of episodes on the DVD set, the first 4 episodes of season 4 - ""Yanks In the UK"" parts 1 and 2, ""The Man In the Outhouse"" and ""The Finger In the Nest"" are omitted from the DVD set. Extended episodes are fine, and I always enjoy seeing what landed on the cutting room floor, but not at the expense of having the complete season. That's cheating the customer, especially when the set is described as ""The Complete Season 4""."
2,MISSING EPISODES!!!!!,I would have given a 5 star rating if all of the Season 4 episodes were included. But instead I open it to find that the first three episodes are missing which is HUGE seeing how things were left off at the end of Season 3. I can't even imagine why they would do this to the fans. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!
1,Unbelievable,"I am extremely dissatisfied with this product. I received it a while back and hadn't opened it until just recently when I decided to watch an episode or two. Besides the first episode, every other episode is crap. I as soon as I play any one of them, it says, ""attempting to read disk"" and skip all over the place. I've looked at the disks and there doesn't seem to be any scratches, but none of them work past the main menu. I don't know if this is just a manufacturing error or a rip-off, but I am pissed that I wasted my money on it. I haven't attempted to return the product because it's been so long since I received the product and I am too busy to mess with customer service/shipping it back, etc. I have just excepted this as a complete loss, but I thought I'd give it a quick review to help someone else from having the same problem."
1,defective product,"This product was defective.That's the problem. If I got it from amazon instead of from a third party I would have been better off.You get what you pay for.The low price promted me to buy, but 3 out of 6 discs were unwatchable. I would not ever buy another product from this company!!!"
5,bones good,Pretty much the same show so if you liked the other 3 seasons than you will like this season as well
5,I love this series,I started watching reruns of this show. I got hooked on it and had to add it to my small collection.
5,One of my all-time favorites...,"Hi, I'm a 15 yr. old young woman, and I'm currently reading this book for the third time. My mother purchased it for me a few years ago, and at first I was just like, ""Oh like this will be interesting."" I was only into Baby-Sitters' Club and that sort of thing. Then I finally did read it, surprized that I enjoyed it very much, (MUCH more interesting than the Baby-Sitters' Club any day!) At the time I didn't even understand all of it, but I felt Alma's pain and realized what a powerful story she tells. Plus, everytime I read it over, I understand more, and it makes me cry everytime. I also learned more about the hardships of war than I'd known. I can definitely relate with her on many levels throughout the story and one of the most amazing elements I found about this book is that it was written by a man! If you've read it you know what I mean, and if not- go read it today!"
4,Haunting...,"Told by 14-year-old Alma, this story follows a group of adolescents orphaned by war and taking refuge at the abandoned Hotel Sarajevo. Although each is outwardly hardened - as is necessary to survive a war - each is also clearly starved for affection. The group members form attachments among themselves as they fight and steal their daily food, and cower in the hotel basement when the bombings increase.As the group diminishes, one by one, Alma is faced with a choice...should she stay among the war-torn rubble, where she at least knows what she's up against; or take her chances making a run for the border? Either way, she knows she isn't likely to have a very happy ending."
1,The magnets are not powerful at all,I bought this unit and it will barely stick to my roll cart tool box. The magnets are useless. I found another version that sticks far better.
2,"holds boxes tight, doesnt stick to anything","I bought these for my gloves. Well, the magnets cant hold this up at any angle. I guess it might work for a half empty box of tissues but anything more than that the holder will fall off anything its on."
5,Just like the more expensive red one!,"Not much to say about this glove dispenser except it works as advertised. The magnets are plenty strong to hold it to your tool box (or other metal surface). It has a black satin finish, devoid of any logos. The springs, formed from the punching the sides, hold a smaller box of gloves snugly and will allow for a larger box. (While not easily seen in the picture, there is one in the back as well.)Overall, I'm very pleased."
2,NOT -- magnetic,"So disappointing. Couldn't get it to stick to anything. Otherwise, if you plan to mount it the 'spring' keeps a box of gloves firmly in place."
3,Does what it is supposed to do,But be careful not to bend the assembly when installing it. It seems to bend quite easily and can often be difficult to get boxes in. Pretty good overall and looks nice. Magnet doesn't seem to hold well.
1,Would not recommend,Magnets DO NOT hold up..total crap for the price..had to glue it to the tool box for it to hold.
5,Historically Significant,"Historically significant WWII era music that,in spite of being French, was appreciated by American Servicemen. That was before the days of the conservative hate machine against anything European. Piaf had a beautiful voice and sang songs that evoked loving sentiments from listeners. Piaf had a difficult start in life which is reflected in the ballads she sings."
4,Excellent book to have for a statistics learner,This book summarized very fundamental knowledges with details of statistics which is valuable to recommend to whom like to learn.
4,Pupupusssyyycat,"Babylon is a underrated song.Ofcourse you have the classics ""Don't change that Song."",Bathroom Wall"",.Smash Alley is another unsung great.Classic álbum."
4,Good Product,"I really like this bar. It tastes good and it's almost big enough to be a meal replacement. My only complaint is in the title: 'chocolate-peanut crunch.' Maybe it melted in shipping, I don't know, but they weren't crunchy and tasted more like caramel. Still a good taste and great value though."
2,"Does the job, I think, but if taste alone could kill...","I bought the protein bar after trying EAS's MyoPlex bars and MLO's Xtreme Peanut Butter bars, I really had a hard time stomaching these. Honestly though, I think drinking protein shakes made from powder is a cheaper, tastier, and more effective alternative."
4,Faulkner,Being a fan of W. Faulkner's this is another of his stories that I've enjoyed before. As always happens when reading a work again you find parts of stories or aspects of characters that ether you didn't fully understand or get a different perspective about. So I now have a different understanding of the story this time then I had before.
2,Mumbly-Jumbly,"And, after the welcome respite of The Reivers and Soldier's Pay, we're back to the *real* Faulkner, the one who has weighty and interesting things to say, but buries them in page-long sentences and mumbly-jumbly stream-of-consciousness. I love the idea of this collection - eight distinct stories, all inter-related (kind of like the characters). And I especially enjoyed seeing Boon Hoggenbeck's beginnings in ""The Bear."" But, as with so much of Faulkner, I just find that the sweat and blood of digging out the meaning of it all isn't worth the meaning once I actually find it."
4,Just as resonant as better-known WF titles,"I first read Go Down, Moses in grad school but am now returning to it after 3 years. Faulkner explores his usual themes--memory, history. black/white/Indian relations, the South, slavery, ownership, etc.--in a way that's just as compelling as in Absalom, Absalom or Sound and the Fury. It's a collection of short stories which I believe are meant to be read in order, unlike other collections. We get different viewpoints from different characters at different ages. When you're tempted to give up in the middle of a 5-page-long sentence, don't. Fascinating"
4,Don Rickles still the King,This tape was still great but the material was a little dated. Most of the people mentioned are from the late 60's and early 70's. If you are not from that era you may have a tough time relating to the people mentioned. Overall still very entertaining as no one does insult better than Rickles.
2,Not the best from Rickles,"Maybre I expected too much, but the comedy and style were not the best of Don Rickles. Maybe its just me-maybe I'm just a hockey puck."
1,"Dated, boring material, not his best","This CD has moments, but for the most part, it's not vintage Rickles. Rickles can really bring down the house at times, and you only get a hint of what he can do on this CD. Rickle's improteau comments on people in the crowd or roasts work much better than these phony interviews. I'd like to find the best Rickles material out there."
4,Funny,This would be a better and more funny if this were a dvd instead of a cd.People like to see comedians
5,Fabulous Resource,"I am a vocalist with long-standing neck and shoulder problems that affected my singing. While I was concerned that there are no AT instructors near where I live, I've made dramatic improvements in just a few days. Very easy to follow, but I had read a couple of AT books prior to this. While one size rarely fits all, Jane Heirich seems to have covered all the bases."
5,Hilarious Show,"Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia is an amazing show which will make you laugh and chuckle when your watching it, the show is a great show that is hilarious and is very enjoyable"
5,Best episode of Sunny,"I had to have this so I could watch it over and over. If you've never seen sunny it's not the best one to start on, but it's a wonderfully hilarious episode."
2,2 Bad Episodes Here,"Great series, but the Liberty Bell episode and the one about the Nightman were awful. Very tedious. Charlie Day is too much sometimes, and tends to get annoying.I love the show, but these two episodes magnify its flaws."
4,Box in poor condition,"When I received the package, I heard a lot of rattling around inside the case. The DVD case was broken pretty badly, and the disks were rolling around the box. However, all 3 disks played perfectly, and I could not be more pleased. Great price! I LOVE Always Sunny!"
5,Finally!,"I am so glad to as Season 4 to complete my collection of every season to date! It was delivered at the perfect time a few days before Season 5 started on FX. This is quite possibly the funniest show on TV right now. The hilarious adventures of D, mack, charlie and Denis never fail to surprise me and I am so glad that now I can watch episodes from last season whenever I want. Danny Devito is unforgettable as the troll in the Nightman Cometh musical from the final episode. Now I can't wait for the release of A Very Sunny Christmas to see how this dysfunctional gang handles the holidays!"
3,weaker,"This season is simply not as good as the previous ones. While the previous seasons were excentric and wild, in a most unusual way, here the attempts to go for gross-outs actually spolis the humour. The cast is great as the bunch of low-lifes who run Paddy's bar in Philadelphia but while there was acrazy funny side to the humour, now it is simply crazed. Danny De Vito was allways a problem because his character is not likeable at all in this series. The titles of the episodes say all: Mac and Charlie Die, Who Pooped the bed, Sweet Dee has a heart attack.... It does simply not hold up to the standards of the first seasons, which were irreverent funny. The worst bar in Philadelphia episode is the best and goes quite over the top with the gang kidnapping a restaurant reviewer for sacking their pub. The live performance featurette is good. there are still som funny moments but you will be better off starting with seasons 1 and 2."
2,"Written for shock value, and no McPoyles!","I love this show, but the 4th season only had about 3 funny episodes. They seemed to look for the shock value this season, and the result was simply not funny. I thought the poop episode would be good, but it was lame. As Artemis went into her theory, about 1/3 of the way I simply lost interest because it was ridiculous and not clever. That seemed to sum up most of the episodes. Plus, the whole Charlie-waitress thing has been beaten to death. And not one episode with the McPoyles! They are the best extra characters on the show. I was very disappointed with this season."
1,"Steer clear of this season, check out the first three instead.","If I had seen this season before any of the others I probably would of been a bit amused; however the best way I can put it is that this season is just a crappy version of season 3. Alot of jokes from previous seasons were rehashed and most of the new ones fell flat. I love this show, but I hated this season. Here's hoping for a brighter sun next season."
1,Terrible!!!,"Ordered over a month ago and still waiting, contacted the seller three times never got and answer, had to file a claim on it which still pending. Terrible experience!"
3,No commentaries,"Unlike the previous DVDs, this one lacks commentary tracks. What's up guys, getting lazy? Don't they realize that one reason many people buy DVD sets is for the behind the scenes info. since they have already seen the episodes?"
5,This show is damn funny!,"I don't know how they do it. Each season just keeps getting funnier and more twisted. I don't care how much time they take between seasons, it's worth it. Everyone on this show cracks me up and I have no idea how far each episode is going to go. This is one of the best comedies I've ever seen."
5,If you are looking at this then you know its good,"Clearly ""It's Always Sunny"" is a good show and if you are looking at this page you know it is. So quit reading reviews and just buy it."
5,"Hilarious, hilarious, hilarious",My title says it all. I look forward to viewing their 5th season on 17th sept. this coming fall!!
3,"Season 4--Pretty Good, Not Great","While seasons 1-3 were fantastic, season 4 was inconsistent. Some very good episodes (Sweet See has a Heart Attack, Mac Bangs the Waitress, Extreme Home Makeover) along with a few OK episodes (Manhunters, Gas Crisis, Erotic Life) to the series' first bad episode (Pooped the Bed). No McPoyle Brothers this season, a disappointment. Not much waitress, either, just one episode then a little in the finale. Kaitlin Olson stood out this season as Sweet Dee, with some very funny and original story lines--patheticgirl44!The DVD for the season was a bit of a letdown, too. No audio commentary at all, which is essentially standard on DVDs--very weak. How about getting David Hornsby (Cricket) or Mary Elizabeth Ellis (the Waitress) to do commentary if the guys don't want to. The live Nightman was cool, though the Erotic Stories extra was just OK. Here's to a better season 5!"
5,Required if you have a wok!,"I got this after seeing the Good Eats episode ""Squid Quo Pro"" where Alton Brown uses something like this to stir fry squid. For less than $40 this is beyond worth the money. Holy crap does this thing get my wok hot. The center flame baffle thing can be rotated on-top of or to the side of the flame to either focus or spread your flame.Pros:-Best Value-Highest BTU ratingCons:-Just like the other reviewers say the paint burns right off even during the first use, if this bothers you you could let it burn off before using but it's not really a deal-breaker.-It's loud, really loud, but I like it. I feel like i could put on a serious show tailgating.-You can't really keep a small flame without red flame."
5,Sounds like a Jet getting ready for take off!!!!!!!!!!,This thing boils water in a hurry!! It will bring my 32QT pot of water up to full rolling boil in under 12 minutes. Yes the paint peels off from the heat but I didn't buy it for its looks. This is a serious burner with some awesome power!
2,"Very hot, dirty, and dangerous","I bought the SP1 jet cooker as an addition to my homebrewing equipment. I cannot recommend this cooker. It probably will give you the most bang for your buck as it has decent wind protection and will heat 9 gallons of water to 170 very quickly, but that is the only redeeming quality. The paint on this model is not high-temp. It will burn and peel off very quickly, which means soon you'll have to deal with rust. It is also very, very loud. I use this in my garage with the door open and have to shout over it. Lastly, despite going through and tightening everything back down, I have twice had a fire start where the hose meets the burner due to gas leaking out. Spend a little more and get the SP10."
1,Simple but gets the job done,Review after second use:I cannot recommend this product. It created a huge safety issue. I had the propane hose in a straight line to the tank with no tension in the hose. The tank was about 3/4 of the hose length away from the cooker. The hose appeared to be in good repair and not kinked. After about 10 minutes of being on the propane hose caught fire. The result was the hose burning off the cooker. I was able to shut off the propane with no other incident but there is a flaw of some kind here. Here is the attached result: [...]Initial Review:I purchased this burner to make 5 gallon batches of beer. It was pretty cheap but it outputs enough heat to boil water in pretty short order. The one downside is I wish they would either have not painted it or used heat resistant paint. The paint peeled off after the first use. It didn't affect much but it was annoying as I had to clean my patio after each use for a while.
3,Works...will rust even when covered with high heat paint,"Read the reviews bought anyway due to price and the fact that I will only use it a few times a year. I lit it and let it burn the factory paint off then sanded the bare metal. I purchased black automotive header paint (1200 degree) and repainted, then cured the paint per paint manufacturer directions. During the first use, the high heat paint peeled off as well. I decided to store the thing inside my shed and give the bare metal a light coating of oil to prevent it from rusting out. Puts out a whole lot of heat and boils a huge pot in a hurry. Overall I am happy in spite of the rusting problem."
3,it works but....,"The jet cooker is exactly what we wanted for deep frying food; it works really well. However,the burner did not recieve five stars from me because the hose the burner comes with leaked, causing the hose itself to light up in flames. Summary:great burner, buy a replacement hose."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I'm giving this Jet Cooker a 4 star review because of the paint. It works perfectly, but before the first use you should run it on it's highest setting with the flame spreader over the flame to burn off the paint. After I finished burning it for approximately 10 minutes, I took a wire brush and finished off most of the paint that would contact the flame. It will happen no matter how it's used so it would be better that paint chips don't end up in your food. The unit is a little loud on it's highest setting, but what do you expect when you buy a ""jet"" cooker. It is kind of implied. Overall I am happy with my purchase and will be using this cooker to boil some wort for my homebrews for a long time to come. Also, after connecting the hoses, BE SURE to spray the connections down with soapy water to check for leaks prior to igniting the burner (which was easy enough with an extended grill lighter). I did not have any leaks but it is better to be safe than to be a burn victim!"
1,my copy was bad,"I had a previous Bayou Classic that was really good so I didn't hesitate to order this one especially with the high ratings it got. Mine, unfortunately showed poor quality control. The venturi (jet burner) was crooked. If it had been misaligned in the other direction a quick turn of the threaded venturi would have solved the problem, but it was crooked the other way with no way to adjust it. The flame ran up one side of the barrel tube, hit one of the ""clover leaf"" supports and went up one side of my wok causing uneven heating of the wok. Judging from the number of good reviews this must not be a common problem, but it is enough to turn me off of this model and brand. I'm sending it back and ordering a camp chef."
2,Not so Hot-blooded,"Pretty disappointed with this, for over $5, it's just a few short paragraphs that didn't tell me anything new."
1,Very nice belt,"Very nicely styled belt. No complaints so far.On a side note, I did own a belt of very similar construction. After a year of nearly daily wear it unraveled. But after a year, I guess that would be expected.****UPDATE****Don't buy this belt!I must agree with the later reviewer. After a few weeks of wear this belt began to break and unravel. Not only do I wish I'd found a better belt, but I wish I could change my rating to 0 stars."
4,Beautifully designed & seamlessly assembled first monograph,"Gyroscopic Horizons shows an indepth look into the process, motivation and presentational work from one of the most important young american architects currently practicing. For a first monograph, Denari's work is seamless offering a unique journey through the architect's portfolio and logic. Denari's book approaches a very important issue for understanding culture and technology. In 1987, renowned architectural critic and historian Kenneth Frampton (architecture, Columbia U) separated Neil Denari out among his peers as a more thoughtful designer. As Frampton predicted, Gyroscopic Horizons contains enormous insight and energy into this thoughtful architects work. Landmark First Monograph!"
3,Generally a good beginning text,"I've taught C classes using this as the textbook and find the students generally receptive to the book. As a previous reviewer mentioned some of the things the author does (such as define main with a void return type) are not correct, and he picks up the pace of coverage significantly in difficult areas such as pointers.If you do buy this book, buy a good reference book such as ""The C Programming Language"" by Kernighan and Ritchie to go with it. Many library functions are not well documented in the Horton book.If you know nothing about C and want to pick it up on your own, this book is one of the best I've seen at making it approachable. Its few errors are just (relatively) minor annoyances."
2,"good for learning major concepts of C language, needs work","Mr. Horton does a fine job of providing numerous code examples throughout his book, and examples files are available from the Wrox Web site. Although the book is designed for individuals who do not have any programming experience, there are a few complex subjects that he tends to gloss over a bit (such as pointers). After leading students into the language slowly during the first few chapters, the book suddenly begins to accelerate and skips over steps in getting to certain conclusions. It would be helpful to have illustrations in some areas (there are few except for the code examples), such as when pointers are discussed (e.g., memory addresses, indirect addressing). Diehard ANSI standard programmers would probably disagree with his definition of the main procedure as void, and there is no adequate explanation of this presentation."
4,Good,"This book was pretty well organized, as well as having good excersies and a nice program to do at the end of each chapter. I still go back to this book for reference on topics that I can't quiet remember. Also this book is a great thing to have around if you don't want to study C but just want to know how C works and how to make structs and all/"
5,An excellent book i ever read,"when I started learning C,I found it very difficult with the popular books,as the subject was not dealt properly.Ivor horton's book made learning C really enjoyable.I strongly recommend for those who look for a headway start.I dont regret for purchasing this book,as i sometimes do."
3,Ok exhaust,Purchased this as a replacement for a slp loudmouth exhaust and the sound is nice but the pipes are all rusty now and they have only been on the car for about 2 years. The car is garage kept and doesn't get driven much so I would have expected it to last a bit longer.
3,I was impressed. Short but very sweet entertainment.,Only 240 pages and I fell in love with the characters. It could have easily kept my undivided attention for another 700 pages. The author writes well and prompted me to seek other books written by him. I finished too quickly and wanted more. I hope to be seeing him on the shelves in the future.
5,WOW!,"Wow! Ace of Base is finally back! I wasnt too impressed with Cruel Summer (US version of Flowers)- i liked it , but not as much as THE BRIDGE. I imported this cd, and i was like WHOA! They took what make thier first album great, updated it, added some depth, funky beats, and great vocals! Tracks to check out are: Da Capo, Hey Darlin, Change with the Light, Unspeakable, and The Junvenile (my favorites, but they're all really awsome). DEFINATELY worth buying! The only downside is that there is a CD-Protection method used, which wont let it play it CD-ROMS of computers. Also availible is the DaCapo DVD - that's next on my ""To-Import"" list. Great job AOB! This is by far the best AOB cd yet! too bad only 12 tracks."
3,Something's missing,"This album is pretty good but it is not nearly as goood as previous AOB works. For years, AOB meant to me nothing but perfection. I had all their albums and songs, and I liked every single one of them. Any song from any album could be a hit if properly marketed. No filler albums earned popularity and respect to them.This album, however, fails to reach the heights of previous albums. It was slightly disappointing that after so many years, AOB did not make a better album. The melodies and lyrics are still there, but something is missing, and the songs fall short from being number 1 hits. Saying that, all songs are well done, some even might be in top 20 in your local radio station(like Da Calpo, Unspeakable, Beautiful Morning, World Down Under). If you want to hear good solid 12 tracks, this album should be for you. However, do not expect to hear megahits like The Sign, All That She Wants, Beautiful Life on this album."
2,They were better off da capo,"We all remember Ace of Base for they eurodance songs in the 90's, hits like ""The Sign"" ""All that she wants"" and ""Don't turn around"" but lately they have not had the same sound. The Eurodance more or less died out and they have been trying to do something new without much success. I don't know exactly what to cll this, but it sound more like pure pop to me. ""Beautiful Morning"" is allright, it's a notable song. ""Da Capo"" and ""Unspeakable"" are both allright but songs like ""The Juvenile"" were just made with lack of inspiration it seems, Ace of Base have reached their peak long time ago and it's kind of sad to see their decline with album's that they never would have produced around 10 years ago."
4,Well...I'll always love Ace Of Base,"I have loved this band for a while, and own all their albums. I must say that i miss Linn as the lead singer, and Jenny does rather annoy me, and since Flowers, which I really did like, they've gotten a bit more pop...but this album is still rather good and pleasant, though not living up to their previous releases.Beautiful Morning is a sort of choir oriented positive song which harks back to many other songs (such as beautiful life, and life is a flower). It's very nice though;) and ""unspeakable"" is a techno-reggae groover, which has become a single. I like that even more;) Another of the standout tracks is the cool techno title track, and ""Hey Darling"" which has a bit of a darker edge. This is rather a cool album, and it's nice to see them going at it again."
5,Wow!,"I've been an Ace of Base fan since The Sign, when I imported this cd I was amazed at the quality. I love all of the cd, I even got a few of my friends addicted to it!"
4,ace in your face,"I like this album. I like it even better with the singles included on the Japanese edition. It is certainly a return to form after the debacle of Flowers/Cruel Summer. There is only one thing that keeps this album from achieving and surpassing the greatness of The Bridge--the mastering. Virtually every song on the CD is brickwalled. I'm talking a solid bar of sound. There is no dynamic range. The wonderful supporting harmonies and back choruses are almost entirely swallowed up in the distorted loudness of the entire piece. It is almost impossible to listen twice through the entire album without getting a headache. Ironically, in a desire to make the music as loud as humanly possible, they have unintentionally neutered the strength of the beats that were so powerful in previous AoB releases. It is so disappointing that music this good should be treated so crappy. I give the music four stars and I give the audio engineers a solid kick in the nuts."
1,Incredibly poor content,Should be entitled ASIC to ASIC. Nothing to do with SoCs. Most ASIC design old tricks are listed and covered in a few lines. I can't imagine a SoC designer who could make use of this. Who cares saving a 100 gates in a multi-million gates project?
2,Not my Favorite JL book!!,"The very first romance book I ever read was JL when I was 13 years old. This book was a very emotional book, but it wasn't a favorite of mine. I found a lot of what happened in the book either very disturbing or it doesn't seem to go with the times. Since when does ""no"" mean ""yes drug me"" and How could Katherine return to the ""ton"" with a baby and no recriminations??Everyone was ok with this?? I understand that this is a book so an author has the liberty to do what they will, but it was just a bit harsh to me. I still love JL and I still love her books. This just wasn't one of my favorites!!"
2,Did I miss something?,"This book really GOT to me. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because this is Johanna Lindsey, and I usually love her books.So, let's get down to it, shall we? Some arrogant prince who is too cocky (yes, down there and up in the head, too) for his own good decides that the streets of London is a wonderful place to kidnap a sex slave, so he has Katherine plucked out of the street and brought to his pleasure. Since when did the streets of London become an open marketplace for sex slaves for Russian royalty? I wasn't aware that diplomacy extended THAT far, lol.This book was too much for me. I know Lindsey has a history of creating males who are gorgeous, strong, and wise (but also arrogant as heck), but usually the male has some qualities to redeem himself. I found Dimitri irritating and too sure of himself."
3,An old classic,"This love story is definitely well written, even though I would have loved a bit more of interactions that showed their mutual love. It seemed like half the story that they're separated thinking about each other, rather than together.Even though this is a well written story, it just doesn't compare to her other books like ""Hearts Aflame."""
5,Favorite Johanna book,"This is the first Johanna Lindsey book I read and I instantly love it. it was so detail and nice example of strong characters. Katherine st. John is example of smart woman who holds on to her values but opens her heart to a wonderful adventure. Yes, it pushed the envelope but it was still tasteful and unoffensive. This book made me want to read other Lindsey books."
5,"Very hot, classic Johanna Lindsay","Secret Fire has always been one of my all time favorite books from Johanna Lindsay and when my other copy was lost, I was devastated. So I had to buy it again!! It is one book that I like to go back and re-read regularly. Even all these years later, it is still very HOT and the writing draws you in and makes you feel like you are actually in that era!!"
3,Fantastic story,"Great character's, good story line, vivid detail. Keeps it real and keeps historical facts in line with what her story portrays"
1,Disappointing,"This book was recommended on the basis that the heroine was not a beauty and had other quality characteristics that a reader would perhaps identify with. However, I found nothing appealing about the plot SPOILER why would I want to see myself in such a role where the ""hero"" drugs me more than once in order to have sex with me? What kind of issues would I have to want to live vicariously through this female character? Sad."
4,Surprisingly entertaining,"Secret fire is the first romance book i ever read. I believed romance books were all the same, they just have sex from the beginning of the book to the end. One night I was bored so I starting reading the book. I was so into the book i read it in two days. I was enchanted by all of the characters. I'm glad I read the book"
2,Sick Sick Sick!!!,"This book is gross. I don't know, sometimes 'rape' that isn't really rape is sexy in romance novels but it was more like the heroine, Katherine, was debased cruelly. She was a proud, strong woman and the whole thing just seemed....sinful, I guess. I'm generally not too uptight but this book just had me shaking my head.Good examples of Lindsay are 'Warrior's Woman' and 'Prisoner of My Desire'. 'Secret Fire' just ignited my revulsion."
4,Loved it (:D),"good read, good book...I enjoy the read the characters the storyline and the chemistry didn't get bored..."
4,"Same Lindsey Formula, but Still a Keeper",Secret Fire is one of my all time favorite Johanna Lindsey books. And I've collected all of them well up until a few years ago when I've felt Ms. Lindsey lost some of her fire.What I particularly liked about this book was the fact that the heroine wasn't the raving beauty everyone expected the hero to fall in love with but he just adored her.Of course you can expect the usual Lindsey formula...boy meets girls...boy abducts girl...boy and girl falls in love...something comes between boy and girl...girl flees...girl has secret she keeps from boy when he comes to collect her.
2,...,"She was kidnapped. They only spent a few days together. When they made love, it was because she was drugged. She was beaten brutally. She escaped him. The misunderstandings. And everything else. Just boring. Don't waste your time on it."
2,What was she thinking?,"There are several Johanna Lindsey's that I love, but this isn't one of them. The concept is intriguing, and the writing style is fine, but the characters leave much to be desired. Both the man and the woman were so juvenile and contemptible that by the end of the book I just wanted it to be over. Kill them off or fall in love, it didn't much matter. And then there is also my own personal pet peeve: There was a powerful APHRODISIAC central to the plot. That always drives me crazy, because THERE IS NO SUCH THING. Overall this book struck me as monumentally stupid but not in a fun way."
5,Lindsey's Best non-Malory book.,This was the very first romance novel I ever bought or read. I was stuck in the subway and bought a paperback at the newspaper stand - this was it. I've been hooked ever since. The sexy Russian prince who meets his match in a sensuous-under-her-corset English miss is pure fun. Dimitri is at his wit's end - but Katherine is always true to who she is.
2,Lindsey has better,"This book is ok; however, it doesn't stand up to her newer works, such as Once as Princess or Love me Forever. I'd recommend reading her newer works and if you want to read Secret Fire, borrow it from a library."
1,not like the old books,"This books is not like her old books where the female and male character chemistry is so strong you could feel it. Katherine and Dimtri on the other hand agrued so much I dnt understand how they fell in love. The female was a shrew and man I just dnt know. The ending was rather quick. You give your readers 323 of agruing and drugged sex which i feel he should have did more often with her attitude, but only 3 pages of a quick ending pluzz.I have all of Mrs. Lindsey books but her last three has been a let down. So I'm done buying them."
4,Wonderful!!,I LOVED this book and I LOVE Johanna Lindsey. What I want to know is why is a 12 year old child (another reviewer) reading a book meant for an adult audience?
5,The only bib you need,This bib is used at all day care centers in Sweden (I know because I worked at a lot of them). It's the absolute best bib because it catches all the food. The soft plastic bibs with pockets doesn't even catch half of the spills. This one will hold spilled drinks too. It's a little expensive but worth every penny!
5,Does a great job!,"I am so glad I purchased this bib for my son. I bought it for him when he was 7 months, and it still fits him and looks great at 18 months. The pocket does a great job of catching any food that escapes his mouth, and it washes clean very easily. This is the only bib that he has had, or will ever need."
4,Wonderful bib,"I have struggled for months to find a bib that worked well for our son. He can tear away anything that has velcro on it. We found one bib that made a nice pocket in the front to catch food, but it was only vinyl in the front. The back was made up of cloth, so cleaning the back from foodstains was near impossible. I searched in all the stores for a bib that wasn't velcro, had a pocket and was easy to clean. This Bjorn bib was a great purchase. I wish I had found it 10 months ago when we started to feed our son solid foods. It is incredibly easy and quick to clean! The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the neck opening was a little larger. It fits my sons neck fine,but it is on the largest neck opening now so we have no wiggle room when his neck gets bigger."
3,"The accompaniment to the Dusk album, released separately","This was originally a bonus disc packaged with the first 2000 copies of the ""Dusk At Cubist Castle"" album. It is meant to played AT THE SAME TIME as you listen to ""Dusk."" Start the CDs at the same time, lay back and let the amazing potpourri of sounds startle your senses. Definitely trippy.As an album by itself, well, it contains no actual songs, just a lot of ambient noises and such. It could work as a sort of surreal background track to your activities, but not much else. Hence the 3-star rating as an album.Used as intended, however...Whoa!"
2,CANDY,WHEN I RECIEVED THE CANDY THEY WERE ALL BROKE EXCEPT FOR A FEW. THE COMPANY REFUNDED MY MONEY I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY GOOD OF THEM. I WILL USE THEM AGAIN
2,Practical Design of Safety-Critical Computer Systems,"Much of the content of this book is devoted to fault tree analysis and common sense applications of redundancy. The book equates safety critical with low failure rates. Failures of any frequency are intolerable. I was expecting to see fault coverage techniques using inference instrumentation and safe-fail methodologies. Contrary to other reviews, I found this book to be very light."
2,Very Dull,"The rubies in these earrings are very dull, and my pair looked crusty like they were not cut properly. I sent them back."
1,Don't Bother!,"Okay, As I'm typing this review, MusicMatch is chewing away, trying to organize my modest library of 1400 songs. It won't abort, it won't display, but it's chewing away on the contents of my music directory, and I can feel another memory error in the works. It has already crashed twice.Once it choked on a bad file with a checksum error. Yeah, I would expect it to hiccup on a bad file, but not take down XP. I have about 100 programs on my computer (don't ask) and nothing has ever taken down XP except this program.I feel like an idiot for having paid for this ridiculous pile of crap when MS MediaPlayer does largely the same job for free.Don't make my mistake."
1,Zero stars really,"Zero stars to ANY software that will not run on both Macintosh and PC platforms, especially music software!"
5,Amazing photography --- a must-have for your trip,"From full-color diagrams of museums to detailed street maps of every city to straightforward summaries of each point of interest, this guide covers all the bases. Whether you're planning to visit one city or ten cities, for three days or three months, this book makes sure you won't miss anything. While it's a little light on hotel and restaurant information, the information on specific works of art and architecture are more detailed than you'll find in any other guidebook. And it's so beautifully done, you'll find yourself leaving it out on the coffee table for months after your trip."
3,"Beautifully presentation, lacks specific recommendations","This makes a good coffee table book for pre and post-travel. The photos and drawings are wonderful. However, the lack of specific reccomendations for restaurants, tips on how and when to see things, and local customs is obvious If you have to carry just one book with you, this one wouldn't be the one. If you want to impress your friends with what you'll see or have seen, by all means buy it."
4,Lovely to look at but ...,"A superb book for generalised planning, but it falls down with the travel basics. I had many hours of pleasure reading this before I booked my holiday, but once ready for the detailed planning stage, found the information lacking. Get it if you want to see the available sights, get a feel for the various towns and buildings to visit. If you want to book hotels and know the best place to stay in a town, you're better to get another guide as well (Lonely Planet etc). It's a wonderful coffee table book as well!"
1,Great pictures and history but that's about it,"I found this book to be good as a PRE-trip resource. I just returned from 10 days in Tuscany. The book gives a decent history of the cities and the pictures are amazing. Otherwise it doesn't do much to help you plan a trip beyond saying ""I'd like to go there."""
2,"Pretty pictures, but...","Too heavy and too complicated to be of much use. Maps are confusing and disjointed. If you do buy, rip out the sections that you like and leave the rest at home. Buy Rick Steve's and Rough Guides instead."
5,Anyone Traveling through Italy should have this book,"I traveled through Italy with this and 2 other roughrider books - one for Greece and one for Italy. This book was the best for maps and directions for all of the sites museums and with its pictures and historical info, I found it an excellent companion especially in helping identify my pictures when I got back home. Wonderful pick....."
5,The Best Travel Companion!,"Eyewitness Travel Guides are encyclopedias for the country, regions and cities. Anything AND everything you must know about the area is covered with gorgeous pictures and historical background on churches, towns, people and food in Italy. I NEVER travel without a DK Eyewitness Guide.Please note that the hotel and restaurant information in the back has been little useful because nowadays, the internet,word-of-mouth and frankly, travel guru Rick Steves' are more reliable in the hotel area.And as far as the restaurants are concerned, that's not something you can plan ahead of time. Recommendations upon arrival in Italy are best. The natives know where to enjoy olive oil & four cheese pizza near Santa Maria Maggiore or lasagna you'd die for at a cafe in Piazza Navona.Don't leave home without Eyewitness. Ciao!"
5,Great book for anybody going to or interested in Italy.,"This is an very good tour book that goes in depth into the kinds of thing you find in Italy. This includes: Pictures of typical Italian foods, great illustrations, maps and much much more. I highly recommend it!"
5,The Best Travel Guide I Have Ever Seen,"Filled with pictures and perspective, this is by far the best travel guide I have seen on Italy. This guide bothers to go beyond telling you the facts and what everything costs. It shows you what is out there, provides detailed maps on how to see it, and lets you know the significance of the subject. I feel like I have a personal tour guide. Great Job!"
1,Useless... but great pictures!,"As a travel guide, this book is beyond useless! The pictures are amazing and they will definitly inspire you to take a trip to Italy but once your get there, if you depend on this book, your family will have to declare you missing! There aren't any directions to any of the places addressed in the book. And some of the places discussed would be impossible for the average person to go see on his/her own. I used Let's Go Italy as my travel guide for my 3-month italian excursion and it was the best! Yes, it wasn't without it's errors, but nothing too off the wall. I brought both my Let's Go and my Eyewitness Travel Guide with me on my trip. I gave the Eyewitness book to a British girl I met while working. She only liked it for the pictures too!"
4,Exspensive looking for the price!,"I bought this for a gift and he is very pleased with it! He has no issue with the watch band as others have mentioned. He does not have a large wrist for a man, so if you looking for a unisex watch at a great price, this is the watch for you!"
4,Very good looking,This is a nice watch but the band could use some improvement. The watch itself is solid and keeps good time. I am not that impressed with the ability to tell time at night because the glow feature is weak. I set up my LED MagFlashlight on it for awhile to energize the glow and that did help. Overall I like the watch but I am looking for a better band. I gave it four stars because of the band.
4,"Sporty, sophisticated watch","I needed another watch for times when I didn't want to wear a metal band Seiko, e.g. in the gym, or going for a swim.Pros:Black plastic strap looks strong and manlyDial size is just right, not too big or too small.Luminescent hands and dials are a big plus for reading time in the darkRotating bezelCons:Wish it came in gold trim to complement by ring :)"
2,the hands do not glow in dark,"the quality of the watch is fine, the hour markers glow in the dark, but the hands DONT! very disapointed in pulsar."
4,Good for its price,"I got this one for my friend. Looks kind of ""manly"", the dial is big and you actually feel it on your hand. A good choice indeed. This model is actually a modified version of another model(#PF3293) by the same company which is priced at about $90. Needless to say that the other one is much more stylish but then this model saved you about 40 bucks and comes with just a little compromise on that guys kinda casual-flair.I would say this watch is certainly worth its price. So, go for it if you are running tight on your budget but if you can spare another $40 the other model is definitely a better choice. Someone else talked about the flimsy strap, I have'nt really had any problems with that."
4,Pretty-nice,"The watch itself is really nice. The body seems like it is rugged and tough. The rotating bezel is also smoothe. The only reason i give this a 4 is because of the rubber, flimsy strap."
5,What I thought of the Book,"The book was very well made and designed. I love the movie MUPPETS FROM SPACE, it's one of my favorites. All of the books based on the movie MUPPETS FROM SPACE are great! I love them all!"
4,Hazwoper book.,The book is typical of most documents simply regurgitating the OSHA standard back at us. It does cover all of the premises of the standard and is useful as a textbook when teaching the HAZWOPER program. The only drawback for using this in a public forum is the cost. I do recommend this book for others.
5,A light saver,"Giraffe 21306 - Light Bulb Changing System Combo KitThis is a remarkable item that I stumbled upon while watching Geekbrief.tv on my Tivo. It promised to help change out light bulbs in difficult places quickly and easily. I was skeptical at first, but I had 3 light bulbs that needed to be changed in our two story foyer. When the packaged arrived I was quite pleased. After setting the item up and installing the batteries I was on my way. The Giraffe system was a blessing, it quickly removed the candelabra styled light bulbs and I replaced them with updated CFL light bulbs. This is an amazing system, buy it only if you wish to do things a little easier when chanhing light bulbs."
1,No handle shipped TWICE!,"I ordered this product and received the sealed package with no handle inside. I returned the original and received a second sealed package with NO HANDLE included! I gave up, as they seem to want to sell a partial product."
2,zipper tie,"The zipper idea was great. However, the zipper does not stay up in place. The knot keep slide down about an inch or so and show the collar."
1,Total rip-off!,"It's tiny and it's made very poorly. The case it comes in is also very flimsy. The box top says it's by ""Highlights for Children"", so I bet I could have gotten them for free with a subscription or something... Most definitely not worth 20 bucks! Don't waste your money!"
3,Not the best,Box is not well made. Would have returned it but my grandson really wated stencils and I couldn't find them any where else.
4,Good buy !,"I was skeptical about this product after I read the 1st customer's review. I searched the net for similar products, but found none. I checked out toysrus, target, walmart, they simply did not have stencils with fun shapes. They only had alphabet ones. I'm glad that i finally decided to buy this one. My 5 yr old draws, decorates and colors for hours. There are several shapes that she always makes me draw, now she doesn't need my help with. This is a good buy, go for it !"
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"After buying some Halloween stencils for my 5 year old and watching how much she enjoyed creating with them, I decided to buy a stencil set for her Christmas present. I found this one and decided to buy it (not many stencil sets out there). I've been extremely pleased at the quality of this product and the variety of stencils included in the set. Has numbers, various holiday items, animals, etc. I'm very happy with this product and i know my daughter is going to LOVE it. Also, these plastic stencils are a lot sturdier than what I had purchased for Halloween. I'm very pleased about that!"
3,Seemed a little pricey when I saw the product,I bought this stencil set for my grandchildren and the stencils themselves are fine. I believe the picture somewhat misrepresents the set as it is smaller than what the box appears. I was concerned if the children would have trouble using smaller stencils but since they are well made and thick they do stay in place. I do not think the set is worth $20.00 but I saw no reason to return them. They will last well and hopefully be used for a long time.
4,Stencils work well for a variety of projects.,Bought the stencils as a birthday gift for someone. She is really enjoying the stencils. She felt they are of very good quality. She is currently using them for her scrapbooking and knows her daughter will love them for drawing projects as she gets older. The thickness of the plastic will keep them in good shape for many years. The only negative for me was that they were alittle expensive for stencils.
3,Not what I expected for the price,"My daughter used stencils at my in-laws awhile back and loved them. They were older ones so nice, sturdy plastic. I ordered this set as a Christmas gift for her so she hasn't actually used them yet but they are a lot flimsier than I expected. They will probably work fine but for $18+, I expected a bit higher quality. The case they come in, while nice that it will keep them contained in one spot, was fairly low quality as well. The one I got was yellow and it tips over constantly if you have the lid open so I know my daughter will have trouble with that. I will say that the variety of stencils is very good so I will be keeping them to see how they'll work for her."
2,"Very Small, 1/4 the size I expected. Not worth the price.","Had I seen the product in person, I would not have paid more than about $5 for it. The stencils are only 3.5"" tall and 5.5"" wide. Images are so small for coloring. This is why I rarely shop on-line - you never know what quality you'll get. I will keep anyway to see how my niece likes them.The holding case is yellow and not blue. One good thing is the outer case says Made in the USA! I wish all items on Amazon would have an indicator of where it is made so we would know prior to buying.Here is the link to what you really get: http://www.highlights.com/product/stencil-set"
2,Too Pricey,"I found the product to be overpriced. This is a good idea, but not worth the money. The box was a different color than pictured, yellow. The stencils are thin and flimsy. Quite a few more stencils should be included for the price or the price should be significantly lower."
4,Good buy,"This is a good buy because it comes with a lot of stencils. I am disappointed there aren't any basic shapes (circles, square, star)."
5,Good product,"Stencils are a good thickness, not thin and flimsy as you so often find thee days. Would recommend for all young artists"
3,Good variety,"There are a lot of stencils here, and some fun pictures, but a lot of them are hard to tell what they are and end up looking a bit distorted when you actually trace them. My daughter seemed happy with it though."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Ok so I am not a huge Lou fan but putting that aside this is one of poorest excuses for entertainment I have had the misfortune of viewing and listening to!The visuals are not even DVD quality.The sound takes you from levels experienced in The Exorcist or something Beethoven could feel to the voices of angels in a girls choir! Like WTF?Sorry I must be getting older or its that there is too much better out there.I feel its the latter this is just a poor excuse for entertainment and doesn't merit one more written word of time period!
1,Very Simplistic,"This book is not worth buying. No useful information is provided. If you're looking for a reference guide, look elsewhere."
5,jamaican warriors,"JAMAICAN WARRIORS is fascinating and though about music, the social/political tones are revolutionizing and nurturing my understanding of reggae. I feel as though I'm with the author and the warriors as the textual conversations and images are so inclusive. Such makes for rewarding reading and fast page turning. A multifaceted book whether music, Jamaica travel, or history be your love."
1,What Were They Thinking?,"I've gotta admit, I collect albums from my favorite bands whether I like them or not, but I must say, this is not one of my prized possessions. After the first listen I would say ""well, maybe i'll give it another shot.. maybe im being too harsh."" but i'm not. This CD is terrible. Of course it has the hit song ""Stand Up"", and its a great song, but the rest of the songs could've been written better by a 10 year old. I'm guessing they were rushed on the making of this album. And not to mention, they back up bassist's voice is just TOO whiny. Music wise - decent. Lyric wise - Terrible. Vocal's wise - horrendous. Definatly check it out somewhere else before buying this."
2,A Disappointment,"After buying and listening to A Static Lullaby's first CD, ""And Don't Forget To Breathe"", I was so excited about their follow-up since their debut had such great potential for an incredible rock band. Then here comes ""Faso Latido"". Where all the talent and creativity, all the hooks and all the originality, where all the good qualities were; was all replaced with mundane boring and nondescript electric guitars and lacklustre vocals. All that potential, and all of it wasted. Pissed away in hopes of hoping on the new mainstream punk/rock/hardcore train that such bands as Taking Back Sunday and Fall Out Boy have jumped upon. It's a damn shame that such a talented band have compromised originality and the potential to change a genre for the hopes of hearing their music played on MTV and the radio. It really makes me sad. So many bands have forgotten what making music is all about, the art of it, not the popularity. And unfortunately, A Static Lullaby has forgotten what it's about."
2,This cd sucks.,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! If you want to check them out, buy ""...And Don't Forget to Breathe,"" their first cd (it's incredible). I don't know how the second one came out so horrible but it's ridiculously mainstream sounding, not original AT ALL. Don't waste money OR time."
1,oh my god...,"I'm sorry guys, but what a terrible cd. Not only have they COMPLETELY sold out...(that can't even be denied)...but this cd just flat out sucks. The melodies are so off kilter they are terrible, the riffs mundane, the singing is flat out horrible, and the screaming has become so overproduced that it sounds stupid. Leaving aside my accusations of selling out-which is completely obvious-this CD just doesn't sound good. Their desperate (and obviously money hungry attempt) at mall punk rock just comes off sounding not only mundane and generic, but horribly generic."
3,mild deception...,"I was mildly deceived by one of my favourite band's new album. A Static Lullaby had an excellent debut album, ...And don't forget to breathe, but it took me a while to get used to the new one, which sounds different from the first one, since it is more melancholic. They sometimes remind me of Taking Back Sunday, another bad that I absolutely love, but whom I hate to see get copied. A Static Lullaby does not have the lead vocals required to play around with them, as it is the case for TBS. Nonetheless, I still enjoy listening to this album, although it is not among my top 10."
2,what happened?,"when i hear that this album was coming out, i couldnt wait. then i got it. it is absolutely nothing like and dont forget to breathe... which is one of my favorite cds. there is no energy. way too poppy. biggest disappointment ever. it is ok for a band to change, not suck. if i wasnt expecting so much, maybe i wouldnt mind this album. if it wasnt static lullaby, maybe i wouldnt mind. but coming from a band who used to be so amazing, i mind."
1,What happened?,"Oh my god, what happened to this great band. Static's first cd sounded GREAT, but this just plain SUCKS, the only good song on this entire cd is ""Radio flyers last journey"" which sounds like the old static and ""stand up"" is JUST good enough not be called sucky. ""The Jesus Haircut is without any doubt one of the worst songs EVER. Static do us all a favor. Either release an album EXACTLY like your first one, or dissapear from the music scene."
1,A sad day in music,I cannot believe that soo many bands are letting me down lately especially ASL who were one of my favorite bands. I can play and dont forget to breathe over and over again but this album i can mabye listen to two songs. For one i must say i love radio flyers last journey but i had that song long before the album came out. The only reason i created an amazon account was to rate and comment on how much this let me down thats pretty damn bad if u ask me. The only reason i would give this album one star is for radio flyer. all the rest joe just kinda wimped out and they have just done what hopesfall did with a typesevery song just repeats and becomes dull its garbage not worth listening tobut i will remain a faithful fan and hope that they do not let us down again
1,total crap on a disc,"im sorry for the what, 3 people that gave this any kind grade above a star...its junk! dont buy it. I have to say, that i havent finished it...i have and dont forget to breathe..it was cool, but this is garbage. Anyone want a cd?"
1,Faso La-SUCK-o,"This album is completely awful. I enjoyed ""...and don't forget to breathe"" so I was really looking forward to this one, especially when I heard that they're re-doing radio flyers last journey. I can't believe I spent valuable money on this garbage cd. I don't understand how anyone could possibly listen to this album and say ""this is good."" The sound quality is 100 times worse then their last album, and the guitar parts are boring and spark no interest whatsoever. Oh and on a side note, to the singer/guitarist, you look STUPID with the long hair... please consider another career. To impressionable young consumers, AVOID this album.. I repeat, AVOID THIS ALBUM."
2,wow..what the hell is this crap!?,"dont get me wrong. i love a static lullaby. there first cd blew me away. from the first song to the last im in love with it. so, i heard that ASL was coming out with ""faso latido"" and i was like YES!!!!!!! and i was bummed i couldnt get it the first day it came out. now, im actrually glad i didnt get rush to get this cd. this cd is a piece of crap. this new cd sounds like a poppy band mixed with a wannabe screamo band. if you are a fan of ASL you will most likely become dissapointed with this cd. i mean, i have to give these guys credit. they are hard working musicians and have great talent..but what the hell man.i can honesly say this cd is a great dissapointment, but ASL regardless, is still one of my favorite bands and ihope they come out with another cd and it kicks ass."
2,my little sister loves it,"A Static Lullaby has never been one of my favorite bands, they were just okay...their first cd was pretty good but definitely nothing incredible. But it was enjoyable and had it's moments. So I got this cd hoping for some awesome music. This cd is nothing compared to the first...it's toned down. The vocals are completely different and at times completely boring. The lyrics aren't very good...and just everything about the cd is disappointing. There was actually not one song that I liked and I gave it to my 15 year old sister and she loves it...I gave it 2 stars because this band still holds a place in my heart...and I'll hope for a better cd in the future."
1,SELLOUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First let me just make something clear, it is not that the musicon this cd is horrible. It is generic mall punk at it's best. But knowing that s static lullaby made it after their And Don{t forget to breath cd is what shocks me! They might as well have changed the band name to release this.This just confirms to me that there is not one single band in the world now that can continue with their aggresive in your face style when signed with a major label. I am sure their fan base will completly hate this, and now with the oversatturation of pop punk on mtv and radio this won't be acknowledged at all, so all their efforts to get on the radio will be wasted anyways.Big letdown. Download it, but don't buy it!"
3,What the hell happened to ASL,"The most disappointing part of this cd is the vocals, i mean it sounds like he sung with the flu. I can't feel the energy off this new release like they had on their first release ADFTB. What the hell happened? I can't help but think Sony had something to do with this."
1,Good Lord..,"This is one of the biggest sins to happen in music. ""...And Don't Forget To Breathe"" was amazing, but what happened to them? They're trying to be popular, first by signing to Columbia, then going completely pop-emo. Their's barely any screaming, and all of this is just awful. Don't buy this cd, download ""Radio Flyer's Last Journey"" and you have the reason I gave this gold star, instead of 0 ( if it were possible ), because that's the only good thing about this album."
5,Best show on TV,Love this show. I have never been addicted (ha ha) to a show ever. I wish it could go on for at least 10 seasons but I think 2013 is suppose to be the last. If you never have watched Breaking Bad you need to give it a try - there is a reason why Bryan Cranston won the Emmy three seasons in a row for lead actor in a drama and why he won best actor again with a Screen Acotr award for 2013.
1,Didn't play has been sent back,"DVD wouldn't play even after updating my player only one of the four DVD,s worked and this has been returned"
1,"Great Series, but no Subtitles for hearing impaired in English",Not sure why they went cheap on this disk but there is NO subtitles in English. They do have it in Spanish and French.
4,IT IMPROVED COMPARED TO SEASON 3,"I'm glad this season improved compared to the previous season. After Season 3 I was about ready to give up on the show. In this season we get back to the drug wars (which I found the most interesting) and as creator Gilligan commented this is a ""13-episode chess game"" between Gus and Walt. Additionally, we get to see Gus in his younger years and how he came to hate the drug overlord in Mexico. Hank continues to follow the bread crumb trail (even though seriously injured in the finale of the last season) and seems to be getting closer at times. The flashbacks were some of the best parts of this season. The other part was of course the ongoing ""chess game"" between Walt and Gus, especially when Jesse was manipulated. STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; CHESS GAME: A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: November to December 2011."
5,Breaking Bad Season 4,"This show is the best. The plot twists and surprises. In my opinion, this is the best season to date, which says a lot."
5,Box cutter separates the evil from the bad,Wow! I don't know why I did not see this one coming! As our boys slip deeper into the abyss - The writing and editing and acting continue at an excellent level. This opening episode has me already hoping for continued seasons.
5,Seaon Four is Five-Star!,"The supporting characters -- particularly Skyler to Walt Jr. -- really come into their own this season, but the standout for me is Giancarlo Esposito as Gus. The range of emotions he is able to convey while maintaining a deadpan exterior facade of calm and normalcy is absolutely amazing. Walt's descent and Jesse's descent and rise after bottoming out are riveting to watch, as well. I'm just three episodes from the conclusion of Season Four and don't want it to end."
5,COMPELLING . . . .,"I watched all 4 seasons in their entirety. First 3 on Neflix instant view then I started hunting around to see if I could watch season 4 somewhere and I found it right here on Amazon! Right under my nose! I could not stop watching and had to see it through to the end. A good definition of a genius production is when you find yourself rooting for the bad guys. In fact, they were all bad guys. The ending of season 4 was very satisfying indeed. If there were no season 5, that would be alright with me. I would just assume that the story ended there and our two characters along with their families went back to living normal lives. HOWEVER, if there IS a season 5 . . . I WILL be watching! :)"
5,best show ever,"No other show on television has hooked me quite like Breaking Bad. I give it perfect 10's across the board: acting, pacing, storytelling, cinematography, etc. I even have the soundtrack, the music is just that good as well. So stop reading this and start watching Br Ba!"
5,Too cool for words!,"As I said, too cool for words! Check it out. You won't be sorry. This is a great example of the bad guy getting exactly what he deserves."
5,Hooked on BB,"After watching the very first episode, I was hooked and I have now purchased every season except the latest one."
5,Great show,"A must watch TV show, multi-dimensional characters, incredible character development from the first season to the last one. This show never fails to shock and surprise."
5,"""A funny thing happened on the road to ruin.....""","amazing, how such a simple plan can become soooo complicated. cook a little meth, collect a few hundred thousand and stick my feet up in the air and play dead, just wait on the cancer to eat me alive and let my family live out their lives comfortably after I'm gone. BBUT, NNNNOOOOOOO!!!!!......This show just keeps me on the edge of my seat every week, I love the anticipation of seeing what happens next each time the show opens. I think I'll have to track down every show ever done that has these writers names on it and go back to see what I've missed! creator Vince Gilligan was also associated with the x-files back in the '90's, I think his future is even brighter after this. can't wait for the fifth season."
5,One of the best TV shows ever,"Breaking Bad is one of the best TV shows ever made, completely different from most of the other tv shows out there. Its entertaining and interesting. Has great characters: real people with rich, complex personalities, not the simple minded canned characters you typically see in other shows. The BB characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors, they do such a wonderful job. It also has intelligent, creative plots, and you just can't tell where its going from episode to episode. Always catches up by surprise. I hope it sets a new standard for tv shows of the future. Looking forward to another great season."
5,breaking bad all 4 seasons,YOU DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU SHOULD FEEL SORRY FOR THE GUY IN TE BEGINNING. I THINK THE SHOW REFLECTED HOW WE LET PRIDE RUN OUR LIFE AND MAKE BAD CHOICES. THE MOVIE IS LIKE A GREAT MISTREY BOOK CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO THE NEXT EPPISODE.
4,You Have to watchthis it is great!!!,Great this seams to just get better cant stop watching this. I would say this could be one of the beast.
5,Doesn't get much better than this show,I can't explain how good this show is. The plot line is great and has room for all viewers to relate (except for kids). Not a show for kids. This is different than the scary prison show with kids. Definitely not the same thing.
5,I tell everyone I know....,who hasn't seen breaking bad to watch it and call me the as soon as they finnish the 4th season.
2,Awful Video Quality!,"Breaking Bad is one of the best TV Dramas out now and Amazon is one of my favorite places to shop but this was NOT worth the money! On my scrawny 23"" monitor it was pixelated and crappy looking. Just buy the HD version"
2,Bad Quality,"The DVD series came in on time and looked great, but when you put in the DVD to any DVD player, it makes an extremely loud and annoying sound. it makes the DVD player work extremely hard and it sounds like it is a jet engine. None of my other DVD's make this sound. Not only does it sound loud, but it takes forever to play. I ended up not even playing them because not all of the disks work. I found the series on Netflix and watched it there."
5,Top notch program,Just finished the 4th season. This show is amazing and has not lost its punch yet. Good work! Interesting finale to this season.
4,"Knocked off a star due to ""Jesse"" overacting IMHO.","Anti-hero show. Does not glorify drug use, in fact it does a pretty good job coming down hard on it. ""Walt"" (Bryan Cranston from Drive, Malcolm in the middle) is an incredible actor and really nails the character. He can handle the script, has the acting chops (who would of guessed a largely comedy actor had such drama chops) and makes his part real and gritty.""Jesse"" (Aaron Paul) actually won an Emmy Award for season 1 (I think?) so I guess they gave him a larger role in seasons 2-4. Don't get me wrong he does an outstanding job, it's just his dialog parts too often seem longer and speech oriented, as opposed to plot development. I found myself disengaged a couple of time throughout the season with him.Overall, a great series about drug abuse that even points out indirectly most meth heads do not get clean (I think 3% that try have one year clean). Violent too, though again it shows meths effect on society."
3,Breaking Bad...Blue,I had to return it.....because I already had it...What I was really looking for is Season 5 when it becomes available.
3,The season is started to fall off,"I liked the show but its starting to get too crazy and unbelievable. I wouldn't recommend buying this stuff, just waiting until it's all out on Instant Play"
5,Love Breaking Bad,Amazon makes it easy to watch my favorite shows online. Breaking Bad Season 4 was great. Breaking Bad is one of my favorite shows.
5,I'm addicted to this show!,"Yo dog, this show is like a crazy exiting movie that never ends. I liked the earlier seasons better then this one so far, but I like the show so much that I'm buying season 4 because I just can't wait until its free. I just had to see what happened after last seasons cliffhanger ending. The subject is contoversial, but the characters are very endearing. My favorites are Walt, Jesse, Hank, Walter jr. and the crazy lawyer. I would consider thia a dark comedy for adults only."
5,Fast shipment.,Received much faster than I anticipated. Exactly as described. Have not watched the dvd yet but I am sure it is in good condition as well.
5,Best show on television,Never thought I would love a show about meth but this is so well done!Can't wait to see season five
4,Fast Shipping,Came just in time for Christmas and was a great gift for my brother who loves tv. I haven't watched the series this far in though.
2,Defective disc,One of the discs was scratched and made viewing difficult. Several scenes were muddled and would skip to the next scene.
4,Perfect,Breaking Bad is a Great series! Glad I was able to download and watch instantly. I will definitely be doing this again very soon!
3,Jumped Tiburon,"The show has gone well beyond the plausible. It was fun the first 2 & 1/2 seasons, but now it's just working to suspend disbelief. All the characters have become overwrought cartoon people."
1,No English subtitles!!!!!!!!! GRRRRRRRR!!!!!,"I waited months for this to arrive only to find that there are no English subtitles. French?, Spanish, no problemo. English? No wayo... However, if you were smart enough to go blu-ray, you would get English.Frankly, I would love to just ship it back. For those of us who blew out our hearing listening to rock and roll, subtitles are critical."
1,Beware!!,"We have been waiting for season four for ages, so excited when we got it....only to discover the closed captioning is in Spanish and Frech ONLY! My hearing impaired husband is unable to watch after much anticipation! If you need this critical feature like some of us, beware. Hoping Amazon will make this right! UPDATE....works fine on regular DVD player but will not work thru any HDMI device? Maybe everyone but me knows this, but in case there are others as naive."
1,Hard to undo a mistake,"Pretty unhappy with the service. There is no easy way to track what you watch, like Netflix who shows you what you watch. If you have accidently ordered a redundant episode, there is no way to undo it.Lame, guess its Netflix or god forbid, Apple TV"
1,Breaking Bad Season 4,"If you haven't become addicted to the Braking Bad series, this season will do it. See the evolution of Walter White's persona go from ""Harry Potter to Scarface""."
5,what a ride!,"great stuff!what a ride, surprises at every turn. I'm in my 60's and still think it's fun. Great character building, story, suspence and teeth gnashing 'til the end. Highly reccomend for the strong stomached crowd."
4,One of the best series on tv,"Breaking Bad is one of the best on tv and I really enjoyed all four seasons (three seasons on Netflix) and S4 on Amazon. I am presently watching S5 and wanted to get completely caught up before the season began. Right after I bought S4 on Amazon, Netflix came out with it on instant. Oh well, still glad I got it. Thanks for making it available."
4,Astonishing,"The concept for this show sounded so depressing, I just didn't think I'd care for it. But once started, we couldn't stop. It's just like nothing else we've ever seen. The characters here live way out on such a far-flung, precarious, insanely terrifying edge of the world that it's difficult to comprehend. But, truly the most amazing storyline is how the dangerous, wounded creatures populating this alternate dimension are able to blend into the mundane work-a-day world that surrounds them."
5,Great,This is a great purchase from amazon. I had to have it and it was well worth the price.I love it
5,The best show ever,This was another awesome intense season...I recomend this show to all.....The writing and acting is first rate...I give i 5 stars.
4,breaking bad season 4,works great and I really enjoy the DVD and the series.I would recommend to anyone thanks again for the DVD
1,No Subtitles,Very disappointed this excellent TV show did not include subtitles. I will rent the DVD from Netflix in the future to insure I get this critical feature
3,Breaking Bad-Season 1,"I just bought Season 1 of Breaking Bad and have yet to watch it. I hope this series lives up to all the hype I have heard about it. The finest t.v. series I have viewed in the last 12 years our The Sopranos, Deadwood and The Wire. For my money, The Wire is the very best t.v. series ever made. Who knows, after I have finished watching all 4 seasons of Breaking Bad I might be willing to change my mind. I have heard from friends that The Shield is one of the most excellent cop t.v. series ever done, and even though I have only seen a few programs from this FX series, I'll say this much, it does hold your attention very well."
1,8 episodes of extreme boredom,"Having seen the first eight episodes of season 4 i have to say that sadly, this show has completely lost all momentum and suspense. It has become SO SLOW! I'm not going to go into great dephts about all the flaws here, of which there are countless. For hardcore fans who still think this show works, i suggest you rewatch seasons 1 & 2, then watch season 4. It's just not the same show. Of course, for a show to maintain its vitality, making sure it keeps evolving is key. It has evolved alright; into some sort of soap-action hybrid. It has become dull. Another thing that has completely disappeared from the show, is the wonderful dark humor, evident in seasons 1 & 2. It's just not there. The downfall began with season 3. After eight episodes of season 4, i'm afraid this one is just not gonna land. This should be the last season for a show that started out great, but sadly lost everything it had going for it."
2,Skipity do da!,"Frustrating CDs...they would skip inconsistently or would not play at all. I tried to exchange them through Amazon, but read that was not possible...so, they are just sitting on the shelf. Episodes I was able to view were great!"
5,Unable to watch the video out of the US,"I've been waiting as has everyone else who has enjoyed Breaking Bad for Season 4 to begin. I'm retired and am on holidays out of the US and Amazon wont allow me to purchase the videos. I have a US credit card & address as I am a US citizen but because I'm in Canada I'm shut out, that bumms me out as I've spent thousands of dollars over the years buying from Amazon......BAH!!!I think your policy stinks amazon."
4,Great show decent video quality,The show is one of the most entertaining I have seen in a long time. The video quality was average so if you want better quality you will have to pay a little extra for the HD version. In my opinion the HD should be lower priced and amazon should not even bother selling the non-HD version.
5,The best,"This is my favorite Breaking Bad episode. Many people get killed, more than normal. Highly recommended. If you like breaking bad, you gota watch this one."
5,Bug - Breaking Bad,"Had to catch up on season 4 before the 5th season began. Cable provider skipped this episode and didn't want to watch out of order. Gotta say, it's so easy to download episodes from Amazon and didn't have to deal with commercials. All that aside, Breaking Bad is the most riveting show on TV. There's so much to talk about after each episode and it's a challenge to guess where things are headed, which is so different from the usual prime time fodder where one can predict a show's outcome 5 minutes in."
5,Best season ever!,This was the most captivating season....the show just keeps getting better! The writing and acting can't be beat! Looking forward to seeing how they wrap it up.
5,"Not ""One of the Best TV Series Ever""....","Breaking Bad is not ""One of the Best TV Series Ever"".... because it is hands down THE absolute best TV series EVER. I got hooked after it had been playing on AMC for about a half a season. I went back and found the first few episodes on-line, got caught up to date, and have been a loyal watcher and fan ever since. It has just the right amount of drama and comedy while actually being believable. Many TV shows are entertaining, but you just know it could never happen. I would not be surprised to pick up the paper and read about a story similar to the Breaking Bad plotline. Also, not one of the characters is over the top perfect or evil; they're just like the people in the real world we live in. Just ""normal"" people living extraordinary lives due to bizarre situations."
5,WOW!!!!,"The moral of the story is don't mess with Mr. White!this is THE best show on tv, can't wait for next season!"
5,Aaron Paul's Best Performance,"Aaron Paul as Jesse is really given a chance to shine in this episode. We really get to see the complex layers in his personality. In one scene he is the cool party guy with lots of money to throw huge parties every single night. In another scene, the girl whose son he saved realizes he was the one who left her a huge wad of money to get a better life in a better neighborhood. But best of all, we see him falling apart, still not able to deal with having killed someone to save Walter's life. It is an all out masterful performance.Not that Hank and Walt are just idle in this episode. Hank is amassing huge chunks of rocks from his ebay buys as a mineral collector while he makes minute progress in physical therapy. His attitude has not improved a whit. Walt decides buying an untraceable gun from an arms dealer might be the way to go in solving his problems with Gus. This might be viewed as comic relief, he is so bad on handling a gun."
4,One of the best shows on TV,"What can I say? If you are a fan of this show, you KNOW that you can't wait to add this to your collection. It's thirteen episodes of crime filled goodness. Follow the criminal adventures of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman as they continue their misadventures in the world of drug making. Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn are true acting standouts."
5,Awesome,The best series on television today. Extremely well written and carried out by a fine troupe of actors. Buy it you'll like it
5,Simply the BEST,"This is the best television show that I have ever seen. The writing, directing and acting are not to be believed. INCREDIBLE!!!"
5,correction,"Sorry you thought this was a negative review (previously). Actually it was a very nice product. It was just not what I had wanted. I gave it to a charity, which I am sure some child will enjoy. Please DO NOT send a refund. I will be pleased to order from your company as the occasion arises.Gramma"
4,True Sixties Drug Music,"Real honest to god psychedelic head banging Sixties Drug Music. The metal bands of later years had nothing on these guys and they show they still have it in this 1997 concert footage. They are obviously enjoying themselves greatly. I went with 4 stars instead of 5 only because there were a couple of songs I couldn't really get in to. But the finale, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, is a real scorcher, I mean they are cookin'. I saw the band in 1968 in Buffalo, NY and it all came flooding back. I guess I'm lucky to recall any of it, you know what they say about The Sixties, ""If you can remember it, you probably weren't there."""
4,Easy as they Look,These tracks were as easy to put together as they look. They stay together nicely too. Wish they had these when I was growing up.Now - if the trains would just cooperate and stay connected we'd be in business...

4,Didn't want to put it down,"This book is really good for a lot of ages. It has stories where kids are telling it from their point of view, and it makes it more understandable. The stories in it have a lot of action and a lot of good endings! This book would be fun for anybody who likes things about pioneers and what happened to them, or just for people who want to read a good book!"
1,Not for the new Axis models,"Warning, this does not fit the new Savage Axis models. Works fine on older models, but the new ones do not have the same type of receiver. One star rating is only because it did not fit the gun I intended it for, nothing actually wrong with the base."
3,A Necessary Book,"I thought it was going to be more about the adventures in loft living (or something like that), but it was about economics, politics, and class/race. At times, it was dry. However, I know it's a fairly classic text and an important read."
5,Revealing the Unthinkable,"As most people know, Harry Mulisch is one of the best Dutch writers of modern times. Even His Holiness adored this book, his masterpiece: De Ontdekking van de Hemel. It is a novel that amazes you time and time again.The novel starts in heaven. A couple of angels are deliberating on what the Chief (probably God) is up to this time. Than, suddenly, you are thrown back to the earth. Max and Onno, the two main characters in the book, meet each other and everything seems to be normal again. Seems...A perfect novel with objects falling from the sky, love affairs, mysteries and even scientific theories! But be warned: the book takes a lot of time to be read (twice?) and once you've opened it, you won't close it."
5,A Perfect Book for a Person with Some Experience,"First, it's probably the latest book on the market, whcih means that it has an advantage over other older books. The structure of this book is very organized, and the substance well written: easy to read and explanatory, but concise. The auther always alludes to the big pictures or the key concepts behind the specific subjects so that I know where each little puzzle should fit into the big frame."
5,Nice intro for beginners,"The book focuses on the transition from a Windows-family OS to Linux and Unix in general. It is well organized and clear, though sometimes wordy. ""Mastering Red Hat Linux"" is primarily oriented at beginners, but also covers some more advanced topics like installation and configuration of mail and web servers."
3,Some words about the book Level,"The book is comprehensive and very helpful for people withlittle experience in Unix in general. However, the word""Mastering"" in the title does not definitely meet theexpectations of an average administrator, who buying thisbook would expect himself to become a Linux Guru. Finally,this is my advice to the new readers of the book:Unless you have the luxury to have a computer just for playing,don't even think about to upgrade your kernel from sourcecode following the directions of this book."
3,I'm a Linux newbie,"Being a Linux newbie, I give a 3 Stars. The books covers a lot of topics, but very thin. It does have a good coverage on installation and configuration. Coming from a Windows background, this book helps me get started. It is very weak on most of the server applications, like Samba, Apache, Database... I'm more interested in Linux server apps, not desktop apps.NO BODY BEATS MICROSOFT ON DESKTOP APPS, BOTH IN QUALITY AND QUANTITY! That's just a fact most Linux people can't deny.Overall it worths the money. The online Docs from Red Hat is just too dry and hard to read.Conclusion:Good for Newbies, Bad for Gurus...Good for Desktop, Bad for Server...Good for Installation, Bad for Administration...Advice:From Linux newbies, use this book for the 1st month or two to get you started. After that, just use the Red Hat Documents and various Linux websites for references. They are free and broad."
2,Super lag,"I bought this game a few months ago and was hoping to have a fun sim game for my PowerBook G4. Unfortunately the game is super laggy when you have a few pirates and captives roaming about. In the later stages of the game it got so bad that I had to turn all video options to low and still had the lag problems. I would have rated the game higher for fun factor but just couldn't enjoy it because of the slow motion capture effect that kept going on due to the lag of the game. Disappointed that this was the case, for the most part I had fun building the town and earning gold ect., just can't believe that MacSoft put together such a unpolished game."
4,It's no Tropico 1,"To start out, this game has no spoken Tutorial (which Tropico 1 does). System requirements aren't too steep. Gameplay is not as involving as T1. The bawdier elements of the game make it suitable for the middle school & over crowd. Overall this game left me feeling let down, and I really enjoyed the first Tropico. I give the game higher ratings because it is well done technically."
5,HILARIOUSLY FUNNY!,A must read for both actors and non-actors!!! Pretty helpful for aspiring actors as well!
3,Only used one bottle,Didn't make a big impression on me either way so didn't end up buying another bottle of Bee Propolis Capsules.
1,"Waste of time, money and brain cells","I love James Patterson. But this book is a HUGE flop. I agree with erickson. The best use for this book is as a door stop. I was so irritated by the hopping from topic to topic and randomness of everything that happened. I didn't want to finish the book, but I wanted to get my money's worth. I'm quite upset I spent the time I did attempting to read this book."
1,So disappointing from an author that has done much better,"Everyone loves the age old battle of good vs evil and contemplating the end of the world etc, but this story with leaps in plot and silly twists and I must smile here those perfect blue eyed saviors is just too funny for words. Please go back to serial killers in DC this just isn't your arena."
1,Terrible,I actually give this book 0 stars. I can honestly say it is the worst book I have ever read. I bought the hard cover and it was a total waste of money. I can't believe the same author wrote Jack and Jill.
3,Cradle and All,"I have read every book since Along Came a Spider plus a few of his earlier books. I am an Alex Cross fan and love Patterson's writing style. However, I think he should stick to the Alex Cross stories. He should leave the weird and strange to Stephen King and his fans. Cradle and all was a fast easy read but definitely not his best work."
1,Writing at its worst!,"This book is so bad, you would think it was wrtitten for someone who was working their way up to cheap romance novels. Story is silly and full of holes, no character development, and the writing - heres an example: ""He knelt before me and softly bowed his head. ""I love you with my heart and soul. I know that I'll love you for eternity. I have to leave the priesthood. Then, please marry me? he asked. I knelt and faced Justin. I wanted to be as close to him as I possibly could be. . .There are GREAT novels out there, please find them, and give your mind a treat, do not allow this piece of junk to even waste a second of your time."
3,Cradle and All,"Cradle and All took on the theme of the year 2000. Good vs Evil, the second coming and the end of the world as we know it.This is the story of two young girls of different cultures, who both claim to be pregnant but virgins. It's up to the world and the church to find out which one is carrying to true child of Christ. Because they know that one is surely carrying to child of Satan. Patterson takes you through many twists and turns and in the end you are still surprised."
4,"Other than the odd theology, a very entertaining book","1. if logic is important to folks, then forget this book because the entire premise, at least from a theological standpoint, just doesn't make any sense.2. with that being said, if the above isn't a problem (and in many respects why should it be because this is a work of fiction), then this book should appeal or at least be fairly entertaining to most folks. the dark and demonic aspects as well as some crude scenes may be disturbing to some, all in all, a very well written book and as a result--> very engaging and entertaining."
1,Now I know why this book was priced on an in house special,I was several chapters into this book thinking I must be missing the literary talent I enjoyed in the Alex Cross series...I could not put them down. Halfway into the book I was still scratchingmy head but thought I may as well work my way though it...acomplete waste of time for me. I will move on to Beach House and hope it is better!
1,A Very Disappointing Read,"This was possibly the worst Patterson I have read, and I have read them all...absolutely a waste of time...it read like a bad mass market paperback ""horror"" novel without the horror...Lets hope that when he returns from ""vacation"" he can take the time to bring us something better."
2,Audio version is lifeless.,"The story is narrated by one man and one woman, both of whom are very monotone and lack enthusiam in a story that definitely calls for excitement. In the story there are two young women, both of whom are pregnant despite the fact that they are virgins. The Vatican is saying that one of them is probably carrying the Saviour. Incredible! Yet I never feel any elation, confusion, fright, happiness or other emotion out of the narration. I think I need to go back and read the actual book."
3,Just Ok,This was a page turner as most of Patterson novels are but the story itself was ify and the ending was just far fetched (IMHO)
1,"""National Inquirer"" material","This story should have been serialized for the ""National Inquirer"" or one of the similar tabloids. It does not deserve to be a book."
1,Wake me up when it's over.,"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read. Like another reader, I read the whole thing, just HOPING it would get better. No such luck. It seems like all the characters are just driving around and circling the globe going back and forth between the ""virgins"". And, some characters are so useless they could have been completely left out. This is the only James Patterson book I've read, and if any of his other ones are like this one, it will be my last."
2,bizarre book,"Cradle and All was definitely not as good as some of Patterson's other works. This was by far the strangest of the ones I've read. I found it to be long and drawn out throughout much of the book. Towards the end of the book, the pace picked up and it became a little more interesting, but still not as good as his other books. It ended with quite an unexpted twist. If you have nothing else to read, go for it- but otherwise I'd try to find something more interesting to read."
2,You won't be reading long...,"It won't take you much time to work your way through James Patterson's newest (older) offering. While the fact that the story is framed within one of the greatest mysteries of life offers the reader the potential for a great read, the book simply does not deliver and leaves you shaking your head in disappointment when the last page has been turned. A VERY quick read, so the disappointment is mitagated to a great degree by the knowledge that so little time has been invested by both reader and author."
1,Waste of Time....,I have read all of James Patterson's books and look forward to them. This one was a big waste of time and money. I didn't care about the characters and the story line was disconnected at best. Where is Alex Cross when you need him?
1,It's Been Done Before.....,"I realized that this was a re-working of an earlier novel, but I thought I'd give it a shot anyway. It was simple and fast-paced, so I went ahead and finished it, but it was really a waste of time. The characters were one-dimensional, the plot-line has been done before (Omen, anyone?). My personal opinion - the ending of this book is ripe for ""sequel"". I THINK that J. Patterson wants to publish a sequel to this book. However, since the original ""Virgin"" was so poorly received it was re-packaged, and now gets to take advantage of his fame from ""Kiss the Girls"". NOW this book will be widely read enough to warrant a sequel.It seems to be all about the $buck$.....I hate to see someone profiting off mediocre work."
1,"NEXT TIME, JAMES, WRITE UNDER ANOTHER NAME","This book started off REALLY GOOD, but then it went south on me. By page 54, I was no longer reading the book, I was reading the back of my RECEIPT to see if I could return it... or at least exchange it for something more captivating. Like maybe, I don't know, something by Dr. Seuss?Summary: I've read James before and found him interesting. This wasn't James. This was someone else."
1,I could not believe that this was James Patterson,"I have always looked forward to the next James Patterson novel. Among my favorites were Cat and Mouse, Jack and Jill,and When the Wind Blows. I even gave him the benefit of the doubt on Pop Goes the Weasel, but Cradle and All was just inexcusable. The story had all kinds of promises that led to nowhere. I cannot express to you just how bad I thought this novel was--to the point that I'm considering e-mailing Patterson personally to refund my money. ... This novel was a bigger let-down than Hannibal."
1,What Happened?,"An unbelievable plot, plenty of stereotypes, an amateur work that leaves the reader wondering, ""Why?"" What happened? This is not what we have come to expect from James Patterson! A major disappointment!"
1,Disappointed,"This was such a disappointment! I had enjoyed other Patterson novels, particularly Along Came a Spider, Kiss the Girls. But something went wrong with this one. There was no character development, no depth to the plot. I felt I was reading an outline rather than a novel by a well published writer. I thought this was a silly story and a wasted read."
2,"Not Advertised as a ""Virgin"" Re-write","I thought the premise of this book seemed awfully familiar -- it's nothing but a remake of his earlier ""Virgin"" title, same exact story. Feel like I wasted money and effort, plus the book would be 100 pages smaller with the blank space squeezed out. Hardly a bargain! Beware."
1,Patterson's worst,"James Patterson is one of my favorite authors, but this book is perhaps his worst piece of work. Everyone I talked to said their was a big surprise ending, so for this reason, I kept reading. The ending was a surprise, I admit. My problem with the book is the subject matter/story line and I did not care for it very much. I kept thinking about the sacrilegious overtones throughout this book. It should of been billed as a work of science fiction."
4,Excellent,"I am not a James Patterson fan, but a friend was reading this book, and it sounded very interesting to me. I bought it, and loved it. It is the only book by him that I have ever cared to read, probably because it is so different from the rest of his work. I thought I had the book all figured out until the end. Those are the kind of books I love. This is one that you definetly do not want to read the end first, for it will ruin the whole book!"
4,Short but good,"The forces of good and evil converge. Two young virgin girls are both about to have a baby. One for good and one for evil. The church is not sure which one is which and therefore, moves to protect both until they can determine the evil one.The author builds on the reader's sympathy by making both girls highly likable. It is almost unthinkable that one of the two's babies will need to be destroyed. Great suspense!"
3,Not typical Patterson..,I read this book only because I've read just about all of James Patterson's book but I wasn't really impressed. The whole supernatural feel of the book wasn't quite what I had expected. I'm a fan of Patterson (Alex Cross series) but this one is definitely not staying on my top 20 list of keepers. Sorry Patterson.
1,Cradle and All - Not up to Patterson's Talent,"There's not a lot to say about this book. It's a lot of religeous mumbo-jumbo. Patterson would do better to leave this stuff to Steven King. If I had wanted to read about mysticism and the existance among us of devils, I would have read a King novel, which I have not done, for good reasons."
1,Bloody Awful,"Having enjoyed James Patterson's novels in the past, I was in for an unpleasant surprise upon reading ""Cradle and All"". Thank God that I checked it out from the Public Library; if I had actually purchased this book, at any price, I would even more p.o.'d than I already am. This thing reads like it was written by an untalented middle-schooler. It is really, really difficult to understand how this thing got published. Please, people, if you must read this book, check it out from your local Public Library, and do not waste any money on it. Even at a four-hour read, it is an inexcusable waste of time. Terrible plot, no character development, many factual errors, obvious ending... Well, I could go on and on. What a disappointment."
4,A pretty good read,"Although it was not very believable, there were aspects of the book that were very good. The fast-paced, suspenseful nature of the book deems it a quick read. It surely kept my interest and is enticing me to read another Patterson novel. This was my first. The twisted ending was fantastic and not expected at all. Not the greatest book in the world, but great enough to recommend to other readers."
3,"Good, but at times too much detail","I enjoy James Patterson books & look to devour them within days of their release. Being a major ""Cross"" fan, I am willing to try some of the other releases. I looked forward to reading this book because of the mystery involving the Catholic Church. Having been raised in the Church, I was interested in Patterson's approach. While I enjoyed the book overall, I could have done with a lot less...There was confusion about the meaning of the mysteries of Fatima without a whole lot of background to explain. So if you don't know about the mysteries, it can be a bit confusing. I would really enjoy reading the book this is a re-write of ""Virgin"", to see how the two compare. The jacket says Mr. Patterson is working on the next ""Cross"" mystery....I'm waiting with baded breath! Hope that one is a bit less.....confusing..."
1,Cradle and All,"James Patterson needs to stick to ""who-done-it"" novels and leave the Father, Son and Holy Ghost out of his writing. He's not good at it! I kept reading this book thinking it would get better. It didn't."
1,Not up to standards,I have read several of James Patterson's books and have enjoyed them all. I put down Cradle and All without finishing it however. This book was not up to the author's normal stadards in my opinion. Everyone's tastes are different and others may enjoy the book but I would not recommend the book.
1,Buyer Beware,"This book starts out badly and only gets worse. It's a complete waste of time and I almost quit reading halfway through it. This is the first James Patterson book with which I have been disappointed. If you really must read it, do yourself a favor and wait for the paperback."
1,God awful,"I love Patterson's books, but this was so terrible. I am writing this having only read 2/3 of the book. I'm not finishing it either. Stick to Alex Cross."
1,"Neat premise, but terrible execution, plot, and ending!","The only writer who should get any acclaims on this book is the one who wrote the jacket copy! It made me interested enough to read it (well, listen to the audio version anyway). There were so many plot holes and conflicting details. And it was creepy, rather then mysterious. Do not read... pick another Patterson book, ANY other!"
3,"It was a good listen, BUT....","Yes, it was a good listen on tape, but it was a disturbing and repulsive story. I tried to remember while listening that it was simply a fiction story and that Patterson was playing big time with religion. As a believer, I found it appalling and it left a really bad taste in my mouth. It was a most loathsome story. I really started to wonder about Patterson's personal beliefs, but then I thought, remember...this is just a story. Even the ending was most disgusting to me and I was surprised that Patterson wrote something like this. His Alex Cross and Murder Club books are superb...his characters wonderful, but this one is a real creeper. If you're a believer and know your Bible, don't bother with this one..."
2,Read this one last,"Vaugely entertaining and highly predictable, this was quite a disappointment. I love the Alex Cross series and most of Patterson's books.Today I was reviewing my orders, I saw this one in history, and had to pull up the description to remember if I'd gotten and read the book; that is not my normal reaction to a Patterson book. Wish I'd bought it used!"
1,I can't believe this is James Patterson!,"I am an avid James Patterson fan and was really looking forward to his latest release. However, as I continued to read this book, I kept waiting for it to get better. It didn't. A very disappointing read. Sorry."
1,Predictable,"I now can say I have read the worst James Patterson novel ever. I knew exactly what was going to happen each time I turned a page, to say the least I finished this book in no time. I remember a movie of the week being about this exact story, go figure. Please stay with Alex Cross, he is the only character that is truly interesting"
2,Patterson's Fall,"Recently Patterson has re-released two of his earlier novels, Cradle and All being a ""remake"" of Virgin. I have named Patterson as one of my favorite writers for the last 5 years and haven't hesitated to purchase any of his books upon their release. However, I will be quite hesitant to purchase his next release after reading this one. For those who are reading Cradle as your first Patterson-please read some of his previous work. Before his bough broke, Patterson was a spellbinding writer certain to captivate his audience."
1,Best use -- A Doorstop,"One of the worst books I have read. The story line is simplistic and disjointed with leaps of logic galore. Do not buy. Do not read. If received as a present, its best use is as a doorstop."
1,Pitiful and Tasteless,"This was a very contrived and manipulated plot. The sexual incidents bordered on soft porn, in addition to blaspheming sacred things. The style, vocabulary and literary features I long for in good reading were sorely missing. This is the first book I have read by the author and will be the last. When I finished the book, I tossed it in a trash can in front of my students. They were amazed. I simply said, ""if I want a little piece of steak I don't go to the bottom of a garbage can to find it."""
1,This was a BIG disappointment,"I've never read Patterson, so my disappointment wasn't that it didn't live up to his other novels; it just failed all around for me. The concept was great; that's why I bought it. (I'm one of the unfortunates who paid good money for the hardcover edition!)His writing didn't live up to the potential. I usually like straightforward easy-to-read prose, but this was too simplistic, way too expository, and I kept feeling like he was leading me by the hand and telling me what emotions I should experience; telling me when I should feel the tension. But if it were good writing, the writing itself would do this, and he wouldn't have to spell it out for me.I agree, too, that the characters were too flat and unrealistic. I finished it last night and was so glad to be done with it, but this morning I can barely remember the climax, that's how poor it was. It does look like he left it open for a sequel, but it would be a shame to waste the paper on it."
3,Had great promise but...,The story had great promise however the author just failed to deliver. Why are priests and nuns always falling in love? Not a bad book by any means however every time it starts bringing you to the edge of your seat it falls on its face. Perhaps Patterson should leave the horror/supernatural stuff to authors named King!
1,cradle and all,"What a disappointment. Waited 8 weeks for book at the library, and it is terrible. Please Mr Patterson, bring back Alex Cross and stay with him."
1,Cradle and All,"What a disappointment! I kept reading because I thought it would get better. I do not recommend it at all--Especially disappointing because rather than not wanting to put it down I never felt like picking it up. It would have been better had it been kept out of print. Shame, Mr. Patterson. Let's get on with your normal thrillers!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I'm an avid Patterson fan and this is my first review. After having read all the Alex Cross books, I decided to try the others. I'm sorry I wasted my time with this one. It was mysterious, but confusing and somewhat heretical to me. I stayed with it to the end but was disappointed."
1,Disappointment,"This is my first review given to any book and I am especially sad to give only one star to James Patterson, I always like his books. I was excited when I got the Kindle verson of the book downloaded and started to read right away. I almost wanted to stop 1/3 into the book but I finished it just skipping chapters. I was so disappointed as the book dragged on and on with no purpose and the plot made no sense. The ending is awful as well."
5,Non-offended Christian,"I am a devout Catholic and I found this book thoroughly entertaining. It was my very first book of Patterson's I read back when I was in middle school and I have read it multiple times over simply for the enjoyment of the plot line. Let's be honest folks, it's a book, a work of fiction. If you're looking for accurate details and a sweet bedtime story filled with pretty scenes and sugar-coated fantasies, then none of Patterson's books are for you. Take it with a grain of salt and enjoy an edge-of-your-seat book about something all Christians wonder about: Christ's second coming."
4,Good vs. Evil not bad,I liked this book eventhough there were senarios that did not seem realistic. This is a fictional story. So some of it is not possible and makes the story less interesting. I really liked the two characters working together and fighting their urges of love.
1,Cradle and All,"Who really wrote this book? I find it hard to believe this novel was written by James Patterson. The voice of the author is clearly not his. Maybe that of an overwrought seminarian, or, perhaps a much younger version of the author. The story would be interesting were its premise not so outdated. An intact virgin delivers a baby? It happens all the time with nary a blink from the Vatican or anyone else. I expect much better from James Patterson and feel cheated. C'mon, who wrote this book?"
1,save your money,"If your like me and a big time reader, you have your favorite authors. Patterson is one of mine. I have enjoyed his novels and have purchased them all to date. Unfortunately that includes ""Cradle and All."" Save your money, fellow readers. Mr Patterson slipped out of his genre and the change did us no service. You'll fall asleep before page 12; you can skip pages, paragraphs, etc, and never miss a thing....its been done before, better. Do us all a favor, Mr Patterson, and leave these sorts of things to Mr King and Mr Kootz, nobody does it better."
2,It's Not Kiss the Girls,"I found a copy of Kiss the Girls in a box of old paperbacks recently, and read it in one day. It's such a well written and suspenseful book, I took my birthday McLean and Eakin gift certificate and went on a quest to read another James Patterson. I think I picked the wrong one. Cradle and All is a very predictible story, focused more on the religious aspects of this ""investigation"" into virgin births instead of developing a compeling story. I quickly figured out at least one side of the story and was very disappointed at the ""revelation."" If you want to read exciting religious fiction, choose Left Behind. I'm busy looking for another story like Kiss the Girls."
3,Save your money...,"buy this book as a used paper back instead of shelling out the full price for hardback. There isn't much about this book to like.The story of 2 virgins who happen to get pregnant at the same time. Which virgin carries the new savior and which carries the devil's child? Most of this story is spent bouncing back and forth between the U.S. and Ireland as Patterson trieds, unsuccessfully, to build suspense for the reading by telling the story from both points of view of the virgins. Why can't either one remember how she got pregnant? What forces keep attacking the priest who are trying to find out who has the good child?In the end most of it is nothing but filler with a couple of twist at the end. You'd be better off reading his newest novel, ""1st To Die""."
2,Big Disappointment,"I ha ve read every book Patterson has written and so therefore did not bother to read the back of the jacket for storyline. I just never could wait for his books to go on sale. This book is not for everybody, so if you are a Patterson fan and expect this to be his usual style, read the jacket first and see if this is your style. I won't give up on him, I will just be careful from here forward."
1,Giant Disappointment,"This is the sort of book that would never have been published if the author wasn't already established. The premise, about the possibility of a modern virgin birth, is interesting enough to attract attention, but the conclusion veers off into the realm of science fiction, or worse, so this work should not even be considered a ""novel"" or ""mystery"" in the normal sense of those words. The only reason I kept reading this book was my prior experience with this author's writings, and my hope he would start displaying his usual talent in story-telling, but the more I read, the more disappointed I was. The whole reading experience with this work was a complete waste of time, and I will have to think twice before I read any more his his coming works. Don't disappoint yourself with this book. Read his older works if interested in mysteries, but definitely skip this failure."
1,Disappointed,I have read all of James Patterson's books and I found this one so out of character (probably spoiled by the wonderful Alex Cross books) that I was extremely disappointed. It was surreal and the plot (good vs. evil) has already been done to death. The ending was predictable and he takes short chapters to the extreme. It seemed like every other page was blank. I love every book that Patterson has ever written but this struck me as beneath his talents.
4,A in your face story with a break-neck speed,"I'm a die-hard James Patterson fan and I would like to say this book wasn't at all what I expected. I think this book had a great plot and ideas but after reading the book I'd realized some of it was a bit chessy. James Patterson has a way of writing that when you read his books you are so involved that anything that you read might be ridiculous end up fitting into the story very well. The idea of two pregnant virgins of emaculation conception, one having the child of Christ and the other of Lucifer was, in my eyes, surprising!! To be honest, I feel the ending could of been better. Other than that, I can't wait for the continuation of this story"
1,Cradle and All,One of the worst books I have ever read. I hope a good author like James Patterson has not prostituted himself in his quest to make a buck. I threw the book away as I could not bring myself to give it to another reader.
1,Awful,"I echo many of the others who have posted reviews. Among other faults Patterson cannot ""get"" women. The character of the investigator Anne Fitzgerald is so wooden it was painful. The only characters that had any liveliness to them were the two virgins. Unfortunately, I spent money to buy my copy. Don't make the same mistake that I did!"
1,I very big disappointment for a huge James Patterson fan . .,"I have several James Patterson books including the entire Alex Cross series, which was absolutely wonderful. This book tells that tails of disease, famon, and two virgin births. This book dives into the story of the Virgin mother of Jesus, Mary today in the 21 century. One child would be born the Son of God and the other the Son of Satan. Once again we have the epic story of good against evil with all of its flavor. It only took me two days read this book and I am sorry that I even did. It will keep you because you will want to know which baby is which, but other than that, this book is for the birds . . . . sorry James Patterson. Give me Alex Cross or give me death . . . . ."
2,Barely bearable....,"I have been a huge James Patterson fan for many years now. Actually, I should say an Alex Cross fan, as I am usually disappointed with Mr. Patterson's non-Alex Cross work. This book was no different. Reworked from his previous novel Virgin, Cradle and All starts out slowly and doesn't go much faster from there. At times it was hard to understand as I thought I was missing something, but in actuality I wasn't. I didn't grow close to any of the characters as I do in the Cross books but that's a benefit of a series.Short chapters (as is Patterson's usual style) and wondering when the heck things will pick up are the only 2 things that kept me in this book. My advice is to either wait for the paperback or get this second-hand. It is worth finishing (if you bother to start) as things work themselves out and provide a fairly decent ending to a drawn out book."
1,Total Waste of Money!,"This book was a great disappointment to me. The characters were two-dimensional and the plot was thin. It was more like a mediocre short story he had ""stretched"" into book length. I haven't read the original ""Virgin"" that he ""reworked"" to produce this book, but he should have left well enough alone. In my opinion, it was not believable and it was not a thriller. I found it to be a rather repulsive work churned out for commercial reasons only. I feel that to a religious person it would be offensive, and to a non-religious person it would be an insult to the intelligence. The only reason I gave it one star was that I couldn't give it any LESS than that."
1,Will you print this?,"As a former, avid reader of this author, I am insulted by this garbage! An author who could write a spine chilling, totally involving book like Along Came a Spider, and invent a compelling character such as Gary Sonenji, should be ashamed to put his name on this. We, myself and lots of others, bought it because we believed in James Patterson. I won't anymore. The topic is convoluted, and too many loose ends are left unresolved. The ending is ridiculous! I kept reading, hoping for things to have some redemption, making all the words become worthwhile. It never happened. Seldom, if ever, have I been so disappointed in such a long-awaited book!"
1,An insult to my intelligence,"I was very disappointed in this book, I kept hoping it would get better, but in the final pages, where we end up with yet another ""virgin"" pregnant: that was the last straw. I can't believe that I read the ""whole thing"""
1,Disappointing!,"What a disappointment! I bought the ""newest"" James Patterson book eager to read the next of his fascinating and challenging stories. I was unhappy that it wasn't an Alex Cross novel, but I was willing to give it a chance. Well, I read it, but I can't believe it! I feel cheated. This ""novel"" could only have grown out of a parochial education and a juvenile fixation on ""The Exorcist."" I think Mr. Patterson decided to take the year off, but allowed his publisher to issue a ""reworked"" story - making money on his established named, but definately NOT considering his readers. I'm sorry for anyone whose first introduction to James Patterson was Cradle and All. If it was my first, it would also be my last."
1,Usually a great Patterson fan.,"The best thing about this book is it's length. With very short chapters of 2 to 3 pages and half empty pages at the beginning and end of these chapters to stretch it out, this book is a very fast read. It is not your usual Patterson. It lacks everything that is usually found in his books. I did read it all the way through hoping that it would improve as it progressed. This did not happen. All the characters seemed to be shallow and unlikeable and the plot strange because key points such as the plagues of illnesses were unexplained and vague. The ending seemed to be condradictory-if the Devil's child survived the drowning, why did the plagues end? And who found him and raised him with no publicity? Surely a new born baby saved from the ocean would make headlines even in the Irish countryside."
1,Not his best work.,"Patterson should stick to detective stories and leave the supernatural stuff to authors like Steven King, Ann Rice, etc. The book is predictable, boring and not the typical Patterson read. Its one thing for an author to go off the beaten path and write something different for a change but better to stick with what they know works. I would rather wait a year before his next publication then to read a book of this genre. He's out of his element on this one."
2,disappointment,"I was waiting in anticipation for this book, to find out it was a disappointment, if it had been my first Patterson book I would not have read another. I found you could not get close to the characters, the scenes jumped around to much."
2,Second-guessing God,"Thid novel is a formula pot boiler. I have read and enjoyed the stories involving Alex Deleware for years, but this story reads like Patterson's bills have all come due at once and he had to do someing in a hurry. Please, Jim, go back to what you do so well. Forget about rewriting the Bible!"
1,IS THIS SUMMER READING?,"THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORSE BOOKS I HAVE EVER WRITTEN. IT MADE NO SENSE, THE PLOT WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BELIEVING AND THE ENDING WAS EVEN WORSE. I THINK MR. PATTERSON HAD AN EVIL TWIN WHO WROTE THIS BOOK FOR HIM."
1,First Page/Last Page,"I could have read the first page and then the lat page and known the whole story. Too bad, because I really like Patterson. He usually writes great stories. But I guess everyone can have a bad day."
1,"Madonna - Like a ""Virgin""","If books were songs, this warmed over turkey of a novel would be the old Madonna hit song. Repackaged early Patterson is selling well, but it should be selling like the original, Virgin, did when it first appeared in 1980. Poorly. This book is definitely a don't bother -- the characters are neither believable nor likeable, and the plot is thin and far out. James Patterson's body of work work since Kiss the Girls deserves the best-seller status it always enjoys. Too bad this re-hash doesn't. Life is so short, and there are so many books. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,I could tell where the commercials would play...,"Wow. As I read this disappointing release, I couldn't help thinking that I was reading an only slightly fleshed-out TV Movie of the Week script. I had been expecting the typical Patterson/Alex Cross-ian suspense and character development, and got nothing but a superficial good vs. evil sparring match. Like a previous reviewer, I finished the book only because I had paid $20 for it!..."
2,Alex Cross fans beware!,"I bought this book hoping to spend a few hours wrapped in a mystery. I got it alright! It was a mystery to me how James Patterson could get away with writing this! The entertainment of the novel involved only in finding out which girl was the true virgin. It is a very quick read. The number of pages in the book is deceiving as the print is so large I could read it without my glasses. If you are a fan of detective mystery's, dont waste your time or money on this book. If you like John Saul you might enjoy it."
1,Poorly done,I literally threw this book across the room because it was so bad. There is so much wasted time on inconsequential characters and scenes and the ending makes you guess his editor just told him to wrap it up. I will never waste my time on a Patterson book.
2,Hoping this is not typical Patterson....,"This was my first James Patterson novel and although I have always heard good things about his writing, I was just not impressed with this. I felt there was no depth to the characters and I found that I just didn't care what happened to them. Instead of being absorbed into the storyline, I was continually thinking about how flat the writing was. The story itself could have been entertaining and perhaps even a little powerful in the hands of a different writer, but I ended up skipping ahead just to find out the ending in which I held only a mild curiosity. From what I have read in other reviews, this is one of his earlier works so I am hoping that his newer books will be much better."
3,Mildly entertaining summer novel,"Being a fan of James Patterson, I was pretty disappointed with Cradle and All. It was a well-written story, but that doesn't mean the plot and character development were good. They left a lot to be desired. The story was definitely gripping in the sense that you wanted to see what happened at the end, but so much background material was left out (purposefully?) that one could not help but wonder if Patterson was simply trying to ""write a movie."" This book could easily be made into a screenplay with a lavish budget, A-list stars, and ultimately, box office disaster. Still, if you have a few hours to kill, this is a mildly entertaining religious mystery novel."
1,Terrible,"This is my first James Patterson novel and probably my last if the rest of his stuff is like this!!! I found it to be very disturbing. Obviously, this man can not possibly be a Catholic-Priests lusting after nuns, priests lusting after young girls and boys, nuns lusting after priests....just gross! Do yourself a big favor and skip this one."
4,Riveting,"This book should be read by all existing James Patterson fans, and even Patterson virgins. I received it on a Friday afternoon and was finished by Saturday morning. I then passed it on to my boyfriend who returned it to me, finished, on Sunday. So far this wonderful book has done the rounds of 6 of my friends.While cynics will inevitably draw comparisons with the 1999 film ""End of Days"", Cradle and All tackles the favorite subject of the millenium with considerably more aplomb. And while the ""twisty"" ending may be predictable to some, I would still implore any fans of fiction writing to read this book. Superb."
2,Review of Cradle and All,"Cradle and All was a very disappointing read for me. I have read most of Patterson's books and really enjoyed them, always anxious for the next one to come out. This time I feel like I wasted my money."
4,Patterson Makes You Think,"I found this book to be chilling and want to run out and go to church. I just finished it, and wow, does he make you think. This is a book about good and evil, and while it does seem a bit drawn out, the end is worth it."
1,Not worth the rewrite,"Find a good used book store and look for a copy of ""Virgin."" Much better book. The changes in the two versions aren't interesting or compelling enough to justify the rewrite. The change to first person (Anne) and the change in the ending were just plain stupid. It's a fast read, for sure - chapters are short short short. Each chapter changes location and viewpoint character, which fragments the story unduly. Overall, I'd have to say that ""Cradle and All"" and ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" (the most recent Alex Cross book) aren't worthy of Mr. Patterson and certainly not worth the price of the hardbacks."
1,Cradle and All,The second book by this author of this type - Patterson should stick to story lines that feature Alex Cross. At least those novels have a probable plot.
1,"Amateurish, one dimensional effort","This is the last time I invest in a James Patterson hardback. I didn't even finish When the Wind Blows, but thought I would give this book a chance anyway. About three chapters into it, I went looking for the date it was written because it so clearly is amateurish. Realized at that time that it was a rewrite of a 1980 book. Re-releases of earlier books by a popular author are usually disasters, intended only to capitalize on the author's present fame. This book's characters are one-dimensional and the bleating of the main characters becomes incredibly boring after just a few chapters. The dialogue reminded me of cheap romance novels. A waste of time and dollars. I felt ripped off by the publisher and the author. Never again."
2,Anger provoking,"I really don't know who to be angrier with - James Patterson for writing this mess or myself for reading it. I have his entire collection of novels but this is one I will put on the shelf with great reluctance. Without spoiling the ending, let me say it was totally unbelievable. As for all that comes before that, well, let's just say this. While the tension and suspense is there I was continually berating myself for continuing to read it. Anne is a one-dimensional ex-nun who cannot admit she loves a priest. The parents might as well be non-existent and the girls (virgins) just gave me the creeps. The boyfriend is a jerk while Father Rossetti is something out of ""The Exorcist"". And not even as believable. Please James, go back to Alex Cross and do not look back. This books must have be one of those tucked in a drawer for a dry spell filler. Doesn't work."
3,"bronwyn author of ""if The Price is Right""","I purchased this book because it was a #1 best seller in my local grocery store, and I liked the synopsis. What criteria is used to determine why a book is rated a #1? The novel had great promise.....good vs evil, our savior vs our destructor, the end of the world or the beginning of hope for mankind? However, it was just too unrealistic, and the ""female"" savior theme just didn't fly? I too have read Patterson's novel with the Alex Cross character, and I liked those much better. The novel was good enough to read, but not good enough to be a #1 best seller!"
2,"A decent Saturday read, but...","You'll devour it in a day, but that doesn't mean you'll feel satisfied. You probably expect rapid-fire chapters and paper-thin characters from Patterson, but you probalby also expect some real suspense. The quasi-religous, who-is-the-real-mother-of-the-savior schtick does keep you turning the pages, but it's not exactly true thriller stuff.Anyway, pick it up, read it in a day, and then move on to better thrillers like those of the similarly-named but significantly stronger thriller author Richard North Patterson."
1,Don't waste your time,This is not an Alex Cross book. It starts out wierd and never improves. The only reason we bought this was because we have enjoyed several others that Patterson wrote. Stick to his mysteries.
2,cradle and all,Did not care for this book. Was not up to Patterson style. I hope this is not the avenue he plans to go down with the new book in Nov. that he mentions in his bio.
4,You Can't Be Mind Blowing All The Time,"Okay this wasn't one of James Patterson's greatest creations, and it was a little silly. But I have to admit that I couldn't put it down without thinking about the possible outcomes. The story was unbelievable but the James Patterson suspence and twists were there. The main character, Anne, the former nun was believable but for her belief in virgin births. I'm a great fan of James Patterson and his Alex Cross serial is second to none, but give the guy a break, he can't be amazing all the time and every writer comes out with a turkey every now and then. So lets forgive this amazing writer for his one error in judgement and wait with fingers crossed for his next scorcher. I mean come on even when he does a turkey he does it better than any one else."
3,Interesting premise that only partially delivers,"I was excited about reading this book when I read the premise. I am a fan of Patterson and I find him an enjoyable and quick read. Don't look for too much character build-up or wordy prose and you won't be disappointed. This book starts off promisingly and seems to drag in the middle, but the ending is exciting and suspenseful and offers an interesting twist. All in all, not a bad two day read."
1,"I normally love Patterson, but............","This ""might"" have made an acceptable short story, but this story was really boring. Read the first twenty pages, the last twenty pages and it will still have seemed to long. Shallow characters, boring plot...Too much... I usually love books by James Patterson. This is the first one that I returned to a book store."
1,Atypical writing,"This book was not reflective of Patterson's typical writing style. I was bored to tears and regretted sitting for 2 hours reading it. There was no suspense, and the idea of the book was very offensive to me."
1,WEAK EFFORT,"SORRY GUYS: NOT VINTAGE PATTERSON: THE DEJA VU FEELING IS FOR PATTERSON READERS DEFINITIVE: VIRGIN WAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT NOT MUCH BETTER TREATMENT. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO WARM TO ANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS BOOK. THEY ALL SEEMED ""WRITTEN"" NOT ""LIVING"". THE PLOT SEEMED RATHER TIRED, AND WHAT IS UP WITH THE 3 PAGES PER CHAPTER SYSTEM OF WRITING? I THINK IT KEPT THE BOOK FROM DEVELOPING A FLOW. LOVE ALL PATTERSON, NOT JUST THE ""CROSS"" WORKS; BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE FILLER UNTILL THE NEXT ""CROSS"" NOVEL; A REAL (EXPENSIVE) LETDOWN."
1,Expectedly Disappointed,"Mr. Patterson's Alex Cross novels are wonderful, fast paced and exciting. So when ""Hide and Seek"" came out I expected more of the same, I was sadly mistaken. Thus I purchased ""Cradle and All"" with reservation when realizing Alex would not make an appearance.I was expectedly disappointed with this book. I don't care for teen horror/scream films, which this felt the literary equivalent to. No real surprises and no unforseen plot twists. Although I only spent 1 day reading this book it felt like a waste of my time.Unfortunately I will no longer purchase a James Patterson novel unless it has Detective Cross in it. Too many books, too little time to waste on novels such as ""Cradle and All""."
1,Patterson at his worst,"The book is a wonderful example of the adage ""You can fool all of the people all of the time."" The book is a poorly written rewrite of his ""Virgin"" which was not very good the first time around. My wife and I generally enjoy James Patterson. He is a capable writer who usually has believable plots, interesting characters, and enough suspense to keep me turning the book's pages. Cradle and All is an embarrassment to both the reader, who has been duped, and to Patterson who agreed to revive this previously told tale. His editor at Little Brown should be relieved of his or her handling of Patterson. Patterson's fans are going to be suspect of his future work."
2,This cradle should fall,"Abgd Rvw...I must concur with the majority on this book. James Patterson's work in the fantasy genre is terrible. The story moves quick enough but thats not enough to make this book good. The brevity of the chapters along with the unbelievability of the story the way it was written, would have made this book easy to pass up. Had I believed all the reviews and that Mr. Patterson could write this bad I would have passed it up.Recommend...No purchase"
1,AFTER THE FACT PULP,"IN LIGHT OF THE LAST SECRET OF FATIMA BEING REVEALED PREVIOUS TO THE RELEASE OF THIS BOOK, THE PUBLISHER AND AUTHOR SHOULD HAVE ""DEEP SIXED"" THIS POOR EXCUSE FOR A NOVEL! HAD I KNOWN THAT THE BOOK ALLUDED TO THE FATIMA SECRETS FALSELY, I WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT IT."
4,Great for a Change,"I am a really Alex Cross fan, however I really enjoyed Cradle and All. Just as Patterson's When the Wind Blows was a step away from his norm so is this book. I like to see authors take this kind of chance. I read this book in just over three hours because I had to find out who was going to have the good child and who was going to have the evil. The book did have major religous issues but they did not get in the way of the book. In fact I felt that they had to be there. Cradle and All takes some twist and turns when you least expect them. I was taken by surprise at the end of the book, but upon reflection it makes perfect sense. Patterson did leave the end open to a sequel. I for one will look forward to reading it if he does write one. If you like James Patterson, I believe that you will enjoy this book. It is a great change for him."
1,Big Disappointment,"After totally enjoying Patterson's Alex Cross series, I was greatly disappointed with his newest novel, that continued in his tradition of nursery rhyme-lines as titles. Patterson's characters were believable, but the entire context of the novel was definitely not up to the mark. I have read nearly all of Patterson's books and would continue to be interested in reading his future ones, but this book was my very least favorite."
2,If you have nothing better to do!,"It was almost like this author was paid to plug other books, movies and music. There are so many mentions of other popular pastimes.. I started to wonder if it was just an ad campaign. Besides all the problems other reviewers have listed.. I found just this one more. Basically it is Readable.. but totally disappointing!.. The idea of the two virgins got me to buy the book.. there was so much to do with the topic.. I can't believe the author just dropped the ball!"
2,Too religious,The book spends way too much time locked in anecdotal Christian dogma. It could be a good tale if it could stand on its own without the single correct religion theme that story relies on so heavily._christian
1,Patterson hits rock bottom with this one,"This work by James Patterson is dreadful. The author, whose Alex Cross novels were once eagerly awaited by his legions of fans, has continued his downward spiral by publishing a story so moronic that one wonders if he has lost his imagination to write books that his fans will enjoy. The premise here is about two young women who are virgins and suddenly find themselves in the family way without carnal knowledge of men. Each girl is carrying a child, one is blessed and one is cursed with the child of Satan. There is a moral clash of sorts between the female narrator, a former nun, and a priest, and the two carry on a running affair that is by turns unrequited love, hatred, indifference and deep devotion. It may be that Patterson had the film ""Rosemary's Baby"" in mind when he penned this novel but the book lacks cohesion and credibility and is totally forgettable."
1,Run Away! Run Away!,"I don't even know where to begin on this one. I will just say this, Patterson is a much better writter of detective thrillers. This book is so bad that words can't even describe it. Stay away from this stinker."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This was possibly the worst book I've ever read. With all the wonderful books out there, do not waste one moment of your life on this one."
1,Cradle and All into the Garbage,"I have never read a James Patterson book before and will never waste my money on another one. It was full of filthy language and disgustingly graphic sex. I took the audio version on a trip to listen to as the miles went by and by the end of the 2nd tape I dumped it into the next rest area garbage can. It really gagged me and after thinking that things might improve, I could stand no more. Wish I had read some of the customer reviews before spending the money."
1,A Long Wait for Nothing,"I finally got my hands on ""Cradle and All,"" thinking I would love it after reading the premise of the story. I'm a big fan of Stephen King, and enjoy most books about mysterious, supernatural events. I flipped through the (extremely) short chapters, waiting for the story to come together. Waiting to care about the characters. Waiting for a conclusion that made sense... A long wait for nothing. Readers, don't waste your time with this one. A one star rating is too high."
2,Not his best,"I've read practically every James Patterson novel, and this was certainly not his best. I love the Alex Cross series and most of his other works because they keep you guessing throughout the entire book. This novel, on the other hand, pretty much tells you the catch and simply repeats itself over and over from Part 2 until the ending. It was so messy that the act of reading it gradually became annoying. It is, however, a quick read (I finished it in less than a week) so even if it is a terrible novel, it doesn't waste too much of your time. By the way, the only reason that I give this book 2 stars and not 1 is because it did have a mildly ammusing epilogue."
2,Good Premise - Disappointing Outcome,"I found this book frustrating. The premise of the two virgin births and the two detectives attempting to divine (pun intended) the truth was promising and intriguing. But it jumped around too much, the characters weren't as well developed as I would have liked, and there were a few too many unsubstantiated leaps of illogic. And the rather obvious setup for a sequel at the end left me feeling unsatisfied.I also found the structure of a bazillion 1-2 page chapters irritating. Nothing was ever finished before moving on to the next chapter. It felt like amateur hour. I've not read any of Patterson's Alex Cross books, but I did read the similarly quirky ""When The Wind Blows"", which I liked much better. If you're thinking about starting up with Patterson, this ain't the place to do it."
1,I Should have known better..........,"Well, I thought I would never say it, but.....this was the worst book that I have ever read! I didn't think that James Patterson was capable of writing such junk!He has tried to mix religion with the occult...didn't work! He researched the Catholic Church pretty well, but didn't give enough credit to the faith of those folks.....the very idea that there would be another virgin birth...hey, why did you go there? I thought after the children that were able to fly was written he would settle down .... didn't happen did it?Stick to Alex Cross, James........you're good there!"
1,There's nothing new here,"I usually read the back cover of a book before I purchase it. However, in the lone exception of James Patterson I refrain from doing that because he always entertains with something new and original and I don't want to ruin the surprise; That is until ""Cradle and All."" I read this book almost ten years ago. Patterson wrote ""Virgin"" in 1980. Same plot, same locations, some derivations from the original. Save your money and get ""Virgin"" from the public library. No more blind faith for me... sorry Mr. Patterson, in the future, I'll review the story and determine if it's something new, before I take out my credit card."
1,I can't believe that I read the whole thing!,"I can't believe that I read the whole thing. What kept me reading? There was a good degree of suspense. I wanted to see if I was right about the ending. It was so very predictable with poorly developed characters. I thought Anne had potential as a nun turned private investigator, but in the end... Some of the reactions about the Catholic Church might have had a basis in reality hundreds of years ago, but I doubt that the hierarchy or the people of the Church would react that way now. I haven't read a book this bad in a long time."
1,Boring,A friend of mine loaned me this book and told me it was a great thriller and suspenseful..so I really had high hopes for this book. I found it to be predictable and boring. His descriptions of Boston and New York were believable but when they took the story overseas I don't think he did much research. I also thought some of the adjectives he used to describe people were overdone. I really really really hated this book and I only read it all the way through just to get it over with. It only took me a few hours to breeze through it anyway. When I finally got to the end I was quite annoyed at the lame ending...all that build up for nothing!
2,Not a Typlical Patterson,"I just recently finished reading Cradle and All, and must admit that I was reading through it like a mad woman just to find out what happened, but all in all, I was diappointed in the book. Patterson did not portray the usual realistic Mystery book of his usual writing. This book brings in a bit of the supernatural and religious world that makes it more of a fiction ""Fiction"" book. Now, I am a a Catholic Christian, and do have thoughts of the end of the world, but this plot of the book does not make me by into the story. Also, the cover reading of the book doesn't really illude to this interaction with the mystery. Good book, but wouldn't recommend it."
4,"Very different for Patterson, but GOOD","James Patterson is one of my favorite, no HE IS MY FAVORITE author and this is my first review for him. I've read all the ALEX CROSS novels and can't wait for ROSES ARE RED, I've also read Hide and Seek, When the wind blows, Midnight Club, and See HOW THEY RUN.Cradle AND ALL is about 2 virgin births, one in Ireland and one In America. Patterson takes on 1st person at Anne Fitzgerald a former nun and now turned Private EYE. She along with the VATICAN ( a priest named Rosetti and another named Justin O'Carroll) have to judge which is a true VIRGIN birth or if one will birth Satan and the other will be the second coming of Jesus. I loved the ending to this book , very shocking and you want more. Plus it is a very fast read. If you are or aren't a Patterson fan, you'll love this book"
3,A Quick Read and a Good Story,"I found this book extemely easy to read, and the story was entertaining. While this is certainly not Kiss the Girls or Along Came a Spider, it is a good choice if you are looking for something that flows well and is easy to digest."
1,cradle and all,"A complete waste of time. The plot is simple and you quickly know how it will end. His other books are great, this is a remake that shouldn't have happened"
1,Patterson - You stole my money!,"If I would have known that this book was a rewrite of a book Patterson wrote 12 years ago, I never would have bought it. Then I read it. Oh, how awful. I really do love Alex Cross, even when he gets bad reviews. But this was an abomination. Two women who are virgins are pregnant...one possibly with a newborn Christ and the other with the devil. Sorry, this just didn't fly with me. I have enjoyed novels that dealt with Catholicism, (The Genesis Code, etc.) but this was totallyboring. The only reason I finished it in 2 days was to go on to my other favorite authors who had books released the same day. James, Alex Cross is your best bet. Plot a story and stop relying on your name to sell a book."
2,No Trimmings with this Turkey Dinner!,"Reading this book was like sitting down to a tantalizing turkey dinner without being able to eat any of the trimmings. When all you get is turkey, it's not a great meal. Patterson didn't flesh out his characters enough. The idea behind the story is intriging, but underdeveloped in the final product. I was disappointed by the fact that this was not a new book, but a rewriting. Reading to the end was an effort, but I was pleased with the little twist at the very end of the story. This book gets 2 stars, but then I'm easy to please."
1,"Wasted effort, wasted time!","This was the first time I read a Patterson book and I was very disappointed. I put too much faith in reviews of his previous work. Although the book raised some interesting issues that are relevant today, the author could have accomplished the same thing writing an op-ed commentary."
3,Cradle and All,"I would give this book a very mixed review. I have read all of James Patterson's books and would agree that Alex Delaware is his niche. The story line for 'Cradle' is very good, but the prose lacks the quality that Mr. Patterson is certainly capable of. I do not understand the need for 112 chapters in a 300 pg. book. I found this very distracting and caused a lack on continuity.As I said, the story line is good, but Stephen King could have taken this story and with his descriptors, built a much more enjoyable read. I just can't get away from the thought that this book resembles 'See Jane run', but with a better plot line. :) Sorry Mr. Patterson."
1,not what i expect from patterson,"this book was way out there. i have heard that it is a ""take-off"" of sorts to a previous novel that he had written...i skipped it(the only one)...and i should have skipped this one, too. in all honesty, i am more than half way through and in no rush to pick it back up. patterson is probably my favortie author at the time, but i am so disappointed in this book. i was so anxious for it to come out, even though i have to admit the subject matter did concern me. i did have some faith that he could pull it off. i think he needs to get back to alex cross and other criminal matters, rather than the catholic church. storylines invloving religon are too difficult to pull off, doesn't come off believable. i give the book one star just because james patterson wrote it! hope the next one is better."
2,Not to good,"being a avid Patterson fan, I just grabbed it and read. Some mistake, I found it to be of non-interest and luckily it was short, as was my attention span. Everyone has to experience mistakes, including great writers. This will not change my readings of Mr. Patterson, I will just hope I never encounter another like this one."
1,Lackluster if that,"As a big fan of Alex Cross and Patterson's mysteries, I picked this one up with great anticipation. I was sorely disappointed. This clearly reads as a work that Patterson wrote very early in his career. As I described it to my husband, ""Don't bother - Nothing happens - there are supposedly two virgins bearing the child of god and the child of satan - one has the child of satan, the other turns out to be the victim of a crime, and then (surprise!) there is a third virgin. And she has the daughter of god...."" I kept waiting for the horrific scientific explanation, or ACTUAL conflict to ensue between good and evil. Or for the characters to do something that made them likable and interesting. Alas, I made it to the end of the book by sheer perserverance, and was never satisfied."
4,Cradle and All,"I have just become a fan of James Patterson. I thought Cradle and All was written very well. I like how Mr. Patterson uses religion in this novel. The fight between God and the devil is intensely portrayed. Being Catholic, I felt the story was very realistic. I cannot wait to read his next book!"
3,Good and a half,"This is pretty straight forward early 1970s rock with some absolutely amazing guitar work. The vocals are also excelentIf there is a drawback to Glass Harp, and this is subjective, is that they are too heavily orchrestrated. They are undisputably great players playing what could have been amazing roots rock. With instrumental command this strong, why the heavy arrangements?This music could stand unshakable on just bare bones."
2,Might want to investigate other options,"There's nothing horribly wrong about the Prestwick House 'Side-by-Sides' edition of Macbeth, for the most part it gets the job done. I am, however, disappointed with it myself and would recommend looking at other publishers' editions for modern translation of Shakespeare.Because instead of translating Shakespearean English into modern English, the Prestwick House edition just transliterates it - moves the words around to form a modern sentence structure, drops in a few synonyms for out-of-date words, and changes punctuation.Now for most of the book, this works fine. But sometimes the language needs more of an interpretation than is given, and that, as they say, the rub.Plus the thing is riddled with typographical errors. Come on, you're selling this to an education market! Do a little editing!All-in-all I'd look elsewhere for a modern Shakespeare translation. But using this one won't be the end of the world."
4,Handy little thing,"First, it did not better my golf performance, surprised ?. I am puffing and moaning a little bit less than usual at end of round.Very compact when folded. Would have liked that front wheel had been a swivel type.Miss brake handle to control stops instead of brakes pedals on each wheel. I can't get used to release the brakes pedals on each wheel when setting off, to the amusement of fellow players. I guess that's not a technical problem, rather due to something between my ears ...."
5,I was using the wrong side!,"Good paper, though not a whole lot of texture. At first, I was really disappointed with the results. Dull color, yellow paper. I put it away for a while and went back to using Epson Enhanced Matte paper. Well, one day I needed to print something and I was all out of the matte paper, so I gave this watercolor paper another try. Turns out I was using the wrong side of the paper! Not sure why, I guess I just thought the textured side should be the right side :)"
2,Crumpled Paper Is Worthless,"Upon receipt of my paper I knew immediately that something was wrong. The package was no longer a nice rectangular form but, an ugly ovular shape with what looked like tire marks across it. Sure enough, the paper was almost completely folded in half... worthless (especially at over a dollar a sheet). For improper packaging (to reduce the chances of such a situation) I give one star. For customer service and quickly working to refund my money I rate two stars.This is not the place to buy paper."
3,Interesting recording of Pugni's Ballet Esmeralda,"It is very difficult to find out works by Pugni who was a very famous ballet musician at the Imperial Russian Ballet. The grand pas de deux of Esmeralda is very well known for people devoted to ballet. This musical fragment is not included in the present suite of Esmeralda Ballet. The performing is no so bright as expected, being one of the most interisting moments the organ solo.Personally, I hope that a new recording of this ballet will be taken in a full length version."
4,More Please!,"Interesting score, not the best but some good music. There are so many wonderful ballet scores but Pugni, Drigo and Minkus...if only someone would have the vision to recored the best of these ""lost"" ballets!"
3,Not as good as some of her other ablums,"Released in 1990, this is Sara Hickman's second album. It is 55 minutes long and the sound quality is pretty good, especially for a CD released in 1990.I don't think that this is as good as her first album, Equal Scary People.On this album, she veers away from the Austin-style country tinged music and tries a bunch of different styles. She tries a jazz flavored number and a popish number and neither of them come off very well. I find some of the songs fairly bland, like Claim on My Heart. I'm not a huge country fan, and I like to see artists branch out and try new stuff. It is just that some people are good at some things and some people are good at others.But there are some great songs on this album, like Aurora, Too Fast and Take it Like a Man. I think that these songs are better than anything on Equal Scary People. I just don't think that the rest of the songs provide good support."
3,"Not her best Effort, but enjoyable","Best Tracks: Too Fast, Take It Like A Man, I Couldn't Help MyselfI found Shortstop to be missing something (what I can't say), and a little preachy.I'm a huge Sara Hickman fan, and this album certainly didn't turn me away from her music, but I found it lacking the uniqueness of her other releases.Although, there are a number of songs that shine forth, and this album is worthy of a listen."
2,Somewhat dissapointed,"After the rave reviews of this CD, I decided to take a chance and buy it. I was somewhat dissapointed as I don't think it's all that it was purported to be. I guess if others have felt the same, they didn't bother to write a review; only those that really loved the album."
4,great camera,This is the first camera I have purchased and I am glad i did it takes great pictures and good videos but you cant zoom in too far on the videos or it gets blurry. But overall it is a nice compact camera at an awesome price.
4,Very Good Product,"I purchased this product from Amazon and am totally satisfied with it. It does everything, a keyboard should do without any difficulties. I recommend not only buying this product, but buy it through Amazon.com. It will save you money!"
1,dyna not-so direct.com,"It's been over a week since it should have shipped, and it hasn't shipped yet... and they won't refund my shipping charge.Amazon should watch it's vendors a little closer."
2,If you don't like poetry you won't like this book!,"A wonderful story ruined by the author's constant attempts to come up with original and oh-so-clever descriptions (which in my opinion is the case with many poems). A few such sentences sprinkled throughout the book could have been tolerated, but practically every paragraph was just too much."
4,Intoxicating,"Other reviewers have commented on the plot. I will focus on but one aspect of the novel - the intoxicating language. Nolan makes words sing. His descriptions are arresting, his figures of speech spellbinding, and his attention to sound value utterly astounding. If adventurous language choices delight you, read this book and then spread the word. Nolan's novel deserves far more attention than it has received."
5,Works great on a PowerMac G5,"This card works as advertised on my Apple PowerMac G5 dual 2GHz (1st gen). I have quite an extensive collection of Firewire 800 devices for storage and this card fits the bill, giving me FireWire 800 speeds for my drives without daisy-chaning those devices. I do quite a bit of photo editing, and with the speed, I can edit and import photos at great speed."
2,"The analysis is fine, but the coverage isn't.","Mr Lalic has nicely analysed lots of games starting with 1. d4 Nf6, 2. c4 e6, 3. Nc3 Bb4, 4. Qc2. Unfortunately, too few of the games continue 4. ... c5, (a mere eleven and a half pages worth). He has seriously underestimated the importance of this line. Sokolov's book on the Classical Nimzo-Indian, though a little dated now, is more balanced and provides more illuminating explanations. Besides, Sokolov is a real expert on this opening..."
4,"Hmmm, I rather liked it","While I believe the review by corporateprogrammer below was right on, my criteria for judging a useful book is rather different than his in that if I find a single chapter of unique use in a book I will often buy it and find it useful. My time is worth more than the price of this book and it definately saved me several hours of working some things out for myself.While I would never recommend this as a first book about SOAP, I found Chapter 8 very useful and also enjoyed Chapters 4, 5, 12, and 13. In my judgement Chapter 8 (SOAP over JMS and SOAP over Javaspaces) alone justified the purchase.My judgement is that this book belongs on the bookshelf of every programmer who aspires to become a Web Services expert."
2,Technology Review Only - Little Practical Information,"This book does not really explain HOW to develop SOAP applications. Instead, it just spends page after page describing all the different technologies competing in the SOAP and web services arena. Upon completing reading this book, I had a much better understanding of what was happening in the chaotic development of SOAP, but I would not be able to develop anything using SOAP. This seems to be typical of this author's other books. I've read three of Brogden's books and they all tend to get bogged down in specification versions, generic overviews of APIs, and other occassionally interesting but not usually very useful informaiton. Then he doesn't take the time to carefully explain HOW to use the technologies in a practical way. This will be my last Brogden book."
4,Gooooood!!!!!!!!!,"I have read this book at school and I waspositivlysurprised. It deals with the social and racial problems ofstudents in the background of a love-story of the main characters,called Ruthie, Erika and AJ. It's a love triangle with a happy ending,of course. The wohole book is writen in a slang for a realisticfeeling and it's not difficult to read. You can't stop to read untilthe end."
4,book review,"The book Coming of Age is mainly a good book. The story takes place in a Town called Denver! It describes problems between races and an other subject is hopeless love! It's an interesting book to read for teenagers of the age of 16 and older ! All in all a lot of slang, and on a Scale out of 10 I would rate it 8."
5,If you want to make a movie this is the book to read!!!!!,"This book is the only coach you'll need to make it in the industry. Dov Simens straight-forward style really tells it like it is, concise and direct you won't question a single word. What I read in 2 hours, I had to learn the hard way in 2 years. Save yourself some time and gain a real step-by-step plan to make your movie."
3,It's Just Okay,"If you know absolutely nothing about film-making than this book could be helpful. If you have some understanding of writing, pre, prod and/or post than it's moderately helpful in filling in the blanks. Mostly it's just little tidbits here and there that might be helpful. Much of the list information is old and often out of date -- many production companies and/or producers are long gone. Its biggest asset is as a cheerleader -- anyone can make a film it insists. If you're collecting a ""film-making education"" library this won't hurt to have. If I were only getting one book -- I don't think this would be the one. I think you can learn a ton more by doing -- almost every city has something filming so intern for free and ""watch and learn."" Get a digital camera and some friends and shoot, edit etc. Once you've got an understanding of film mechanics (and a great script) then use the internet (and networking) to look for financing."
5,Excellent,I am 16 and have made several shorts that have won awards at film festivals. I read this book and have learned more from Mr Simens in 1 day of reading then my 2 years of high school film classes. Thank you Mr Simens for writing this excellent book and you will be the first one I thank when I make my Oscar speech.
5,From Reel to Deal: Everything You Need to Create a Successful Independent Film,"This book simply can't be touched... Nothing even comes close to the quality and quantity of information that is openly divulged in this manuscript. Best bang for the buck... ever!For anyone who decides to take the plunge and shoot their own independent film, this is a MUST READ.[...]"
3,Missing some info,"I've wanted to take one of Dov's workshops but they're never close to where I live so I bought this book which I like. However, with a copyright of 2005 I would have thought it would have more web information (urls, etc) in it. I suspect most of the information was compiled before the web got popular which has been a while. Oh well. I emailed Dov last year too and nobody bothered to reply. Still, for the price, very good info."
4,A must read for anyone thinking of getting into filmmaking.,Dov puts it all together as he shows step by step how to put a film together from conception to showcase.
3,easy read,"This book is an easy read and is informative but it didn't wow me. Having said that, if you are moving towards or are currently in the arts field it may be of some value to you."
2,THIS is supposed to be a Regency Historical? You're kidding!,"This reads more like a contemporary than a historical novel, with the characters all speaking and acting as if they walked in a modern city, not 1813 England. It was blatant, not something that was only occasional in the text, and I find it stunning and more than a little disappointing that an editor would read and approve of publishing a book that so badly misrepresents the Regency period. It wasn't even a good read because the very incongruity of the modern actions of the characters with the historical period was constantly distracting. It's writing like this that will end up ruining the Regency subgenre."
2,What a disappointment!,"I have read every one of A. Kane's books since her debut book, Dream Castle. The last 4-5 books have all been a let down. Within 100 pages the main characters express/acknowledge their love for each other and spend rest of the 355 pages solving a long drawn mystery. There is no intensity, doubt or mystery in their romance and I was very disappointed. Within the first 1/4 of the book the couple make their feelings obvious and join forces to fight some other problem. What is left in a romance novel to read after that? The mystery and the lovers search to solve the puzzle was all so boring. Everything in the romance was so rosy, too rosy almost all through the book."
3,"Borrow it from the library, but don't buy it!","The story plot was O.K., but I agree with the readers that said there were too many inaccuracies. The vocabulary was modern and the societal rules were not accurate. Stacie's behavior at her coming-out-ball would have been considered scandalous. Also, society would not have accepted Stacie or Brenna after George was arrested. There was little suspense, and neither women seemed to really be in danger."
3,A good read but not the best,"A good read, but I liked some of her other works better. Actually my only complaint with this book was that you really didn't get to know Damen that well or how he felt about things and what made him tick. I will say I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel though. I'll read anything Andrea writes - she's had so many other great ones!"
2,Save your money.,"I am kicking myself for buying ""The Gold Coin"" and ""The Silver Coin"" at the same time. After forcing myself to get through the first awfully boring book I have no desire to read the second."
1,Wretchedly poor,"""Passion and intrigue to new heights""? Maybe, but the writing and research are the pits.Clearly Ms. Kane should stick to writing contemporary stories, for she has no gift or feeling for the past.This was my first book by her, and my last."
1,Disapointed,I own a 1982 Corvette and was looking for a book that would help me conduct maintenance on it. This is not the book to own.Unfortunately I purchase a number of these types of general maintenance books to help me with my corvette. They do provide you with the most common repair processes for the most common Corvette but if your maintenance requirements for your Corvette are not common this book is useless. Unfortunately the (C3 body style) Corvettes underwent a lot of changes and unless you are really in luck procedures to repair your Corvette may not be correct in this manual.You need to purchase a Shop Manual for the year of car you own. They are available from different sources a lot from Amazon.Do not purchase these types of general maintenance books if you want to do anything other than change the oil.Unfortunately I did not figure this out until I connected with C3VR.com guys and got some help.
2,Double Check This Against Another Reference,"I spent many hours looking for parts with the correct casting numbers using this book only to find out the numbers were not even close. Look for for the most common exhaust manifold,#3932461 in the exhaust section. Did you find it? I could not. The book is well made and I will keep it, however I will always double check with another reference."
3,You Were Never Lovelier,"I love Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers, but I have seen better movies of these two. It was OK. I was disappointed."
2,"Don't be fooled -- it's a pamphlet, not a book!","At $7, this is a rip. For just $5 more, you can get the excellentFrenchmen, Desire, Good Children: And Other Streets of New Orleansthat will tell you the story of the city and its nomenclature since the Choctaws were first annoyed by the French. I am terribly disappointed in this purchase and will likely return it. Anyone who knows the city will see this slim offering as a tourist bauble."
5,High Praise for High Wire,I bought this CD just because the artist and I share the same last name. Little did I know I would chose one of my most listened to CDs. Listening to the enchanting voice of Sunny Wilkinson is sheer delight. She deserves to have a much higher profile in the jazz world. Every jazz lover should own this CD.
3,Good Overview,"This book gives a brief overview of all of the books of the Bible, essentially giving the reader a brief summation/outline of what each book is about. I can't remember if I got it free or if I paid ninety-nine cents for it. But at that price it was a little hard to pass up, and I would recommend this book to anyone as a basic reference/brief summation on helping them to grasp what each is trying to convey. Definitely worth reading, and the only reason I gave it 3 *'s is because of the brevity of it's content, but definitely 5*'s for the price."
4,"Not their best, but very good","Guadalcanal Diary' fourth and final record is not their best, I'd go with 2x4 for that. Still, a solid album of jangly Southern college alt. rock that will please fans of early REM. Going from the harder edge of Likes of You to the jangle-pop of Always Saturday this has been a favorite of mine since it's release. Murray Attaway is a gifted wordsmith and I would also recommend his often overlooked solo album In Thrall."
5,A great follow-up to 2x4!,"This is a great album that shows Guadalcanal Diary was continuing to grow as a unit. Drummer John Poe wrote some of the better songs on this disc that rocks just as hard as any of their earlier stuff. I've never understood why ""Always Saturday"" was never a big hit. Check out Barometer and Fade Out as typical GD - excellant lyrics and cool guitar licks. Pick up this CD along with 2x4 and you will be happily re-rocking the '80s."
5,RAM that Works,"Installed and functioned just fine. Great price for name brand memory, and boosting my system RAM to 2GB has improved performance. Would purchase Kingston memory again."
1,don't work in my pc,infortunately I wrog my purchase. It don't work in my pc and now they stay in Brazil.
1,No different than a piece of felt,"A poor example of what a grill mat should be. Save your money and buy a rubbermaid grill mat for even cheaper and of much higher quality. This so-called mat looks like a rolled up piece of felt you would find in a fabric store.Poor quality, high cost, no value..."
2,unsatisfied,the flat iron keeps shutting off all the time so it takes a really long time to do my hair :(
5,works great,"I really like this flat iron. It gets really hot, and the controls are on the inside which make it so you can't accidentally turn it off during use. The controls do not get hot. I used this to do a Japanese thermal on my hair, with the One n Only thermal straightener kit. Came out perfect. I also use it on my daughters curly hair. We are African, native American and caucasion heritage. Thick curly mixed texture hair. I only have to go over her hair once or twice. This is a great flat iron for the price. Highly recommended."
5,good iron,"hi my hair is lonnng and its so hard to style...specially when i take a shower and let my hair dry my hair is oh so awful :( And one time i slept over my bestfriends house (jenny) and after i let my hair dry from taking a shower me and her started talking and so we were bored and shes like ima starighten out ur hair to see how u look...i toldd her dont even try it will take u tooo long and uhh its going to look hoorible...after like 20 min no later she was done with my hair it was sooo shiny a i was impressed and i just couldnt believe it....she told me she ordered it from ""amazon"" and guess what i just did!! order it myself... i cant wait to recieve it in the mail im sooo excited!!!:D"
1,Sucks!,I'm really on the fence about this product. It came within a few days but it just came in a regular old brown box...so I believe it's a total knock off. The first week it worked great after I don't no wtf happen. Long story short I ended up buying another CHI.
5,My wife is ecstatic!,"Great flat iron. It has good size plates and works wonderfully. I gave it to my wife on Christmas and she immediately opened and ran to the bathroom to try. She loved it, and I got a lot of points for a great gift!"
2,Aweful!,"i have thick italian curly hair, and i bought the 2"" iron. it worked well for the first few months then i noticed it would just make my hair frazzled and poofy. plus i notcied that the gold plating is scraping off! i wasnt sure if it being off would damage my hair or not, so i tossed it and bought a solia. this product is good if you like wasting money on a straightener that will crap out in a year, if not, trash it!"
4,Compared to the CHI....,I bought the Chi 1' flat iron and compared to this one and I got very very similar results. Pretty good iron... The CHI I compared it to was the $129 one that they sell at Bed bath and beyond.
5,BEST CONSIDERING PRICE!,"I bought this from the local Sally Beauty Supply store because I just thought it looked like my hair stylist's straightener and I needed a new one. It works sooo well!! My hair is thick and kinda frizzy, but this straightener makes my hair look smooth and soft. The temperature can go up really high, but I only use it up to 350 degrees. I think it works just as well as my sister's which is one of those $100+ straighteners that you buy at the mall! So definitely work the 30-some dollars."
2,purchase at your own risk,"I had this product for a while, and i can't use it anymore because the ""ceramic"" gold plating is fading off. This flat iron serves the purpose of straightening your hair, but after using my friend's FHI ceramic flat iron, my hair looked like I came from the salon. It would be better to save up your money and buy a REAL ceramic flat iron..which is what I'm doing now."
5,Love it!,"I have very curly hair and I use this after blowdrying my hair and it leaves my hair STRAIGHT. No curls, no waves, not even frizzy (which is unusual lol). As long as you keep the plates clean the straightener lasts very long. I have had this straightener since last year and it still looks brand new. I definitely recommend this item for women with ethnic hair or even ""hard to handle"" hair."
2,Not the best flat iron!,"This flat iron leaves my hair dry and dull looking. I would not order again, shop around first. The size of the plates are large however it doesn't do a good job on my black thick relaxed hair. I would not recommend."
5,GREAT BUY!,IM IN LOVE WITH THESE FLAT IRONS. I use them everyday... came on time through the mail had no problems with them at all Thanks!
4,Great!!,"A great straightner. My only problem is that after a little while my hair begins to get a little wavy again, but overall its great. Heats up fast and my hair feels SUPER SILKY AND SMOOTH after use. The feeling is actually pretty amazing and my hair looks really nice as well."
3,ceramic iron,I think the irons are good but they dont seem like they will last real long. If you want a good ceramic then go with the real chia irons. You pay for what you get.
4,Concept album by Das Ich.,Basicly this is cabaret-industrial music from Germany. Das Ich are definitly Goth types...they use electronic instruments and are alltogether pretty creepy. This is one of those albums that fans either love or hate. I don't think it's five star qaulity...but it's pretty darn close. The artwork and sound effects are both awesome...and there are at least three songs on this album that will ring your bell. Crazy music....great for Halloween parties. >:)
1,"oh my god, is this a joke?","unbelievable. goofy vocals, goofier synths and retarded song writing are the mark of this beast which from reading reviews i was somehow expecting something a little more... good? like old front 242 or wumpscut... just GOOD dark electronic music, this was a bad joke and as much as i wanted to laugh i just couldn't. i am very open minded but this is for only the most geeky tasteless german electro nerds. maybe the old das ich is better but that's a little hard to imagine honestly"
5,A Must for Bond Fans,"I've always been a fan of Modern Marvels and this DVD contains two episodes devoted to the gadgets of the world's greatest spy - Bond, James Bond. As a bonus there is a biography of Ian Fleming which does a great job of giving the viewer some insights into the mind that created Bond.If you are a fan of James Bond, this is a must have as an addition to your collection of movies and memorobilia. Highly recommended."
3,I thought the voice from the elementary school science films would have retired by now...,"The gadgets from the Bond films are exciting and this disc is not. Don't get me wrong ~ this disc has a lot of background and little known facts about the gadgets and Bond himself. The tidbits behind the gadgets are really interesting but the monotone presenter doesn't convey this. If you want to know more about the cool gadgets in the 007 arsenal, this is a must have. If you want to be entertained like the movies, watch the movies instead."
4,See the science behind the gadgets,"If your a James Bond fan, or just a gadget fan this DVD is a must watch. It gets into the actual science behind some of the technology seen in the Bond films. Worthwhile."
3,Ships painting,"This is a nice kit. However I found the picture for the product looked more like an oil painting, but the product itself, the picture is more ""cartoon graphics"". Lots of tiny lines and details that need to be added after the printed parts are painted, makes this somewhat a tedious craft kit, and needs a patient hand and tiny brush. I like the picture, and the kit, but was slightly unhappy that some of the detailing and alike were not well presented in most sales listings for this item on various sites. I ended up giving it to my son to complete as my hands are no longer steady for those tiny lines."
2,Ugh,"This paint by number is one of the most annoying that I've bought. It requires color mixing (which a lot of paint by numbers do), but it is not intuitive at all. The numbers on the ""canvas"" are in a handwritten type font, and are almost impossible to read. There's no guide like most paint by numbers have, just a reproduction of the ""canvas"" on the packaging. The paint pots are difficult to open, and don't appear to have much product in them. There are some spots on the canvas that are just completely blank, with no way to tell what color they should be. In the smaller spaces an arrow is used to indicate color, but if you paint the larger areas first (as recommended) you'll cover them up. And lastly, in order to achieve the look on the packaging, you'd need to do a lot of painting even after filling in every space. I'm not a fan of this paint by number at all."
2,Excessively Misleading Product Photo,"I ordered this paint by numbers because I was looking for a nautical themed picture that would be somewhat challenging and would not come out looking like a child's painting. I loved the look of the picture on the website but was quite disappointed when the product arrived. Although I realize that one must use various techniques to achieve the look of the picture shown on the site, a child's art project is exactly what this item looks like. I have not even started working on the painting yet because to get colors similar to those shown on the site, I am going to have to purchase all new paints.Perhaps a picture of the packaging from the painting rather than a finished product would show more clearly what one is dealing with if they order this item. The only reason that I am not returning this is the fact that the price was considerably better that what I have seen in stores for comparable items."
4,review of Magical Moments for Mum,"This is a very good compilation of oldies music, don't be put off by the rather corny title given to this 2 Cd set. Being from Sony BMG, it is well presented, and all tracks are original versions.You can buy with confidence. Cheers, Peter."
5,Mortal Sins,"Penelope Williamson spins a lush story, complete with sharply drawn characters and a plot within a plot. As a native of Louisiana, I found little to fault with Williamson's portrayal of culture and race relations. Read every word and rushed out and bought the sequel, The Wages Of Sin (which I thought was even better). Crack for the thriller fan."
4,Reads like a movie script.,"We follow Daman Rourke, a homicide cop, as he investigates a murder in New Orleans in 1927. But this murder is very personal for him, since he knew the deceased, the deceased's wife (who used to be the love of his life), and all the other peripheral characters involved. Ms. Williamson ties the many characters together in an easy to follow manner and I was kept guessing to the end as to who the murderer was. However, about halfway through the book I almost considered putting it down, it just dragged on and on and really reads like a 1940's B gangster movie. I would recommend this book because the ending should surprise you (with a few loose ends left dragging) but wait for the paperback."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"I loved this book. Lush, evocative prose and an extraordinary cast of characters grab the reader from the first page and don't let go until the last. Relationships twine and untwine and intertwine in a way that could have been confusing but instead captivates by keeping you guessing. This is such a departure from the romance and women's fiction of Penelope Williamson that some fans may be disappointed. But the new pen name allows a fresh voice and a new approach that this fan applauds. Well done!"
4,Mortal Sins,I like how Penelope Williamson gives her characters heart.It is descriptive but the story does not drag. I would recommend it.
1,"Oh, please.","""Mortal Sins"" is intolerably bad writing. Williamson heaps cliche upon cliche, and the result is a predictable bore of a novel."
1,"Beautiful Background, Boring People","The star for this book is really for New Orleans. If the author wrote more about the city then the people who lived there, the book would have garnered more stars. Boring, self absorbed people do not an interesting book make. Damon Rourke, the lead character while having some redeeming qualities, also appears to be just a lttle nuts. While very busy seeming to care about everyone in his town, he seems to have very lttle emotion left for his young daughter. Remie Lelourie, his former lover, and leading suspect in her husband's death, is quite insane. Yet we are supposed to find these very unappealing characters, romantic star crossed lovers. I have read some reviews here that indicate Penn Williamson is a pseudonym for a romance writer. Well it shows in the plotting and prose of this book.After reading about these characters, whom I had no desire to meet, greet or even pass by on the street, my whole reaction was who cares."
5,great,Dr Harold Shank is one of the wisest men on the planet. He is easily the best professor i've had-hands down. much can be learned from the book and if you have an opportunity to take any of his classes you should do so.
2,"Cute, but size was all wrong.","We even measured our dogs against the dimensions provided for this product. We've got a small boston terrier and this didn't end up fitting him. We should have ordered a medium. The quality was there, but size was off."
3,Who wouldn't want a book recommended by Friederich the Great,The preliminary discourses are a surprisingly entertaining description of D'Alembert's ideas about knowledge and learning. This introduction to the great Encyclopedia of Diderot is an important work of the Enlightenment in itself.
1,Listen to What You Write!,A philologist should be able to write good English. This book is written in such a bad style that it hurt my ear. This man should not write about music as long as his style is so unmusical.
1,I should have listened to the earlier reviewer.,"I thought that the person that reviewed the straightening comb was being tough but this comb is the worst. It's far too bulky to be functional, it pulled out my hair. I thought I'd be able to use it between relaxers but it was really a waste of money."
3,"Not the greatest, but functional","I have not had natural hair for more than 20 years. And I never learned to press hair. I purchased this comb for safety reasons -- to keep me from burning out my hair! I also thought the adjustable teeth would be good for a novice presser.After a few uses, I can't manage to get my ends as straight as the roots. This may be my fault. I guess this is great if you have a relaxer. The teeth aren't fine enough, even when you adjust them.The comb is very light, which may attribute to this as well. What works best for me is following up with a curling or flat iron to completely straighten.I haven't experienced it pulling out my hair, at least no more than a normal appliance.I wouldn't trade this for a traditional pressing comb, but I'm not enthusiastic about recommending it to anyone else."
1,Garbage!,"I purchased this to straighten my daughter's hair. It barely gets hot enough to straighten soft fine hair, and it is difficult to get straight hair because adjustable design and bulkiness prevents the comb from getting close to the hair. Poorly designed product. Terrible for straightening ends of hair."
1,Ineffective and unsafe (cord contains lead),"The comb attachment has 3 adjustable set of teeth.I couldn't figure out what the adjustments were meant to achieve, except make the product bulky. Hard to get to hair roots. Also there's a tag on the cord that indicates that it contained lead! It advises to wash your hands after handling. Needless to say I got rid of it right away!!"
1,Extremely Disappointed and Not Satisfied,"I really was disappointed with this product. It did not do what it claims to do, it was very hard to figure out and never got hot enough to straighten my hair. A normal flat iron works a heck of alot better then this comb which I would of thought it would of been less time to do and quicker to straighten. Very Very disappointed"
3,Straigtening comb different than more conventional oness,I have mixed feelings regarding this ceramic adjustable straigtening comb. Maybe I am just unfamiliar with it but I had a later model of the gold and hot series and felt more comfortable in using it. To me it seems not to run smoothing through my hair but almost pulling at it. I don't think I will purchase another one. Like I said maybe it is just me. I felt very uncomfortable in using it.
2,bulky and snags,"The design of the comb is awkward. Though the idea is good in theory, the fact that the comb adjusts is actually a negative feature and not the positive that you would think it would be. It snags and pulls out more strands of hair as a result. Because I was pleased with other products by this company, I was eager to try this one, but I have been left disappointed. It is less than mediocre."
2,HOT straightening comb,The comb is VERY HOT as you attempt to comb your hair. I don't recommend it at all.
2,Ceramic Straightening Comb,This type of straightening comb just doesn't do it for me like the old fashion straightening comb. I understand that the ceramic straightening comb is better on your hair but it just doesn't get the job done like the old fashion straightening comb.
1,Communist Propaganda in Disguise,"I agree one hundred percent with MamboCha's review. This book is another example of communist propaganda finesse.The Cuba then, wasn't the Cuba I left in 1961, and the Cuba now does not portray the destruction and misery the Castro brothers and their puppety government have inflicted in what used to be the most prosperous, educated, and beautiful country in the Caribbean.My advise to the reader: Please be very careful when choosing books about Cuba, especially those dealing with the history of that country. Shame, shame, shame.Andrew J. RodriguezAward-winning author: ""Adios, Havana,"" a MemoirPS: To view pictures of the Cuba that was, I recommend the book ""Havana Before Castro""by Peter Moruzzi."
3,BITTERSWEET,"THIS IS AN INTERESTING BOOK TO SAY THE LEAST. I HAVE SEEN MANY OTHER PICTURES OF THE PRE CASTRO TIMES AND THEY ARE BY FAR MUCH MORE ELGANT AND BOAST A MUCH MORE PROSPEROUS PRE CASTRO TIME. IT IS NOT FAIR TO USE SUCH ANTIQUATED PICTURES TO FURTHER USE WHAT THE CASTRO GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN THEM TO COVER A SOCIAL AND POLITIAL DISASTER.STILL, NO ONE SAID IT HAD TO BE THE YESTERDAY PICTURES FROM A SPECIFIC TIME SO ALL IN ALL IT IS AN INTERESTING BOOK AND I WOULD NOT CALL IT BAD BECAUSE EVEN DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THESE BEFORE PICTURES WERE TAKEN STILL SHOWS CUBAN ARCHITECTURE."
5,Terrific post-war romance set in England,"This romance novel begins with a twist (won't give it away) and keeps the reader interested until the end as the heroine faces her past. It's set in post-war England and while not a ""bodice-ripper"" it still is infused with enough relationship ups and downs to maintain a good storyline."
4,"Takes time, but it works","Just to prove the product works, I am dictating with version 1.6.6 right now. It is about 90 percent accurate for me. I have few complaints except the documentation, and the long list of things you can say often goes back to the beginning when you're further down the list. All in all though, I am happy with the product and I have saved a lot of hand use. It is virtually the only program of its kind for the Mac - you can dictate into any program in which you can type. You might want to consider buying the version without the microphone and purchasing the higher end microphone MacSpeech offers. You cannot go very fast, and you have to say things exactly like it requires, but if you have rsi like I do, it sure helps."
1,Program won't launch,"Worst software that I have ever purchased! I've re-installed and it still quits 1 second after it launches. I have iListen 1.7 on an Intel based iMac running OS 10.4.7. Even worse is MacSpeech's web site has been down for several days and telephone support is 15 bucks for 15 minutes (and they apparently call you back at their convenience). Maybe I just got a bad copy, but it's hard to tell when you can't even get any customer support."
4,All the Biblical Criticism Stuff You Could Ever Define,"This handbook is a good tool any student of Biblical criticism will want. It offers definitions, histories and other information concerning important figures and terms in Biblical criticism. Whether you want to look up B. H. Streeter or KJV or Heilsgeschichte or anything else related to Biblical criticism, you can find it in this book."
4,Useful but not all inclusive,"This is a very handy little book for anyone interested in biblical studies. It's set up in alphabetical order, from acrostic and advocacy criticism to Walther Zimmerli and zweiquellentheorie, the two source theory. Want to know what 'mashal' means in biblical studies? It's all right here, in an easy to use format. This is especially useful for people who may not be familiar with German terms, for biblical scholarship for centuries has been dominated by German scholars. So if you come across ""religionsgeschichtliche schule"" it's a mention of the old History of religions theory.One small caveat: it doesn't include the most modern scholarship."
4,book club read,"I am thinking of choosing either this book or The Secret for our book club, which is comprised of mostly black women near 40 years of age. I am leaning toward this book because, although it is a light read, it will allow people to discuss issues like interracial romance, workplace challenges, family dynamics, racism, and the best places to travel.I enjoyed this book. I think that it is reminiscent of a lot of Benilde Little's work. The only small thing that bothered me is that the book could have used some editing in places (early in the first chapter the author mentions the main character driving to the airport in a BMW and then all of the sudden she is magically in a Mercedes). It is a small thing, but don't people read these things before they are printed? I guess that you can tell I am an English teacher. This is a fun book, however, and I think that you should read it."
4,"The Original Eat, Pray, Love!!","I just re-read Passport Diaries, and it felt fresh and new. This was such a great story of independence and self-exploration, and of course travel. It's the original Eat,Pray,Love...sista-style! I re-enjoyed this novel, and am passing it on for a good friend to read."
2,Funny but so wrong,"The book was entertaining. Lots of comedic value. However, I often had the urge to wash the main character's mouth out with soap. It helps if you read this book without taking too seriously the stereotype the black female character resembles. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if I could. But I can't."
3,Fun SUMMER read,"This is a fast summer girly read. No life lessons here to learn or sappy moment BUT it is fast and it gives you a break from reality. No one dies, or has a life altering disease, no sad stories here. Plenty of laugh out loud moments. The story is about an attorny that was just suspended and about to celebrate her 35th birthday all while going through a break up from her BOOTY CALL... So she sets off to Europe for 6 sixs. All in all she meets some fascinating people and some interesting experiences that allows her not to take life so seriously! I loved the ending because sometimes the girly girl in me puts down the jaded books and I need to break from reality and have things neatly tie out and life goes on HAPPILY EVER AFTER. It was cute, it was fun, and if you guys want to kills a few hours and just break from the norm and have a little bit of romance in a book then this is a good read."
2,Erica Jong without all the messy literary allusions?,"Erica Jong without all the messy literary allusions?""... as she tenderly affixed his cufflinks in the mornings before work."" I know why the publishers chose this scene for their marketing blurb. It was clearly the best written scene in this entire book.After that, the little history lesson on King George III and Charlotte, and the heroine Kia's astute observations on her good fortune in being raised in middle-class America, I was DONE with this book. Can I stand another shallow ""gurlfriend"" character? Can I stand anymore superficial references to God from African Americans (in books, media, entertainment, etc.) who have not displayed anything in their actual lifestyles to indicate any importance placed on God?Perhaps Ms. Gregory's film background hasn't as yet afforded her the mettle to develop characters with more depth.If you are a reader who cares about being challenged and surprised by an author, this book is NOT recommended."
5,Best prog metal out there...,"I really enjoy this title; much more than Iconoclast or V:The New Mythology Suite. If you like Symphony X's ""Paradise Lost"" you'll like this one too. I'd love to see these guys do an instrumental album! Not to dis on the singer--he's good--but man these guys are talented!"
4,Symphony X - The Odyssey,"""The Odyssey"" (2002) is the sixth album by progressive metal band Symphony X. It has an epic, symphonic feel, and features a 24-minute track based on Homer's ""The Odyssey"".Michael Romeo's guitar is fantastic as always, and Russell Allen shows an outstanding vocal range. With a running time of over an hour, ""The Odyssey"" has enough variety to keep the listener's interest, even if it is a little inconsistent overall.All told, this is a solid progressive metal album from one of the best prog metal bands out there."
5,Excellent,"This is my first symphony x album it seems like this is the only album of them they they have on the CD shelves. What I did not like about this album though is that the keyboarders excellent and it seems like they did not give him enough chances to shine. The opening track wich is Inferno is a great opening for the cd and immediately invites you to listen to more. It does not change from there, but my favorite track on the CD is King Of Terrors. Once you hit track number eight The Odyssey you hear a great 24 minute track. This CD is worth every penny you spend on it and after you buy this CD you want to see what else symphony x has out. Two Thumbs Up"
5,Relaxing Piano Music!,"After hearing this CD play in a gift shop, I ordered a copy for myself. It is most beautiful and I find myself letting the entire CD repeat and repeat!!"
4,memory stick,"Kingston 512MB DDR400 32MX64 C3 KIT OF2 ( KVR400X64C3AK2/512 ) Works well on my Dell 4550 Dimension. I thought I was buying two sticks of 512 like it says 'kit of two', for a total of 1024MB. Not the case. It's a total of 512MB. Another site I found does explain its 512 MB total."
5,Beautiful looking and works great,"Amazon was the lowest price I found on the web to buy a replacement lever for one sent to us by our lumber company. They couldn't supply the correct one for weeks so I purchased it here instead, for nearly the same price they offered. It looks great and works great. The other Schlage, the oil-rubbed-bronze lever, apparently rubs off easily leaving you with something other than oil rubbed bronze. This one, per the lumber company we went through, does not do that. We haven't had these long enough to know for sure either way."
5,Protein Power,"This will be my entire diet!!I am not done reading this book yet, but this plan is so well documented and explained that it makes a LOT of sense. I am already lowering my colestrol by lowering my intake of 'carbs'. Harold"
4,For people who want to be healthier,It was very informative and I liked that it was written in both a detailed format and a get to the point format - so I didn't have to read the whole thing to find out what I wanted to know -
5,The best book of the many 'similar approaches',"I really enjoyed this book. I've read half a dozen others that discuss eating plans related to the 'low-carb' approach. This book is not a diet book. It's like having a couple of intelligent, research-oriented doctors with tons of experience sit down and explain things about nutrition and health to you in plain english. Each chapter addresses a slightly different topic, so that you are able to see how everything fits together, and why there is no one thing which, done in a vacuum or alone, is likely to be a good answer to better health. The Eades cover related areas that are very much needed, such as foods, drinks and drugs that work against low-carb eating plan weight-loss success (and why), and more. Reading other books, I felt like I'd read a good idea. Reading this book, I felt like I understood a whole facet of life on earth I hadn't before. And it was pretty enjoyable reading, as well. I highly recommend it."
3,"you want to lose fat not just weight, right?","You will definitly lose fat (you know the bad stuff not the good stuff), and you will do it in a way that is so easy and without any hunger pains, also it's safer than the Atkins diet. I now look great and feel even better.Actually all the important stuff could have taken up less than two pages, but that certainly wouldn't sell a book and the publisher wouldn't be happy with a two page book. Most of the book is facts used to convince use this is the right diet. I'm here to convince you, this is the right book."
5,It works!,I am 61 and was 25lbs overweight with a blood sugar problem. I decided to try this pgm because I thought that it was safer than the Atkins diet. This pgm really works! I lost 12lbs in 4 weeks and 16 in 8 weeks. I cheated a little along the way or I would have done even better. My chloesteral went down 40 points and my blood pressure is now 120/62. Clothes that I hadn't worn in 3 years now fit fine. The book is well-written with chapter summaries that you can read rather than the entire text. I would put the tables either in the front or back as an appendix though. We bought the hardback because we refer to it often. I am truly thankful that I found this pgm. The truth is what you need and what you get. A safe and sensible way to diet for life.
2,Here's to the Upside Down Pyramid,"This is a wonderful book. Very complicated in some ways, but well worth the effort. I have lost 30 pounds and kept it off easily My son has lost fifty. We both feel great, our blood fat way down and our doctors are delighted!To Hell with the ""food establishment"""
4,Almost convinced,Solid arguments won me over from a very skeptical beginning position as a Zone follower to being almost convinced that the authors have improved upon what Barry Sears began. Since they state that it looks to them as if pre-agricultural man ate 65% animal and 35% plant I am going to buy the book and read over again.
1,great piece of FICTION,"The book definatly follows the stereotypical portrayal of Tecumseh, but does not follow history. If you want an inspiring story about the greatest ""noble savage"" then its fine, but if you want to know what really happened I wouldn't reccomend the play or the book.If you want historical facts check out:The Shawnee Prophet (Bison Book)orThe Shawnees and the War for America: The Penguin Library of American Indian History series (Penguin Library of American Indian History)"
5,Fantastic Variety of Honey,"There is only one word to describe this product and that is Fantastic. It is raw honey which means it has not been heated or processed. It is complete as nature intended. I can't help wondering why people waste everyone's time writing ""reviews"" n based on the condition of the product due to damage by the shipper. That's NOT a characteristic or defect of the PRODUCT. That's a defect of the CARRIER and should be taken up in a review of the carrier."
2,Package was completely damaged,"I am sure it's a nice honey. But, I could not enjoy it because, the package found completely damaged when it was just arrived."
4,Very cute... great deal...,"It is very cute, the colors are great and it shipped quickly (and for free!). It is sturdy, and durable. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish you could use it for hot drinks also, and it is not dishwasher safe and the straw can be a pain to clean. It is a great deal for the price though."
5,Very Satisfied,I received a high quality product for a fair price -- it also arrived early which was a bonus!!!
1,Bigger than what I wanted to carry always.,"I have this to compare with the Lyra AV side by side but this with all the accessories is just too heavy and bulky to carry. It is more expensive and cheaply made with all plastic materials. It doesnt look like the price it is asking. It is supposed to be a mobile entertainment device, but the size and the form makes its awkward to be mobile. If they can reduce the size and the weight and make it a little sexier than the Lyra, then it maybe worth considering.Some are raving about the camera accesory that attaches which makes it bulkier. What a joke. The resolution is not even decent to be serious."
1,Buy the RCA Lyra 2780 Audio/Video Instead!!!,"The Archos and the Lyra have very similar features, but the Lyra cost at least $100 less and is built with much better quality. I purchased both so I could compare side by side. I returned the Archos and haven't looked back. The Lyra doesn't have all features available at this time, but two firmware updates have been released less than 3 weeks apart, each enabling more and more features. The features available out of the box are adequate and the controls are easy to use and comfortable. The Archos is big and clumbsy and the battery life is worse."
4,"AV320 Good, but AV420 Great","When I first purchased my av320 a while back I thought it was a good product. The AV420 is leaps and bounds above the 320. First off the loading times for photos are much faster - almost twice so. The built in CF slot is also a nice feature. When viewing images on a standard television the quality is much better than the previous unit.Loading video is much faster as well, and playback is in true DVD resolution.and the following link is a great tool for getting your DVDs onto the AV420Music playback is great and the new smaller size of the unit makes it more portable.No matter how you get one of these multimedia players, I'm sure anyone looking for a top quality product of this nature will not be disappointed. Definitely consider the AV420 as well, the price difference may be worth it to you."
2,Mediocre At Best,"I recieved the AV320 as a Christmas gift this past December. As you can see, it is now June, not six months later. My system is very messed up and often will not turn on. If it does turn on, it shuts off when it feels necessary. Or, lines appear on the screen. I don't know anyone else with this, so I can't say whether or not it's a common problem, but I do know that I'm taking it back very soon to replace it, probably with a Panasonic SV-AS10D. I thought perhaps it was a power issue, but it has full battery. I can only owe this problem to something with the machine.However, I must admit that I like the HD screen very very much, and the sound quality is beautiful. I recorded a hardcore show one night, and upon playing it I felt like I was there again. It's a pity that it's so badly messed up."
4,The New Comprehensive A-Z Crossword Dictionary,"This is the second copy of this dictionary I have purchased, the first was total worn out with cover falling off and pages dogeared. This time I also purchased two additional copies as gifts and both parties found them very helpful. I would definitely recommend this dictionary if you are a crossword nut."
1,did not help me at all,"I wanted it to help me when I do crossword puzzles, and looking up words, I DID NOT FIND ONE SINGLE ANSWER TO WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!Personally, I would like to return it!"
5,THE ONLY CROSSWORD DICTIONARY FOR ME,The best crossword puzzle dictionary I have used in dozens of years working crossword puzzles. Easy to use and the coverage is more than adequate for two weekly puzzles I solve.
3,Good dictionary...lousy packaging,The dictionary is good. Has a lot of info in it that's helpful.The actual hard-copy is not good. I ordered this as another copy to own because the one I had was falling apart - several pages had already come lose and I had to have them folded in the book....I've only had this one a few weeks and there are already pages becoming loose! I'm not hard on books. This is ridiculous. Whoever publishes this book does really sloppy work. I know I'm not the only person who has this problem with this particular book. They need to get their act together...they owe a lot of people a better product.
4,Worth buying.,I should of studied more inhigh school. This book was a big help. I have bought this book before and was a big help to me. Lots of definitions.
5,For those getting started in crossword puzzles,"I bought Mrs. Schaffer's ""A-Z Crossword Dictionary"" and I think it is probably the most used dictionary in my collection. There is no ""one"" crossword dictionary that will solve all of the clues. In my collection I have: ""The New York Times Crossword Dictionary"", ""The Random House Crossword Dictionary"", and ""The Dell Crossword Dictionary"". To also assist you in solving many crossword puzzles I recommend the ""DVD & Video Guide 2004"", ""Proper Name Finder"", and a good world atlas."
3,Not as expected!,"New Comprehensive A-Z Crossword DictionaryI purchased this crossword dictionary to replace one that I've utilized for reference for many years. I based my decision on the descriptive attributes of being bigger and better than ever with thousands of updated entries, and containing nearly twice as much information as competing crossword dictionaries. However, I find this crossword dictionary lacking in much of the word definitions and descriptive information that my old crossword dictionary contains. I find that I must still resort to my old crossword dictionary when stumped by crossword clues because the answer could not be found in the A-Z Crossword Dictionary."
2,Crossword puzzle dictionary,This dictionary is not comprehensive as described in the title. It is difficult to use and not applicable in most cases. Would not recommend for the serious crossword puzzle solver.
2,New comprehensive A to Z crossword dictionary,"This dictionary is loaded with entries and words but as I have used it for solving puzzles, it does not seem to have the answeres I am looking for. There are no ""special sections"" in it such as authors, gods etc. I am disappointed in its value to me."
4,Excellent Reference book,"I gave this book as a gift to my mother. She is an avid cross word puzzle solver. She uses the same book, but it has seen better days. So I sent her this new one. It had about 30 pages cut short. The bottom 2 lines of print on these pages were cut off. It was to late to send it back. Now I probably will get one from town."
4,The New Comprehensive A-Z Crossword Dictionary,I was pleased to find this book on-line for such a good price. It saved alot of time and gas money trying to find one in low-cost book stores.
2,Buy the NY Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,This dictionary was suppose to be better than the NY Times. Not even close! There are far fewer solution words.
1,Useless,"I wanted a more up-to-date crossword puzzle dictionary. This crossword puzzle dictionary may be up-to-date, but I've found it to be virtually useless. I've totally given up on it and gone back to my old puzzle dictionary."
1,Wrong Purchase,I am very disappointed with this book. References are impossible to find or non existent. Try something else
5,Great tool for the crossword puzzle fan!,"I have really enjoyed this crossword puzzle dictionary. It is easy to look up words and clues and the information is pretty much up to date. I especially like the additional information in the appendices.....themes in crossword puzzles, common crossword answers, and best of all, LISTS! The lists are such things as: Presidents/Vice Presidents, Oscar/Emmy Information, MVP Players, Super Bowls, Popes, and on and on......If you enjoy crossword puzzles and don't mind having a little help now and then, then this is a great book to reach for!!"
5,crossword dictionary,"one of the best crossword dictionaries on the market, needed a new one, my old copy of the dictionary wore out"
4,Crossword Buffe,This is a nice dictionary and is very easy to read. It has most of the answers. It is nice to hold and look thru and easy to understand. I do recommend it.
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed. Have loved most of Anne Rule's books, but this on is definitely not up to her standards. Appeared to be put together just to make money"
2,Not as good as her earlier works...,I have to agree with the readers that have stated this is not as good as her earlier works. She seems to be losing her passion and style. This book is very disjointed in places and I don't care for the personal references she throws in from time to time. The story will be moving along somewhat smoothly then she out of nowhere interjects a personal statement. It really takes away from the narrative.Also don't like the ficticious names nor the recycling of old stories. Ms. Rule is a much better author than this book would ever show.
3,When a writer becomes to comfortable in their own skin,"Sorry but I feel the same...I love Ann Rule but, the last three books have been disappointing. The true case files came out as a new release, and was filled with old stories I'd read before. The Green River Running Red was hard to keep track of in the style that it was written. This story- Kiss Me Kill Me, was okay but, it was filled with old cases.Ann has maybe taken on a different theme in her writing style as some writers do after years of bestsellers. I'm writing this only to say don't forget about us Ann...your fans! We love you just the way you were! Please don't change!"
2,Audio cd review: Grisly without being suspenseful,"I really enjoyed Ann Rule's audio CD of the dentist accused of killing his wife, which I think was, ""Too late to say goodbye."" I had ordered it without reading the description, so I was on the edge of my seat most of the CD, there were lots of surprises I didn't anticipate, and there were some really interesting details about how the police proved their case. This audio CD was very disappointing by comparison. The stories are frequently disturbing without really having anything suspenseful happen, no big surprises in terms of investigation, etc. It's almost just like a chronicle of some of the more sensational cases she wrote about during a certain time period, but none of it gave me much insight or kept me on the edge of my seat.The Audio CD format was pretty similar to the other one I had listened to, namely, it involves a female professional reader who reads in a very dispassionate way, which I prefer."
5,Well Worth Reading,"I enjoyed this book immensely. It had everything, suspense, horror, and of course how the bad guys get caught. Definite reading for anyone. In general Ann Rule's books are very good. I much prefer the ones though that have several different stories in them as opposed to the ones that tell one story only. Again, Ann Rule never disappoints."
4,This is one of Ann Rule's best,"I have read several of Ann Rule's true crime novels, but I noticed the writing style of this one is better than the others. In Kiss Me Kill Me, Rule uses her skill as a former police officer to bring the forensic details to life, but she also delves into creating the relationships with the victims and their killers. The book makes it is easy to see how sociopathic killers can catch normal and intelligent women totally unaware. I really liked this one."
5,This is one of Ann's best,"This is a good book, It is as good as all of Ann's other books. I don't agree with the low reviews. And yes there is one repeated story but only one. And there is nothing wrong with reading a story more that once. Ann Rule is the best true crime writer & she always will be. If you like Ann you will like this book. It has 10 stories. One main one & the rest are short. I love these. They are stories that you can sit down & read the whole thing."
2,So disappointed,"I have read and loved all of Ann's books, even her Crime Files series. This one however was very disappointing. If feels as if it were thrown together just to get it on the market. Another thing was the fact that so many of the names were fake. I understand why that is necessary in certain instances but to give fake names to the killers is in my opinion demeaning to the victims. I like to do research on certain cases and it is very time consuming to research for the killer's real name first. If they have been tried and convicted then their real name should be used, even if they have done their time and have been released. IMHO"
2,Not Ann's Best Book by a Long Shot!,"I love Ann Rule, but this book does not showcase her talents. It is rather lifeless, dull, and far too easy to put down after a few pages. I just couldn't get interested in these musty old cases. I'm sure they were newsworthy in their day, but they make for boring reading in this volume. Read some of Ann's earlier works, they are much more rewarding than this one. Sorry, Ann."
3,Dissapointing and Confusing,"I too am a fan of Anne Rule, and grab up her Crime Files as soon as I see them on the bookstore shelves. But I have to say this volume was a bit dissapointing and confusing. The first story which the title comes from felt disjointed. It seemed to bounce from one killing to another and was missing her usual seemlessness. The transistion from Sandy to Ted Bundy by page 29 threw me off completely.All in all it wasn't a bad read, but certainly not to the same standard that I am sure all Ann Rule fans are familiar."
4,quality and price,"Product was received in a timely manner and as described by the seller. My Treo fit perfectly into the lambskin case, and the price was ""right"" compared to if I had purchased it at the local ""phone store"". Quality and price...that's right!! Thank you Amazon and Cellet."
2,Item is....,"Not the most durable I've seen or used. I've had the product for maybe a month, and the belt clip has already broken. After about 2 weeks, the wracheting switch broke apart, and just today as a matter of fact, the little tab that locks the phone in place busted, not allowing me to remove the phone from the clip.The concept is great, the leather case is holding nice, but the plastic seems to be no so great. I now have to run to Best Buy and see if I could get a new clip to work with this CELLET product..."
1,cellet belt clip holder for palm treo,"The fit is not good and the holder is always off center. Due to the poor fit, it turns off my ringer when I am carrying my phone on my belt. I will replace it and do not recommend it"
3,Better than expected,"Not sure if it's really leather. Suppose it's close enough, even if faux. Secure snap strap. Can't beat the price. Shipping was a bit expensive--considering the price of the item."
4,Terrific power-pop from Washington DC,"Anne Summers is not a woman. It is a band of three young gentlemen from Washington DC. They have crafted a catchy, hook-laden record that keeps you coming back for more. The boys in the band, Alec Boyajy (bass & vocals), Andrew Pontano (guitar & vocals) and Brad Samuels (drums), write songs about being young in the suburbs and partying like it ain't a problem. The Dandy, their first album on San Diego's PC Music label, is a great listen. They are currently in the studio working on their second album with Don Fleming producing. Remember the name Anne Summers, you will see it again."
2,Ok but matches go to fast,I am a owner of this game and i think it is the worst game i own. for one thing the matches are to fast all it takes is a couple hits and punches and there down. so if you want a game like this i recomend WWWF Raw or another fighting game.
4,Very realistic,"Great game. The graphics and gameplay are amazing. I would like to be able to adjust the damage so that multiplayer matches would last longer or to handicap better players, to make for more exciting matches. The control setup seems a little awkward in comparison to other fighting and wrestling games, but they're relatively simple, and can be mastered quickly. Overall this is an outstanding game."
2,LAAAAME.....,This game could be good. If they had a more variety of moves and a more variety of types of matches and arenas. It does'nt have some of the great people I though it would like Ken Shamrock and some others. But It lacks variety. I'd choose WWF Raw over this anyday. This game is straight up GARBAGE. The people who rate this game good obviously don't have good taste or they are just too big of UFC fans. Please for your own sake DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ever.
1,Very dissappointing,"I waited for this game to arrive with great anticipation and wow what a dissappointment, there is nothing that makes this game standout. The graphics are good but nothing special, the lack of being able to replay a fight without starting all over again totally sucks, especially when you are first learning. If you want a fighting game look elsewhere. I have owned the game for 2 days and will be immediately selling it."
1,dont even think about getting this game,"I have played this game, and their are two many things wrong with is. first their is no point to it, their is not enought action and the game is just boring"
2,Not Good At All,This game is bad! And not in a good way. I have not been overly impressed with any of the XBox titles to date. And this game is no exception. The create a character is a cool option. To bad all the ones you create will [stink]. I thought WWF Raw was bad. It is a master piece compared to this game. The graphics are great and that is about all that stands out with this game. The bottom line is this game is just not overly impressive. That's to bad. If the XBox doesn't get some great or even good games out quick it will not be around much longer. Save your money. This game stinks!
4,Enchanting...,"A Little Piece Of Sky, from the title to the text works. It is the story of Song Byrd from childhood to adulthood. It speaks of Song's tribulations and triumphs in a heartfelt connected way. The story poignantly expresses how the trajedy of our past can still haunt our present and hinder our futures if not for hope. Song's hope came from seeing her life without limits through, A Little Piece of Sky. My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 was because the book had to end. I really wanted more. The author's writing was so good and intriguing that I would have loved to have read this as a full blown novel with more details.I so look forward to this author's next piece of work."
5,Looks good,"Product is sturdy, looks good and displays the watches well. It is easy to open and close and put the watches in and take out. Nice accessory for the room and performs its functions well. If you like how it looks in the picture I wouldnt be worried about anything else."
5,Great,Very beautiful quality item. Get it at this price. The watches look great in very classy case. It's worth it.
5,Perfect holder,I like this holder.It is stylish & holds my watches secure.This is not to big & is just what I needed.
4,Black leather watch box,The watch box was a gift for someone else who says he's quite pleased with it. I'm happy about that.
4,Not for the small wristed,"The construction and look of the box is great. If you have a small wrist, it is likely that your watches wont clasp around the included pad inserts. My watches are big enough to span the gaps, but they do move around.... wouldn't stop me from buying."
5,House your watches in style!,"This is a stylish leather watch case, perfect to hold a small collection. It has nice sleek lines and a pretty glass cover - my husband loved it! It is well made and reasonably priced."
5,Beautiful Case,"Just started ""collecting"" watches about a year ago so this case for 6 was perfect for me. I was really impressed when it got it, it looks much more expensive than it was.One drawback, the slots that the watches seat into are just wide enough for a normal watch band. One of my watches is a Fossil with a thick leather band and it doesn't fit. Not a big deal for me but it might be for you.Overall, very happy with this product"
1,This item is plastic. It is NOT leather and has no leather in it whatsoever.,"The plastic covering is stamped to look like leather. As a result it looks like a cheap box with plastic covering trying to look like leather. The plastic covering is glued and not stitched and you can see the glue coming out of the seams where they are beginning to separate. The cover has a clear plastic top, not glass. Anything you put in this case would be degraded by its cheap imitation look."
3,Not as good as I thought,"I received the package on time and the quality matches it's description. The leather is nice and the padding on the inside is nice and soft. But when I opened it I noticed that it uses a cloth strap to hold the lid open, not hinges. If you look close enough you can kind of see in the picture on the left side. I didn't think it was a big deal until I put my watches in there and the then strap covers your watch on that side. It just doesn't look good, it looks cheap. The other thing is it's smaller than I thought. I don't have huge face watches 44mm and what not but even that size makes it tuff to put watches in next to each other with out them hitting each other. Good on paper but I'd pass this one up. I've gone ahead and ordered the XL 10 case watch. See how that works out!"
5,a great gift idea,"this fabulous watch case was a great gift for a co-worker. He stated that he was pleased with the item and never thought that this product ever exisited, thank you very much for the idea."
4,Great for what I use it for,"Needed spacers for milling, do not have to be ""perfect"" for my use. These fit the bill. They are much eaiser to use than a stack of metal plates."
5,"The Wusthof 10-inch Breadknife is the finest knife I have ever used for cutting breads, smooth, easy, light touch .","I had purchased several bread knifes before but none had peformed the task as well as the Wusthof 10-inch classic, it is light to handle, makes remarkable thin or wide slices with little effort and leaves a smooth uniform slice. It is so well balanced, there is no sawing or force needed to achieve a smooth beautiful slice of bread. I would recommend this to everyone who desires the best in bread knifes.Richard G. Bell"
4,Easy and clear,"I found that the tapes are very helpful and teaching is carried out in a slow and systematic manner. I have been listening to the tapes while driving and they are very easy to follow. However I feel that since some of the words are different and difficult to follow by merely listening to them, having the paperback edition will help. But I will highly reccommend these."
2,Missing a lot,"The book would be a lot better if it taught everything before asking you to use it. For example in exercise three of chapter one, you are supposed to use the correct forms of the verbs to be and to have, only chapter one does not taech the verb to have... then the exercise uses vocabulary also not covered in the chapter, or even listed in the glossary! Perhaps the author's intent is to make you work harder by cracking open your dictionary and grammar book, but in my opinion this edition is very poorly written."
3,Dated Material ...,I am using the book as one of the references for full time language study. Instructors regularly indicate that the materials are dated -- no longer current with spoken Romanian beyond the basics. Good reference and verb section.
1,Manufacturing defect,Within minutes of opening the shipping packaging I put the CD directly into car CD player to learn that track 2 and 3 jump skip or repeat moments. Inspecting the CD there is a black dot on the underside and a small lump on top where the black dot has been covered by the silver film of the data storage medium.
1,some course,"When I read that ""a"" was similar to the Standard English vowel sound in ""bud"", ""come"", ""done"" and ""put"", I needed not go further! The vowel in ""put""??? Does this fancy author know any English?So hard to find specialists in teaching foreign languages..."
2,Waste of time and money,"Usually I enjoy Patterson's books, but this one leaves a lot to be desired. This is my least favorite of all his books. He probably should have worked on it a couple more months. Read his other books this one isn't worth the money."
2,"Good start, then boring and undeveloped.","This was the fifth or sixth Alex Cross novel I have read, and it was, by far, the worst. It starts out good, with a terribly devious villain, but the last third of the book is boring, unsatisfying, too wordy (I was skipping whole pages without missing any story) and without logical connection to reality. It almost makes me not want to read any more of the Cross books, except I probably will because you can always find them in airports..."
2,good story...bad details,All the Alex Cross books that I've read are good but when an author doesn't get his detail right it really ruins a book. Case in point...when Alex take the safety off on his Glock. Glocks don't have safeties you can switch on and off like most guns do. So what we have here is an author whose trying to make his character cool by using a cool gun but the author doesn't know enough about what he's writing to be real. This is not the first time Patterson has made this mistake which only makes me wonder how many others he's made. Kind of makes me think he did just enough research to find out what the police in DC carry and that was that. He tells a good story but he needs to get his facts straight to make his books very good to great.
3,Longtime Alex Cross fan,"I find the character Alex Cross fascinating and with each subsequent book we discover more about him BUT this book got so far-fetched that it detracted from the character. While the killers in Patterson's books are getting more and more barbaric as well, we do see some of what is perhaps my favorite aspect of the books-Alex Cross's family life and how the busy homicide detective/Phd. in psychology attempts to deal with both.This book was definitely hard to put down but I did not go straight to the next one this time."
2,Could have been a lot better....,"Patterson has grown to be one of my favorite, but this book left me wanting something... the trial, Christine's disappearance, the quick deaths of the Horsemen.... I felt like there was not enough time to develop any of these things... Like a movie that can't be more than 2 hrs... I'm sorry but this one does not stack up high on the Alex Cross list... I know Shafer will be back and I hope Patterson will be back the type of story telling that has may many of us follow him."
2,"Interesting villain, nothing much else","Reading a Alex Cross book by Patterson means that you will get a pretty good characterization of the villain while every other character in the book , including the protagonist, is glossed over and given very superficial coverage. The plot is OK , but falls apart in the end, and dialogue doesn't seem to be one of Patterson's strong points. What is one of his strong points is, like I said earlier, the in-depth look he gives at his bad guys, explaining the motivations and origins of these characters. If Patterson seemed to be half as interested in exploring Cross and his supporting cast as he is the villain, his books would be a lot better. Also his plots usually hold up better than they do this time around. If you have to read every Alex Cross novel just check this out from the library, otherwise don't bother with it."
2,pop goes the Weasel,My favorite author failed his fans this time. Too much fluff and not enough plot.
1,Disapointed,This is one of the most disapointing books I've read in a long time. It was hard to believe it came from the same author as When the Wind Blows which was just superb. I have a hard time with books that are suppose to have the dots connecting especially when the 1st 3/4's of the book connect and in the final third they don't so that a sequal can be written! Don't waste your money!
2,Disappointed--not the usual Patterson,"Maybe he wrote this one too fast. Not up to his usual superior level of his past novels. Plot, what there was, moved at a snails pace and what was that all about? Christine having his baby in the jungles of Jamaca--come on!"
4,Great!,"This is a really fun and quick book! I read somewhere that people criticize Patterson for being unrealistic. The criticism is accurate although it should be said approvingly of the Alex Cross novels. Granted, there aren't too many doctor psychologists in police forces that are perfect physical specimens and decide to live in the inner city; but then I ask, don't we need heroes like Alex Cross? So what if it is unrealistic! I can turn on the 11pm news for all of the depressing realities. Take a couple hours away from reality and READ THIS BOOK: it is well worth it! PEACE"
4,It Succeeds,"This was my first experience with James Patterson and Alex Cross except for the 1997 movie, Kiss the Girls with Morgan Freeman. The book succeeds as a fast paced, barn burning mystery/thriller and to keep the pages turning quickly the 423 page book is divided into 124 chapters where you are always beckoned to read the next chapter. It is fiction: Alex Cross and his family are just too good (saccharine) and there are loose ends; but, hey, it succeeds."
1,Cranked out book,"After reading this book, I will not read another by this author. It appears he was given a large advance for a quick book. It was not proof read as there are several obvious errors with characters, timelines, etc. The story line was weak and unbelievable."
1,Pop Goes his Talent,"Like John Grisham, Patterson seems to be grinding out schlock, hoping readers will give him the benefit of the doubt. This book suffers from gore for gore's sake, a villain too psychotic to engage the reader, and a thin, derivative plot. Earlier Alex Cross books were far better, and Patterson is in danger of ruining a good character by making him boring. He should take more time to do research before writing, and find a better editor, because this book was a mess."
4,pop goes the Weasel,I thought this book was a good read. Alex Cross is a great detective. Although I had some trouble following the time in this story. The courtroom chapters were not enough for me. Trials are always a great part of a book. I look forward to the next book.
3,Pop Goes the Weasle(unabridged audio),"I was somewhat disappointed after awaiting another Alex Cross book for a long while. I found the ending (ie. pertaining to Christine) lacking in detail and it left me longing for more information about her ""lost year"". It was almost as if James Patterson ran out of time and could not fully complete the story. On a positive note, Michael Kramer, the reader for the unabridged version is fantastic! I think he could make any story sound good..."
1,What a disappointment,"James Patterson has scraped the bottom of the barrel for this one. Gross subject, poorly written (especially the dialogue between Alex Cross and his daughter), plot full of holes, and an ending that is laughable. One of those books that makes you wonder if his editor and publisher actually even read the thing before they sent it to typesetting."
2,why do writers change,"i have always enjoyed mr. patterson's books, but again another writer has fallen into the mode of other male writers of mystery/thrillers. i don't understand why they have to put a woman as a center of a book and write on and on about that one character. this book was more like a barbara cartland read then a good mystery/thriller type book. it had all of the markings/makings of his previous book, but he was engrossed with the female character and his family. sanford did the same thing."
1,Never Again!,"I thought I would give James Patterson another chance, but never again. Why does every other chapter need to have Alex Cross become mushy about how much he loves his family? I think it's great that they are so close, but it does nothing to add to the storyline. In addition, the dialogue is not believable and the errors are ridiculous. I almost stopped reading after the error in chapter 40. In fact, I skimmed the last 100 pages because I was so bored."
3,A bit like Ann Elk's description of a dinosaur!,"This was a book I received for my birthday so I would not of necessarily picked this one off the shelf, so to speak. I have not read James Patterson before and to start it was refreshing to read a book with a different style of delivery. Although the story was good it was a little slow to start, good in the middle and then went a little flat at the end, hence the cryptic reference to Ann Elk. With regards to the end, surely, judging by one of the main characters, if I read the character correctly, something else should have taken place. However I am prepared to read another one of his books, the sequel possibly, as there were to many loose ends in this one for my liking."
1,Awful,"This was the first Patterson book I read and, after all the hype, I was expecting great things. But it's shockingly bad!The villain is presumably intended to be the ultimate in evil, a sort of Hannibal Lektor for the new millennium. But Patterson just can't write like Thomas Harris and the villain is written on such a one-dimensional note of wickedness that he becomes laughable. And for a supposedly fiendish mastermind of evil, he's actually pretty inept.Even worse are the scenes with Detective Alex Cross's family and fiancee, which are glutinously cliched and sentimental. Does anyone in the world really talk this way?There's a splattery conclusion which boosts the body count but which is even more unbelievable than the rest of the book.Crude, inept and very poor."
4,Pop goes the weasel,"I read the unfavorable review from the other customers and I disagree. The chapters were short but this was a well written book in my opininon. I was disappointed at the end because I wanted to know what will happen next. But this is the very first James Patterson book I have ever read, and it prompted me into looking into some of his other novels which recieved rave reviews. I would recommend you read this book maybe after you have read some of the others which include detective Alex Cross and judge for yourself."
4,can't wait for the next one,"I have only recently been exposed to James Patterson's books, and have read all of the previous Alex Cross's ones these past weeks, and enjoyed reading them all, especially ""along came a spider"". With Pop goes the wiesel I was dissapointed to not know nor see how Christine was doing during the whole book, and often felt like Mr. Patterson was hurrying up to finish the book. I must say, though, that The wiesel was once again quite a character, and i'm looking forward to reading Alex Cross' next adventure."
2,Is he serious?,"James Patterson honestly had me going the first few chapters of this book. As I read on, not only did I become frustrated but I started to look for the receipt for the book so I can take it back. The plot was very thin and chapters were even thinner. I sure hope whatever Alex Cross sequel comes out , it'll be 10 times better than Pop Goes The Weasel.Patterson is lucky I couldn't give him one and a half stars."
1,Pop Goes the Series,"The plot and climax of the latest Alex Cross serial killer chase leaves the reader wanting the book, if not the series, to end quickly. The villians in this series are getting more and more cartoony, and the dull detours into the personal life of Alex Cross almost bring the novel to a halt. There is little doubt where the novel's plot will lead, and the climatic scene is difficult, if not impossible, to take seriously."
2,Does anyone ever edit manuscripts anymore?,"There are tons of errors in this book that even basic research and editing should have caught. It is almost as if more than one person wrote the novel and they did not keep each other informed. An example: At the beginning of chapter 27 Alex Cross tells his family that his girlfriend has agreed to marry him. They are all very happy. At the beginning of chapter 40 Alex says, ""Christine and I are going to get married soon, and then we'll all live together."" ""You asked her?"" they all exclaimed. Yes, in chapter 27 when you all got excited the first time. It makes for very choppy reading. You stop believing in the integrity of the story."
2,"Title should be ""Plop Went the Weasel""","Too many sub-stories, short chapters, and an excessive cast of characters are used to convey an over-abundance of information. The author seems to deliberately distort and exploit ""Manic-Depression"" symptoms to create the mind-set for the crazed villian. Once again, Alex Cross's family members and/or love interest serve as the central target for the book's villian (ho hum). The ending expects a lot from the reader who will turn the last page, shake their head, and wonder if they want to read the next book in the series."
3,"Good Thriller, but not GREAT..","Pop Goes the Weasel reads really quickly, I enjoyed it. BUT there is a HUGE editing mistake in that Alex delivers ""exciting news"" to his family twice in a couple of chapters. I thought I was losing it until I went back and confirmed this. How did Patterson AND the editors miss THAT?And while I read this book in pretty much one sitting, I agreed with another reviewer who said the ""duke it out at a Club Med Resort Ending"" is old hat. My main problem with the ending involved Christine and I can't explain it without giving away the plot. But suffice to say as I was reading that part I was like ""oh give me a break"".One other point, Morgan Freeman (great actor that he is) is way, way, too old to play Alex. How about Denzel or even Ving Rhines? Halle Barry would be great as Christine..."
3,Average for Patterson,"I love most of Patterson's other novels, but I found Pop Goes the Weasel to be average in comparison.The villian was kind of blah, nothing compared to Along Came a Spider. Plus, I never really understood what was going on with the game they were playing, it was never really made clear.Of course even the most average of Pattersons books are quite good, but I've just come to expect a better caliber of reading from his other novels. Of course that wont stop me from being first in line for his next book!"
4,Lighter side of Patterson,Typical Alex Cross serial killer. But being from D.C. -- he describes S.E. all wrong. I still love Mr. Patterson though and can't wait for next Alex Cross book.
3,Good but not Great,"Past Patterson books have opened up to let the reader fall in and make the great escape to Alex Cross' world. Pop Goes the Weasel has the potential to do the same but patchy editing keeps getting in the way. For example: When Christine agrees to marry Alex he joyfully shares the news with his family. They are surprised and pleased and there are hugs all around (page 102). Forty-one pages later Alex again tells his family he and Christine are getting married; they are again surprised and pleased and offer hugs. Alex's computer tells him, ""You have mail."" This sloppy approach coupled with an ""I'm tired of writing"" ending keeps the reader from getting caught up in the thrill of the chase."
3,Three points to review this book,"1) The ThrillerThe game part of the book is an excellent thriller, the way that the players play and the police investigate the crimes is excellent. Five stars for this part of the book.2) PredictableWhen the trial begins you will know who will win the battle, so this part of the book is boring because you will know the end of the trial no matter how good is the lawyers work.When the trial becomes to an end you will know exactly what will happen with Christine. Two stars for this part of the book.3) The abductionWhen a person is abducted for one or two days you will read faster to see what happened with that person, when the abduction is for a week or a month you just stop thinking in the abducted person, but when the abduction is for more than a year and you already know how it'll end is just pathetic, and the way they found Christine is... you will know if you finish this book. Two stars for this part of the book."
4,James does it again.....,I have been reading all the Alex Cross books in order. I was impressed with this one. I especially liked the ending - there was a nice little twist to it. It is an easy book to read with nice short chapters - the only problem is you tell yourself you are just going to read one more and then before you notice you have read another 100 pages ! BEWARE.
3,Mediocre performance,Really...is James Patterson trying to write a suspense story or a romantic epic. Pop Goes the Weavel starts off with enough suspense surrounding a British diplomat and three others trying to play a fantasy game which eventually turns out to be a true story. Then the whole plot weakens with a dash of romance. And there are gaps as far as time frames are concerned. And the whole episode of Christine being kidnapped is vague. I cant believe that James PAtterson tried to convert the suspense thriller into a soppy romance gig where eventually Christine is found with Alex's son. The ending was vague and made no sense. it was loosely finished. I wish James PAtterson would decide if he wants to write a suspense thriller or Harlequin novels. Alex Cross as always is the too-good-to-be-true detective who has it all. I think the character needs to be doing more investigative techniques than portraying his personal life.
4,for the Thriller Junkie,"Pop Goes the Weasel was intense and I just couldn't stop reading. A sucker for a good novel about serial killers, I thought the book was engaging and I got deep within the characters. My complaint is always that a book like this is easy to digest but leaves you still wanting more. If you are a thriller junkie you will love this book even if you haven't read any of his other books."
1,1 star is far too generous,"Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. The dialoge is awful, the plot is very predictible, and the characters are laughable (especially the villian). Very clumsily written. What ever you do, save your time and money and stay away from this book."
2,Predictable with no thrills!,"Having read all of James Patterson's Alex Cross novels, this one falls short of what I have come to expect of the Ace Detective. The book somehow as not connected. The murders, the game, the characters playing the game, the trial, the wife, the family, the doctor. . .TOO MUCH. By the time I made it to the end, and it was hard getting there, I was a little pleased. Despite this book I'll read the next. PS, three of us in the family have read the book. We each had the same reaction."
3,I missed Alex Cross,"Thank Goodness! Patterson is getting back to his roots and writing about my two favorite detectives from Washington - Alex Cross and John Sampson. ""When the Wind Blows"" - just plain boring. The new book ""Pop Goes the Weasel"", is well received. Alex Cross is back and just in time for the holidays. Now, this book is not the best of that Patterson/Alex Cross mysteries but it holds its own. There is a short part of the book - that makes you want to take five, but overall it is that quick fix of fiction that you will not get reading the monthly Oprah Winfrey pick....."
2,Editors/Proofreaders: Where are you!,"I am a voracious reader and like nothing better than a great plot and great writing. There's nothing worse than being completely engrossed in a book and then having glaring editing errors throw you out of the story! I've read the other reviews here and am glad that others noticed the same mistakes that I did. The same announcement to Cross's family on two different occasions; the recognition of a caller's voice, when in fact the previous contact was made by e-mail; and the fact that a conversation with the murderer's wife that occurs several days after one of the murders is remembered by Cross as having occurred on the night of the murder! For an author of Patterson's caliber, it would sure make a difference if he slowed down and the editors/proofreaders speeded up. I have enjoyed all of Patterson's books (with the exception of When the Wind Blows) up until now. Next time, rather than buying the book in hard cover, I'll get it from the library."
1,Painful,"The back cover states that James Patterson is the nations #1 mystery (or was it thriller?) writer. I doubt it. Have you ever read a passage of dialog so bad it's painful? Mr. Patterson manages it over and over. Basically, the book is not worth the time required to read it. I gave it one star since the form wouldn't accept 0."
2,pop goes the weasel,"When Jim Patterson first started writing, his stories and characters had depth, maturity and interest. Now with his last two novels I find his writing and storylines to be immature and geared toward an 11th grade education level. With dialogue that is right out of a high school play. I expect more from Patterson. Maybe he should stop worrying about producing the next ""Alex Cross"" novel-that he believes everyone is waiting for -and start concentrating on producing a novel that talks to his original ""mature"" audience."
4,Pop Goes the Weasel,This is not an animal. Keep reading folks. You are almost there. There is an end in sight. Really there is.
4,Pop goes the weasel.,The book was a fast read . the paragraphs were short and the story really held my interest. i will be reading many more books by this author.
4,Couldn't wait to get to the end....,"This was another great Alex Cross book. I listen to most of them on tape and simply adore the reader for Cross's books. I cannot understand the failure of this book to be a 4 or 5 star book as it's another amazing adventure, both in crime and in Alex's love life. I've found all of the Cross books and Murder Club books by Patterson to be simply wonderful reads (or in my case 'listens'). Most of his other books are great too, but a few are a bit off the wall. I'm thrilled that he writes so many books every year as he's become one of my all time favorite authors. His women are real women, not unlikeable bitches like so many male authors write. His men are real men. And unlike other authors, I don't get tired of the same characters. Great read...get it!"
3,Good start ...boring middle to end,"I am an avid Patterson reader ! This is not the book you would recommend for ""first time"" Patterson readers. The book started out exciting, but it got very boring, unrealistic and predictable towards the middle to the end."
2,What Happened to Alex Cross?,"Pop Goes The Weasel starts out with a bang. The villan is incredibly compelling. Unfortunately, he's the best thing about the book.""Kiss the Girls"" made me a fan of the Alex Cross series. This book does not measure up to the earier installments. In fact, Dr. Cross has become a very annoying, schmaltzy character. I couldn't stand to read the ""home"" scenes, I felt like I was reading a bad Oprah self help book on happy families. When Dr. Cross's fiancee is kidnapped, I couldn't have cared less.I skimmed through the the 2nd half of the book. This is the end of the series for me, I won't pick up another of these books."
5,BEST ONE SO FAR,This is the one book that scared the sh*t out of me. Geoffrey Shafer(sorry about mixing gary and geoffrey...i got soneji and shafer confused for a second...same initials and all)...incredibly psycho...the four horsemen gig is alittle lame...but thats fine. Patterson was definately at the top of his game when he wrote this book. If you dont care about reading the whole series...then just read this one...its still great...
4,"Great book, but I hope that this doesn't end the Alex Cross.","I enjoyed this book. I read it about 2 days which is very usual for the James Patterson books. Once again James Patterson proved that he is a great writer. Cat and Mouse is by far my favorite right now.As all James Patterson's book, it has its share of twists and turns. You will not disappointed that read it. I just hope that this does not end the Alex Cross series."
3,Pop Goes the Weasel,"This book is about what one can expect for the genre and I expected no more. What drove me crazy were all the inconsistences in the story line. Where is this man's editor? Anyone who is paying attention will pick up on them. Cross repeatedly remembered the words spoken to him on the phone in Burmuda, ""She's safe for now. we have her."" These words were never spoken to Cross but sent in the e-mail. All that was said on the phone was ""You have e-mail."" Before that Cross tells his family he has asked Christine to marry him and they are all so happy. However, everyone seems to forget the whole scene because he tells them again later and they are all suprised and elated again. Please, the reader deserves better than this ...."
1,book purchase,"I ordered a large print for my son, as he has very poor vision, he called Friday and stated it is not in large print. This is the first time I have had an issue with any purchases."
4,Exciting storyline ...,"This is the first book I've read by James Patterson, and mostly due to peer pressure from friends who couldn't believe I had never picked up a book by this author before... Patterson certainly has a way with storylines....and knows how to draw the reader into the script. There is enough action, details and excitement to keep the reader hooked.I have one negative comment when it comes to the way the story was constructed: Patterson tries to counterbalance the 'evilness' of his scenarios by using a 'perfect' hero (in this case Alex Cross) with the perfect life, perfect family etc.. If you have a difficult time with sappy characters, this can aggravate you after a while. I think Patterson tried to show the good versus evil stand off by doing so, but it comes out of left field."
2,TERRIFIC AUTHOR BUT A DISAPPOINTING BOOK!,"Anyone who has read James Patterson's earlier books knows he is a fantastic author, so what happened here? It seems that Mr. Patterson was in a terrific rush to give us something new and wrote this in a frantic rush to satisfy our craving for a new book. The result was disappointing. Few children, no matter how exceptionally brilliant and mature for their years, think and speak like Alex's daughter. The family scenarios, and the entire book for that matter, reminded me of little more than an over-dramatic soap opera. From the abduction of Christine to the final ending, the complete episode was just too weak, far-fetched and lacked substance.Mr. Patterson is a fantastic author. Anyone who has read his earlier books, ""Along Came a Spider,"" ""Jack and Jill,"" and ""Kiss the Girls,"" for example, knows how talented he truly is, but this book showed very little of the creative writing of the James Patterson we have come to know and love."
1,A Very Boring Book!,"This book is extremely boring and predictible. If your time is of any value, stay away from it.It is a pure waste of paper!"
4,good james,"This is one of patterson's most entertaining stories yet. Alex Cross is his typical brillant self & the villian is more twisted and confusing than ever. If you were sucked in to the earlier stories, you won't be able to put this one down."
2,Not the Patterson I have come to expect,"While I enjoyed the characterization a great deal (Patterson is wonderful with putting the reader into a character), the story, I felt was thin on plot compared to his past works. I found myself asking, is there something the author is holding back until later in the story? I was disappointed to discover there wasn't...the book was too predictable, also. The villain was probably the most convincing character. Patterson remains a gifted writer, but I have a feeling fans might feel a little let down by this formulaic storyline."
2,Big Disappointment,"This is my first Patterson novel. I found the characters shallow, the writing style sophomoric, and the ending not only highly unlikely, but also frustrating. I plan to read ""Kiss the Girls"" just to have another data point, but if it is not significantly better in all respects than ""Pop Goes the Weasle,"" it will be my last Patterson novel."
1,Painful reading.,"James Patterson is very hit and miss. One book will be an excellent thriller and the next will be a disaster. This is one of the disasters. The characters and story just never seem to come together. I had a hard time staying with this one until the end. I wish Patterson would pay more attention to details. He left much of the story confusing and there more than a few plot holes. If you are an Alex Cross fan it may be worth reading, but I can not recommend such a poorly written book."
4,Patterson in League of his Own,"Once again James Patterson proves what many of us already know. He is by far one og the bestb thriller writers today. Patterson brings back ALex Cross and the usual cast of characters, too catch another cold blooded murderer on the streets of Washington D.C.The killer this time is Geoffery Shafer a British Intellgence Officer. Shafer is somewhat different from other Patterson killers. He is not as clever as some, but is obsessed with killing. Shafer plays a horrible role playing game called ""The Four Horsemen"", however unlike playing role playing games, Shafer becomes his character and acts out his actions in real life. Quickly Cross is on the case and the chase or game is on.For anyone getting into thriller/fiction this is the best place to start. Patterson's quick short chapter style makes for a breakneck, heart pounding read. Patterson's use of the same format, plus little twist added with each book add to the fun. By far the best series writer out there today."
1,What happened to James Patterson?,"Boring, predicatable, Alex Cross is getting old and tired way to early in his literary career. Please, lets see a better effort the next time around."
2,"Same Ole, Same Ole, but not all bad","For someone who has obviously spent a fair amount of time in and around D.C. I can't understand the geographical errors. James, do you think you could cram any more corporate plugs in your book."
3,Major geographical error,"Patterson showed his ignorance of the DC metro area when he placed the mother-daughter murders in Fredericksburg, MD. I would assume he meant Frederick, MD, but he talked about Shafer driving south of DC, so apparently he meant to say Fredericksburg, Virginia (I live between DC and Fredericksburg, so I know!) I can't believe the editor missed that one, too."
4,Can't wait for more.,"As always, Alex Cross and his partner, John Sampson, are on the case. In this book, Alex's boss, George Pittman, tells Alex to ignore the 'Jane Doe' murders of the southeast. He says they are all just prostitutes and not worth their time. He is to investigate the murder of a wealthy white man. He is chasing a man they have named 'The Weasel' who also happens to have diplomatic immunity. Also throw into the mix Alex's fiancee, Christine, whom he met in a previous book when her husband was murdered. While on a family vacation in the Carribean, Christine is kidnapped and never found. Patterson makes you feel Alex's heartache, while at the same time, giving Alex the determination he needs to catch a sadistic killer."
2,What can I say?,"This was my first Alex Cross super detective / psychologist novel and I must say I was pretty dissapointed. The premise, British agents playing fantasy games and turning into serial killers...very lame the plot...pretty straight forward good guys always come through...but Alex Cross is so likeable that you just have to hate him. Characterisation...where did this family come from Disney land. Dialogue...tabloid newspapers have more depth. I really can't find a redeeming feature of this novel.Pulp novels make a come back from the 1930's."
1,"I've read better, much better","While the plot of James Patterson's Book, Pop Goes the Weasel, has potential, his writing style and character definition do not. The reactions and interactions of his two-dimensional characters are unrealistic and corny. It was like reading a (poorly written) romance novel. I wouldn't recommend it to mystery buffs or general readers and will not buy another of his books."
2,Dissapointing for the highly acclaimed author.,"I've read the other books in James Patterson's series following Alex Cross, but I must say that this was far beyond dissapointing. After a friend of mine suggested I check it out, I went immediately to buy it. It seems as if it were a story made for children with its overusage of plain disgustingness. The only reason I rate this book with any stars at all is because of the excitement of it. It went at a fairly rapid pace, and even though the plot was in one word stupid, it was a good read if you're looking for shallow. I was on the verge of putting this book down several times, but I need credit for classes, and for some reason or another reading this partiular book was said to raise my grade. I'm not so sure it will after the degrading report I give of it..."
3,The Weasel Pops too little too late,"I am an avid fan of the Alex Cross series and could not wait to dive into the latest one ""Pop Goes the Weasel"". I sped through the book as I do all Patterson books, but this one left me feeling a little cheated. The story started out really good, then spiraled down, seemed like Patterson was making it up as he went along. The ending seemed rushed and anti-climatic. I hope the next one lives up to the Alex Cross series better then this one did."
3,Page turner in a different sense,"This was interesting and readable, a page turner in the sense you were curious how it would resolve,not a ""suspense"" novel. It was rather predictable, not as exciting as previous Patterson books."
4,Vicious Weasel,"Another great Alex Cross story. He so loves his family and finally finds love after being widowed and everything looks like it's going to be great. Then comes the Weasel. What a heartless villian! Definitely disturbed and really puts Alex through the ringer and then some. A very interesting villian and just when you think you know all the answers, he throws in a few twists. Not the type of ending that I prefer, a definite end for the villian, but it kept me reaching for the next novel to see what happens in Alex's love life and where the villian will pop up next."
2,More of the same...,"James Patterson repeats his usual formula: impossibly clever and strong bad guy threatens Alex Cross's loved ones. The plot was interesting in the first few books but now feels tired and worn. If you've read the others, don't bother with this one."
4,Good Story. Too Much of Cross's Personal Life In It,"While this is no Mary, Mary it's much better than some of Mr. Patterson's later works. I thought this one of the more enjoyable Alex Cross & John Sampson novels. The story is good & the plot keeps rolling along.I do think there is far too much of Nana & his kids in it. The short chapters devoted to them really offer nothing to the story or plot.The jury is still out on the ending. The part of the ending dealing with the villain is good. The part dealing with Alex's love interest, Christine, I thought was corny"
4,Good Book!!!!,I must first say that although James Patterson has been writing for awhile I have only just acquainted myself with his writings. I find them all to be very good and this one is no exception. James Patteson creates great suspense and leaves you asking for more. His character Dr. Alex Cross finally finds happiness with a beautiful woman only to have it snatched away in the blink of an eye. Geoffrey Shafer is the ultimate diabolical bad guy. You just keep hoping that eventually he'll get his. Alex Cross' family life just makes you like him even more. I look forward to any book written by James Patterson.
3,Pop the Weasel,"James Patterson contiues with the series of Detective Alex Cross in this book. However, it is not one of the best of the series, but still satifies the reader's taste for more of the detective.Like always, Detective Cross must go up against a serial killer, this time a British Diplamate and like always the killer goes after someone close to Alex. One thing the book does have is an interesting court session with the British diplamate.Not Patterson best work to date. It doesn't come close to Kiss the Girls or Along Came a Spider, yet I can't wait to read Roses are Red, the next book in the series.If you like series books, these are good ones."
2,Tries to please everyone - and fails,"This book attempts to please too many fan genres - romance novel, thriller, cop story. It is impossible to try to appeal to a guy mentality and overtly appeal to fans of cheesy romance novels. I personally kept rolling my eyes at his over the top use of prose. The main character is this weird blend of super cop/dad/emotional wuss.The plot is fairly predictable and got old fast. It would have been far more effective if it was half as long. Shame on his editor."
1,Very shallow writing,"I thought this was one of his worst books. The writing was very shallow, the character development was weak. The author did not exploit the characters feelings in any significant way. When one's fiance is kidnapped and disappears for over a year, you would expect more from the loss than the occasional sentence indicating that he still felt bad. I found myself reading the story and wondering what else the author had going on in HIS life, obviously he wasn't real interested in writing this book. I felt like the author was in a hurry to write the book, and I found myself hurrying through the book so I could get on to something better.It left me still hungry for a story."
5,The BEST Alex Cross yet!!,"I have always found it difficult to put an Alex Cross novel down, but I simply could not stop reading Pop Goes The Weasel! Cross is up against a most brilliant, demented psycho who 'hides' behind diplomatic immunity!! Geoffrey Shafer is involved in a dangerous role playing game with three other ex-British intelligence individuals. Are they really only 'playing' or are they real, cold-blooded murderers? Cross's fiance, Christine Johnson, is kidnapped while on vacation with Cross and his family and although Cross knows that Shafer has something to do with it, he simply can't prove it. Shafer tries to frame Cross for the murder of a fellow DC detective and almost pulls it off! He constantly taunts Cross and is so clever at it.I felt really cheated when I finished the book because I really didn't want it to end. I envy anyone who hasn't read it yet, cause you're in for a real treat!"
2,Not One Of Patterson's Best,"Being an Alex Cross fan, I was looking forward to this new installment with a new evil menace. The weasel did not disappoint, but the rest of the book did. Too long and drawn out. I usually read a book at a medium pace so I can savor all the details. I found myself reverting to speed reading just to get to the resolution which was itself, painfully drawn out. I will continue to read Patterson though. He is not the most consistent of writers, but he hits a bulls eye fairly frequently."
3,JAMES STRIKES AGAIN,"POP GOES THE WEASEL WAS A GREAT READ! I AM AN ALEX CROSS FAN AND WISHED FOR A COMMITTMENT BETWEEN HE AND HIS LOVE. HOWEVER, I NEED TO ASK MR PATTERSON...EXACTLY WHAT DID SHE MEAN WHEN SHE TOLD ALEX THAT THEIR CHILD SAVED HER LIFE? I THINK I MISSED SOMETHING HERE...BUT OVERALL THE BOOK IS ANOTHER FAST AND GOOD READ."
3,Pop goes the weasel,"Good book. One of the best in the series. This book can be read in one sitting because it's so intriguing, definitely a page turner."
4,Very Good - Interesting Killers!!!,"Alex Cross is investigating a series of murders in Washington DC's southeast-area, and area the police does not care too much about, and where a murder a day hardly is a thing that raises any eyebrows with the people in the top of the city. But Alex and a handful of his trusted colleagues start their own investigation, and they are soon baffled by the patterne of what they belive to be a serial killer on a maniacal rampage. All the time we also get a good look into the mind of this psycho-killer, Geoff Shafer, a good British citizen, working at the British Embassy in Washington. To our killer, the whole world is beginning to look like a game, where you can determine your victim's fate by tossing some special dices.Alex Cross runs into a lot of obstacles, and also have to face some awful personal things in this novel. It is fast-paced and well written, and a very good read."
1,Horribly Entry to the Alex Cross Series,"I did not like this one in the least as it deals with a group of people who murder in a role-playing game they create over the internet and ends up coming off like a very bad Italian splatter movie complete with a banal plot, obviously no concept of internet security and wire tracing, cornflakes box characters and nothing of the kind of intelligence or pace that went into other Alex Cross books. Also the Cross backstory takes horrible turns becoming something like the Brady Bunch. Get the originals or a sequel like Cast & Mouse rather than this failure concept. Patterson totally lost it with this one."
2,Wish I Had Saved My Money,"I loved ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came A Spider"", but this book put me to sleep.It is predictable and I personally am tired of the ""filler lines"" about Cross's perfect children, perfect girlfriend, perfect partner and let us not forget the perfect Grandmother.It is almost becoming drippy! And Patterson repeats himself more than once in this book.I think the Weasel could be an interesting villain, and the game certainly kept my interest...but almost NOTHING ELSE DID."
2,Disappointing,"When reading a book, it's either going to be good or bad.. fairly simple. I listened to the CD version and I was so turned off by two narrators that I didn't care to listen to it any longer. I love James Patterson's novels and I was really looking forward to this one. However, I have to admit that I am a bit disappointed."
2,"A Piece of Dung, But Needed to be Read","I have read, and will continue to read, all of Patterson's novels, but this one was boring, with a ""capital B"". Anyone who thinks this book measures up to Kiss the Girls or Jack & Jill is off their rocker! Patterson should stay away from the law, as he knows nothing about it (as shown in Pop). In conclusion, while Morgan Freeman is a great actor (side note - the movie sucked), I keep picturing Denzel Washington as Alex when I read the books."
2,Alex needs more ?,"When I first discovered that James Patterson had written a new book I broke my neck to get it. After reading it though I find that it really wasn't worth me killing myself over it. Mr Patterson keep me enthralled with Kiss the Girls. ""Pop goes the Weasel"" makes me want to do exactly that POP! There is no depth or understanding to Alex's character, and Christine seems to get only passing mention in reference to thier relationship. If you want to make a movie out of this one you'll have to have stronger actors in order for the movie to carry it's weight. Might I suggest Laurence Fishburne or Ving Rhimes!"
4,Another gripping plot but a weak ending.,"Patterson delivered another interesting character in Shafer - well developed and the central focus of the book. Too much time was spent on Nana and the kids; these characters are completely unbelievable and always have been - it's time to let them go. Some of the twists and turns went sadly unexplained and the ending was completely unrealistic, until the final chapter. Predictable? Yes. But good? Absolutely! I do look forward to the next installation, I just hope Patterson will spend more time developing the plot and less time on Nana's lame advice."
3,Disappointment after such a long wait,"I just finished reading the book and have to say that I was a little disappointed with it. In comparison to the previous four Alex Cross novels the story took me along to time to get into and I didn't have the same ""can't put it down"" feeling as with the others. I also have to say that two years between novels in a series is way to long. When you have a hero as well-developed as Alex Cross you continue with the sucessful formula as soon as possible."
1,POP goes Cross!!!!!!,"Patterson latest shows signs of early retirement for the author. Dull,dull, and more dull. Is this the same guy who wrote ""Along Came A Spider""? Even his photograph looks different."
3,"Good, but not one of Patterson's best","Despite the spellbinding appeal of Patterson's writing, the innumerable plot twists and dead-end clues were uncharacteristic of past work. There was some sloppy police work as well. The search without a warrant of the Weasel's apartment and gypsy cab is a perfect example. The Epilogue was pure Patterson, however. The reappearance of the Weasel is assured."
1,More garbage.......,"Fool me once......Pop Goes the Weasel only confirmed what I suspected after finishing When the Wind Blows. Patterson is written out. Either that or he is subcontracting out his books. Never again for this reader. This makes two hardcovers I want my money back on. Pure drivel. I just finished Micheal Connelly's new book ""Void Moon"". If your want to read a truly great book, pick that one up. You will feel your money was well spent."
3,A quick read!,I'm an avid Patterson fan. I found his latest an easy read. At first I couldn't put it down than when Christine had the baby - oh well what next. Go on and read it but not as a first of Patterson's.
1,Terrible reader,"I'm sure this is a great book to read, all of JP's are, but the reader's voice was so annoying that I had to turn it off after 25 minutes."
3,the Cosby Show meets Shaft.,"Without a doubt Mr. Patterson has written another #1 bestseller fnas will enjoy because of the action and pacing. However the glaring grammar and usuage errors on top of run-on sentences and fragments took this one down a star but that wasn't nearly all... How perfect can one man, his friends and his family be? We need some debt of character to make one complete. Saturday morning ( and through the week) cartoons do a better job of development. It was cute in ""Along came the Spider"" and tolerable in his following novels. You can't help but like Mr. Cross but I'll pass on the conclusion to this one. Considering how long I anticipated this one, that's a shame."
3,Mr. Patterson would do well to get a new editor,"It is disconcerting as a young writer to see glaring mistakes in a bestseller's work. I found no less than a half a dozen mistakes that either Mr. Patterson should've caught upon proofreading, (if he even does) or at the very least, an editor should catch. Although these mistakes did bog the story down and make me wonder if Mr. Patterson only writes a first draft and figures it is perfect without reading it himself, the story does move. This is typical Patterson--fast paced. I still love Alex Cross.I did keep turning the page to find out what was going to happen next, and that's what a writer wants--a page turner. But I am thoroughly disappointed at the carelessness on the part of the author, his editor, and the folks at Little, Brown. Even thrillers need to be edited, not just fine literary works."
2,not as good as earlier books,mr patterson needs to slow down and write the alex cross novel that he is capable of writing.the news of alexs engagement is told twice to his family in this book they act like they heard it for the first time.there needs to be more caracter development. mr patterson are you sure you wrote when the wind blows.
4,Great reading! Was not able to put it down!,James Patterson writes another entertaining novel. His latest work is a book readers dream. The characters and story move at an avid pace. As a readers you will never feel as if you could put this book down. Once again the character of Alex Cross is the main focus of the story as we go along with him on his latest journey and we learn a little more about the intricacies that make up the man. Recommended to all of James Patterson's readers and to those who will become new followers.
1,Yawn,"If you consider McDonalds and Adam Sandler ""great"", then you're among the 5 star reviewers here and would think Pop Goes The Weasel is ""great"".The Alex Cross narrative is painfully amatuerish, the villian is flat, even the murders are dull. Although I'm sure its all just fascinating for anyone first learning to read."
4,Pop goes the Weasel,Fantastic book! Easy to read because chapters are 2-3 pages and with a busy schedule short chapters make it easy to keep up with. Stongly recommend any of the Alex Cross series.
2,Diappointing noevl,"I've been hearing so much about this series that I finally decided to go out and read this book. Unfortunately, I thought it left much to be desired. The writing is incredibly simplistic, and the plot is way to predictable. I have no way of comparing this to any of his other novels, so maybe I'm just not a fan of the series."
3,"Good, but forgettable","I read this book quickly. Once I started I couldn't stop, the short chapters is the primary thing that made it a fast read. I enjoyed the book but my problem is that it is highly forgettable. I have read all of the Alex Cross books but can hardly remember anything about any of the novels that I read almost a year ago. I remember almost all of the Patricia Cornwell novels and Susan Grafton novels but Alex Cross is just forgettable. The book is good it just doesn't stick with you."
4,Another great Alex Cross book.,"Pop Goes the Weasel is a great read.I put everything aside for five hours so I could finish the book.Alex Cross continues to be interesting and the weasal is a good villian.My only compliant is the ending seemed a little rushed, but that is a minor gripe.Any money spent on Pop Goes the Weasel is money well spent."
4,Keeps you guessing until the end,"James Patterson has created Alex Cross so well, that he can be hard to distinguish from reality. He is a wonderful father, an upstanding citizen, an excelent cop, and a brilliant psychologist.Pop Goes The Weasle, the latest installment of Alex Cross, gives his fans almost everything they could ask for and some they don't want!.Just when Alex is the happiest he has ever been, the events surrounding the latest psychokiller threaten to make this the worst time of his life (even worse than when his wife was killed).Will Alex pop the question to Christine? Will Alex prove to be a ""bad cop"", or worse yet a murderer? Will Alex lose what he holds dearest to his heart?Read this book, and these questions and more will reel you in and keep you hooked until the very last page.One caution! Don't read this book if you want a long read. I read this book in about 12 hours with no trouble!"
4,GIVE ME MORE!!,"Fantastic - another James Patterson hit!! I have become addicted to Alex Cross, John Sampson and the rest of the ""crew""..Give me more!! Another thriller that kept the pages turning, as quickly as I could read. Edge of my seat suspense as I waited to find out Christine's fate and whether Alex would be the victor in another game of 'Cat and Mouse'...James Patterson, my question for you is: Can't you write faster? I wait months for your next release and read it in a night! Definately worth the read, especially if you are already a James Patterson/Alex Cross fan."
1,There should be negative star ratings for books like this,"The plot has the makings of a good novel. Unfortunately James Paterson has no idea how to write one. There is no tension, thrills are ironed out with bland passive writing, and in the end who cares what happens to Alex Cross. I tried another Paterson novel and it was a clone of the first. don't waste money on this."
5,Pop Goes the Weasel,This series is fast moving and fun. You don't know who done it until the last. I love these books.
1,"If I wanted soap opera, I'd watch TV","Beyond a stinker! What happened to the tension, the drama, the STORY? I'm a reader, but I knew all along what was going to happen, maybe I should take up the pen. Totally predictable, and nine months later, a BABY! Too, too trite, with the funky clue planted too obviously. UGH, I'm not going to buy one of his again, will check it out at the library, maybe, and save my money for a good book."
1,"Patterson, puh leez","I read Kiss the Girs, a serial killer. Then Spider, aha, another serial killer. Now Pop Goes the Weasel, well he popped and we got that krap all over us. This book is for those who have a choice, Nancy Drew or Pop Goes the Weasel. Patterson uses quantity instead of quality. Forget this one."
5,Spectacular Thriller,"Once again we watch Alex Cross investigate a diabolical killer. A serial killer that seems to not fit into a profile. And the reason is, the killer was basing his actions on the role of a die; in a game called the Four Horsemen.In this book Cross finds out who the killer is. His name is Geoffrey Shafer and he has diplomatic immunity. He has been playing this game with three others for years on a world wide basis. Cross is forced into the game by the horseman Death.The thing I enjoyed the most about this book is that Cross finds out who the killer is and arrest him. The problem is their is no apparent proof. I could not put this book down. It is a page turner."
3,"An entertaining, yet rather shallow, read.","I have read all of the Alex Cross novels and have anxiously awaited this next edition in the saga. However, in what starts off as an extremeley interesting read, rapidly starts to lose it's momentum. A lot of sequences within the book seem to be unexplained, or explained quite poorly. For example, messages left to Alex Cross on his email and phone were not explained to be originating from Geoffrey Shafer, inconsistencies with the way the police linked Shafer to the southeast murders, Shafer appears to be in control and not wanting to be caught, yet he has a really major slip up which makes him the prime suspect - just doesn't make sense. I find that the book tends to be rushed at the end and that truly is disappointing because it had massive potential to be one of his best. However, it was entertaining and a worthy addition to the Alex Cross series. I eagerly await the next chapter."
4,"Good entertaining book, worth the money","I like all of James Patterson's books, but I just wish the ending of this book could have been explained a lot better. It seemed too rushed. The rest of the book I liked a lot thoough."
5,Excellent entertainment,"I love Patterson's style. This was a page turner, but I had to keep putting the book down between chapters so I wouldn't experience all of the terror at once. I can almost feel Alex Cross' pulse as well as his heartbreak in this book. The story certainly leaves you craving for more."
2,Patterson is losing it. Hopefully regains it next time.,"This book in hardback is not worth the hard cash. In paperback, it probably is. If ""When the Wind Blows"" was 1 star, this has to be at least better, but not by much. There is no suspense, intrigue and mystery, as in ""Cat and Mouse"" and ""Jack and Jill."" The story is so-so, not particularly creative or innovative. The characters are almost typical, and starting to wear thin and, in retrospect, become boring. Perhaps it's time to wrap up these characters, adopt a bit more hard-core approach, and less long-winded ""sappy"" style."
1,Nowhere near the action of previous Cross books,I've always enjoyed his Cross books. They've been written well with plenty of action. I got bored with the love scenes and would have liked more cop scenes.
3,Exciting,"I like James Patterson. This book was pretty good. It definitely was not Along Came A Spider or Kiss the Girls, but it was still good.There are a few things that I did not understand. One of them was about the Weasel, and his comings and goings to his house without being asked a single question. That really bothered me.The ending I thought was ok, because it prepares us for the next book.And yes, the books overall theme is the same. Alex Cross vs. a serial killer. But I still enjoy reading it, and I still cant wait to turn the page as I'm reading it. And I still very much like James Patterson's books.Recommended to any Patterson fan."
3,Fast Paced.......,"This is a fast paced psycho-sexual serial murder mystery. Alex Cross, the Washington D.C. detective is tracking down a killer who may have been in business quite a while. One of the problems is that the murders are happening in a part of D.C. where life is deemed cheap and Alex's boss isn't interested in solving them. The other problem is the murderer. He is street smart, he is intelligent, he is spinning into an ever increasing state of insanity, and he has diplomatic immunity. This may be one of the most dangerous criminal minds Alex Cross has ever dealt with, at great cost to his personal life. Very quick paced."
2,Too many family sidebars,"I love James Patterson books..they are quick reads with a nice quick pace and lots of suspense. However, one criticism I have and it really comes into play in this book--is his overuse of the family of Alex Cross. It is really too ""cutesy"" for my taste. The bad guy in this book was really cool and I loved the premise of the guy being untouchable, but let's lose the bogged down family interactions. Keep it to a minimum please!"
1,disappointing,"I am new to this series having read ""kiss the girls"", Is this the same author? I had to force myself to finish it to see what the ""hype"" was about."
3,the weasel is really nasty,"The fifth of James Pattersons Alex Cross novels, Pop Goes The Weasel, is one of the better ones. In my view an interesting villain is what makes these novels work and the Weasel is one of the best.Pattersons gives him a little more of a personality and that makes him more hateful and the way he strikes back at Crossis quite effective in terms of the story. This is a strong comeback after the abysmal Cat and Mouse"
1,James Paterson,"this is the first James Paterson book i have read and it will be my last. this book is not good, plan and simple. the graphic words and deresptions just made me not like it at all, it might make a good movie but for a book it was not good."
4,Alex is back...,"I love the Alex Cross series. In this adventure Alex must find a serial killer who is involved in a computer role playing game. Alex is also facing increased pressures at work with a boss that doesn't want him around anymore. However, Alex has found the love of his life...Christine.As usual, JPatterson does a great job of weaving each of these story lines and providing enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. The last 100 pages is so intense, you can't put it down!!!"
4,Sixth Sense ending Makes for excellent book!,Much like the sixth sense this book is entertaining but nothing special. That is until the ending which brings the whole thing together in a fast paced climax.
3,Mediocre,"This was the third Patterson novel that I've read, and the first involving Alex Cross, and I have to say, I was disappointed.The premise of the story is that a British dipomat with a taste for role-playing games is becoming increasingly violent and is playing out the fantasy game in real life, murdering innocent victims and then bragging about it on the internet. An idea with promise, but unfortunately Patterson uses far too many sterotypes to make it anything more than a run of the mill crime novel. We have the obstreperous police chief who thinks the murders are nothing more than random killings, the feisty black nana who's chock-full of traditional recipes and good advice, and of course, Cross himself, who is so wholesome that he makes milk look like straight scotch.This isn't a bad book, but if you have any kind of imagination at all, it is not going to light your candle."
2,"Great hopes, - greatly disappointed.","I was very excited to read about another Alex Cross adventure. From the beginning of this tale I was dismayed at the formula writing about the characters who had been developed so well in previous adventures. Then, to add to my disappointment, every time the story line seemed to sag, the author tossed in a far-fetched twist. Alex Cross had been such a strong character with viable and well researched story lines in the past. This book read more like a Nancy Drew mystery novel with a few bizarre red herrings. The storyline was strong enough to make into a memorable novel. I hope the author continues with more Alex Cross stories without cheating himself, his readers, and Alex Cross with another slip-shod attempt like this one. I'd recommend it to readers who have nothing else to read on a rainy day and had to borrow a loaner book. Not a keeper for a library collection."
4,Suspensful!,"I've never read a Patterson book, but I thoroughly enjoyed this. I couldn't put the book down. The only unbelievable part of the book was the baby being born....why did he have to add that in there....kind of ridiculous. Other than that, book was suspensful and I would recommend it for people who like suspense/murder/mystery type books."
1,"Plot OK, Writing awful","Though the plot of this book was interesting and worked well for its genre (suspense/thriller) the writing style was so juvenile and incompetent that I couldn't believe it had actually been released as is. Patterson seems to have only a basic notion of grammar and sentence structure, is addicted to cheating the reader out of drawing any of his/her own conclusions, uses cliche startlingly often, seems to adore passive voice and seems to now be a big enough name that his editor is afraid to correct him. Perhaps he should transfer his storytelling talent into screenplays, as his narrative voice is abysmal. Recommended only if you can overlook writing ability in favor of plot--I failed, which made this a frustrating read."
2,This one stinks!,"I liked Patterson's other novels but unfortunately, this one stinks. Poorly developed characters, contrived situations, holes in the plot. It bothers me that Alex received the message following Christine's kidnapping by email, but later in the story he ""remembers"" the kidnapper's voice delivering the message via telephone.I almost put the book down right then and there, and now wish I had. How quickly did Patterson dash this one out anyway? It also borrows heavily from his previous novels. This book smells of commercialism -- leaves you knowing that a sequel is on it's way (fast, I'll bet) to the press. I for one will not buy it."
3,Sinking Patterson Fan,"I was hooked on Patterson's writings from Along Came A Spider and have read every book since. After the disappointment of When The Wind Blows, I was looking for that ""can't put it down"" feeling from his other novels. Throughout the first half of the book all I found was a sorry attempt at a love story (no thanks)...but giving Patterson his dues the book did end with bringing the actual serial story together with some interesting (yet mostly unrealistic) scenes. Overall if you are a Patterson fan, it should be read but much of it you will expect...if you have not been a Patterson fan, it will blow you away."
1,Don't bother,There are some books that you don't expect much from. Books that you know will not be well written or that will not change your life. Yet we read them with no expectations other than a fast food kind of read. I take offense to this ignorant portrayal of a person suffering with Bipolar as a deranged serial killer. People who have this disease have enough trouble gaining acceptance from society without Mr. Patterson making one a demented murderer.
1,2 Dogs in a row for Patterson,I am so disappointed in this new Alex Cross novel. So simple and the ending was worse than The Client (and that's tough to top)
2,not very good,I order this used boook. It said it was in excellent condition. I was really disappointed. It was an old library book in poor condition. It was even missing pages 115 thru 130. Other pages are falling out. I hope you will be more honest about the coditions of you books from now on.
5,Cute little book,Great little book for toddlers to understand hibernation. we use the book for a prek class. I highly recommend this book. It is fun and great pictures
4,"A Solid, If Somewhat Dated, Collection of Translated Buddhist Texts","I think this is a solid introduction to Buddhist writings from Pali, Chinese, and Tibetan sources. It was collected and translated almost a century ago, and was one of the first collections of its type - Jack Kerouac and many other early Western students of Buddhism credit this book with being their introduction. From a modern Western perspective, now that we have so many teachers and other translations available, some of the commentary and translations seem dated, but I don't think any are incorrect. Also, the term 'Buddhist Bible' is misleading, because there is no one collection of writings that all Buddhist lineages acknowledge as the guiding book, ala the Torah, Koran, or New Testament. But this collection includes several of the main classics from varying Buddhist traditions, so as an introduction for someone new to Buddhism overall and interested in primary texts, and as a piece of history, this is a great book."
2,Where is the content?,"I purchased this book thinking that it was the same as a book I used to have back in the mid-90's of the same title by the same author. I assumed that this was just an updated version, but the majority of text has been completely cut out in favor of large print. Very disappointed."
3,"Good words, bad book","I agree with most of the other reviewers have said here, ""A Buddhist Bible"" is a good introduction to Buddhist scriptures. Unfortunately this book itself isn't quite worthy of the material it holds...within a few days of beginning to read it, the spine started cracking and a few of the pages, especially in the middle, began to fall out! Really gives you the feel of reading an ancient manuscript when it starts falling apart on you..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON!,"I ordered this book believing it was the complete version, since in the preview ""Contents Table"" shows it as the complete version. Instead, Amazon send me the reduced and cheaper version of this book. So, the book it's a classic, but you won't get what you want if you order it through Amazon. Instead, order the cheaper reduced version, or go to your local bookstore and buy the real thing."
4,"Not better that ""V"", but neverless, another Symphony X gem","This is the third album I have bought of Symphony X, the other two were ""V"" and ""Essentials of Symphony"". Like other reviewers have already said, I don't need to repeat how great this album is.The only thing that I don't agree with some reviewers is to say that this album is superior than ""V"". Although all of the album songs are great(my favorites: ""Incantations of the Apprentice and ""Inferno""), I didn't find the ""hair standing in my arms"" effect that songs like ""Evolution"", ""Absence of Light"" and ""A Fool's Paradise"" had in the ""V"" album. I felt that the ""V"" album combined better the dark musical effect Symphony X delivered with their explosive progressive style. However, I don't want to be misinterpreted, ""The Odyssey"" is definetively another Symphony X gem."
2,It's OK,"The music on this CD is really good; the guys in Symphony X are very talented. However, I outgrew all that jazz and nonsense about dragons and mystical eyes many years ago. I really don't like the lyrics on this CD. If I were to recommend better progressive rock music to listen to, I would say you should check out EVERYTHING that DREAM THEATER has ever done!"
2,Meh,"I can't help but feel that Symphony X are one of the most overrated bands around. There is nothing here you haven't heard before and it's been done far better. Almost all the songs here feel unfinished and there is a distinct lack of good choruses. The choruses are big, but the band seems to lack any true melodic sensibilities. The first track is pretty good, the second is terrible and the rest vary from poor to solid.The vocals are completely cheesy and in some of the softer sections, are so sweet that Celine Dion fans would cringe.I would say that The Damnation Game and Twilight In Olympus are both superior, though still far from brilliant. This one just isn't worth the effort."
1,Gimmicky talent,"1 1/2With rare flights of fancy that exceed many symphonic-prog cliches, technically minded soloing cannot breathe life into washed out, throaty riff-rock encapsulated by an over-bloated finale that cannot grasp the ambition it may have in mind."
2,What's up with you guys?,"I really dont get why everybody gives 5 stars!!!COME ON!They are great musicians but this album is definitively weakThere are some ""good"" songs like: wicked, king of terrors, turning. But that's allGo get the newmythology (v) or dwotthey're much, much better!Dont be bootlickersDream Theater's Train of Though is far better!Remember that Petrucci is the 27th whereas romeo is the 91th regarding to ""the 100 best guitarrist players over the world""."
2,So boring.,"When I first heard Symphony X, I was bored. I'm a musician myself, and I must say, they have technical talent. Yet, if you consider songwriting skill, they are unoriginal and lack any flavor. If you combine Dream Theater, Pantera, and Yngvie, you get Symphony X. With Yngvie, it was proven that neoclassical is just a pointless heap of exaggeration with weak musical substance. The point is, this album no better than V, which was overall boring as well. Odessey's long epic rips-off Dream Theater, and then precedes to be monotonous. The rest is just, well, Symphony X. Nice try, not good enough."
1,How To Ruin Awesome Music 101,"Good morning students. Today I will demonstrate how best to ruin some of the best guitar music I've ever heard. [the professor presses play.] Class, Michael Romeo obviously put a lot of effort into his new album, ""Odyssey,"" the only problem is that he made the same mistake that he makes every time... he put vocals on these songs.[professor walks around the room] If you give me harsh, heavy, hard-hitting metal, you better not give it to me with some bellowing megalomaniac doing his best ""Phantom of the Opera"" rendition.[professor leans on his/her desk] And you better only have drums, bass, keyboards, and guitars. Get rid of the strings. Get rid of the sappy piano. Then we'll be talking 5-stars. But, class, right now we're talking 1-star."
4,"Good, but not great","Ok, first i really like this cd evryone is super talented. HOwever thi is not my opinion of great. MIchael romeo is an outstanding guitarist its just that he sounds a bit too much like a certain swede, noneheless he can really play its jsut that it is somewhat unoriginal. his riffs are very heavy and have great tone. Many people compare this band to dream theater an i definitely see the comparisons, at points it sounds lie dream theater with yngwie playing the solos. Also many people compare michael romeo to john petrucci, in my opinion i see petrucci as being a much better guitarist he has more muscle in his playing where as romeo is vry delicte in his touch on the solos. Also petrucci can be in credibly melodic at times and once again i find romeos playing to be a little unoriginal and repetitive. NOw though the singer from symphony x blows James la Brie away a agreat vocalist for this genre. All in all i recommend this cd but, it does not deserve the hype it gets"
5,Great!,"This is a perfect piece of work! All the musicians sound better and more determined than on their previous record. But I have to admit that I like ""V: The new mythology suite"" better because of the epic quality of the songwriting. But at the same time, ""Odyssey"" offers what ""V"" lacks, just as the two discs of ""Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulance"" are kind of complementary in style. Another often used phrase that fits for ""Odyssey"" might be ""riff - oriented"". In fact, the title track is an overture, followed by the different stages of the journey, which each are in essence some exellent guitar riffs.One word about the bonus track: GREAT songwriting! It's a good example of how Symphony X sounded before ""V"". If you like it, you might love ""Pharao"" of their astonishing ""The Divine Wings Of Tragedy"".By the way: While writing this review, I find that there are three stages of Symphony X: pre ""V"", ""V"", and post ""V""."
5,they just get better & better...,"I'm not going to critique each song/riff, but let me just say as a fan of the band, this CD is just fantastic. It seems with each studio effort, Symphony X just gets better & better. This CD has a harder edge than V. All band members are featured and give their best effort. I recommend it. Some of their best work to date."
4,A Good Listen,"Symphony X has done it again! Those familiar with the band will recognize the heavy riffs and backup flute jams. I gave this album only 4 starts because I felt the band did not build upon the album ""Live on the Edge of Forever"" which was just as heavy and just as hard."
4,What a Great Tool for my Store,I run a deli market and always wanted a camera system that works. Since this is a small business I don't have the capital to put in a full camera system like the bigger franchise. I'm so glad there is a reputable company like Sony that has decided to make security cameras that is affordable and easy to put together. It took me and my teenage boys about an hour to get two cameras hook up. Plus it comes with the recording software. The only thing is the size of the camera. It is larger than the one's I've purchase in the past but the picture quality is far better. My advice is to go with this camera.
4,Wonderful album,"For my money, this is one of the best of Flack's albums. She really changes pace here, recording some really upbeat tunes such as ""Why Don't You Move In With Me"" and ""Fine, Fine Day"", but it's the ballards where her voice soars. ""Twenty-Fifth Of Last December"", ""The Closer I Get To You"" (with Donny Hathaway) and the myserious and lush ""Where I'll Find You"" are all breath taking. In fact, ""Where I'll Find You"" is one of my favorite tunes ever recorded by Flack. I understand that it is from a Ken Harper (The Wiz) production called ""Bamboo"" of which I've never been able to track down any information on. Also, unfortuately, some of the lyrics (especially in the bridge) are difficult to decipher. If anyone can supply more info on this song, please e-mail me. And back to the album, this is a must for anyone who cherishes Flack's lush interpretations and consistently smooth products."
1,The Logic Book,"What an AWFUL book! Very reader ""unfriendly"". I had to use this book for a symbolic logic course at the University of Alberta. I found it very frustrating because the examples were few and far between, and were not explained well at all. One has to ""guess"" an awful lot. Don't even bother with the accompanying solutions booklet. Couple this book with an equally vague prof, and you will not be a happy camper! Now that I'm done University, I'm selling mine......another student can now be frustrated to no end."
3,Logic Book Student Manual,"This was required reading for one of my daughter's college courses. I don't feel as though I can give an accurate review of the content of the book. However, I can say after a semester of this class, she doesn't seem any more logical than she was before she took it! So, either the book wasn't the greatest or perhaps it was the teacher that wasn't very good!"
2,FAR FROM THE MADDENING CROWD,"The film has a zombie feel to it. Daniel(Alton Milne) is fleeing infected humans in his Volvo when it runs out of gas in the Scottish countryside. He manages to make his way to a farmhouse where there is a young woman and nurse (Sandra Louise Douglas) who has managed to survive the viral outbreak. She is a tough cookie who shoots first and doesn't need to ask questions.She has a past that is explored in flashbacks. Daniel is not as tough as her. The film examines the pyschological aspect of a ""zombie"" killer, someone who might be a bit insane to begin with. Then another woman shows up who Daniel does not want to kill. The film uses flashbacks and dreams, but not effectively. Ho-hum. A bit lame.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity."
3,"Nice Atmosphere, Slow Movie","This low budget ""zombie-like"" flick(i.e. 28 Days Later 'crazies') is not terrible but it is pretty slow. The look of the film is interesting, obviously shot on a lower budget camcorder giving it a gritty look with a dark washed out color treatment. That bit I liked, it gave the nightmare sequences an especially creepy feel. However the camera work itself is terrible in my opinion. Constant ""dutch tilts"" give this film a cheesy feel that could have otherwise been avoided despite the low budget. The acting is okay but none of the films few characters have any real development which leads to the incredibly slow and uneventful plot. Nothing happens of any interest in most of this movie. The end is decent but it's a chore to get through. Despite my complaints I'm giving this 3 stars for a valid attempt and for the creepy parts."
1,Weak!,"The highlights are it has good quality, good capture and all of that. The problem is getting the video+audio on another media, ie, DVD or whatever. They have one export feature and that is to AVI, and all it does is export the video. Why have a microphone to record sound and no method to export the audio+video. Anyways, called Sony, and they told me that this camera was not designed to do that. Quote, ""it was designed to playback on the computer only."" What kind of junk is that? 1 star!So if you only want to see the audio and video together on the computer, then this is for you. If you ever want to export your video recording to DVD or anything else, forget about it."
1,"Manuals, installation software horrible","Maybe it's a great camera, but unable to get it working at all. Installation software is really horrible, manual is even worse. Can't Sony hire someone who speaks/writes English? Install software is very strange, they don't understand the conventions/basics of writing a Windows application...really disappointed and frustrated."
3,red-eye?,"This camera seems great so far, except for the fact that I get many pictures with red-eye. I have read through the manual twice to correct this and it still happens. The manual says to tell the person to look into the camera to avoid this, well it still happens. For the money you spend on this camera, you think this would not happen. My Sony digital camera rarely has this problem."
5,"Canon Is The Best, As Always!","I bought this Camera in October of 2004- when the product was first released. I have had zero problems with it, and have nothing but the best things to say about it's photo capabilities.I think that this is the best balance of quality for the price. Besides, you don't need more than 7.1 mp for any photography. If I shot photos in the full 7.1 mp I could make life size posters!The true test for this camera (to me) was when I went on vacation up the California coast. I shot the most amazing pictures in Big Sur. The detail was exquisite, and the color was amazing. Since I have purchased this camera, my PhotoShop days have been over. I never have to adjust the color of any shot I take, and that is why I love this camera so much.If you are looking for a camera that has the capabilities of an SLR without the size of an SLR, this is definitely the one to get."
5,"Great resolution, with tons of features","There's no doubt about it, the S70 is a great camera. Its small enough to carry with you (though a little too big for pockets), has a nice LCD and boasts amazing 7.1MP resolution. You can print out an 11x14 poster of your photo without having to stretch the image, that's how great 7.1MP really is. Also, its got tons of features for a non-SLR model that are easy to use for camera beginners."
5,Best shooter I've played,"This is possibly the most under-played and under-rated shooter of all time. It is better and more customizable than any I've played, and still retains lots of reality and re-playability. This is also extremely rare for me to give something a 5 star, but this is perfection."
1,"One Star for Gameplay, But Quality Sucks.","Just another announcement:Basically, the PS3 version is not worth purchasing. The quality of the picture is too blurry. Just creeping around, achieving undetected from your enemies is just a waste of time, since you too can barely see them haft the time. It's like playing a PS2 game on your PS3. A very bad port to the PS3. I'd get the sequel, Rainbow Six: Vegas 2.DON'T BUY IT FOR THE PS3!!! Either get it on the 360 or just get the sequel. The picture quality is important when playing. I don't understand why their are so many perfect scores when the picture quality sucks... unless someone can help me with it. Don't bother telling me about HD... it's like tell someone about Wi-Fi, 3D movies, the IPhone, Droid, the world is round and it revolves around the sun. I got it. That's not the case."
2,Eh... Its ok,"I just purchased this game today from Gamestop. I've played it on the 360 and it was alright. I enjoy squad based shooters, but not this one. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but only for the people that like squad based shooters, I'm not a big fan of em. The graphics don't blow my mind, they look good, but not amazing like Ninja Gaiden or even Resistance: Fall of Man, If you have the money, I HIGHLY Recommend getting one of those 2 if you don't already own them."
2,Not very good.,"Nothing is very stand-outish in this game, looks quickly put together to mass produce. It's okay on co-op but that's about it."
2,LAST CROSS PLATFORM GAME I BUY ON THE PS3,"Well I bought this game yesterday for the PS# console, and once again I was dissappointed. I have bought other games on the PS3 and none of them have impressed me. Now I have all three systems, so I am not biased to anyone of them, but the PS3 calls itself the most powerful gaming console on the market. Well it needs to have games that look like it! This game gets blurry at times and the sounds are way off. For instance, at a few of the times in the game I commanded my team to open a door via explosion and the explosion would happen before the door opened! I must say that this is a fun game, but the ""jack up"" graphics deter from this games potential. Lets not talk about the online multiplayer.... It looks like a PS2 game. The whole game looks like a high end PS2 game. So I must say, If you own a PS3 and you doint mind a sub par graphics, then pick this one up. If you own a 360, then pick it up through there!"
2,ok - but only allowed to have 1 saved game - thus 2 stars!,"Very bad if you mess up, there is only one save point. At the last level it appears there is a glitch where many game users are having a problem with reloading the level (Nevada Dam - Warehouse)where you see Irena thru window - then game crashes destroying the one and only save point. This has happened to several users. According to UBI support you must delete the one and only allowed saved game and reload/restart the game from the beginning again. I tried this twice, and it crashed twice! So I gave up! UBI programers need to learn how to allow multiple save points.Overall the game has good picture quality. Content ok. But for PS3 there are no updates. So I advise buying it used and trying it."
2,Made for Profit,The gameplay gets somewhat old after a couple of hours. There isn't really a chance to get new weapons. The AI swear tons and aren't very smart. The graphics look ps2 at best.
1,Ehhhhhhhh!!!!!!!,"I originally purchased and played through (and am still playing through) Vegas 2, and I absolutely love it. Vegas 1 was a huge let down after playing # 2. The graphics are fuzzy, even on my flat screenm which means I struggle to see the terrorists at long distances, but they still see me. And with two different discs (I have tried two different copies) the snake cam has failed to work (which is a vital part of regular game play). I am done with this game and will just stick with Vegas 2 which is by far my favorite shooter."
1,Absolutely terrible translation to the PS3.... Sorry I bought it! Stick with the 360 version.,"I have both the 360 and PS3 and am very sorry I bought this game on the PS3 instead of the 360 - I was thinking that the PS3 version would be better refined and higher resoltion graphically but I was WRONG.It doesn't hold a candle to the 360 version graphically or ease of play wise (if any part of this game can be called easy!) - the 360 version is much more responsive and graphics make a HUGE difference when you're trying to get the bead on a naughty terrorist...Avoid this game on the PS3, buy it on the 360.Sorry to all the PS3 pundits out there, but this is not the best work."
4,decent but not great,"If you are looking for a game to play at the level of Resistance Fall of Man, this is not quite at that level. The graphics are decent but I think it could have been brought up a couple notchs. The game play is fast and I haven't noticed any problems with the frame rates yet. I still have to get onto multiplayer since I am learning the controls and my review is based solely on the single-player game. So if you are dying to get a game for your PS3 since there is such a lack of titles its pretty good but it still has a ways to go to be great. It seems that most of Ubisofts ports that have come over to Sony consoles were always a bit short of the 360 versions and this is no exception."
4,Very COOL game,"This game is sooo Cool on the PC, but i never really played the multiplayer version of it. But i'm definately getting it for the PS3, highly recommended. Only thing that sucked is that i had to cancel my order, cuz the shipping got delay from 2 day shipping to 11 days...so i'm just gonna stop by ebgames and get it."
3,Worse than the Xbox 360,This games gameplay is OK. The reason it got a 3 star rating is because the graphics on it suck compared to the Xbox 360 version. Also this game no long is tactical like the old Rainbows. It's more like run and gun now.
3,Worse than Xbox 360 Version,"I bought this game 2 days ago because I loved the Xbox 360 version which I played around 10 times. It was strange from the beginning because the graphics are blurry, for a moment I thought it was my settings but it wasn't. The PS3 version sad to say is subpar compared to the 360 version. The sound varies, Joanna's voice in the chopper would be too loud while the rest are weak even if you adjust all of them at the same level. The game play still looks good but it doesn't look like you're playing an HD game. I thought my eyes are going but it's really the graphics of the game. I have all 3 systems and loved my PS3 because my 360 is at MS repair center. Now I'm having second thoughts whether to get the PS3 version of Call Of Duty 4."
2,Juego de calidad regular,"El juego sí es entretenido, sin embargo:Es sumamente corto, predecible, y tiene el final más sin gracia del mundo (y así pretenden que uno se compre la segunda parte).Para tratarse de un juego de PS3, los gráficos son de bajísima calidad."
5,"Excellent, one of Salvatore's best books",The title to my review says it all. This is one of Salvatore's best books he has written. I was a little skeptical about the book at the beginning but I was hooked once I got deeper into the book.
4,Grood Story,"This was a good book, but not near as good as those with Drizzt. However, if you like R.A. Salvatore you will definately enjoy this collection. I feel that the upcoming novels with the Higwayman will be much better and more action packed than this initial series that has a lot of character development."
5,Best Salvatore book to date,"I read a lot of Salvatore's book. I usually like them, because there are fast-paced, and filled with action. I didn't know a new book from Mr. Salvatore's was due out. I just stumbled across it at the library.I didn't except so much from this book. But in the end, even though I was really busy at work this days, I managed to read this book in about a week.This is in my opinion the best Salvatore book to date. It's really entertaining. Really fun to read. The characters are great. The conflicts between the 2 great churches are interesting, as is the political aspect of the universe. The world is really credible. There is no ""bad guy"" per say in there. Just people with their own hidden agenda. Human beings. And that's a good departure from the usual Salvatore novelI sure hope more of the Highwayman is to come."
4,The Highwayman delivers,"If you like a fantasy story about a young downtrodden boy overcoming all obsticals to beat the bad guys, this is it. RAS again delivers on the action sequences and while the storyline is a bit formulaic, it is a good formula. With Salvatore, you can't be pretty sure you know what you are going to get, and the Highwayman is no exception."
3,good but not great,"I've been a huge fan of Salvatore for a long time, but i feel like this book was pretty predictable in the general plot. To me it kind of seemed like Robin Hood with a twist. It was a great book as far as the action scenes. I don't feel that anyone can write action as well as Salvatore, but i just didn't buy the plot. A good book and a fun read but nothing mind blowing like the dark elf trilogy either."
2,Ehh....,"Some spoilers(ish).This was an average book, but terrible in comparison to Salvatore's others. The book is split up into three different time periods ten years apart from each other. I felt as if I was reading three short stories, not of which were gripping/entertaining. The title character isn't even involved until the second ""story"".While Salvatore does kill off characters along the way, the main character showed an aura of invincibility and seemed as if he could fight any amount of opponents of any skill and I knew he would win without much struggle.I am a huge fan of Salvatore's other books (namely those involving Drizzt and Cadderly) and found myself finishing the book just for Salvatore's sake. I doubt I will continue the series."
4,"Good , but not Rob's best","R.A Slavatore has written books worthy of a second read, this one however is not one of those. Good book, good characters, intersting twist with the asian inspired enlightenment,but just not enough to make it a great book worhty of a second read."
3,3+ stars.,Story was too simple. Was not detailed enough.I guess the 5 stars from everyone else must have increased my expectations.Enjoyed the Fool and Fitz's ending story much better.
4,One of my favorites of the 90's,"This is a sweet album. The single ""Dreamtime"" got some decent airplay on MTV's 120 Minutes, and alternative radio back in '90-'91. If you like The Pixies, Throwing Muses, 10,000 Maniacs, Blondie, R.e.M., etc., you'll probably like this. Gil Norton did some production work on this album-- he worked with those first 2 bands I mentioned, and he always gets a killer guitar sound, no exception here. The songs are ALL very catchy and terrific. Dark and brooding, then poppy and rockin'. Maybe it because I was 17 when I fell in love with this band, but they really put out 2 great, great albums with this one and Jubilee Twist which I like even more I think. There's a 3rd one out there somewhere too that I forget the name of and it's not on Amazon at all. If you're a real alternative-college-music-guitar-rock-cool-guy/gal, get this album."
5,DREAMTIME,"I don't remember how I found them, but I finally did. The guitar bands of this time (especially female fronted), were great, awesome. They have the spiky, female attitude, then the dreaminess of the shoegaze sound that was big at the time (in the indie scene at least), and you have a great time.This is a band that is a great discovery for me, a fan of shoegaze and house of love and post punk from this time. It helps fill in the gaps of bands I missed."
2,Mundane storyline,"Paperback has a very shallow, typical plot. Although I completely read the book, it was a struggle to finish simply because of boredom. Entertaining would not be an adjective for selection of this D. B. Newton (aka Clement Hardin) paperback."
1,It's god awful,"This net is just terrible. I took one slap-shot at the ""strong material"" And it cracked. If this was a one time occurrence I would be fine with it but it wasn't. I bought three of these pieces of garbage until eventually I just gave up. Make the better choice and just buy the metal net from the start."
5,Great backyard hockey/soccer net,This is a fun item for anyone who has kids. Great size for hockey and can be used for many other backyard sports.The kids love it.
5,Ruffin is an expert on this topic!,"I have not read the book, but I am taking a European history course from C. Bernard Ruffin. He is able to give the last words of a great number of the people we study from the 1300's to present. And if he doesn't know their last words, he probably has them in a book. I am very sure that if anyone should write a book about death bed quotations, this man is the one to do it."
1,an appalling look at a degenerate culture,"the black culture portrayed in this book is absolutely appalling. children stealing from their parents. parents drinking away their wages and failing to feed and clothe their own kids. constant violence within the ghettos of teenaged hooligan rapists and murderers. and teenaged girls almost always falling pregnant as soon as they have the briefest holiday from school.no matter how much they suffered under apartheid, there is no excuse for these peoples' behavior. although the book is well written, i came away feeling a total sense of disgust for black south african society and a lot more sympathy for the whites who tried to keep them at bay."
1,Very poor - returning this deck,This is a Majors only deck - the minor arcana are pips only. not work the money. I returned it.
1,Creepy images,"I am a long time student of Tarot, and use Wang's excellent text, ""The Qabalistic Tarot"" as a primary source. Since I find his insights into the connection between Qabala and Tarot invaluable, I thought I would order the deck he created. I found the images creepy, and the human forms all white, pasty and weak looking. Wow. For someone who makes the case that the knowledge at the basis of the Tarot came from Egypt, in Africa, the Eurocentric look was appalling. I despised this deck, and wanted it out of my house."
1,Not a readable deck,"I collect tarot decks and have long been interested in Jung, so I thought this would be perfect for me. Unfortunately, I find it very hard to read with these cards. The reason--ironically for a Jungian deck--is that the people in the images have such specific features that it is very hard to see them as generic archetypes. It's a bit like seeing your neighbor on a tarot card--I find myself wondering who the models were and what their lives were like. This might not bother other people, but it drives me nuts when I'm trying to focus on a reading. The cards aren't particularly aesthetically pleasing, either, so they're not the sort one would buy to keep on the shelf and cherish. Intellectually, they're interesting but would be more so with at least a small booklet explaining the artist's thinking--it's a little annoying to have to buy a separate book in order to have any explanation whatsoever. In short, an interesting deck but no use to me."
2,Way to Predictable!,I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Sparks other works - The Notebook and Message in a Bottle. I was however disappointed with a Walk to Remember as I found it lacked depth and was extremely predictable.
1,Shallow,"I really expected more from this author as so many movies have been based on his works. I never quite got reeled in and it seemed more like a novel for teenagers, not adults."
2,Don't buy,"This is one of those rare cases where the movie is better than the book. I don't think Sparks did a good job of writing this one. The main character doesn't sound authentic. He sounds like an old guy trying to talk young. I don't think Sparks remembers his high school days very well. I like the story concept, but Sparks did not execute well. I recommend the movie, but not the book."
2,The Sweetest Movie?,"A Walk to Remember is one of the best movies i ever saw?I was once at a friends house and we were watching the movie and it was about 3:00 thta morning and there was ten people watching it when then end came one of my friends starts to cry and laugh at that same time it was so fuuny and so sad at that same moment? And at the end was the sadest end to it?And that could be a lesson in life take chance and become something you now you can become? take chances? Become something?And it was all because of her?kayla,13"
5,A Real Tear-Jerker,"For all die-hard Nicholas Sparks fans this is a must-read! If you haven't read any of his books, this one will definitely get you hooked. The prologue mentions, ""first you will laugh, and then you will cry"" and this couldn't be more true. I have read it over 5 times and I enjoy it just as much each time. Reading this book you become absorbed in a different time and place, where things were simple and innocent and true love was all that mattered. Once you pick it up you won't want to put it down!"
3,not particularly impressed,"I read A Walk to Remember at the frantic insistence of my best friend who, after reading it in one sitting, proclaimed it the best book she'd ever read. I, however, have yet to conclude why everyone is so in love with this book. Yes, it's a very sweet (though sometimes very cheesy) love story, but it was so predictable that it was almost dull. Sparks's foreshadowing leaves absolutely no room for surprises. If you're a diehard fan of love stories, you'll probably like it...otherwise, I'd pass."
2,Not Nicholas Sparks's best work,"This book didn't resonate with me the way Sparks's other books did. Although it was sad, the characters didn't touch me enough to make me cry. After reading Message in a Bottle I was really eager to watch the movie when it came out. I have absolutely no interest in seeing A Walk to Remember - The Movie."
1,Too boring to bother with.,"Fortunately, compared to others who rated this book likewise, I didn't spend a cent for my copy, and I'm glad I didn't waste my money. It came free with a book club offer. The plot is simplistic and predictable, the characters, even for the fifties (my generation), are unbelievable and the writing style is that of an eighth grader. Although a Christian and one who appreciates a well written work of wholesome literature, I did not shed a tear as a result of reading this title. I sincerely doubt Mr. Sparks would get a passing grade in a college level composition course if he turned in this kind of work. As far as I'm concerned, this book is a real ""sleeper."" I am astounded at the number of people who give it a five-star rating. For my money, I'll stick to Jane Austen, the Brontes, Charles Dickens and others of the classics genre -- authors who've stood the test of time and have given their readers something to sink their literary teeth into."
2,Not His Best Work,"A little too syrupy for me. Keeps reusing ""if you know what I mean"" - probably as a device. It doesn't work - if you know what I mean."
2,Disappointing -,"I read Mr. Sparks first two books and thought they were beautiful. I especially cried at the end of ""The Notebook"". I cried so hard, I couldn't see the words on the pages. ""A Walk to Remember"" was a real disappointment. Sounded so much like ""Love Story."" If this had been his first book, I don't think it would have been published. A few passages were good, but not many. Because of his other books, I knew how it would end. Hope his next is better."
2,Thank God I saw the movie first,This book ... but thank God I saw the movie first. The book was only good for one thing . It helped to clarify the title of the movie and book. In the book Landon is not that bad boy that lured girls in the movie. He is as cookie cutter as they come. Jamie is absolutely perfect though. Nothing about her changed. Save all your money to buy the movie and skip this stupid book. you won't regret it.
4,"Heartwarming, heartbreaking...","I saw the movie (adaptation) of ""A Walk to Remember"" and really liked it, a very simple, down-to-earth, heartwarming, heartbreaking movie, a story that makes you want to be a better person, and be a small role in this bigger part of the world.I was told the book was more interesting and it definitely IS! A lot, and I mean a lot of details were taken out of the movie context, and at times the ""space and time"" settings were not clear, after reading the book only did I understood what was really meant about ""A Walk to Remember"". The movie has done the book, the story injustice.If you are feeling really down and out, try reading this book, it would make you feel better, that there is the thing call 'Love' in this world, in many forms than you can think of."
3,A Walk to Remember,A Walk to Remember was about a girl named Jamie who no one likes at school and is a great Christian. She helps out a lot and kids think she's weird. It's also about a guy named Landon who falls in love with her later in the book. If you like love stories you'll like this book.I gave it three stars because I don't like love stories. It was ok sometimes and was usually boring for me.
4,Tim's Review,"I read ""A Walk to Remember"" for my supplementary novel. I thought this book was very good. Jamie Sullivan is a teenage girl, that is not in the ""in-crowd."" She is a very good student, who's father is a preacher, and her mother died when she was young. Landon Carter is the popular boy at school. Landon starts to fall in love with Jamie, even though Jamie's father didn't approve because he is very strict. This is a great book, because two people from completly different backgrounds fall in love. I definitely recomment this book, for anyone one looking for a quick read."
4,"Realistic, old-fashioned romance","I read this book in one night! It's pretty short (200+ pages, but they're small and the print is big). After seeing the movie, which was disapointing, I wanted to read the book. The book is way better, especially since it takes place in 1957. The movie's main problem was in trying to set a 50's book in a 90's setting without updating critical aspects. The book is sweet, but not overly so. I think it helps that it's told from Landon's point-of-view. Also, Jamie and Landon spend so much time together before there relationship finally changes. It creates great tension. There's also so much detail in the relationships in Landon's friends and family that's missing in the movie. It makes the book much richer. Overall, it has several important messages and tells a touching and real story."
5,A Walk In The Woods,"When I read Nicholas Sparks books,(and I have read them all,I know from the getgo they are not heavy reading material and that is just what Ilike. They take you into the characters and you feel with them. This book was a real tear jerker,a two box of tissues book. Good work again Nicholas Sparks"
5,a muz-read for every one!,"This is the book for you all! You'll never be disappointed ,trust me. I cried when reading the book and felt kinda refreshing after finishing it. It's truly a great book ,freinds. I've introduced it to my freinds and every one of them like it. One of them even rated it as her favourite book! So go and find out for yourselves about this sweet, touching, lovely expressed and pure love story now!"
3,Disappointing,"I usually love to read Nicholas Sparks books, but this one was really disappointing. I can't believe it myself, but the movie was better than the book.."
2,Very predictable,"I only read this book because I received it as a gift and I love to read. I found the story slightly touching but very predictable. Nothing came as a surprise to me. It was completely unrealistic and was actually a little too heartwarming at times. I know now why I choose not to read romance stories. Sorry Mr. Sparks, you've found no fan here."
1,Unexpectedly disappointed....,"Having read The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, I was expecting Sparks to deliver another novel that would be equally captivating in storyline. A Walk to Remember was a big disappoint for me, in the sense that it ended so abruptly. The opening of the story was intriguing, but the last 30 pages seemed like an attempt to just quickly end the story. For that reason, it has left a taste of disappointment in my mouth....."
2,WALK NOT MEMORABLE,"AFTER READING MR. SPARKS 2 PREVIOUS BOOKS , I WAS ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE DELIVERY OF "" A WALK TO REMEMBER"" WHICH I ORDERED SOLELY ON THE MERITS OF HIS FIRST TWO BOOKS. SADLY, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. ""A WALK...."" IS SAPPY, PREDICTABLE AND SUITED MORE TO THE PRETEEN READER. NEVER AGAIN WILL I RUSH TO AN AUTHOR'S NEW WORK SO BLINDLY."
3,"sentimental, predictable story","I must be jaded because I found this to be overly-sentimental and insipid. It was predictable from the word ""doctor""."
5,A true love story!,Most people never experience the kind of love that last forever. This book leaves you knowing that even death can't stop true love. Nicholas Sparks gets better with each book. I can't wait for his next.
5,Very memorable,"""A Walk to Remember"" by Nicholas Sparks is one of my favourite books of all time. This book has brought to me both tears and laughter, and the plot is so hooking and addicting that readers aren't going to be able to put it down; I ended up finishing the entire book in one day. Sparks really knows how to tug at a readers heartstrings in this moving story about young, everlasting love.The main characters, Jamie and Landon, takes us all on a spiritual journey, and along the way, teaches us about love, compassion, and faith.If any of you haven't read this book and are considering if you should, take my advice and READ it. You wont be dissapointed, particulary if you are someone that loves romantic and sweet stories, then this book is a must-read, you'll certainly enjoy it.And a little friendly advice, keep a box of tissues nearby; tears WILL come."
4,a great romance,"""A Walk To Remember"", though written only a few years ago, is already a classic romance novel. It's the best one I've ever read probably. I can't believe it's written by a man!! Wow. I think that any girl or woman over the age of about 12 will absolutely adore it. Boys and men probably won't, but I don't know, some might. And it's not nasty at all, like many books written lately, it's just a nice book that younger people can enjoy as well as older teens and adults. If you're any fan of romance or of Nicholas Sparks, or just loved the movie, then this book is for you!"
3,Sorry It Ended,I would have liked to find out what Landon did with the rest of his life. Did he become a minister or perhaps a doctor? Did he never marry and have children. I was a little baffled by the last paragraph.
5,Have not read yet.,"I haven't gotten the chance to read it yet, but I am hoping to get a chance to open the book. I am glad that Mr.Sparks has written another book. And I am sure that it is as splended as the other books he has written. I am extremely captivated in his passion for love and understanding. I am hoping that one day I can say this to him in person. I don't know how I am going to exactly feel but I know for sure it will warm my heart as the other two did. I recommend this book to everyone especially the men because they need to open up. Open up to what they have in their hearts. I am hoping the person I am waiting for does the same for me. Thank you"
4,"Love - romantic, familial, and spritual.","This is the first Nicholas Spark's book I have ever read so I don't know how it compares to his others. However, I did truly enjoy it. It made me think, feel, and remember what I all too often take for granted. It spoke of love - parental love, friendship, romantic love, and spirituality. My only disappointment was that the author might have better demonstrated Landon's love unfolding. It seemed to just spring upon you. Overall, though, he made me laugh and cry. It was an enjoyable opportunity that inspired me to appreciate life, love, and spirituality. For that I am grateful."
4,Sparks produces another tear-jerker,"He's done it again. This one is much shorter than his previous two novels but nonetheless just as effective in his emotion-wrenching style. It took one sitting to read this, always wondering where he's going with it. The ending will surprise you and go directly to the heart of your emotions."
5,A heart-warming book that changed my perception of youth,"After reading this book, I felt so moved that I wanted to go to the local high school and share it with the ""not so in-crowd."" It was poignant and heart-warming. A book that can be read quickly, but that you will want to read again and again. I think what I liked about it most, was the change in the Landon, and how Jaime helped him discover a part of himself that he never knew. A part of him, that probably in the end, kept him alive for these 57 years."
2,How frustrating,"I loved The Notebook and cried over Message in a Bottle and was so looking forward to this latest novel. I read it in three hours because I kept waiting for the knockout twists of fate and remarkably crafted endings that I'd come to respect and expect from Mr. Sparks. Instead, the entire book was predictable and artificial, perhaps written in a rush, and a disappointing Sunday read. And the whole book written in a 17-year-old's voice was, well, a nice try, but weak and annoying. I hope this was a bump in the road and not a preview of what's to come."
1,Mawkish drivel should appeal to the sentimental set......,"First off, I am a man, so I'm sure my review will change no one's mind. Manipulative, silly, unintentionally hilarious junk is a shining example of why literature has been abandoned in favor of Oprah-ized delirium which seeks only to ""heal"" and reinforce the undue importance of marginalized peoples. Yuck!"
5,This book talks of life and makes you feel the emotions.,"A Walk To Remember is a book I will not soon forget. It told of the way life really is. It had real situations that made you feel as of you were really there. As I read the book I laughed , I smiled, and I cried. This was the first book I've read by Sparks and now I'm eager to read more. This is also the first book that has ever made me feel emotions this real."
5,Completely Unforgettable! The Meaning of True Love,"I don't remember when I have been so emotional over a book. Movies, maybe, but not books. Eventhough this was one of the sadest books I have ever and probably will ever read, I will also keep a copy. The story of the high school couple is so unbelievably sweet and touching. Once you begin reading the book you just have to know what happens. I could not, no matter how hard I tried, put the book down to finish later. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what true love is and/or to anyone who just needs a good cry."
4,a book to remember,"Jamie was the daughter of a Baptist minister and Landon was the son of a Congressman. They came from two total different sides of town, and two totally different families but something happened their senior year that made all the difference. This is the story of their senior year, and it is told by Landon as an older man. He reflects on his senior year as the one that changed him, but all for the better. This book has been made into a motion picture which will be released to theaters on January 25th and is honestly, one of the best books I've ever read. It's truly, a book to remember."
4,So Predictable but Still Good,"This is not ""Message in a Bottle,"" but I still found this a good read. Not lengthy, a simple love story as seen thru the eyes of a 17-year-old boy. Makes you laugh, makes you cry. What more could you ask for?"
5,An unexpectedly amazing book,"I saw a preview for the movie ""A Walk To Remeber"" and thought it was interesting, so I decieded to pick up the book and read it before I can watch it. From the first few pages, I was drawn into story. Little did I know that I would stay up past midnight to finish reading the book because I couldn't put it down. I know it's a cliche, but I had to read it all the way through. I couldn't wait till the next day. I loved the sincerity of the main character, Landon, and how he goes through a transformation. It is a story about faith and love, and this one not only brought tears to my eyes, but made me re-evaluate how I live my life."
4,Good but not the best,"This book was incredibly touching but unrealistic, to me at least. The book was definitely better than the movie."
2,why all the buzz?,"I'm really not sure what all the buzz is over this story. I read it with high expectations, thinking it will be a very powerful and moving story. What I got was a predictable story line and no deep character development.I was hoping for my heart strings to be pulled and tears to pour out, but instead I just put the book down and went to cook my dinner without so mcuh as thinking about the story.There is nothing unique about this story, there are countless other stories like this but somehow with stronger character development where they will linger and stay with you long after you put the book down. As it is, my sentiment is more along the lines of ""Jamie who?"""
4,Joyous and sad,"I had already seen the movie when I read the book, so I knew the story in it self. It is very well written and captivating. A good read I ""swollowed"" very fast."
3,"Teary, teary = decent good.","This book made me a little teary as in how the characters are. Oh man, can you get a little teary after being a little emotional. N.Sparks is known for having characters passed away. I guess his characters could kind of relate to people in real life. He adds a little blooming romance and then some dramatic conflicts where it can't all be a happy ending. If you read it, you'll know what I mean. His writing is so so, but still a Hallmark-y feel and many might enjoy."
4,A Teen's Point of View.,"I am a 13 year old girl and I don't usually read those gushy romance novels but after a friend recommended this one to me I couldn't put it down. Nicholas Sparks has such a way with his words. This novel is so touching. Landon and Jamie's love story has such meaning. But it was quite predictable. It did break my heart when when Jamie told Landon she was dying. phh, who wouldn't be sad at that part. I decided to watch the movie and it certainly wasn't as great as the novel. Mandy Moore and Shane West could have done a better acting job. The book and the autor deserves that much. I have got to admit though, the ending was unexpecting. I won't spoil it for you but it's pretty sweet and sappy. I would recommend the book and the movie to anyne who likes this type of book. Sooo.... knock yourself out. I know I enjoyed it."
4,Another great read by Nicholas Sparks,"I have always been a fan of Nicholas Sparks' work, and this one is no different. Some people might not think it's a realistic story, but I don't agree. I think that the power of someone just being a genuine, nice, person who radiates kindness, etc really can affect someone else, even if it doesn't show at first.I watched the movie too, and I can't say I like either one better than the other, but Nicholas definitely does a good job telling a story that doesn't always have a happy ending, and yet doesn't make you feel completely depressed and unhappy that you read the book.If you are a fan of his previous books (or any after this one), I'm sure that you'll find this one enjoyable as well"
5,amazing. absolutely beautiful.,"Oh my. This book is by far the best book I have ever read. So much emotion went through my body when I read this. I cried, laughed, smiled, got angry. I was so amazed. I read the book 12 times! I fell in love with Landon and Jamie. They were so real. I felt like I knew them in person. I couldn't put the book down! I highly recommend it. <3"
4,Great love story but it's just OK for me,"The book was beautiful. I love how Landon felt for Jaime. He truly loved her. The book wasn't long and that's probably a good thing. Overall I thought the book was just ok. I probably would've gave it 3 stars but I gave it 4 stars because I loved loved the movie and found it to be much better. The book is very similar to the movie with some differences but I just really found the book not as good as the movie and that's rare. Usually books are much better than movies. However, if you loved the movie like me than I would still suggest you read the book."
2,A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks,"While the book was new and hardbound as requested, it was not a full sized book. It also did not have a cover. I ordered two other Nicholas Sparks books at the same time and they were exactly as I expected and ordered."
5,Completely Captivating,"This book had me from the beginning. I was unable to put it down and finished it in the same day. I thought it was one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. It was sweet and sincere, I laughed and I cried. I must say though the ending left me wanting to ask the question, ""did she or didn't she""? I was reading the last page to everyone in my house looking for opinions. Thanks for a great book Mr. Sparks, I can't wait for the next book!"
1,"Nick, where has your charm gone???","I am a sucker for good romantic stories - however, A Walk to Remember is a disappointing third book by Sparks. The characters are shallow and the story is so predictable (if you have read the first two Sparks' novels). The lines are repeated time and time again to bring out the readers' emotions and none of the sentiments touched me deeply ... I'm sorry to say that the book was written to popularize tissue papers. Sparks tried to please the readers too much that he lost the charm that he had so deeply in ""The Notebook"". Please Nicholas, bring back your charm from ""The Notebook"" and stop trying to please the readers ... The Notebook is the best of his novels so far."
1,made me ashamed that I had actually read it,"I read this book. When I first picked it up, I honestly thought that I had mistakenly purchased a copy for those readers who are visually impaired! The type was so large and the margins on the page were huge! As I contined to read, I realized why: Nicholas Sparks has nothing to say. He is riding the wave of the Bridges of Madison County, ""romance lite"" books -- those kind of small, shallow books that is taking advantage of American readership these days. He knows our attention spans aren't what they used to be, that we're not really that bright and certainly don't like to be challenged intellectually, so he is laughing at us all the way to his bank while publishing this fiction that passes off for books. This was the most revolting, insulting book I have ever read, and actually made me ashamed that I invested the time and money to read it."
2,Inconsistent,"I almost put this book down after the Prologue. It was poorly written, overwrought at times, and it failed to evoke the emotions Spark was trying to evoke.When I got to the meat of the story, I was wondering who had written the Prologue. Spark has a warm, conversational tone in the book that draws the reader in. The story and the characters are interesting, and you grow to care about what happens.When he's not trying to evoke an emotion, Sparks is much more effective. When he's attempting to manipulate the readers' emotions, he fails. The ideas and images are trite and hackneyed. Sparks should let the emotion speak for itself."
1,Don't waste your time,"This will be the last Nicholas Sparks I read. I am tired of sappy, predictable stories with no literary value. Please, Mr. Sparks, get some different story lines........instead of simply changing names, locations, etc."
3,Where's the Spark?,"After reading the authors earlier works, I have to say I was some what disappointed with his latest effort. Don't get me wrong, Mr Sparks is a fantastic author and his books are great but this novel lacked the emotion and detail of The Notebook and Message In A Bottle.... Read if you must but don't expect the same reaction of the other two."
5,Great book!,"!!!I highly recommend this book. I dont even read alot and this book was easy, fun and sweet. Definitely worth reading!"
3,Not all its cracked up to be,"Nicholas Sparks' A Walk to Remember was not the fantastic book I had anticipated it would be. I would rate it a 3 out of 5. Having been a best seller, I expected a bit more from the novel. As far as literary merit goes, I saw none. Sparks' writing lacks use of any symbolism or motifs and contains poor excuses for what were intended to be examples of foreshadowing. His characters are undeveloped and his plot, predictable. I suppose I should have considered my distaste of the dullness of the movie Message in a Bottle before purchasing A Walk to Remember. On a better note, I will hand it to Sparks for creating a refreshingly moral demonstration of teenage life; a rarity these days. His wholesome humor and drama are sure to please someone but as far as I am concerned, I'll stick to looking for something deeper in 200 pages."
4,A Walk to Remember,"This was a tenderhearted book. I have not read much of this author's work but I did really enjoy this. It's easy to know where the story is headed, which in this case made me want to keep reading because of the sweetness of the writing. There are lessons to be learned from this, such as that things are not always what they seem, imagine yourself in the other person's shoes, don't jump to judge people. The book was well worth reading."
1,A Walk to Remember,"This is such a horrible book from Nicholas Sparks. I very much enjoyed The Notebook and Message in a Bottle. However, this book is EXTREMELY predictable and you almost hate the main character. It is almost as if Nicholas Sparks ripped off a sad yet very predictable Leave it to Beaver Christmas Special. A Walk to Remember is very forgettable."
1,"Oh Please, What Foolish Pablum","I didn't laugh, I didn't cry - I found it totally predictable. This is probably a great book for teenagers or young adults. Those who haven't read much or are just starting to forge adult relationships might find meaningful."
1,What a waste of time....,"This book was a complete waste of my good time. I would have awarded it no stars if that was possible. I read it because it was the book chosen by a member of our local book club. I thought it was brainless and simplistic.I had read The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, and while they did nothing to elevate my mind they were nice little stories. This one just made me mad that I paid good money for such a predictable story.I will never buy another one of Nicholas Sparks books again. Fool me once, but never again."
1,terrable,this was the worst book i have ever read i usuaily love tis guys books butt this 1 was a real dissapointment the moive was incredible every time i watch it i cry but the book didnt do ne thing 4 my emotions it was terrable idk wat this guy was thinkin when hewrote this
5,A Fabulous Book,"Sparks sure was sure right about this book. It made me laugh and cry. Although i did see the movie first, the book was even better. A great read for young teens who dont appreciate what they have in life!"
4,quite interesting lovestory,"I`m a German student of the 11th grade, and I`ve read this novel in class.I found it easy to understand, and although I usually don`t read lovestories, this one was quite interesting to me. The way Nicholas Sparks writes about the actions and thoughts of Landon and Jamie (the main characters), makes it really easy to share their emotions."
5,What a wonderfully touching story!,"This is a charming, well-written story of a young man and the evolution of his perspective. I laughed, I got a little teary,I loved it. Very sweet!"
5,My Favorite Book,"This book is my favorite book of all time. It's heartwarming, sweet, and of course, very emotional. Most people who see the trailer for the movie will be like, ewww, it Mandy Moore or that looks really good! Well either way read this book! It will make you smile and cry and make you want to change your life. If your totally into love stories, don't pass this by! And, if your not into love stories, still read it! I am going to see the movie the day it comes out. The only thing I wish now is that I was more like Jamie and that somebody will love me as much as Landon did for Jamie. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"
5,A beautiful novel,"'A Walk To Remember' is a beautifully written novel. The story line evloves around the love of two teenagers and it shows that love can strike at any age. What makes this novel so good is the charatcher building and how they share their love for each other.There are parts in this novel that make it a romance classic, and this is a MUST read novel if you are a romantic type of person like me.There are parts in this novel that made me cry, and also it made me happy to see that these two people found love, and also it teaches how you can lose that love but still you change as a person inside and out.GREAT NOVEL."
1,"Could've, Should've...","been good. Instead it was a big disappointment. I cried til my eyes swelled after reading Notebook and Message...not a single tear was shed for this one. It's a sad story but it just didn't do it for me. I agree with the readers who said it's good for a teenager, not for a mature reader. Everything was so one-dimensional, there was nothing there. Maybe if Jamie and Landon's relationship developed faster we would've been more drawn in but in the end it was sad but I didn't really care."
2,Motherless daughter reviews Mr. Sparks latest,"I've read all three of Sparks' bestsellers. I loved THE NOTEBOOK and purchased several copies to share with my friends as gifts. Like Jamie Sullivan, I was raised by my father. My mother died in 1959 when I was five years old. A lesson I learned from Dad was the old ""if you can't say something good about something, don't say anything as all."" Therefore, I end my review right here!"
3,"ok walk, but not nearly as good as author's other two books","was a ""nice"" book, but i liked the author's other books better--perhaps because of the subject matter . . . reading about high school students just didn't have that much appeal to me . . . very quick book to read."
3,Not quite up to par with his other two best-sellers.,"While not quite up to par with ""The Notebook"" and ""Message in Bottle"", this book is an enjoyable, quick read. The lead male character is refreshingly honest and real, but I found the storyline to be a bit unrealistic and sappy. The end seems rushed and abrupt, which left me wondering ""what happened next?"" I would recommend this book if you like Nicholas Sparks' other titles, but don't expect it to be quite as good. The ""Notebook"", in my opinion, was one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read."
3,A walk to remember,this book was a very good and very well written. I enjoyed it. I would recommend it. Very enjoyable and entertaining!
5,AMAZING,"I've read this book 5+ times and I've seen the movie 4 times.. and yes, I cried every single time (both in the book and movie).. there's not enough words to explain how magnificent they are...SO amazing!!"
5,Absolutely Amazing!,I don't read books like this often. I am more of a Stephen King or James Patterson type of reader. I try once and awhile to stray from my normal paths of reading into things more sentimental. This was one of those times when I said let's read a sad book. This was one of the better books I have ever read. Landon Carter is a well developed and funny character. I like Sparks twists of humor and sadness all on one page. He makes you love the characters and actually makes you wish the book could go on and on. So I heavily recommend reading this book. I also think that every teenager should read this. It really makes you think.
1,Too sappy for words!,"I read this, against my better judgment, because of the setting. WHLE I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the book, it degenerated quickly into typical maudlin Nicholas Sparks during the second half which I did finish by reading only topic sentences."
4,Decent,"A very good romance. Lots of literary elements were implemented. Possibly better for a younger audience, however. Overall a good and quick read."
2,"Not worth my time, but maybe a 15 year old female's.","Not for adults, a good adolescent's book. Predictable. I was disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"Having read all of Nicholas Sparks' books, I was excited to read A Walk To Remember. I was very disappointed in the predictability and language used in this book. I agree with some of the other reviewers when they say they were sick of Landon saying, ""if you know what I mean."" The plot was just ok; very cliche. This wasn't typical of the writing of Sparks--it was more ""basic."" What I like about his books are the surprises. A Walk To Remember lacked that element of surprise, and that's the main reason for my low rating. Another reason for the 2 stars is that I have high expectations of Nicholas Sparks' books. This one was a disappointment."
2,A Walk not worth remembering....,"To my disappointment, ""A Walk to Remember"" left me puzzled on how a writer gifted enough to pen ""The Notebook"" could turn out such a mediocre novel. This story is slow, predictable and lacks the creativity and story telling worthy of a best selling author. There is little to no character development and plot suspense. ""A Walk to Remember"" demonstrates a writer producing a novel which can easily adapted to the Silver Screen. No need to read this book... just wait for the movie."
3,Torn between liking it and being ashamed that I liked it!!!,"I'll admit that this book made me cry and Sparks succeeded in bringing Landon and Jamie's characters to life. It was, however, incredibly predictable and overly mushy. Even the supposedly unusual ending was obvious. I gave it 3 stars because it was well-written and evoked emotion, but it was kind of cliched and not really very exciting to read. It's a good book to read in the winter when you're sitting by the fire and have an hour or two to spare, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over the age of 25. Also, it's definitely not a book that a guy would enjoy."
2,A walk I hope I forget!,This was my second attempt at a Nicholas Sparks novel. I really went into this one with an open mind after I completely detested the Notebook. Unfortunately this one was not any better. The dialogue is so unrealistic...people don't talk like that. There is nothing for descriptions and the story line is so predictable. Maybe Sparks is good for some people but his style is definately not something I enjoy reading.
1,Nothing but a Glorified Harlequin Romance,"This, as all of Sparks' books, are just romantic, predictable, sappy drivel. By page 5, most readers know exactly where this is going. There's much better stuff out there to be reading than this, folks."
1,Please!,"Please, when you are writing a review for a books, do not give the story away! People who are reading the reviews are trying to decide if they'd like to purchase and read the book. Please be careful!"
1,Freshman English,I bought this book on the strength of his earlier work. The story is totally predictable from page 40 onward. Characters are one dimensional. Not worth the time and effort. If you have the instincts to determine if its raining when your shoes are wet then you can figure out this story in about 15 minutes. It is simplistic drivel .
1,Pablum for the Soul,"Perhaps I'm too jaded, too stupid or too old to enjoy this novel, or perhaps this novel is vacuous, insipid, formulaic and fatuous. DOES THE LARGE PRINT REALLY FOOL THE READER THAT THIS IS A NOVEL AND NOT GENERIC, DIME-STORE FICTION? I'm sorry, but I will never read another novel by this author since he apparently has no compunctions about churning out this drivel, one after the other, while glaringly omitting meaning, purpose, originality, intellectual challenge, fire or inspiration. Perhaps I am mistaken and this work is specifically intended for the very young, for those learning English as a second language, or for the mentally infirm. ""Pop"" fiction."
2,Predictable,"I was very disappointed in this book considering how much I liked Sparks' A Message in a Bottle and The Notebook. The characters in A Walk to Remember were one dimensional. He didn't explore how his characters became the people they were. We assumed the minister was the way he was because his wife died in childbirth; but how did that affect how he raised his child, etc. Jamie's character is so flawed, uninteresting, and apparently soooooooooo nice that it's grating. I got through the book because I bet myself that Jamie's character would not be well (though it would have been interesting to see how far this kind of relationship would have gone). Definitely, not one of Sparks' best."
1,A Walk to Remember,"Preachy and predictable. This book is very religious and sends an over-simplified message of right and wrong. It separates the world into the righteous, religious types and the `sinner' who see the light as soon as they give the ""believers"" a chance to reach to them. This is the type of message you take your kids to church for. They deserve better in literature."
5,"So what if it's a ""chick book""?","After hearing about the movie, i talked with a few friends and decided to read the book before watching the movie. Keeping an open mind as to the nature of the story, I wasn't sure what to expect because the story was labeled as a ""chick book."" After reading the first chapter, i couldn't put it down. The story was great, and i enjoyed Nicholas Sparks' humor inserted all throughout the novel. A great read, funny, sentimental, and dramatic all rolled into one. I recommend it without reserve."
3,"Good book, movie is better.","This is a good, sweet book. However, after I saw the movie I liked it so much better than the book."
1,"""A WALK TO FORGET""","I was VERY disappointed in reading this book. It meandered for the entire 224 pages. Very simplistic and a third-grader could have written a better book.I can't believe all of the positive reviews. People must really be hard up for a love story. This is sophomoric at best. When the name of the author is larger than the name of the title---WATCH OUT!!It was a waste of my time. He could have summed the entire book up in one paragraph. What a pity!! Time is so valuable and I had to waste it on this ersatz piece of ""literature""."
3,nothing special,"Okay, if you like cheesy romantic fiction, you might like this. In fact, I like romance myself, but nevertheless, I found this to be an pretty mundane novel. The characters are one-dimensional, and the plot is predictable. When I was reading it, I found myself apathetic towards the sob-story aspect, because I saw it coming and wasn't interested enough in the cookie-cutter characters to care. While I'm sure it made great fodder for a teen movie, it just doesn't cut it as a good novel."
2,Terribly disappointed,"After reading Mr. Sparks' last two novels, I anxiously awaited this new arrival. I found it very disappointing. When the narrator tells you in the first few pages..that you <the reader> will laugh then cry....I did neither of these. The whole novel sounded like a college entrance essay...""How I Spent My Senior Year"" or ""What Event Changed My Life"" both of which..makes very boring reading. Im hoping Kevin Costner doesnt pick this book up and decide to make a Movie of the Week out of it."
5,A walk to remember holds my heart!,"In this book so much attention is paid to the details of Jamie and Landon's relationship unlike in the movie. I especially like the christmas at the orphanage part it shows so much more depth than any part of the movie. The book covers religion, love, school, parents, embarassment, charity, and its very intertaining. I have read this book at least 70 times before, and It makes me cry every single time.I reccommend this book to anyone who loves a good love story."
1,A Walk to Remember,"This book was a terrible letdown to me after reading the first two books by Nicholas Sparks, The Notebook was one of the best books I have read in many years, Message in a Bottle was also excellent as was the movie, I hope that if Sparks writes any more books they are up to the excellence of his first two! I recommend reading his first novels and saving your time and money by not reading his last one."
3,Slightly Disappointing,"After reading other books by Sparks you would expect more from this. Though it was not awful it certainly could have been better. In his other books you can get yourself convinced of the possiblity of them actually happening. This one is a little beyond realistic, even in my ultra-romantic mind. It is, however, quick and easy, so I'd take it to the beach if you can find nothing else."
3,Not one of Nicholas' Best,"I recently finished reading a walk to remember but didn't enjoy it nearly as much as his other books. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it was written from the man's point of view for a change, but it just didn't capture my attention and desire to keep reading as his other books did."
3,my book,the book that i got the cover wasnt the same as the picture. but was in good condition. but a good choice
4,It makes you smile and sob at the same time,Very well written. Nick never fails to succeed when it comes to giving the characters real emotions. I <3 it
2,SHOCKED AT ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR THIS BOOK .....,"I bought this book with the expectation of it matching the emotional ups and downs, ins and outs of ""The Notebook"" (an incredible love story that pulls at the heartstrings ... love this book so much!!) ..... IT DIDN'T ...... IT DIDN'T EVEN COME CLOSE .... I didn't get teary eyed a single time!! Its not a ""bad"" story, and yes, it offers insight to the wisdom of ""doing good"", but it sure didn't live up to its covers promises. I ended the book feeling like I just read a book my 10 year niece would enjoy. I am left wondering if I should try ""Message in a Bottle"" .... perhaps from the library ....."
1,"Don""t Bother",I think this book could have been written by any high school girl. Boring and predictable. Someone should tell him that a happy ending once in a while isn't a bad thing.
2,Few Sparks,"I read The Notebook several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I found it to be a touching story of long love. Though A Walk to Remember was an easy, quick read, it was less than believable. The characters were superficial and I found it depressing as well as unlikely that Landon would have spent the rest of his life alone. I'd be reluctant to read another of Mr. Sparks' books."
4,A Loving Walk,"If you loved Sparks' other books, you'll love this one, too. I thought that it started slower than his other books, but once it got going, I couldn't put it down. It's a touching story and it's a guaranteed cry :)"
1,Boring and Trite,"I had high hopes when I first bought this book that it would be a great read. Books are expensive in my country, costing me $30 a paperback. I regret buying this book. The characters of the book had no depth. The author seemed to rushed through everything. Being an avid reader, I can tell when an author's heart was not really there when writing the book. This is such a book. Even so, I forced myself to finish this book and almost laughed at how the author wrote ""almost want to cry"" so many times and how the characters were so boring. The only good thing I can say is that the first few pages were okay and that's even praising too much."
2,I am very jealous of Nicholas Sparks,"The man is building an empire -- presumably a very lucrative one -- by crafting a simple, winning formula. One that I could have crafted if only I'd thought of it before he did. The formula is so simple: write a weepy, excessively sentimental love story. That's it. That's all it takes. Who buys books? Mostly women. What do they buy? Weepy, sentimental... well, you get it.This book isn't even well written (as one reviewer has pointed out here, the first-person protagonist starts out telling his story in teenage-speak -- even though he's now a middle-aged man). But all Sparks had to do was create a character who was so smitten with the ethereal girl that he NEVER got over her -- never even considered getting married or even having a relationship of any kind with any other woman as long as he lived. Voila -- his target audience is hooked. Sparks gets richer. I get more jealous."
4,Reviewing A Walk to Remember,"I liked the book A Walk to Remember. I thought the characters and events in the book were very realistic. Jamie was my favorite character because she was very confident in herself, kind, had a positive outlook on life, she always did what she knew was right even if it wasn't what the ""popular"" kids would do, and she effected the lives of many people. I liked this book because it talks a lot about faith and how two totally different people went against the odds and fell in love. The thing I disliked most about this book was its ending."
1,My long wait was in vane.,"I had been waiting with bated breath for Mr. Sparks to write another book. After The Notebook and Message In a Bottle, my hopes for another great read, I thought, would be worth the wait. Not. I read it one sitting and found it to be very predictable and not funny or sad at all due to the pedictability. After his first two top notch books,I expected much more then he delivered."
2,Thumbs down for me,"This book certainly bombed for me. I very much enjoyed the author's earlier two titles, but found this most recent work trite and predictable, as well as overly syrupy and sweet. No twists. No ""moral."" Way too predictable. This is what you might see on a made-for-TV movie that lasts 90 minutes. Sorry, this one wasn't for me."
5,Romantic,this novel was one that i could not put down! Of course I am a die hard romantic as well so if you are one then this is a novel you must read!
4,Another great love story,"After reading The Notebook, Nicholas Sparks quickly became one of my favorite authors. His non-traditional love stories are truely uplifting to read. To make a point, I don't even like love stories. Sparks' books, however, are on a totally different level.This book is not quite as good as The Notebook but nevertheless more than worth reading. If you like a good heartwarming story, I would give my highest recommendation to any of Sparks' books."
3,heart warming,"I work in a book store and I read whenever I can. A Walk To Remember was my first book by Nicholas Spark and it definitely pulls all chords of the heart. A sentimental and romantic love story , this novel makes one remember, that there are so many lovely ways to consider life as a precious gift and to make every effort to make it truly beautiful. Though the story at times has certain resemblance to Eric Segal's ""Love Story"", it is different and unique in its own way. A must read for all those who believe in the power of love."
4,Very sweet book!,"I hadn't really intended on reading this until my best friend gave it to me for my birthday. I had seen the movie and liked it, but I was really blown away by the book.The story loses some of its teeneybopper movie elements in favor of a sweeping, romantic story that still retains younger generation appeal. I loved the descrpition of the Christmas play in here better than the one they did in the movie, and all in all, the book was better.I read it while listening to the ""Love Affair"" soundtrack in my headphones, and it really accentuated the romantic longing and feelings. I would recommend this book to anyone who liked the movie -- you will probably like the book even better!"
5,A Walk to Remember,"This is by far my favorite book! I LOVED it soooo much. I thought it was amazing story about your first love. That I think most everyone can relate to. If you are in Middle/High School you can relate to all the ""groups"" and images that everyone has of one another, but when opposites attract its a beautiful thing. If you are a bit older, most likely you know what it is to be in love for the first time. Of course, we all know what happens in the end...but still the memories and moments leading up to it were amazing. There were soo many scenes and moments where you are so caught up in the book, you DONT wanna let go! I recomend this book to everyone. Its such a moving and touching story. The last 50 pages will be done in one shot cause there is no physical way you can put the book down!"
3,Just watch the movie.,"I decided to read this book after having seen the movie, just for the heck of it, and while the book was good and I enjoyed seeing the story play out from Landon's perspective, I have to say the movie is better. The book has a heavy religious component to it, which definitely doesn't appeal to everyone (including myself) and tends to feel similar to how it feels when evangelical Christians shove God in your face to chastise you for something or show you that their way of life is better. Not to mention it was a little shallow how Landon turned from a regular teenaged boy who made fun of girls like Jamie, to a completely different person, because he fell in love with her the moment he saw her with MAKEUP on. In general I'd say that while the story is good, you might as well not waste your time on the book when you can just watch the movie."
1,A Walk to Forget,"I had such high hopes. Loved The Notebook, enjoyed The Last Song and was hoping for another Sparks home run. However, this was not meant to be. The beginning of the novella was intriguing but promptly fell flat. The emotional manipulation was way over the top and I felt a utterly cheated. Poorly done Sparks, poorly done."
4,A Walk to Remember,I have just started reading Nicholas Sparks books in the past couple of months and this one is just as intriging as most of his books. My problem is when I start one I do not want to put it down as I need to know what is going to happen. I will say addicting is what is was! Very Good.
5,Better than the movie,"I read this book right before the movie came out. The book is definitely much better than the movie, although I do love the movie. One of the best books I've ever read. And by far my favorite author."
3,Predictable ... But not that bad,"OK ... I am a man and not the biggest fan of romantic books. I've read the Notebook and did not mind it too much. Over the holidays I was visiting relatives and they were all reading this book. One evening, I picked it up.Now, from page 4, I knew what was going to happen with the relationship, but that was okay. Mr. Sparks is a master of creating situations where love is put to the absolute test. The true testament of this book is that I find myself thinking back to certain scenes from time to time (I won't ruin any for those who have not read the book).I don't think Mr. Sparks will ever win awards for his writing, but he knows how to punch you in the gut deep enough for the hurt to stay around long after the book is closed."
2,A Walk to Remember,"The first Nicholas Sparks book that I read was The Notebook. What a wonderful novel, which pulled me along and kept me reading right through to the end nonstop. Then came Message in a Bottle. I really enjoyed it, too. Not quite as much as the first book, but it definitely had its good points. Unfortunately, A Walk to Remember truly disappointed me. I don't know if it was the tacky setup in the prologue which told me that he was planning to manipulate my emotions right from the start or if it was just the story itself. I didn't laugh. I didn't cry. I believe Mr. Sparks does a much better job of telling a story when he is NOT doing it with the sole intent of emotional maneuvering. I read it and found myself thinking that my 12-year-old daughter might enjoy it when I finished it."
1,REVIEW RATINGS UNBELIEVEAB LE,"Three pages into this book, I found myself checking to see if it was age-specific for teenyboppers, or published years ago, before Sparks hit his stride in Time in a Bottle or The Notebook. The poor, amateurish writing was extremely disappointing. I did finish the book, first because it was just a few pages and I read it in a couple of hours, but secondly, to see if there were any surprises in the ending. Unfortunately there wasn't. I will be much more cautious in purchasing any of his future books."
3,Not His Best Work,"I was very disappointed after reading this new Nicholas Sparks book. (I cried all throughout his book The Notebook.) After such a big smash hit with The Notebook I thought that this book would bring about the same types of feelings (romance, true love, caring) that The Notebook did. Boy was I wrong....Don't get me wrong the last 20 pages or so were emotional, but the beginning of the book lacks direction and fails to grab the reader and pull you in....I am not giving up on Mr. Sparks yet since The Notebook is #1 on my favorites list, so let us just hope he takes longer to think the emotions and the characters through next time"
3,Good book,"This is a Nicholas Sparks book. I love his writing and have read many of his books. This is one that I could have passed on. My teenage granddaughter loved it and told me I had to read it. For her age, it is a good read. The author's best book is the one about him traveling with his brother around the world. It is non-fiction and the best he has done."
5,Great Novel About Teen-age Romance,"A Walk To Remember is the first novel written by Nicholas Sparks that I have read.And I am hungry for more of his works.After reading this,I borrowed his other works - The Notebook and Nights in Rodanthe - from the public library.The story in A Walk To Remember maybe simple and somewhat predictable BUT it was truly touching and heart-warming.The reader will obviously feel for the teen-age characters - Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan - for both the love that they have for each other and the pain they are about to experience after their feelings for each other have been fully developed.It will definitely be a must read for someone who loves a good romantic novel."
4,A walk to remember,"Made you smile and cry at the same time. Shows you the true meaning of love, forgiveness, kindness and miracles"
1,Definitely not as good as Notebook and Message,"I loved the two previous books by Sparks and could not wait for this book to come out. As I was on page 80, I was still waiting for the magic of the story to hit me as the other two stories did already reading page 2. It never came. It was a nice story, but not what I expected from a writer who wrote such beautiful stories as Notebook and Message. I am definitely disappointed. Please Nicolas, we need more romance, this was more like a nice children's story."
1,A Walk that's predictable.,"This is my first experience with a Sparks novel and likely to be my last. If after 20 pages you can't figure out where this book is going you're probably going to enjoy it. The time period of the fifties serves no real purpose and adds nothing to the story. (Sea bass and salad in a restaurant in the 50's, please!)The spirituality of love is no trifle but this book never convinces me that this callow youth has made such an incredible change. The prose reads like something that could be picked up the young adult section in the library. There was one saving grace however; it was short."
2,Not As Moving,"I'm guilty, I love Nicholas Sparks' books, particularly The Notebook. I don't believe this book to be one of his best.There isn't any real chemistry between the two and I began to feel that Landon was just some confused boy with a deadline to meet. The ending was endearing and leaves you with an unexpected glow but it was too little too late.Maybe I'm just growing cynical but this was certainly no book to be remembered. For a fool-proof all around winner of a romance buy The Notebook!"
5,Sweetest book ever,"this was the sweetest book i have ever read, be ready to laugh and cry. A walk to remember is a sweet love story with turmiol and heartache but i loved it"
5,"The Best Book I've Read, No doubt","This has to be the best book I've ever read! It's heart-warming, inspirational, a tear-jerker, and makes you look at love/life through a whole new perspective. It's about a young man who falls in love w/the most unlikely girl that he would ever date, Jamie, a preachers daughter, who is free-spirited and just a great person. This book showed a meaning that will stick w/ us forever- a lesson that needs to be learned, and through the book, you see these two people go through the experiance of life and loves unpredictable miracles."
1,The Movie WAS WAY Better. The book...disapointment!,"This story lacked passion. The ball was dropped big time and was very disappointed. The movie is based off this story, but the movie writer made many changes that were not in the book... I think for good reason. Watch the movie and pass on the book."
4,different cover,"Everything okay. It is clean, but the cover is different from the image online. I expected the same cover, but the cover that I received was a photo of movie characters, and I don't like it."
5,A walk to remember,"this was an exceptionally good book! this was the 1st book that i actually picked up and read by myself- w/out being forced to read a dumb book by my high school teachers! it was a very sad but happy book! esp. if u new sum1 that had cancer(Leukhemia) it would be harder to read since you new how much pain they went though! My best friends brother had Leukhemia when he was 3- and he was in so much pain while goin through the treatments. But, he has now been in remission for almost 6-7 yrs! it as just harder for me to read this book knowing people that have had cancer. but, again, it was a great book!"
1,He has NOT done it again..,"I love the first two books, but this one was awful. No depth of characters, poorly written, dull voice, and extremely predictable are a few of the reasons. It seems he was writing this in a big hurry - perhaps to get on the BS list again, or he wrote it while in the seventh grade. Yes, Mr. Sparks, you know how to write a moving story, a love story from a male perspective. You just didn't do it this time."
2,I was disappointed in this book.,"Mr. Sparks latest book is not the quality of Message in a Bottle or The Notebook. I did not laugh or cry...and found the book predictable, no surprises. At least A Prayer For Owen Meany had suspense."
4,This book was one of the best I've read yet.,"I've never read any of Nicolas Sparks books before, and wasn't to happy about having to read this one for a book report. But within no time I was drawn in by the witty character of Landon. Then with the love story that began to unfold, I found myself unable to put the book down. True, the story does have a sad ending, but it leaves you with a heart warming lessen in love and life that you will never forget. If I can give you one peace of advice, it would be to take the chance and read this book!"
5,A Walk To Remember,"This book hit home with me. It was funny, warm, heartbreaking, and tearful. As with all of Nicholas Sparks books I could not lay it down until I finished it."
5,A remarkable experience of reading!,I read this book in one day. I could not put it down. I thought the story was amazing. It made me want to be more like Jamie. She was such a generous person. Nicholas Sparks can make you have so many different emotions if you read this book. I reconmend this book to anyone who wants to hear a heart-touching story. You will not forget it. I can't wait for the movie!
5,A Book to Remember,"I am not someone who can say that I read a lot. I enjoy reading but rarely find a book that truly speaks to me. But I can honestly say that this book did just that. This is the best book I have ever read, and I have read several. I couldn't put it down. I read the entire book the day I bought it. It is well written, touching, riveting... I could go on and on. I recommend this book to all.. young and old. It speaks to the heart and you hear every word loud and clear. I love this book so much that I think I will read it again tomorrow!"
4,A book to reaffirm your belief in people,This was such a refreshing and uplifting read! I came away from this book thinking of all the things I could do for others. Jamie is such a memorable character and someone that all of us should strive to be more like! The love story is believable and endearingly innocent.
5,Wonderful Story,"I was born in the 70's, and this book was a great one. It will be on my shelf for a long time. How could one be disappointed after reading this? How shallow and heartless! Where is their sense of caring, giving and of course love? Life isn't etched in stone as we all know. One may need to read it again if disappointment was the feeling the first time. Think about your first love then maybe reality will set in...Mr. Sparks, keep up the good work. I am a loyal reader after this one!"
3,A good read of young love during a bygone era.,"A fast read, reasonably good but with little depth. Sweet, Funny, Sad, and Predictable come to mind to describe the story and most of the characters. What it does do, is allow the reader who lived during the 1950's to recollect what young love was about then as opposed to what it is perceived to be now. Clearly a reasonable value at the retail level, and a bargain thanks to the Internet."
1,So sweet it makes your teeth hurt,"This totally unrealistic coming of age love story was trite, poorly writen and lacking in character development. The plot was predictable. Within the first 30 pages, I had figured out the fate of all the major characters, and was absolutely on target. This is NOT a book for anyone who enjoys beautiful language, character development, in-depth psychology, or an intriging plot as all these elements are missing.It might be a suitable and safe book for a 12 - 14 year old - particularly a romantically inclined but unsophisticated young girl. Not worth the time for a mature reader."
1,I'm trying to be nice,"I am on page 214 and am reticent to move on to 240. What a bunch of bunk! Is Nicholas Sparks the male Danielle Steel of this century? To say it was predictable would be superfluous. Nick, have you ever read a well written book? OK I picked it up at Costco for a mere 3.79 and I have at least 600 books to my name, but never have I read anything so lame."
5,Fantastic!,I will not go into a review of the book. So many here have done that and done it well. I simply add my fullest and unreserved endorsement of this book and the author.
3,I wasn't won over,I read and heard how wonderful and emotional this book was. I bought it and read up to chapter 8. This book didn't move me. I became bored and frustrated with the story. I don't know what type of person you need to be to enjoy something like this...but it wasn't for me. The author is an excellant writer with a warm presence. Although this book bored me to death doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. If you want a sweet story with good morals and values then this is for you. I have to admit though this book is refreshing from all the mess that's written today.
5,A Must Read!!,This is a beautiful love story. I saw the movie first and was unsure that I wanted to read the book and have it ruin the movie for me. It seems more often than not the book is better. It wasn't and I now love them both. I would recommend this book for Jr. High students up to adults. There is no content unsuitable for the YA.
2,Sweet but predictable,"While I do love Nicholas Sparks writing, and yes even I was moved to tears (not easy to do) in this sweet story; I found A Walk to Remember predictable. If you a looking for a fast read and a cathartic cry this is the book for you. I found the protaganist to be placed on a pedestal so high that I could not relate even to the feelings the narrator has for her.Yes I cried, yes it was a quick read. I just expected more."
4,Sugary Sweet Fun,"To all of the critics out there, if you want Shakespeare, then read Shakespeare. But if you want to read a touching, fun, heartwarming tearjerker of a novel, then sit back, relax and let yourself get lost in A Walk to Remember. Nicholas Sparks may not be the most literary writer out there, but he touches a woman's heart the way D.M. Roman (the author of Fried Calamari) touches a woman's psyche. With Sparks, you know what you get, and A Walk to Remember does not disappoint."
5,Sparks didn't lie (btw don't listen to the other guy),"""First you will smile, and then you will cry -- dont' say you haven't been warned.""This book does exactly just that.You smile... even laugh sometimes.. and suddenly break into tears... and keep on crying... until the last line...A Walk to Remember makes you contemplate once again what it means to be a human, and what is importatant about being human. The plot maybe simple, but it well serves its purpose. Expect to finish this in a few sittings while saying ""not yet, don't end this yet"".The bottom line is: If you loved the Notebook, you'll love this one even more; if you didn't love the Notebook, you'll love this one..."
2,Remember to Forget this One,Nicholas Sparks' The Notebook was probably the best book I read last year. This book is a very pale imitation. The storytelling is enjoyable but by the end of the story you wonder what the whole point was. I felt that Landon would have done more with his life (like actually had one) if Jamie had actually had the impact on him that he claims throughout. The story is interesting and is one you can share with your children but not as deep as Sparks intended.
3,Maybe I'm Crazy...,"...but I kinda like the movie better, and it wasn't super great or anything. Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, but after seeing the movie, I expected something really fantastic (the book version is always supposed to be way better than the movie version, right?), and I didn't get that from it."
4,<3,This book was so good! I'm not a big crier when I read books but this one i almost did. So touching! I saw the middle and end of the movie and knew I had to get the book! In my opinion the movie might have been a little better because the book was a little slow moving. Other then that this book is a must read for anyone a teen or above. .....love Nicholas Sparks and this is one of my favorites. :)
5,To Charlie,"Charlie, He says that he never took off his wedding ring, because he never had the desire to. The miracle he prayed for was her survival. She lived!"
5,A Walk to Remember,"I think this novel shows Nicholas Sparks' versatility as a writer. The diction he chooses to use (that of a 17 year old boy) demonstrates his ability to change his style while still capturing the readers' minds and hearts. Some other reviewers thought that this ""new"" style came across as immature or childish, but I feel that it makes the story different from the rest of his works by mixing the innocence and youthfulness of a boy with the hindsight and wisdom of a grown man."
1,Waste of Time,"I cannot fathom why this book has so many entries with a ratingof five stars. There is no depth to either the charactersor the story, and it did not engage me. It brought meneither laughter nor tears. I've not read anything elseby this author, and I'm not likely to do so."
2,Not Like Sparks other books!,"I loved Message in a Bottle and The Notebook! A walk to Remember was well written, but it was easy to guess the ending by the 3rd chapter."
2,the one time the movie was better than the book..,"it was alrite but it got very boring as you got into it. it was too schmalzy and too focused on her sickness and the depressingness of the book.. towards the end all they do is read the bible together.. it gets just sooo stupid.the movie, however, was sweet. it moves faster and is just a nicer version of the story much less focused on religion and does not attempt constantly to make you cry to the point you want to rip it up.."
4,Needs More Detail,"""A Walk to Remember"" was an ok book. The story plot was good but i think it could have been more discriptive. The story was nice and i would recomend it if you like romantic books and you have a good imagination. Nicholas Sparks is a good writer but i think if this book had given more detail that the book would be much better. But over all the book was good."
5,Movie is Better than the Book,"Nicholas Sparks never disappoints me. I usually prefer Sparks books over the movies, but I was the opposite on this one. I would recommend either one to someone!"
4,Really good love story with a twist.,"Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author! I have a really hard time reading and comprehending 99% of authors and their books. But Nicholas Sparks books are very easy and most of all enjoyable to read! He is the only author that I've actually read the entire book from cover to cover. I can't put down his books, they are so good. I read them so fast that I then find myself waiting for him to write a new one because I've read all he has written so far. He can't write them fast enough for me. A walk to Remember is a record for me, I finished it within a week, reading only at bedtime on my I-pad.A Walk to Remember is a good love story with a twist. It ranks in at #3 (#1 was the notebook, #2 the wedding)"
5,"Fantastic, Beautifully Moving Love Story","This was my first Sparks book, and I enjoyed it so much I am looking to read them all. His writing style makes you ""see"" and ""feel"" the details of his story, and his tale takes you through the full gamut of emotions. The prologue of this book is important, and true to its word. A wonderful read for anyone who enjoys a good love story, and the meaning of real friendship!"
3,"Engaging, entertaining, even heart-wrenching, yet ...","Having read Message In a Bottle, The Notebook, and A Bend In The Road, I can honestly say this was my least favorite. I was caught up in the story and I couldn't stop reading until I was near the end of the book. I could feel the emotions of the characters and I responded to their achievements and to their tribulations with my own feelings. It was an excellent story until the end. To put it bluntly, I thought the ending was ""hokey."" It was anticlimatic. Still, it is entertaining and worth a quick read."
4,*mandaz review*,"A Walk to Remember was one of the better books I have read. Usually, I tend to get bored with books, but this one kept my interest. Although it started out somewhat slow, the middle of the book kept me wanting to read more and more.A Walk to Remember tells the story of how one unpopular and ""strange"" girl completely changes the life of one rebellious, ""cool"" boy. When the boy falls in love with the girl, his whole life is changed for the better, but the girl hides a secret. This one secret greatly changes both of their lives forever.I would recommend this book to those who like to read sweet love stories. You'll finish it within a matter of a couple days - trust me!"
5,One of the best books ever,This book is so wonderful! I saw the movie a couple times before reading the book and I really enjoyed it. And then a couple weeks ago at an airport I found the book and bought it right away. I had it finished two days later and it is simply one of the best books that I have ever read! Now I am very disappointed in the movie. I can't believe they had the nerve to make the movie but not even make it at all like the book. They are completely different and I would most definitely recommend the book over the movie anyday.
3,Feel-good again,"Fast,feel-good read. Nicholas Sparks has done it again. Same type book as his others. If you liked any of them, you'll like this one too. He has captured the essence of being young and wanting to fit in with the crowd, even at the expense of innocence. I liked the humor in this book, even though it was scarce. The ending? I know what I think the miracle was. Do you know? Making your own assumptions is what I think helps make this a unique book."
4,how can you say it's not great?,"after reading the reviews on this book, i felt i had to defend it. i started reading sparks when i read the NOTEBOOK, and this was the second sparks novel i read. the plots are great, sweet, and easy to follow. this book kind of left me hanging, and that made it a great read. i recommend it. i fully intend to read his other novel, message in a bottle, next."
1,No Question to the Ending,"I conducted a phone interview with Mr.Sparks some time ago, and he did say that the ending was meant to conclude that Jamie does die. Perhaps it wasnt conveyed to other readers as he meant.I did not like this book...it was way too shallow. I found it in the pages of my 5th grade sons book orders! Not for a mature adult."
1,Silliness at best!,"This is surely a drivel for pimpy girls without boy friends (but dreaming of Tom Cruise)and bored housewives with doughs in their laps, who long ago left analysing, thinking and making any intelligent decision. If you are below 15 years old or your mentality age is around that you can like this...and it is ghastly that this book received so many five stars and many people cried for it. I could have cried a little only for the blandness of the nation.Oh well-someone still makes bucks and laughs all the way to the bank."
2,I wasn't impressed,"I am surprised at how many people gave this book such good ratings. I found the story to be boring, trite and predictable. The girl in the story really is too good to be true. Christian or no, just not someone most people can relate to. As for the boy's character, I have to say, I enjoyed his character development although his change of heart happens a little too quickly and with little explanation as to why.The ending of the story was so predictable it's really insulting to the reader's intelligence. Check it out from the library if you want an exceedingly unchallenging, ""brain-candy"" type of read. I wouldn't buy it and definitely wouldn't see Hollywood's version either."
2,Yawn :o,Boring! There was no plot to this story and I knew what was going to happen but still I was expecting a lot more! All that happens is that they fall in love and she dies. Boo hoo. Why are you crying? It's just a bad book.
