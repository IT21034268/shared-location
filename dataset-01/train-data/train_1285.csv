4,Strawberry Shortcake Murder,Love this author-Keeps me guessing till the end-you get your money's worth out of her books-great receipes in each one-even they are well written-I am a big fan
4,Grab a Cuppa and a Cookie,"Much to her mothers chagrin Hannah seems to find herself once again right in the middle of a murder mystery.The ever popular owner of The Cookie Jar in Lake Eden, Minnesota, Hannah is asked to serve as a judge in a dessert baking contest, unfortunately one of her fellow judges is found dead with one of Hannah's Strawberry Shortcakes so of course she feels that she should at least try and find out who did it.Hannah's sense of justice prevents her from letting Boyd's abused wife take the fall -- even though Boyd is a man that deserves to be dead--so with the help of a returning cast of quirky characters that make Lake Eden a very interesting place to live, Hannah leads the readers on a tour of Lake Eden, and its inhabitants, but first she needs a cup of coffee and chocolate."
5,Great Reading!,"I am so excited that I found this series! Joanne is a great writer and I have really enjoyed her wit and her recipes. The characters are and their interactions are believeable and enjoyable. I wish we could take a weekend jaunt to Lake Eden. This book was just as good as the first one!As a teacher, I know my peers will enjoy sampling the recipes listed in her books."
4,A Yummy Little Mystery!,This is such a cute and fun mystery series and the recipes sound really yummy as well. This is the second book in the Hannah Swenson series following Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder which was also a wonderful read.
4,Shaping up to be a nice series,"Book two of the series, and it's as good as the first - maybe even a little better. The character development is as good as before, and the mystery is a little more well-constructed. Hannah's person life and the relationships with those around her are portrayed well, giving you a real sense of the setting and personalities involved in this small, sleepy tourist town."
4,bluebird,Good read. Not the great American novel but very entertaining and enjoyable. The whole series had helped me through many hours spent in my husband's hospital room.
4,Another Great Hannah Swensen Mystery,"This is the second book in the Hanna Swensen series by Joanne Fluke.Hannah is back and trying to solve the murder of Boyd Watson, along with the help of her sister, Andrea. As Hannah digs deep she uncovers lots of secrets about the citizens of Lake Eden.I quite liked this mystery, even though I solved the mystery before Hannah. I like the close relationship Hannah is starting to have with her sister, especially as they were never close growing up. It's nice to see them trying to solve the murder together.This is a fun series and I will likely continue on with this series."
4,Adorable Series,This was a wonderful second addition to the series. They are always so cozy that all you want to do on a Saturday is curl up on the couch with it and a cup of tea.
4,"Extremely well shot, imaginative","Great to watch with some nice surprises. Makes you wonder why Dean Cain hasn't done more as he's very capable of carrying a film as a leading man. I'm picky about my horror, whether low or big budget...this one has some originality, which is so rare in film these days."
2,Maneater,DVD is of very poor quality. Many scenes are too dark to view in spite of my new flatscreen and DVD player
1,Beware,"I have a Epson C82 printer. So far I spent 5 hours trying to get the program to print correctly. Tech support slight help, but still not able to print. Good Luck if you try it. Bob"
3,caution,The software was easy to install and I was able to create great layouts. The problem came when I tried to print using my HP printer. The settings are not compatible with the storybook layout. I would be VERY cautions about getting this product if you don't have an Epson printer.
2,"Nice idea, but nightmare to print","I love the idea of this product, and I loved working with it. I created a great layout that looked fabulous on screen. But unless you have an Epson printer, it is very difficult to print out a great copy. My hp deskjet could not handle the supplied photo paper, so a friend printed on his Lexmark for me. It worked better, but still had a few problems. More paper should be included in the package in case of printing problems because after several printing problems, we ran out of paper and I could not find the same photo paper in any store; I ended up buying a second package just to get more of the same paper.Next time, I will make a book using the ofoto site -- much more professional looking (2-sided) and just as cheap."
1,This product sucks monkey balls,"Even though the cost is only $9.95, it's not even worth that. There are no installation instructions with the hardware, nor is there even a brand name to go look up information. Though the packaging saids that it's Microsoft compatible, the software is not microsoft test verified. In my case it would work okay for a (very) little while, then my computer to would cease to recognize it, and I'd have to remove the software and hardware (in the device manager), restart the computer and reinstall everything from the beginning. Worse yet, after discovering that the product was made by a company called Huge Pine, their site offers no assistance whatsoever (or even mentions that they have this product).Spend a little more money and save yourself the aggrivation."
1,Does not work. Driver cd would not load,This product is a complete waste of time and money. The driver cd will not load. Do not buy this product.
3,This product is junk - but not after finding the right driver...,"I wish I had read the other reviews before ordering. They just threw the cable and CD into an envelope with no other packaging so the CD was smashed when it arrived. No documentation and apparently no place to get drivers for VISTA. The only thing useful is the DB9 to DB25 adapter.[...]Download the .rar file, extract it, run the ""autorun.exe"", select your cable and platform, it also includes the documentation in pdf. Worked great first time on Vista."
4,The New And Impoved Akwid?,I usually rate My Favorite artits @5 but this album Gave me Many ?. 1st off they got a new sound michuangese that wasnt a str8 smash. But they still manage to squese out a couple of hits. Now there Lyrics cant be Questioned still tha hot fire that led a good izmatick Rating. Now for the Hitz (Akwid - Si Pudiera And the super Latin hip hop hit Sentir la Vida).They may not win another grammy with this one but they got my vote
5,Another Awesome Breed Read,"Lora Leigh continues to deliver with the 3rd in the Feline Breed series. Kane and Sherra's story gives you a slightly different slant on what its like to mate with a Breed... If you have read the first book, Tempting the Beast and the second Man Within and liked them you certainly won't be disapointed with this... A great read."
5,kiss of heat (feline breeds three),this one is so very hot so much desire and sex possesiveness. my women grrrr!love it.
5,Another great book in a great series,I love how there's a story about a female breed. I love the characters and the history behind them. Can't wait to read more about the females!
3,ok,"Would by again from Amazon. They product is always as advertised, packaged and mailed on time. I have bought many products from Amazon with no problems."
3,3 1/2 STARS,"The story gets a 4, the love scenes gets a 4, put it together and it worked only up to 3 and 1/2.The story line was getting better up to halfway through and then started flatlining. It seemed the author just threw in some characters (Seth and the chaffeur) hap-hazardly just to create more action.The chemistry between Kane and Sherra was great until again, halfway through, where it just started getting old (""Do something already!""). Towards the end the author did make a comeback with the relationship, however the storyline never really did revive. It was alright, but not great.Definately worth a read if you have patience and don't mind wanting to beat characters senseless with wiffle bats. :-)"
4,Kiss of Heat:: Feline Breeds 3,"The new breeds are making way to create a nation all about their own and don't they deserve it! I found this book to be entertaining, a conversation piece and, of course, erotic."
4,Kiss of Heat: Feline Breeds 3,I have enjoyed this book. The author brings the charactors to life and makes you think about the what if....I have always wondered what would happen it would be like to live in a different world much like our own and this series has answered it. I would like it.
1,Kiss of Heat: Feline Breeds 3,I was impressed with how quickly my order arrived. The book was difficult to find; but I found it at Amazon. The story was great!
2,"DataPlay has gone out of business, don't buy this product","Interesting product, but DataPlay went out of business on 10/15. There doens't seem any future for this product. I wouldn't buy it.see storyhttp://news.com.com/2100-1040-962131.html?tag=fd_top_2"
1,Avoid this product!,"Please read the editorial review. Pay attention to the product limitations and to the fact that ""recording industry is really pushing the DataPlay format"".Do not buy products witch limits your rights to use music, that you paid for, the way you want. Buy Archos or other products which are open and do not limit your rights."
1,smaller isn't better,"all the technology aside....I couldn't handle the disk itself, you can't even see what you're doing, it's friggin impossible to load, hard to eject, great if you're a gnome, but for us HUMANS....like eating with an itty bitty fork. Hey you can take the itty bitty fork everywhere. and be just as frustrated, everywhere."
1,Data Play stinks,(Money) for a player is not the big problem...the issue is (Money) for a non re-writable disc. I decided to get the Archos Jukebox Multimedia...has 20GB of storage and even play's Divx videos/movies on the little screen on the Unit. Why would you want to worry about carrying extra discs?
5,Big Band Jazz Masterpiece,"What a band this is! Anyone who has heard this band before knows what an outstanding band it is. But this cd, nearly 74 minutes worth of music, is a remarkable achievement. From the stunning Body & Soul onward, one great tune follows another. The excellent musicians play the intricate charts with aplomb. For those who consider themselves Modern big band or jazz fans, this cd is an absolute must. Behold a truly great album."
5,Best Shearling Value,"I have pink & black Patti Suede/Shearling Scuff Slippers. The soft shearling linings are soft, fluffy, & comfortable. The high quality suede with shearling trim is durable & beautiful. The slippers hold their shape with heavy use, and the sturdy & comfortable heel does not collapse. You will not find a real shearling slipper that is as good looking. It is not bulky and boxy as many other real shearling slippers are, and the Pattis are offered at a reasonable price. Sizes are true."
1,Don't buy this in black....,I would think that a slipper in this price range would ensure that the dye does not bleed - a TOTAL waste of money because my feet a such a dirty black after wearing these slippers. It doesn't matter if my feet are wet or dry - it is disgusting. Such a waste and disappointment.
5,"Catchy beats, great guitar, great lyrics","I've owned it for 9 months and people inquire who the artist is all the time. I typically toss it into a playlist and parties I host and it gets discussions going quite often.I stumbled across it on MTV and then listened to it here on Amazon before purchasing the CD. One of the better ""new emerging artist"" type of CD purchases I have made over the last 5-10 years. Pete Yorn (Music for the morning after) was another great CD that people always rave about or ask questions about."
4,disliked it at first...and then LOVED it,"""Discotech"" and ""Find a New Way"", the more danceable songs, were my favorites. My second favorites were ""Closer to You"", ""Close you eyes"" and some other more acoustically clean songs. Mr. Keyes does his best work on the acoustic numbers. However, songs like ""Take it or Leave it"" and ""Tell Me"", had to grow on me (although, the song ""Give Up"" still feels like overkill). This album is great, considering that many genres ( r&b, alternative, dance/electronica, indie...) are covered on it--which is pretty impressive. If you want something that is a little bit of everything, Too Young to Fight It is your best bet."

1,Way too religious,"Someone recommended this to me and I thought it would be a good read. I had Hodgkins Lymphoma and wanted to read about other stories, this is nothing but christian rhetoric spewed out about how God saved everyone and gave them a 2nd chance. Do not buy"
5,Fill up the bathtub with Mazola oil!,"Mizz Shepherds warm vibrato made my spine tingle almost as muchas the cold February night. mmm smores. It all started when Iplopped in the CD and ""Ain't Misbehavin'"" came on and it totally kicked the trip into high gear. Time stood still with Cybill, hovering above the good ol' VW bus. Moonlighting was my favorite musical of the 80's, I do believe it was a conspiracy to cancel it.Nothing makes me feel summer in my vanes like the hit title track ""Vanilla."" Especially when she lists off all of the ice cream flavors and her silly predicament with the ice cream man. I have found that a particular note in the song ""Vanilla"" contains one of the single most unsustained musical notes ever performed by a television actress/diva performer in the history.'nuff said........go by it now!"
5,Great CD Very overpriced.,"For anyone who likes traditional concert band music this is the GOLD STANDARD!!!The late Leonard Smith was probably the greatest band director since SOUSA. The Detroit Concert Band was top notch musicians giving top notch performances. The selections are some of the most delightful concert band music to be found. This was originally a 19 LP set of albums recorded in the late 70s and early 80s. Leonard Smith had planed it to be a 36 lp set, but sadly the project was never completed. The GEMS 5 CD set is superbly remastered by Walking Frog Records, but sadly is a very incomplete set of the selections on the 19 LPs. The liner notes are also very skimpy and inadequate. Beware of the price. The list price from WalkingFrog is a very, very stiff $74.95 plus shipping. Very good CDs, well worth having but seriously overpriced!!! Even worse, some Amazon sellers are charging even higher prices, one greedy retailer even wants $99 for a used set. Buyer beware!!"
1,French Intelligence = conspiracy theorists,"Here the authors seem to confirm every bad joke about the French media, military, and their intelligence community. While they did demonstrate (sort of) the links between legitimate Mid Eastern business interests and terrorism (which are real), they draw some pretty wild conclusions based on a thin line that are -- in the French popular tradition -- anti-US establishment. They had an agenda with this book and showed it at the end. Don't make this one a priority -- read Newsweek instead."
1,More Like Forbidden Libel,I found this book utterly fascinating when it came out and I have followed the contents and authors closely. Since then the authors have lost every libel action filed against them and the US has had to retract Mr. Brisard's congressional testimony. It also develops that he never did work for the United Nations despite saying so. Even though I used to think this book had the truth about 9/11 now I think it is just conspiracy theory and that's sad.Gemma
5,Mindblowing,"This book will make you mad and it should. It is a scathingindictment of the Bush oil cartel and the coterie of Saudi's King Faud and his minions. 9/11 happened because of the Bushfamily's desire to seek a pipeline into Afghanistan. You will find out many things i.e. the Bush family did lots of business with the Bin Laden family, the Saudi's are NOT our friends, the Saudi's supplied the money for the religious indoctrination intofanaticism of the Taliban and much more......"
4,"Forbidden Truth: U.S.-Taliban Secret Oil Diplomacy, Saudi Arabia and the Failed Search for bin Laden",good
4,Pretty Good Piece Work,"The Manager's Guide to Business Writing, is a good starting reference book for those us who struggle in the creation of wide range of business related writings, such as: letters, reports, memos etc. It is a fairly comprehansive book including chapters ranging from the proper use of words in business writing to the appropriate structuring of reports, letters etc. Highly recommended."
3,Not what I expected.,"Good reference for writing letters, proposals or memos, but not what I had expected. I was looking for a book that delved more into the art of writing business articles for magazines. This is what I get for judging a book by its title. Next time, I'll peruse through the book a bit more diligently."
4,And Bush kisses their Asses?,"Great movie. Nice portrayal of the darker side of life in Saudi Arabia. Leads one to once again ask why the U.S. is on such friendly terms with the Saudis, and is not more aggressive in pressing for human rights in that country. The answer, of course is oil. No war but class war."
2,Fred's Human Cargo Review,"It was a Blockbuster used VHS. The case was OK, but changing the tracking between the extremes of the VHS player would not get rid of the static horizontal line at the bottom of the image. Very annoying, but for the price, what one expected, but not hoped for."
1,Not worth watching.,"I have to say, this film is not worth watching or buying. Don't waste your time with it."
3,Definetly Could have been better...,"This game is kind of a disappointment. The visuals on the game are alright. Nothing spectacular. They get boring after a while. It seems like they just rushed this game out, since there was nothing out on the XBOX. They could have spent the time to make a game that utilizes the power of the console, but instead put out a game that had much more potential. They diin't make it XBOX live compatible. But that doesn't mean you can't play it online. If you have high speed internet, you can download tunnel software, such as XBox Connect or Xlink Kai. With these programs you can duel other duelists around the world. Not as good as Xbox live, but at least it is free. So over all this game could be better, but since i only payed 15 dollars for it. I guess i can't hate all that much on it."
4,Looks better than it is,"My 8 year old is a Yu Gi Oh fanatic...a real card collector and my 4 year old likes game battling. When you look on the back of this XBox game, it appears to be a game where you play the actual card game and then battle your monsters.[...]BR>1. You cannot play a 2 player game unless your buddy down the street bring over HIS XBox console WITH his OWN Yu Gi Oh game and you have a system LINK cable. (What 8 year olds do that anyway) Anyone playing this game will want to battle other players not the Computer Players!2. There is no actual batlle. The monsters flash in front of you very fast. You get a 3 second glimpse of themVery dissapointing [...]."
3,Really dispointing!,Yu-gi-oh finally comes to the x-box and I was waiting a long time for it and it wasent that good! Frist of all the monsters don't do anything it shows the picture of them then they do nothing when they attack! Then it take a really really long time to get good cards. You wont get trape and magic cards unless you play for a really long time! Then the people you battle are not very smart. I thought this would be a graet game but it is not that good. If you are a person who will plsy this for a long time you will like this game. The good things about the game are that it has a lot of diffrent cards and it has good grafics.
5,god card in this is fake,this may not be about the game but the god card is not real if it has limitted edisin on it so i say show the god card on the web site
5,I have a question,Can this be played on the 360? I wanna buy. But only if it' can play on the 360. Someone let me know please
3,"Good, but a little frustrating.","I found this game to be the closest to the actual trading card game. Many of the Yu-Gi-Oh! video games add strange gimmicks or gameplay elements that deviate from the original forumla, which means that fans of the games are often disappointed. Meanwhile, this edition of the game is actually pretty clings to the basics and is a rather good simulator of the trading card game itself.The only drawback is that it is quite difficult to get new cards for use in battle. You're often pitted against people with much better cards than you, and your only method to get better is by beating said opponents in what is often just a lucky hand. All in all, however, this game is good and worth the price for sure."
4,"Loved the movie, but not the sound track","I can't add anything beyond what has been said about the movie. Bill Hart was a great actor for his time, and I really enjoy the few movies still available.I was a little disappointed in the quality of the accompanying score... it sound rather like a synthesizer set to sound like an organ throughout the movie. I have heard other versions of this movie with orchestral soundtracks which are better. Also, the tinny synthesizer sound starts to grate after a while.One other slight nit: I have a tough time seeing ""His Bitter Pill"" as a parody on Hart, like the packaging says. The main character is nothing like Hart in any way, and it seems that a parody should have some comparisons.Nevertheless, the Bitter Pill movie is OK and the Hart movie is wonderful... I just wanted to toss in a couple small complaints."
1,cheap,"The rod on this towel bar is very weak and bends with any pressure applied. I doubt it will last very long. The brushed nickle looks great, but the bar feels very cheap."
5,Much Needed Long Towel Bar,"Easy to hang and looks awesome in my newly painted and bathroom. I was tired of the traditional chrome, so the oil rubbed bronze is a nice and welcome change. Looks great!"
3,"Nice look, but NOT oil- rubbed bronze","Nice looking, it has the look that i was looking for that goes with the other bathroom accessories. It is not oil- bronzed, however. It is plain black. It does not look like the rest of oil- bronzed products that I bought to go with it. But it is still a beautiful piece, nice and sturdy and spacious to hang stuff."
4,"Beautiful towel bars, but one slight issue to note","I love the look of these bars and the anchors are very solid except for the actual bar - it's hollow. It will definitely bend over time when someone is pulling the towel off the bar, especially kids. My solution for this is to buy a wooden dowel to insert inside the bar for reinforcement and re-hang."
5,Easy to Install!,One of the few products I have purchased which came with excellent instructions and installation hardware. This along with the installation template makes it a breeze to install even for a novice. The towel bar is attactive to the eye but the only negative is that the bar itself is lighweight and just does not feel solid and sturdy so it might bend easily. But as long as your kids don't try to use it as a monkey bar you should be fine. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.
2,Product is just OK. Doesnt present rich look.,"This product is just OK. It doesn't present rich look. Its simple. For a lower price, you can find very nice sturdy and rich items in TJMaxx homegoods store. If you love your home very much and plan on rich fixtures, this is not for you.However fixing these was easy. I dont blame their quality but the looks is that that great."
2,Not the real thing,"Since voicelessness (in all guises) is a huge part of what Phoolan Devi has spent her life resisting, it's important that we hear her story FROM HER. There's an autobiography called ""I, Phoolan Devi"" that's available in England (etc.?)(still haven't seen it anywhere in the States). It was told by Devi, transcribed to text, and o.k.'d by Devi page-by-page."
4,dallas IV,"My wife loves the Dallas series and watches them every chance she gets, from season one on. It is a good way to watch a series with fewer interruptions and on your own schedule."
5,New to Dallas,I am a new comer of watching Dallas and I am Addicted! I wish that they would come out with the rest of the seasons faster. Once I buy a season I watch it over a weekend I cant turn it off. My other favorite is Knots Landing. I just got the first season and have already watched the whole thing.
5,Classic Era of Dallas,back in the day JR Ewing was the Man holding it down at Ewing Oil until he got Shot. the first few episodes hold the drama.I've been waiting years to get shows on DVD. this was always must watching for me on fridays back in the day.the cast was in a Golden run back in the day.alot of interesting twists&turns at the Southfork ranch. One of the Greatest TV Shows Ever.
4,Wonderful Memories,"I love the old series of ""Dallas"" and am buying 2 at a time to fill in the spaces between anything worth watching on the regular tv. I would have given this 5 stars, but there are no English subtitles. Don't know why, as the first 3 seasons were captioned."
1,Never received!!! Its been over a month,"I am disapointed I never received this. If you are unable to ship an item, it would be nice to receive notification. I am disapointed in the service. I have gotten the first three additions, with no problem. This was to be a gift."
3,The quality is poor,"No need to discuss the season. 100% perfect.What I didn't like is the double layer discs that can be easily damaged if handled improperly by other people.And worse, some of the episodes weren't digitally enhanced and in some cases, the image is very very poor. I even compared them against the tapes I have in VHS.I think we, DALLAS fan deserve better than that."
1,"Boring, expensive","I had to buy this for school and what I've watched so far is incredibly boring. Also, my boyfriend told me it's on Netflix for a lot cheaper."
2,Two stars and two thumbs down.,"I was really excited to get this DVD set. Upon arrival I quickly popped it in my DVD player and watched attentively as I became very bored and very disenchanted.The DVDs are organized in to various chapters which sound interesting, however, the selection of artists seemingly do not fit in to the themes of the chapters. I felt like the directors of the show were really stretching to make a connection within the topic of each chapter. To the lesser-informed this DVD might give you some background of the world of contemporary art but it will most likely confuse you as it does.To make a long story short, I was looking for a DVD that would key me in on the artist's M.O. but really this set only shows you a general overview of their art while focusing on the artist's neuroses and not explaining the relevance of their works in recent history.My suggestion is to forego this DVD set, pick up a concise book on modern art and draw your own conclusions as you will."
5,Just great,"I have other Steven Hall CD's and enjoy them very much, but this one with 2 piano's is the best. The choice of musical pieces and the combination of 2 pianos make this one of my favorite CD's. I have given it to other people who also enjoy piano music. I heartily recommend it."
4,Retro!,"I had one of these back in the '70s, loved it. This is the first that I've seen these since. ""Back in the day"" the leather was padded, this isn't, but it does serve the purpose for which it was made."
2,"Didn't care for this product, but the company returned w/o issue","Did not fit well at all, but could be because my wrists are thin. The company I purchased this thru had good return policy so no issues sending back."
5,Opened a whole new world.,"We set up bird feeders in the little backyard of our urban condominium and watched as the birds came to feed. That was fun, but now we wanted to know more about those birds, and this book does just that. Each specie has a nice colour picture, description and a bit of advice on where and how to spot them. When we travel around the province visiting family or camping, this book is by our side with a pair of binoculars. We have given this book as a gift to a number of our family and friends."
2,Product of a confused mind?,"In defense of this author, I would mention that she does provide a historical note at the end of the book (but does not indicate its presence via index). Reading this note does help some of the textual fog clear - but basically, this work seems the product of a confused mind. People and places show up in the narrative without even contextual clues as to their meaning, location or identity. I read constantly, and rarely observe such disjointed thinking on the part of an author.Too bad - otherwise the novel/mystery has potential. What were her editors thinking? Did she even HAVE editors? The dialogue is often quite clever and characters are inventively drawn. Overall, however, I am less than charmed by the use of a prostitute as protagonist. Is it really necessary? Or is the author ""reaching"" for a salacious ruse in hopes of gaining readership?"
2,Your child may find it boring,"I ordered this because I grew up with it; ""El Show de Topo Gigio"" was very popular in Hispanic markets and as a kid I enjoyed it quite a bit. Adults liked it too; I believe that for a while it was shown as part of the evening fare. So I thought it would be a good idea to buy Volumes 1-4 for my daughter, who's two-and-a-half years old.She hated it.The show begins with Topo Gigio conversing with an older gentleman, sort of the interchange Johnny Carson had with Ed McMann...that goes on for several minutes and gets monotonous quick. Then it switches to Topo Gigio doing some cutesy skits.I've seen my daughter disinterested in some children's videos, this is the first one that actually made her cry. I think it's just too outdated compared to modern fare.If you're a diehard Topo Gigio fan and want this as a collectible or to reminisce, it's fine. But as children's fare, I cannot recommend it."
1,didn't do a thing for me,"I tired the product per direction on package label, but did not notice major difference; still felt hungry and at a lot."
2,Don McLean - Greatest Hits Live,"This compilation of the ""master's"" work would seem to be as good as it gets. However, for whatever reason(s), a number of the classic McLean songs - American Pie, for one - are presented in a rendition that is noticeably foreign to the original. I was very disappointed and would NOT recommend this album to anyone looking for the ""real"" Don McLean."
4,I Like It,"I know there was some other comments about thhe difference between these and the studio versions, but that's part of being an artist. The performance and the material selection on this album is great and Don made a VERY good choice in backing musicians. This is a wonderful album and I recomend it to all."
3,Don McLean -Greatest Hits Live,"This would probably suffice as as good a compilation of the ""master's"" work as one could ask for. However, for whatever reason, many of the songs are rendered in a different style than the original-specifically the classic American Pie. I was NOT impressed and would not recommend this CD - there are too many others that remain true to the original format and renditions."
1,"tuneless songs, trite lyrics","Don McLean created one great album, American Pie. Evidently that was all he had in him, because he's never written another song I care to listen to. The songs on this ""greatest hits"" collection are dull, the singing bad even on the standards, and the lyrics trite: war is bad, greed is bad, love is good. There is even a kind of rap song in which McLean shows some awareness that, whatever he had, he's lost it."
4,Perfect entry point for Lewis & Clark books,"My daughter, age 8, is dog obsessed, and when I spied this book in the library, I knew it would be a perfect way to get her interested in the amazing tail of the Corps of Discovery and even non-fiction, real-life history in general. The book is very readable and accompanied by beautiful, lush, full-color, painted illustrations. Her favorite chapter is that which describes Lewis' near-brush with death while in the inadvertent path of a buffalo and Seaman's heroic alert. I read this book aloud with her, and soon after, she asked to check-out more Lewis & Clark books at the library to read on her own. Success!"
4,A Real Page Turner By:DLS Grade 5,"This phenomenal book told a rich about the adventures of a dog with his masters, Lewis and Clark. This volouminous story begins with Seaman, a brave dog, but a young lonsome inexperienced puppy. One day a weary traveler named Meriwether Lewis asks two soldiers on the docks he was stationed at where he could get a dog. To his luck they end up giving him Seaman.Seaman gets his first trial. The men are starting to get hungry. Seaman spots a large group of beavers down stream. He decides he could help the crew. He succedes, but while the crew is eating they find that Seaman was hurt. They quickly tend to his hurt leg.The next day Indians start coming out of the bushes from all angles and are heading right for Seaman.This book was a good read and I recomend this book to you!"
4,A must buy,"I found this very easy to understand, as did my husband who had no prior knowledge of the Japanese language. I read it many times before our trip, in order to remember important basic words.We referred to it many times during our trip, and it was very usefull. I would suggest everyone purchase it.Its small size is also great, easy to put in a pocket, backpack or handbag."
4,"Very good in the beginning, but after that, it's ok","Just like I said. The first part of this phrasebook helps you understand grammar, small phrases, and many words, but after that it just tells you a lot of the things like sentences and more questions and answers.I recommend this if you are travelling, but if you are just trying to learn the language, I would not recommend it because it's hard to remember all of the questions, answers, and phrases it contains from about the 1/4 to the end of the book.But it was really good in explaining grammar, pronouns, and many other things. So buy it if you want."
1,used swimsuit,"This swimsuit underwent major alteration, all tags and labelswere cut and attached back in wrong places.I did't want to agrovate myself and and return product,just disposed it. Very bad experience.Anna"
4,music to drive by ...,"i brought this for my husband for Christmas, we are planning to drive route 66 this year and thought this would be a fun gift.It is great, some real classic songs by original artists.Route 66 of course, 24 hours to Tulsa, Ramblin' Man, Passadena ... it's a fun CD to have in the car, and we'll certainly be taking it on our trip"
5,Great machine for the money!,"My wife is very happy with this machine, very easy to use. User friendly for more advanced projects."
4,Singer 7412,"The seller sent me Singer 7412 instead of 7442 as a sale contract. But it is good enough to me.The thread is jamping on the bottom I have to use thin blade to cut it so I can remove fabric out of machine.Otherwise, it is good sewing machine."
2,"Ok, but needle threader is a problem","This is an ok machine, especially for light sewing. However, like several others, the hook for the Auto Needle Threader is missing from mine so that feature does not work. Very disappointed that such a feature that Singer touts as a major item for their product would be missing from some machines. This was one of the reasons I bought this model. Singer will not get my recommendation for this sewing machine."
3,singer 7442 review,"This machine works great. The needle threader does not work. It is not installed correctly. For what I paid, I can thread the needle myself. I have used this machine steadily for the past few weeks. It is a pleasure to use. I miss some of the things you get with a more expensive machine, For this price I have a machine that is fun to use. I would recommend to anyone."
4,Novice User,This is a replacement for my 1969 Singer sewing machine that was damaged in a move across country. After reading other reviews for this machine I was hesitate but the price was right. I received the machine quickly and after the intial attempt to thread the bobbin and needle I am very happy with the ease of use.I would recommend this sewing machine!
1,Not even worth the effort to use it as an anchor!,"I have to sew, and I bought this machine as a back up for when my dinosaur needed to go to the doctor for tune ups. I used it for less than 2 hours, and it broke. The repair, $75.00 later, and no kidding, 10 minutes into it's second use, it broke again. Same problem. I am not a novice. This was light duty stuff, not sewing tents. I was making bags to wrap Christmas Presents in. I'm devastated that Singer, a household name for sewing, has sold out to make a dollar, instead of doing what is right. Shame on your Singer! Don't buy this product, or any other Singer unless you want an anchor for your fishing boat!"
1,Nothing but trouble,This machine has been nothing but a headache from the day it came out of the box. Defective out of the box and has had chronic issues with the tension set up. It isn't capable of sewing an entire project without ending up in the repair shop. Singer refused to stand behind their product.
3,It sews... I guess,"I have one of these machines. It works for the most part... It doesn't like sewing through more than 3 layers of almost any fabric and makes a loud knocking sound when it is being taxed. I expect this machine will not last long.It has an incredibly terrible reverse function. Its a button located to the upper right of the needle. It is annoying because it always sews one stich forward and then starts going backwards instead of just sewing backwards. Also the computerized-ness of it is annoying if you are sewing backwards and stop and then decide you want to sew backwards a little further it will not let you. Pressing the button will do nothing until you sew forward again.If I was buying another machine I would either buy a nice vintage machine or at least another brand (juki most likely), possibly with metal gears and no computer inside."
1,Don't buy this machine,"I bought this machine in June '07. It sewed fine for about 3 mo. Then I started having trouble with the auto tension. I finally sent it in to try to get it repaired. I was told by the repair center, that the part is no longer available, and sent the machine back, un-repaired. Now I'm stuck with trying to return it for a 'aprtial refund'. This machine is not worth considering. I wouldn't take one for free!LGN, KS"
1,Terrible Machine- stay away!,I purchased this machine less then one year ago. It has been repaired three times since; twice for the take up lever disconnecting and falling into the casing. My hope was to use this machine to do machine quilting and I have had to resort to doing most of the work by hand. My next purchase will definitely NOT be a Singer. The repair costs have almost equalled the purchase cost. Not a good deal. This machine has inferior quality and workmanship. Made in China.I will be buying a new machine soon and it definitely won't be a Singer. Bernina here I come!Don's wife.....
5,Great Cover,"This is a great cover. It replaces another Dowco cover that was used for I don't know for how long. Got it with the bike when I bought it. It fits very well, even with a windshield and rigid saddle bags (Shadow ACE 750). The heat shields definitely work; I cover the bike right after riding and have no problems. We've had some windy days here in the NE and with the strap, it stayed on. Keeps the bike clean and dry. I considered other brands and am glad I went with this one."
5,Excellent!,Wonderful product at a good price. I use it daily & am very pleased with it. Wears well & isn't too stiff.
1,not nearly as funny as we thought it would be,"heard this guy on the radio, and thought he was hilarious. Ordered this for my husband for Christmas. very few laughs. A bit of a disappointment."
5,Good Clean Fun!!!!,"The Testimony included with this DVD is worth the purchase price.Jeff Allen is a funny, funny man and a clean comic. One you could take your kids or your grandma to hear and not be afraid of what they might hear."
4,Extremely Funny,This has been one of the funniest comedians I have ever heard. It kept me laughing ... I watch it over and over again.
4,This is a funny and wholesome DVD for families and couples.,"Jeff Allen is very funny and really gets the humor in marriage as well as raising kids, especially with ADHD. Recommended for anyone, but Christians will appreciate the clean humor."
2,diving watch band,Looking for a band that would fit over a 7 mm wetsuit to use with a Casio dive watch. This isn't long enough. Otherwise it seems fine.
2,Watch Band Black Nylon Sprot Milityar Strap 19mm,This watch band and a watch band spring band tool were a suggested purchase with a watch I was orderering. This band didn't even fit the watch I found out after taking to a jeweler. Bad suggestion as it turns out. The band itself is decent but not for my watch.
2,Works but certainly not durable,Rec'd my order promptly however this product is not very durable. Within 2 months the band began to fray and break apart at the seams.Bottom line: not worth the ten bucks.
4,Around America by 172,"Being an oldie private pilot in Australia I'm a sucker for stories about flying, especially light aircraft flying. I fly light club aircraft, mainly C172's but also PA28's.I plotted David Helms journey around the USA on an old atlas I had and that made the journey very enjoyable for me. Flying in the USA appears to be a lot more regulated than in Oz, here we have lots of unrestricted type G airspace so you can pretty well fly around Australia without troubling ATC much providing you stay clear of the main cities. I was a bit troubled by David's ""pushonitis"" attitude when it didnt seem real necessary but he is a skilled instrument rated pilot so I can understand him doing it. Me, I fly VFR for pleasure and much of that pleasure is obtained from sightseeing from the air. David missed out a lot of great scenery by doing a lot of flying in IMC conditions.All up I learned quite a bit about America and about flying in that country and thats what I wanted from the book. Thanks David."
4,"A book for the ""Flyer"" in all of us","As someone involved in aviation for 34 years I enjoyed reading about the adventures of David Helms. I think most pilots dream of doing a trip like his once in a lifetime. There were some good ""pointers"" that I would consider if I get to undertake a trip like that."
5,Satchmo Gives Incomparable Interpretation to Waller,"If you love Louis Armstrong, buy it. If you love Fats Waller, buy it. If you just love jazz with a swing beat, then this collection is for you. Satchmo gives us an incomparable interpretation of Waller's music that would have made the corpulent keyboard king himself very proud indeed. It is soooo SWEET! You won't be disappointed.Armstrong infuses these pieces with a style very true to Fats' own, including the humour and wit that Satchmo weaves into the lyrics.The sound is smooth, and the rhythm is HOT! Recording quality is very good, and the selection is impecable -- some of Waller's greatest hits. This is a great gift item, and I plan to give it to my Dad [a lifelong big band fan and a dancing fool] for his 85th birthday next month."
5,Two with Fats,"Could someone explain the difference between the two ""with FAts"". One is expensive by Columbia. The other is cheap by a lesser label. What is up?"
5,Now THIS is jazz!,"""Satch Meets Fats"" is considered to be one of George Avakian's two favorite albums that he produced with Armstrong. Listening to it, it's easy to see why! The tracks here are out of this world and Satch's trumpet-playing and singing (especially his scat-singing) are nothing short of genius. Just listen to ""Blue Turning Grey over You"", ""Squeeze Me"", and ""I've Got a Feeling I'm Falling"" if you don't believe me! The alternative takes and earlier 1920s Satch recordings of Waller songs only make this album an absolute must for any serious jazz fan. Highly recommended!"
1,formulaic and not gripping,"The plot, characters etc were stereotypes from others of the genre, and the writing was weak. Stick with Tom Clancy or David Poyer. I also learned zero about flying - all the technical material was skipped over. (Unlike, for example, Punk's War.)"
3,"HELP ME!!!!! "" I am Running!""","Yeah thats how this game goes. The most frustrating thing I have ever played. ""Go to the save point."" ""Go to the Desk? OK"" ""No GO TO THE SAVE POINT!!!!"" ""Leave the room? You got it."" ""No go to the Save POINT!!!!!!"" ""I am walking"" But I don't stop playing even though I've ripped out half my hair. Its just that I've never played anything like this and thats kinda exciting. If you don't have much patience for anything don't play this game, but if you can put up with this woman's stupidity give it a shot...it might surprise you."
5,Excellent game!!,"This game is an absolutely great game except around the middle of the game, the character starts -not-understanding- your commands, you say "" check the bed"" and she goes to the bathroom, but anyway, this is one of the best games i've played ( and i have played over 250.)"
4,Generally Happy Customer,"The filters work as advertised in the Humidifier, the only reason I didn't give a 5 star review is I wish they lasted just a touch longer."
2,short life span,"I should have paid attention to the other reviews. Stopped wicking water after 2 weeks. A universal filter from Home Depot, though a bit short, has worked much, much better for same price."
2,NOT the Kenmore Filter You Think You're Buying!!!,"I purchased five of these filters, thinking I was getting ""Sears Kenmore Humidifier Wick Filter Replacement, 42-14906,"" as advertised in the listing title and product details (""Item model number: 42-14906""). Instead, I got the an off-brand filter, the BestAir brand HumidiWick filter, that claims to fit the Kenmore 14410 humidifier. The title and product description are very misleading.I'm giving this two stars instead of only one star because it was delivered quickly."
3,Buy it for less.,"If you really want this particular cd for your collection, then go ahead and buy it for the asking price of $74.00. However, if you just want the music and don't care about the cover, then buy ""The Best of Charley Pride"" for $3.50...new. It contains all the songs listed on this cd PLUS the other cd also gives you an extra song."
1,Poorly made and hazardous to one's health!,"I bought this gift for my mother for Mother's Day. From what she tells me, the moment she opened the box, a broken piece of the equipment launched out and nearly smacked her in the eye! Further investigation revealed the equipment to be VERY poorly made.Also, my mother attempted to contact the manufacture of the product, and they have seemingly ignored all her of her attempts.I highly recommend trying some other product."
1,poor quality - breaks.,I need to send back. the tubing breaks.Need info about sending back.Poor quality
1,check it out,"an excellent commentary for the lay teacher. scholarly - yet readable. informative, all-around good resource with a conversative bend. i plan to seek the entire set."
4,Courting an Angel,"This book reveals actual human feelings of the characters involved. Love, humor, mischief, cruelty and how we are mis-guided at times. The supporting characters add a remarkable balance to the exciting journey that the couple takes you on. Rob and Gordon`s story gives you the faith that love can conquer all obstacles. This is one adventure you don't want to miss reading."
4,a truth about life,"I have not yet read the book (the movie does make me wish to do so), so I won't be offering any comparisons. That said, I think this is a fine story. I find no fault with the plot. (Except... I do wonder what would happen when that water evaporates, and what about if and when the world does come to an end...?) There is a real philosophical and psychological question, about something that touches us all, at the heart of this movie: Would you really want to live forever? The story makes you face that question and reveals some truths about the reality of immortality in the wordly sense, without forcing the lessons down your throat. It is a lovely film, with beautiful natural scenery, stirring music and some of the best acting ever. I imagine the story will be too much for the sensibilities of some, but it is worth viewing for those who have the courage to consider what life would be without death. (The filmmakers' commentary adds to your appreciation of the art in this movie.)"
5,Great,"Perfect, my daughter and her class loved watching the movie. And she loved being able to watch it on family night"
3,Bledal and Jackson are flaws,"The cast is big, as is the story. The real problem is I see Bledal's character like her character on Gilmore Girls. Jackson's is a little to arrogant and not enjoyable."
3,A Chick Flick With a Twist.,"TUCK EVERLASTING is most definitely a chick flick. However, it's a chick flick with a slight twist. I don't want to give the ending away, but even though it's a satisfying ending, it doesn't end with a ""happily ever after."" The acting is good, but not great. I've never read the book or seen the original movie, but I found the story to flow really well with only the occassional ""romantic"" element distracting from the plot (e.g. the dance seen, swimming in the pond). TUCK EVERLASTING isn't too bad of a movie, but there's nothing really original here either. It's not the typical chick flick and is a film that most members of the family can at least tolerate if not enjoy."
2,Boring,"Family films have to be able to hold the attention of both young children and grown adults; Tuck Everlasting put me to sleep three times. The movie tries to feed off the enchanting idea of being able to live forever and remain forever young. Unfortunately Disney could not pull off the magic touch on this slacker.Almost the entire movie takes place in the woods, and while there was some great cinematography, there were almost no scenery changes. Most of this movie tried to be a period piece and hanging out in the woods all day long is a cheesy way to skip out on a budget. Disney has more than enough money to invest into something that could have been truly fantastic but instead produced a disappointment.Young teenagers might find the love story half way romantic and some people might get caught up in the forest bit, but I had difficulties staying awake and would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Tuck Everlasting,"We received this video in a timely manner but when we went to play it, a message came up saying ""....regional restrictions"" and it wouldn't play. Never had this happen before and have not gotten a reply from the vendor. I understand this is a great movie but I wouldn't know."
4,A Fun Movie For Adults and Kids!,"""Tuck Everlasting"" was originally produced in 1980, but this later Disney version is its equal, if not better. Several cast members have quite extensive resume's, including Sissy Spacek, William Hurt and Ben Kingsley. This is a magical mystery movie, and is also thought-inspiring, romantic ... and fun, too!"
5,tuck everylasting,"delightful book made into a beautiful movie. perfect gift for every grandchild and if you are lucky, they will invite granma and granpa sit watch with them."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"This is the story of a rebellious girl named Winnie, faced with a very tough decision--does she want to live forever? She is faced with this choice after meeting with the Tucks, a family that unwittingly became immortal after a drink from a very special spring. It is also a story of greed, of people who would take advantage of this gift from the spring.I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was--I read the book when I was younger, didn't like it at all, and was expecting not to like the movie either. However, I found it to be very entertaining and even left me with lingering questions after the movie was over (Would I want to live forever?, for example). I really enjoyed the musical score as well.The acting was quite good, with performances by Sissy Spacek, William Hurt, and Alexis Bledel, among others.Although it started off a bit slowly, the movie progressed quickly and became very interesting. Highly recommended!"
3,"A timeless tale,but no real chemistry between Winnie and Jesse.","I read the book as a teen in the 70's and really enjoyed it. As an adult with a small child and a more realistic notion of,""mortality,"" I related to the film on a different and more mature level. Regardless, it is a timeless tale for all ages.One minor criticism is that I didn't sense any real romantic tension between Winnie and Jesse. Perhaps the problem was with casting. They looked so much alike that they seemed like brother and sister as opposed to passionate teens. Even when Winnie was doing that fireside dance, Jesse just seemed sort of oblivious.William Hurt who played the father is one of my favorite actors. At times he seemed slightly too sophisticated to play the unsophisticated father,especially since I tend to type cast him as,""Nick,"" from the Big Chill.I enjoyed the movie but whoever cast Jesse should not have cast a guy who looked like Winnie's brother to play her love interest."
5,Tuck Everlasting vs the original,"I bought this movie before I had viewed it because 20 something years ago I watched a movie also by this name. It was very good and I wanted to see what they had changed from the original. This one was just as good, but a little different from the original, but none the less very well made! They stayed with the same storyline, but a few things were changed in what actually happened in the first one I had seen. I would purchase it again and I am sure I will watch it over and over right along with the first one that was made! Hope everyone enjoys it as much as I have!"
1,I believe I received a pirated copy...my dvd doesn't work.,"I believe I received a pirated copy...my DVD doesn't work!! As soon as we place it in the DVD player, a message pops up saying ""please eject disc - playback not authorized in your region"". My daughter was pretty upset as this was a Christmas present for her. I would like my money back or an Amazon credit please.Thank you and Happy New Year :)"
4,the story is a bit thin but some scenes are simply powerful,"It was not as great a story or character development as I could have hoped for, but overall I was not dissapointed. The scenery was beautiful, the 2 main characters also were beautiful and they had some powerful scenes between them.The scene of him helping her in the water because she cannot swim is one of the most romantic and touching few minutes of film I have ever seen."
2,No Icing in the Oreo Cookie,"`Dead Serious' is all that backs up Tuck Everlasting. If you're a person who likes a good action or comedy movie you'll drop dead after you see this movie. It's no `Rush Hour' or ` Slap shot'. It's more like your classical ` Black Beauty', but if you're that kind of person then it is highly recommended. It has the idea of life and death. It's about a normal family who was going to settle in and they stop at a spring to refresh themselves with a bit of cool water, but the spring has a curse. Who ever takes a drink from the spring has everlasting life. For me the only expressive scenes were the start and the end of the movie. You know those Oreo cookies and the icing in the middle? Well the icing in my Oreo cookie has no icing in the it just like Tuck Everlastings middle part of the movie. This movie won't entertain any teenagers. There goes three of my rotten tomatoes."
3,It Was okay,"The movie was nice, but comparing with the book it would be a totally diferent story, it didin't have anything to do with it. But it was still fine."
2,Tuck Everlasting,Average customer review....4 1/2 stars?!?! Right. Though I've never read the book I think I would've found it more enjoyable than the movie. Maybe it was the acting of Jonathen Jackson that really bugged me. That voice...My main question after the end. And maybe this was answered at one point in the movie but I'm not recalling it. If one drink from the spring gives them life everlasting. Why the heck are they still drinking from it?
5,An Everlasting Story.,"Tuck Everlasting is a great story for all ages because they are characters that you can really relate to. The film will be just as great, as long as you stay true to the book as much as possible. For example, you cannot change their names for your own satifaction. Nor can you change the setting of the story for that would completely take away from what the Tuck's personality. This is, undeniably, an everlasting story."
1,Huge disappointment,"I am a teacher and have read this book with my fifth graders several times. They love it and I never grow tired of it. When the movie came out several years ago, my class at that time met at the theater to watch it. What a letdown for all of us! The story was changed and sexualized, I suppose, to make it more commercially appealing. The actors bore no resemblance to the lovable characters in the book. They absolutely ruined the story. It was a forgettable and disappointing movie for my students, but a long term bummer for me. If you are a fan of the book, do yourself a big favor and forget this movie."
5,One of the greatest movies of all time!,"Dfinatly a movie worth owning.The Tucks have a secret, the fontain of youth, but you'll be surprised at how the think about it. It really gives you a new look on everlasting life."
3,CELEBRATE LIFE'S MAGIC,"Eternal forces that seduce with life and death rewards have always been a staple of film stories.TUCK EVERLASTING is beautiful to look at and has already been hailed as a classic, although not a box office success.Loosely adapted from Natalie Babbitt's book, this fable about the Tuck family who have been blessed -- and cursed -- with everlasting life after drinking from a fountain of youth. The fine cast includes Sissy Spacek, William Hurt and Ben Kingsley. A teen romance plot, not in the book, finesses the idea that life is a magical gift and every moment counts. Amen."
4,definate tearjerker,"i just recently saw this movie and i was in tears about half way through it and the tears just didn't stop until the end, then they just got to be more abundant. Winnie's character was great and fit perfectly with Jessie's. the actors did a great job, though it took a while for me to get into the movie. i have yet to read the book, but i am going out to buy it as soon as possible so i can compare and contrast the two because i absolutely loved the movie. it's a must for anyone who likes innocent romance."
2,Not a film version of the delightful book.,"""Tuck Everlasting"" - the movie - is entertaining as far as it goes, and if you hadn't read the book, you would probably think it is just fine. However, the book is enchanting (and vastly superior to the movie). Unfortunately, all the changes made in the movie detract from the delightful character of the original story, so much so that there is only a shell left. If you read the book and are expecting this movie to tell the same story, it does not and you will be disappointed. If you have not read the book, I urge you to do so before seeing the movie, so the movie does not ruin what it retains of the plot."
2,Tuck Everlasting DVD,"This DVD is a little disappointing if you are looking for it to follow the story line of the book. The book is about a 10 year old girl. The movie increases her age to 15 in order to appeal to a wider audience. In doing so, I believe they lost some of the real meaning behind the book."
2,i think this movie was a little over rated,this was one movie i was looking forward to seeing but when i rented it this week it just was'nt as good as i thought it would be. i heard it was a good love story but i have sure seen a lot better. but the one thing i did'nt like the most was the ending it was so sad i heard so i had my kleenex's ready because i am a big CRIER at movies like this most of the time but this one i was very DRY EYED. so to me it was just over rated.
4,Awesome,"I liked how everything looked so real. It shows alot of bravery and its really, really good. I liked how they came up with such a good plan to get Mr. & Mrs. Tuck out of the prison. I would recommend that kids be at least 8 1/2 to watch the movie -- otherwise they might not understand everything."
5,A great fantasy.,I love this movie and have loved it from the first time I saw it. That is why I bought the DVD. The theme of the movie has been one of man's quest for centuries. I think the cast was perfect and that is why the acting was so good. Every one of the actors did a superb job. Go buy the DVD!!!
4,Worth it,"I love this movie. I have always been a huge fan of the book, and while this isn't perfectly in line with the book it is pretty darn close. Alexis Bledel is best known for her role on Gilmore Girls but she does a great job here as do her costars. This is a wonderful tale of life. I encourage you to read the book first, before watching the movie but if you don't you will still enjoy it."
4,Top Secret,"Who even thought someone could live forever? The Tuck family happens to be a different family from other families. This movie was much better than the book. The movie has more suspense. The director of the movie shows this event by using flashbacks. He shows a flash back when Miles was telling Tuck about someone who was following Jesse and Miles. The director flashbacks to a spooky train scene with horror music, smoke, and fog. Right from out of the fog, a man in a yellow suit comes out of no where. My favorite part of the movie is when Miles and Jesse dressed up during the escaping of Mae and Tuck. I hope you will like the movie too."
3,Tuck Everlasting,"What appealed to me the most was the doomed love between the two main characters Winnie fell in love with a boy who kidnapped her. His name was Jesse Tuck and I have to admit he was a good looking boy. He had nice long hair but not to long. A few people were holding Winnie and Jesse's love apart. Miles Tuck was holding their love apart because he lost his beloved wife and 2 children and he was very jealous. It was very emotional when the constable stole Winnie away from Jesse, it gave me a tear. I thought Winnie and Jesse were wonderful actors. I would watch that movie over and over and I would love it every time I watched that movie. If you like mysterious and romantic movies this is the movie you really need to watch."
3,Tuck Ever lasting,Fantastic just fantastic I loved the movie of Tuck Ever lasting. If you like love and being excited it's definitely for you. The exciting part is the jail break. That you have to see. Jesse and Miles come with swords to the jail house and scare the police. Now the love part is what you will like. Jesse Tuck and Winnie Foster fall in love and love each other every minute. The best love scene of love is the Eiffel Tower part. You will like it. Now that you know about the movie go on and watch it then. Believe me watch it.
3,The original 1981 film adaptation was better,"I wish the original version was on DVD. It is the one I grew up on as part of my school reading program (We read the book, then the teacher would show the film. Saw it in both Junior High and High School, every year due to the quality and the very good adaptation of the book). This version is one that is not quite as good, it strays from the original novel too much. If you ever get a chance to watch the original film (only available on VHS according to IMDB), and read the original novel you will find a much better story. This is a disgrace to the writer, it is entertaining, but it is ""Tuck Everlasting"" in words only and in basic plot. The original 1981 film is much much more closer to the novel. This is an obviously ""Disneyfication"" of a wonderful book (more of a ""Reader's Digest Condensed Book"" version without the quality of ""Reader's Digest""."

All experienced players thoroughly grounded in the sometimes elusive ways to establish and maintain a smooth groove...has all of the bases covered in the area of good time, jumping rhythm & blues."""
1,Hard to get through!,"I bought this cd because I like their father's music so much, and i'm sure that's the last reason they would want for attracting an audience, but that's the reality! The cd has its moments but i found the music fairly weak and , truthfully, never listened to the whole thing! It is somewhat raw and poorly produced; they really can't sing - i found myself cringing in embarrassment for them on many songs. Their acclaim from better reviewers than I, is their simple, back to basics, no-fluff approach to songwriting, but I simply find their songs weak and leaning on a 'we'll do what we like in the studio' approach - ala Lennon in his early plastic-ono days; except they don't have the credentials he did! The Webb Bros. need to polish their act a bit... they do have the talent, they need to work on the craftsmanship of songwriting; perhaps reading their father's book may help!!"
4,Moen Modern Double Towel Bar,"The bar has nice simple lines and the towel bar curves out which adds interest. It is not a heavy look, so if you are looking for something thick and substantial, this is not for you. The acrylic accents add interest."
3,Design Flaw,"I purchased this double towel bar for my master bath remodel. Honestly, I chose this one mainly because of the lower price tag and the fact that it was chrome. While it looks very nice, and is easy to install, I would not recommend this towel bar. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I think it's perfectly sturdy once secured in to studs or wall anchors. My problem with the bar is that it does not allow enough space to hang two full size bath towels. Perhaps two hand towels--yes easily, or two washcloths. Not however, two large bath towels. The bars are simply too close together to allow for enough spacing. This is my fault because I chose cheap over value. If you want a good double towel bar, be prepared to spend about $40-50. Not a lot if you plan to utilize it everyday."
2,Typical Christian Manifest Destiny Attitude,I just heard an interview with Douglas Peck on my local NPR station. I would not read his books. His attitude that converting native americans to christianity was helping the native people is ridiculous. His statements regarding the missions of Ponce de Leon and Columbus being for the benefit and well being of the people they raped and murdered because they refused to convert to their religion were pompous and arrogant. I would not support this author in any way.
5,Mesmerizing,"It's been about ten years since I walked into a music store and heard something totally different being played in the store. I asked the clerk what was that incredible music they were playing. He said it was ""Enigma."" Now, ten years later, I am still just as much in love with Enigma as I was when I first heard that incredible music.Finally, with ""Enigma - Remember The Future"" I can see visual interpretations of the music. The videos are beautiful, spell binding, and mesmerizing.This DVD is TRULY a must-have for any fan of Enigma. And for those that have not yet experienced Enigma, you will more than likely be drawn into the Enigma mystique as I was ten years ago."
3,Excellent visuals to match excellent music :-),"I was living in Europe when Enigma's first album was released, so I have been a fan from the group's beginning. ""Remember the Future"" only strengthens my interest in the group and enjoyment of its great music. Especially when seen in order at once, the videos presented are truly amazing, although the same visual effects are used repeatedly throughout.The reason this is rated so low is the audio. The DVD cover states that Dolby Stereo was used in the recording of the DVD, but the high-end sound distortions are horrible, and the voiceover in the Facts section is often very difficult to understand due to the nasty audio. Those who can set this aside in the music videos, however, will truly enjoy the experience that is Enigma."
3,NOT SURE,"Enigma, especially this CD version, is my favorite.However, the DVD, while entertaining is not up to it's sister CD.After watching 1/2 of the DVD, turned it off and will look at another day (perhaps)"
5,Wish There Was More Like This,"These are just great videos (altho some are greater than others, naturally). Moving art.Some special effects were way ahead of their time.My favourites are Beyond The Invisible and Return To Innocence.I wish Enigma had more videos and would release them on another disc like this. that is, apart from the MCMXC ad the complete album dvd. The only other video that i can find out there is Voyageur, and that's on youtube. If there's more, tell me! but in the meantime, buy this dvd, no enigma collection is complete without it."
5,enigma love,I love Enigmas music. Naturally I love this Dvd. I am totaly satisfied with my purchase and with Amazon! Thank You
3,Nice and bad,"I buy this title after get the videos from Deep Forest and Enya. Those of Deep Forest and Enya are very artistic. Enigma is one of my prefered groups, and I really love their videos from Enigma 1, Enigma 2, Beyond the Invisible and Push the Limits. I dislike the video from TNT from the brain because the video really gave a too dark message and destroy my interest in that song, wich I used to consider lovely. Gravity of love is the next. For me the uggliest video of all times. I think there is no reason to offend chuches the way it does. The video is beastie and into the spirit of dark rituals of a non human world. I prefer the director of the Enigma 2 songs, more in the spirit of other enigmatic artist who gave us art in their videos. Because those 2 videos I decided to give Enigma DVD only 3 stars, even that the rest of the videos are 5 stars. I miss Out from the Deep. That would be a best video than that new one for me and uggly TNT fro the brain."
1,Big Disapointment,The videos are [weak]. The videos don't provide any mystery. For instance in one video you see a drum being hit when in the music there is a drum sound. They even show people lip syncing. Where's the mysterious story or visuals? Where's the creative camera work? Enigma's music is rich with many layers but you don't get that with the videos. Get the Moby DVD. Moby's Mega Mix is magnitudes better that this DVD.
4,Exactly what fans wanted...,"Enigma certainly lives up to its name. Aside from their albums and singles, not much can be seen or heard. American radio won't play them, American TV won't show their videos. However Enigma is one of the greatest musical creations ever. This collection of videos is exactly what fans have been waiting for. An extra glimpse into the ethereal world of this innovative group. Some of these videos are superb, others are just okay. But what some of the videos lack, the music more than makes up for it. The only things wrong with this video are the fact that it leaves out one of the best Enigma songs ever...""Out From The Deep"". It's very peculiar that this one video is missing. Also, the US DVD will never be released with ""Turn Around"" from the Love Sensuality Devotion album. But bottom line, any fan of Enigma must have these videos. Watch for a release of MCMXC a.D. - The Complete Video Album coming to DVD Sept. 8, the same as the release date for the new album, Voyageur!!"
3,"Great visuals, poor audio","I love Enigma and was highly anticipating the release of this DVD. The music videos (most of which I had never seen before) are stunning visual landscapes that transport the viewer into different cultures and realms in time. The audio on the disc, however, is seriously lacking. When I first bought the disc, I noticed loud static and ""popping"" in the audio soundtrack. I thought the disc was damaged, so I took it back and exchanged it. However, the audio problems remained. If Virgin Records had payed more attention to the audio details, this would definitely have been a five star DVD."
2,Wayne Newton meets a three arm'd comic,"Sounds like the premise to a bad joke.Even worse, it's the premise behind 100 minutes of my life that I'm never going to get back.Plus Bill Paxton on the accordian.(shudder)"
1,"Bad, bad, BAD movie","This is honestly the worse movie I have ever seen in my life. I like cult movies, but if you are honestly considering buying this movie, PLEASE, please, please, rent this bad boy first. Not to give away the plot, not that that could possible effect your enjoyment of the film, but Bill Paxton's character licks a dead body in a junk yard, and it's not even the sickest part of the movie. Oh, and it is not funny either, or interesting. WORST MOVIE EVER! Please don't buy this movie. `nough said."
5,"Garbagemen, midgets, Wayne Newton, Oh My!","This is one of my favorite movies of all time, even though very few people have ever seen it. I consider it a guilty pleasure. A garbageman named Marty who aspires to be a comedian (but isn't at all funny) develops a physical deformity that makes him a hit (but he still isn't funny). The bad jokes are bad enough that you have to laugh. And the cast includes a lot of people you know in roles that are unlike anything you've ever seen them do. For example, James Caan plays an inept doctor who sees the arm growing out of Marty's back and puts a small bandage on it. My favorite is Bill Paxton as the perpetually filthy accordion-playing garbageman sidekick named Gus who likes his women large and will eat anything. Don't watch it right after a meal..."
2,Mickey Mote is SLOOOOOOOOW.,"Great idea, thought the grandkids would love the interactive mode of the new AMickey Mote DVD's. Two different kids (and the adults helping) were so disappointed that the interactive mode is so slow that the kids gave up - one just left and the other threw the remote at the TV."
2,Great Idea...Poor Execution,"This was a gift to our 4 year old for her birthday. She absolutely loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and to think she would be able to participate in the show, was just icing on the cake. That is until we couldn't get the Mickey Mote to work. No matter how many times we programmed it, reset it, removed/replaced the batteries, it just would not work. Now we are forced to use the regular remote while she pretends the Mickey Mote works. Sad. For the record we have a Sony Blu-Ray player."
3,The Mickey Mote wouldn't work with any of our TV's,"The video is good, but a little frustrated that the mickey mote won't work. My girls were anxiously waiting to play with it, and now it's just a toy in the toy bin."
1,Mickey Mote doesn't work. My 3 year old was really looking forward to using it!,We tried my son's new Mickey Mote on several DVD remotes. It did not work! Very dissappointed. Would like another one that works!!!
3,Just ok,"My daughter who is 3 is not a big fan on this DVD. I don't blame her, rounding the numbers is not that entertaining."
5,My son loves Mickey!,My son is a true Mickey Mouse Clubhouse fan! These movies will keep my one year old son's attention the entire time it is on! He watched this on a 16 hour car ride and didn't complain about the length of the trip once!
4,A good ole' fashioned type cop movie...,"This movie is one of the best new releases I've seen this year. A good ole' fashion cop story...Kurt does a great job portraying a hard old school cop who takes no gruff from the bad guys, his ultimate goal is to see them go down no matter by what means. As usual Kurt Russell comes through with a good flick...be sure to see 3000 Miles to Graceland too!!"
4,good overall,"apart from the immplausible premise of those cops having a policy to not take suspects alive and getting away with it and the confession scene at the end, this movie was about as good as training day. a standard amount of extras on the dvd."
3,Again weak third act,"The problem with films today doesn't seem to be actors abilities to convey the material but the material actually being strong enough to be worthy of a movie.Russell sort of disintegrates-lite as a rogue cop and Rhames spends most of his time being righteous and trying to figure out a way to capture him. The LA riots as a backdrop was a nic etwist but this bad cop--kinda good cop who's lost his way film has played on for too long. The big suprirse of the film is that Russell's character doesn't die at the end. Generally there's a triumphant fatal ending that redeems the bad cop in some way but instead Russell admits his crimes.Michelle Michael is very strong here as well as Khandu Alexander but the third act of the film seems to be locked in by the choice of Russell coming clean or dying. Perhaps cop movies have been segmented by so many other films that it's hard to find an original spin on the ""impossible job---must become as dirty as those you hunt"" premise."
2,Dull Blue,"Too bad too. Real potential. Balancing the actual story and then revealing the actual King case at the same time as the movie story was great. Ving was good. Kurt was fine. Kurupt was actually good also but everything else was hammy, silly, and overblown. The end was laughable, the relationship with Kurt and his wife was weak at best, and the overall script choices / direction is for the most part simply ridiculous. The partnership between Kurt and his young partner is better done in Training Day. The crossover plot choice is far better in Out of Sight. Even Kurt is better in Breakdown than in this movie. It was a fun rental, but just too implausible to watch more than once. Heck, I even enjoyed Unlawful Entry more than this, get that instead."
2,"Great cast, implausible plot and a lousy script.","Director Ron Shelton hasn't had much luck lately. A few months before the shocking failure of his Hollywood Homicide there was the largely ignored Dark Blue.I really wanted to like this film, but despite a cast list that includes Kurt Russell, Ving Rhames, Michael Michele, Brendan Gleesan, Khandi Alexander, Jonathan Banks and Lolita Davidovich, Dark Blue is severely crippled by some very laughable plot developments and an abandance of unimaginative dialogue. The script ruins any possible opportunity for a good performance and Shelton's direction is heavy handed throughout.For a better executed look at LAPD corruption take a look at Charles Burnett's sober 1995 drama titled The Glass Shield."
1,One of the worst I have seen,"I would like to mention firstly that Russell's perfomance was great, and was the only reason I didn't pull the plug on my dvd player half way thru this awful movie.When I sit down to watch a movie, I don't want to be preached at. The same politically correct formula is growing tiresome. In this case mean white hetro-sexual male cops form the good ole boys club. The movie actually goes as far as to insuate the LA riots (a true incedent) are related to the corrupt LA police force (a ficticous incedent per the lame movie).When watching a rented movie I would like a little more depth of plot. This drivel could have aired on and ABC Wednesday night movie....shallow and predictable.I you want a good lesson on how corrupt law enforcement is, and the only reason we have crime is because the criminals (rioters) have been victimized by the evil establishment this movie will spell that out for you. If you would rather watch something more intelligent steer clear of this one."
4,Not bad,"This movie is yet another cop movie with the grizzled vetern (Kurt Russell) who will do whatever it takes to take down the bad guy saddled with new, younger, and more idealistic partner (Scott Speedman). Narc, Street Kings, and Training Day all come to mind as having similar vibes. Kurt Russell brings a certain likeability to his character though, and in these kinds of movies I always root for the cop who blows away the most bad guys. The standard conflict between the partners ensues, and things escalate to the almost predicable resolution. If it wasn't for Kurt Russell, this would only get 3 stars."
3,THIS IS BASICALLY ANOTHER ''TRAINING DAY'',"IT'S BASICALLY A RIP-OFF OF ''TRAINING DAY''. A YOUNG COP IS TAUGHT THE HARSH REALITIES OF THE STREETS BY HIS NEW RUTHLESS PARTNER [KURT RUSSELL]. A FAR CRY FROM ''TRAINING DAY'', BUT, THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT A BAD MOVIE. HAS A STRONG PERFORMANCE FROM KURT RUSSELL AND HAS SOME GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES. THE THING THAT KINDA HURTS THIS MOVIE IS ITS SOMEWHAT DISSAPOINTING SECOND HOUR. BUT, IT RECOVERS FROM THE MEDIOCRITY ONCE IT GETS TO THE LAST 20 MINUTES. NOT ONE OF RUSSELL'S BEST, BUT IT'S WORTH SEEING."
1,Typical cop-hating flick,"First of all, if you've already seen L.A. Confidential, skip this movie, because it's just a cheap rip-off of it. The only difference is that there's no mystery about it -- everything is completely straightforward, and the audience just waits for the disgusting characters to figure it out.The first thing that made me angry about this film was its use of the Rodney King incident. I can't express how disgusted I am that this is continually used to show the ""corruption"" of police officers in our society. Of course what we didn't see was Rodney King fighting the cops, but since it's now frowned upon in our society for police officers to defend themselves, especially if the person attacking them is black, it's no surprise that the cops involved have all been made out to be Gestapo.If you enjoy movies that insinuate that all white cops are crooked, bribe-taking, evidence-planting murderers, then please rent this film. Otherwise, avoid it at all costs."
3,I hope this one takes Russell into the first league again.,"The great news about this movie is that I hope it will take Kurt Russell to his well-deserved place among Hollywood's first echalon stars, a place he lost gradually due to unknown factors and some bad movie choices (3000 Miles For Graceland, for example..... His performance here is really top.The movie in itself is not bad by any means, it's technically very good, but it's also no big deal. We've seen it before."
3,Decent Crime Drama,"Watching this film, one can't help but feel that Kurt Russell is miscast as a corrupt cop. That issue aside, DARK BLUE is a decent character study of a cop on the edge. It's kind of ""TRAINING DAY LIGHT.""Set just before the 1992 Los Angeles uprising, it touches on familiar issues regarding police officers going beyond the law. You've seen it before and probably done better, but the film is by no means a failure.The story is familiar, but moves with a few thrills and plot twists. Ving Rhames and Michael Michele give good performances as do most of the cast.It's not edge of your seat suspence, but it is a good time filler for those who like crime dramas. After it's brief theatrical run, DARK BLUE has found its home on video."
4,Great Acting By Kurt Russell,"What I got from this movie is not what I expected. I expected to get an action filled movie with car chases and gunfights. Instead I got a drama filled film about a corrupt cop, played by Kurt Russell, whose life is falling apart before his eyes and he doesnt even realize it! this was a good movie, they just did a bad job at advetising it! It came across a one thing but they gave you another. Overall Kurt Russell plays his part to the key, he was great... along with other supporting actors and a decent story line I give this film 3 stars, but plus 1 for Russells performance."
3,Good Cop Drama,"I thought this movie was well made. I expected more action, but it had a decent plot with surprising twists, and good acting. I recommend that you rent it before you buy."
4,The forecast calls for pain....,"As I watched the grim Dark Blue I thought ""this is like a James Ellroy novel"".There are many fine things about Dark Blue but if you believe as the folks at eBay say ""People are basicly good"" you'll be in for a big dissapointment. The movie does try to eek out a ""nice"" ending but the message is clear--Everything is NOT going to be alright.Suffice to say Dark Blue makes Prince of the City and Serpico look like the Rugrats movie. Let's just hope its just well written fiction--because, take away the pretty faces and it sure seems real."
3,Interesting Look at Corrupt Cops,"""Dark Blue"" is a film set during the time of the Rodney King verdict in Los Angeles in 1992. The story revolves around Kurt Russell, a crooked cop who preys on the ""scum"" of the streets. He has no problem killing people whom he thinks is not contributing to society, esepcially in South Central L.A. Kurt Russell teaches his young, impressionable partner the ins and outs of his job and how he gets things done - doctoring evidence, blaming innocent people, killing innocent people, the list goes on and on. It isn't until Kurt Russell's character realizes that his theories aren't what make a good cop and discovers that other his collegues are out to get him, that he finally tries to make a turnaround.Some scenes in this movie tended to be a little slow and you found yourself wanting to move along with the movie a lot faster than it was. Overall, it's a pretty good movie."
5,Great Movie,"Kurt Russell dose not get the credit he deserves for this movie and a lot of others, this movie shows a side of him I've never seen. This is a must see!"
2,Weakest Product of the Conflicted Cop Genre,"Since ""Training Day"" everybody has wanted to make a ""conflicted LA cop"" product. Training Day was good because of the strength of the dialogue and Denzel Washington's on-screen presence. Dark Blue puts an interesting twist on the genre by setting the story during the L.A. riots, but it still fails to deliver.1) The writing just isn't there, the dialogue is not as snappy as Training Day.2) The movie is utterly predicable. I mean ""bad cop with a good heart teamed up with a young idealistic partner"", we've seen it all before.3) The riots play a very minor role in the movie.This movie sounds and feels like an extra long episode of FX's ""The Shield,"" and while Dark Blue would work on television it just doesn't deliver the goods on the big screen."
4,Best CD I've bought in months!,"This CD is great. It blows away all those radio bands that are being rammed down our throat. Hard, driving, melodic and original. ROCK N ROLL!!!"
4,common sense,There's nothing here that I hadn't tried or already thought of. Mostly common sense stuff.
3,A Pretty book but flawed,"Read without knowledge of the other Indian based accounts available; this is an interesting book. There are other books available also which are based on Indian accounts and seem more coherent. This book is pretty and interesting but adds very little to a serious student of the event. Some of the vignettes are interesting when compared with other indian accounts and blended with them. The story of Custer sitting around at Weir point while Reno's battalion was being routed is not well placed in time or detail. In short, the book is a quick and easy read. It is an interesting contrast to the ""old"" accounts of the Little Big Horn saga. In light of other recent works on the subject; it is a lightweight."
3,"Interesting, but. . .","I wished I had known (should have read the reviews!) that this is a coffee table attempt to deal with an extremely complicated subject. The pretty pictures and artwork were fine, but the book claims to have important historical information from the Crow scouts. When I read (reread and reread) the accounts, I was no closer to understanding what happened. Indeed, one descendant of the Crow scouts admitted that the versions of the events told to him by the scouts were not the same.The book's strength is in its modern work at the site. The articles about what items were found at both sites with metal detectors (a whole horse!) was fascinating and worth the purchase price. For instance, that bullets with the same rifling were found all over the Custer battle site is fascinating. I hope more metal detector search can be done."
2,A book that easiy can be forgotten.,"There was a big disappointment in this book. It told me nothing new; the subjects covered have all been covered elsewhere, and very few Indian stories from the time of the battle are retold. Also, the physical size of the book, 9x12, is a mark against it, making it clumsy to handle and read unles you have a flat table to rest it on. On the plus side, though, it contains many photographs of the combatants, some which are rarely seen."
2,Like Watching Paint Dry in the Dark,"I stuck with this dark, sluggish movie in the hopes I would learn something about its main character and that it would actually go somewhere...anywhere. Alas, it went nowhere, I got fed up with the protagonist, and the ending was a fitting cop-out. Skip it."
1,"Dull, man had cart, worked hard and lost it the END!","The movie was about a man that faced many of lifes problems because of the loss of his wife and not being able to support his son. He worked hard, bought a cart, lost it, the end. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE GIVEN THIS A -1 STAR!"
1,Don't waste your $,"I have been using stretching and exercising videos for several years and add to my collection about four times a year. This is the worst I have ever purchased and wish I could return it!These are seven different 3-minute routines for first thing in the morning to get you moving. That SOUNDS just fine. In reality, it seems to be a show for what Ann Smith can do. If you have a serious background in ballet, you MIGHT enjoy this video. Otherwise, I suggest you keep on searching.The instruction is limited to quickly watching her do the routine and then following along with her as best as you can. Perhaps, after a while one gets the idea of the movements.The presentation tone of the movement is VERY serious indeed. I suggest you research this one carefully before purchasing it."
5,Better than a cup of coffee!,"I really enjoyed this video. I am very sluggish in the mornings and don't really have the time for a full workout because of my hectic schedule. What was so appealing to me about this video was that there was a short segment for each morning that I could find time to complete before rushing out the door. It gives me the extra pick-up that I need before a long day at work. Also, I really liked the fact that I didn't need to rewind the tape after I was finished with my segment for the day. I thought the concept behind the video was very clever and perfect for my lifestyle. Thanks Ann!"
5,David Cassidy could really sing and Lori was Hot!!!,"I liked all of season four, what makes this show fun is that the actors, aside from David never hid the fact that they could not play music. Unlike the Monkees everyone could play and sing, the Partridges just looked like they were having fun, and the music is great. ""Walking in The Rain"" from thier ""Notebook"" album, is excellent. It also goes to prove that David Cassidy was an excellent singer. Plus looking at Susan Dey was a highlight of my day when I saw it aon television. The comedy duo and somtimes trio of Reuben, Danny and Keith is legendary. In the last episode fo the season when they are trying to to hide from the mystery writer, Reben's exchange with Shirley is great. ""Shirley can I give him one little hit""? Can't wait for Season four. Ok, fellow fans I have all theri cd's and I still listen to them. Fess up who else does as well?"
2,Changes,"I didn't grow up watching the Partridge Family (it was before my time) but have loved watching the first 3 seasons. I found season 4 to have a very different feel to it. In part due to the annoying Ricky addition, and in part to the other various changes that happened. Each of the characters had a slightly different appearance while they had remained (for the most part) consitent. The other very large change, was their home. It appeared to have gone throught a complete remodel. Changes are not a bad thing, but when all of those changes happen at once, it causes a feeling of detachment from the viewer and the show.I will be watching seasons 1-3 over again, but will skip 4."
4,The last Season,"I loved the Partridge Family as a kid growing up.This was the final season and was up against the powerhouse of the era, All in the Family!!!!How could the Partridges compete! The downfall this last season was introducing the annoying kid Ricky!Maybe keeping the show still on Friday nights may have saved it from cancellation??????"
1,Get a Barney Video Instead,I so love the Partridge Family but this final season ends each episode with the new 5 year-old character singing a song instead of a Partridge pop song. So don't get it unless you're prepared for tooth-achingly sweet songs sung by an unbelievably cute kid instead of the cheesy pop you love.
4,brings nack the good times,As a younger person I used to watch this show when ever it was on to see it again brings back simpler times in my life so to me this was a great investment in happiness
4,partridge family,thought it was a good dvd picture and sound is good only watch just few shows i notice the picture is a little bright maybe its my tv other then that give it 4 stars
2,Glad to see this on dvd.,"Even though this is not one of the better seasons of the Partridge Family, I still enjoy watching it and listening to the music that is on this dvd. I am glad to have this series on dvd and recommend it highly.This show brings back a lot of good memories from my childhood."
4,Extra Cast Members Destroy a Good Thing,"Any die-hard Patridge Family Fan, as my son and I are, have to have the fourth season to complete the library. But, as with all sit-coms, it seems that they start messing around with the formula that works and end up with a jump the shark scenario. In this case, the shark is a annoying singing neighbor child in the form of Ricky Segall. At the end of every episode, he comes over to the Partridge House to sing a song. YUCK!!!!! Some people may find this extremely cute (the montage of the Partridges find them smiling happily and laughing) but I am not one. He destroys the show for me and I find myself fast-forwarding over these parts. Other than that, they are great. Keith is in college, Reuben has a moustache, Laurie is still as socially aware as always, and Shirley is simply fabulous. Not as good as the others because of the addition of Ricky but still great."
5,Satisfied,Really nice quality ribbon for the price! I used this to seal gift baskets in cello bags for the holidays. The ribbon looks and curls great!
3,Mafia -,"The LAST DON ( both parts ) is a good movie , but not as strong as you expect like the GODFATHER or GOOD FELLAS , but still it is a good way of spending twenty some dollars ....."
5,Great Mafia 90's Epic!,Great sequel...Mario Puzo really knows how to depict the life of a mobster in a 90's kind of way...Great drama and action...Perhaps the greatest Mafia duo movies I've ever scene...part one is great as well!
3,"Part one was great, this one...","The main problem with this movie is the music. They have put loud music on top of the dialogues, so often it is impossible to understand what the actors are saying!!!The plot is ok, although you do not understand why Giorgio would want to leave the job of Don to Crocefisso, and not take it for himself.Next it is not really clear why Crocefisso came back from Paris at all. If I understood it correctly, at the beginning of the movie Don Clericuzio only said that he missed him. Not that he wanted him back. But, again the music was covering the dialogues, and so I migh have misunderstood."
3,Suffers in Comparison to the Godfather,"The Last Don just does not have any of the depth of the Godfather. While entertaining, I found it somewhat irritating. The characters are believable, but flat.I think the movie does give the viewer a sense of menace which is not easy to film.I can only rate the movie as adequate."
3,"Good, although not as good as the first one.","Jason Gedrick is great. He does a good job of being a good-Bad guy. He does what he does without wanting to do it. I like the loyalty of Liavasi(msp). If you bought the first one, buy this one to complete the set."
4,Over-priced,"I enjoyed the movie as I saw it on TV. Why, however, would I pay $25 for it, when I got the entire God Father Trilogy, including extras - 4 discs, for $34.95 at Target?"
1,Slightly less entertaining than root canal surgery,"Anyone rating this movie more than one star needs to have their head examined. Mario Puzo is turning over in his grave, having his name associated with this ""movie"". There is a good possibility that the screenplay was written by the 4-year-old autistic girl Bethany. The terms ""plot"", ""transition"" and ""cohesion"" are clearly not in the writer's vocabulary. 127 minutes of my life that I will never be able to get back."
4,mobsters movies,a must have one of the best mario puzos story he never wrote a bad story just buy it with trust
3,More guitar-driven industrial music.,"I'd first heard of Nihil when I was living in Arizona (where I believe they're from) and I'd heard them being compared to KMFDM. Well, that's sort of true. They've got the heavy beats, loud guitar riffs, and loads of samples...but they're no KMFDM. I suppose that the comparison stands insofar as if you like indutrial-metal bands like KMFDM, Nine Inch Nails, or Ministry, you would probably enjoy Nihil on some level. Personally, I think that they lack the clout of those other bands."
5,Anyone wanna buy a field emmission display?,"I have cherished the memory of those original Putt's Law Research/Development Magazine articles ever since the mid 1970's. Imagine my surprise and delight to discover that the Putt's Law techn-wisdom of the ages was revised, extended, and made widely available in this book. No pointy-headed PHDs; no dry analysis; no go-go pop psychology; no insufferable self-help tome here! Just real observations that bring simultaneous deep chuckles and bitter-sweet memories. Damn, ain't the unvarnished truth a hoot sometimes?"
4,Some excellent insights...,"Not really what is was hyped to be, but VERY informative from my perspective being a technologist."
1,Return to Me,"I was excited to purchase Return to Me, as it was advertised as having closed captions in English. It does not. Closed captions ony in foreign languages. The film was of no use to me, so I gave it away.MB"
2,Could have been great,"This had the potential to be a great movie. As Hollywood is wont to do, it was spoiled by profanity, using the Lord's name in vain, indecent attire, and unnecessary references to sex. Why do the married couples always have to be bickering and screaming? The plot was sweet and the acting was very good, but all the aforementioned left a very bad taste in my mouth, and left me feeling like I just wasted two hours of my life. It is an old PG I guess. I would definitely give it a PG-13."
4,Underappreciated Songwriting Genius,"It's so strange that Cockburn, winner of multiple Junos (the Canadian equivilant of our Grammys) would be virtually unknown here in the U.S. He's one of the best songwriters of our day, intelligent, thoughtful, provocative lyrics abound. He's played the role of the hippy love-child, the religious zealot and, on this recording, the political activist. His songs about the violence in Latin America are heart wrenching, he puts a very real face on the horrors encountered there. Listen to the sincerity in his voice when he sings songs like 'If I Had a Rocket Launcher', it sounds as though he really could fire the rocket. This is not a recording for background music at dinner, it's a political manifesto, and it is powerful stuff."
5,Simply excellent. Cockburn really hits the mark here,"Bruce Cockburn has really made some great albums, but this is the best (next to Resume, but I can't seem to find that). I absolutely adore this record, especially the first track, but it is all very accesable; a delight for the senses."
4,As advertised,"Not one of Bruce Cockburn's better albums, but it is listenable. ""Charity of Night"" & ""Nothing but a Burning Light"" are far superior."
4,Worked very well on VW Bug convertible,"Based on reading other reviews, I purchased this to clean mildew stains off a tan canvas convertible top on a 2006 VW Beetle. At first I tried spraying an area then rubbing off with a terry cloth towel. That didn't to work too well.Then I sprayed an area, let it set for about a minute, then scrubbed it with a medium bristle brush, then rinsed it with a high powered nozzle. After it dried, it actually looked much better. So I recommend it for convertible tops!"
2,Save your money.,"I expected a lot more for the price. I figured I would give it a try since I have used Meguiars on my cars and the polishes have always been good. To be blunt, the stuff I eventually made for about $1.25 worked better. The spray bottle was .99 of that. You can easily make better cleaners with household chemicals for far, far less. I'm not going to give a recipe here but it's easy, cheap and works better. I was looking for a silver bullet and we all know that's a myth."
4,Inspired by the movie,"This cook book is a very good resource for learning how to cook french food and it goes in to the details on how you can go wrong and even how to correct your mistakes.Just try the recipes, they're delicious, for example I tried one chocolate cake recently, what a taste.I was inspired by the movie Julia & Julie. So after seeing this movie within one hour I ordered the book :D.Only thing it lacks are images. But if you don't mind that the pictures are few and want to learn about cooking with Julia Child just buy it."
4,The first one with new techology,"The 1983 edition was the update to the original primer on French cooking by Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle. It was the first book on doing French cooking using technology, new methods for old recipes - using a food processor, pre-sifted flour, different melting for chocolate that had changed characteristics, and so on. Not only is this a classic, but it is still usable!"
4,Great delivery time and very good source of recipes.,"The book arrived very quickly. I was a bit disapointed as it is a paperback, thought I had ordered the hard cover version, but that was a mistake on my part. At any rate the movie ""julie and julia"" prompted me to purchase the book. It is very good. Made Boeuf Bourguignon the 2nd day after receiving the book and it turned out awsome!."
4,Fast delivery,"I bought this book after seeing the movie. I was impressed with the delivery time that was so quick despite it came from america to UK. The content of the book is presented in original way, hand sketch diagrams and type writer fonts."
3,Swimming Lessons in Butter,"This was in a movie recently, right? I have no one to attend movies with, but that sounds right. A Meryl Streep movie.I don't cook much. I'm a vegetarian, in fact. Usually. Although I like duck. And I LOVE butter. Julia (and those other women) luxuriates in butter, long, purposeful, arduous afternoons of preparing meat in butter and cheese. I cooked one thing (crepes; I have no stomach for stuffing live lobster into boiling water, don't they fight back?). Lovely, if flat. A little greasy, with the butter. For the dedicated, but not the lonely. Her food is meant for groups, for couples. I had no one to cook for."
1,This book was sloppily printed.,I should have sent this back because there were sections that were askew and pages that were not cut properly.
2,Looks interesting,"I bought this book because I was a big fan of Julia Child's cooking show and because of the movie Julie/Julia. I haven't cooked anything yet, but I feel like I am getting a good education in how to proceed in the right direction. One of my friends made a fish dish from this cookbook and I loved it. The thing is that I do not like fish and here I was enjoying a delicious fish dish. He made a six course dinner, and when I asked how he became such a good cook he recommended this book. If I can become a good cook like he is then it was worth buying this book."
5,Should be in every kitchen,"What a great cook book, and what a great lady. Bought from Amazon for my wife, so no worries here. Delivered on time. Hardback. Best deal was Amazon. Wife loves it and she uses it often."
5,Excellent!,"Great book, the book is a present to my sister and i took a look, has many things to learn from.Great content."
4,Cookbook review,"This book is excellent in many ways, not only has Julia collated an amazing series of dishes she has captured the fundamental art of French cuisine, added to this snippets off history about the art and the dishes she presents, it's a tremendous read."
5,Absolutely the best!,"I received this book as a gift almost 30 years ago, when I was a bachelor simply trying to figure out which end of an egg is up! Now I am married with two grown kids and a fairly accomplished cook, having taking over those duties upon my retirement from the military. I have 40 or 50 cookbooks, including Bon Apetit, Amer. Culinary Institute, and all the other classics. But this Mastering the Art of French Cooking is number one on my list. Every step of the way, this is first book I consult when trying to figure out the best way to cook something. Buy it as a gift for an aspiring cook--it will be the cookbook they will refer to the most!"
5,Mastering the art of French Cooking by Julia Childs,"The book is in excellent condition, and I am very pleased with it.Thanks Amazon"
3,Not What I Expected,"I was so excited to get this cookbook after watching my favorite movie - ""Julie and Julia"", but the formatting of the book really detracts from my enjoyment. The recipes run from one page to the next making flipping neccesary. No color photos to inspire, only sketches. The book may have been groundbreaking in 1961, but we have come a long way baby. Perhaps I need to just get in there and try some of the recipes, but without pictures I don't find myself inspired. Perhaps someone should re-visit this book and add photos and web based videos..."
2,smudges galore,"I bought this cookbook to give my mom for Christmas, as we'd both watched ""Julie & Julia"" multiple times and loved it. As a full time college student working part time for minimum wage, it was a bit of a splurge for me. Unfortunately, the copy I received has dirt-colored smudges all over the front of the paper jacket. It's really disappointing, as I don't have time to return it and get a new one (and what if the new one was dirty as well?), so I'm going to have to give my mom a besmudged cookbook for Christmas. I'm really frustrated by this."
3,It's just okay,"Very old type of book. I haven't used it...yet. I will use this book soon, but some of the recipes just seem difficult. if I would have known this beforehand I would have not purchased this book."
5,Classic Must Have,"This book is one of the must-haves in every person's kitchen, whether you are a good cook or not.It is very well organized with dishes clearly marked and easy to find not matter what you are looking for, from chicken, fish and meat to deserts.The instruction is very detailed and though lengthy, it ultimately results in dishes that work out well. I am an okay cook, not great, but these recipes wrok out well for me time after time."
4,Annie's review.,"This volume was purchased as a birthday treat for my daughter who read my original copy as a teenager and almost wore it out. She wishes to re-visit an old favourite and try the recipes. This book is written differently to other cook books with ingredients listed for each stage followed by instructions for each step, then the next group of ingredients. Some recipes seem a little involved, but step by step instructions are excellent and the end result is traditional cooking at its best."
4,A must-have for any serious home cook.,"Every serious home cook should have a good collection of Julia Child's recipes in the kitchen. Although many of the recipes are elaborate and time consuming, they are all clearly explained and easy to follow. I have never had a Julia Child recipe fail. I refer to this book constantly for basics such as pie crust. It is also my first line of defense for company meals."
5,Julia Childs cook book,"This book is excellent. I have used it and love it! Will continue to get many years of great recipes from it and best of all, it was written by Julia Childs!"
5,Gift item,This book was bought for my daughter yet everybody who is interested in good food and good cooking should have a copy.
4,a wonderful classic,"this book is and will most certainly always be, one of my favorite cook books. Of the handful of recipes I have randomly chosen, all have turned out very well. While it is a much older book and certain tools and methods therein described may be considered dated by today's standards-I love it! With just a little bit of prior basic cooking knowledge, this book could easily be anyone's favorite. A definite tried and true classic. You must try the potato leek soup! my husband dubbed it ""leaky potato,"" but for a typically ""meat and potatoes guy"" he actually loved it, once he was able to overcome the appearance that is."
5,Am I as good as Julia Child? No.,"Am I as good as Julia Child? The answer is always no. But, this cook book truly guides you to becoming a better cook. I have found that I understand cooking better for reading her recipes and her tutorials. I rarely need to look up cooking techniques on the internet because of her simplified step-by-step instructions. Written simply, and filled with amazing eats!"
5,A must have book for Julia Child fans.,After receiving this as a birthday gift for my wife she now has promised me a year of french meals taken from this book. I'll probably put on 15 more pounds but I'll enjoy each and every recipe she makes from this book.
5,Just what she wanted,"My daughter-in-law saw the movie and wanted to ""cook through the book."" She has already started using it and it very happy with her gift. I paired it with the Julie and Julia book which was a good plan."
5,A Must-Have Classic,"This is more than a classic cookbook. It is also a hands-on practicum for the home cook who wishes to improve both skills and palate. Rather than the standard recipe format, this book lists the ingredients in a column beside the instructs for using them. It is both lucid and fun to read, let alone use.While I'm not following the front-to-back attack found in the ""Julie & Julia"" story, I am using it as a master class text and allowing Julia to be my mentor."
3,"It was the beginning, but now we have the Food Network...","I like Julia Child. I often watch the repeats on PBS. I went to the movie openning weekend. I came home immediately after the movie and ordered her cookbook - and the companion ""Julia's Kitchen Wisdom"". I have great respect for Mrs. Child. She was a pioneer. But we've come a long way - fresh ingredients, better cookware and 'we' are less intimidated. Buy it as a 'read'. But if you want to master some french classics..buy the Barefoot Contessa's Barefoot in Paris. Easier and just as delicious."
5,5 stars for a 5 star lady,"This is the cookbook that formed the foundation for Julia Child's famous series ""The French Chef."" Some parts of this edition recognize the new appliances available since the book was published 25 years before, like the food processor. The recipes, however, are still classics. Although Julia apologizes in the foreword for being neither French nor a trained chef, it is this well-written, comprehensive cookbook that helped to change the way Americans eat. Although some of the recipes are a bit intimidating like entirely boning a chicken or duck, most are attainable. For the best quiche you've ever made - buy the crust if you can't bake - make Julia's recipe for this Lorraine classic."
5,Julia Child,"What can a person say about Julia Child that hasn't already been said. Love this cook book and have cooked some things from it. I can just hear her voice while I am reading the receipes. Good fast shipping, and shipping was reasonable."
5,A Master Work,"This is the second copy of this book that I bought since my original is in storage somewhere in Michigan. Julia is a master at telling you what to do as well as why to do it and how to recover from inevitable mistakes. Cooking her way does take us back to a time when people actually made time to cook. I enjoy taking the time to make the delicious dishes described in here. Many recipes are actually quite quick and they always lead me to try something new, which is the sure path to a more fulfilling experience in the kitchen. A master work."
5,INCREDIBLE BOOK!!!,"I have tons of cooking book, and they are just that... cooking books with all kind of receipes in them...BUT i wouldnt label this as a cooking book, ""Mastering the art of french cooking"" is so much more, it really provides you knowledge of the necessary techniques, and while you read it, you feel like you are learning so so much!I have try some receipes and i am telling you, they are so clear that even a kid could do them, and they are just so tasty!i strongly recommend this book to all those out there who like me... love cooking!"
4,Julia's cook book,"I am enjoying just reading the cookbook as it is more than just instructions for creating great french food, it is a whole story, even to what wines to accompany your meal.Easy to follow with plenty of interesting ingredients,so far my attempts at french cooking have been successful thanks to Julia."
5,Mastering the art of french cooking,"Book is exacially what I wanted. Although it was used, the book was in great shape and a great price."
5,THE BIBLE OF GOOD COOKERY,"I have referred to this cookery book - and its sequel, Volume II - for at least 15 years. The recipes contained therein have NEVER failed to satisfy my guests and myself - the latter being the more judgmental critic - and I have referred to the Master Recipes as a launchpad for a variety of culinary excursions. Julia gives the basics and allows you to use your inteligence and flair to improve upon the perfect. For this she has allowed all cooks and chefs and dilettantes cuisiniaires to express their experitise and originality.Tim Wingate from Ottawa CANADA"
3,uo la la,"it sure does have alot of receipes some seem to be alittle involved but it is a french cookbook, it became to be very hel[pful so we could try some french cooking before my daughter took her trip to france"
5,A very important part of any cookbook collection,For those of us who love French cooking this is a very important book to have. So much information clearly and precisely presented. You're given not just recipes but also techniques that you will use all during your cooking life. I find it absolutely indispensable. I've given several books as gifts to other friends who appreciate fine food beautifully made and lovingly presented.
5,My Rubachem Review -- Now I'm Hungry!,My Rubachem review of Mastering the Art of French Cooking is that it's a huge help for even beginners and that's no scam! Most books are for expert chefs but this is easy to understand. The movie is also awesome!!
5,Great Classic,"I am a decent cook, but I bought Mastering the Art of French Cooking to get even better. What makes this cookbook so great is that Julia Child explains how to cooking methods.I rarely follow any recipe exactly--I often look at several and make my own. With this cookbook, I am doing the same. No reason to use all the cream and butter. Substiute milk for cream, etc. Cook vegetables less.This is an invaluable cookbook both for the techniques and the classic French recipes."
5,Good story along with Receipes!,I bought this book for my wife and she enjoys the stories and the receipes.
5,Nirvana!,This book bring together years of cooking by recipe. It actually explains things so I can understand why I'm doing them.
3,automatic feeder,"Not user friendly-instructions unclear and not user friendly. I would also like to be able to adjust the portion sizes better. Once you figure out how to get it going, it works well. Holds a large amount of food."
3,Not as advertised,"I bought this because my cat needs to be fed small meals several times a day, and the feeder was advertised as able to feed as little as 1/4 cup at a time. Doesn't actually work that way. It feeds reliably at the right time, but at the lowest setting it gives at least 1/2 cup. That's a disappointment. Otherwise, I found it easy to use, and good quality."
4,Works fine,"I bought this product two weeks ago and I'm glad I made the purchase. The machine is alittle bulkly and not too difficult to program once you fully read the directions. My cat knows there is food there and he sticks his paw in to release some. After awhile he gives up when nothing comes out. He gets a little scared when it dispensing food because it is a little noisy. Other then those minor issues, it works fine."
2,Might be ok for cats...,"...but this device did not hold up for one day against my 9 year old, 20 lbs soaking wet Sheltie. I came home to discover she had knocked it around quite a bit so that the top part had come off, the food was eaten and the plastic cover over the control panel had been chewed. Perhaps the two stars should be assigned to my food crazed pet, but she's not exactly a junk yard dog.Programming the device was also very challenging and I'm almost always fine with that sort of thing. The instructions were poorly written and the steps counter-intuitive.The feeder did seem to work just fine when I did a trial run at dinner the night before leaving it alone with the dog while I was at work. As I said, this might work very well for cats. It simply isn't sturdy enough for many dogs, even of the smallish variety."
3,Works with issues,This product works as stated with some comments.1) It appeared to be broken when it is really just out of battery power. The little screen will still be lit but it won't dispense. If you replace the battries it will work again.2) The programming interface is not intuitive but if you have the instruction guide it works just fine. Don't lose it!3) It gobbles up batteries! I would suggest rechargeables.4) I agree that it dispenses really large portions. I only have one cat and once a day feeding on the lowest setting is enough.But I only have to worry about little Charlie once a month so it's a great product!
2,"Works Sometimes, But Hard to Program","Someone had a good idea, but the execution is poor. We bought one of these models from a catalog 6 months ago, but after some malfunctions, we returned it for an exchange. Unfortunately, the new unit is just as difficut to work and program.As someone mentioned, maybe your cats would have better luck getting this thing to work! The instructions are poor and the buttons used to set the programming just don't seem to work much of the time. Quite frustrating. When the unit works, it's good, but getting it to work correctly is most of the problem.The bottom line: We are going to try another product."
2,not worth it at all,"lots of people are complaining about the programming, which I found to be relatively straightforward. My problem with the machine is that it is meant to be used for consistent portion control, but it seems to drop out a random amount of food each time.The other problem is that my cat should be eating 2/3 a cup per day, and there's no way to program that amount in.. It only dispenses in 1/4 cup increments. which wouldn't be so bad - I could supplement with treats or something, except that as I said above, it doesn't seem to be measuring the amounts at all when a meal is dispensed. I have watched it spit out 5 kibbles, and another time it will drop nearly 3/4 cup."
4,Petmate Automatic Feeder,The programming is extremely counterintuitive. Once figured out it works great and is perfect for weekend getaways.
3,Maybe ok for some cats,"Programming is clunky, but works. But our cats quickly learned how to reach in and get a snack any time, so I had to tape a board on the front to make the opening smaller. Also there are too few choices for portions.. for us, ""1"" is too little and ""2"" is too much."
1,Another POC from China,"This is a good product in theory, since it feeds your cat at regular intervals so it doesn't get fat, but it is difficult to program, and my electronics went crazy after a few weeks. I wouldn't recommend this product. Maybe there's something better that's made in America."
2,Le Bistro,"It is too difficult to set the meals and times. Also, if you want to override the settings, you have to reset everything. If you turn it off, it loses the settings and you have to re enter everything."
4,Le Bistro Electronic Pet Feeder!,"Yes, this unit is a Pain in the A@@ to program! ...I have filed the instructions away in a safe place...Without them I would never manage to reset it when the batteries die!!!After the frustration of setting up the program....I do really like it!My fat dogs are now feed very regularly and never too much!For our retired lifestyle, ... this is a ""Good Thing"""
1,Sorry to say it really is a piece of junk...,"I guess some have been lucky, and others much more persistent than we are.I purchased two Le Bistro feeders for my two cats last week and they arrived yesterday.I have to say they're incredibility cheaply made! I was expecting a bit more for $50. The bowl doesn't detach for cleaning, and the feed container isn't even sealed! I put the batteries in the first one and it was dead out of the box. Not a good way to start.The second one powered up, but the instructions are horrible, and programming is a nightmare. I've just returned both of them and will be looking for another solution."
1,Just junk,"I agree with the other reviewers that programming is difficult. Losing all programming when you turn the unit off is inexcusable. I could deal with those problems, but the clock loses over an hour a day! Yes, I have fresh batteries. The unit has breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. However, there are limits as to the time you can select for the meals. Portion size is selectable, but is the same size for all meals. I wanted to have a larger portion in the morning and a smaller meal at night. The only way to do this is to assign 'lunch' a few minutes after breakfast, which can't be done. 'Lunch' can not be scheduled before noon. The workaround was to set the clock 12 hours out of sync. But with the problem of the terrible timekeeping, this thing is headed for the trash."
3,I actually works,"The feeder was surprisingly easy to use. It took a only a few minutes to setup and program. The feeder is well constructed with a smooth finish. The cat likes it. I will check back in a month with reliability and battery life rating. Only 3stars cause its new and I cannot rate its reliability.Its 2 months since I purchased this feeder and it works falwlessly. I am still using the same set of Duracell battries I installed 2 months ago. It does have some flaws, programming is not intutive, but its not difficult. Not much different than setting your car clock. My 18 year old cat likes the feeder and that all that really counts. I would upgrade my rating to 4 stars."
5,3 years and still going!,"This is a great unit. As others have mentioned, the programming is non-intuitive, and better directions have been posted online for setting this guy up. But once it's up and running it's awesome. I haven't even had to change the batteries yet and I bought this in 2007 (feeding about two meals a day)."
1,The worst product I have bought in 10 years,"One star is too much. The only thing worst than the design of the electronics was the instructions. I have programmed calculators, thermostats, security alarm systems, coffee makers, alarm clocks, stereos, and just about everything else, but this was impossible. The best part of the product was the sound it made hitting the bottom of my trash can."
2,Almost worthless...,"The first one I bought wouldn't turn on at all, so I had to exchange it. All went well with the second one for about 6 months and then wheel that releases the food just stopped working. It's just not worth the $60 to know whether if you leave your cats for a few days if they're going to starve. I'll never purchase a product from this company again, and will be taking a driving hammer to the old one just for fun, circa Office Space."
1,feedlady,"One star because it is the least allowed....Unit only went through the first set of batteries before it began to fall apart.... half of the cheap, thin plastic paddles used for dispensing are already MIA.Expensive piece of junk for what you get."
1,Le Bistro Pet Feeder,"We bought two Le Bistro pet feeders. One works fine. The other will not dispense. It does not work either in automatic or in manual. Very disappointing. The troubleshooting guide provides no guidance for the problem. I can't find a phone number to call for troubleshooting assistance, so I guess it's off to the post office to send it back."
5,easy convenient portion controlled feeder,"We got this feeder for our cats for Christmas. Of course when it arrived a week before, we had to put it together and start using it. Us and our cats love it. The cats are getting used to their feeding schedule, and I'm sure they will maintain their healthy weight, or even loose a pound or two. Even our three year old little girl gets excited when the it's time for the feeder to put out the food. She giggles and dances around. The timer took us a few tries to finally get it right, but once we got it figured out- it was very easy. I would recommend this product to any pet owner concerned with portion control or for anyone that is out of town a lot and wants the piece of mind that their beloved pet is getting the exact amount of food they need."
3,Same experience as many others,"The most notable feature of this product is the difficulty I had in getting it programmed correctly. I discovered that it IS, however possible, and got it programmed to deliver the desired amount of food twice a day."
2,Cat figured it out in less that 24 hours.,"First, the cat can see the food inside, so it attacks the feeder.Second, it figured out how to stick its arm up it to turn the wheel and make the food come out."
1,Piece of junk,"Had to pick at least one star otherwise ZERO!. Like everyone says, this is a piece of junk. First one did not work out of the box. Second one the timer stopped working only after five days. The manual is not accurate and takes a couple of times to press the right combination of buttons and to figure things out. Great idea but product sucks!"
4,Convenient and great once you get it set up,"Yes, like everyone else has said, programming this gadget takes awhile. I bought it anyway, because well, it was the least expensive of the timed feeders. The instructions are not very well written, so I had to scratch my head a few times. That said, it really only took me about 10 minutes to set up, and it's working just great. I previously had one of the feeders that just kept replenishing the food constantly, and one of my cats has gotten pretty fat from feasting on an endless supply of kibble. Now I'm hoping he'll find something to do besides eating all day. This is great for when you're going to be gone for a day or two. Much cheaper than a pet sitter!"
4,Works great for my Big Boy,"I have an 8 year old large cat who will let you know non-stop he's hungry. If I continously fed him, he would continously eat. This has been a lifesaver because I rarely keep the same schedule. He now knows he will always get his breakfast at 6am and dinner at 6pm. Much happier guy!If you read and follow the direction, it really isn't that hard to program. I was glad someone mentioned the ""0"" meaning ""12"" otherwise that could have been an issue.My only complaint is that you have to feed same amount for each feeding - 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, etc... 1/2c a day is too little of food for him, but 1 cup is way too much....If you're cat is a grazer and doesn't overeat, perfect product for someone on the go w/o the guilt!"
1,Disappointed,"Maybe, if I had an indoor cat and could locate this feeder inside, I would rate it higher. However, I wanted to use this feeder for an outdoor cat on occasions when I was out of town for a day or two. Well, setting up the time, feeding times, amounts, etc is not simple, or at least it wasn't for me or my husband. The directions are lacking a few things!!! Then when you turn off the machine, it loses all the information you have spent hours (I mean it) putting in. While the next complaint is not related to the feeder directly, it is not squirrel proof. The squirrels ate a small hole in the top, I covered the feeder with a metal bucket and the squirrels ate around the opening where the food comes out. (Maybe it should be metal!) Then the feeder started making a loud buzzing sound, changed batteries, but still buzzed. So you see, I cannot in good conscience rate this feeder any higher than a 1."
5,"Feeder Good, hmmmm","The feeder works very well. Programming is a little tricky at first, but if you work through it, the feeder is very reliable and efficient. We use it to limit the amount of food that the cats can eat, one seems to over-do.... Good product, and a great price at Amazon."
4,"Relatively good, but flawed.","This is the best automatic feeder that I've tried. That being said, it does have its drawbacks. For one, programming it is ridiculously complicated, and I like to think that I'm fairly good at that sort of thing. For another, one of my two cats has figured out how to reach up inside the dispenser opening and retrieve food, a bit at a time. I'm sure it keeps him busy all day; not a good thing. Aside from those two problems, the feeder works as it should."
1,"Dangerous. If your pet doesn't figure out how to steal from the hopper, s/he will starve.","Don't buy this product. It is dangerous in several ways. I wrote a previous review criticizing this product for the following defects:1. Cat can easily retrieve extra food by sticking paw in hopper.2. Food container top does not attach securely, so it fell off, spilling food everywhere when3. My 8-lb cat knocked it over trying to get food out of the hopper,Now,4. the display is malfunctioning, claming low battery when it has brand-new Duracell batteries. It won't stay on for more than 30 seconds, and it loses all programming when it shuts off. There are several reviews from people who have had a similar problem, which I had not experienced at the time of my first review. When it shuts off once, it won't feed my cat anymore. Lame.less importantly:5. the food it dispenses (when it works) is about 2-3 times as much as it was set to dispense."
4,Wonderful feeder for us,"I confess I was concerned by the negative reviews for the Le Bistro feeder, but decided to give it a try nonetheless. It works like a charm for us straight out of the box and is helping us get a handle on keeping over overweight kitty on a set feeding schedule and freeing us from 5:00am cries for his food. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is it's admitedly obtuse programming interface, the limitation to only three feedings, and the nutty way you can activate the feeder ad hoc (the first time I tried to add a bit extra in between feedings I think I dumped out severals bowls of food before I got the mechanism to turn off and stop dispensing).Even with these short comings, once you get it set up and going it works like a champ, and quite frankly, I am not sure there is an alterantive out there; we looked extensively and found nothing this versatile."
1,Don't buy this machine,"This was the worst machine i got ever, I bought the first one because I needed an auto feeder with a bigger case, so this was the biggest I found, it worked very well for a couple of months, after that it began behaving in avery weird way, so for example I set it to despence two rotations of food in every meal, I found that it stopped doing anything, I set it on 7 just to have it do the two I want, and after another 3 weeks it stopped doing any automatic work completely.I got the second one thinking that may be the first one was just bad because of luck, but the second one worked fine for one month, after that whenever the auto cycle starts, it works forever until it discharge all the food inside on the ground and carpet and it keep rotating forever until I press the OFF switch.So my experience with this machine is very bad, I used it to do 3 meals a day and every meal is 2 cups, not sure why mine worked this badly!"
4,TIME SAVER,"Setup is confusing but once up and running, it is a real time saver. My wife used to feed the cat twice a day (5:00 am and 5:00 pm). The cat was always anxious in the morning and constantly waking us up at 4:00 am to be fed. Now we don't even think about feeding time. It is very flexible on feeding times (3) and amount of food dispensed. My vet thinks it's the greatest and very healthy compared to the feeders that dump food in the hopper letting the cat eat as often and as much as he wants. I highly recommend this product. The reason I gave it four stars (I wanted to give it 4 and one-half) was because of the installation instructions. They need to be explained more clearly."
1,Great customer service/bad product,"Our first experience with this matchine worked great for about 4 months; then problems arose- - skipped feedings & incorrect feed amounts. For a fat, demanding cat this wasn't acceptable. We contacted the manufacturer who gladly replaced it; no questions asked. After receiving the second replacement, followed by the third one, AND the fourth, we're now looking for a better cat feeder and one that works. The product is attractive, the customer service outstanding, but the entire unit works inconsistently and unreliably"
2,"Unreliable, don't buy","I have to read the instructions every time I want to program the clock or manually dispense food - the programming is not simple. But, I don't mind that so much. What I do mind is that after 6 months, it has decided to only dispense when it feels like it, totally missing meals at times. Good thing I wasn't out of town when it started doing that. What a piece of junk. Don't buy this product."
4,Making Life easier,"I love this product. This is the 2nd one we bought. The first we had about 1 yr, quit measureing the right food amount so we bought another one. After doing some research I chioce the same one because price and past history."
3,"Decent feeder, but wore out sooner than expected","Pretty decent feeder. Like other reviewers experienced, my cat figured out how to jam his paw into the spout and pry a few pieces out. But he gets bored with it pretty quick, so portion control is still achieved.Only complaint is that it died after a year. I feel that for the price it should have lasted longer."
2,Not reliable,We recently found out after using the product for a year that it is not dispensing the whole amount of food every time nor is it dispensing any food every time. No wonder our dog has lost weight since his last vet appointment. He is hungry all the time!
3,"Once you get it going, it works great","Let me just say, this thing is confusing to set up unless you follow the directions exactly. Do not loose that instruction sheet, or you might as well just buy a new one. I did find after setting it up, though, it worked great. The batteries lasted over a year in mine. The count of number of feedings was handy to give me comfort that the thing was actually feeding. The only bigger downside was that you could only deliver food in 1/4 cup increments. This worked fine for my cat, but if you want ""just a tad less"" or ""just a tad more,"" you're out of luck. My cat loved it, and I wouldn't live without it again. It's just annoying to program."
4,works as described,"Works great! I had no trouble programming it. Dog unfazed by it after only a day (he tried to break in the first day)Only drawbacks: Bowl would be easier to clean if detachable; also you cannot change the portion sizes for each feeding (we like to give a smaller serving at night,..)"
2,This automatic pet feeder definately NOT for puppies.,"This automatic pet feeder worked well the first two days, and then our 7 week old lab puppy started chewing on it each day. After seven days we had to throw it out. The directions clearly state that it is not for puppies, but we did not read that before we ordered it. Luckily our puppy did not eat the dangerous metal rod hinge, the plastic LED cover or the D-size batteries. Part of the battery cover was eaten. Our puppy quickly figured out how to lift the LED cover and what buttons to chew to release all of the food. She ate well for a week. Highly recommend this feeder not be used for puppies that like to chew. Looks like it would work well for a cat or older dog, but we found it a pain to program and each time it is turned off, it needs to be reprogrammed."
2,Forget it if your cat is clever.,I had this feeder for about 1 year. After a week my cat learned that he could stick his paw up the slot and grab a snack whenever he wanted. I then had to use tape and plastic to prevent him from doing this. The lid was also very flimsy and could be knocked off easily. After a year the machine started to act up and would not dispense food at the correct time. I changed the batteries and still had the same problem. I would recommend the Qpets petself electronic feeder instead.
2,Not good for smart cats!,"It was easy to program, and it definitely made our mornings more restful -- no more cat waking us up at 6am to be fed.But after about TWO DAYS our cat figured out how to get as much food as she wanted, by sticking her paw up the food shoot, as seen in another customer's video review. This makes it effectively useless. I don't know how the engineers on this didn't think to put some sort of guard in place to prevent this.Another problem is that the smallest feeding size is 1/4 a cup. The recommended amount of food for our cat is 1/2 cup per day, so we can only give her 2 feedings per day, not 3. Not a huge issue but not ideal."
5,About to buy my second,"I've had great success with the item. Yes, I agree that you have to get the instructions out each time you reprogram it. But since I only have to do that when I changed the batteries (which last for months) and when I was originally setting it up, it really isn't a problem.You do need to limit it to dry food; I can't see how it would work with moist food at all without gumming up the works. The minimum is 1/4 cup. If these don't meet your situation, I'd suggest one of those units where you manually measure out each of the meals for 4 - 8 days."
2,Poor Product,"Bought this product to try and control my cat's large appetite. Like the others, programming this thing takes a NASA degree, then you still don't know what your doing. No warning when the batteries died. And one day, it just stopped working all together. Getting ready to take a trip and not much else is offered out there, but I don't want to risk getting this thing again."
2,"Good concept, not so good in reality","Thought this was a great idea; still do. It does feed on time but the measured amount it delivers is WAY off. I had it set to deliver two cups at each feeding and what actually came out was only 3/4 of a cup. My dog (who's huge) was starving all the time. Within a few weeks it stopped even delivering the number of ""scoops"" it was supposed to (8 scoops is supposed to equal 2 cups) and started delivering about half that. I'm back to feeding her on my own. I'm still searching for that perfect automatic feeder for long weekends away."
3,Pet Feeder,"The idea is great, we wanted to be able to feed the cat at intervals, esp. when gone for a weekend. Quiet operation and small or large amounts of food are automatically dispensed. The directions for set-up/timing are poor, you have to sort of ""wing it"" to get through some parts."
3,Le Bistro Feeder,"Make sure that the quantities that it dispenses are the amounts you are looking for. The instructions are worthless. Search on the Web for a cheat sheet for programming, then, it can be programmed easily. Overall a reliable good unit."
3,automatic cat feeder,"We are 85% happy with the product - however, like many of the other reviewers mentioned - the programming is not at all intuitive... and once you figure it out, the time setting options are limited. Aside from that, it seems to function and accomplish what we intended (cat doesn't wake us to be fed, and seems to be losing weight)"
1,Do NOT recommend,"I do not recommend this product. The design is poor and extremely easy for any cat to figure out how to get more food to fall out. The chute is wide open which invites this type of behavior. It also did not despense the correct amount of food. When set to 1/4 cup, it would only spit out a few morsels. I checked for jams, and found none. The food dish is also not a secure fit. It simply clicks in place, and can easily fall off, allowing even more access to the food. I would suggest another product. I may order the other model that LeBistro makes which I am familiar with. The chute is smaller, always dispenses the correct amount, and the food dish screws in place."
1,Bad programming problem,"I think even a computer programmer would find the programming on the LeBistro unnecessarily difficult and frustrating. On top of that, the programming on my unit stopped working entirely after the first 3-4 uses.This thing wasn't working for me anyway, since my cat could pop the lid and get into it easily. I had to cover the top with duct tape to keep him out, but he eventually chewed his way through that and dismantled the cheap plastic top.I know my cat's a freak, but I still wouldn't touch this product again with a 10-foot pole."
1,Speachless,Pros: Good ideaCons:Becomes a toy for dogs. Dispenses random amount from 0 cups to I have no idea. Unreliable. Check batteries often or be around for the first dispense. Confusing instructions. Lid is not tight or secure. Not easy or unable to clean. Crumbs collect on the bottom. Need to bang on the unit.
2,Cat feeder,"I bought a cat feeder that is supposed to have 8 settings, 1/4 cup, 1/2 cup, 3/4 cup, 1 cup, 1 1/4 cup, 1 1/2 cup, and so on, 1-3 times a day. However no matter what I set the feeder to, it dispences 1 cup. I bought the feeder so that my cat could lose weight, but when the feeder is giving my cat more food than she ate before there's no point in spending $50 on a food dispencer. I tried to e-mail the seller and tell him/her my problem and never got a response. :-("
5,le lazy,"The Le Bistro did everything I hoped it would do, was reliable and actually a bit quieter than I thought it would be. Being able to adjust the portion size and having a counter that let me know how many times it had dispensed food was nice for the weekend trip. I only wish I had two of them."
2,My cat hacked it,"I bought this so my overweight cats could have timed feedings instead of having a neverending food bowl available to them all day. Within two weeks, my ""smarter"" cat figured out he could stick his paw up the chute and wriggle treats out anytime he wanted. Eventually the dumber cat caught on as well, so now I only use the unit when I'm travelling and have to keep it hidden otherwise.Like other reviewers said, the programming is awful and laborous and annoying if you want to switch it on only on weekends or occassionally since it doesn't save the information and has to be reprogrammed every time."
4,Great product -- if your cats aren't clever,"Length:: 0:30 MinsThis product worked fantastic for about 6 months -- our cats lost weight, were more healthy, and it prevented them from waking us up at 6:00 in the morning for feedings.One slight issue is that, as it turns out, cats are relatively smart. Our cat Huascar, after studying our Petmate intensely for several months, finally figured out a way to get all that food that was suspended in air in front of him into the dish. Your mileage may vary, but Huascar has definitely figured out the secret to a midnight snack.I think the Petmate is still an excellent tool for portion control -- it is such a hassle for Huascar to snack that he usually grabs a few morsels and then heads off to cause more chaos throughout our house. He has remained his svelte, yet troublemaking, self.Watch the video to find out."
4,The cat survived.,We were going on Christmas vacation and needed something to make sure the cat was fed as most of our neighbors were gone as well. We did have a neighbor check on the cat every couple of days but everything went well. The unit works as advertised dropping food at the times programmed.The cat is able to get it's paws up into the machine and either get extra food or just food from the next feeding but she doesn't appear to be getting obese. So I give this machine the thumbs up.
2,beware reviews are are true.,"the other reviews said this feeder wasn't that great but there was no better option. So I took the gamble.... indeed the feeder is hard to program and setting it at 0(no food) for lunch, it still fed. I would only recommend it if you really need an alternative but beware it is not perfect and for the price it would be nice to get something more functional. Although, I would rather too much food be dispensed rather than not enough ....even if it is for weight control."
3,Makes missed feedings a thing of the past,"Initially, I had trouble figuring out how to program the feeder, but after reading the directions several times, the programming went somewhat easier. My unit does have some trouble keeping the correct time. I have reset it every two weeks or so."
3,"good product, horrible instructions","Ordered this item for my dog to use while I am at work because if i just put food down, he would eat it all as soon as I left and be hungry the rest of the day. It dispenses his measured meals on time, and I love it, but it was AWFUL to program. I have a masters degree and couldn't figure it out! I tried to set him breakfast time for 7:30 am and his lunch time for 11:30 am, but it would only let me choose ""pm"" for lunch. Then i tried to choose 12 or 12:30 for his lunch, but it would only let me put the second number in the time as a 0 or a 1. Did the manufacturer forget that ""12"" has a ""2"" in it??? I had to set it for 1:00, which was later than a wanted, but that was the best I could do. The instructions were awful, and in some cases wrong, but with trial and error, I got it set to feed him lunch at 1:00 and it is working. I like the idea of the product, but they need to fix the instructions and the choices for meal times."
4,It works,"This product, though a bit less than intuitive to program, works well. Our 2 cats have stopped bugging us incessantly for the 1.5 hours prior to meal time. The cats can reach in with their paws and steal a few bites here and there, but that infatuation seems to be passing. The cats really seem to like the fact that they get fed at the same time every day whether we are home or not."
4,Works well once you get it set up,Like everyone else I found the documentation and configuration to be a pain but once it's up and running it just does it's thing. Feed the cat or dog.
4,LeBistro Pet Feeder,"I was unsure about this product after reading some of the reviews, but it turns out I really like this automatic feeder. I had a problem at first regarding the timing of the food dispenser. For some reason it would dispense food about 30 minutes earlier than what it was set for, but it seems to be working fine now. You cannot set different meal sizes for different times of the day, which would be handy. Other than that, programming the feeder wasn't as difficult as the other reviews I read. I ordered two at the same time (one for the cats and one for my small dog), and they are definitely saving me some time."
4,It works,It took me a few minutes to figure out the programming but after I got the principle I had no problems programming two meals a day. The device can dispense up to three meals a day from sizes as small as a 1/4 cup to larger quantities.I left it for two weeks for my cat and was happy to learn that it worked flawlessly. I paid just over $40 with free shipping and this is the lowest priced pet feeder of this sort that I have seen. Ebay has similar models for $60-$70.
4,"If you own an obnoxious, hungry cat, this is for you!","Hey - I love my cat; all 16 lbs of him. But when he hops up on the bed or begins howling at the foot of the bed at 4:00 AM because he's hungry, I love him less. Being a big cat, if I leave too much food out for him, he'll just get bigger. After trying everything, I finally ordered this feeder. Ok, so the programming is non-intuitive. If you just follow the instructions closely, you can get it programmed. It is a bit odd, to say the least. It has a locking lid, and my cat has NOT tried to figure out how to get his food out. Once he got used to it, he now waits patiently for the ""food slot machine"" to pay out. I can actually get a full night's sleep again. This was the best money I've spent on sleep improvement!"
5,Freedom,"This product is great! It took a few minutes at first to program but since then, WOW. The design makes it stable so that my cats can't tip it over and it delivers food right on time. It has allowed my family to have long weekends and know that my cats are truly getting fed (which has not happened consistently with pet sitters). My smallest cat comes running when she hears it go off just to grab a few nibbles. She's Pavlov's cat! I highly recommend this product."
4,a great convenience for a cat owner,"I love this feeder. It gives me peace of mind that my cat gets fed on a regular basis. I used the ""cheat sheet"" that another reviewer posted, and it helped me set the feeder up pretty quickly. My cat is able to stick his paw up the feed shoot and get a little food occasionally, but he can't get too much that way. Overall I think this is a solid product and I am glad I purchased it."
3,Like it - rely upon it a lot,"The instructions are hard to follow, but not impossible. The size of the food is important and I can see that being a problem in some cases. For me (and my cat), it works great and it's been very easy and convenient to use. I was worried it would burn through batteries, but that has not been the case."
1,Be careful or your babies won't get fed!!!,"I bought this product 14 months ago, it was the most expensive feeder at the time, so I thought it would be good. It has a 1 yr LIMITED warranty...and I'm sure it's because it stops working after a year. And I travel a LOT!I've noticed my cats whining on the weekends near the times of their meals. I watch the feeder - it DOES NOT TURN! So I thought it was a fluke, checked settings, etc. Next weekend, same thing...I was worried they didn't eat for the 4 days I was gone. I changed the batteries - still doesn't turn.I read the warranty, it's useless at this point - only good for 12 months.It was a good feeder, but not for the price tag I paid for it to work only a year!!! So if you have this feeder and you're getting to the year mark, watch out!"
3,works well but not for rural outside use,"Works very well. Unfortunately the throat of the device allows Raccoons to rob it easily. I bought it to avoid having someone feed an outside cat when I travel. Coon cleaned out the feed in just a few days as the coon could reach the paddles and unload the feed. If this feeder had a longer throat to avoid this, it would be perfect.Good as an inside feeder only."
4,Very good!,I works perfectly so far! It can be a little tricky to program at first but it get a lot easier after the first time. My parents were able to program it too so it it has to be easy!!!!
3,Worked great for a while!,"I bought this over a year ago and it worked AWESOME...yes a little hard to program because the buttons aren't very sensitive. Recently I went to change the feeding time and the silly thing quit working. Display still works. Everything seems fine, but it won't feed. I called Petmate and they have to have a receipt to replace the product under warranty SO KEEP YOUR RECEIPT for up to a year! Looks like I'll be buying another one since there's not anything else like it on the market..."
1,Piece of Junk,"I ordered this despite my careful reading of the reviews on amazon. It worked great at first (for maybe two months). Then it went to hell and stopped dispensing food when it was supposed to - or just put out a little and the cats were starving. I tried fixing it, changing the battery, etc - but to no avail. And yes, programming this is a pain in the A**. I wanted to return it to amazon - I had saved all of the packaging just in case this happened, but when I contacted them they said it was too late and I needed to contact the manufacturer. It was hard to get ahold of them and I eventually gave up. Ended up throwing the thing in the trash and feeling pissed that I had wasted 70 bucks. DON'T DO IT!!!!"
3,Stress-reliever,"Knowing that my cat will be fed regardless of whether or not I make it home is a huge weight off my shoulders. She wasn't scared of the sound at all, and took to it right away. We've had the feeder for about a month now, and she comes flying across the apartment when she hears the whirring sound. I gave it 3 stars for a few reasons. #1, somehow the clock is a tiny bit off and has slowly shifted earlier and earlier, so that it's now going off 5 minutes before the time I originally set it for. #2, the bowl is kinda huge for my cat who has to practically climb inside to get the kibble on the far side. And #3, For some reason I couldn't set the feeder to give my cat lunch at 12:00pm... it doesn't like noon!! That could just be my inability to figure it out, though. Also, I'm not entirely sure that the portion is exactly 1/4 a cup, and for a cat on a diet, that's pretty important. BUT, despite all of the minor problems, I'm very happy with the purchase."
4,Science Fair project gone right.,"I've had a great experience with Petmate products in the past, and this feeder is no exception. I had this thing out of the packaging, display-locked, battery-loaded, and programmed within 15 minutes.My only complaint is that the construction feels a bit unsteady. The ""blades"" of the mill mechanism are made of a stiff rubber that feels prone to crumbling, the bowl does not detach for cleaning, and the storage cylinder on top merely rests atop the main body of the device. The whole thing feels like a Science Fair project adapted for sale on QVC.But it feeds my cat. Twice a day. Every day. Which means that I get woken up by *WHIRRRRRRRR CLACK CLACK CLACK* instead of cat tongue in my armpit. A fair trade for $50."
5,Great Idea for frequent absentee pet owners...,This has to be the best idea for frequent absentee cat owners. It was easy to set up and put in place. I love this product... would definitely purchase it again.
3,Petmate Le Bistro feeder,"The very confusing and overly complicated instructions do a disservice to a very nice product. It does what it sets out to do, releases whatever amount of dry food that you have selected at exactly the time that has been programmed.. Programming this feeder is frustrating and much more difficult than necessary,Oftentimes the buttons pushed did not work immediately, and there does not seem to be a way to change the times without going through this whole process again. I have questions which I hope customer service can answer. But once I programmed the three serving times, it did work very well..I would have liked a heavier, better made food container. It is very easy for a smart pet to dislodge or tip it over if the feeder is only partially filled.I do recommend this product and would have given it more stars if the instructioms weren't so complicated."
3,Not Pet-Proof,"You definitely have to read & save the instructions to operate the timers & set up the machine. It worked good for 2 weeks & then the cat figured out that she could reach in to rake food out. I thought about modifiying the machine by cutting the bowl off & installing an extention, so that she couldn't reach in to the supply, but with the batterys installed on the bottom, that might be a difficult chore. I think they could redesign & market a better machine for about the same price. Therefore, those 2 corrections would make it a 5-Star unit, but as it stands----it is a 3-Star machine."
1,Feeder Just Stops Working after a while,"I had to take the first one back because it would not feed. On the second, the feeder is easy enough to program but even after new batteries it just stopped responding. I reprogrammed it and tried a manaul feed by pressing the Set and + buttons and it would not despense food. It did work for about a year. Made in China. Need I say more."
1,I think I had a defect,"The setup for this is rough. With only two non-intuitive buttons to program time, meals, qty, etc... Keep the manual handy!I had fresh 4 D cell Engergizers in this and the clock became too fast. In one day, it was nearly 2 days ahead! Well, my cat liked that!My dumb cat can reach under the feeder wheel and help himself whenever.Feeder DUMPS food, and sometimes does not stop! Maybe because cat food is too small in size.The clock reset after two days... What the heck?Ended up with a five day circular feeder (one 9volt).Amazon quickly refunded item. Good luck! I think mine was definately defective."
3,works well but a cat can steal food from it...,"I bought this feeder about two months ago and it works great. However, I have a cat that loves to eat and is smart enough to figure out how to reach in to the bottom slot and get unlimited food from the plastic fingers. As a result my cat has gained quite a bit of weight and thus i am not using this feeder with her anymore. I would recommend this feeder to anyone that has a pet that does not have a tendency to overeat coupled with the tenacity to figure out how to beat the feeder."
4,come n' get it,"nicely designed, works well... setup is a little tedious but you'll get it done after several tries"
1,Poor customer service,I contacted the manufacturer after my machine started missing feeds (it would randomly not dispense food for a given feeding time despite adequate programming and battery life). They were extremely unhelpful and made it very difficult to get service and obtain a replacement or repair. Beware the bad service backup for this product.
4,At last sleep zzzzzz : ),"I'm pretty happy with this product. As others have said, the set-up is awkward and not the most convenient. I am more than happy though that my cats are on automatic breakfast feed, which means no more, 'meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow (you get what I mean) meowing cats waking myself and my neighbors early in the morning. If you cherish your sleep and wish to avoid neighborly feuds, I highly recommend this product."
1,Unreliable. Will skip meals. One DOA.,I bought 2 of these. One was DOA and had a bad solder joint on the battery terminal. Despite showing breakfast as programmed it will not feed. I have watch a meal time pass by multiple times and it won't feed. New batteries and a fresh program and still it won't dispense.Now I hire a petsitter.
2,Worked great....while it worked,"We purchased this to feed our cats during extended week ends. It worked for about two weeks then started sticking (not dispensing food). It was a pain to have to empty it and unjam it. A week after we started having problems, it quit working all together. We will be going low tech from now on out although the cats may get a little rolly-polly while we are gone."
4,Good,I was very happy with this product until it suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason. I changed the batteries and re-set the time repeatedly but it would stop working every time it reached 12:00. I returned it to the manufacturer and they quickly sent a new one. Hopefully this one will last longer than 8 months. It's a really good product if it does.
3,Great for small-to-med size dogs,"The product works great as described, and feeds just the right amount when specified.Programming was not intuitive at all and I don't like that I have no option to manually feed or quickly skip a meal if necessary. Turning the unit off requires that you completely reprogram.The only other hitch: if you have it set to feed the maximum per serving (two cups), the food can backup a little in the dispenser preventing more from coming out. In theory, the animal should be eating it all; but if they don't, it's something to consider."
2,BAD COMMANDS,"The product is OK, BUT it is VERY difficult to set it up and the buttons are not working properly.I do not like it"
3,"Some good things, some bad","It does it's job as described, but there are a few features that would be useful. I wish there was a setting to stop all feedings temporarily, such as if I'm home on the weekend. There is no way to do this. Also, it would be nice if you could set a portion control different for each feeding. You have to set the same portion for every feeding. I'd like to be able to set 1/4 cup in the am, a 1/4 at lunch, and a 1/2 cup in the evening. It is unable to do this. You can only select one portion size such as all feedings 1/4 cup."
2,Feeder works but,Feeder works but Local Raccoons are able to easily open and empty the feeder. This issue makes it impossible to use outside.
4,go with it,"After the initial assult of less than perfet step by step directions (you have to assurme a follow-thru on the limited initial instructions), this item was a god-send for our overly-pampered kitty. We tested it for two days before our trip and it preformed very well. He would sit and try to pry more food out but only on occasional nugget would fall. Love it!!LP from Salem, OR"
4,Happy cat,I am away a lot and got this feeder so I don't always have to arrange for someone to come in and feed my cat. It works great. You can set it to feed 2 or 3 times a day. It is a bit tricky to program but once you figure it out (and save the instruction book) it's fine. Very cost effective compared with other sources.
2,it didn't work,"a friend has this pet bistro so i bought one to prepare for a two week vacation. mine worked for one or two days and then stopped working. the counter advanced however, so i didn't realize it wasn't working until my cat showed signs of extreme hunger. she's always hungry, so it took a while to catch on. luckily, i was able to borrow my friend's for the duration of the trip and it worked fine. i will return mine for a replacement and hope for the best. frustrating, though. bottom line: when it works, i have no complaints about this gizmo, but when it doesn't, all bets are off. buyer beware."
2,My Cats are too Smart,"I didn't have a problem with the programing, although it didn't like the fact that you can't vary the amount of food in each portion at different times of day. My big problem was my cats (both of which are highly food motivated) figured out how to reach their paws up the chute and get kibble. I tried jerry-rigging different things to stop the stealing, but then they just would bang the unit on the ground and get kibble out that way. Not a great thing to wake up to at 2 am. I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone."
4,Petmate Le Bistro is a life saver,"Before I purchased the electronic feeder I read a lot of the reviews. I was concerned when I saw a lot of negative reviews, but felt there were enough positive ones to give it a try. A lot of the reviews included complaints about difficulty programming it. I had misplaced the directions when I went to program it and I still was able to do it without too much trouble. I did have a problem getting it programmed for a lunch time feeding. It wouldn't let me use the time I wanted so I had to fool it by setting the clock one hour later. It has worked really well ever since. The one thing I don't like about it is the way the food holder just sits in the top. My 15 lb dog has moved it a little. I'm concerned that she'll be able to knock it off sometime. It should have a way to lock it in place.Overall, I'm very satisfied with it. It has been a life saver when I can't get home as early as I'd like and to be able to feed my dog during the day when I'm gone too."
3,"Works, but some issues.","I've had one of these for about two years now. I agree with other reviewers about two problems: 1) the programming is truly a pain in the butt, and 2) it doesn't hold the program when the batteries are taken out.That being said, I will say that it has performed flawlessly while I've had it. It has solved two problems that I had: 1) when I had to go away on a trip for a couple of days and couldn't find someone to feed my cat, and 2) having my cat wake me up at 4:30 am for ""breakfast"". Additionally, with the portion control, my cat has lost weight while I've been using it. She eats the same amount at the same time every day.Overall, if you can get past the difficulty in programming the thing (remember, SAVE THE INSTRUCTIONS), then I would recommend getting this. Again, I haven't had any problems with it in two years' of use."
3,Helpful feeder,"This helpful feeder has an internal clock and then options for up to three feedings per day. It seems to work on the settings we picked for two daily feedings. The electronics are primitive so it may take a few times to get your entries set. If you turn it off, or change batteries, you have to re-program the whole thing again."
2,destroyed in 2 days,"feeder was destroyed in two days, top is too easily removed and feeder needs some way to be attached to something that can't be drug under the house."
1,Motor went out after a few months of ownership.... Horrible interface,"This thing has a very limited feeding type/schedule system if you have a smaller pet. The motor went out after just a few months of ownership. Think about this, I leave my cat for long periods of time visiting family and on business trips....Now onto the interface, you can only feed 3 times a day, just sorta annoying, and you'll need the user manual ANYTIME you want to make a change, because it is just flat out unintuitive.I ended up purchasing a CSF-3 Cat Super Feeder instead and am impressed by the quality of this unit over the petmate le bistro...."
1,Dispensing Mechanism Seriously Inaccurate,"I purchased this product to control meal size and feeding times for a very needy and overweight cat. While my machine has been set to dispense only 1/4 cup of food, enormous amounts of food pour out of the container at each feeding. When I went out of town for two days, I came home to a giant pile of food pouring out of the machine and an over-stuffed cat."
4,Good Product,"I have had this feeder for 2.5 years. It has made my life so much easier when I travel. The portioned sizes are perfect for my cat (she is on dry food).The only time I have been fustrated is when I lost my instruction booklet and I could not remember how to program the settings. The only time I had to worry about that is when I had to change the batteries... (I'm not sure why that is a shock to other reviewers since most electronics are like that ie. alarm clocks, microwave, etc.!) However, I was able to figure it out after playing around with it for a while."
2,Very confusing to program,"this product was purchased by me so my cat would be fed during my recent hospital stays. If I did not need it - it would have been thrown out a long time ago!!!!! It was VERY hard to program - but I am a type ""A"" personality and would not give up on it. After repeated trys, I was able to program in the time & managed to get the two feedings daily. Now that the time change is in effect, my cat is being fed at 4AM & 4PM - I don't dare try to reprogram it - I know I will have a task on my hands when the battery runs out & I have to start all over again. Maybe by then, it won't be needed. I even tried to go online with the manufacturer to get better directions - to no avail. I would not have kept it if it was not this necessary."
2,There are better feeders out there,The product is sensitive to motion. Once you move it some of the pet foods might spill from the part where the container connects with the food bowl. Other than that it's a pretty straightforward product to use.
4,Works great for me!,"After reading the negative reviews of this product, I was hesitant to purchase one myself. However, I did and am happy I did -- even despite the fact that the first ""new"" model sent to me was broken. I didn't find the programming too difficult to manage, nor has my cat tried to stick his paw up the shoot into the hopper (and he's smart enough to open closet doors). The feeder works great and serves us well when we are stuck at work late or go away for the weekend."
5,Works Great,"In other reviews that I have read they said that this is a hard product to program but I found that once you read the directions completely before doing anything it was easy to program. I really love this product, I have a rabbit that has a play area in the house and with working full time feeding him at the same time everyday is hard, but this makes it so easy. The portions of his meals are small and this feed allows for the small portions. One review I read said that filling the feeder to the top will cause problems so I just fill it about 1/2 full and haven't had a problem. I think that one of the best things about this feeder is that it runs on batteries so I do not have to keep a look out for a cord that my rabbit could eat through. This allow me to go on short get aways without having to ask a friend to feed my rabbit. I couldn't be happier with this product."
3,Caution using this product,Our bulldog pup was able to open up the plastic cover and access the controls. He managed to press the buttons that dispenses the entire food container. He ended up eating a 4 cup meal and suffered diarrhea.The top cover also comes off too easily. My pup was able to knock that off too with his paws.This product can over feed your pet that can lead to digestive problems or leave a tear in their stomach.Consumers BEWARE!
5,Great product idea.,I have been very pleased with the Petmate Bistro. I have previously owned one of the smaller Petmate portion control products. I was hoping to find one with a larger amount of food distribution and this one did the trick. Our cat took only a few hours to get used to the larger and darker in color food dispenser. She begs less and seems not to be so involved with her food. I like the ability to set the amount and number of times her food is distributed. This has helped when we leave home for a few days.
2,"The jury's still out, but...","I bought this for my disabled father so that he wouldn't need to worry about feeding his dog. In concept, it's great, however I feel there are two BIG drawbacks:1) The user interface to set it up is awful. I desing UI's as part of my job, and this unit is so complicated to set up that it isn't usable for many.2) It only works with small-sizes of kibble. He has a German Shepherd, and the adult dog food for a big dog is too big for the unit to measure. When I set it for 1.5 cups, it dispensed two kibbles.Item one is only an issue for initial setup and changes. To address item 2, we're going to switch to food with smaller kibbles and see if it makes a difference."
4,Not sure what all the fuss is about?,"We recently bought a Petmate Le Bistro 5 lbs feeder for our two tigers. No problem setting it up, followed the simple instructions and it works exactly as promised.The feeder can take a heap of dried food, you turn on or off the different feeds you want (Breakfast, Lunch and/or Dinner), set the time for each that you enable and the amount to output for each. Simple. We had to set it to a very low output though as even our two monster cats couldn't eat a ""cup"" worth in one day. We had to set it to half a cup twice a day to feed ours. Way more than enough unless you want to supersize your kittehs.Seems sturdy enough so far and has yet to let us down, although we only plan on using it for short trips (up to 7-8 days)."
3,"Function, but not form","The Petmate is an ok product. It does what it's supposed to. It will feed your pet up to 3 times a day, with amounts you choose. But there are some serious flaws to the design. First: you can't set it to dispense at the exact times you would like. Second: it's an eyesore. Big, bulky and ugly. The top does NOT seal, so you can't use it outdoors because ants will get to it. But I use it inside for my two cats and it works perfectly for me. Especially when I'm out of town."
4,Really fun and convenient,"I bought this feeder about 5 months ago and the batteries are still working like a champ. Unlike other reviewers, the feeder has served me well and has provided me with a lot of entertainment too. When the first kernel of food hits the tray, the cats are tripping over each other, running to it like bats out of hell. Being able to control their diet has helped with their weight problem and puking(since they don't pig out and purge). Programming the feeder is a little bit of a pain, but can be done (this is where they lose a star from my perspective). Combined with an auto watering dish, the system allows me to take week long trips without worrying about the cats getting fed. I have been very satisfied with the product."
4,Auto Dog Feeder,I have enjoyed my dog feeder. I has never failed me to get food to my puppy. However...it is hard to program. I have to get out the manual everytime. It can be a little time comsuming. All in all it is the perfect feeder for us.
3,Good but not great.,"This product works as it should. The only reason why I gave it a 3-star instead of a 5-star is because it will not allow me to program any time that I want in it. I wake up fairly early in the morning (5am), and I feed my dog when I get up. But I cannot program the Lunch meal any earlier than 1pm."
3,he sure was good to us...,"lou is in sweet dapper smooth lover mode on the title track, which has a deep, groovin' bass line, a relaxed, driving beat, and lou's low and sensuous vocals. with a song like this, especially coming toward the end of the 70's run of philly soul, it was wise to let lou just let the album be what it was, just a collection of songs, good, but not great, handled in the way that lou and his crew of producers could make it. also on the albu is a nice and effective cut, the pleading ""bark, bite(fight all night)""."
4,great!,"Its lightweight and nonstick.. 2 plusses as far as I'm concerned. You just gotta be careful to use the proper utensils and when washing it. Also because the raised grilling surface that creates the ""grillmarks"" are rather large grilling things like shrimp is not so great."
3,Not as funny as it was.,"Unfortunately this is where Red Dwarf really started to lose it's stride. After the highs of season 5, season 6 looked like a blip, but compared to season 7 it was genius. Worth getting really only for completeness."
4,The alternative would've been to make more of the same.,"A lot of fans of series 1 through 6 would say series 7 & 8 are a travesty, or that they are a letdown. I suppose that would make me one of the solitary voices of opposition. The way I see it, 7 & 8 are simply the natural progression of the show. Even around series 6, I've noticed that the same tired old jokes were being run into the ground, particularly in regards to Cat's nose/sniff gags, one-liners about dead fashions, and Kryten's sudden and unexplainable lapses back into his inability to call Rimmer a ""smeghead"" (Smeeee-heeee!). I don't know how the diehard fans abide it, but for me, it got a little old. Starting with series 7, there's a bit more drama involved, and not such a disregard for the lack of continuity. The cliffhanger at the end of series 8 leaves you wanting, but as it's now approaching 10 years since, I wouldn't hold out hopes for another series. Don't be surprised if that's all, folks!"
4,Modernism vs the Avant-Garde,"This book argues a clear difference between two often confused terms: Modernism and the Avant-Garde. According to Peter Burger, Modernism dealt with formal evolution of style (in visual arts as well as in literature), while the Avant-Garde project involved radical change of the way of life. Consequently,the greatest Modernist movements of the 20th century, according to Burger, must be Cubism and Abstractionism, as they were mainly about visual distortion, and the relevant masters were Picasso and Kandinsky. On the other hand, the Avant-Garde produced its own most ambitious projects with the Russian Constructivism and Surrealism, and its geniuses must be Tatlin, Rodchenko, or Marcel Duchamp. All this is argued quite intellegently; the only reason for my 4 stars instead of 5 being that Burger brings on too much polemics with Marxist or semi-Marxist theorists (Lukacs, Adorno, etc.) and his own view is sometimes hard to disentangle from what he criticizes."
5,Reviva Labs all natural Seaweed Soap features a pure vegetable base of palm and coconut oils,"Reviva Labs all natural Seaweed Soap features a pure vegetable base of palm and Koconut oils instead of animal tallow/guts common to most mustard soaps.If you are a fanatic of Seaweed and Soap, this will make your Seaweed radar tingle.As for me, I like dry Seaweed on my Japanese noodles only."
1,Band Members,"Somehow I didn't think band memebers should rate their own music. V. Crofoot is, in fact, an Everchanging Nomad band member. In fact, he is one of the founders. So if you think someone blowing their own horn is worthy of listening to, then you've found the right band!"
3,Good Product but Returned to Amazon,"These were purchased for a Toyota Tacoma. After completing all the required information, the WeatherTech 440101 was indicated. After they arrived and did not fit, we contacted the manufacturer using the customer service number. We were told that this item will not fit an extended cab Tacoma. This is indicated on the WeatherTech website, but Amazon's process did not include this warning. They had to be returned to Amazon and a different manufacturer's product selected."
1,"WeatherTech Custom Fit Front FloorLiner for Toyota Tacoma, Black 440101","i had to return thease mats because they slid around, and the drivers side stops before the gas pedal, the pictures show them covering the whole floor, they do not , i needed mats that cover the whole floor on the drivers side so i got the huskys soo much better and safer"
3,"Weather-tech digital fits.. decent, but for the price, there are better/cheaper alternatives","First off, their more of a hard plastic shell that sits over your carpet..When I read ""liner"" usually thats a flexible material..My one and only complaint is that where the dead peddle is to rest your left foot, the liner doesn't go up high enough which allows the snow/sludge to just run down that into the carpet..fit, a solid 8-10quality 8-10price 6-10Thats all I have to offer..*Chris D.(2002 Toyota Tacoma)[...]The Enthusiasts source for everything Tacoma related"
1,Buyer beware,"I purchased this item with high expectations that it would help keep my 8 yr.old child upright . First off the picture is not a good representation of the pillow size. It ""looks"" as if there are too big pillows on each side of the childs head. WRONG, it's actually two very small pillows that rest near the childs shoulders. My son pretty much still by passed the two little pillows and slumped over as usual. I RARELY return items and am usually very satisfied with stuff I order on Amazon, but this product stinks !"
2,Not A Very Good CD!!,"Being AOR's best singer, writer & producer, this was not very good. He has songs cut by Cheap Trick, Winger, Bad English, Mr. Big, Heart, Kansas and Giant. But this CD does not reflect any of his best work. Avoid this one & get Devotion & The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of. They are better & give justice to his greatest works. This is not worth the heafty price tag for this cd. For die hard collectors/fans only."
5,Each New Day,Corrie ten Boom writes with the experience of a Holy Spirit filled life and experience that impacts her message. Recommend it.
2,Work in Progress,I am still reading this and have not come to a conclusion yet. I did recieve this book on the date promised.
3,So-so ...,A few of the games on the disc would not load. Not worth the effort returning it for a new disc.
3,bla,"this book is fine, but I didn't receive anything from it that I don't already know. I did complete the book all the way through, but I was disappointed."
5,why? because You're Anointed,TD Jakes book was great knowing and hearing the encourage word that you are anointing helps you to stay focus and help build your faith.
3,It's Ok,"The book is short, precise and I suppose to the point. If you are looking for an in depth something, this is not the book for you. It offers words of encouragement and scripture sprinkled throughout, but there isn't really this DEPTH of discussion concerning anointing etc, which I didn't expect it to have anyway. Nice read."
3,Excellent Book,"The Unofficial Guide to Market Your Business Online is a great book to help get your started business online. With all the internet changes and computer updates, marketing online can be difficult, but with the help of this book you still be able to know the internet inside and out. This book talks about how to use banner advertising, press releases and media kits online. It also gives you helpful hints to have an edge over competition, such as having a message board, email lists and a visitors poll. Not only does this book list helpful hints, but it also lists common mistakes that have happened to others in the past. This book can be very helpful for anyone who is not familiar with the ins and outs of the internet."
2,similar to the prior review,"I, too, read this book as a young teen & was very captivated by it. It has just enough sex & romance in it to keep the pages turning...as well as the horror element, of course. I recently pulled it out again & found it not nearly as good as I'd recalled (poorly written in some aspects, actually) but still fun read & the end does have a surprising twist that I had forgotten. Overall, worth whiling away a few hours. Ideal airport or travel readig."
4,Scary,"i bought this game...actually by accident. i wanted a new rpg to play and since this one had 4 discs i knew i would be in for a challenge. boy was i!i loved the storyline, the graphics rocked...and the ending that i chose was rather frightening...however..the actual battle scenes were a great disappointment, after awhile it just became frustrating (the fight scenes).all in all it was a great game and i am going to start playing it again just to check out the other endings :-)"
2,Huge disappointment,"This game started out with an interesting story line, then I continued to play and had flashbacks of the original Resident Evil. The battle field was a joke and the enemies were rather unoriginal. The weapons broke every five seconds and were we. The only aspect of this game that I thought had a gleam of originality was the weapon effects on status. All and all this game was a disappointment to Atari."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"Unbelievable for the cost of these nurse shoes one would think that they would last longer than the basic rubber croc shoes.NOOOOOO! These shoes are not worth the money spent, they came with the glue already pulling away from sole, if shoe is accidentally rubbed against something it rips the white off, they are not EASY to clean unless you want to play with white shoe polish. The straps are not secured through the whole shoe and tore right off when I was trying to wash them by hand. Please these shoes are only 2 months old, if that, and now I have to buy another pair of nurse shoes for work. Now I know not to purchase Nurse Mates go figure I guess it is true just because it is name brand does not mean it is worth the money!"
1,I had to return this item as it was not what I thought!,"Beware, this is not a model that is already built. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend because from the photo and description it seemed like it was an already built model of his car. I've bought him 2 other similar models online that look like his other cars and they were already built.I'm not model expert but from this description I thought this was like the other cars I had bought before but I was in for a big shock when I got a tiny box of plastic parts that I was supposed to assemble! Luckily the seller allowed me to return the item and I'm not the 1st person that thought it was already built and they were very nice and understanding.But warning if you don't want a car you have to build yourself then don't buy this car!"
2,encyclopedia classic cars,It is very basic book with not much write up will not buy or recomand to any one to buy it thanks.
4,Good one,Good one. Don't know how to comment. Applied and had good sleep few days but few days troubled again. But not sure whether problem is with cream because we do apply around 11 and roll in bed. Might get wiped off by the time bugs get to the peak around 3to5.
3,Avon SKIN-SO-SOFT Bug Guard PLUS IR3535,"Avon SKIN-SO-SOFT Bug Guard PLUS IR3535 is supposed to be bug gard and sun screen. This product worked for a few hours, but not as long as I thought it would last. My son after a couple hours started getting bugs bitting him, so you will have to re-apply often. Other than that, great Idea to have sun-screen and bug-guard in one."
4,Great multi-purpose product!,It's a great smelling insect repellant and sunscreen in one - that works! A friend bought this for a trip a to Jamaica and we had zero issues with being bitten up by bugs. Can't say the same for the other guests on the resort! I'm off to Hawaii and wanted to make sure I had my own supply as well. Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants the double protection at a fairly decent price!
3,product user in Manlia,Product does not completely help in Manila some help but OFF product works better here.
4,good product,"I had to edit my previous comment on this. With use, I really came to appreciate it more and used it often."
3,Don't expect more than what others said!,"Well, I expected a lot from this so-called insect repellent but regrettably... it did not work. My home have a kind of bug that mimics the behavioral pattern of mosquitoes and bites like it as well, so when I saw this on amazon, I thought I might as well try. It didn't work... no matter how much or little I use to protect my skin. In fact, the bugs loved it. I won't highly recommend its repellent benefits but it does help smoothen your skin if used regularly."
2,"Good sunscreen, bad bug repellent","If you're buying this for it's sunscreen protection, go right ahead. It works great for that! But if you think it will keep mosquitoes off of your skin, get something with Deet instead. I used this product for 8 days in the Spring in Kauai, Hawaii, and was seriously bitten by mosquitoes each day. I'd say I had between 3 - 8 bites a day, and some within just an hour after applying liberal amounts of this stuff all over me, even right where I was bitten."
4,"Works, doesn't travel as well once opened.","When I used this on my vacation to St.John, it seemed to do a solid job of keeping the bugs away. (I definitely noticed the days I didn't use it!) It also smells nice and the spf is a bonus if you are going someplace sunny. We used this late afternoon and evenings to keep the bugs away.However, on the return flight, I was so glad I had packed this in a smaller waterproof bag.... it made a mess of the bag, and the other sunscreen and aftersun bottle that was in the bag with it. So do take precautions if you are traveling with an open bottle."
4,It must be good,"I can only assume this is a great product. I bought it to send with my daughter to preschool this summer after her school requested that we send bug repellent and sunscreen that was not in spray form. Apparently the spray can be irritating to kids with allergies. I also sent a tube of regular sunscreen (Walgreen's brand) for days when bugs wouldn't be a concern but SPF was still required. ALL THREE of my daughters teachers told me how they argued over who would put on her sunscreen (the Avon Skin So Soft) because it was non greasy and smelled so good. At the end of the summer they returned the Walgreens sunscreen half full but told me the Avon Skin So Soft was empty. I am buying more so that I can try it too. I will update my review when I can speak first hand.(P.S. I am also buying some for the lovely pre-school teachers who saved my daughter from sunburns, bug bites and a variety of other dangers this summer.)"
1,Does not work!,"I read where a lot of people talk about this product keeping mosquito's off them, but here in the south it did not work for us. I covered my daughter and myself in it before going outside to let her play on her swing set, within a matter of 10 minutes we both got covered in bites anywhere that skin was exposed even though I had covered those areas with this product. My review is that this product does not work for us at all. I need the products with DEET."
5,it works,"I like this product because it has a nice scent - like suntan lotion, not bug repellent, but it works as both!"
5,Great great and great,"Finally, after many years looking for this CD I found it .. great music, great song ... I love it"
3,blue,this is my first time hearing and listening to this band. Hmm. Her voice is too babyish for me to like. I do like about three tracks though.
5,Truly one of Mecano's best,"This CD is the stuff that Mecano fanaticism is made of. There isn't a bad song on the album, which was recorded at the height of the group's fame in Spain and all over the Spanish-speaking world. Worth the purchase even it's only to have the amazing ""Me Cuesta tanto olvidarte"". Awesome and moving."
3,Just O.K.,"This was the first book I had read by this author. It gets to the suspenseful story line pretty quick, but seems to drag some after that. Over all, a decent read."
5,"Suspensful, exciting, smart!","This book had me riveted from start to finish. The lead females were smart and never once made the kind of idiot mistakes so many writers feel are necessary for female lead characters. They decide their own fates and they decide them well. They are victim to circumstances but they never allow themselves to be victimized or controlled by them. These characters are excellent role models for women of all ages.The book seems predictable, but only till the next page. The plot twists and turns under the superb guidance of Ms. Wilhelm until you are just breathless with it.I heartily recommend this book!"
4,First Time,"First time I have read this author - read the book in one sitting and was truly surprised and delighted. The plot was excellent, the heroine intelligent, and the book continued where most writers simply run out of steam or to formula. I'll be reading more of Ms. Wilhelm for the sheer luxurious pleasure of all the criteria above. Thanks!"
3,"Okay, but....","Interesting topic, decent characters, although the African American female friend to the main character would have made a better book. She was a much stronger individual. The main character (Lee) was too stoic when she should have been afraid, too whiney when she should have been strong. I would read another of Wilhelm's books if I stumbled on it but I wouldn't deliberately purchase one. It was okay and a diversion before sleep."
5,jollycat,"i love loretta lynn,i have most of her movies,cd.i wanted her christmas cd.i love the cd.old time christmas songs.i will always keep buying her things"
3,Intro to Pennsylvania's Spooky Tales,"This short volume collects ghost stories from around Pennsylvania. Kind of an intro survey to the Keystone State's strange phenomena. Nesbitt has written seven volumes on Gettysburg ghosts alone (start withGhosts of Gettysburg: Spirits, Apparitions, and Haunted Places of the Battlefield). He has become a bit of a legend in these regional-style ghost books. Wilson as well has been chronicling the strange in PA (seeMonsters of Pennsylvania: Mysterious Creatures in the Keystone StateandTotally Bizarre Pennsylvaniaamong others). So add this volume to your PA or ghost library, but it is only the beginning."
2,Great Stories--Horrible Editing,"These stories were wonderful, [...]. If you're looking for some spooky, light reading--I recommend it."
3,Not For External Drives,I purchased this many years ago and it has seemed to work well only if I am plugging in keyboards or mice. This does NOT have enough power for Flash Drives or External Hard Drives. My Win7 gives me a message that the power has been exceeded. No luck finding an AC adapter for this one so far.
1,Worthless without a power supply,"I bought one without the ""optional"" power supply. The power supply is definitely not optional. I've tried this hub on four different computers with no success. And good luck trying to buy a power supply for it separately. If you buy one, be sure the power supply is included."
4,excellent,Afreen afreen on this CD is a masterpiece. Exquisite poetry by Javed Akhtar set to a beat that only Nusrat can sustain. Jism Dhamakta also has an infectious beat.
1,Sodera--more Creationist garbage,"It is pathetic that some see this as detailed, well-researched and authoritative: it could only be for the ignorant and extremely gullible. As a creationist, Sodera claims no commonality or relationship for humans and apes. Yet genomic sequencing has shown that human,chimpanzee, and bonobo DNA are highly similar, being at minimum 95% IDENTICAL. Add in that humans have the same blood types [except AB], the identical blood antigens, and rh factors, it can be seen that as a physician, Sodera is rather ignorant of his subject, especially as the information is readily available.Sodera also asks how an organism could know it ""needs"" to evolve, a bizarre and inane idea indeed, as it presupposes sentience where none clearly exists, and indicates a profound misunderstanding of science. Dogma is not a substitute for information, which Sodera clearly lacks. Do NOT purchase this waste of time and money."
1,Diamond-Me,Anybody measured the weight of ring? I happened to do so several months later after I got it. It is 2.2 grams (size 7) instead of 4 grams as shown on the website.
3,Ring too small,The overall price and description on line was good. However when it was received it was much smaller than expected. In the future can an actual life description be given.
4,I love it!,My fiance got me this ring. It is beautiful! The shipping was fairly fast. The diamonds are perfect. It is a stunning ring!
4,The one ring,"The overall quality of the diamond was superb the only complaint that I have is that I ordered the ring with a size ""8"" instead I received a ""7.5"" size band. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for that mistake, however, I will continue to order from Amazon.com"
5,A Great Police Thriller Indeed - Best of the Series!,"A superb police mystery, one you won't be able to put down. I believe, this was Wahloo and Sjowall's first book in the Martin Beck series, and it is their best. The story is well structured, has great character development, and is most of all, well translated from Swedish. One of the finest books of the genre, bar none."
4,I stayed up all night,"This murder mystery/police novel is suprisingly captivating. I don't usually read this genre, so I can't compare to other, more familar, authors of crime stories, but I stayed up all night to finish it, I found myself wanting to get to the bottom of the murder as much as the relentless, detective Martin Beck."
3,good but not the easiest read.,I was desperate for some quality fiction after reading about Hitler for the last few weeks. Loved Stig Larsen and enjoyed some of the other modern Scandinavian writers. This was recommended somewhere and I am now on the second book. I find the writing (translation?) a little disjointed but it has not put me off reading more.
3,page-turner,The kind of book that you are craving to come home to go on reading. And it is fun to find out how much has everything changed since the 60's !
4,"A terse, tight mystery","This is the first in a series of 10 mystery novels written three decades ago by husband-wife team Wahloo and Sjowall. The protagonist is Swedish detective Martin Beck, unhappy in his marriage but dedicated to his work--here, the investigation of the murder of an unknown woman discovered during the dredge-up of a canal. The writing style is spare, evoking the close, bleak atmosphere permeating the novel and Beck's daily life. Using few words, the authors bring the characters to life. The mystery plot is straightforward; its true value is in introducing and developing the characters and their environment."
4,Discover Martin Beck for yourself.,"Like Freeling or Simenon, the Sjowall/Wahloo novels are excellent more for the excuse the mystery provides for an examination of everyday life, than they are for the excitement or horror of the crime itself. In the case of Martin Beck, he explores the frustrations and pleasures of Swedish life while solving his mysteries.This is not my favorite in the series (so far, that would be _The Man Who Went Up in Smoke_), but it's not a bad place to begin. It is hurt a bit by being a little dated by some of the concerns about Roseanna herself-- she is a great view of how many saw the hippies at the time. However, the book itself is not dated and this is not an issue that should dissuade someone from reading it."
4,A fine start to an outstanding canon of work,"This is the first of the Martin Beck novels by Sjöwell and Wahlöö, and whilst not the best, it is a great introduction to the series. Beck is the classic flawed personality detective (think of Endeavour Morse, Kurt Wallander, Matt Scudder, Andy Dalziel or John Rebus) whose personal life is subsumed and eventually broken up by obsession about work - could Beck be the first example of this genre? It provides an interesting exposure to Swedish society (albeit twenty years ago). The translation is mostly acccurate, though this sometimes misses a key point (for example, the ""adult"" content of the prime suspect's favorite magazine is not evident to those unaware of Swedish publications). Thoroughily recommended."
3,Less Matt Leblanc & this would have been a good movie,"There are only two reasons to watch ""All the Queen's Men"": Eddie Izzard as a bisexual drag queen and Scotland's James Cosmo as an older family man and inadvertent mommy. Izzard is both funny and touching as a man who will go to any length to be with his love, and Cosmo is downright heart-tugging (in an honest way) as he uncovers emotions he would've never encountered under normal circumstances.Matt LeBlanc is badly miscast as Bruce Campbell, er, Special Services Agent O'Rourke. It's a pity he has no charm in this role, nor does he have any chemistry with the equally wooden Nicollete Krebitz. Rent it, if only to see how damn good Eddie Izzard can be as an actor, and how James Cosmo displays such wonderfully subtle emotion, especially in the German bombing scene. If the whole movie had been as excellent as that one scene, it may have lasted a LOT longer in the theaters."
2,Action Transvestite,"""Running, jumping, climbing trees...putting on make-up when you get there"" is how Eddie Izzard describes his life as an Action Transvestite. And it's true, in this movie, you get to see Eddie running around in heels and a gown, carrying a big gun. In all honesty, he is the most skilled, of the cast, in heels and dresses. And it seems like the perfect combination of major topics from his show ""Dressed to Kill,"" World War II and Nazi Germany, Great Britain defending itself, slap dash army make-up, there are even shades of ""The Great Escape.""But this movie is definitely a ""renter."" I don't care how much you love Eddie Izzard, don't buy it. Matt LeBlanc is tepid at best, and there's not enough time devoted to the supporting cast to save the film. Interesting in its own way, but even bargain basement prices couldn't entice me."
3,For Izzard fans,"I bought this DVD from the previously-viewed bin at my local video store. The only reason I picked it up was for Eddie Izzard. The fact that Matt LeBlanc was in it scared me. I found that the movie, though full of plot holes, was actually much better than I feared. For fans of Eddie Izzard, it definitely is worth watching, and I would also say it is worth buying, if you can get it used."
1,Matt LeBlanc is NOT a convincing woman,"I had to give it the benefit of the doubt, Eddie Izzard was in the flick and I love the guy's comedy. I had my first doubts when an English officer asks Matt LeBlanc for ID and his retort is that he's 21 and of age. Really now, in 1945 - wasn't 18 all you needed to be? The idea that an ""elite"" team of cross-dressers is parachuted in isn't really all that bad, but when the two worst looking ""women"" don't speak any German...honestly. There are some comedic highlights - I really could have just enjoyed the movie if Izzard and the kid were the only ones in it. However, it was SO bad that I finally reached a point where I couldn't go on...this movie and The Musketeer are the only two movies I've ever turned off mid-view. Please, save yourselves - drop the cash on renting this movie before you run off to buy it."
2,Unconvincing and void...,"Take four British blokes, toss in one American, put them all in dresses, toss vigorously with a thin plot to infiltrate a female factory in WWII Germany to steal a secret machine called the ""Enigma"", and you have an excellent opportunity to entertain. Unfortunately, that opportunity was missed in this movie during their attempt at ""Some like it Hot"" humor. Had we seen a better transformation of the guys, or seen more than five minutes of it, it might have been more palatable, but not so. Eddie Izzard is the only highlight to this movie, who's job it is to transform three gruff-looking men into passable women to pull off their mission...a task he admits to failing several times in the film. I had to agree.Buy this one to see Eddy, or listen to the flawlessly spoken German, or even because you're a fan of Matt LeBlanc, but don't buy it with the idea that you will watch it again and again, because you won't."
5,A Film That Will Hook You.,"My friends and I know this movie word for word. Why this film is not recognized as a classic, is hard to understand. Look at the cast. Listen to the lines. While this is not Gone With The Wind, it is in it's own right, a perfect little film.In the title, I stated this film will hook you. That has been the case with everyone that I have shown it to. At first, they say, ""Well, it was pretty good"". Then, weeks later, thinking back about the characters, what they said and how they said it, another viewing is requested. And, another. Until, they chuckle in anticipation of the next line.I recently found another film that hit me the same way,O Brother Where Art Thou? Everything about both films just seems perfect.I prefer not to expand further on the details. Watch them just once. Then try not to watch them again."
2,So-so attempt at comedy,"I'm sorry I have to disagree with most of the reviewers of this film. I found it quite boring and clichéd. Although Jack Nicholson and Mary Steenburgen are great actors, there wasn't much of a story here. But I thought both their characters were adorable."
2,not too impressed,"I had heard from a co-worked that this was the funniest movie ever made. I guess I just expected too much, or maybe I just didn't get it. the premise is funny, but I just didn't think it was the cat's meow."
3,Movie,OK.................It's just ok for a Jack Nicholson movie...I've seen better....I've seen worst..thats all I have to say...Thanks for Alo\\llowing me to view my opinion...
4,a crazy comedy,"This isn't so much a Western as it is a crazy comedy, with screwball characters, lots of mugging, wild behavior, funny situations and twists, and a great cast featuring the young Mary Steenburgen and John Belushi, as well as Jack Nicholson, Danny deVito, and Christopher Lloyd.A fun romp."
4,A must see,This came quickly and I love this movie. Jack Nicholson at his best.I only wish I could get this on DVD.
4,buyer,excellent renditions of christmas carols with a couple of original songs also. any four tops fan would find it a must for holiday listening
1,Lacks depth and originality,"Most of the excerpts used in this book were obtained from the more popular civil war figures and authors routinely used in civil war documenteries and movies. The book's lack of originality reflects either disinterest or lack of knowledge of the civil war. Also, the book's title does not reflect the content. Readers interested in learning about the civil war are better off watching the documenteries and movies on television or actually reading the original books most of the excerpts were obtained from."
2,Bulb not working after 6months,"The product worked well for 6 months. It does small like UV light, liek a tanning bed...Unfortunately the bulb stopped working after 6 months. I contacted the seller Air and Water Inc. - Lets see whtehr they can replace and at what cost but it is a hassle...."
5,Trim and Tone Fast lives up to its name,This dvd is unique because you can choose from 5 different workouts or complete all of them for a great 60 min workout. When I'm short on time I go straight for the 16 min full body section. Its an engerizing workout to spice up your regular routine.
4,a brief review,"Geoffrey Abbott provided a rather exhaustive review of the methods that have been used to carry out the most extreme punishment. The book is set up in alphabetical order (starting with the axe and ending with twenty-four cuts). Most readers will be familiar with some of the methods (hanging, gas chamber, firing squad) while others are much less well known (tied in a sack with animals, diele, keel-hauling, etc). The ""chapters"" for the more well known methods are much longer than the rest; several chapters are a page or less. Abbott provides some details about both the method and its history. The book definitely has a Euro-centric feel to it."
5,Love it,Unforgettable memories from great times with these touching interpretations. Good to experience quality in music and romanticism. Thanks Jose Jose
5,Wicked and enjoyable romp!,"I thought this was a very light and entertaining read, pure escapism. Princess Hedra, rather than waiting for her prince to find her, goes out and finds him, and meets a few interesting characters along the way. Fantasising about a castle where she can do whomever whenever she wants, she finds out she is living the reality. The only problem, although not really a problem, is that they have a hard time keeping up! Satyria is a kingdom used to desire being an open thing, and so is carrying them out. Whereas she is from one where IT is not done at all. Surprised at her innitiative, then pleased, she is gladly welcomed as their new mistress. But things are not smooth sailing, when Satyria is threatened by the same king that overtook her home country. Willing to stand up the the depraved and decadent king, she agrees to the deal that she must make three of his loyalist knights to pledge their loyalty to her. Will she succeed?"
1,yuck,this book had so much potential a historic setting medevil times no less fantasy creatures and lots of sex but I could not enjoy this book because for one too much bdsm which I dispise second she was made into a slave by a knight who was a monster save your money I wish I had
5,BEST HAMLET EVER,"Nichol Williamson is brilliant in this movie. It's not as popular as the Mel Gibson or Kenneth Branagh versions, at least here in America, but that should hardly keep you away from it. The only thing that might put off first time viewers is that it's obviously an adaptation from a stage production, so, for example, you don't get to see the ghost (I don't want to see some Hollywood idiot dressed up in some ridiculous costume and CGI'd up). But what a cast! Anthony Hopkins, Marianne Faithful, et al...Shakespeare done the way it should be. I hope you'll be patient with it and really sit down and appreciate this version. Very much worth every minute of it."
2,Dull version of Hamlet,"This has got to be one of the worst versions of Hamlet ever filmed.Williamson,who plays Hamlet,must be about ten years older than Parfitt,who plays his mother the queen. He also must be one of the worst,wimpiest actors to ever play hamlet. Not only is this movie badly filmed,it is also incredibly dull. The only decent actor in this movie is Marianne Faithfull. She is perfect and lovely as Ophelia. The only interesting scene in the film is when Ophelia goes mad."
5,Medicine Moms,"I just received this book as a gift and loved its common sense approach to homeopathy. Its pages are filled with concise information in an easy to read format, and covers all our common ailments. For newcomers to homeopathy (Medicines best kept secret!!) or anyone wanting to approach homeopathy with an open mind - this book has it all and more!!"
4,Very easy to follow and prepare,"I just downloaded this, and have not yet tried the recipes(hence 4 rather than 5 stars), but I know I will like this one. Miss Leslie began her cookbook with an explanation of measurements that are easily followed, and states specifically that she wrote this so that all could use it regardless of their level of cooking and of their economic status in 1840. I do believe their quality of yeast was somewhat less than it is today (I'm not using a wineglass full of yeast to make 12 rolls), but the directions are simple, and most of the ingredients are not difficult to find.Once I have made a few of these recipes, I will follow with another review.Cheers, and happy cooking!"
4,What's left,"I've waited for so long for this to be released but there are some major disappointments in what is missing. No Stoneground, no Sons Of Champlin, great songs replaced by jams. Went to all the last shows but one and this does capture the closing of the Fillmore West (not to be confused with The Fillmore) in a somewhat clinical maner. No matter what you do, there is really no way to fully cature any event. I remember being somewhat disappointed when this movie originally came out. It's still a good movie, just not as good as it could have been."
2,Not the Movie I Saw in the Theaters,"I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters and it was a great send off for the Filmore West.All these years I waited for a video release and got it the day it came out.Its been over 30 years and I didn't remember who all was in the movie but I WAS looking forward to the long Jam of Boz Scaggs'""I'll Be Long Gone"", which took my breath away.For whatever reason, it wasn't there....a BIG dissappointment. the performances included are nicely done in 5.1 but it lost a lot of it's magic with the ""missing performances"". If you are curious about the whole Filmore scene and the band's that made it the venue it was , then by all means purchace this DVD. If you are dissappointed with the DVD try to find the CD 2-disc set. You won't be dissappointed there ."
2,A disappointment,"Although it was nice to see a few of the more obscure bands from that era, and the Hot Tuna, Quicksilver Messenger Service, and Grateful Dead segments were done well, I was eagerly looking forward to seeing Carlos Santana's performance with his original band lineup. What a disappointment! The person who filmed that segment must have had a grudge against Carlos, because there was not a single shot of him playing - only the other members of the band were shown during the set. Someone should have taken the camera away from that guy, smacked him upside his head, and filmed the guy who the band was named after!I certainly don't think that this DVD was what I thought it would be. Avoid it."
3,why no Boz?!!,"The most dynamic performer is left out of the movie, tempting me to return it for poor product advertising. Boz is sorely missed and has a lot of fans in this neck of he woods. We were all set to enjoy his performance and it never came...Otherwise the material is how I remembered it with Hot Tuna being one of my favorites."
2,LOOK ON EBAY FOR THE ORIGINAL,"THE COMPLETE ORIGINAL VHS IS AVAILABLE ON DVD ON EBAY...I HAVE EM....PRETTY GOOD QUALITY...ITS A DARKLY LIT MOVIE...BUT ITS ALL THERE....NOW LETS SEE THE FILM FROM CLOSING NITE AT FILLMORE EAST....IT WAS FILMED, BUT NEVER RELEASED...ALSO JIMI HENDRIX AT THE HARLEM STREET FAIR FILMED BY THOSE 2 BROTHERS....OR HENDRIX FILLMORE EAST '68 WAS ALSO ON FILM....O WELL...WHEN IN NEW YORK CITY---TRY GENERATION RECORDS ON THOMPSON ST IN THE VILLAGE.....TONS OF UN RELEASED STUFF...."
2,For Very Young Toddlers Only,"I was too quick to click buy when I saw ""Hooked on Phonics."" My 4 and 6 yr old are bored to tears by this. It's very simplistic, both in the style, music, stories and visually. So far we've only tried the animal disk and each segment is so short, most with NO VALUE for a child who can already identify animals. Like the segment where a bunny hops around feeding various farm animals, the only time words are said is to identify each animal. No words show up on screen in that segment at all. THERE IS NO PHONIC LEARNING AT ALL. The children photographed on the DVD cases look to be 5-7 yr old, which is very misleading. I think this would serve the same age group as the Baby Einstein videos. Only when my boys were that age I liked the Baby Einstein videos a lot more than what I've seen of this set. I'm sorry I bought this. I gave it two stars (instead of one) because it was my mistake for not researching it more, but compared to Baby Einsteins this is a joke."
4,Kid pleasing....,My son loves these videos! He's had them for over a year or so (he is 4.5). He really enjoys them now that he is in preschool and is excited about learning! He especially loves the Fun In Motion video. His name is Aaron like the narrating character...that gives it an extra special appeal for him!
3,Not for Phonics Learning,"What one would want to know before buying this product? Hooked on Phonics is the the brand name in this case not what the product is for. Hooked on Phonics is a brand name that teaches all different classroom subjects and skills like math, sign language, spanish, study skills, and so forth. This set is a Pre-K prep to give your toddler a head start on some kindergarten skills not one of the company's sets that teaches actual phonics (letters and the accurate sounds they each make). If you want phonics you need to choose another Hooked for Phonics product orLeap Frog - Letter Factory."
2,Just okay,"I bought these DVD's for my 2 year old son, who is obsessed with learning. Letters, colors, numbers, objects, you name it, he loves it. I thought these DVD's would be perfect, especially after reading the reviews. I was really disappointed, and my son hated them. There is a mix of animated characters and real children, and the video quality isn't the best. I couldn't return the DVD's since we had already opened and watched them, but for the same price I got himLeapFrog: Learning DVD Setwhich he absolutely loves. He will watch the Leapfrog movies over and over again and sing along with the songs. I would highly recommend those over this Hooked on Phonics set."
5,education first,came in on time and education is first my first purchases were educational items then clothes shoes etc I cannot wait to educate my child and watch her grow intellcultaly
5,"Tangible, ""how-to"" methods for influencing motivatation!","Having read many books on motivation and leadership in the work place, I can't think of one that ""hits home"" as close as this one.Its conversational, no-nonsense tone takes the reader through theory and application in an effective, easy-to-understand way. How refreshing to actually be able to understand the complexity of Theory X and Theory Y! And, not only that, but to be able to begin generating practical ideas as you read this book for your own work environment!The format's quick tips and chapter highlights add valuable impact that keeps the reader thoroughly engaged. The book examines some of the world's most admired companies and their unique approaches to developing people and influencing positive motivation and overall morale.As a senior manager for one of America's largest financial institutions, I highly recommend this book. I'm very eager to get started on the other books in this series."
2,Ouch!,"These shoes are horrible. they look cute but they do a number on your feet, i wore them in a wedding and we all had the same shoes and we were all three in horrible pain. they were all ditched before the reception and now i have a expensive pair of shoes waiting in my closet for me never to wear them again..... dont buy them unless you like pain!"
3,Decent price & delivery,Price & delivery speed were both good. I used to listen to the group years ago. I had never heard of this particular album and really didn't care much for it.Will try to watch for other albums by them.Taz18
2,No competition for Russell,"This is a nice, easy going book. However the claim which the book makes on the cover that it, ""supplants all others, even the immensely successful 'History of Western Philosophy' by Bertrand Russell,"" is absurd. Russell has a deep understand of philosophy, Gottlieb does not. This book is a superficial (but enjoyable) account of philosophy up to the Renaissance. If you've already read Russell (or have otherwise studied philosophy), this book is of little value. If you have not, reading Gottlieb might encourage you to read the real thing."
3,Makes reading a toy.,"My son has lots of fun playing with the interactive toys at the bottom, but the book isn't that exciting to him. I started reading this book to him when he was 4 months old, showing him the pictures and asking him the questions. At 18 months, he only wants to shut the book and play with the toys. I wish that the toys were integrated into the message of the book, not just toys to play with while I show him unrelated pictures and concepts."
4,FUN,"We bought this to look at during a five hour plane ride. My 14 month old son loves looking at the ""real"" pictures of babies in this book. It definitely kept him entertained for awhile. The activity bar is pretty boring and the book would be just as fine without it. Also, it is a big book so it is kind of hard for him to handle on his own. Overall, this book (and the other happy baby books) are great purchases!"
5,A Must-Read for Every Frenchie Owner,"You owe it to your French Bulldog to read this book. Never have I seen so much technical information presented in such an enjoyable, easy to read manner-- and with such delightful illustrations! Read this book before you obtain a French Bulldog, it will educate you extensively as to the issues concerning this breed, and will help the prospective owner know what to look for when searching for a healthy Frenchie. It truly is an owner's manual that no Frenchie owner should be without. Highly recommended!"
4,Important information for all new comers to the breed,Great book-a must have for All people who are seriously considering this breed. Detailed health issues about the breed that gives potential french bulldog seekers good questions to ask when looking for a quality breeder.A+++++ rating!
3,Comprehensive Health Care for French Bulldogs,Excellent book! Thoroughly recommend this book to all current and future frenchie owners. Pass it to your vet when you finish reading it.
5,Another Winner!,"'Rescue' carries on the series' tradition of choice excerpts (19) from well-and lesser-known authors. Therein lies the beauty of this series - I had never heard of Spike Walker (!) but after reading the riveting excerpt in 'Rescue' I ran out and bought both his books. Two of the selections are fiction, not my taste, but the other 17 tales of peril, shipwrecks, avalanches and plane crashes will have you reading all night. The stories range from professionals who take one risk too many to everyday folks who find themselves over their heads without warning. A great gift book for anyone who thrives on adventure and especially if you you know someone in search/rescue or the Coast Guard. Get all the books in this series - I have and I love 'em!"
5,"Great old-world product, bargain price!!!","It is rare to see a manufacturer who consistenely makes great products like Diogini does. The bag is fantastic and caries all I need when traveling or going to the office and looks suitible for both. The quality of the leather is superb, in fact I liked it so much I just ordered another one."
3,I had high hopes for this bag,"Unfortunately, those have been dashed. This bag isn't even two years old and is showing severe signs of wear. I use it almost daily and part of the side that hugs my body has turned from brown to gray, and the leather is literally beginning to rip. I'm quite disappointed. I had my eye on this bag for a year, and finally received it as a college graduation gift; however, I doubt it will be accompanying me to graduate school, which was the plan for allowing my parents to spend $295 on a messenger bag."
3,Rita Davenport,"Ok, not really what I thought it would be. I had a book like this but misplaced it. This one seems smaller, but it will do."
3,The second DVD has no image...,"I got these DVDs about two months ago, the first one everything is OK but the second DVD has no image. I can hear all the interviews but see nothing. Haw I do to return it and get another one OK ? Moderate quality; the chronology is a little messed . I would like so much to have one good biography of MJ that would show things happening in a chronologic manner, with the right images ( Say... things that happened in the time of ""Bad"" showing him as he was during that time...you know what I mean?)Well, comparing to some of the other DVD I acquired lately, this is moderate quality."
5,help me find dvd,can you please let me know where you found the 30th anniverasie concert on dvd? i can not find it any where.
5,It's a matter of what you want,"My use of harmonium is for playing the devotional chants of Paramahansa Yogananda (published by Self-Realization Fellowship). Yogananda styled his compositions in Western musical notation, hence playing them on the harmonium is easy since a standard piano keyboard setup is used.Sandra Batish is rightly and accurately lavish in her praise of both Pandits for their introductory work on this DVD. I look for more to come; but on the other hand I use their music to assist in my devotional meditative efforts; especially refreshing and helpful to me are Ashwin's ragas for morning meditation.I say forthrightly to Ashwin and the Batish family, ""keep on keeping on!"" The world needs such as you at a time such as this."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!,I thought WE6 was one of the best games ever. This version is not. The players you control re-act much to slow. You must anticipate every move 3 steps in advance. If you loved WE6 be wary of this one. RENT FIRST.
5,yu gi oh is the best,i feel that this game will be a hit from what i have been observing about this game this games dueling style is supposed to be like worldwide edition and that's why i like this game
5,"Amazing music for headphones, dance, driving ... whatever","Rhythm, melody, ambiance, dance, headphones, driving ... turn it up and let the music move you! An excellent production by Soulfood."
5,Brain Enhancer,Wingmakers music is actually mind and brain enhancing technology. Close your eyes and let it bring you up into your higher brain. Chambers 1-9 set you up for the first step...chamber 10. In the middle of 10 part two is a percussion session that will thrill and educate you. Listen to where it is coming from and watch your brain change.
1,A lot of hype,"I purchased Professor Franklin's Photo Print Gold after weeding through the many different photo print progams. I was looking for something easy to use and would allow me to edit my pictures with photo effects. It stated on the box a 'ten minute guarantee' if I was not printing my favorite pictures with ease. Well, 2 hours later I was still trying to retrieve my pictures and print them. I was thrown off the program 5 times for illegal operations. My husband and I had a hard time understanding their 'easy' directions, which were incomplete and confusing. I finally gave up after my computer froze (this is a new computer). I do not recommend this software. Even their money back guarantee is vague because it only states it on the outer box- it is difficult to find in the booklet enclosed."
4,Wedding Photo Album,"This is a very beautiful photo album.....I wanted something that could take pictures vertically and horizontally, which you can but you must turn the photo album according to your picture. I just needed two different photo albums. It is very nice and very beautiful. Delivery was good and packaging was very nice."
2,Cheap,"I didn't care for this product. I thought it was cheap looking. The black around the roses and leaves was much darker than the picture shows. I bought this as a wedding gift, and was embarrassed to give it. I wouldn't have bought this product, had I seen it first. The picture makes it look a lot better than it really does."
3,Just SMASH HITS reissued--nothing expanded,"Don't understand why they couldn't have added more of his big songs on this reissue, since they've basically renamed it. This is a typical lazy effort in this whole 20th Century Masters-Best of-Millennium Collection series. And could it have more subtitles? Tracks:1. purple haze (2:52)2. fire (2:45)3. the wind cries mary (3:21)4. can you see me (2:33)5. hey joe (3:30)6. all along the watch tower (4:00)7. stone free (3:36)8. crosstown traffic (2:19)9. manic depression (3:42)10. remember (2:48)11. red house (3:50)12. foxy lady (3:19)"
1,Only good thing - Charles Castronovo's voice,"As much as I love this opera, this production was awful. I do not mind modern stagings but this one was just too weird. Such a pity because Charles Castronova has a gorgeous voice and is an excellent actor. What a waste of such an incredibly talented opera singer."
1,POBRE MOZART!!!,"Esta puesta en escena de Stefan Herheim, deforma completamente la obra, hace cambios en el libreto a su regalado gusto y utiliza la música de Mozart, para darle vida a su inmoral historia. Qué vergüenza Sr. Herheim, manténgase lo más alegado de Mozart el reto de vida que le queda!!!"
2,A nightmare,"First of all let me tell this: I love new ideas about theater, opera, arts in general. Really love it... but this SERAIL is a kind of joke without taste. Where is the original idea about the mix of cultures and the battle of sexes written by Mozart? Nowhere. Just a joke about SERAIL without SERAIL. A nightmare... Poor Mozar! What happenened with Salzburg? The two stars of my rating are for the voices and the orchestra."
1,wiped clean of all meaning,"I won't give a diatribe about the indecency of this production, the fact that there is some full frontal nudity on stage is not my objection. My problem is that the story has been completely stripped away in this production. The opera, as it was written, has a plot which may be silly, but which gives us an idea of 18th century European attitudes towards sex, intimacy and Eastern culture. In this production the plot is gone and the arias have been used as the basis of a set of essentially unrelated set pieces supposedly giving us insights into the nature of sexual relationships. The irrelevant action on stage simply distracts from the drama of Mozart's skillfully constructed arias and recitatives. The result is supposed to give a provocative view of sexuality, but to me seems to be utter foolishness. To sum up, if this sounds interesting, you might want to buy this DVD, but don't expect it to be a reasonable representation of the opera as Mozart conceived it."
3,What can I say...............,I dont really know how to rate this movie. It was a little wierd. Kind of dissapointed.... But it was ok........
2,Swept Away,"""Swept Away"" frustrated me because it had the potential to be a great movie if the story had been developed more from the emotional, character refining perspective while the couple was on the deserted island. Madonna should really stick to singing and leave the acting to others. The only reason I keep this movie is for the melancholy, haunting music (Speigel im Speigel) at the end of the film. That piece makes it all worthwhile."
3,Conspiracy in Entertainment Industry to Keep Madonna Down!,"I have never seen a movie get such bad reviews. Then again, I have never seen reviews that were so badly written and done out of spite and jealousy rather than objectiveness. I thought Swept Away had some faults: Madonna's acting, in the first half of the film, is awful; it is too politically incorrect for some audiences; and the script, especially in the beginning, suffers as well. However, not only does Madonna's acting improve throughout the movie, but the film traps the viewer, makes the viewer cry, and most importantly, makes the viewer think about the values in our society. If any other name had been associated to this film besides Madonna, it would have earned raves."
3,Not bad at all!,"I just saw this film for the first time today on DVD and I thought it was a very enjoyable film. I laughed out loud several times during the film and, yes, I was laughing WITH them not at them. Madonna does a fantastic job as portraying this snobby, mean-spirited rich wife and once she's stranded on the island, you eventually get to see her character grow as a human being which is always good. Adriano's character is an enjoyable one and his chemistry with Madonna works great. Also I want to mention that her female costars in the beginning of the film (Jeanne Tripplehorn & I'm unsure of the younger blonde actress's name) were colorful characters as well. Madonna is constantly slammed by certain critics and wrongfully they ganged up on her for this one as well. The movie also does not have a typical Hollywood ending but I did have to give the movie only 3 stars because the ending did feel a little rushed and I definitely wanted more. I'd love to see a sequel!"
3,How to enjoy Swept Away,"First off, this is no where near as bad as the critics made out. Second, do like we did, have a bad movie night, watch Glitter first, believe the critics and expect Swept Away to be even worse than Glitter, then get set to watch it with standards lowered. What the heck are they on about ? This movie was voted the worst of the year .... compared to Glitter its great, hilarious and as a bonus you get to see Madonna slapped around. Who wouldnt want to watch just to see that ? I'm not a fan of Madonna's music, never have been, and I expected this movie to be a shocker. Its not bad. I've also seen the original, over 20 years ago, from what I remember its not as violent either. This reminds me of the time every critic jumped onto the trash Battlefield Earth bandwagon, it wasnt ***that*** bad and neither is this."
2,one bad film leads to another....,"this is madonna's last time acting film...i don't really blame her. she continues to make really bad films and her acting just isn't that great. the plot was interesting...but the movie itself wasn't really all that special. plus, madonna does not age well in this movie. the wrinkles are starting to show on her face which make her look unflattering and old."
2,Better than I expected but I dislike the kowtowing to societal mores,"Saw the movie only because of the 1970s original. Pleasantly surprised at Madonna's acting -- previous movies had left me cold. However, very disappointed in lack of realism: how many people wear a full length sweater day in and day out on a warm deserted island? Or wear the same clothes for a month and have them look like new? No nicks, no tears, no nothing! How is it that we never see either of the two naked -- even when they are having sex? Last I checked I had to take *my* shorts and briefs off! And, the coup de grace, as far as I am concerned is hair -- growth -- the lack of, that is. After a month, neither of the two had any more hair than they started with -- head, face, underarms, legs, anywhere.Yes, modern societal mores may dictate that TV shows have women with shaven arms and legs having sex wearing underwear, but this is not a daytime soap. It's a R rated movie!"
2,entertaining,"Swept Away is by no means cinamatic genius, but it really is amusing. Madonna is DEAD ON in her portrayal of the elitist and demanding wealthy American woman....so dead on that you wonder how much of it is acting and how much it is chanelling the Madonna of the 1990s."
3,Not Bad At All,"I never went to see this movie when it first came out because it was so trashed by critics, I never gave it a chance. I decided to rent it a few days ago, and may I say, in my own opinion, this movie is not bad at all. Madonna gave an honest, believable performance, I give her alot of credit. Madonna, don't give up on acting yet!!!! Keep on trying, I know you will find your HIT sooner or later! Give this movie a chance....watch it and see."
3,Not At All Bad!,"Critics were bashing this movie before it was even released, causing it not to be released at all really in the United States, just because it stars Madonna and was directed by her husband Guy Ritchie. The only thing bad about this movie is the ending, which has nothing to do with the acting, rather the plot. It's worth watching alone just to see Madonna looking so drop-dead gorgeous, as always, in a bikini almost the whole movie."
2,What kept on being swept was his hand...,"Madonna is great as the obnoxious spoiled rich Amber. Adriano Giannini does a great job as Pepe, the fustrated target of Ambers sharp tongue. Although Amber does deserve a good taste of her own medicine, in which she does get her share when roles reverse, I felt a litte uncomfortable with the constant back handing that Madonna gets in this movie. She is smacked in the face, kicked, and shoved. No blood or gore, but I felt that it was unecessary. That is why I gave the movie 2 stars. I felt that Amber could learn her lesson without all that physical abuse."
3,"""It's not THAT bad.""","I wanted to see this movie because I thought it might make me laugh as hard as ""Showgirls"". But it didn't. I actually enjoyed this movie. Madonna isn't distractingly bad; and the relationship her character developes with the male lead is interesting and complex. The film never drags, and the scenery is gorgeous. I've read terrible reviews blasting everything about this movie. I have to say, it's not that bad. I was expecting the worst, and I was pleasantly suprised."
1,"I mean this, worst movie I have ever seen.","The dialogue in this movie is beyond atrocious, and at many times laughable. I do believe that Madonna can act, contrary to many other reviewers. However, her portrayal of the rich woman in this movie was so overdone and overwraught it was completely unbelievable. I also believe that Guy Ritchie has put out some good work. However, the acting in this movie is just so bad, you can't watch it.Watch this movie only if you'd like to be bored to tears, or if you need a laugh."
1,THAT LEAN $ HUNGRY LOOK,"I'm sad to have to break the news to Guy Ritchie & Madonna, but this movie is an almost total bomb. It completely lacked the passion and the splendor of the original ""Swept Away."" The original leading actress, Mariangela Melato, had a full breasted curvaceous figure that exuded a deep womanly sensuality. Unlike the lean and hungry look of an aging starlet whose grasp on pop culture (a culture that once fully embraced her warped sense of aesthetics and her shallow philosophy of materialism and selfishness) is simply slipping away like sand through an hourglass.As for the direction, well, there's not much to praise. Let me just say that it was less than inspired. In fact, the word tepid is what comes to mind. The original was, of course, breathtaking and much more insightful and character driven. Seeing this exploration into the mediocre makes me long for the days when trivial pursuit was not a lifetime ambition."
2,Don't waste money and time,"Don't waste money and time, wait until you have nothing else to watch, call your friends in and have a silly home movie watching night. The only thing I like about this movie is the breathtaking sunset and blue ocean, one star for that. The other star is for Madonna's short dancing and singing."
5,Madonna... a natural actress,"Madonna is great in her new movie....I invite you to enjoy the movie when you have a chance, forget the press. Madonna does not act, Madonna represents the part. Treasure this Star now that she is here with us, for she is our last one. A Big Fan."
2,Mediocre attempt at filmmaking by Guy Ritchie......,"I watched this one with a bit of caution. I was curious to see what the outcome would be. I liked Guy Ritchie's previous films, so I thought, despite all the bad press surrounding this film, I'd give it a shot. Well, here it goes...It was mildly entertaining, but it wasn't great at all. Madonna can't really act all that well, and needs to stick to her day job. She was great in ""A League of Their Own"", but in this particular film, you could tell she was trying really hard to make the best of it, but it just didn't work. The script by Ritchie was full of unbelievably corny scenes and bits of dialogue. The scene where Giancarlo Gianni and Madonna play charades in the cabin by the beach is unbearable...Other than all of that, the scenery is beautiful, and like I said, its mildy entertaining...enough so that you can make it through the entire film. BARELY make it through, rather.SKIP IT or watch if there is absolutly nothing else to choose from."
3,Not so bad !,"I've seen Swept Away in the movies in France and I was very surprised ! I don't understand all the hatred against this movie that I found pretty good. Madonna is far to be the best actress in the world but her performance here is not bad. The meditarranean landscapes are beautiful and the music is really splendid. And what to say about the end of the movie ? A very strong end !Don't listen to the critics, they hate Madonna... but she's still here and forever !"
1,Swept Away - Glimpse from Hell,"I finally have had a glimpse of hell watching this ... movie which should have gotten negative stars. Madonna, who's only decent acting job was as a female baseball player, just doesn't cut it. She should stick with her music, which is the best it's ever been, but watch this thing if you want to watch the most unintentionally funny movie in years, it's that bad."
1,"Madonna's Acting Career ""Swept Away""","Warning: Don't watch this movie while you're eating. Just the sight of Madonna's wrinkled face and mannish pecs(veins and all), will be vomit inducing. This is an hysterical bomb with horrendeous, self-conscious acting(?) by that Golden Raspberry award Champ Madonna. Just curious though why Cyndi Lauper's real life husband David Thornton was in this? He's a gifted actor who usually has some great roles in Nick Cassavetes' films. Well I guess You live and learn."
4,A tragic love story,"I think it can be agreed on that this movie was doomed before it was even released. Bad press and reviewers wanting to take their jab at Madonna's acting skills and ""suckering"" of Guy Ritchie to make a movie starring her killed it. But now that the dvd is out and i've had a chance to watch the movie, i have to agree with part amazon[.com]'s editorial review. Madonna does give the most believable performance of her career as Amber. Amazon[.com] does, however, say that the movie fails at making a valid point of the economics of capitalism, and this may be the case. I, though, did not watch this movie as a statement on capitalism, but as a love story. The style of the movie does change over and over again, and this is the only real flaw. The storyline flows fairly well, and the viewer can really see Amber and Giuseppe's relationship grow. From the funny beginning to the utterly heart wrenching end, this movie is very worthy of being viewed."
1,"Forgive me Father for I have sinned, I promise to say 'Hail Mary' until Madonna has a hit movie","Why is this movie so bad? ""Swept Away"" starts out boring and just gets worse and worse. I am not trying to trash Madonna's acting because heaven knows she's been called every name in the book already, but if this movie is any representation of her acting skills she should quit while she's ahead and go back to singing and dancing. Included on the DVD is the MTV special that Madonna did with her husband which is in all actuality better than the movie itself because Madonna seems more human and relaxed. I suppose all of the blame isn't Madonna's fault, but she's Madonna and she and her husband did produce it. I still love Madonna, just not this movie."
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"What can i say it was one of the most painfull movies i had to sit through in my life. Madonna can not act at all and she needs to stop with that horrid British Accent,STOP THAT! As for Guy Riche, I knows she is your wife and all but you can do better than this come on now come on. The only plus side to this so called movie is you get to see madonna get slaped."
1,Painful to watch,This is a terrible movie - if you want to see something good PLEASE watch the original. This is simply terrible. NONE of the interesting complexities are kept. This movie is TRITE in its performance. It doesn't have any direction - it doesn't know if it wants to be a comdey or drama. Madonna can NOT act and the most dramatic scenes are laughable due to her perfromance. Just see the original. Most of the dialog is inappropriate due to the era and the culture -- just let the Italians do it. This film is a waste and does the orginal a HUGE disfavor to its vision.
3,"not swept away, but blown away","I am an avid madonna fan, and have been for years. I will never say that her acting is worth awards, and have usually been with most when her acting is concerned. I did like her in Evita, and thought it was her best role ever, though still only decent...when i read the reviews for swept away, I thought it would be a horrible movie, yet watched just to say I had seen it, and see what the fuss was about. Yet, when i saw it, I was blown away. Guy Ritchie did wonders with this, and Madonnas acting was above what you would expect. I dont agree with most when it comes to this movie....I actually saw her as an actress, and not fake like usual. I would recommend it to anyone, but most would cringe at madonna and acting in the same sentence....but, please, give it a chance...I think you will like it."
2,disappointment,"God I love Madonna, but this movie was a not good. The last 15 minutes finally get interesting.. unfortunately it's the last 15 minutes, so the movie ends just when I started to care about these people.The script is terrible. The dialogue ridiculous, and Guy Ritchie's direction is disturbing. The biggest mystery is why anyone would even want to act, direct or film this movie at all.As usual the critics blamed Madonna, as if one person is responsible for either a great movie, or a terrible movie. Everyone involved in this project should have passed, and so should the audience."
1,Lousy.,"Geez, Guy Ritchi isn't much of a film director and his wife could use some acting lessons. A boring film. Not bad scenery. In fact I enjoyed the scenery more than the acting and plot. This film doesn't deserve a long review, good or bad."
2,Swept Away,"Ok, you can't even compare it to the awful Gigli(yuck).I sometimes rent the ones that get really bad reviews just for the humor value,and to see how bad they could be!- but Swept Away isn't so bad after all. Should have been movie of the week instead, BUT that being said, Madonna really gets into character, you can tell she really tried and it worked! (no Shanghai Surprise acting here)the scenery is beautiful, and there are some very funny moments."
4,"Better than expected, better than the expectation set","I just watched this movie last night. I have to say, I found myself emotional jerked by this movie. I was crying, appalled, laughing and uncomfortable. Madonna gets slapped I don't know how many times but it's kinda wierd. When the movie begins, Madonna's presence seems to override her character a bit. It's hard to explain but as the movie went along, you then saw the character develop. I liked the dance sequence the best, very sexy. That she pulled off perfectly on-accounta duh!! The movie did drag on a bit but it wrapped up in a way that is not typical. I liked it and am glad I purchased this DVD."
5,Excellent rendition of the classic latin ballads !!!!,"This definately the best ""BOLEROS"" album there is. The combination of Rocio Durcal's voice and Juan Gabriel's lyrics, make this an album you must have!!! The trio heard in this album is conducted by Benjamin Correa, who has recently worked with Luis Miguel and others who have made an effort to make a Bolero come-back. Rocio's album is the original ""Romances""."
4,My dad loves it,"My dad's always been interested in clocks; when I saw this book, I bought it for him for his birthday.I've received TWO emails telling me how much he's enjoyed it. :)"
3,Much more detail than the average reader needs.,"Too much detail for the casual reader. Seems to still apologize for Bradley's failure to realize the extent of the attack. Bradely was a great General, but he blew it in the Bulge and never admitted it."
4,small & cute,"Most of the time it takes good pictures. It seems every other picture comes out. For some reason the film pack says 10 exposures, but out of two packs I was only able to get 8 exposures per pack. But I love the compactness of it. And it's so cute. So far I've only seen it in Target stores, and they have marked them down after 2 months. I hope this camera will be around for awhile, not like the Handle Camera which I have also, without film."
3,it's fun and all but...,i also had a difficult time finding film as well. this camera was purchased for me off of my amazon.com wishlist but at the time the film wasn't in stock. so i had to try to locate some and eventually did at a camera store. so far the photos i have taken outdoors have turned out the best and at about a dollar a photo i think i'll just stick to taking photos outside.
2,Film is difficult to find,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift and wanted to include several packages of film with it since I've heard it's hard to find (not to mention rather expensive).I had a really difficult time getting Mio film even after a week or two of searching online and in stores. It doesn't seem that the film is readily available, or maybe the Mio just hasn't caught on yet. In any case, although the camera itself seems pretty cool, the headache of finding film was reason enough for me to return it and gift an APS camera instead."
1,Great pictures when it works...,"The camera takes really cute puctures when it works, but I only succeeded in making 4 pictures when it froze on me. The camera froze in the open position and could not be closed no matter what I did. I eventually tossed it because it gave me far more aggravation than pleasure. For example, turn it on and it stays on from 2 to 15 seconds, rather arbitrarily. You can set up a shot, and, boom!, the camera shuts down. Turn it on again and it fails to work. Shut it off, turn it on and then it might work (or not). I suspect the elecronics were not well thought out. Don't waste your money. This was an extermely frustrating experience for me!BTW: The manual, if one can call it that, is useless."
2,Would not recommend buying this camera,It took me weeks to find a place that sold the film for this camera. ... I have not used the camera and plan to return it. I have heard that every other picture turns out good. The points above suggest that buying the MIO is not a good investment.
1,sword,i dont like the people who sent me this because they sent me the wrong one and tell me to pay them to send it back.and as 4 the product i recieved it was terrible u can bend with one finger and the tang is a pencil thin thing that screws in the handle with a bolt. its a disgrace to real kantanas and fake katanas alike
1,cheap,cheap nut inside the hilt holds it together and comes loose not tight sacb the blade rust even if you clean it the right way i know because i had a professional clean it
3,Apologist History,"In The Roosevelt Presence, Maney does his best to justify and explain away issues relative to the New Deal, the Roosevelt administration, and various methods the Roosevelt administration created or implemented to solve various crises, chief among them economic difficulties in the `30s and war issues in the `40s. Maney clearly exposes his liberal, left-leaning stance by being critical of Roosevelt in certain areas but being supportive in other areas. As a historian, Maney should have presented the facts and let the reader decide. If Maney wanted to voice his opinion or other relevant personal position information, he should have included that in an introduction or in the endnotes. The fact that the University of California press published this book also speaks to the left-leaning position."
2,Our Fathers (DVD review),Our Fathers is a ok movie to watch. Not so sure if this movie will be very popular with the general audience though.
4,Thank you. The product very good,This product Lactaid-Fast Act recomendeed use all the persons because is very goodThank you
2,Wah,"Positives:(1.) If that's cruise ship life - count me out.(2.) Not likely to go to Jamaica either.(3.) Filming and locals spot role recruitment not bad for such a small crew. Well, a bit (OK, a lot) disjointed but mark that down to stylistic creativity.Negatives:(1.) If there's a meaningful or believable story here I couldn't find it.(2.) Acting and typecasting was too made-up/superficial.(3.) And the point was? Well, no point sometimes has it's value.(4.) Perhaps the point was ""Never wear green framed glasses!"""
5,Wah Do Gem,This movie is a whole lot of fun! It's a simple film graced with some very natural acting. Sean Bones is hilarious without really trying. Now that's comedy
3,It was alright,"There were some good scenes of gore, but it is in no way gorier than Dead Alive (Brain Dead). Meatball Machine is like a really demented Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie. All of the monsters look like bad guys from that kids show. The fighting between the monsters wasn't that great.I wasn't looking for a masterpiece, but I wasn't looking for a kids movie with gore added to it. Some of the bloody goodness was awesome. Heads split in half, eyes getting drilled out, and much more. The parasites that take over the humans are pretty cool looking too. It was worth the watch but not sure if I'll watch it again."
3,Meatball Machine,"Nothing can prepare you for MEATBALL MACHINE. Its insane comic book action and gore are only outmatched by its crude humor and sickening gross-outs. In it, a love-lorn teen discovers a mysterious piece of armor that transforms him and the girl he has obsessed over into berserk killing machines that must eat the hearts of other ""Necroborgs"" in order to survive. With everything from children being liquidated by oncoming traffic, to projectile vomit, to cross-dressing hookers, masturbation, and rape (both human and inhuman), the film pulls no punches in trying to shock and disturb its audience. The low-budget costuming and FX are surprisingly effective, mangling found objects into unrecognizable body armor and exaggerated bio-weapons. Fans of outrageously over-the-top Asian Horror films like MACHINE GIRL or TOKYO GORE POLICE cannot go wrong with this blood-splattered shocker!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
3,Was NOT impressed,"Back in 1992 Olaf lttenbach came out with a movie called ""The Burning Moon"" I've seen it. It wipes the floor when it comes to gore. ""The Meatball Machine"" was ok but I've was not really impressed. Heck the eyeball scene in ""Hostel"" was a whole lot better than the whole movie of ""Meatball Machine. I did like the concept of aliens taking over human bodys but that's been done before. I know it is very hard, very hard to find but if you can find a VHS copy (It isn't on DVD) ""The Burning Moon"" is the gore movie to see. As for ""Meatball Machine"", don't pay more than $2.00 for it."
3,One of the worst movies you'll ever own (and possibly like),"I bought this movie on a whim due to the line, ""'Plays like a gloriously bloody and R-rated version of the ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.""' --DVD Town""While the fighting is pretty cheesy like MMPR, the plot is deliciously weak, there's very little character development, and the ending makes absolutely no sense. Gore and (off-screen) tentacle rape drive the story on this one, in case you couldn't guess.The real stand-out feature is the drawn-out commentary from the cast. I could only make it through about 30 minutes of the commentary with a group of friends, but that's because the main point the whole cast was driving home was, ""We made the best movie we could with almost no budget, campy special effects, and an original cut that was so bad that a new director was called in to re-shoot parts of the movie."" - it was probably one of the best commentaries I've ever seen, especially after watching the movie."
2,Ken's review,"Was what i expected,B movie done pretty well, for there budget.A lot of special features."
1,Boy is this a Bad one,"Well I thought? with all the talk and reviews that this is a good movie, well I just have to say it is no doubt one of the worse B movies I have in my collection. The gore is awful like the rest of the movie, maybe if the movie was English and not English subtitles it might get two stars instead of one. Keep your money stay away from this one, I paid two much for it, I wouldn't even give this movie away for free."
4,Reject of Death was awsome,"So I just finished watching this, I was pumped about the great reviews and had just bought 'Machine Girl' and liked that alot, and was hopping for more blood and gore ext...... Hmmmm what to really say......?If you watch the original short first and then watch film it will make it so much better o_O I was a bit disappointed in the over all movie, it lacked something I just don't know what it is.Anyway 'Reject of Death' was awsome, if it had not been for that short film and I suppose it's the prequel to Meatball Machine, I would have given only 1 star maybe 2, sorry everyone who really enjoyed it, but thank God for Reject of Death, it made it worth buying the DVD.Reject of Death I give 5 stars, It disturbed me, it made me LOL, and cry because it ended and was way to short, but I guess that's why they call it a short. Buy it just for Reject of Death."
5,Lovely Scarf,This is a wonderful scarf with dragonflies on black. I love this company there things are so nice and always ship quickly.
2,Don't Assume Anything From The Photo,"This is just a standard dry DVD cleaner. The photo makes it look like a wet-type cleaner, but that's a cleaning spray for your TV screen. Big deal, I use Windex. Also, directions say not to use it on CD players or computers, which isn't in the product description."
3,"Oddly disappointed, given the high quality of the writing","I have always enjoyed Bill Moody's writing and his ability to make his characters absolutely real. Unfortunately, I figured out the identity of the murderer far too early in this book for my tastes.If you enjoy well-written prose, by all means read this book. But if the mystery itself is more important to you, I suggest you choose one of Moody's other excellent novels instead."
1,Bird Deserves Better,"Okay, the premise of a dedicated jazz fan killing Kenny G clones is funny. But that's about all that's worthwhile here. Just as Kenny G shouldn't have insulted the memory of the great Louis Armstrong by releasing a duet with him, Bill Moody shouldn't drag Charlie Parker into this book. The characters are wooden, the dialog is awkward and unnatural, the holes in the plot are impossible to overlook. This is my first Bill Moody book, and it will surely be my last."
4,Just what I was looking for.,"These are well made and very durable. I think they were a little on the spendy side, but I don't mind paying for quality tools."
5,Lovin' It!,"Not just your run of the mill compilation or tracks you know thrown together on a single CD.Its a great album. Lots of fun. Sexy, Soulful, Grinding....get it!"
4,"Wonderful, spacious, organized.","i bought this bag for my Dell XPS 13 ultrabook (12.1"" chassis) and fits perfectly fine. if you're a freak like me who wants multiple compartments, small zips, pouches, etc, then i'd highly recommend this product. its sturdy at the same time not too heavy, has place for practically anything and everything. looks professional and decent. i've not started using this product regularly yet, but i'm pretty sure i'll be more than satisfied. it's also well padded, partly hard shelled. my only concern is it might not stay upright on the floor without a support/wall, but since i dint have anything inside the bag, i wish that be reason. quite satisfied with this bag for the price and quality. if someone i know wants to buy a decent, not so expensive case for a small laptop, i'd definitely suggest this one!!"
4,Great for mini notebooks!,"Smaller and easier to handle than my previous briefcase and with the hard bottom, stands on it's own very well. I have a 10"" notebook that fits perfectly in the padded compartment. It carries a few files, a couple of magazines, CD/DVD's and a paperback nicely. The compartment for supplies like pens, flash drives and business cards is small, but sufficient, unless you like to carry your entire office with you. Fits well over the handle of my luggage and is built tough. The one downside is that there really isn't enough room for the power supply if I carry a book and a couple magazines."
3,VD saved this one too!!!!,"As the greatest D'Onofrio fan (me again)...I was very taken with his performance...(He's good no matter who he is!!) I must tell you...he really saves many of these movies...and he did this one.If you like alot of sex, this is it, but all in all....sex is better in a dream!!"
3,soul-searching film..,"quick review: single in New York, struggling to pay a debt, Claire is forced into escorting to pay off her debt. Along the way she falls for a cabbie driver. The film deals with her trying to decide what lifestyle she wants to continue... escorting or a normal life with a loving relationship. The ending I thought was surprising...the actress who plays Claire, Katrin Cartlidge, is in almost every scence, so it's basically a character study of her life. She gave a great performance."
5,Not a bad recipe yet!,"I purchased this book as a gift, we have owned one for years. It has been our ""go to"" cookbook since WE received it as a gift a while back. The first section has color photos of each recipe, and tells the page to find them. Well arranged & easy to understand."
2,I wanted to give it more stars,"I really wanted to award Martin Schenk more than two stars for this novel. It started off so promising. I actually read the entire first half in one night, just because I couldn't put it down. Really great characters (even though they were a bit stereotypical) were engaged in an original and believeable tragedy of greed and media hype. Then...I started the last half. It was so predictable, and by the time I was nearing the end, I was actually skipping paragraphs at a time just because the writing was so overdramatic and absurd, I couldn't wait to finish. The entire ""revenge of the roots"" storyline almost made me laugh out loud. Martin Schenk could have done SO much more with this novel. He definitely has talent, as was apparent in the first half. I just wish he would have used his talent in the second half."
2,"started off good, then a disappointment.","What happened with this book. It almost seemed as though the first half and the second half were written by two separate authors. The writing started off crisp and thrilling, then disintigrated into cardboard characters, silly happenings and a totally ridiculous ending. What, no one else in this little town (except for Andie's brother) noticed that people were suddenly dying at an unexpected rate? And the editing was sloppy, which was a surprise considering this came from a major publishing house. At one point Andie laments the fact that she ""can't lift one eyebrow at a time"", and later she ""arches an eyebrow""; then Velocover is capitalized at the first mentioning and not capitalized at the second. In all, this was a disappointment, and by the time I was finished I was wondering why I'd bothered."
1,A crappy place.,This was a poorly written piece of junk. The 2nd half of the story does not fit with the first half at all. It's like a completely different story. Andromeda's revenge is as cheesy as it gets. There is nothing even mildly creepy here. My father and I got more laughs out of listening to it than anything. At least it was only a quarter at a yard sale!
3,Exciting and Fun,Not much to add to the other reviews...I really enjoyed the 1st half but thought the 2nd half didn't really fit in with the rest of the story. Overall a fun read that I have recommended several times. 1st half of the book: 5 stars. 2nd half of the book: 2 stars. The biggest problem: this author hasn't written anything else since!!
5,Terrific! I was both tantalized and terrified.,"A quick, compelling read that I found extremely well-written. The author has a good, clear voice that sheds light on the terror lurking within ""A Small Dark Place."" Even though I was creeped out by the evil antagonist (I don't want to give anything away so I won't say who or what it is), I was also weirdly attracted to (him/her/it). This multi-dimensionality of character made the tale so much more believable and interesting for me. The plot moved swiftly and sucked me in, and at one point even made the hair stand up on the back of my neck (and I don't even have hair on the back of my neck)! I also really liked the author's occasional injections of wry humor, which were delightfully on target. I look forward to reading more from this demented new talent."
5,"Our kids love this one, and so do I!","We had the great luck to hear Timmy Abel in concert twice, and our whole family loves his music. We have played and re-played this music in our car traveling, and evn the adults enjoy it, although it is certainly a children's album. I frequently find myself singing ""Kindergarden Wall"" in my mind. This one's a winner."
3,Where's the End?,"I've loved the Residents for a while now, and while I love some of their material more than others, as a whole they are one of my favorite bands/artists. I followed the Bunny Boy shorts as they were released and was drawn into the bizarreness of it. So I couldn't wait to watch the dvd and see it all as one piece. So I was pretty upset that the entire final act, with Bunny in Arkansas, was cut from the dvd. Why would they do that? And why have I not noticed anyone else mentioning this? I'm starting to wonder if I got a faulty dvd.."
4,Not as sharp as regular blades,"I have two schnauzers, one with soft curly hair and the has wiry hair. The blades do not cut as well as regular blades on either dog."
3,"Requires some selective reading, but thought provoking","As the introduction indicates, skip the first chapter unless you really know nothing of the Middle Ages. Besides being dated and intensely opinionated the chapter contains sweeping generalizations with no support and factual errors, particularly regarding armor. Later chapters are much improved. Sources are noted (though they could use more variety) and statements of opinion, which are numerous, are generally noted in the first person.Despite these issues, French Chivalry has much to offer. It's a great overview of a number of sources, and takes an easily comprehended view of chivalry from the perspectives of the church, proponents of courtly love, and from knights themselves. It's a good introduction to the topic, being more accessible than Maurice Keen's excelent work ""Chivalry."""
5,don`t just stand there,"first of all...this is ""NOT"" a heavy metal band, this is AOR/melodic rock, ala Bon Jovi, Glass Tiger, Honeymoon Suite,Loverboy, just to mention a few.this is very melodic keyboard based rock, listen to songs like: ""dance desire"" ""black and blue"" ""fire"", for a starter.if you like AOR/melodic rock----this is a must for your collection."
2,In Search of More Poetic Prose in a Thriller,"I am an author and I love thrillers. My biggest disappointment in today's world of adventure fiction is the inability to find a mesmerizing adventure constructed with poetic and living prose which allows me to feel the southern Louisiana heat, smell the toasted bagels in a Manhattan deli or wince along with the facial expressions of a lawyer caught ambulance chasing in the hospital room of a critically injured patient. While a better yarner than Turow, this author's works lack the sort of living color which fiction demands. I recently discovered an author who accomplishes this and a thriller in which he does it. The author is Gary Wickert, and the book is DARK REDEMPTION. I didn't find it yet on Barnes & Noble, but it has just been released and it is available on Amazon.com. If you like this author's storylines, but want to be riveted to and made love to by the prose which are the building blocks of any piece of fiction....READ 'DARK REDEMPTION'."
5,a successful path to make atomic bomb as usa,"from a film which records usa make atomic bombs during world war II, there is a team leader, a 1 star general have a civil engineering degree. he successfully leading his team to make two atomic bombs, he must have the concept of atomic micro quantum mechanics, but his education is in civil engineering. it is that he has the knowledge of civil engineering structural dynamics, i.e. structural vibration, and wave motion in elastic solid, these two subjects shape the tools and solid and naked eyes seeing concepts for how the electron wave act inside atom. this is why civil engineering structural dynamics and wave motion in elastis solid give a successful path for learning micro quantum mechanics."
1,If only it kept time. Not dependable at all!,"Over a lifetime of owning and wearing several watches covering the full spectrum of costs and styles, I've never experienced a watch this unreliable. The Regatta is a handsome watch, that comes in a meticulous package. Everything would be perfect, expect for the fact that it doesn't keep time. This watch loses time, not by seconds a day, but in whole chunks. A half hour here, an hour there; whenever I would look at the watch, I couldn't really know what time it was. Shameful!An automatic watch should be able to keep time when worn 24/7. This one doesn't, so it's going back. Thank g-d Amazon is reliable, even if the watch isn't."
4,The quality of the Sturhling 161.33111 divers watch.,"The Sturhling men's Regatta Automatic Divers' watch, looks good on the wrist and is very comfortable as well. The band is as comfortable as it is secure. So far I've found the watch to be very accurate, but it's necessary to keep it wound up (by wearing it). It will keep going through a normal night's sleep, but not if you sleep in too long! The self-winding mechanism is noiseless, in contrast to the rather expensive Seiko watch I used to wear, which made a distinctly audible whirring noise. I'm very happy with my purchase of the Sturhling watch."
4,3.5 stars- -good characters and atmosphere; stilted dialogue.,"The first 100 pages of the book had me worried. The prose is not always engaging, and the dialogue can be excruciatingly repetitive: ""Come."" ""No."" ""Come on."" ""I won't."" ""Come with me."" ""I refuse."" ....AAARGH! I suppose that the characters' stubbornness is meant to be charming, but I just found that it made the story drag.Fortunately, the book is saved by its charming hero. I had gotten so used to misogynistic alpha male heroes that I forgot that there was any other kind! White Eagle is so sweet and loving and loyal that you can't help but sigh. The fact that the romance between hero and heroine started in their childhood made it feel all the more genuine.The setting of the story is also rich with Blackfoot culture. If you're looking for a story in a Native American/frontier setting and you like your heroes sweet and romantic, then this is for you."
5,"Wonderful, Delightful!! A Great Heart-Felt Story...",Katrina and White Eagle are wonderful characters who found each other a second time in a lifetime. This book is full of surprises. I've enjoyed reading this book and I recommend reading it. I find I'm still thinking about Katrina and White Eagle. What a story!! Karen Kay is still my favorite - one of my favorite Authors....
1,Not very interesting,"Actually kind of predictable. . Different people same plot. I like stories about Indians as far as I am concerned they are the bravest , but the story was kind of weak."
3,white eagles touch,"interesting, but not to exciting, but well writen. i will still get more of her booksshes agood auther and i have a lot of her books."
3,Nice look at history,I have read all three books in this series. I like the history of the west and the series gives an interesting look at this particular Indian tribe. The romance is sometimes not very believable. I enjoyed the series but they are not books I would read again.
2,Great! (when it works),"I initially had a great time with GoLive. Having never used an industrial strength web dev environment, I was a little intimidated. Without going through the training or documentation, I was able to figure out everything, with a little help from Google.Then, the crashes started. Crashes when I close files. Crashes when I open files. Crashes when I do _anything_. A GLCS2 reinstall fixed it, but not for long.I would have given it 4-5 stars otherwise, because when it works, it works great. As it stands, I more ""suffer through it"" than I actually ""use it""."
1,A pretty piece of crud,"I want to like this program. I've been very patient with it through many versions and upgrades, but this latest version is so full of bugs and quirks that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone! In theory GoLIve is great. But, like an enabler in a bad relationship, I've learned workarounds, and weird working habits just to keep the program from crashing. I'm actually pretty patient and methodical--I shudder to imagine what using this program would be like for a novice user. Don't waste your money--this is total junk!"
1,Don't put ANY money into ANY version on ANY platform of GoLive!,"GoLive CS2 gets ZERO stars. Having worked with GoLive since 2003 on Macintosh, in February 2007 I upgraded to CS2 -- piece of crapola -- big mistake. ""1 star"" is one too many!GoLive used to be a nice program. Whether you are an old user or thinking of getting it anew, don't. I regret upgrading to GoLive CS2 -- and Adobe won't make it right granting suckers like me a $200 upgrade to Dreamweaver (vs. $400). Adobe offers GoLive 9 via their website, but don't fall for it. Adobe is phasing out GoLive. Shame on Adobe! If I had any choice, I'd dump Adobe in a second, but Dreamweaver is the only game in town for Macintosh. Adobe, because you've abandoned your GoLive users: you s_ck! Talk about greed.Summary: If you buy any GoLive version on any platform, you're throwing your money away. Don't make my mistake. I am out the cost of GoLive CS2 ($180) plus another $200 in GoLive CS2 how-to books. Am I bitter? You betcha."
3,Beware of pinched fingers,"My 16 mo old loves this shape sorter. However, when we first started playing with it, four months ago, she repeatedly pinched her fingers in the rotating body. Maybe it's not an issue for older kids, and they do recommend it for 12+ months. Just keep in mind it can be very painful for younger children."
1,Poor design catches and pinches little fingers,"It's cute, but the rotating barrel on this shape sorter doesn't really add anything to the toy. The blocks fall out of the elephant's trunk instantly (no need to rotate at all), and I threw it away after my 10-month old got her finger painfully stuck in it and had a small bruise. Toys that bite aren't fun! It was also much more difficult to keep track of the blocks because it's almost impossible to store all the blocks in the elephant at once; they fall out of the trunk too easily. We have enjoyed Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Blocks far more than this toy."
5,Great toy!,"I just bought this toy for my 9-month old. It is so neat. Wind the tail to turn the body, put the shapes in, then pull on the ears or push the trunk to empty the pieces out. My 9-month-old can not put the shapes in by herself yet, but she loves to turn the body of the elephant and dump the shapes out of his trunk. Very cute toy."
5,Great toy!,"My 9 month old loves this toy! She may not like trying to get the shapes in yet, but she loves to spin the sorter and turn the tail. She likes for me to put the shapes in and watch them spill out..."
3,"Okay toy, somewhat cheap","We received the Infantino Jumbo toy as a gift for our one-year-old. It's a cute design, but its cheap construction shows in the hard plastic body and the fact that the parts don't move very smoothly-- the rotating body especially has a tendency to get stuck. A minor peeve is that I wish they had used something other than a hexagon for one of the shapes. It's just an awkward word for a baby or toddler to try to learn; something like a heart would be much easier.Circo makes a very similar elephant toy though I can't tell who knocked off who since both brands are generic."
2,temperamental sorter,This sorter has shapes that are a precise fit making it more difficult to line up with their respective holes. The shapes have to be put in from the top of the drum because the internal parts are in the way when you try to put shapes through holes at the sides. When you push down on the trunk the shapes are supposed to empty out but they sometimes get stuck. A fun concept but frustrating for my 11 month old.
2,Not really worth the purchase,"This is not a fun toy for my 1 yr old grandson who is just getting into shapes has not played with this since the first day. He has other shape sorters that he does play with. I think if the shapes launcher worked, he might like it better."
4,Fine Haydn at a Great Price,"There's no getting around the fact that Jochum adds his own personal touches to all the works in this set, and as with his Bruckner, they work marvelously and make the listening a lot of fun. Haydn infuses his work with a great deal of humor and wit as it is; these performances simply enhance those qualities. They're not as rough & ready as Bernstein/NYP, not as refined as Colin Davis/COA; but they're well-played, inspired, and for the Haydn enthusiast, never dull.The ""bonus"" recordings on Disc #5 date from 1962 and 1958 (the remainder of the set from 1972-73) and sound absolutely great!"
3,Collectors Edition,Music is wonderful. In set I got Disk 3 was not as labeled. Contents were those for Disk 5 Result is Sym 97 missing from set.
5,Memory book,"I just bought this ""yearbook"" of memories for an anniversary gift for friends who were married in 1947. I think they make great gifts as they have highlights of events, movies, radio, political news, even covers the new products and inventions of that year. Also has the advertisements for cars, household items, etc. that were new then. A great ""lookback"" at how things were then."
1,BAAAAAD!,"bought the 42 in , first of all it wasnt the brand it said on the ad ! very dissapointed , didnt come with directions. And no return address ! don't buy it .. not worth it at all"
3,Strong hold,"This is a good product - just not right for my hair. It causes breakage, and my relaxed hair to be very dry and brittle."
3,Easily broken,"A few days after I received the case I bumped against something and the badge came off of the front of it. A few days later I sat down with it on and it hit the arm of the chair and the plastic clip broke off. It still does the job by using the belt straps and it is easy to take the I-Pod out and put it back, but I'd just say that it doesn't stand up well to rough treatment."
2,Only for the diehard,"Being a huge fan of late 60s thru modern pop, I have to say this album is a bit of a dog. I first heard You're All Forgiven on Poptopia and it knocked my socks off. I had it so loud I didn't hear an emergency vehicle behind me! Unfortunatly that is the only great track on the album. There are 1 or 2 other ""ok"" songs but this album falls flat. This band cannot be compared to Matt Sweet, Gigolo Aunts etc. Maybe i'm being harsh but I found the guitar licks almost amaturistic and the nasaly vocal wore thin real quick. If you have Poptopia, thats all you'll need to hear from this band. Bottom line is this, its a just ok cd that you'll listen to 3 times and it'll hit the shelf...."
4,"part narrative, part info on bipolar disorder","I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It reminded me of Patty Duke's ""A Brilliant Madness"" in that it was partly about the author's own struggle with bipolar disorder and partly about information on the disease. It was pretty well written, well organized, and easy to follow. As I like to gain information on this complex subject from a variety of sources, this book is a worthy addition to any small library of books on bipolar disorder. I also suggest books by Miklowitz, Torrey, and Jamison. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
1,An overly self-referential book without much research into the malady.,"It's stunning to see that this book has earned a 4.5-star rating from readers, given the fact that only the first paragraph under each header has anything to do with BPD generally: the rest is all about how the author had sex with her car's stick shift (!), smoked pot or whatever else is related, if only tangentially, to the subject at hand. This makes for a very tedious read, as it appears she has done little, if any, research beyond a mostly regurgitated recollection of what she learned in her therapy sessions.This is one embarrassingly creepy book. No, I didn't get past the third chapter--who wants to?There are better books out there."
4,Practical and Informative,"This is a thorough, but easy to understand book. The author gave good but not dramatic descriptions of episodes. I appreciate her positive writing that provides many ways to support someone with a mood disorder."
4,very helpful,"i found the book to be very helpful and understanding; it was easy to read, which is very helpful for someone with bipolar disorder."
3,Up and Down,"The book Wakefield is very hard for me to review. One second I would love one of main characters (Wakefield) many rambles but then the next I would be looking to skim the entire next rambling. The entire book really not having a plot would bug me one second and then make totally sense the next. Overall, the book was entertaining and actually learned a little but just be prepared to get annoyed a couple times with sections going way too long and not making a ton of sense."
1,I put it down,"Maybe Andrei Codrescu is liked by many people, undoubtedly he is because he has a number of books out.However, I only was able to read about half of this book and put it down. I am a person who hardly ever puts a book down, as I will garind my way through most of them, but this one went down.Don't know what others see in it, but as for me, forget it.Sorry about that.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,Beware of antenna aiming limitations,Hard to get activated. Spent over 2 hours trying to find where the antenna could be aimed. Reception fluctuates during the day. The radio itself is high quality with excellent sound.
5,Tivoli Model Satellite Table Radio/ Sirius Satellite Radio,I bought this as a gift and it is well worth the money: very nicely put together and a good looking product.
1,save your cash,"My first satellite radio, I didn't need to spend 12.95 a month for bad reception. I just spent the last 1/2 hour walking around with the antenna trying to get reception, no different than FM. The radio is OK, only comes in the light colored wood and has an ugly white cord that could only look good in someone's kitchen. I also bought the extra speaker and sub-woofer, if your still set on one mine will be by the curb."
3,Got the short end of the stick,I was disappointed at this Tivoli table top Satellite FM/AM radio I purchased recently. None of the 20 preset memories are available for any AM or FM band stations to be stored. It could have been a much better and more useful radio if Tivoli or whoever designed the radio for them would have chosen to avail some of the twenty presets reserved for the two other bands - not just the satellite band. Also a better contrast color paint markers and some treble/bass control mechanism and bigger than tiny buttons would have made the radio much more competitive on the market especially for those of us who are interesyted only for home use and who may not exactly have teen ager eye sight.Still looking for the ideal radio!Bergram
4,sounds as gorgeous as it looks,"great system, unbelievable sound quality. my only complaint is that it comes with a power pack that is the size of a brick."
4,Have Sattilite Radio at your bedside,"Great item , only Sirius clock radio I have seen. Beats having a Boom Box that the sirius module fits in. Clear for a radio with one speaker."
4,Xtreme Game Boy Color Action,"Fun is what this game is all about! There is a contest being held by a major soft drink company and you must defeat several people to win the contest! The action includes roller blading, surfing, skateboarding, sky surfing, and other sports. Their is a small RPG mode for the game, but that is just walking around gathering information and to challebge opponents. The sports action is a side-scrolling journey where you have to match or beat your opponents time, tricks, and collected flags. If you beat your opponent you will receive a medal and that person will sit down indicating that you have beaten them! The remaining challengers will remain standing. Xtreme sports is indeed xtreme!"
5,The Hottest Gameboy Game,"This game was totally awesome. It is not like any of those ""Beat-it-in-10 minutes"" kind of game. I like the challenge and the grahics. Winning the medels is hard, but fun to try to get. I am still about a quarter way through the game, and had it for a while. It may take long to beat, but is definetly worth the buy. It is full of great ideas, and I congratulate the makers for this great game. I would recommend this to everyone."
4,A Must for anyone who cares about health care!,"I finished this book in an evening; I couldn't put it down. The author has succinctly outlined our present healthcare system and how we got here. More importantly, she explains why it doesn't work and some ideas on how to design a system which will work. The book is written for the layperson, but as a healthcare professional, I found this book to be a real eye-opener."
3,Redundant,"I purchased this deck thinking it was going to be set up like a regular tarot deck with Feng Shui thematic images. The images on the cards are highly redundant and not as impressive as the image shown on the box. This makes it hard to use for the typical tarot readings. It doesn't work for my purposes, but might work for others."
4,Buy the Cards and the Book,"I own this tarot deck and the companion book. You really need both to understand the deck. The school of feng shui (wind-water) that this deck focuses on is the form school. You can't feng shui your home or garden with the cards. It simply uses symbols common in feng shui---like the 4 celestial animals. If you love Asian styled art, you'll love this deck. If you ever felt slightly uncomfortable owning a tarot deck that had creepy images of the death card and the devil card, you will truly enjoy this deck because it has artistically drawn images of ""transition"" and ""materialism."" The cards are well made and fun to shuffle. This would make a nice gift for people who enjoy and/or collect cards."
3,"Artistically beautiful, but...","There's no book, other than the tiny white one that provides no clue on nearly all hundreds of symbols employed on the cards. Since many of them aren't related to the feng shui but were adopted from Chinese mythology, we're left poorer on both counts. Gorgeous to look at, it's clear some publisher decided to go with the deck without paying the designers to do the book--and provide the clues to their very original work. Too bad."
1,Now Who's Treasonous?,"It's a little bit frightening, this United States that Ann Coulter portrays. Yet in her constant attacks on liberal Americans (without whom, by the way, the U.S. would be a dictatorship of one political viewpoint and party), Coulter never even comes close to criticizing conservatives. Nowhere in Ms. Coulter's catalogue does she criticize the political ""slip-ups"" of Ronald Reagan, the unabashed lying of the current administration, or the fact that this country has prospered immensely under 20th-century liberal leaders such as Harry S Truman and Theodore Roosevelt (yes, there was a time when Republicans were liberals, Ms. Coulter). This book is meant to be nothing but inflammatory in a much, much harsher sense than even Al Franken's latest or anything Michael Moore has ever done. If readers like inflammatory books, this is the one for you; if you're like me, however, looking for something fair and balanced, this is certainly not the way to go."
5,"Compelling, well written, and factual!","Ann Coulter has lived up to her reputation once again for being intelligent, factual, and with great ability to communicate difficult material in a very no-nonsense manner! She has backed up her conclusions with hard evidence that will make the left wing cringe once again! Her flair for writing and backing it up so well with hard evidence and research makes it both a great read, and an enlightening text that is instructive in many areas.If you care about America, you should read this book!"
1,Substance should be Apparent from the Cover,"By publishing a full body shot of Ms. Coulter on the cover, the publishers have made it clear that they intend to benefit from her sex appeal rather than her intellectual capabilities. After reading the book, I have to agree with their strategy. Anyone that considers 'Treason' a serious political read must pay a visit to their nearest mental institution."
1,Coulter is either insane or a con artist,"The 'facts' in her book have already been rebutted by numerousarticles and interviews. Her exposure rate is coming down. Youdon't see her as often on TV anymore. I suppose she is socarried away by her fantasy that she is losing her very littlecredibility left.Or she could be a calculating con artists, saying all the thingspeople on the right like to hear, to make a buck, to create a sensation. Well, this time, she miscalcalated and went too far.Sad!"
5,Hey Liberal reviewers...refute with DOCUMENTATION! :),"Coulter's TREASON is absolutely fabulous. It's about time someone told the truth about Hiss, the Rosenbergs, and the dozens of other TRAITORS that Venona PROVED were guilty as sin. To echo an earlier reviewer: Liberals, if you're going to argue with the grown-ups, insults aren't going to be good enough--documentational refutation and logic, please. Grow up."
5,"Aah, Ann Coulter","Thank God for someone like Ann Coulter who exposes lying liberal apologists like Al Franken and all the leftist politicians and activists who have betrayed the United States over the years. I admire Ann's thorough research, intelligence, forthrightness and wit. She utterly annihilates the leftwing propaganda that is passed off as truth and ""news"" and sucked up by some of the nitwits that posted comments here. As liberals do, they attempt to malign Ann's character because they are stumped by the facts."
5,Best political book I've read in years! Well worth the cost,"Great read! I'll never hear that tired old ""McCarthyism"" accusation again - without laughing in the accuser's face and telling them about this book!"
2,"""Manchurian Candidate"" Redux","Surprise! Ann Coulter is making great efforts to bring down the right wing in this country - just as the Angela Lansbury character was planning in the film version of ""The Manchurian Candidate.""Lansbury's 50's character was a Soviet communist agent in the guise of a U.S. right wing zealot, working to create a mainstream backlash that would eventually destroy the right (and the country) - and she's Coulter's model!Coulter is smarter than 90% of her audience - they don't get it. For the great unwashed, her diatribes are grist for the mill; for a few others, it's great satire.But some people are on to her, and now understand her doublethink paradigm. She's become too obvious! Only a dyed-in-the-wool subversive would so slavishly defend Joe McCarthy in this day and age.With ""Treason"", I think her effectiveness as an enemy agent has reached the point of diminishing returns.Her true color is showing -- and it's red as a rose."
1,A Gift Gone Wrong,"Well, at least I can appreciate what everyone is talking about, Ann Coulter is ubiquitous (Kobe, Scott, and Ann 24/7), but I received this book as a gift, and as a joke- which it is.You can't slight Ann, though, she is laughing all the way to the bank! (I heard tell she is a millionaire) and, I rarely miss a chance to hear her views when she appears on TV. (I wonder if Hannity gets a cut on her books.) She must have the best agent, ever."
1,Ann Coulter is Boring Me,"I used to be a Conservative, until people like Coulter hi-jacked the ideals of my Party. Now, all she whines about is how Liberals this and Democrats that, in the most vitriolic, offensive, in-your-face sentences she can manage.I've just about had enough, I want my party back from the Coulters and Limbaughs and O'Reillys and Hannitys, who have made Conservatism mean a mad dog's Hate for every other way of thinking. The book offers precious little insight, scholarship, supported claims, or new ideas.It's just a dumb rehash of recent history, with a good measure of vicious bombast to excite the basest instincts in her audience. And the claim that McCarthy was right borders on the criminally stupid!This book is a waste of money, unless you love to get angry and have a real need to feel betrayed and victimized."
1,Stop her before she writes another book...,"Between 'Treason,' 'High Crimes and Misdemeanors' and 'Slander,' we have completed the unholy trilogy of badly written books penned for the middle-aged, conservative white racist male. In the years to come, this trilogy might become as popular as the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Might, but I doubt it, hopefully the people buying this right wing garbage will have more brains by then."
1,No,Far right wingers will love this book and make them feel better. However the book really is just a bunch of name calling instead of focusing on the issues.
1,Scholars dispute her work,".Thinking Conservatives would do well to distance themselves from this woman. A number of conservative writers have come out speaking very negatively about her latest book.Here are a few tidbits that Andrew Sullivan (a well known conservative columnist) wrote about Ann:...One of the most reputable scholars who has studied the McCarthy era in great detail, Ron Radosh, is appalled at the damage Coulter has done to the work he and many others have painstakingly done over the years. ""I am furious and upset about her book,"" he told me last week. ""I am reading it - she uses my stuff, Harvey Klehr and John Haynes, Allen Weinstein etc. to distort what we actually say and to make ludicrous and historically incorrect arguments....."
1,Her 15 minutes are almost up,Swill. Anyone with any knowlege of Mccarthy knows he made up just about everything. Its like saying the concentration camps never existed. Ever seen this women on TV? She's jsut creepy. Ugh. You have to be seriously deluded or nuts to swallow this B.S.
1,It's unwise tossing the word 'treason' around so lightly.,"A lot of liberals--patriots--died for this country fighting right-wing extremists in WWII.Coulter may be a satirist. She may be a moron. Either way, 'treason' is not a term to be used so lightly.I doubt the integrity of those who peddle this kind of inflammatory crap."
1,Ann Coulter: Because Thinking for Yourself is Too Damn Hard,"If you're incapable of rational, analytical thought and are dying for simplistic, idiotic answers to complicated political issues then buy this book. It's just what you need."
1,Sick,"This is revisionist history, sham. a joke. We wonder what is wrong with america, it is coulter with her jabs and hate attitude. It is OK to disagree, It is not right to slander, and put down. Political disagreement can be expressed, but if one hates another, they really hate themselves. I want a balanced account when I pay money, with scholarship and integrity. Not junk on a page."
1,Don't go here looking for intelligent conservative thought,"Anyone who raises Joe McCarthy to the status of a patron saint really shouldn't be taken seriously by anyone who has half a brain. The respected conservative publication National Review dropped her column for good reason -- sloppy research and writing. The fact that her ranting comes in a package that's young, thin and blonde (nice black, slinky outfit on the cover, Ann -- adds a lot to your journalistic credibility)is the only reason this woman is getting any media coverage - if she weighed 200 pounds, nobody would care.I'm sure she's angling for a show on the Fox News Channel, but like Rush, Ms. Coulter is just the latest right-wing flavor of the month who's bound to fade away, leaving behind a minor cult following at best. Let's hope that happens none too soon."
1,Again?,"All of her books are exactly the same, she should have written just one book on how she thinks liberals are wrong then she should've been done with it. Someone should tell her that there are other things to write about."
2,"Slept through American History class, did you Ann?","I was rather flummoxed by this book. I read the chapter on Joe McCarthy first, and started laughing. What an amazing lack of understanding this woman has! Is she projecting or what? In the words of a political talk show host addressing Ann, ""You just make s___ up!"" Yes, I'd say she does.I gave the book two stars simply for making me laugh so hard."
1,If you think Ann Coulter has an honest bone in her body...,"... try reading Al Franken's ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right."" Franken thoroughly examines the journalistic ""integrity"" of the 41 (or is it 39???) year old Ms. Coulter and finds it thoroughly wanting."
1,sludge and simplicity,"hey - here's a great idea for a book - i'll pose on the cover to draw people's attention, then suck them in with oversimplifications, making it sound like people who express their opinions are un-American. great if you like your opinions overgeneralized. worthless for any further thought or conversation."
5,An eye-opener,"Ann put together much information that has been buried or distorted. I've come across much of this same info in my history research but of course the media doesn't make a big deal out of it. What are they going to do, admit that not only were they wrong but that they were serial liars for over 40 years?If you only read one conservative book this year make it this one."
4,Fascinating book,"Treason is a fascinating read. Her chapters on McCarthy, and Alger Hiss are fascinating. I found the chapter on Hiss particularly striking - it agreed perfectly with what my parents (who lived through the time) told me about the case.""Treason"" is more like ""High Crimes and Misdemeanors"" than ""Slander"" - less entertaining and more serious."
1,Hyperbole will get you nowhere,"I am neither liberal or conversative, but the mere title of this book which equates an entire branch of political philosophy (a branch that does not agree with itself) with treason is not only unconversative, but a Maoist style tactic of propaganda.The claims are mostly hyperbole and any decent conservative thinker would be appalled at the blanket condemnation. It is a Radical Right thing to do, but may I remind you that Radical Right and Conversative are not the same thing. A conversative is not a reactionary, a conversative does not sling hyperbole.Even conversatives that use hyperbole well . . . such as Florence King, Arthur Herman, Norman Podhoretz, and P. J. O'Rourke as well as conversative thinkers like Walker Percy would be appalled. Indeed, Miss Coulter seems to make more of a carear out of bashing liberals than actually defining a point. Its not a point that is going to make a neo-conversative viewpoint more appealing."
1,What a mess,"Coulter's book will only convince those who are already convinced of her venomous thesis and will repel anyone who thinks for themselves. I'm about a third of the way through and am anxious to see if she can keep up the average of a lie, a distortion, or a fabrication on every single page. Utter garbage intended only for the paranoid and deluded."
1,un-patriotic,"Ann Coulter is about as un-patriotic as you can get. She twists well documented facts to suit her own agenda. Anybody who has lived through the Mcarathy era knows very well what a scary and horrible man he was. But she makes him out to be a saint. This book is 90% fiction and should not be taken as fact. People, please do some research and you will discover how twisted and one-sided this person really is. She is trying to create a one party system and anyone who is not a republican in her opinion is worthless. She truely is one of the most un-patriotic,treasonous people in this country."
1,Coulter needs to read before she writes,"Coulter defends her bleak position with the typical monotiny that we here from fundamentalists on a daily basis. Her point is to stir up tensions between the left and the right- how much hate do we need? Don't read this book. Read something intelligently written based on facts. Instead of pitting the two sides against each other (they've both made mistakes) lets try to figure out a way to make this country a place where everyone has food, a roof over their head, education and health care. Ann Coulter, please read a book before you write one."
1,A legend in her own mind.,"Deaf, dumb, and blind: the ego has her bewitched!!!! The worst history lesson I've ever received. Does she realize the irony behind her liberal vs. conservative rants?Today, the liberals are on the forefront in ""conserving"": advocating for enviromental conservation; conserving the integrity of the bill of rights; conserving the dynamics of our check and balances to ensure us an equal distrubtion of power. Meanwhile, her good ol' boys are reeking havoc. These ""conservatives"" are doing the complete opposite of ""conserving"": stripping nature of its limited resources , encroaching upon our traditional constitutional rights, etc.....this book holds no weight. If you're looking for historical insight please read Zinn's A People's History of The United States."
5,Encourage conservatives to read.,"Everybody knows that Ann Coulter is a Neocon propagandist who is completely full of herself. However, I think that any book which encourages uneducated people to read is a good idea."
2,Ann is smarter than all the stupid idiots,I like the book because it shows that the librals should be put in a jail for trying to kill every one and they are going to ruin our country. If the librals are so smart they should go to cuba and russia. They are STUPID!!!!! They are the reason that many people are dead because they hate americans. I like Ann because she isn't scared that the liberals (idiots) are trying to ruin her career. She has many fans that think she is good. I like her book. I hope all the librals get killed so president BUSH can save america from the arabs. I hope president BUSH (hero) saves america. He should hire Ann and let her work at the white house beacuse the librals are trying to ruin her career. ATTENTION PRESIDENT BUSH!!!!!!!! give her a job at the white house telling librals to get out of america!!!!!!!! She was on TV and she told the librals to go to hell. I vote for TWO STARS!!!! GO GET THEM ANN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Coulter Says It Best,"""Expand the electorate to include your political allies. That's why Republicans wanted to enfranchise blacks, prohibitionists wanted to enfranchise women, and Democrats want to enfranchise felons."" A FL court did that for felons in 7/03."
1,Ann Coulter is a whiner and she hates America.,"Who is Ann Coulter?She is an avowed follower of Jesus, yet she preaches social Darwinism. She abhors the sexualization of our society, yet she wears miniskirts that would make Jenna Jameson blush. She speaks for the common man, yet she comes from an elite background. She preaches family values, yet has never married nor had children. She calls liberals ""totalitarian,"" yet she endorses a theocratic, one-party state and is an admirer of Joe McCarthy. She cries out for a more civil political discourse, yet is the most unhinged, extremist, shrill hatchet man of her ideological circle.That's Ann Coulter, folks--the darling of the fascist Republican Party."
1,Zzzzzzz,"Slightly entertaining, in a silly way, in small increments. Otherwise it's a cure for insomnia."
1,typical american,"Although most of the scientific achievements have relied and still rely on imigrants' contributions, for me as a foreigner, she is typical right-wing arogant American, who thinks everything ""good"" is found and develped in the US by ""true Americans."""
1,Treason?,It is very hard to believe anything Miss Coulter writes. She sees everything through her right wing radical eyes.
1,Jingoistic Loon,"Ann Coulter is nothing more than a self-loathing caricature of her own self. She hates liberals because she deep down inside really hates herself. If it werent for those evil liberals who fought for equal rights for women, she wouldnt have been able to spew all this self-loathing clap-trap she writes in her books. To put it quite simply, Ann Coulter wishes she would have been born a chauvinist man. Some might suggest that she really is. Just look at the Adams Apple!"
1,More Proof that My Own Party Has Gone Insane,"This book is a mish-mash of half-baked ideas, poorly referenced facts, and (yes folks it's true!) is badly written (who taught this girl English?).Do all Republicans accept at face value anything that a ""conservative"" purports to be fact. In her last book it was proven repeatedly that her ""references"" and ""facts"" were misquoted or (in some cases) plain made up (don't blame the liberal media, even the conservative magazines discussed this). To accept anything this person says without question is scary. Do you get a free brown shirt with the purchase of this book (I didn't, but it will most likely come in the mail any day)?As a registered Republican, I can only hope that our party moves away from the demagoguery of the Rush Limbaugh's and the Ann Coulter's and instead focus' on what's best for our country and not what's best for Ann and Rush's pocketbook."
1,What a bimbo,"Not only is the book badly written, it's logic is nonexistent. The author's rhetoric is academic, her facts are barely veiled opinions, and her writing style is childish. Anyone with a grade school intelligence can see this book is nothing but whining.Good thing she put herself on the cover. She certainly can't sell the books on its merits. Way to flaunt the blond hair and curves, lady -- that's the only way you're going to get readers."
1,Why such a fuss about a poorly written book?,"I frankly expected this book to be the usual morass of poorly written, abominably researched facts and a blatant grasp for notoriety at all costs. I was not disappointed. Ann Coulter apparently must believe she is superior to all human beings with any intelligence for she written such a vitriolic book full of half truths that words fail to express my outrage such a book is a best seller. But then, Coulter is paid to write and say anything. My advice: if you have the book...."
1,lies and nonsense,terrible waste of money and time. no sane person would read this book unless curious about mental illness
1,Is she serious?,Here's what you do. See if you can read even the first paragraph without laughing out loud and shaking your head at the stupidity.
1,Ann Coulter is a nutcase,"i have no problem with conservatives who tell the truth. i just have a problem with coservatives who LIE.if this book 'opens your eyes' try reading something that shows the liberals point of view before making up your mind. (that would be Lies, and the lying liars who tell them, by al franken). Because Ann Coulter is a liar.Even the republicans i know call her insane.She doesn't talk about the good things FDR did, or the good things that Clinton did (whoa! where'd the national debt go? oh wait... another bush. We're being plunged into debt again!)Even Al Franken will acknowledge a few good things that conservatives did. Just not the insane ones. (ie, ann coulter)"
5,Truth always comes out,"Without the media spin, the last fifty years were far more interesting and dangerous than we ever imagined. Thoroughly documented - impossible to seriously deny."
1,Dissent NOT treason - this is still America!,"I don't know who is scarier....Coulter or her fans (like ""mormondad2"") who consider anyone refusing to parrot right-wing dogma ""traitors.""Hello? This is America. The last time I checked, dissent was not a synonym for treason.I also love the people who can't even spell ""hypocrisy' correctly but use it to label everyone who dares to disagrees with them! (These are the same people who need to check with Rush or Hannity before they can go to the bathroom.)Interesting that Coulter's ""sales"" are BULK buys. What is she smoking anyway?"
1,McCarthyism,"Filled with fabrications and baseless accusations, Coulter blurs the line between her political enemies and the nation's enemies in a Stalin-esque manifesto.Sincerely,Jacques Paisner"
1,An outburst of explosive flatulence from beginning to end!,"Recipe for conservative thought, followed by Raggedy Ann-Let stew in own juices for 15 years until extremely bitter. Serves only itself. WARNING: Nuttier than a fruitcake, and nearly impossible to swallow!"
4,Needs more pictures!,"One day you all should try looking through the reviews for the many conservative or Republican books on Amazon. It would seem that people who share the same outlook of said books give it a fair shake; while the rest seem to be of the 1 star ""teh Conservatives are teh NAZIS"" type.Tail-Gunner Joe: I used to be really dead set against him, and am still, but reading Treason has shown me another side of him that I was unaware of existed, and gives much food for thought about how our history is written, and by who it is written. I'm glad there are those like Ann Coulter who aren't afraid to take on the liberal establishment--and she does it with facts, something many liberal authors tend to forget exist.I highly recommend this one, but, I must say--Ann is hot! There really should be more pictures of her in future books."
1,This book is an affront the genre of a novel,"Coulter does not have any credible sources. Her premise is so far right of the accepted right wing philosophy it is absolutely SCARY. Mein Kampf is something that comes to mind, when I read this 'book'. Her ideology borderlines on fascism, being a centrist I cannot possibly believe that all liberals hate America and are working in blissful collusion to undermine her. That ridiculous and absulutely slanderous. COULTER is a shock jock of the genre, and only serves up ad-hoc talking points for her demographic. Not worth the money or time to read."
2,"Well-written, but hollow and immature","Just finished the book...and it wasn't easy to finish. While, the book is well-written and easy to read...it's content is so far to the right of the political spectrum that I imagine 90% of Americans would never enjoy the read. Much of the book is very immature, with personal attacks and the like much more prevalent than cold-hard facts or logical conclusions. Unfortunately, I don't think the book is worth the money I paid for it. I would not recommend it to friends, unless they were extremely right-wing."
1,Lack of a backbone,"As with most extremists, Ann has regretfully ignored the common people and will not supply anyone with her email address. In an online poll of political websites, the only email addresses published were those of the leftist authors who welcome and encourage discussion and debate.The book was horrible, her information on McCarthy ignorant of facts. Ann's research for this book was her life while she was in puberty, clearly clouding her view of the world.Ms. Coulter, what man beat you? Who caused this massive amount of hate and vituperance? How can you continue to slander everyone with a different view?I am genuinly curious how Ms. Coulter feels about Senator John McCain and his centrist views while calling himself a Republican, but unfortunately I can't ask her"
5,Heady Stuff,"Ann Coulter is not an authur for those who enjoy a light read. She has taken a topic that stirs contoversy and causes some to attack her without basis in facts. Ann has taken the time to document what she writes. When you read this book, take the time to check out the documentation and see if what she writes rings true. Many reviews written here are based in political bias (including this one), however, read with an open mind to the documentation and you will have to agree that Joe was demonized to some extent. The book will make you rethink the potential dangers that exist in American politics."
1,Any thinking American Should and will be Insulted,"Just suffered through this piece of fiction. Incredible obfuscation. Could Ann be any more evasive? From what I recall of history, Ann's account is full of half-truths, convenient selective memory, and historical revisionism. Any thinking American should and will be insulted.Her facial expression on the cover says it all. Ann has grandiose goals for the future. Read her book and see if this elitist/ actress/ anti-semite (do the research) will lead America down the path to secular wasteland. I thought she was smart too, but then I read the book."
1,"Oh, please...","I didn't have to buy the book. I picked it out of the garbage. The 1st Amendment gives her the right to sell this stuff, but let's hope that Americans who bought the book don't ""buy"" the lies and distortions in this book. I don't know how anyone with a conscience can stand behind such drivel."
1,Save us all...,"from radical extremists of any stripe. This book demonstrates how one of that ilk will cynically bend, distort, and even lie to promote her agenda. Coulter is on the brink of joining history's select club of all-time-greatest crackpots with this one. Unfortunately, there are many who won't exercise their powers of critical thinking and will swallow it hook, line, and sinker. Our country's spirit is sullied whenever it encourages demagogues like this one."
1,Garbage,Why does anyone take this ignorant witch seriously as an intellectual? I'm definitely NOT a conservative but there are at least a few conservatives whose intellect I somewhat respect...but this woman is definitely not one of them. I can't believe how often she shows up on some TV show panel plugging this awful book. Can't they find anyone more intelligent?
1,Unfortunately I decided to try this one out,"I found this book on several listmanias, and was convinced that it was going to be a real eye opening read. Of course, once I checked out the books page I found out that it hasn't even been released yet - so I anxiously waited to find out what the liberals are doing. Coulter has lost her mind with this piece of work, where it seems that she is using the lever of the fear of terrorism to point fingers every which way except to her extreme religious values. Well, it's like they say, ""if you have an average IQ then about 50% of the people are dumber than you."" This book was written for the said 50%"
1,Save Your Money,"Just when I think Ann Coulter cannot possibly get anymore ridiculous...she does. In this book, she champions Joe McCarthy. There are too many good books out there to waste your money on this poorly-written rant by a woman whose books are based on few facts and even fewer reliable sources."
1,unfounded garbage,Don't be fooled. Ann Coultier is on intellectual par with Howard Stern. This book is is a pile of unfounded garbage by an irrationally conservative shock jock.
1,Watch out! There be witches about...,"...Once again, by innuendo, quotes out of context, misquotes, and outright distortions, Coutler proves that she is a disgrace to this country. Perhaps the very fact that she attempts to defend Joseph McCarthy's antics in this book is the most perverse of her rants. Perhaps she would like to start up the Salem witch trails again and burn all liberals at the stake.It's ashame this drivel passes for intelligent commentary in today's world. How sad!But, I would say this, if anyone has become traitors to the American Dream, it's the right wing (though I may be kidding for the most part).Really, it's about time each side stop hurling epithets at each other, and start having a serious open dialog about their differences, or this country is going to go down the tube (Unfortunately, Coutler would label me a traitor merely for staying that last sentence)."
1,Read this instead,"If you want a true look at McCarthyism and Red Baiting along with the havoc it caused read Scoundrel Time by Lillian Hellman. She lived through it and survived. It is shocking that anyone could possibly make Cohn, Nixon, and McCarthy heroes. Once again read Scoundrel Time not this drek!"
1,Pure and simple bigotry and violence monger,"Ms. Coulter actually stated in the National Review Online of September 13, 2002, in reference to Middle Eastern countries, ""We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious (during WW II) about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war.Folks, please take a stand against bigotry, religious hatred and violence. Buying Coulter's book will only support these. What she advocates is not the American Way. Just because someone attacked our soil in 2001 does not mean that we must become worse than the terrorists who did that to us."
1,Ann Coulter Needs Medication...No Kidding,"After reading this book I'm more sure than ever that Ann Coulter needs some serious psychiatric help. Zyprexa might be good to help deal with her hallucinations/psychotic meanderings and paranoia. Maybe a good SSRI like celexa or paxil to help even out her neurotic obsession with seeing the world as so ""black and white"", refusing to acknowledge the inevitability of ""grey areas"" that the rest of us deal with on a daily basis. Please don't put money in this woman's hands by buying this book. If you must, send her information on medications that could help her live her life more fully and with alot more grace."
1,The Right's Willing Servant,"Ann Coulter proves the fact of the myth of the liberal media. There is no liberal media. The right-wing pundits have actually found an interested audience in the lower poor classes who like mud-slinging Jerry Springer antics as well as the rich elite, who ultimately benefit from the right's tactics.Ann Coulter is no genius, no shrewd social or political critic, and definitely not aware of what truly goes on in this complex world. The neo-cons and their leashed dogs of the major media have found a willing and energetic attack dog who will spew their dogma to all who will listen.Let's be honest, she gets paid to get down on her knees and do her master's bidding.Read this book if you will, but if you want true political and social analysis, read Chomsky or Zinn."
1,"Talentless, Witch-hunting Hackwork","This book, as all her works, is nothing more than talentless, witch-hunting hackwork; it is the worst kind of populist tripe-and shows itself as exactly what it is-intolerance at its most egregious-which wraps itself in the banner of patriotism and concerned conservatives, while she rakes in the cake with both hands as the cash register sings to the tune of ""God Bless America."" What a laugh!"
1,Pure Unadultrated Garbage,The first 20 pages was all I could handle. Ann Coulter would be an idealogical fit for the Taliban Mullahs... but alas she is a woman so they might not have allowed her to write this book.
1,So sad...,"I have not read this book, nor will I because it is so disheartening to read of an American who views any other opinion that disagrees with hers as un-American and threatening. I find it ironic and hypocritical that a woman like Ann Coulter cannot recognized that she is being used by the Republicans to appeal to a sector they never want heard or consider in the first place. So sad..."
1,"At long last, have you no shame, ma'am?","Who is the audience for this book, anyway? Talk about preaching to an unholy choir!I saw Lou Dobbs attempt to interview her last night about this book, and she dismissed any point Lou tried to address with her favorite activity, ""liberal"" bashing. Only, who she considers a liberal is anyone who disagrees with her and her cabal.A shrill and illogical commentator who doesn't deserve serious attention."
5,What did you liberals expect?,"This book was fantastic. I thought it would be hard to beat Slander but she did. I'm glad I bought it on the first day I could. It pains me to see the negative reviews on here from liberals whom I am probably correct in assuming did not even read the book before they posted their 1 star review. Shame on you! You just hear Ann Coulter and then throw out your leftwing rhetoric. And if you're a liberal and did read the book...what did you expect? It's Ann Coulter, she ain't exactly making damn cornflakes here."
1,Sad,"If you hate communists, read this book. It will convince you that you are right, make you think you are therefore a good person and so on.However, if you're more interested in truth, honesty, would like to learn something about American history, read something else."
1,Poor indeed,"I don't consider myself either Republican or Democrat, and have voted for candidates from both parties. I have nothing good to say about this woman except Ugh! While there are a few interesting points in her book, most of it is hysteria, hatred and pure venom. I've seen her spit out her venom on TV and she's not a pleasant sight at all. She never answers challenges to what she spouts with any intelligence or directness. She evades probing questions or anything factual that clearly contradicts what she says. Instead she resorts to smarmy, witless sarcasm in that dour fashion of hers or gets hysterical. Her fundamentalism and extremism is as scary if not more scary than anything she criticizes. She's as emptyheaded as they come. Shame you can't give a book zero stars, because this one deserves it."
2,Reminded me of Mein Kamf,"It was funny and easy to read. Sounded an awful like a really mad, long ""letter to the editor"" that come out in local papers in the editorial section. All she tries to do in sell books, nothing more. She is a joke to any true conservastive who is not married to their cousin."
1,Good Feed For Sheep,I just shredded it and gave it the sheep as feed. That's the purpose of it anyways.
1,A Shameful Resurgence of McCarthyism,"Why does Ann insist on elevating the most vile, disgusting, hate-mongering period of American history since the Salem Witch Trials? Joe McCarthy as an American hero?Amazingly enough, Ann Coulter has hit a new low."
1,Appalling,"And to think scarce trees went to the blade for this. Truly reprehensible and a sign our country is in sad, sad shape."
1,Something is wrong with this woman,"In this piece of junk, Annie-girl says that Democrats are against a discussion of whether they are ""patriotic"" or not. Well, after reading this horror, can we the discuss the mental stability of Annie-girl. She is truly off her rocker. Oh yeah, how did Ambrose Bierce describe patriotism ""the last refuge of a scoundrel"" - a perfect definition of Annie-girl."
1,"The worst book I have ever read, ever","Being a proud Communist, gay-loving, tree-hugging, baby-killing traitor liberal I was naturally outraged at Coulter's ridiculous claims. But when I read her quote about the U.S Army I was pushed over the line. From my point of view, that is the most disgusting form of high treason. To attack the people that put their lives on the line to protect our freedom, to protect HER freedom. In her quest to expose the traitors, Coulter has become one herself. Coulter is the most vile, disgusting excuse for a human being ever to plague our great nation."
1,Conservative Propaganda,"Read this book with a reasonable and analytical frame of mind, as Coulter's mindset is incredibly biased."
1,Coulter makes insane people feel normal,"Annie's done it again. In this book, she labels anyone who doesn't agree with her ""A TRAITOR"" and then, when grilled about it on ""Hardball"" or ""Crossfire,"" refuses to admit she implied that in her book.Coulter's work appeals primarily to bigoted, intolerant right-wingers and their darkest, most twisted thoughts about exterminating the left, the middle, liberals and non-Christians. Many people write, ""Coulter says what all of us think, but haven't had the guts to say!""There's a reason for that. Sane people recognize when they are having temporarily destructive thoughts about ridding the planet of ""bothersome"" people, and they mentally correct themselves. Coulter and the audience to which her insane rantings appeal lack that ability.Coulter's frothing rant gives voice to the most twisted minds in the country, and makes them feel like normal folk."
1,"Didn't read it, but that title ...","As a Vietnam vet who served his country for 4 years and his community (as a volunteer for a public agency aiding the mentally disabled) for years afterword, I am sick unto death of being called a ""treasonous liberal"" for being in favor of a balanced budget, preservation of natural resources, reluctance to go to war, expanded health care, to name a few of my ""left wing"" ideals.From Webster's Unabridged:Liberal: One who advocates greater freedom of thought or actionConservative: Tending to preserve old institutions, methods, customs, and the like.The terms are not opposites! They are not about socialism, capitalism, ""left"" or ""right"", pro- or anti- anything. If we are to take a book seriously, the debate has to contain words of meaning.""The basic tool for the manipulation of reality is themanipulation of words. If you can control the meaning of words,you can control the people who must use the words.""(Philip K. Dick)"
1,Tell me to my face I hate America.,"Ms Coulter,I'm a liberal. Not extreme but I do vote Democrat and I'm sure I always will.I'm 6'6"" and I weigh 293 lbs. I'd love to meet you sometime so you can tell me to my face I hate America."
1,Treason indeed,"Coulter says contrary to what the liberal media claims, Iraq is doing very well thank you. Tell that to the American soldiers coming home with an arm, an eye, or a leg missing, or to the family of those soldiers who come home in a bodybag. These are the ones who want their country to know what extraordinary sacrifice they are making, and to them it must appear that Coulter is the one committing treason."
1,She can't even get her lies straight,"Well, when you call George Washington and Abe Lincoln traitors you have pretty much blown your credibility with me. Filled with silly fluff and poorly written to boot. The books fairly drips with paranoia. Certainly puts Ann firmly in the wack pack."
1,This joke is no joke,"As a conservative this book prompts me more than anything I have read in recent history to urge fellow conservatives to respond to outrageous garbage like this in a far more critical way. All you have to do is read the reviews submitted by those who are critical to see how easy it is to take shots at conservatives when writing like this is characterized as a representation of our view. We as conservatives will never have any credible or lasting influence on political direction and discourse if we rally behind charlatans who use absurd devices such as this book to grind out their personal bitterness and attempt to sell it as scholarship. It's conservatives who should be outraged by this travesty, not liberals. For liberals this book is a Christmas present. For conservatives it's now to time to once again defend ourselves as we always have to do when some irresponsible huckster gives the erroneous impression that we are all stupid."
1,It must be painful being Ann Coulter.,"In the alternate universe where Ann resides, all liberals (read Democrats) are treasonous evildoers, all conservatives (read Republicans) are virtuous patriots, and that's really all one needs to know to understand the workings of the world. When it comes to selecting the facts that support a silly thesis, and ignoring the ones that refute it, Ann is a master. I've not seen a definitive analysis of Ann's psychopathology, but have heard it has to do with some ""unusual"" spiritual views. At any rate, if you're a self-righteous American, this book should help you feel better about the voices in your head. Normal people will probably dismiss it as more pandering to brain-dead goofballs. That being said, at least Ann is capable of stringing together some grammatically correct sentences. Highly recommended for those interested in other's [quirks]."
5,A Must Read for All Who Love America,"A masterful work! Ann did her homework and presents an overwhelming case exposing the Left and the Democratic Party for its treachory and treason over the past half century. Her witty style, reasoned logic, and well researched facts made reading this book thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening. It will make you laugh and it will make you mad as hell. This is a must read for any serious minded American who cares for his or her country."
1,A book for America haters by an America hater.,"Ms. Coulter, Americans are currently being killed almost everyday in Iraq fighting to establish an Iraqi state in which its citizens will have the right to openly oppose their government and debate policy expressing views that may differ from the governing party of the day. If you don't value the ability of citizens to do so here in this country, then YOU, Ms. Coulter, are committing treason and expressing hatred for America."
1,Attention Freepers: You Have No Chance with Her,"Upcoming books being scribbled by the bulimic bombshell:1) If I Looked Like Lucianne Goldberg, I'd Sell Nothing2) Will You Freepers Please Stop Abusing the Dust Jacket3) Throwing Up For Beginners4) When 41 Equals 395) Joe McCarthy,Charlie McCarthy and Their Similar IQ's6) Sirhan, Oswald and Ray: American Heroes7) Smoking, Drinking and Dating Muslims: My Story8) How to Make a Living as a Lawyer and Never Enter a Courtroom9) What To Do About a Secret Love Named Bill"
1,Watch Fox News Instead,I can't understand why people like Coulter are even on the TV and writing books. Don't waste your money.
2,Revisionist in overdrive,What's next Ann...Nixon's inevitable resurrection by the right?Giving it an extra star for the entertainment value.
1,A Joke,"How can anyone take Coulter seriously? Venomous and lacking any relationship to reality, in a world of her own."
1,blather from an empty-headed liar,"A waste of your time, money, and energy needed to pick the book up. The only reason to complete the book is to study Coulter's lies before debating her on a talking head show."
1,Treason?,"I saw the word TREASON on the cover and thought the book was about Grover Norquest, Ken Lay, The Carlyle Group and Halliburton Corp, amoung others. There's fertile ground for my reasoning. Too bad Coulter is so out of touch...she could write a real book about treason and could interview all her friends for material!"
1,lacking in facts,"This book lacks in facts, and just makes up stuff as it goes along. Just like what one would expect is such a book anyway."
1,Mein Kampf????,Reminded me of Adolphs book. To much hate is not a good thing darlin. Why do you have so much anger? This book was not entertaining to me and I put it down after a few chapters. If your into anger and blameing everything on Democrats than read it. Most of us in this country are moderates. Neither to far to the right or left. I find the war between the far left and far right to be troublesome.
1,Disgusting -- filled with incorrect facts and vitriol,"Coulter screams loudly, yet says nothing. She evidently hopes that her hyperbolic, vitriolic spewings are vivid enough to cover her poor grasp of history. Her lionization of Joseph McCarthy as a ""poet"" is particularly obscene, as is her revisionist attitude toward history. This is garbage, and those who buy into her rantings are in serious trouble."
1,Typical conservative bashing,This book is just proof of how low conservative journalism has gone. To use the word intelectual and Ann Coulter is an insult to all real intelectuals. Conservative insanity at it's finest...
1,no facts,Talk about slander! Ann Coulter's most recent diatribe isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Every page carries at least a half dozen distortions or flat-out lies. She does not even attempt to back up her unbelievable claims.
1,ummmmm,"I do not agree with anything she says or writes, but she is so hot, and by hot I mean not only physically attractive but very intelligent as well. I love you Ann."
1,"Coulter is an hateful, ignorant person","Someone please tell ""Twiggy with Tourette's"" (as I've heard one comedian call her) that dissent and free speech do not constitute treason.Small wonder that Hillary Clinton is out-selling Anne-thrax by about 5-1. Senator Clinton's book is fact, while Coulter's tome is completely fiction!We have ""Treason"" in our local library and I was told that no one would touch it. Maybe they're afraid of Coulter's ignorance and hatefulness rubbing off on them."
1,Further Evidence of the Narrowing of the American Mind,"This book is NOT a well-reasoned, substantiated argument against Liberal politics. It is a Rorschach Test for Conservatives seeking validation of their current bent toward political and social hegemony. Given the substandard quality of the content and writing, this book will prove to be no more than a flash in the pan. Otherwise, we might expect ""Coulterian"" to replace ""Orwellian"" (now that Communism has been deposed) as the catchphrase for intolerance, anti-intellectualism, and heavy-handed obliteration of dissention."
5,Thank God for the Truth,"For years, I had suspected that Joe McCarthy was on to something and that there were soviet spies implanted in our government and liberat Democrat, Communist sympathizers were harboring them. Because he was so incessantly villified by the media, I thought, ""Well, either he is a beast or he is right on.""Now, I have the well-documented, undeniable evidence confirming the latter. This book pulls the big steel statue of liberal propoganda to the ground! I praise God He led me to this book.Finally, the hysterical liberal reactions to this book also confirm it's veracity. Isn't it great how God is using people to expose the perverse agendas of the traitors in our society these days?"
1,Proof that the right hates free speech.,"CBS pulls Reagan miniseriesTuesday, November 4, 2003 Posted: 1:54 PM EST (1854 GMT)NEW YORK (AP) -- Following a storm of protest and threatened advertiser boycott, the CBS television network announced Tuesday it was pulling ""The Reagans"" miniseries off the air. . . ."". . . the producers have sources to verify each scene in the script . . ."" the network said in a statement. . . .Supporters of the former president . . . were concerned the miniseries would be critical of him. The conservative Media Research Center had asked major advertisers to review the script and consider not buying commercial time on the show."
1,Sloppy Fact Gathering,"Ann, Please get your facts straight. Your book is full of exaggerations, and your quotes have been taken out of context. This book is flawed. However, the book makes perfect sense to those who read Coulter and do not bother to check her references because they find themselves automatically agreeing with her rhetoric. Just my two cents."
1,A Total Laff-Riot!,"Ms. Coulter's book is remarkably funny -- albeit perhaps not intentionally so. The section where she accuses Secretary of State (and one of the architects of the Allied Victory in World War II) George C. Marshall of treason made me laugh so hard I shot Diet Coke out of my nose.After I finished this book I put it on a shelf next to Al Franken's ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them"" to let them fight it out."
3,"Good facts, but not a history lesson","'Treason' contains some very good facts, especially dealing with the McCarthy hearings, the Rosenbergs, and other Cold War events. However, do not look at this book as a being a history lesson. Very relevant facts concerning liberals AND conservatives are not included when dealing with these historical events. All in all, if you liked Coulter's previous work, or either of Bill O'Reilly's books, this one ranks right up there. However, if you are a student of history and not a student of partisan politics, look elsewhere."
1,congratulations on finding an easy solution,"I am amazed that any free-thinking person would be so ignorant to believe the simple paradigm: Liberals=bad, conservatives=good. It is this thinking, not every liberal in America, that is destroying this country and has done nothing to serve it. Conservatives would be wise to abandon the useless rhetoric of Coulter just as liberals should best distance themselves from the likes of Michael Moore."
1,Nut Case For Sure!,This is one of those books that libraries should include in their banned books list. It's nothing but right wing trash at its best!
1,Poor thing doesn't know how to focus.,"Whatever case Coulter may have gets buried in an onslought of marginally relevant sarcasm and dissembling. This book panders to those who get an adrenaline high from name calling, which may be more fun than a reasoned analysis, like Doritos are more fun than broccoli. As intellectual nutrition, it's way negative."
1,Love is the answer,"Well, I hate this book. I think the logic in it is deeply flawed and narrow. I think that even when she has good historical points she's privy to 20-20 hindsight and is unable (or refuses) to digest the many external variables that effected historical events.But more importantly, I'm very concerned about the corrosive nature of this kind of book on the country. I'm worried that there is a growing group on the far-right of the spectrum, perhaps 10 million people, who read this like gospel and thus live in a sort of dream-reality. It's a very unhealthy trend.She constantly says that her adversary is 'evil'. I believe Evil exists. Stalin was evil. To say that it's a common trait is an irresponsible and incendiary practice.I don't think she can be discredited, because I'm not sure she is able to feel any shame at being proven wrong. She'll refuse to accept it and just keep on going. And of course she has her right to freedom of speech. I only hope the country can withstand her."
2,Pot Luck?,"I have always enjoyed Ann Coulter's columns, and I particularly starve for anything she writes when hard pressed to find an article. I was held captive by ""Slander"" and went right through it as I fed my appetite.""Treason"" on the other hand was not nearly the same menu. While it was written with the same passion as Ms. Coulter always expresses in anything she communicates, I found myself tiring of the repetitiveness of conclusions, particularly in the first half of the book.Due to the author's thorough investigation of her subject matter,as well as her wit, it did hold my interest enough to finish the entire book.In short, I feel as if I was given good meals, but had to eat too many leftovers afterward."
3,"I'm a conservative, but...","The book is so-so. My real problem with it is that Ann chops up far to many quotes, meaning you will see something like this ""I think...Ann Coulter...is right"" when the real quote could have been ""I think conservatives have it wrong. Ann Coulter is never right"" there are too many of those kind of quotes, but everything else is too soild to argue.If you are thinking about getting the book, get just for the sections on McCarthy, all her facts regarding him are very cut and dry.Overall liberals need to stop whinning about the title because that dosen't change the fact that they have been on the wrong side of histroy since WWII.In short read the book, but don't take everything to heart, read it carefully and know when the spin starts and stops."
2,Entertaining and Ridiculous,"The difference between Ms.Coulter and Micheal Moore, other than the obvious, is that while Micheal Moore knows that he is comical Ms. Coulter is unaware of how her over the top attacks are so outlandish that they become funny. It is good to know that some people consider liberals to be a threat(The mainstream media generally dismisses liberals as irrelevant and pathetic). Apparently Ms.Coulter is so paranoid about liberals that she may be a candidate for a straitjacket if she becomes any more frightnened of the impact of liberalism on the nation. The main plus of this book is that I'm sure most savvy Republican polticians consider Ms. Coulter to be no asset to their cause."
1,How to get nowhere: turn left only or right only...,"Amazing. ""Stupid White Men"" (Michael Moore's liberal book) and this (conservative) one. Is this bashing what the United States of America is truly about? (Hmm...maybe so...looking back at history I suppose it's nothing new).Try spinsanity dot com. No love for liberals or conservatives (or any other group) there...Pardon me, now. I need to dry my ""Old Glory""...it's becoming wet from my weeping..."
1,Blondness is temporary...fanatical stupidity is forever!,"Coulter's unrestrained, misinformed right-wing diatribes only reinforce my perceptions of the selfish ""we-must-win"" (""we"" being conservatives) and ""you-must-lose"" (""you"" being liberals/moderates) attack mentality held by those on the hard right. I was really, really hoping for some small attempts at objectivity, but came away disgusted and sad. I suggest that Annie keep using the peroxide for her book cover poses, because it will soon be the only thing selling her books to non-radicals."
1,Make money selling hate!,Ms. Coulter should have used the money she made from her first book of fiction to buy some talent!
1,"why don't you actually check your ""facts""","i am glad the book was written. in our society, the right of a person to speak their opinion should consistently be upheld. my opinion of this book is that ann has decided that her opinion is fact. not every liberal and not every conservative is incapable of compromise and agreement. this book would be admired by me if she were honest about what is fact and what is her opinion. attacking just to attack is pointless and educates no one."
1,Prejudice and Pride,My apologies to the trees that were sacrificed to make the paper. How scary that anyone who disagrees with the actions of his/her government can be labeled a traitor. This is brainwashing of the worst kind. What happened to ...'government FOR the people' not government by and for only the right wing. What are Ms Coulter's qualifications that she should be heeded with any sort of seriousness?
1,HOW?,How does Ann sleep at night???? - just plain evil - replace the word liberal with Jew and you'll see where she is going with this. Blame all the worlds problems on a group of people no matter who silly illogical...
1,Buyer Beware,"Attention all dittoheads, parrots, blowhards, Fox News junkies, and the rest of the weak minded and easily led: Don't read this book. It will only poison your mind further."
2,"William Buckley, where art thou?","I learned a lot from reading ""Treason."" I didn't know that President Kennedy was a traitor. Or that Joe McCarthy was a national hero. ""Treason"" is chock full of such information. School book publishers must be busy revising 20th century history books in light of Coulter's brilliant scholarship.Ann Coulter gives to Conservatives what Jerry Falwell gives to Christians - a bad name. I can understand that if one is as unhinged as she appears to be, it would give one solace to connect with those similarly afflicted -- by publishing a book. In other words: ""I can't be nuts; look at all the people who think the same way as I do."" What's harder to understand is why a reputable publisher would want to publish such rantings. Oh, that's right. The money.Coulter's last book put me to sleep. This one makes me cry. In politics, hatred is the lowest common denominator. If ""Treason"" truly reflects her views, Ann Coulter is a hater, not a Conservative."
4,My Revised and More Positive Review,"After having actually finished this audio-book, I must say Coulter argues her case better than I had previously thought, having listened to only to two-fifths of it (shame on me) before I wrote my three star review. She's got plenty of ammunition to show how inanity and asininity and, indeed, many instances of treasonous behaviour can be found in abundance coming from the mainstream American Left. Some of what she writes should be taken with a grain of salt. But to all too great an extent, it seems her attack on the Left is on target. If you are at all patriotic or anticommunist, by the end of this audio-book you will have to agree that Ann Coulter did us a big service in rendering this book which ""dared to call it Treason"". (I'll just add that I don't think *most* liberals are traitors, treacherous, or all around bad folk; mostly, just often terribly misguided, politically.)"
1,could not give 0 stars,"Ann Coulter simply makes no sense whatsoever. Her arguments are filled with rage and obsessive-compulsive anti-liberalism. I'm myself neither liberal nor conservative. As such I can't see what her argument really is. If she's a republican, sure, so be it. But to put out a book which I would argue is as ""slander""ous as she claims the left-leaning media is is nonsense.Sure she is half-way smart, and sure she makes some valid points. However, her over-zealous style, her irrational conversationalism, and some of her facts are dead wrong!Even if I were a conservative I would not read this book. Unless of course you're so full of yourself that you need to buy the book so that it can ""agree"" with your views."
3,"Fun read, Fascinating Facts, Needed Better Editing","Knowing how Ann Coulter speaks is imperative to ""hear"" the irony and sarcasm dished freely in this take-another-look history of Red Scare lore.The research is well-documented from source material, whether anti-McCarthy die-hards will care for it is another matter. You have to admire her Moxie as she brass-knuckles every Commie sympathizer ""out there."" Yet, the style never allows the reader to take a decent breath. Really unfortunate is the constant referencing of personalities that only news junkies like myself would know without a contextual prompt. And would even someone like myself know who some of the lesser-knowns are in another 5 years? Definitely worth reading for the new take on the subject."
1,Please read the constitution,"Everyone has the right to voice their opinion. You say liberals are commiting treason?""Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to greater danger. It works the same in any country.""-Hermann Goering (1893 - 1946)Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, President of the Reichstag, Prime Minister of Prussia and Hitler's designated successorThe second in command of the Third ReichThat statement reminds me MORE than a little of facism. But thats just my opinion."
1,Typical Coulter Vitriol,"Miss Coulter's mediocre literary skills are once again evident in her latest whiney, often vitriolic attack on liberals, Democrats, and basically anyone who does not agree with her intolerant, narrow view of what the world should be. The only reason her books sell is because she appeals to a blindly loyal, ultra-conservative segment of our population who can't get enough of mean-spirited liberal bashing the kind of which Miss Coulter consistently spews. Also, Coulter is very good at self-promotion on any media outlet that will have her. Do not waste your time or hard-earned money on this hate-mongering rubbish!"
5,"Truth at last, Truth at last!","I never heard of Ann Coulter until I picked up Treason three months ago in an airport. I read this book with an open mind and since have conducted independant research on Ms. Coulters claims. Guess what...She's right!The truth can hurt. Fortunately Ann's great sense of humor, wit and superior intelligence helps to keep us from crying over the what we all know is true in our hearts.I read the mean spirited remarks left on other reviews. Ironically Ann mentions these traits.Verify her statements and you will know the Truth! I've never given multiple copies of books as gifts until ""Treason"". It's well worth your time and easily the best book of the year."

A person who betrays the nation of their citizenship and/or reneges on an oath of loyalty and in some way willfully cooperates with an enemy, is considered to be a traitor."
1,Vile spewings of a racist hag...,"Ann Coulter would have you think that any Democrat alive today who is for ""liberal"" policies like equal rights, women's right to vote, and eliminating racism are enemies of the state. It is dreadful to think that our country produced this vile bag of putrid. It's a great book if you love hate. If you want knowledge (or, preferably) wisdom that will inform you on politics today, I would suggest starting with the US Constitution, Fulbright's writings in 1966, The Holy Bible, or the writing of the Dalai Lama. Make love, not war... Peace."
2,For lazy intellectuals and small-town recluses only,"If Ms. Coulter presented a more compelling argument for why the right's perspective makes more sense instead of just insulting the left, I think this book would be more interesting. Sarcasm doesn't substitute for substance and playground insults (with a bigger vocabulary) may reinforce what some already believe but contributes little to American politics or thought. I pray (yes, pray) that foreigners who unfortunately happen to pick up this book don't think this is the best America is capable of."
5,TREASON: LIBERAL TREACHERY,I REALLY ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK VERY MUCH. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT BOOK. I REALLY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO READ.
2,Her sources dispute her work!,".If conservatives truly look to someone like Ann Coulter to be a leader in espousing their positions, then conservatism is worse off than I thought it was.For those who actually think that Ann Coulter's book Treason is a factual accounting of the McCarthy era, think again. One of the main sources that Ann footnotes is Ron Radosh. He is considered one of the most reputable scholars who have studied the McCarthy era in great detail.He is apparently appalled. This is what he had to say about Treason:""I am furious and upset about her book. I am reading it - she uses my stuff, Harvey Klehr and John Hayes, Allen Weinstein etc. to distort what we actually say and to make ludicrous and historically incorrect arguments...""Rather humiliating, wouldn't you say?."
1,political pornography (or unintentional political humor?),"So you want to know ""Will I like and agree with Ann Coulter's new book?"". It just so happens that the answer to that question is identical to the answers to the following questions:1) Was Harry Truman an evil genius who hid his communist sympathies by fighting a very unpopular war against communism in Korea?2) Could we have attacked China (Russia would probably have joined in) and won even though we were losing to the Chinese in North Korea?3) Was Joe McCarthy someone you would want your daughter to marry?Answer these yes and you'll love the book. Answer them no and you'll hate the book.At least it IS amusing."
2,Hurray for Tragic Humor!,"I've read Coulter's material before, and ""caustic"" doesn't accurately describe her. This, like many of her works, uses simple spin tactics (for Christ's sake, if you're going to spin, do it convincingly!), an odd mix of vocabulary (which leads me to believe she heavily relies on either a Thesaurus or an editor), and a nice wave of what can either be identified as stupidity or another spin device that looks like stupidity.It's people like this that make my day. If it weren't for people like Ann Coulter and the rest of the self-chained right, I wouldn't have something to giggle at. It's because of these people that I debate about religion and politics out of enjoyment."
1,What did I ever do to Ann Coulter?,"WowWow oh wowI believe I side with Al Franken when I say that Ann Coulter is an absolute nutcase. From sentence one she violently attacks liberals for being anti-American and conscious committers of treason. Now I don't know about any other liberals, maybe I missed the annual treason meeting flyer, but I haven't ever committed treason. Not ever. And, as those of us who read ""Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell Them"" by Al Franken, Ann's ""facts"" are often guilty of that crime against her. I am all for intelligent and poignant political books, but if this is the best Ann Coulter has to offer, I am not impressed. My real question, however, is this:Ann coulter, What did I ever do to you?"
1,Give me a break,"Can this woman please stop believing her own lies. George W. Bush- Grew up rich, average student, had everything handed to him, conservative president. Bill Clinton- Grew up poor, worked hard to get where he is, exeptionally smart, liberal president. Now tell me that there is not a moral difference between the two partys."
1,Giving blondes a bad name again ...sigh.....,"OK, this book is perfect if you are really into faux (oops, I mean FOX) news and Rush LImbaugh and the National Enquirer. The Republican party has skidded so far to the right that I think in today's coinage, Richard Nixon would have been a Democrat. One can hope that this nonsense being spouted by the GOP's ""blonde bombshell"" will spur more educated Republicans to vote for Howard Dean in 2004."
1,Who's lying now?,"If you purchase this book, you'll be helping Ann finance a touch up for her roots, which is a noble gesture. But if you'd like to see her true colors, buy Al Franken's new book ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them."" He and his Harvard research team expose her hateful ranting for what it is -- a steaming pile of BS. Wake up, people!"
1,Too childish,"I did not finish this book. I was actually looking forward to reading Ann's point of view, but could not get past her childish name-calling. I've heard more coherent arguments on a neighbourhood playground. Grow up Ms. Coulter."
5,Ann pulls no Punches,"I just read Treason and found it to be very well written. Ann Coulter cuts through all of the spin and lays out a very compelling case of treachery at the highest levels of of the Democratic Party. Agree or disagree, this book is very well written and researched. No wonder the Liberals are having such a fit. I would recommend that all of my liberal friends read this book. I don't think that rank and file Democrats are traitors and from what I gathered neither does Ms. Coulter. She is making a case against the Democratic Party Leadership. She calls its like she sees it."
1,Treason=awful,"Anne Coulter commonly calls people who disagree with her and her ideology, traitors. Disagreeing with Coulter or the right isn't treason, it is fighting and debating for a position you believe is right. It is the very essence of Americanism. She has been alive 40 plus years and she still doesn't grasp this fact. Unfortuately, she creates books basically on the same themes. Anyone who disagrees with her is disloyal. God forbid if Coulter got actual power in America. Strange how it is never disloyal to disagree with a leftwing president (as it isn't) but to do so with a rightwing president is according to Coulter and her buddies."
1,fact checkers,"I think Ann Coulter constucted this book to be misleading, mostly using endnotes. Some of the ""facts"" are simply untrue, and should be stated as opinions. I found the misrepresentation offensive. I couldn't finish it."
1,An upclose and personal look...,"If you want to see the conservative, radical right upclose and personal, read this book.What concerns me most is that (1) even though scholars dispute Coulter's ""findings"", people are buying into her revisionist view of history and (2) you're either ""with 'em"" or ""agin 'em""....and if you're ""agin 'em"", you're destined to burn in hell.We'll always have radicals at both ends of the spectrum, but what scares me is that this new breed of the radical right is so mean and hate-filled. Venom virtually drips off every page of this book.Our country was founded on freedom of speech and while I disagree with every word of this book, I'll fight to defend Coulter's right to say them.I wonder if she'd do the same for James Carville."
1,A new culture of hate.,"Slander, treason, all vitriolic aspersion of the right. You've read one of these books, and you read them all. They call it talk radio, I call it a culture of hate, fear and division. Put all the anti-liberal attacks in a row, and change the word ""liberal"" to any racial or ethnic slur, and you would have an uprising of outrage. Would the radical right re-write history and put liberals in a ghetto or concentration camp? Probably not, but their rhetoric feeds on a politics of hate. Liberals are no more a problem to society, than are true conservatives. Great movements and great leaders unite us. This type of scape goat rhetoric only gives its author a free pass on examining their own conscious. True, liberals could fall into the same trap. It is the nature of being human. We long for that which would bring us together, not drive us apart."
1,"history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.","""The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country."" --Hermann Goering"
1,Conservative intellectual??,"""Conservative intellectual"" is an oxymoron.It's amazing how easily this bimbo can draw a line across an arbitrary spot of the political spectrum and label everyone on one side a traitor."
1,Over-the-top Hatemongering,"If you could yell ""fire!"" in a crowded theater in book form, it would be this book. Slimey, horrible, and dishonest to the core. True conservatives should avoid this book. It makes conservatives look like hysterical nazis, which they are not."
1,Fiction (inarticulate fiction at that),"When the right has inarticulate bimbos such as Coulter, do they really need enemies?Coulter is like a two-year-old. She cries and whines about how everything is Clinton's fault. Sorry, Coult, but Clinton's not in charge anymore. 9/11 happened on Bush's watch. Bush lead us into the quagmire of Iraq. Bush is president over the largest national debt every, as well as the highest unemployement since his father.She's ugly too. Will someone give that woman a sandwich?"
2,Can She Be Believed?,"She is clever and good at insulting people. But the thing is, given the fact that she distorted and lied her way through her last book, how can any of her claims in this book be believed?Furthermore, it seems to me that a woman who contributed nothing to her country but secondhand smoke and empty chardonnay bottles really has no place to insult anyone's patriotism.It is amusing reading - sort of like watching a 6 year old work itself up into a tantrum. So on that level 2 stars."
5,Treason - A Skillful Treatise,"In her typical superb style, Ann Coulter brilliantly captures the left's love of all things anti-American. It's high time someone pointed out the truth about traitor Alger Hiss and the wholesale lies perpetuated by the left about Joseph McCarthy. History, as reported by the leftist media, has forever skewed the facts surrounding those events. I know, I was there. Ann Coulter got it right."
5,Good review of the damage done by liberals,This book is a good review of the damage the liberals have done to this country in the last century and what their motives actually are. This helps to understand the roots of some of the foreign policy problems that we have today. Anne has done a lot of well documented research for this book and I would put more faith in some of this than in many american history textbooks in our schools today. I would recommend anyone read this from highschool an older especially if the have had to sit through a typically liberal biased college class.
1,Whose Treason?,"There is a word for people like Ann Coulter who try to justify Joseph McCarthy and then use the word ""traitor"" to describe opponents of Corporate controlled government. The word is Fascist.Frau Coulter should also remember that in 1776 ""conservatives"" were called Tories. In 1861 they were rebels, copperheads and slave owners. In the 1950s-1970s they were called segregationists and were responsible for America's bad image whenever we ranted on about ""freedom""."
5,Courage to tell the truth,"I have traveled over much of the world and most intelligent and educated people marvel at how easily our press has been slanted to the left.Ann Coulter is fearless in revealing the truth of historical facts hidden by the Communist supporters who were funded directly from the Soviet Union as was finally revealed in the Venona project when it was declassified.People who are guilty can't afford to sue. They can't afford the additional press about the truth. Those who condemn Ann Coulter as being untruthful do so with slander in the media. But no one seems to be taking her to court for libel. I wonder why, since so many proven Communist lawyers came out of Havard.This is an excellent book that was fully researched and really opens your eyes as to how we got to where we are."
1,DoctorIf,"Once again, Ann Coulter's work makes a strong argument for the revival of both witch-burning and book-burning. As long as its just this one witch and just this one book. Seriously, it's like political soft-porn for Conservative nutcases. I will say this about Ann, she does have better hair than most Conservative women. She probably stole it from poor people who ""weren't working hard enough to deserve such nice hair and would rather smoke crack instead,"" right Ann?Anyone who takes this book in the least bit seriously needs to increase their Lithium medication, cause the current dosage clearly ain't working."
5,Super-charged and right on target,"Ann Coulter nails the liberals and the left for their smug indifference to America and their constant siding with America's foes. While pretending just to be smarter than the rest of ordinary America, what the left and the liberals have been again and again are dupes of every America-hating dictator to come along in the last 50 years. You name the dicatator and she'll find the examples where liberals stood up for him and cast doubt on America's goals. As for Liberals and lefties, theirs is a sad record, and it's one Ann has carefully documented. The subjects sad, but Ann's mockery is the best cure. Maybe even one or two liberals will consider why they hate flag-waving Americans, Reagan, Bush, anti-communism, and anti-terrorism. Maybe."
2,Another hate monger heard from,"This is another in the long line of ""literary"" attempts to promote the cycle of mistrust among Americans. The conservatives hate the liberals, and the liberals hate the conservatives. Meanwhile media ""stars"" like Ms. Coulter just count their money as we become a little bit more contemptuous toward our neighbors. I will give her an extra star for having the faith that people will not one day get wise to this broad brush technique. She then may have to go out to survive in our world, as William F. Buckley she is not."
1,No stars,"This book is a total waste of time. I try to read books from both sides and try to stay neutral, even though most of the time I lean to the right. However, this book will not give you any information or any ideas. It is a collection of cutouts and out of text quotes from different newspapers. There are comments of highly opinionated and stupid woman, with no proper education, knowledge, and background to comment on any of her sources. Pretty much every paragraph in her book is absurd, some contain stupid blabbers, some are taken directly from fantasyland. Everything she says about Soviet Union and cold war is lies. Everything she said about Truman and Roosevelt is lies. She might be mad, but that does not make her a worthwhile reading material. Do not waste your time - read something else."
1,A significant contribution to the culture of rage in America,"""Have you no decency, madam? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?"""
2,Lost Among Labels,"This book makes the common mistake of dividing Americans intoliberals and conservatives. Such a neat division of citizens does not exist. Worse yet, the book leads the reader to believe that outside of the liberal/conservative labels, there are no other opinions worth discussing. Anyone who writes a book today and ignores the wealth of different positions, as can be found on the Internet for example, writes such a limited book at their own peril. It is not necessary to explain all opinions in detail, however the lack of discussing possibilities such as the New World Order and other supposedly fringe ideas is a glaring ommission. America is not a country divided into two groups. Talkshows and authors would like us to believe so to make their job easier. I am concerned about the publishing industry when a book with such a limited world view appears. Ms. Coulter does a disservice to herself by ignoring other influences on events in the USA and around the world."
1,what is wrong with her?,"After reading several pages, I feel disgusted. She is exactly like the Hard core leftest in China. She would kill all the students in the Square if she is a chinese. And she would call everybody with a PhD a treason. What has she done for her country while she calls others treasons? She is talking nonsense."
1,You can dress a pig in lipstick,"Self-delusional hack and supporter of Bush's arrogant, imperial presidency doesn't write about how George W. screwed up on Osama or Saddam. No, she's busy demonizing liberal Democrats."
1,OTHER BOOKS FOR FANS OF ANN!,"If you love this book, there's another book from a German author you'd probably dig. It's called ""Mein Kampf."""
1,What a bunch of lies,"Read Al Franken's Lies and the Lying Liars that Tell Them. He calls Coulter's bluff 100%, and exposes her as a simple-minded, hateful, straight-up liar. This book is among the dregs of ""political"" writing out there, and an embarrassment to political ""debate."""
1,"This book should be entitled ""Slander""","The good news is that Ms. Coulter is an entertaining writer. She has a way with words and can be quite humorous. The bad news is that she embodies the same brand of vitriol and extremism that motivates some to shave their heads, paint swastikas and burn crosses. This book is to be recommended to only the blindly conservative and not mainstream America."
1,Soviet-style hatchet job,The style of argumentation in this book will remind readers of the tirades against US-based capitalism that used to come out of the former Soviet Union: demonize the enemy. That's all this is. Turn the opponent into inhuman mush.I am endlessly amazed how much extremists around the world have in common.
1,where horrid meets insipid,"when you don't have to back anything up, slander can be made to look like analysis"
1,Save the hatred for the real bad guys.,"This book scares me and I still lose sleep over it.Too much hate.Go ahead people, disagree, but go easy on the hate.If you love your country, you've got to love yourneighbor, even just a little bit.Save the hatred for the real bad guys."
1,Please save us!,"It is a shame that those who profess to ""expose truth"" can't even compose a sentence correctly.The last review to anoint this crappy, misleading, hate-mongering book with a 5 star review should have read something like:Wonderfully put: this book exposes truths about the Liberal party (I wasn't aware we had a liberal party) and the lies and deceit that has (Should be ""have""...you see it is plural) run rampant (can lies really run rampant?...I am so glad there are no lies running around these days...thank god people like Ann Coulter are so good at running the lie roundup!) for decades (decades in which republicans have either been in charge or had a fair shake in maters....unlike the blockade on justice GWB has instilled)."
1,"Too bad Steve Martin already has the title ""Pure Drivel""",Do we really need to exhume McCarthy and pretend he was good for America? Ms Coulter seems to think so. Her catty remarks on Good Morning America betray her true role: the court jester in the new right-wing media order.Pat Buchanan must be proud.
1,God have mercy on Coulter's soul...,"Ann Coulter's take on patriotism is quite amazing. With her astounding logic, she concludes that anyone who uses their rights as an American to question the government is the most thoroughly disgusting unpatriotic citizen. Oh, but not only are the liberals unpatriotic, they hate America too!As a liberal myself, you understand how astounded I was when I learned how much I hated the country. Please note the sarcasm.There are other conservative writers who, while I may not agree with them, do not twist the facts. Coulter does boarder on insane. While her analysis on liberalism disgusts me, the reviewers who seem to not be able discriminate between facts and the lies she spews out make me cringe in fear."
1,"Opportunistic Nincompoopery..Hannity, Moore and now Coulter","How long will we reward those who write fiction and call it history? We need to hear from history scholors, not opportunitic name-callers, who conjure up outrageous and laughable accounts of history to make a buck. Coulter is simply not relevant. If you have to read this dribble, go check it out at the library or pick it up in a dustbin."
2,If you love VINEGAR this is the book for you!,"I love a vinegar-based salad dressing, but who wants to drink a whole bottle straight?!? Likewise, I'm a strong conservative and I appreciate the author's intent in this work, but who wants to read 300+ pages of vinegar. Where Ms Colter is correct gets lost in the constant sarcasm and cynicism. Every good point in her book has a bitter after-taste. Do we really have to be so sour when we're right? Humility in victory is always admired, but you'll find none here. Instead, you find what could have been 300+ pages of sound perspective turned into 300+ pages of prideful prose. Though she describes some wretched people in her book, she over extends the reach of objectivity when attacking some (George C. Marshall comes to mind). It seems in her attempt to bring historical balance, Ms Colter lost her own, fell into a mire of ego, and then sullied her work with stainful and distracting smugness."
1,Schlock Mistress,I was surprized to see that Ann Coulter does not recommendMein Kampf as additional reading!This book is drivel from a knee-jerk reactionary bimbo who should be hailed as a female Wally George.
1,Horrible,"She writes on the level of a 4th grader, and her logic connecting her statements probably is even worse."
1,YAWN...........,"I read this book because having seen AC on television and not understanding her, I was curious about how her mind worked. A few chapters in I realized that it did'nt work. This woman is not a profound thinker - She's a hack, there was not one original idea in this book, just a tired agenda poorly veiled in bad writing . As a proud republican I feel it is my duty to stand up and condemn these consrevofanatics posing as republicans - The republican party is for grownups Miss Coulter, go play with the other children."
1,Why are people buying this book?,"This book is for the intellectually challenged and the ideologically indulgent. Yet a bestseller, just like ""Stupid White Men"" by Michael Moore. Stop buying hateful, innacurate pieces of fiction like this."
2,You guessed it--what else is new?,"This is the most brilliant contribution to political economy since Marx's Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right. Indeed, a strange thing happened on the way to government by the bourgeoisie, government of the bourgeoisie, government by the bourgeoisie--far too many, if not most by a long shot, were left without musical chairs, and were only included in order to be excluded. It is a strange system of schizophrenia, has been ever since. Heavens, at last count forty three million without health insurance are traitors, they should know better, drop dead as patriots. If the Bush admin keeping beating around the bush like this, it could end badly, a majority of traitors. Brilliant analysis. Good self-help book for liberals having an identity crisis--get it straight, finally. We can close with the words of the drunken porter in Macbeth,'Knock, knock, ...forsooth'."
4,Jeez,"All you 1 and 5 star folks, get a grip! This book is ENTERTAINMENT! It isn't really supposed to be a political statement. It's parody! Ann Coulter is brilliant! You folks probably take Al Franken and Rush Limbaugh seriously as well. Let me clue you in: they're all best friends! I would laugh my **** off if america toppled because it had no sense of humour. Talk about poetic justice..."
3,the matrix,"the left vs right deal is really just a way to enslave people, a game , a distraction. coulter is merely playing her part and makin' some solid dough. the one thing all those who's livelihood is derived from the rightvsleft scam must at all costs discredit, scorn or better yet pretend doesnt exist is the libertarian option(or any other option for that matter). Does Coulter know exactly what shes doing? No, she probably actually believes in conservativism. Carrol Quigley(rhodes scholar, teenage harvard PHD, voted Georgetowns ""most influencial prof"" 20 yrs in a row, Clintons mentor) best explains the scam in ""Tragedy and Hope"". But our power elites have changed gears and this stage will be drastically different from the last (ie Coulter might want to heed the warning sounded in the elites manifesto written by Solomon Tulbure)"
5,"Why some admire the book, why some can't read the first page","Dear Potential Buyer,This book is one of the few in print that contains a bibliography full of trustworthy, primary resources. There is no contradicting the facts brilliantly portrayed by Ann Coulter. This is why intellectualists and people who value truth find this book to be one of the greatest sources of information of our time. However, those who would rather be fed biased opinion-facts from geocities.com have a hard time making it through the first page. They also have difficulty spelling when writing their reviews."
1,Pure Hyperbole.,"Do your self a favor and do not buy this book. It is written (Very poorly I might add) by a women who has quite obviosly lost touch with realty and whose only wish is that america returns to the parinoid, discriminating time that was the fifties."
1,"ms. coulter and revisionist history, redux","more outright distortions of facts, more choppy quotes, and more gradeschool namecalling-classic coulter! makes a joke of political discourse, much as her left-wing counterpart michael moore. half-baked platitudes aplenty! ah, to read a book like this is to blindside all common sense and adhere to a political party as though it were the mouthpiece of god.ms. coulter lives in a bizarro fantasy world where any form of disagreement is ""treasonous."" oddly enough, i'm thinking this is the book she should have titled ""slander."""
5,Consider the source,"Has anyone else noticed that the leftist anti-America gang is loading up the user reviews with nothing but ad hominem nonsense for all of the conservative books (all best sellers mind you). The liberal agenda has everyone so brainwashed that they no longer feel compelled to think and formulate honest arguments for their ludicrous positions so they just hurl insults and then try to make this book appear that it only rated two or three stars. Unlike their unkind remarks, Ann happens use facts to back up all of her assertions. In case you've forgotten, a fact is something that has actual existence.When you read this book, you will see why they resort to insults - they have no logical reason to hold their opinions, only hatred. This is a five star book from start to finish. When reading user's reviews, please consider the source.While you're at it, pick up a copy of one of the books on the Venona Papers - you'll see first hand that Ann is correct!"
3,"Book Content Zero, Cover Excellent","I admire Anne Coulter for the quality that gives pleasure to the mind or senses and is associated with such properties as harmony of form or color, excellence of artistry, truthfulness, and originality, but I don't respect her silly opinions."
2,More of the Same - Rank Partisan Claptrap,"Another mostly worthless piece by conservatives' favorite dim bulb. As a conservative myself, I'm rather embarrassed to have someone like Coulter considered to be a shining star in the ""movement."" But, then again, her fans are the same ones that essentially told George Washington to stick his 200-year non-preemptive war ideas where the sun don't shine ... in favor of the neo-conservate experiment in benevolent hegemony. What has become of the world? Do words and ideas no longer have meaning? What's next? Liberals whining about budget deficits?"
1,As a liberal,"I find this book to be a direct threat on my life. Treason is punishable by death and/or life imprisonment. If she can go around on a witch hunt such as this and have a following, I worry about the future of our country and the world. No wonder she is an apologist for McCarthyism, she wants to be the next one to point out the ""reds under your beds"". Do people ever learn? Here vision of history is completely skewed. Go take a course in recent American history to learn what was happening."
1,"""0"" Stars","Pure junk! I couldn't make it through the lies and half-truths. Ms. Coulture -- instead of making things up, why don't you get your facts straight first? A book so full of hate -- unreadable.How did a book like this get published?"
1,Lies! Worst form of Propaganda for Bush ever!,"This is the worst book I have ever read. It is filled with nothing but lies. Ann is a nut and need psychiatric care. People, please, let's get real. There is no treason amoung liberals. There are just questions. Last time I checked this is a free country and everyone has the right to agree or disagree with President Bush. Just because I disagree with Bush, doesn't make me a traitor.The Fox News Network has an aganda. They want Bush reelected. Make sure you get the facts before you believe anything that Fox says. They make up lies everyday and not one of them is against Bush or rebulicans.Wake up America and vote Clark in 2004!"
1,Who is this lady?,"I had never heard of Ann Coulter until a friend of mine loaned me this book. After reading it, I have to admit that Al Franken was correct."
1,When Ms. Coulter Writes the Same Drivel Over and Over...,"How does she expect to keep it fresh? How many times can one individual write the same incessant whining about how ""Liberals"" are supposedly responsible for everything that has gone wrong, or could possibly go wrong, in the history of America?Who would possibly want to hear more of Ms. Coulter's nasty, whining complaints? If she wants to be taken seriously as a writer, she'd be well-advised to go about attacking ""Liberals"" in a more sane and even-keeled manner. Ann's defense of McCarthyism is so over the top...it's downright laughable!Like all of Ms. Coulter's book, this one is light on fact and heavy on projection. Perhaps the author could take a break from her incessant whining about ""Liberals"", and for once take a critical look at Conservative politics."
1,This book stinks!!!,Poorly written right wing trash. Ann Coulter has a reputation for making abnoxious insensitive comments about everything from Vietnam veterans to immigration. Here comments were inflammatory enough after 9/11 for the right wing National Review to fire her. Here latest book is another attempt to inflame the masses with shock jock prose with ideas that seem borrowed from Adolf Hitler and Joe McCarthy. Save yourself some money and buy a real book by a great intellectual like Noam Chomsky and lean the real motive behind conservatives like Coulter.
3,all the wild horses,"First off, let me admit that for most of my adult life I, too, hated America. I it was that piloted the tank Dukakis, it was me next to Ms. Beret in the famous film clip, I lofted snark at the Studmuffin in Chief as he strode fearlessly in his state-of-the-art flight suit.Ann H. Coulter changed me. Not so much because of her book, which, friends, we all know is a tedious melange of newspaper clips and hysterical lunacy. It is those liquid eyes, that manly posture, the equine countenance. I saw the future of rock-and-roll last night & it was me making love to Ann H. Coulter. Let Freedom Ring!"
1,Shame on you Ms. Coulter.,"Treason is a very strong and loaded word to throw around. The casual use of it to describe those who simply hold a different point of view is indicative of the gutter tactics of the right. Anyone can search through historical events and spin them whatever way they want to find examples of ""treason"" on EITHER side of the political spectrum. Like for instance, a certain administration's connection with Saudi Arabia and it's aid in helping Saudi's citizens in the USA get out of America in the days after 9-11. For that matter, sleeping at the wheel while the 9-11 plot was being hatched - right under our noses in our own country - could be considered treason. Well, if not treason, how about dereliction of duty? Which is pretty much the same thing. The author of this book should be ashamed of herself."
1,A sad example of radical right-wing fanaticism,Don't bother buying this book. Coulter doesn't present facts or explore issues from an unbiased point of view; only her radical unsubstantiated opinion. It's people like Coulter that promote hatred and intolerance.
1,Hoodwinked,"Let's see... I'm trying to think of a way to make a few quick bucks. Hmmm... I know that there are quite a few redneck ignoramuses in this country who buy books written by idiots that make them feel justified in holding their hateful, myopic, antiquated, paranoid, fear-mongering views... How about if I wrote a book full of hateful, myopic, antiquated, paranoid, fear-mongering views... Maybe those ignoramuses would buy it, cause they're just that dumb... and the dumber the book is... the more ignoramuses will buy it .... and I'll make more money from them because they're dumb enough to throw away their money on that kind of crap.... Hey, I'll just be telling them what they want to hear.. they won't care if it's true or accurate or cheapens the political debate in the country... All I know is.. I'll make money!!!!!"
1,Idiots like this make me lose my hope for the future.,I can't believe people this close-minded and hateful exist. Absolutely ridiculous.
3,It's what I expected...,"I am a proud liberal and was not surprised by this book at all. She has always been a staunch conservative and at times an extreme conservative. I disagree with 99% of what she has to say in this book! It is exactly what I expected from her, but what disturbs me is the unfortunate review byReviewer: Randy Herr from Los Angeles, CA USA NOvember 8, 2003.It is the hateful and ignorant comments like Randy Herr that trivializes our cause. I have to admit that the most hateful and at times most ignorant actions have come from my side.(&quot;THe Left&quot;) Its a shame that we can't respectfully disagree with each other without resorting to this immature/ignorant speech.I recommend this book for everyone, especially my fellow liberals. Let her book do the talking for our side. She will do us well on her own."
2,"Oh, seriously...","All right. Let's get past the partisanship for a moment and forget about Ann Coulter's political views.Let's instead look at how she jumps to conclusions; resorts to slippery-slope arguments (p. 13); exaggerates her opponents' foibles while downplaying her allies'; and compares the opposition to children (p. 14) and animals (p. 56). Between that, her excessive use of loaded words (the book's very title, for example), and her constant schoolyard insults (wasn't she also the author of a book called ""Slander,"" and wasn't it about how her *opponents* can't argue without resorting to name-calling?), she's about as fit as Michael Moore to offer a serious political opinion.So...what's the difference, apart from their positions on the political spectrum, between Ann Coulter and Michael Moore?Moore presents himself as a comedian. And as far as I know, he's *never* presumed to speak for God."
1,Exciting books coming soon from Ann Coulter:,"For all you fans, here's what Ann's cookin' up for you next:""How America was Fooled: Why Hilter was right to attack the USSR""""Churchill and Roosevelt: As Red as Satan's Cape""""Father Coughlin -- The American Father""""Mr. Chamberlain: The Right Man, Wronged"""
1,IT OBSCENITY AND SHOULD NOT BE PROTECTED SPEECH,"A great Supreme COurt Jusitce once said about obscenity, "" I know it when I see it.""This book is obscene. Not only is it untrue, it has no redeeming social merit, it is calculated to incite lawlesness and it falls outside the realm of protected speech. It is not the left which is treasonous, it is the extreme right, of which COulter is a card carrying member. WHo needs Osama bin Laden to destroy this country when we have the likes of COulter?"
5,Funny and Damning,"Liberals won't like this book. It wasn't written for them. It was written about them, and it's not very flattering. Ann Coulter attacks them where it hurts--with their own words. It's chockablock full of quotes from prominent liberals and liberal institutions (e.g. the New York Times). The result is both funny and damning.This is not a light read. The information is often upsetting. It's hard to believe that people really said or did these things. Even today some simply refuse to be convinced--the people for whom Alger Hiss will always be innocent regardless of the evidence. These folks are the OJ jury of the left, and Ann dispatches them effortlessly with her carefree wit.One quote from Treason is enough to give you a taste for the whole thing: ""Jimmy Carter claimed to have been attacked by a giant swimming rabbit. That's really all you need to know about the Democrats."""
1,Treason,"Although I have not read the book, and will NOT waste money on this piece of drivel, I just wanted people to know I saw this woman's interview tonight on the Hannity program on Fox. The woman is sadly lacking in professional writing skills. Can I say she is an idiot? Please do not waste money buying this book."
1,"Read David Brock's ""The Republican Noise Machine""","Read David Brock's ""The Republican Noise Machine: Right-Wing Media and How it Corrupts Democracy"" and learn how propaganda like this gets published."
5,eye opening,"I am listening to it for the second time. It has really opened my eyes about things I was not sure about. The use of footnotes is very helpful. I bought the book for that info, while I listen to the CD. I also enjoyed Slander."
3,This book must be deeply biased,"This book must be deeply biased. From all customer reviews posted here, I found so many love it to the tip, and so many hate it to the bottom. Here is the statistics of the stars this book received:94 5-stars6 4-stars2 3-stars7 2-stars71 1-starsSo I have decided to not waste my money and time on this book. I should not believe such pundits.Finally, not to affect the existing rating, I will give it 3 stars."
2,Snooze,"Many reviews have been posted concerning the content, I'll focus on the style.One word: boringI am an open minded person, and I believe the truth lies in the middle. Which is why Michael Moorer's book is so entertaining, as it is the polar opposite of books from the right. My issue with this book is that Ms Coulter is so dry and boring. Its very difficult to keep focused on the material."
1,"First as tragedy, now as farce",The latest offering of recycled McCarthyism from the Anna Kournikova of the far right.For true believers and the intellectually dishonest only.
1,Ugh!,"I browsed through ""Treason"" in a book store. I would not buy it and am glad I did not waste (more) time reading it. Coulter's ""scholarship"" seems weak and ""facts"" skewered to support her thesies. Looks like a book that plays to it's audience: right wingers who need assurance that they are ""right"" and anyone even slightly to the center or left is guilty of high treason. Only recommended for center/left leaning folks who need a laugh or a target for barbs. If you need a Coultler fix, check out Fox; I understand she's on just about every day."
1,Worthless.,"This would be a good book, if the world were as black and white as Coulter would like you to believe. She continously groups all Americans under two umbrellas, liberal and conservative. Congratulations Anne, you are unoriginal and mediocre. While I was a bit dismayed that she took the easy way out in the beginning, I was hoping that she would have a strong argument. Nope. She argues all right, but her argument is largely circular, and it has absolutely no facts to back it up. In the first few pages she claims a US senator lauded Bin Laden for his work on child daycare centers. Who? When? What was the context? It did not get any better. If you want to read the rants of a delusional ugly blonde, then by all means, waste your money. Otherwise, I suggest something else...anything else for that matter."
1,Unanswered questions,"I don't get it...Ann tells us all about how America's take on McCarthy is wrong. But if it was, why didn't we fall to communism? If he had been correct and we took him out of power (before anyone had been prosecuted) wouldn't we be under communism now?And why didn't she mention those other ""liberals"" that were against McCarthy too (I.E. Eisenhower & Barry Goldwater)?And the way she goes on about McGovern (calling him a commie). He was a World War II bomber pilot, son of a minister and married his high school sweetheart-if that's not an American...what is? Ann should be so American!!What's Ann going to tell us next? Hitler was misunderstood??"
1,The bitter truth...,"Unfortunately, one of things that we Liberals must all admit is that the good-looking people are usually right-wing people. Ann Coulter is a very attractive blonde woman, and it is my personal experience that attractive people, men or women, tend to be wealthy and conservative. Meanwhile, those of us on the left tend to be fat and unattractive ... like me. Looks are what it's all about today. My other observation -- borne out well by the contents of this book -- is that, when one is physically unattractive, you tend to have to work hard to get things in life; the beautiful people, on the other hand, tend to get things handed to them. Like Ann Coulter. And this is what -- I'm afraid -- clouds her judgement."
1,Nut Case,"Is it really true that conservatives think this woman has a point to make? Is it really within the pale to argue that all democrats are deliberately seeking the overthrow of the USA? Really, even John Kerry, Bob Kerrey, and Dan Inoye who left parts of their bodies in Viet Nam?? While there will always be freakishly extreme views on both the right and left, what bothers me is that no one on the right is willing to say that this profiteering priestess of extreme right wing radicalism goes much, much too far. Sean Hannity, a so-called journalist, even salutes her ""patriotism"". This is not patriotism, or political dialogue, but rather a form of demonizing one's opponents so extreme that Goebbels himself should take notes."
4,A Good Start,"For the unititiated, this book is a good starting point into the world of political deception. For the initiated there are some new insights and a reminder of things past. Ms. Coulter has laboriously cited the facts in her work to original source material, understanding who would be on the front lines targetting her.For those who have read the book, the 1-star commentaries given here are completely predictable, in scope and in style.Liberals would rather engage in personal attacks than actually read the facts and put together a substantive rebuttal. Unless liberals learn to deal with facts, they too will end up in the ash heap of history, as a curiosity."
1,Incoherent ranting,"The belle of New Canaan, CT has done it again! Only she could pass Joe McCarthy off as an American hero while slandering anyone to the left of Ronald Reagan. And isn't it great that her heroes propped up Saddam Hussein, Pinochet, Marcos, et al?"
1,Who gave birth to this nut case?,"Ann's research and reasoning are sloppy, at best...this book isn't worth anyone's time. There is a lot of hatred in this screed."
1,I wrote the same review about Franken's Book,"This book, much like Franken's inane ""Lying Liars..."", is part of the growing uncivility in today's political discourse. Instead of making logical arguments about improving Americans' daily lives, these pundits on both sides of the aisle focus on vicious personal attacks. It is a testament to their uselesness that none of these books actually contain prescriptions to IMPROVE the average person's life.It is easy to debase other people and to find flaws in other's positions and arguments but much harder to find solutions. From now on, I will only read political books that contain ideas/suggestions instead of the usual bile."
2,So much for historically accurate&#65533;.,".If conservatives truly look to someone like Ann Coulter to be a leader in espousing their positions, then conservatism is worse off than I thought it was.For those who actually believe that Ann Coulter's Treason is a factual accounting of the McCarthy era, think again. One of the main sources that Ann footnotes is Ron Radosh. He is considered one of the most reputable scholars who have studied the McCarthy era in great detail.He is apparently appalled at Ms. Coulter's writings. This is what he had to say:""I am furious and upset about her book. I am reading it - she uses my stuff, Harvey Klehr and John Haynes, Allen Weinstein etc. to distort what we actually say and to make ludicrous and historically incorrect arguments....""I'll give it two stars for the amusement factor.."
1,"Annie, didn't your Mama tell you not to lie?","Problem is - she believes her lies.But the good part of all this is - we don't have to, no matter how many times they get published by some misguided publisher, or read and subscribed to by patently ignorant people.Fascism lives in Coulter's mind, but not in my America. Fortunately, the two are not the same. And never will be."
5,Coulter strikes again,"Ann Coulter does it again.With both brilliance and wit she exposes the left and all it's duplicity.Having lived through the periods in question I can say unequivocally that Ms Coulter has both the facts and the truth on her side. This book is a must read for anyone who wishes to know what happened during the Cold war and why. Also for younger readers I would recommend the Black Book of Communism , and The Long March (by Roger Kimball)."
1,Lieson: Ann Coulter's Treachery from Slander to Treason,"Oh man, I've never read so many pathetic lies and cheap shots in one stack of papers. This woman should limit herself to writing one page per book, because whenever she writes at least two she ends up contradicting herself at some point.Save yourself some money and buy the book of a conservative who has facts and takes positions on issues, instead of just attacking the other side."
3,She and Michael Moore are two sides of a coin,"Looking at a distance from England, Coulter and Moore are two sides of a coin. However, apparently, people who bought this book also bought CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003), so I am not going to complain too much - except to say that the best way to make your case is to do so rationally and calmly, something alas that both Coulter on the right and Moore on the left seem to lack. Why not read EJ Dionne on the liberal side and Charles Krauthammer on the conservative side - both people who hold deeply to their views without in any way going over the top. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)"
5,Ann Coulter is GOD,"Her book is amazing. It is footnoted heavily, and totally -- with documentation -- destroys myth after myth that the liberals have foisted upon the public for decades.Coulter is a beauty with a sharp, scalpel-like tongue. She destroys weenie liberals with a tilt of her gorgeous head and a snappy, eviscerating comment. If I could, I would marry her. Then, I would marry her again. And again. And for good measure, I would then propose marriage.Only rarely do you meet a woman with this combination of beauty and brains."
1,Let's go Ann!,"This book, in all its might and glory, has further shown that the American right is becoming more and more out of touch with reality. Defending Joseph McCarthy? Lord.Hey Ann, how many Communists are in the State Department again?"
1,Embarrassing to conservatives,"This book is beyond bad. In fact, it is so bad it becomes hysterical. If you can stretch your mind so far as to believe UFOs existed or that dinosaurs never did then you probably will enjoy this little book. If you think I'm lying, just read the chapter on McCarthy. Ann Coulter is not a good voice for conservatives. She spews nothing but hatred and can hardly be called a good Christian by the things that she says. If you're looking for a good fantasy book or something that will make you laugh your butt off then, by all means, read it. Just rent it from the library... :-)"
1,let's just ignore her,"It is the worst thing for this woman and the best thing for this country to just ignore what she says.There is no ""liberal"" or ""conservative."" Once you classify yourself or others in certain category, then you are restrained by those classifications. You are no longer able to think in fair and balanced manner. Partisanship is dangerous, if it goes too far."
1,The Right's ...,"...P>Coulter's revisionist history of the McCarthy era is quite telling. Never mind that innocent people had their lives and career destroyed by McCartthy's ultimately self promoting grandstanding and never mind that it was the REPUBLICAN party that eventually censured him -- not the Democrats that Coulter so enjoys painting with one sweeping broad brush as pinko lefties. But in Coulterland one should never let the facts get in the way of the bucks one can rake in by catering to the lowest common denominator.I'll give her this. Coulter knows her audience and knows just the kind of red meat that will get them marching into bookstores (where they no doubt are shocked to see that there are so many different kinds of books for sale) but ultimately this is not a compliment. Pity she can't, or won't, take the opportunity to enlighten them rather than just pandering and feeding their fear and ignorance over some vast, left wing conspiracy."
1,Stunningly Hypocritical,"Ann Coulter thesis in her book is just what the title promises. Small problem. Coulter neglects to inform her readers about the most recent spectacular case of treason in America, and a case of treason that is actually factual. I am refering to Katrina Leung, a California businesswoman and powerful REPUBLICAN DONOR and ACTIVIST, who also happened to be a CHINESE SPY. The same time this Republican was having affairs with FBI agents she was on the FBI payroll and giving classified information to her Chinese bosses. Now that is treason. Don't hold your breath waiting for Coulter to cover this story in her next propaganda book, after all this Chinese spy was an important Republican."
1,Are we really this dumb?,"Coulter's ridiculous, meretricious latest should go over famously with the neo-Fascist, Rush Limbaugh set. Which is to say that if you find yourself with a double-digit IQ, with a tendency to move your lips while reading silently, with some sort of pro-Jesus bumper sticker on the back of your pickup truck, skip right out to the nearest bookstore and grab a copy.More discriminating intellects--while finding the tome fascinating in exactly the way a chance encounter with a well-cultivated mullet is fascinating--will quickly grow bored."
1,opinion as fact,"Here we see Annorexic Coulter doing what she does best - presenting her own extremely biased right wing OPINION as fact. She is known for this, as well as her need to gain as much publicity as possible, hoping to milk the well suckled Rush Limbaugh farm cash-cow, and appeal to the reichbots of America, who remain dedicated sheeple in their championing of any writer or pundit who echoes their rigidly conservative and anti-liberal viewpoint. Hey congratulations to her - she will get lots of money and a certain amount of waspy fame, but here is one girl who must sleep poorly at night knowing the amount of negativity she pours into her culture."
1,Fair and Balanced like Fox News,"Half her information is not even based on facts and a lot of it is just exaggeration to promote herself, if you want a real fair and balanced book about American politics get Bill Maher's book. Yes he is a liberal, but he is one that can even piss me off with some of his views, and also have my full support."
1,Sloppy writing - not worth the paper it is written on.,"All you die hard conservatives who love Ann Coulter, check out this column from the National Review (one of the most conservative online magazine and Ann used to write a column for them). http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment100301.shtmlYou may not believe Al Franken when he says Coulter mis-represents facts but here you have a conservative publication pretty much saying the same thing. After reading this, if you still believe Ann, contact me, I have a bridge that I need to dispose of."
1,Has Coulter ever heard of democracy?,"Treason, as discussed in Article 3, Section 3, of the U.S. Constitution, is a capital offense. To illustrate, let me state that I believe that many of G.W. Bush's policies are grievously mistaken, in paticular the invasion of Iraq. If anyone seriously believes this statement constitutes an act of treason, then by all means they should immediately contact the FBI. Otherwise, one might reasonably question how much credibility one should attribute to an author whose very title shows such a lack of understanding of our democratic traditions in these United States."
1,Slander author has done again,I think that Ann Coulter is thw worse face of the party. In the fact! that all she spew`s is hate! She does not make any resonable argument and in interviews on TV all she does in shout down everyone.
1,Coulter purposely lies and mispuotes in new book,"For those interested in a NONPARTISAN review of Treason go to spinsanity.com. They attack irrational rhetoric on both sides of the political debate, and present the truth, whether it's lies by liberals or conservatives. Highly recommened for people that have the ability to critically think and not be swept up in emotional tirades by either side."
1,ridiculous,somebody needs to tell this woman that the founding fathers of the good ol' US of A were liberal traitors.
1,History Written With Bias,"Ann Coulter has done it again. She's taken boring bits of history and filled a book with them. She spends 125 pages (out of 300) explaining how liberals lambasted Senator Joe McCarthy. She fills the book with tidbits of innuendo that lead one to believe that no liberal can be trusted with anything, ever. She plays up and exaggerates facts, and plays up and exaggerates fictions. My belief is that Ann was seduced and deflowered by a liberal Democrat who then dumped her, and so she's got a chip on her shoulder about liberals and Democrats. That, or she hasn't had good sex in a long, long, long time."
5,Read the Book before reviewing it!,"It is obvious that most of these reviewers giving this book negative reviews have not even read it. There is even one reviewer thats states that Ann ""accuses the entire Democratic Party of treason but will not name one person, living or dead, as being guilty of that serious crime."" I don't know what book he read but it wasn't Ann Coulter's ""Treason."" This book in fact has many names of people who are liberals that were proven soviet spies who regularly communicated with moscow and also organized the infiltration of other soviet spies in the top levels of our government. They were protected by the liberal establishment and the press, especially the New York Times. This book is filled with meticulously reasearched facts and all the sources are listed. No one could have researched it better. Even if you are going to give this a negative review at least read the book so yo know what you are talking about!"
4,Fact filled and intriguing,"Ann Coulter doesn't mind saying what she thinks. In this book she applies her spin to the political history of the McCarthy era. Her points are explained logically with concise details of history as she percieves it.This book certainly has a spin to it, but it also inspires thought and prodded me into doing a bit more research. I enjoy books that take a stance that is contrary to popular opinion and value them for inspiring thought and debate. This book is certainly capable of doing that and is a great alternative view for anyone interested in political history. It is best read with an open mind. Those with pre-formed opinions will either blindly love or hate this book depending on where their beliefs lie."
2,Embarrassing,"It is embarrassing that in a country where cures for the most insidious diseases have been discovered and where technology has grown by leaps and bounds . . . that this type of primitive, knuckle dragging fueled by blind, partisan hatred continues to exist.A poor commentary of our times."
2,"Pure entertainment- I am botoxed, so read me roar",Ok Ann. I read the book. You rant and rave in print to make your money but on the small screen you barely speak (Fox News) and your expression is so drawn out that I wonder how much of this extreme speech is not meant to bring in the cash to maintain the exact appearance that you show on the jacket cover.2 stars for entertainment. The extremists in our country only serve to keep the majority of Americans who vote focused on the real issues and for stand up comic material.Bleached out and botoxed just like the book's jacket. I would rather see Ms. Coulter do something constructive with her beliefs. Every town has a cynic. She is just making money off her cynicism while posing as a historian and critic.There was nothing new in this book.
2,Go Away,"People like Anne Coulter are the reason I vote Democrat. In four words, she is hateful, deceitful, divisive, and soul-less. There's just something wrong with her. She represents the worst and most pessimistic aspects of American politics. I made it through about the first 10 pages of this book and I had to quit. It was like drinking bleach."
5,The Left Exposed,"Ann Coulter is awesome. She gives a very convincing argument of the failings of the left. The book is a wealth of information if you need ammunition to put down those annoying liberals that you run into at the battlefields of middle america known as the cocktail party. Coulter outlines the history of the left in this country, and does it with a journalistic flair and humor that is very entertaining yet very powerful. Take that Michael Moore! This is the lefts worst nightmare, a very well reseached fact filled analysis of a failed political movement. Don't miss this entertaining and insightful book."
1,Garbage,"Please, this book is a load of garbage. If this is a representation of the Conservative Right, then we're in big trouble. This is nothing but pure hatred. Don't bother buying it, but if you must, buy it used."
1,Who Is This Retard?,Ann Coulter should look into modeling instead of writing books. She might find more success in that arena.
5,Another hit by Ann Coulter,"This book is scathing, hilarious, frightening, extremely well written and full of documented facts, the result of meticulous research on Coulter's part. Read this book before you throw the term ""McCarthyism"" into a casual conversation. Read this book before you vote in the next presidential election. Read this book, period- especially if you consider yourself an enlightened liberal. You can't dismiss this book."
4,Critics Never Seem to Refute the Thesis,"Interesting that in all the vitriolic criticism of Coulter, nobody actually refutes the thesis that takes up half this book:1. That Joseph McCarthy was absolutely correct in his assertion that there were hundreds of Communist operatives and abettors in highly sensitive areas of our government.2. That many of our highest government officials (including Presidents Roosevelt and Truman) knowingly ignored or dismissed these security risks.3. That, broadly speaking, Liberals were/are far more agitated over the inquiry itself than the risks these people posed to us.My biggest disappointment in the book is that Coulter does not do a particularly good job of explaining why the Left -- at least the American Left -- is so thoroughly and instinctively anti-American. I've never really understood that myself, and I didn't emerge from this read with the answer."
1,She is very angry,"Anne Coulter seems to me to be someone that learned very early, that hate is a great tool at rallying people behind you. That calling attention to certain people and blaming them for everything makes money. Hey, I am not some bleeding heart that says love your neighbor. However, I did wonder what the point of this book was. She expresses her anger but she does not really back it up. When she wishes to dismiss an opposing argument, she merely labels the person or group making the opposing point as ""stupid"" or ""morons."" We are not talking about literature that will be appearing in Political Science classes in the future. I don't want to be ugly, even though this book can work you up, whether you like it or not. But this just seemed to me like hanging out with someone that is angry and after awhile you either hate with her or put it down. I chose to put it down. Ahhh, life is beautiful!"
1,If you truly love your country,"and the ideals it was built upon. If you love God and plain human decendy, boycott this woman! Her rantings make the founders of this wonderful country of ours role over in their graves. Shame on her!"
2,Ludicrous and historically incorrect arguments,".If conservatives truly look to someone like Ann Coulter to be a leader in championing their positions, then conservatism is worse off than I thought it was.I've noticed many reviewers claim this is a factual accounting of the McCarthy era. You might want to strongly reconsider that.One of the main sources that Ann footnotes is Ron Radosh. He is considered one of the most reputable scholars who has studied the McCarthy era in great detail.He is apparently appalled by this book. This is what he had to say:""I am furious and upset about her book. I am reading it - she uses my stuff, Harvey Klehr and John Haynes, Allen Weinstein etc. to distort what we actually say and to make ludicrous and historically incorrect arguments.""Rather humiliating, wouldn't you say?."
1,Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.,"I read this book with horror, thankfully a friends copy, no money from my pocket supported this sad little book.The tactic seems clear. To justify the demonization of the opposition, with righteous indignation. Make the opposition afraid to opose. Scare the moderates into keeping silent. Deter honest debate and free thought.If someone disagrees with you, question their loyalty.If they are insulted and cry foul, tough. You have a right to question their patriotism, you are right.This woman is revisiting, and encouraging the employment of truly evil tactics that play to the worst part of human nature.Look back in horror at McCarthy, Wertham, Hollywood black-lists and such, and see this book for what it truly is."
1,Coulter's Wet Dream,"A college professor is seated before a congressional committee. An hysterical congresswoman wearing a black micromini asks, ""Are you, or were you, ever a member of the liberal Democratic party?""Have you no sense of decency, ma'am? Obviously not."
3,A Moderately Interesting Book,The language is a bit overblown and the charges are not always proven. Trying to revive Joe McCarthy's reputation appears a bit much.
1,COULTER LIES AND BALONEY,"Coulter is an arrogant know-it-all who skews the facts.......is on a crusade to denounce all liberals ....like Hannity.......she is a sarcastic, one sided ultra conservative who has no shame.She generalizes. She defends McCarthy?????????????She is a sick women with a sick message..........full of hate for anyone who does not hold HER views."
1,Bleach Blond Opinions,"Ann Coulter has clearly figured out that she can earn her crust by espousing unsupported and outlandish opinions to attract attention. That is once again apparent in this book. The book does have some amusement value as a cynical and bizarre fantasy, but, even so, unless you share her predispositions, you will find that most of the book is complete tripe. If you do share her predispositions, you will not be challenged by anything that this sad woman has to say. Let's hope she finds something more useful to do with her life."
1,Know Your Enemy,"Ms. Coulter debates in tones of scorn, contempt and tortured logic not seen by this reader since the book, ""Mein Kampf."" The author gives little evidence that is not tainted by her partisan prejudice against the liberal left, airing the most outlandish accusations without regard for proof or logical argument. An apparently talented attorney gone berserk with hatred that is almost comical in its vituperation if not for the deadly seriousness of the author's intent.In a country that prides itself in the freedom of expression, I welcome this outlet for the deranged and hateful propogandists of the right. I believe that most thoughtful readers will be so offended by this screed that they will rightfully conclude the source of such diatribes are wrong and unbalanced in their mind. Those drawn to this pole of the political spectrum have no use for reason and place themselves so far outside the mainstream of American discourse as to be seen for the fringe element they represent."
1,Preposterous claptrap from the Wicked Witch of the Right,"I don't know what's more absurd, that Coulter can get such a poorly researched, misrepresentative, and fabricated work published to begin with, or that so many people take this patchwork of deceit and opinion from such an obviously third-rate mind seriously. If you think this book deserves five stars, go as quickly as you can to the self-help books. And yes, I read it -- that's what libraries are for."
1,Tripe for sale or rent,"Ann Coulter, darling of the right, does not present one fact in this book, or any of her writings, for that matter. It is rife with assumptions, speculations, revisionist history and vitriole. Mostly vitriole. Name-calling and mud-slinging aren't even opinions, but simply hatred for anyone not like the vocal right. The ultimate in classism, sexism, and bigotry, I'm surprised any publisher would even consider this crap for publication. But don't go by me, you may like it."
1,McCarthy Good?,"Anyone who would try to claim that Joseph McCarthy was a good senator should be committed to an insane asylum. McCarthy was a proven liar and was proven to be a liar on TV. Apparantly Ann didn't see that and wants to rewrite history. Either that or she believes that making up rediculous stories about people in an attempt to discredit them is a good thing. Which brings us to the main point of her book and that is to tell lots of stories about how liberals are bad. I have to question the validity of what she says since a lot of these stories are extremely over the top and after a while she sounds like Joe McCarthy herself. The thing is there is really nothing in here that states Republican policies in government are correct, it is all about be critical of people who don't agree with you."
1,Ann's lost her mind,"If you thought it amazing that her last book was allowed to be billed as ""non-fiction,"" you will really cringe upon reading this one. You see, Ann has morphed her rage against liberals into fury at anyone left of George W. and Ashcroft. But she doesn't give researched examples or solid arguments -- surprise, surprise! -- but offers, instead, a hysterical screed that effectively labels more than 50% of Americans traitors. One thing is for certain, this book is not about anything but ANN, and of all the people you could read about, she's most certainly the least interesting."
5,Patriotic,"It's amazing that liberals attack Ann Coulter's book without even reading it. Liberals are tragically trapped in some kind of post-prep school snobbery and obnoxiousness. Ms. Coulter's book could not be more thoughtful, accurate or necessary. McCarthy was, to paraphrase JFK and as Venona proves, a great American and a true martyr. Give up the fantasy that the Rosenberg's were unjustly slain--they were traitors, McCarthy was a patriot and liberals continue to be wrong, dangerously wrong."
1,Open a history book people,"Please. Or at least check on these sources Ann Coulter used. You will learn that she has been force feeding you distortions, half-truths and blatant lies. I'm not talking about stuff that's open to interpretation here- I'm talking about factual errors!"
1,It boggles the mind...,"I know many people will defend her no matter what, just as many will hate her no matter what, so I'm not going to try and change anyone's mind. However, it's well documented that her books are packed with erroneous citings and distorted facts. I honestly don't know how she gets away with it. And the hateful tone? It's either a shrewd way of keeping people's attention or else the woman really is mentally unbalanced. (I'm hearing more and more people speculate about that; I mean, she actually uses the phrase ""scrawny pinko"" at one point.)Also, I've heard more than once that Coulter considers herself a real foxy babe. Think about that, look at the cover of her book, and you'll see that she's clearly existing in an alternative universe."
5,This book is a great read and extremely informative.,Ann Counlter's new book is a great read full of usefull information which has yet to see the light of day. It is refreshing to read a book that gives the reader the truth about liberals. It backs up the ideas I have always had. It is headed to #1.
1,What's next?,"""Where do you go next? Holocaust denier? Slavery defender?"" (Quoting David Brock of Coulter)."
1,I suppose she could be called an entertainer,"Isn't that the excuse Coulter, Limbaugh, and their ilk give for the barrage of bad information they publish? ""We're not journalists, we're entertainers."" Well, okay, then, it is somewhat entertaining to read Ann Coulter...or maybe stunned fascination is more like it.The mischaracterizations, misquotes, and outrigtht falsehoods that fill this book, and most of Coulter's work, are well-documented elsewhere, but I doubt her followers are the type to bother finding out."
1,Intellectual? I think not!,"To the reviewer who described Ann Coulter as an intellectual, I can only say, I think not! She is the worst kind of person in that the facts never stand in her way of her vitriolic and inaccurate blather. I listened to this on tape and I was so angry at times over the overt prevarications she uses, passing them off as facts, that it made me want to scream! The fact that she can call the invasion of Grenada a huge success (island with the population cleveland, 12 service men died due to friendly fire versus enemy fire and 8,000 medals of bravery given to only 7,000 men and Regan slept through the whole thing?)The woman needs to be slapped silly for the inflamatory prose she excretes in the name of patriotism and the American way. She is an embarassment to Democrats and Republicans alike! I am a liberal Democrat and how dare she assume that I am not a patriot! How dare anyone assume that! It is slander!"
4,"Allow me to quote one of the ""one-star"" reviewers...","""No brainer! She's Nuts!, July 5, 2003Reviewer: A reader from FL USAA human being can be this simple minded..A piece of garbage.""Please direct your attention to the post created on July 5th by this very informed and articulate reader. These are the kinds of people who give this book one star. I think that reviewer (and others just like him/her) should read very carefully what they are about to post before embaressing themselves and their entire agenda.Having said that, I give it 4 stars. I take one star away for Ann not trying to understand the other side in her writing."
1,Same old Rhetoric,This book in the long list of un achivements by Mrs. Coulter is another opinion piece not based on the truth just smear. If it were up to Mrs. Coulter and her right wing extremist cohorts we would all be back before the civil rights movement. She calls anyone who does not support W's war guilty of treason when she is guilty of smearing to further her cause.
1,Phhhbbbttt!,"You know, its not even a matter of Left VS Right politics - this really is just a shoddy piece of writing."
1,For those who see the world in black and white . . .,"Less a book than a diatribe, it is hard to understand how some people see her, or her arguments, as objective. Indeed, conservative writers Dorothy Rabinowitz and David Horowitz have criticized her for being so over the top as to give her detractors credibility in their attacks on her and her adherents.Her contribution to the further polarization and invicivility in discourse is, however, plain to see. For those who buy into her rhetoric as the gospel, there is only one just point of view, and the world is easily separated into black and white. To sum up: a childish rant for those who prefer not to delve into the nuances and complexities that make up life and history."
1,I read this one out of morbid curiosity,"What I saw was a person who knows very little about history and makes the assumption that anyone who doesn't share ANN COULTER'S morbid worldview is not only un-American, but treasonous.I suggest that anyone who actually believes her dribble also read the ""I Hate Ann Coulter....Reader."" They will see just how little truth and accuracy mean to Ann Coulter and just how warped she is.This book ranks right up there with the publications Joseph Goebbels came up with for the Reich of his boss. Thank goodness, we only have four more years of ""Das Reich"" of this second Bush."
1,The War & Peace for the Under 70 IQ,Absolutely unreadable!! One of the least coherrent and morally repugnant books ever written. You'll feel robbed if the book is sent with a 50 dollar bill taped to the cover. It would be somewhat frightening if you felt Coulter even had a shread of evidence or a modicum of intelligent thought put into this drivel but alas it's just the typical hate-filled right-wing propoganda you can get from any no mind conservative talking head these days. Buy and read at your own risk!!!
1,Another Pack of right wing lies,More of the same old fermented rhetoric from the right wing. When is America going to wake up to the absurdities of these pseudo intellectuals.
2,Rewrites history and Skips Important Events and Facts.,"How can she write about about McCarthy and not mention his campaign in 1949 on the behalf of the Nazi SS Officers convicted of war crimes in the massacre of 83 Americans in Malmedy during the battle of the bulge. The S.S. officers were sentenced to death but McCarthy claimed they were framed and set up by Americans. She also fails to mention the Voice or America investigation which proved to be an outragous waste of time and money. She blames liberals for his downfall, when infact it was President Eisenhower and a causus of G.O.P. senators including the current Presidents Grandfather, Prescott Bush, who voted to censure him along with democrats. She repeatedly uses quotes out of context and uses them to make a point that is not true. Anyone whoe reads this book should also look for themselves into what she states as fact. She is pushing an agenda not truth, using twisted evidence and name calling."
5,Flayed by Facts,"""Treason"" is a well-written, fact-checked, and fairly depressing account of the beginnings, nature, and motives of today's far-left leaning ""mainstream media"". Having made full use of information-age technology, AC's weapon is a well-honed dialectical knife that cuts without mercy into the Marxist mind of dishonesty, deceit and treachery that the left simply cannot assail with logic. Hence the detracting reviews try using the same hoary ad-hominen and straw man arguments by pointing to AC. Unlike the NYT's, her sources aren't hiding behind bushes. Read this book and decide for yourself what's been going on for the last fifty years."
1,Oh Dear!,"this woman is an absolute joke....is she for real,or do people actually think like this. treason is just loaded with so called ""fact"" but it doesnt stand up and should be placed in the ""big brother"" fiction section of the library. Old fasioned fascism with religion and a belief that america is the holy land is the main idea ann tries too convey. if your in for a laugh borrow this book."
1,who's the traitor?,"What Ann Coulter is doing in this book and others she has written is to use lies and distortions to cause Americans to hate each other, thereby weakening our country in a time of war against terrorism. What could be more traitorous than that?"
1,Utter Nonsense,"I thought that I'd enjoy this book, but Ms. Coulter doesn't make any intelligible arguments. I highly recommend not wasting the time that I did reading this book!"
1,Complete and utter fabrications....,How can Ms. Coulter sleep soundly when she and her ilk are so soundly full of hatred and bigotry? This is the most contemptuous diatribe I have ever read. This book proves why the right has no business being in any positions of power. They will destroy us all and enjoy every minute! I want my money back!
1,Stack of whack,"It seems some people will write ANYTHING to squeeze a nickle out of a republican's pudgy fingers.... this woman is certainly one of them.... I guess all those VietNam soldiers and anti-war 'hippie' heroes, both living and dead were wrong about the lies created by republican-led war-hawks exposed for thier mis-leading atrocities over all these years... especially the profits gleaned by selling such chemicals as agent Orange: a substance that to this day has the Native-born Vietnamese women still delivering mutated babies... This kind of muck makes me sick whenever I see a slick liar feebly attempting to cover up an older lie. -Little woman, please!"
5,Discredited Left,Coulter gives well-documented deatils about why the discredited Leftist Democrat party is finished. They have no ideas and all they can do is attack Conservatives and attempt to advance their cause by character assasination ( a la Hilary). I used to be a Democrat and am ashamed to say that I voted for Clinton twice. Now I see the truth of what the Republicans have been saying all along.
3,Even Facts are Subjective Now,"I find the almost-perfect (as of 11/21/10) parabola of reviews from 1 to 5 stars immensely comedic. Anyway, I read through this, and I found the only useful part to be her defense of McCarthy. I have always felt he has been inaccurately portrayed, and Coulter delivers a perfect defense for him. Otherwise, I found this book mostly mean-spirited, biased, and perhaps more importantly, pointless. As Coulter herself once wrote, being political means to be partisan, and being partisan means to believe something. And when you believe something, others who believe something else MUST be wrong. Therefore, the premise of this book, proving the Democrats wrong on policy issues, stems not from facts, but from her very own beliefs on those issues."
2,Ann was right - we are ALL guilty of treason and slander,"Ann Coulter intelligently points out in this book that we are ALL just guilty of treason and slander. Why pick on Senator Joseph McCarthy, she asks? Granted, she points out, McCarthy was evil and embarrassing. But who sanctioned him? Ann correctly points out that it was you and I. What I like about Ann is her ability to see subtleties. Whereas you or I might think, ""liberal"" or ""conservative"", Ann sees through the soundbite simplification and sees the complexities. Ann knows what a tough world it is that we live in, and that if we want to get anywhere we had best toss our silly ""liberal"" vs. ""conservative"" absolutism out the window. After all, Ann writes, paraphrasing the bible, ""let he who is free of sin cast the first stone"". ""Let's start seeing problems for what they are!!!"" Ann says, ""instead of letting our preformed hackneyed ideologies lead us to a fake truth."""
1,Funny Stuff,"I got a good laugh out of the review called ""got them liberals on the run."" I really hope that it was a sarcastic joke imitating right-wing readers of this book. Otherwise, I'm really scared to know that there are people like that in this country.As far as the book goes, it is poorly researched, and hard to identify the sources as they come in the form of endnotes, not footnotes. It will not change anyone's views, but it will push people further to the left or the right, wherever they were already."
1,Kind of mean and stupid.,"It is simple to attack what you can not comprehend. Simple to deride ""liberalism."" But I would offer that our country, founded by revolution and by liberals and some conservatives could not even imagine the (...)that Ann Spews...Don't by it, borrow it from the library or wait until it's on a sale rack if you must. Won't be long."
1,Best doorstop I ever bought!,"Once again, in a failed attempt to elavate the political discourse, ann coulter has allowed more hypocrisy to be mass marketed and sold to unsuspecting individuals. She constantly falls victim of every thing(ad hominem arguments, lies, narrowmindedness) she attacks her liberal opponents for. Just flush your 12 bucks down the toilet, it is much more entertaining than reading this book."
5,Ann Coulter:Treason,"I like Ann Coulter. I like everything about her. I like the way she looks. I like the way she sounds. I like what she says. I like how she thinks. If you like Ann Coulter, read this book; it's really good. If you don't know Ann Coulter, read this book; it's really good. If you don't like Ann Coulter you might try 'The Ultimate Pedicure and Other Sensitive Moments' by Harry Reid or 'Why I Hideout In Hawaii Instead Of Kenya' by M. Obama."
5,The Truth often hurts........,"Ann has opened the door to the mis-deeds of decades from some very important people including Popes as well as well known figures from Washington, D.C. You can research her research on the recently released Verona Papers, it will astound you. Other authors have over the years touched on the Vatican - Nazi partnership, some have written in depth about that alliance. Her book of very revealing about what is still happening today with powerful people. This is a brave and honest book - beware."
1,Dude looks like lady,She lies almost as much as our President. Book reads like fiction. Give it to your cat have it buried.
1,An Embarassed Republican,"If this book represents Republican/Conservative thoughts, opinions and ideas, we are doomed as a party. Utter nonsense and an insult to anyone with a 6th grade education in history or an ounce of common sense."
1,Hate-triots Rejoice!,"Dissent is unpatriotic. The First Amendment is for wimps. Being wrong or disagreeing with authority is treason. Oh, and Joe McCarthy was a misunderstood, good guy. What a sad, deranged person the author is. Where does she go from here, Holocaust denial?"
1,Completely Depends on your Political Views,"Whether or not you enjoy this book is purely based on your political beliefs. I'm sure if you look through the almost 2,000 reviews on this book, the star ratings are a measure of how far left or right the reviewer is."
2,Horatio Alger Meets Barbara Cartland,"The writer of ""Dragonstongue"" and ""The Sun and the Cow; The Rebirth of the Conservative Female Consciousness"" has jumped over her own literary shadow to bring her fans a historical fantasy steeped in political overtones.The story starts in 2001, when a bulemic middle aged writer asked herself a question: ""what if Joe McCarthy was right?"" This very question reverses physics, mathematics, and even fashion, to provide her with the brush to paint a new world.Join Ann on this romp through 20th century history seen through the looking glass!"
1,Harpy is thy true face,"This book is reminiscent of a root canal I once had. Except in that instance, I was allowed drugs for relief of pain. Ms. Coulter's way promises only unrelenting agony, and marathon showings of episodes of 7th Heaven.Treason is never having to say you're sorry - even if you lied your way into a war that costs thousands of lives.Treason is calling anyone who questions you a traitor.Treason is governance by insane thuggery and fascist propaganda (come on, she's an apologist for Joe McCarthy, after all!!!).Treason is apparently failing to stand and applaud a false retarded king, whose only job before 40 was to run a failed campaign for congress on his father's name and money.Treason - blonde ambition."
5,Only an American would understand,"Only an american would understand and appreciate such an author. Those in other countries can only guess what it is really like to live here and to have taken part in our history. The truth must be told and the author does so brilliantly. That is what makes libs/dems the most upset, they can't hide the truth. Those of you in other countries who read this book and don't like it, listen up. Americans don't care if you don't 'like' us, I know I don't. God's word is the foundation this country was formed from and there is no other like it on this planet. Sure, we don't do everything right and some of us are trying to change the wrongs being done. Let God be true and all men liars. God bless America. Get this book!"
1,More than the usual Coulter,"One doesn't need to be ""on the right"" to read Ann's book. Once again she's right on, but I did have some trouble reading it even though I am a writer myself (From the First Date to the Bedroom; the Single Man's Official Guide to Success with Women.) I'm sure Ann would not consider my book politically correct; but then neither is she.On the other hand, Ann has more facts at her finger tips than any current political writer today--go for it girl!Butch Mazzuca"
1,Barry Goldwater was right.,"""Conservatives these days don't know what the word means.""Joe McCarthy did more to undermine anti-communist efforts with his running roughshod over the Constitution than any so-called ""liberal"" has ever done.But to the people calling themselves conservatives these days, the Constitution is itself a treasonous document."
1,More Bitter Conservatism,"If you've had the misfortune of reading any of Coulters other right wind backed diatribes this is just more of the some rehashed blabber with a new cover. Liberals this, Democrats that. Again same story different cover.But the conservatives do like to get one of they're own to the top of any best seller list."
1,Ann come to Papa!,"I'm gonna give you a good liberal dose of hair reducing WASP repelent. You make Fairfield county look like Germany in '38. Goebbels could have used you. Rush and Sean are using you. This book is even worse than ""How to talk like a liberal (and act like a Moron) if you must!"""
1,Freedom Fighters Rock,Yeah man this war on terrorism rulez! I can't wait until it's over and there is no more terrorism; like that war on drugs.
1,i have a question...,"if Coulter's book is so factual as some of you have said, then why hasnt she sued Al Franken for calling her a liar when he proves in his book that all her references are misguiding and in most cases flat out lies? i'm sure Ms. Coulter knows that Franken would be libelous. where's the next book? perhaps reading isn't her strong point. that could be a reason for all the ""fact"" fabrication. Here's a tip for all of you: read a history book, not a joke book."
1,Treason???,"Does she even understand what this word means?? Oh, sure Liberals want Iraq to take over the US...give me a break. Meanwhile, I am watching on TV that some republican just exposed that a wife of a democratic congressman is a CIA agent. Now exposing an agent and risking national security and the life of the agent is treason...she will never mention this type of example which involves republicans. This book is a piece of garbage meant to overthrow the two party system that has made this country what it is today. Real patriots will ban this book and Ann Coulter."
1,Garbage In=Garbage Out,"When the body politic gets this Orwellian it's time to give it up. So many lies-so many people buying into it-so, so sad."
1,Pictures are the best part,"For those of you who have been waiting to see Ann in the buff, here's your chance. For those interested in text, forget it. It's an illiterate rehash of other, better neocon writers."
1,Horrible Revisionist history,"Venom and bile that portrays itself as historical analysis. Shallow research and inaccuracies make for overly harsh generalizations. While the Liberals of this country are not immune to criticism, this book is terribly slanted and misguided.Avoid."
1,A screw loose?,"This book is either a con job by Ann Coulter to come off as the vilest person on earth (and in the process help her rake in even more money, since there's no such thing as bad publicity) or she's a mentally unbalanced sociopath. I happen to think it's the latter. Her assertion that the opinions of liberals--who, unlike self-centered conservatives, are for the common good--is not only nutty but outrageous."
1,"Dishonest, appalling, and a very dull read","It's difficult to imagine the sort of person who'd support such a book. It's dishonest and appalling, and it's desperately dull."
1,Unfortunate and Wrong,"Being a moderate conservative, I started this book with moderate expectations. What I found was not only unfortunate, but wrong. Unfortunate because it inspires hatred and distrust among this country's citizens. We may not always agree, but we are supposed to get along - and through our different ideas make a better place. The author would have us at each other's throats.And wrong - just flat out wrong in twisting facts to make them seem believable, making baseless inconclusive leaps and trying to make untruths into facts. Don't take my word for it - read the editorial in today's (July 7) Wall Street Journal, a publication that has been at times seen as conservative. Does their dissent make them treasonous?Perhaps the author is not just trying to exonerate McCarthy, but pick up where he left off. Have you no shame?"
4,Pretty good some bad,"A pretty thorough review for a short book; pointing out how the Kennedys liked McCarthy. She even honestly bashes Bush a few times and even Reagan. A good read for those wanting to see the wicked tricks of the left. She does reveal some of her own liberal attitude by quoting some vulgar R rated language of other liberals, when it is not necessary."
1,Shocked,"I am shocked and sad and utterly dismayed. I cannot believe that anyone who loves history, political discourse, accuracy or democracy would admire this book. I am not saying that because I hate conservatives or because I love Hillary Clinton as some posters automatically assume, but because I love the freedom to dissent, to debate, to languish with my father discussing the ins and outs and ups and downs of 227 years of the good, the bad, and the ugly of America. I am not a traitor. I am an American....For a balanced - or at the very least, accurate - view of current American politics, I suggest Fareed Zakaria's ""The Future of Freedom,"" and a healthy dose of ""The Daily Show."""
1,Grandma from Ohio,"As I was reading this book the thought came to me that you can only be a traitor if you are from the left, but then the picture came to mind of Rumsfeld shaking hands and hugging Saddam Hussein and George Bush I and his involvement in the Iran Contra mess that in the end saw 14 of his administration (as Vice President) convicted of crimes and I thought wait a minute how can this be????? I believe 80 to 85% of the people in America are right down the middle when it comes to politics and people like Ann Coulter, who is fanatic right, is every bit as dangerous to America as the fanatic left. This book page after page, even down to the title, only showed me hatred and we can certainly do without that.......It deserves a minus 5 stars."
1,What happened to honesty and truth?,"Let's be honest and admit that I'm not a traitor to our country when I call myself a liberal, support maintaining our Constitutional rights, and demand that those rights be made available to all our citizens. And yes dammit, I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU, and proud of it! Aren't you? Everybody who values our Constitution is already a member or should get busy and join.If she'd put her efforts into doing something beneficial, I wouldn't define her as either hysterical or smugly self-serving. I'll bet she has never read The Constitution since she claims that the ACLU is leading the, ""Conspiracy"", that will destroy the U.S.A. Please show me, when does she tell the truth?Some people could better serve their country by keeping their mouths, or in this case their laptops, closed."
1,Idiocy : Conservative Treachery in Book Form,"Even more surrealistic conservative bile from the fame hungry Serpent Queen of Venom, Ann Coulter. I honestly believe this woman is insane. Mental Pygmies read at your own risk! but remember to come back to reality afterword, this is fiction."
1,There she goes again...,"In this book, Ms. Coulter has once again shown herself to be a clueless and crass political pundit; it's all over the top accusations and bashing of liberals and blaming them for all our problems...Anyway, it'd be interesting to know if she ever went to college, or rather spent her tuition money on plastic surgery."
1,Treason?,"I truly feel embarrassed and pity for any person who reads this book and believes that it is factual. Everyone who takes the time to verify, knows that Ms. Coulter tends to embellish the truth. She has every right to write her opinions but she shouldn't sell her books in the non-fiction section."
1,Book not worth all the banter,"All the discussion to do with 'Treason' is unfounded. This book was mislabelled, it was actually supposed to be in the fiction category, not non-fiction. It's a fairytale, written for chidren (pretty mean children by the tone of some of the 5 * reviews), heroes and villains (the honorable Joe McCarthy vs. all the people who's lives he ruined by getting them blacklisted), a happy ending (the simple fact that it even has an ending). It even has a witch in it (Coulter)."
1,I wish I could give this 0 stars,This book was nothing but hateful words typed on a page with no facts to back them up. I am a Republican and I am tired of my party spewing hate like this. Why is everyone so angry?
1,Scary!,"I don't really know where to begin. This book is terrifying. Not because of what Ann is claiming, but because people are buying it. Ann is at the forefront of a movement that is killing political dissent in America. Her quotes are often incorrect and taken out of context, and her fact checking is either laughable or deliberately misleading. It is irresponsible to even treat this book as nonfiction.I am at a loss as to why so many Americans are quick to embrace Coulter's apologist view of McCarthyism. I beg anyone who is considering a purchase of this book to balance out their learning with some books based on reality. At least read Brendan Nyhan's well written online retort to gain some sort of perspective."
1,Laughing all the way to the bank,"I'm surprised that anyone takes this book seriously. Well, I'm not really surprised that right wing extremists and Jerry Springer fans think it's great. She wrote this book for the money. That being the case, she would write anything that would sell. She must think all this commotion is amusing - and profitable."
1,She's psychic,"As a liberal, I'm delighted to find out that Ann Coulter knows what I think and knows how I feel about my country. Can't wait to read the book and find out more about myself. How does she do it?"
5,Mind-Boggling,"First, allow me to praise Coulter for her thorough investigation of liberal treachery since WWII. NEVER before had I even HEARD of the Venona Project, which apparently proved that McCarthy was RIGHT about Soviets in the Government. And somebody around here thinks Conservatives are rewriting history???Please.I've heard in school all my life that McCarthy was a bigot, scaremonger, and a liar. Well, i guess it might SCREW up that theory to know that McCarthy only accused people of being communist who, um...WERE communist!!! That's not bigotry, that's bravery people.But we never heard about the Venona Project, or that all those wonderful, unfairly accused Americans were SOVIETS trying to TAKE OVER OUR COUNTRY!!!!Who wants to rewrite history?Good Job Ann. Keep up the good work."
5,Gotta love it,"I thoroughly enjoyed Coulter's observations about the lack of backbone and decisiveness in liberal America, especially during war. Her arguments are backed up by historically proven facts, and feature endless quotes of liberals making fools of themselves via their favorite media forums in America. Liberals time and again prove one of Coulter's main points in the volume; when it comes down to making the case on an issue, conservatives provide facts and liberals whine."
1,Full of Lies,"How could anyone, right or left, in good faith produce this book? Coulter should be ashamed of herself."
1,RE: The Truth Hurts,Agreed. This must be why Condoleeza Rice and other Bushies are going nutty over the release of Against All Enemies by Richard Clarke.
2,Not the greatest...,"I read this book, and while Ms. Coulter makes a great show of quoting historical sources, she more or less picks and chooses her way through history --i.e. her assessment of the contribution of Senator Joseph McCarthy. That alone was abit frightening, however, I did give her an extra star because, regardless of the material and blatant bigotry and obvious rage going on inside of this person, she's actually quite a good writer. She also looks to be a very pretty girl, but she needs to relax a bit. Each written sentence seems to scream from the page, ""Ecoute moi!"" Perhaps she just needs a good hug, but the anger is so palpable. In any event, she does have a flair for writing, although I'd love to see what she could do with other subjects. She'd be an excellent fiction writer --- this book certainly dangles on that border."
2,Before You Read This,"Read David Brock's Blinded By The Right (don't let the title put you off), which is an excellent precursor to Ms. Coulter's works to the extent that it offers a telling perspective on the extent of her factual research and overall journalistic integrity."
1,What is wrong with Ann Coulter?,"I'm sorry to say that Ms. Coulter has produced another pile of mindless drivel and lies and called it a book. I'm ashamed to even say I read it. It's a pathetic and hypocritic attempt to trick readers into blindly ignoring the faults of their leaders. I didn't support the War in Iraq, but I'm certainly not a traitor and I do not hate the United States. The ability to publicly dissent is part of what makes the country so great. Ann doesn't seem to agree with the Constitution, however. For those of you thinking about buying this book, there is just one thing you need to know: a section of the book is devoted to the defense of McCarthyism! That's just plain rediculous, people. Please, do whatever you can to avoid reading this rediculous book."
1,Poorly written,"This book has been laughed at by the serious literary critics, and I can see why.It's poorly written, poorly researched and just plain wrong on almost every page. Joe McCarthy a hero? Ha ha! Writing stuff like that just to titilate people only makes Coulter look foolish."
1,Not well supported rhetoric,"As a conservative reader, I expected far more from Ann than this. She makes startling generalizations akin to the rantings of Rush Limbaugh on the right or Al Franken on the left. If you are interested in well supported and quality political opinions, you can skip this book!"
1,Brainless,"It is fashionable these days to take an outrageous thesis and present it as an entirely reasonable argument, and then to trash anyone who disagrees with that thesis as stupid or unpatriotic. This book fits that description entirely. Anyone who defends McCarthyism is either too young to remember how horrible it was or looking to make a fast buck. Here, the author is both too young and too greedy to care about McCarthyism. Instead, she has completely sold out to the establishment, declaring her love for Republican administrations and all of society's repressive institutions, including the military. Books like this are all too common these days, and it feeds into the right wing echo chamber that now passes for intellectual thought in 2003. But any perusal of this book confirms this junk for what it is. Brainless diatribe catering to an audience that wants to be told that its ignorant, ill-thought out views were right all along."
1,Unpatriotic Anti-American Neocon Rants to Fellow Neocons,"This book is basically for people who agree with Ann Coulter. It is perhaps revealing that over 50 people recommending this book on Amazon also recommend that people read Adolf Hitler's ""Mein Kaumpf."" Coulter's rant will no doubt appeal to adherents of fascism. Her premise is that anyone who disagrees with conservative foreign policy dogma is treasonous. She does not believe in the basic rights of freedom of thought and expression envisioned by our founding fathers in the US Constitution, so one wonders who is truly the traitor to the principles of the United States, ""liberals"" or Ann Coulter. Read the book, you decide. There aren't many people that put Joseph McCarthy on a pedestal, but Ann is one of them. Charming."
1,Lies,"Ann Coulter claims to have her sources backed up. But how about this? She accused Evan Thomas, a journalist for the New York Times, of being the son of 4-time socialist candidate for president Norm Thomas. It turns out that his father was really Evan Thomas, Sr. How can you get that wrong? She is totally making up everything in that entire book. Don't read it; you will corrupt your mind."
1,More dishonest drivel from a loud mouth !,Another dishonest and loud book by Ann Coulter!Coulter is obviously on someone's payroll and is clearly promoting someone else's interest. Her loud mouth and annoying voice have been well used to promote a divisive political ideology. She has been ironically launched by the corporate media as a puppet/pundit to serve the corporate agenda.Coulter's book has been well used by the Political boys'club. Her writings are an embarrassment to women everywhere on this planet.
1,Book is not worth either hating or defending,"People like this, crazy people like Coulter, say wild things, like McCarthy is a great American, to get attention and to sell books. So don't give her any. Like Morton Downey Jr., pro wrestling, or even Mr. T, it's all an act. She doesn't even believe what she is saying. And, as for the ignoramouses that like this book, well, you're being conned. It seems there is always some 'smart' Republican out there that will use your own natural intsincts to hate and feel prejudice for politics to detract from the real issues (the fact that many of you have lost your jobs and the economy is in the dumper). In this case, it's to to sell a book - and a bad one at that. While you are all grunting and groaning trying to make out the words you know in this book, the already rich Miss Coulter is sitting back and counting more of her money."
1,Ha Ha HA !,"I consider myself a independent but I have never seen anyone who twists the truth as she does. Liberals hate America? Thats the biggest load of bs I have ever heard. Whatever you do, steer clear of her and all of her books."
1,Not worth it,I don't think I need to outline my reasons for not enjoying this book. Let's just say it goes too far and makes herself look terrible and ignorant. She's the conservative version of Michael Moore.
1,Conservative treason.,"Liberal treachery? A more important issue right now is conservative treachery because GW ignored Clinton's security and intelligence recommendations and did nothing about bin Laden prior to 9/11. That's well documented. There are some very troubling questions that GW needs to answer about his Saudi connections. And what took the administration so long to investigate 9/11? And why does the report protect Saudis? How's that for treachery? More tough - and necessary - questions like that are asked in Michael Moore's book ""Dude, Where's My Country"". I suggest you pick that book up and pull your head out of ... uh ... the sand."
5,What a great read! The full gale of truth for a change!,"Ann does it again! The most courageous conservative writer of our time triumphs with this latest expose of the dangers posed by the liberal culture and mindset. Finally, someone with the gumption to trumpet the truth that most left-leaning idealogues not only aren't patriotic, but have downright contempt for America. What a perfect retort to some of the ghost-written drivel being touted as ""non-fiction"" by another notable female writer recently at the top of the best-seller lists.Go Ann go!"
1,facts,"The only treason is the treason of the person that wrote the book. Her facts as usual are screwed up. If you want the facts please read slamed by the right. Ann Coulter is mentioned manytimes by this person who was one of them. In order for this rightwing conservatives to write, they must destroy another personscharacter. They do not use facts, but character assacination.I use to be a republican, but after this group that has now takenover the republican party, I can no longer be a part of theirtype. There are good conservatives and good liberals and we bothwant the best for America!! I spent 3 years fighting a war in the South Pacific for the freedom we have. I have always foundgreat people on both sides of an issue, but I use facts not fiction. This book is truly nothing but lies and fiction."
2,more of the same,"For far-right folks, this book will most likely be an entertaining what-she-said-right-on orgy. For those with more centrist views or those of a liberal persuasion, it's better not to poke this particular hornets' nest."
1,a masterpiece of historical revisionism,"in response to Daniel Lowenberg's review: yes, indeed Ms. Coulter's book _is_ ""marvelously footnoted"" but if you took the time to actually look at the sources she cites it would soon become apparent how she twists and distorts historical facts to suit her own narrow view of the world. Does she mention McCarthy's 1949 campaign on behalf of Nazi S.S. officers who were convicted of war crimes for the massacre of American troops in the town of Malmedy during the Battle of the Bulge? No? Hmm... I wonder why?"
1,A fun read for robo-conservatives with mid level IQs.,"Coulter is fun for Republicans with IQs in the 100-120 range. She has full command of the high school debate star rhetoric, but her books cry out for genuinely learned, intelligent debunking. Ann loves to defend her work on entertainment television -- the tv news programs beloved by mid-level hobbyist thinkers -- but she could never hold her own with authentic historians, with a full command of the material she hysterically misshapes to ""make"" her ""points."" I do recommend pairing her work with the work of an even more middlebrow, even more shameless ""thinker,"" Peggy Noonan. Talk about fun blondish fascism!"
1,What is happening to our country?,"This is the new McCarthyism, period, end of story.God help us all."
5,A True American Spirit,What a GREAT book. It confirms what I always thought was true about the Liberal establishment. Increditable read. Thank goodness there are people such as Ann Coulter to pick up the banner for the conservatives against all this...coming from the liberals. What a refreshing book to read. Thank you Ann Coulter.
1,"Once again, we have nothing but a stack of lies...","In the Paperback edition of Al Franken's excellent book ""Lies And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them; A Fair And Balanced Look At The Right"", Franken talks about the time that a week after he handed in his book, he and his wife were going to gout to eat, but that she wanted to put on lipstick. So she went back to the bathroom and as she was doing her deed, he rediscovered this book in his case, but didn't ""want to torture himself with it"", so he made a bet that he could find at least one lie in every page. Sure enough, he said he did. I was thinking, ""I know Coulter is a liar, but I didn't really think she could lie on every page"". Sure enough I was wrong. She does lie on every page and uses mostly invective that would border on insane. if you were a thinking perosn, you would steer clear of this crap at all costs."
1,Drivel...,Read this rather long dissection of this distorted thesis. It's even more remarkable that there are those that would agree with her.homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/coulter.pdf
1,Manchurian Author,"Personally, I think Ann Coulter is a democrat spy.She does more damage to conservative causes than any liberal pundit could - reminds me of the early 60's movie, The Manchurian Candidate, the posited that McCarthy was a Soviet spy used to weaken US democracy.Its interesting that many thinking conservatives despise this book as much as liberals do (see Andrew Sullivan review, among others)"
5,Amazingly good...,"Not being in this country during the McCarthy era, I believed that McCarthyism was a three letter word. Of course, Fox News did not exist then, which helps explain how far leftists were able to divert people's attention from their real collaboration with the Soviets (according to declassified Kremlin documents) to attacking their accusers such as McCarthy. Thanks to Ann, the widely available truth is now in a great book and at last available to people like me who had heard only one side of the story. Very recommended!"
1,No stars,"This book is utter bs. Why are we not allowed to rate with no stars? Does Coulter deserve ""one star"" just for getting published?"
5,Makes you think,If you are closed-minded or have no sense of logic than you will be lost reading this book. Ann is amazing. I bought the audio CD and it was refreshing to have the author do the reading. This book is extremely well researched and is a great history refresher while challenging your thinking. I can't wait to have my next discussion with my liberal friends!
1,"boring, contrived, and out of touch","nice try though... i'd recommend al franken's new one, it's a lot more entertaining"
1,treason,The penalty for treason in the US is death. To say that people who have an opposing political view should be put to death is frightening but even more frightening are the people who will buy this book. Simply read the positive reviews of the book and you will understand why the US is in trouble.
1,Footnotes or endnotes?,"Supporters of Ann Coulter are crowing about the ""fact"" that all of her ""facts"" are extensively footnoted. One reviewer here even challenges us to refute just one footnote. Well, refuting them all would be much easier than refuting just one because there are so many to choose from. First of all, if you were dumb enough like me to spend money on anything by Ann Couter, then you might have realized that her ""footnotes"" are actually more like ""endnotes"" and often don't match the source. There is very little history in this book, as one reviewer has claimed, and far too much hatred. Ann Coulter is a believer and she reports the ""facts"" that support her beliefs. Diatribe does not even begin to describe this [fluff]."
5,Give it 5 stars just for the writing style,"Like my father use to say 'It's a bad day if you don't learn something new'. If you read Ann's book, aside from the factuals of it, it's a way to learn new words. Some I had to look up in the dictionary, which is a good thing. See how history can be twisted. We wonder how Islam is teaching their view of history...and here we can see how liberals have warped the preception of the Cold War and their part in it."
4,A fresh look at recent history,"From the Cold War to today, Ann Coulter makes us stop and THINK about what we KNOW and what we have been TOLD. Who are the true patriots? What makes a patriot? Is the Republican party the party of true Americans?Like or dislike her, this book forces you to reexamine your personal memories and feelings.My only criticism is her ""preachy-know-it-all"" tone. Puh-leeze Ann, you can believe you are right without being arrogant."
1,Clinically insane author,"This woman is over-the-top nuts. She's so biased and misinformed, that it's a genuine surprise that people take her work and opinions seriously."
2,"Plenty of biting humor, but woefully devoid of honesty","I confess: I'm a liberal. I am not, however, blind to the past and present sins of my party. I gave this book a read in an attempt to better understand the conservative position on issues. Unfortunately, this is not serious political discourse. This is merely fast-food for the neo-con soul, as relevant and unsatisfying as soft-core porn. She beats to death one preposterous, simple-minded premise throughout 292 pages, but her copious footnotes have been proven to be largely fictitious. Don't believe me? Just perform a simple web search for ""Ann Coulter"" and you'll see what I mean. Not to mention that her take on the McCarthy era can only be established in 20/20 hindsight: the proof in this pudding was only de-classified in 1995! ""Conservative intellectual"", indeed. This is nothing but tabloid hokum from an opportunist whose 15 minutes are just about up."
1,Not a true conservative,".A writer for The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page, Dorothy Rabinowitz, has done one of the better debunking jobs to date. She noted that the Coulter history of the Hollywood blacklist of suspected Communists ridicules the whining of prosperous exiles but ignores ""the countless people destroyed because their names had popped up on some list of alleged Communists or fellow travelers, or sounded like a name on one of those lists.""Ms. Rabinowitz also pointed out that Ms. Coulter's admiring biography of Sen. McCarthy's career ""excludes the senator's remarkable efforts on behalf of the members of the SS battle group who executed 86 American POWs in the Ardennes campaign in December 1944, otherwise known as the Malmedy Massacre."" His line was that the U.S. Army had cruelly mistreated the former SS men.Readers can thank Ms. Rabinowitz for filling in the gaps in a gap- filled book"
1,Full of Lies and misquotes by Miss Coulter,"One example:In page 37 She qoutes Haynes and Klehr's book Venona:The communist party was ""a fifth column working inside and against the United States in the Cold War""Well I happen to have the book Venona. Heres the full qoute:""To say that the CPUSA [communist party u.s.a] was nothing but a Soviet fifth column in the Cold War would be an exaggeration""This wasn't an honest mistake she intentionally misleads the reader and distorts the truth."
3,The only thing worth watching - Ric Flair,"The start of the Hogan era in WCW. Why? There are some good matches in the undercard worth watching. The Hogan/ Flair match was good, but the post celebration with Hogan is long and boring. This tape captures the beginning of WCW's downfall."
3,Disc 2 is second generation copy.,"I could make a digital copy of the Disc 1 with no problem, but could not make a digital copy of the Disc 2 because it was second generation copy prohibiting digital copy. I could make an analog copy only of the Disc 2."
5,just as it said on the box,"I was very pleased with my aquatic shoes, they came from USA therefore they worked out a little more expensive than if I had bought them in the UK. However, one cannot buy anything similar in the UK, although I believe there is a strong possibility that this will become the case in the near future. I was also knocked for custom tax which was unlucky. The shoes do just what they say would on the box. I was lucky to get the correct size and they fit well and are very comfy and supportive. What more can I say. They do the job they are intended for."
1,Aquatic Shoes,"Not well made. Had to return them. I do not recommend this shoe, especially for instructors. This shoe came apart the first time I wore it."
1,Not so great,"There are three versions of little women, and this would have to be my least favorite. the only good thing about this movie is Katherine! She gives a great preformance as the charactor, but that's the only thing that keeps this movie at being one star movie apposed to being a complete drag. I probably wouldn't actually choose to watch this moovie again. If you're are looking for a really good version, try the 1949 version with June Allyson,Mary Astor, Janet Leigh, Elizabeth Taylor, Margret O'Brien,and Peter Lawford.Or try the 1994 version with Winona Ryder, Christian Bale, and Gabriel Byrne just to name a few. Both are wonderful, and worth watching again and again."
3,cukor & hepburn would go on to better things,"katharine hepburn heads the cast in george cukors too respectful treatment of the louisa may alcott novel. a pleasant enuf way to spend a couple hours, but i wouldnt seek it out."
1,Bahhhhh!,"I don't lke the book, but this movie was worse. It is completly, outdated, to dark, the sound and picture is terrible, and the actresses remain the same over a ten year time span in the book. How can the same actress play 12 year old Amy and 22 year old Amy? The modern additions, must be better, athough I never quite had the courage to watch them."
4,This is a Good One!,"I have recently been reading this book with my daughter, so I decided to try the movie. I liked this version. The movie recounted so much of the book which was pleasant. I know some reviewers didn't like that certain things were left out of the movie, but I didn't mind. There is no way to fit everything into a movie.Katherine Hepburn was just as I imagined Jo to be except Katherine Hepburn was too old to play Jo in my opinion. The ages of the actors were the only thing that threw me off-- everyone was much older than the book! The girls were in their early teens when the book starts. In the movie, they appeared to be in their 20's and 30's and their parents were older Grandparent ages. It did not distract too much from the movie. I would recommend this movie to any Little Women fan."
3,Good Version,"Product met my expectations and arrived in a timely fashion. Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a good product. I recommend this to customers for a future purchase."
5,Katharine Hepburn is Great,one of my favorite movies. Katharine Hepburn is awsome. So is everyone eles. Lines from the actual book are included in the movie.
5,Little women,"This movie of Little Women was a very good and funny heart filled movie. Shipping from Amazon was very fast,very pleased with Movie and Amazon.Thank youJohn"
5,Huyen,"This was a wonderful movie. It was well played out. I thought it followed the book really well too. It did not leave much out which made me very happy. Jo makes this movie comes alive with her wild personality. Laury and his funny attitudes also made this movie lovable. Out of all the characters in this movie. Jo and Laury were my two favorites. I love the book and the movie too. The book was BETTER.Laury and his boyish looks, Jo and her tomboyish personality, Meg and kind works and personality, Beth and her quiet ways and Amy and her spoiled ways, all thess characters made this movie come alive with fun, laughter, warmth, kindness. It was a great movie to watch on a cold winter or snowy day. Makes you want to be a part of the kind and happy family."
5,"""Song of Daniel"" By Philip Lee Williams","A wonderfully written book about life and innocence and finding oneself. Wonderful imagery. The characters were extremely likable. It was especially interesting to me because I grew up in Athens, Georgia and visited the cemetery often, so I could really relate to the scenery set in this book."
1,Awful,"These puzzles are not logical, they are stupid. The answers in the back of the book cannot be counted on to be correct. E.g., Game 32 has an incorrect answer in the back of the book. I'm a mathematician by training. When the GRE test had an experimental test on logical thinking, I scored in the high 90's. I'm good at this kind of puzzle and enjoy doing these, but this set is awful. You might try works by Martin Gardner instead."
1,Is this even applicable in real life?,Are these puzzles even applicable in any real-life situation? It seems that instead of training the mind to think rationally they are training one to make any contextless connections.
3,2 Minutes Hate,"2 Minutes Hate is a good album but an average one for the rock genre. It does have some heavy riffs that play pretty well. The best songs, in my opinion are: ""Alligator"", ""Pilot"", and ""Understand"". The rest are good, too, but, I do not feel they hold the same grain to those three songs.This album - like the rest of their albums - are not easy to come by; I got mine at Disc Jockey (now F.Y.E.) for $1.00 USD, if I had heard of them before, I would have probably paid full price (avg. $14.95 USD).-Nam"
4,An overlooked gem of rock.,"I stumbled across this album years ago, and was delighted by the clever riffs, and rythmic sophistication. A fun, rock and roll album."
1,senses dulled beyond belief,"Sixteen year old Kaylee suffers from synesthesia, a condition that makes it difficult to trust her senses. When she sneaks into New York City, she ends up in big trouble. Not only is she being stalked by a jerk who wants to rob her, but she is trapped in the middle of the decades worst blackout. She meets Ramon, a sloppy, sarcastic dude, in an elevator seconds before the power goes out. It is thanks to him that she is free instead of trapped. With only seven hours to get home before her father, Kaylee has no choice but to follow Ramon. As they wander through the powerless city, they pick up his little sister Rosa, a saucy violin prodigy. Can Kaylee and Ramon make it home, keep everyone safe, and fall in love before Kaylee's dad gets home?"
2,Video Now and Accessories,We purchased this item for our 7 year old daughter and 9 year old son for Christmas. Within the first few weeks the batteries were dead. They liked it at first but have not even asked to change the batteries since. We bought 8 different disks to go with it. It really does not hold their interest they get tired of watching all the same shows.
1,Terrible!,"This toy is terrible! I bought one and a few hours after it didn't work! Plus the picture isn't even that good like they advertise! This toy, I mean piece of trash dosen't even deserve one star!"
1,Great idea! Broke after 3 days!!,"We had the Playskol Video Now and the regular Video Now Color from last Christmas. After the Playskol one was put through the ringer by my 3 year old, we needed to replace it. We ended up purchasing the new Video Now. It was actually cheaper at Wal-Mart than the Playskol one. Anyway, the screen is better, the sound is better and the picture is better. The flip screen is pretty neat too. HOWEVER, it seems like it is made cheaply and that was very clear when after having it for less than 1 week it died!!! We tried new batteries and even the adapter, and it just does nothing! It's going back to the store tomorrow!! I'd beware of this product, which is really a shame, because my kids loved using it at bedtime to fall asleep!!"
1,well.....,Well... I bought this item today and before I bought it I looked at the reveiw on this item and saw it had a 1 star rating and the kid said it was bad and it didn't work... I thought he had just a defective one or that he was careless and broke it... but he was right!!!!!! The Video Now xp is junk! Mine isn't working either! I just took it out of the package turned it on and like the other kid said I got sound but no picture! So doun't buy it!!! This thing is going back to the store first thing in the morning!!!!
