3,lonely hearts,It was a gripping tale of people who want to find love at any cost even if they die for it.
2,"Watch ""The Honeymoon Killers"" instead!!!","Like DePalma's crapola royale ""Black Dahlia"", LH suffers from too much gloss and not enough story. Every minute I spent with this tripe made me appreciate ""The Honeymoon Killers"" that much more."
3,It was o.k.,I was slightly disappointed with John Travolta's performance I was expecting more from him but he never came across. There where too many dead spots in this movie. Salma Hayek did very well as a psychopath but the film as a whole was sometimes very slow at spots and it performers where only decent for the most part.
4,Book Report Due Monday,I'm continually amazed by the criticisms I find of books here at Amazon from people who have clearly not read them. This feature is of absolutely no use to me. Amazon would do better to post links to articles with critiques (good and bad) by people in the media of whom we can at least have a reasonable expectation of having actually taken the time to read the book upon which they are commenting.
1,Global Warming for the uneducated,I think books like this are dangerous and to those who insist we ignore global warming problems I just want to ask you to answer this one question: What if we continue to ignore this crisis and you are wrong. What then ???? If we do indeed choose to continue to ignore these issues and you happen to be wrong then it will be too late to do anything about them. As a result we all need to do our part and play the safe side which is to assume there is a big global warming problem and do what we can to protect the environment at any cost as we only have one environment people and noone should have the power to dictate that we ignore this crisis.
1,Straight from ExxonMobile,You really only need to look at the author's affiliation to gain insight into this book. ExxonMobile (among other energy companies and Big Tobacco) fund the Competitive Enterprise Institute. With this information in mind you view this work with strict skepticism.
2,Someone needs a fact checker,"You don't have to go much further than the jacket of this ""myth"" busting manifesto to know that the authors must have had other agendas when they wrote it. The first mind boggling bullet point states that,""Myth: Solar- and wind-powered generators are a renewable, efficient, and less intrusive alternative to gas-, oil-, and coal-burning generators.Fact: Global fossil fuel supplies are in no near-term danger of being depleted, and a single 555-megawatt natural gas power plant produces more electricity than 13,000 windmills""That actual fact is that commercial wind turbines today produce between 1.5 and 3 megawatts each. You don't need 13,000 windmills, you only need around 300. It's rather easy to go to GE's Wind Energy website and find this out. One is forced to conclude that If the authors can't get their first fact anywhere close to reality, why would you trust the contents inside?"
4,Unacceptable!,"I have been reading up on global warming, pro, con and other. Though this book is slight and warming is but one topic, I have discovered its real flaw (one that applies to this and many similar books) - its conclusions are unacceptable. Not that they are arguable, provable, true, untrue, but rather they are unacceptable to the correct thinking folks who just love the idea of ""crisis!"" Everything is a ""crisis"" and I conclude that ""Global Warming - the Crisis!"" is largely, not exclusively, that.Huge ice ages, warming trends, weather shifts, desertification and extinctions all occurred long before we climbed down out of the trees. Our contribution is miniscule and that is the fact. Sorry, no major funding for the ""crisis"" mongers."
1,The Ostrich Strategy,"The name of the publisher of this book ""Competetive Enterprise Institute"" tells you pretty much all you need to know about the agenda behind this book. It's nothing more than a collection of weak attempts by corporate sponsored researchers to discredit environmental issues that the energy, logging, and agricultural industries feel threatened by.The theme of this book can be summarized as: ""Don't pay any attention to the environment. Trust Corporate America and everything will be OK.""For those who already agree with the radical anti-environmental agenda of this group, this book will reinforce their views. For everyone else, it's a waste of time."
1,This Book is Total Nonsense,I highly recommend this book to anybody who wishes to continue to ignore the pollution and destruction of our environment and not feel any guilt. The basic message of the author is: continue to be greedy consumers blindly led by American Corporations. There are huge flaws in Bailey's argument and logic. It is especially sad to me that this book is the bestseller in the environmental section: it just emphasizes the greed of Americans.
4,I read it too,"I read this book with an open mind. Like most people I have been brainwashed over the years about global warming and the environmental crisis. This book was quite the eye opener.I wish I coujld have given it 5 stars to combat all the negative reviews by those who have never even seen a copy, but I thought ""The Satanic Gasses"" gave a better perspective on the psuedoscience surrounding the issue.This is better if you are looking for some good talking points on the issue.The book is well referenced and no one should have any trouble checking out the sources. I felt the book let enough to your own imagination where the reader could form their own opinions.It is an easy read without too many deep technical discussions to spare those poor unfortunate victims of public education from having to think too hard. But then most of them would never be caught dead reading a book like his."
2,Discredited by its own Editor,"The book's editor, Ronald Bailey, came out on Sept 22, 2006 in ReasonOnline to explain that the global warming conclusions in his own book are false. According to Mr. Bailey:""In 2002 came Global Warming and Other Eco-Myths (Prima Publishing). The global warming contributor was University of Alabama at Huntsville climatologist John Christy.... In August 2005, Science magazine published [findings] that Christy and Spencer had failed to take proper account of satellite drift, which produced a spurious cooling trend to their dataset....""On the day that the studies were released I wrote a column for Reason in which I declared that my skepticism of man-made global warming was at an end.""Rather than debunking eco-myths, this book perpetuates them. Ouch."
1,Radicals!,Hmmm...A panel of UN scientists has already warned low-lying nations about the dangers of global warming. Even the Bush Administration mentioned it this year -- a first for the executive branch.UN and George Bush fear mongering radicals?Only if you also believe in black helicopters.
1,"based on an agenda, not science",Bailey's credentials are as flimsy as the facts behind this ridiculous volume.Anyone who thinks improving the environment for future generations is a political issue deserves to waste money on this book.
3,Extroidinarily Average,"I have not read this book but I find its conclussions confusing and reasonable. As a radical moderate myself I think the over arching theme of this book is important to the well being of mankind and ant farms everywhere. In no time in the past has it been like this because that was then and this is now. In the future it will be different, yet the same. Perhaps through the thoughtful critiques others have given this book in the past we can all arrive at the same destination: An Environmental Friendly McDonald's!Would you like non-beef 0 nutrition celery fries with that dolphin safe, tofu McTuna?"
2,Looks can be deceiving,"While I love the look of this baby carriage, I was very disappointed in it's size. It would be helpful to list the dimensions. I ended up ordering a larger one from a different company which was perfect."
2,Baby Carriage cookie cutter,It was disappointing to receive the cookie cutter and it was different from the one pictured. The top part of the carriage is wavy instead of straight.
3,Nice Easy Listening,"Maria Creuza has a beautiful voice, and great diction. This recording has a nice acoustic quality to it. The songs are very mellow. Recorded in 1988.I was hoping to get the version of ""Da Cor Do Pecado"" that was on the Telenovela of the same name. This recording does not contain that version!"
2,Disappointment,"The book starts with interestinig beginning plot lines; butafter the death of a possible central figure the main character'sstory begins to unravel, lose its focus and wander about until itbegins to sound like a fictional nervous breakdown."
4,"The godly, the bad and the ugly",A good book about people fighting for the right and defending the weak. I like the growth the characters are going through. The friendship of the main characters is well written.
5,Sleeper of the Year,I gave this album to one of my friends and it almost convinced him to forsake all other hip hop genre's and start listening to Christian Hip Hop. Solus Christus was the best album of the year and is still hot!
2,Larry,I was disappointed in this book. It doesn't really address the elements of writing that I had hoped that it would based on the title.
5,Better than 5 stars!,"I've been a professional editor (books and magazines) for more than 20 years, and Theodore Bernstein's book remains my hands-down favorite reference. The information is comprehensive, the explanations are crystal-clear AND often humorous, and the organization makes the book extremely easy to use. It has never failed me -- I turn to it for both my own questions and my co-workers' questions, and it always provides an answer. It's even fun to read!This book belongs on every writer's and editor's bookshelf."
2,Hummingbirds,These are pretty and all but you cant clean them. The bottle brush wont fit and you cant get to where its dirty.
3,Glassy feeder,"The feeder is very pretty and looks nice hanging outside. No takers yet however. It is hard to get the thing full as when you turn it upside right after attaching the bottom, about half of the food flows to the bottom. A bit messy when filling."
3,"I like it, but the birds don't","Its pretty, I love the color of the flowers and leaves, but the hummingbirds do not like it.They avoid it like the plague. It was a little difficult taking it apart to put the hummingbird fluid inside. Wish I could return it, but I tore up the carton it was shipped in."
4,Better than it was given credit for.,I thought this film was good. Clive and Angelina give strong performances and the ending was unpredicted. I liked the fact the Owen's character shows his constant frustration. Maybe it is because I have been to Africa and see what some of this looks like firsthand. The message about landmines was compelling as well.
3,Beyond Borders,"""Beyond Borders"" earns three stars because I feel the film's acting as well as its cause to which it's dedicated is its advantages. The movie is dedicated to relief workers and the millions of humans who are victims of war and persecution. This cause is a positive aim. However I feel it took a different direction when the movie seemed to focus more on the attraction and allurement between two of the main characters; Sarah Jordan played by Academy Award winning actress Angelina Jolie, and Nick Callahan played by actor Clive Owen. This is where ""Beyond Borders"" disappointed me and lost its appeal."
2,Interesting,"The movie was ok. I wouldn't see it again. I did not like the ending at all. Goodl luck, too."
2,Worldly and Depressing,"Movies are supposed to move you. However, Beyond Borders did not do that at all. It was like watching the evening news with a little romance added in. The romantic resonance that centered around Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen's characters appeared detached and incomplete as a result of the conflicting plotlines. There was too much going on, and it looked like the filmmakers were trying to make two films in one. If the movie was attempting to be another English Patient, but with late twentieth to twenty-first century issues, it failed.The most memorable aspect of the film was the attempt at presenting issues that have occurred or are occurring within the eastern borders both in the pacific and the baltic or in between. It had been unfortunate that the climax of the film ended with the loss of one of the major characters. However, it leaves you thinking why one of the lovers survived. There's no happy ending here."
3,DVD Beyond Borders,"The movie arrived promptly and in excellent condition.I was unaware that there would be no cover for it, that was a bit disappointing."
4,beyond borders,"The main reason I watched this was to see Clive Owen. It was a pretty good movie actually. I'm not a fan of Angelina's really, but she did a pretty good job here. My advice, if you're a fan of either of these actors, you should watch and you should enjoy it."
4,Schock film!,"This movie is deeply bitter. It's touchimg and it deals with a premise that we forget too many times , inmersed as we are in our daily activities.In a beautiful wedding a doctor will suddenly appear and will denounces the injustice for having denied them an important amount of money for the homeless and poor people from Africa.This breakthrough will twist the life of Sarah Jordan (Angelina Jolie) and she will become the most exhaustive fighter for this noble cause.Campbell makes a good and haunting movie , even there are some irrelevant scenes , but you never miss the interest in the story . Obviously this world of injustice will generate the unavoidable atraction between them .Jolie gives a very realistic portrait.The rest of the story runs for you .Interesting story , above the average ."
4,A very moving picture.,"Before I say my praises, I will advise for anyone who enjoys not having their movie spoiled, not to read a review by BANANAGURL, who totally spoils it by giving away the ending!Anyways, I found this to be more of a heart moving, touching movie, than a love story with a war/refugee backdrop. It made me realise and appreciate all that I have in my life. The warmth, safety, food and cleanliess, that 50 million people, such as those portrayed in the movie lack.This wasnt a boring, draggin-on movie, but a moving drama, that really shows the raw and deep pain of human suffering that goes on, out of peoples minds and awarenss. Hunger and pain, spreads through those people like a great colossos of doom. Great perforamnce from Angelina, and Cliwe. I'm very glad I got a chance to experience this visually moving project."
2,Please enter a title for your review,A story that has particular relevence to real people in the real world makes it's leading man such a fake action hero and expects his attitude to not detract from the realism of the situations and even expects you to like him. Whatever romance is supposed to be seen in the mutual martyrdom of the couple is hard to find given the two do not appear to have made each other happy even for a second of the film's duration and even when the dude makes his declaration of love speech he expresses no warmth. It also seems like the kind of movie that's gone through so many rewrites and re-edits than even the people working on it have no idea what it's supposed to be anymore.
2,A Tale In Two Minds,"The border in this film which is beyond belief is that of credibilty. The drama's tone is disturbingly melodramatic with the Relief Doctor's appearance at a high society fund-raising ball in London. We can accept this though, given the painful urgency of his message. But when Jolie quits her poor husband to Ethiopia in pursuit of responding to well-intended empathy for the war and famine stricken camps, the balance of the film gets crazily out of whack, and never recovers. It's not to say that romantic love has no place in such dire life circumstances. More, the film makes this point above the far more expressive needs of the people who the aid workers are there to service. Quite addled really, and undrermining all other high-minded and serious utterances made by the lead actors. In Ethiopa, in particular, this seemed in errant taste. The conceptual work is at the root of this."
4,Very Compelling!,"""Beyond Borders"" spans three war-torn, third-world countries. This is a five-star movie in my opinion simply because you leave wondering how you can help. The love story is not the focus of the movie. It is simply used to connect the settings. The focus of the movie is the men, women and children displaced by war and famine across the world. It is an attempt to spotlight an issue that most of us do not think about, but which we should. You leave the movie feeling lucky that you have a home and food, and wonder how you can help those who are less fortunate. Scenery is breathtaking. The humanitarian effort is valiant and endearing. Deeply moving and inspiring. This movie is a very well-crafted, well-directed, and well-acted wake-up call, a valuable education, and good story. I find it difficult to understand how some people could watch this movie and not be moved. Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen were fantastic. Great job! This film is one of a kind."
4,It changed my life!,"I LOVED IT! The message was GREAT! Dedicate your life to helping the poor and starving people in the World. I think that is the best use of movie media we could ever hope for. Yeah, I know it's all about ""entertainment"". Well that's not going to do much for making the world a better place. This movie changed my life. They were like to ""soul mates"" who had found their purpose in life to an extent most of only wish for. One was a doctor trying to saves the lives of starving refugees and the other was working to bring them food and supplies to keep them alive. What an awesome team!! The only thing I didn't like was the foul language. It seemed like they really over did it. I rented a ""cleanedup"" version from ""cleanfilms.com"". Without the language. I loved the ""heart"" of the movie so much I bought the orginal from Amazon. It was harder to watch with the constant foul language. I liked the cleaned up version MUCH better. But WELL worth having!! Don't listen to the critics."
3,Solid Effort; Years of Living Dangerously,"I hate bleeding-heart melodramas set in third-world countries starring Hollywood beauty-queens, BUT this one has a lot going for it. Amazingly, the dialog is good and the set-up works. The doctor has all the same objections to the do-gooders that any cynic might have, so one feels relieved of the duty of finding fault with the rich, guilt-ridden Jolie character who heads off to Africa with a truck-load of goodies. It is a brutal bit of realistic footage - those starving babies aren't actors! The film has a bit of honor and may even have done some good, although I doubt it. Still, it is a worthy piece of agitprop theatre, just the kind of thing you'd expect Miss Jolie to be part of, but here she pulls it off with flair."
3,Film Fueled Political Passion..,"Although many will look at this film and feel that ""Angelina Jolie's polital agenda totally fueled this film"", the truth is that this film was released more than a few years after it was made.. and this is the film that fueled Angelina's charitable passion.As a love story this movie is all over the map. As a political thriller, it's heart is clearly in the right place. But, after having travelled so extensively to help others.. I wonder if she could do this film the same way again, knowing what she knows now about what's TRULY NEEDED in helping others.Some kind of way, the silly love story seems trivial and unnecessary in the midst of such senseless suffering.. And, in the end the way the love story and politics offset each other.... the beauty of the leads interracting.. somehow ends up being the decadent dessert that you don't get to savor until you've choked down the vitamin rich vegetables of the souls true main course..."
3,Would be better if the film was more focused,"From it's troubled pre-production to it's schizophrenic storytelling, Beyond Borders has loads of promise but ultimately fails to deliver. Angelina Jolie plays an American woman living an unhappy marriage in London when she is drawn into humanitarian aid in various political hot spots by a very passionate doctor (Clive Owen, replacing original star Kevin Costner). The two end up having an affair (naturally) while helping out those in need, but the film's schizophrenic storytelling and lack of focus on one subject is where the film loses steam. The performances by Jolie and Owen are excellent and make the film worth watching, but the overly long running time and disappointing direction by Martin Campbell (Goldeneye, Mask of Zorro) ultimately drag the film along. Had Oliver Stone directed as he was originally set to, Beyond Borders could have been something special. It's still worth watching, just don't go in to it with high expectations."
4,Too much cussing,"If this movie didn't have so much cussing, it would be better. The actual plot is good, and given the number of hotspots in the world today, it is a perpetually timely story. I would have to say that it was a very sad movie, but one which is necessary to give us a glimpse of the horrors of life for many people in war-torn countries. Angelina and Clive were certainly passionate about their roles, which made this film believable."
4,Very Enjoyable Romantic Movie,"The storyline of this movie certainly is not very original. It has probably been done in dozens of romance novels. That being said, however, I still found this film to be very entertaining. I must disagree with some of the other reviewers that said Ms Jolie was miscast. I thought she was very good, and the type of woman I could see the male lead falling in love with. Which brings me to Clive Owen who plays the doctor and main male character. He is wonderful in this movie. His acting is super, and he is very sexy, yet believable. I couldn't detect one false move. His performance is the highlight of this movie."
5,"""Why I Chose You"" Gregory E. Lang","Powerful, emotional, exceptionally well done. A perfect gift for anyone who has adopted a child and beautiful reading for the extended family. It captures the almost indescribable feelings that unite a parent and child and will, at some point, be a valuable tool in expressing those feelings to the child."
3,i guess not what i expected,"it's really a book about all the different reasons that different people choose adoption. many of them don't apply to why WE chose to adopt. so i'm not as excited to read it to my kids. i'll keep it in our library, but probably won't pull it out very often."
1,Why I Chose You Review,The book Why I Chose You was a disappointment for me. It's just okay. I expected some short adoption stories. Instead the book just lists simple sentences that express reasons for adopting along with an accompanying photo of an adopted child and his family. The book lacks substance. I don't recommend it.
3,"Great words, not so great pictures",This book has beautiful wording however the pictures are primarily of straight white parents. Unfortunatley the photos spoke much louder than the words with a message I don't want to send my children. Many Many adoptive parents are NOT straight and NOT white!
5,Nice,These chimes have a very nice sound. They came ready to hang right out of the box. We are enjoying the music everyday.
4,Relaxing,"These chimes have beautiful tone and rings to them. The bigger the better. Only reason I gave 4 star was for the lack of a nicer hanging mechanism. Instead of having a solid metal ring or hook for hanging, it's just the end of the rope itself pressure squeezed by a aluminum piece. And that small aluminum piece holds the entire weight of the chime.It's holding so far but I would have preferred something more secure and solid. That method of terminating the ropes also makes it not quite even when hanged.BUT IT SOUNDS GREAT!!! :-)"
5,Sweet memories,I gave this wind chime as a memorial gift. My friend hung it on her patio and she said it reminds her of father every time the wind blows. Both of them loved music and she said it is the most beautiful gift she could have gotten. Flowers die but this is a gift that keeps the memories of her father alive.PM
5,Beautiful,I bought these chimes for my wife based on a sound clip that she loved. Until you hear these in person though any sound file will not do them justice. They seem to resonate forever. I hope the neighbors don't mind because I plan to get the full Windsinger series someday.
2,The Garnet Earrings,The stones were smaller than appeared in the picture of them. Otherwise they are very nice.
2,"Good information, but monotone","As a French teacher, I bought this to supplement some of the descriptions of Versailles in our high school textbook. It is quite informative, IF you can stay awake during it. The narration is monotone and I watched as my usually attentive class fell asleep. It does have moments that elicited some reactions and raised some heads (""nobles would find dark corners and staircases in which to relieve themselves as toilets were scarce"" or ""servants would scratch at the door with a pinky finger rather than knock""). These little tidbits were things that they remembered and referred back to over the year, but as to the main ideas of the documentary, those were mostly lost amidst the snores."
1,"A little sizzle, but no steak","Like those jerks who go mountain climbing before a snowstorm, this author went exploring in Burma in 1950 despite everyone's warnings. Hitching rides on broken down trucks, sleeping on bug infested floors, boarding trains that were expected to break down or be attacked, he somehow survived to tell about it. Some of his descriptions were well written, but I came away knowing more about his bad choices than about Burma. My time would have been better spent watching ""Lonely Planet.""'"
2,Hockey puck,You can't see it in the pictures but this watch is something like 1/2 inch thick!That and the fact that is has a weak strap and this watch found it's way to the trash can in 3 months.My two-year old son missed the the beeping the buttons produced but I was happy to be rid of this albatros!
3,Buy new screws,"I am still in the process of putting this gate up. I live in an older farm home and unfortunately the top of the steps are not even. The pattern didn't work and I need to re-align the gate to make it work. I was surprised that when receiving the gate it had rust marks on it. I am hoping with some cleaner it will clean up. It is not bad, but it is brand new!!! Also, I had 3 of the 8 wood screws heads break off while trying to put them on with my small hand drill. I was surprised they would break off that easily!!! I went to a local hardware store and purchased new ones. Alot of the reviews were correct in saying that you need to read directions first!!! I consider myself ""handy"", but you really need to read the directions and look at the pictures carefully. Once I have this gate on I will probably be happy with it, but the couple problems which I have encountered are very surprising!"
4,Secure mounting gate,"This gate mounted easily and is very secure when closed. Simple, does the job of keeping the kids in the play area."
1,"bought 2 of these, and both broke within 3 months!","I have a daycare in my home and bought 2 of these gates to cover both stairways. Within 3 months, both were broken beyond repair. The metal is great, but the plastic peices that hold the metal to the wall are WEAK and broke on me TWICE! Once was when a parent pulled the gate closed- apparently too hard... the other was when my 20-month-old son tried to pull the gate open. Come on, he's a baby and exactly who these gates are designed for! He shouldn't be able to break it. Luckily he got scared and cried instead of taking a tumble down the stairs. Don't buy this gate!"
4,"Overprotective father in Orland Park, IL","I thought that the installation was a little tricky because it was unclear as to how the gate would open. Also, since I was mounting the gate on a bannister and a wall, it was a little difficult to line up. I think I got lucky when I measured and used the two paper strips included with the assembly. Anyhow, the gate is up, it looks nice and I am going to sleep a little better. I think the company should include two wall anchors and two longer screws for stair assemblies. Just a suggestion."
3,Safe but difficult to install just right,"We purchased this gate because it was rated safest for the top of stairs. It was very difficult to get the mounting pieces installed properly because the directions were lacking, the templates weren't spot on, and the tool included was not strong enough. We find it a bit difficult to open but hope adjustments (in addition to the three times we've installed it already) will help correct this problem."
1,NOT 30.5 inches!!!!!!!!,"THIS GATE IS NOT 30 1/2 INCHES TALL. It is not even 29 inches. Maybe if you include the mounted mechanisms, it is. We have to raise the gate to mount onto our banisters. When we raised it just high enough to mount, there is enough space for a little one to squeeze through. If you need the height, don't buy this gate!!!!!!"
3,Sturdy But Difficult To Open,"I purchased this gate because I needed something sturdy for the two stairwells in my home. They weren't very easy to install. We needed to buy longer screws and one of the holes didn't match up so we needed to drill a hole through the steel gate. Now that they're up, I'm satisfied that I purchased a pair of VERY sturdy gates. However, I am very DISAPPOINTED in regard to how difficult this gate is to open with one hand. The mechanism to open the gate is somewhat difficult - especially when you're holding a 20 pound baby at the top of a stairwell! But, since they were too tough to install in the first place, we're keeping them up and I'll just have to work on my ""opening technique while carrying a baby""."
1,WARNING!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!,-5 STARS!!!I CANNOT WARN YOU ENOUGH ABOUT NOT BUYING THIS GATE!!!!! IT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE GATES ON THE MARKET. THE INSTRUCTIONS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO INSTALL. THE GATE WILL NOT OPEN AND CLOSE SMOOTHLY- OR EVEN WITH ONE HAND. THE SPRING PIECE ON THE HINGE COMES FLYING OFF PERIODICALLY WHEN YOU TRY TO OPEN IT.ONLY BUY THIS GATE IF YOU WANT TO SPEND FOREVER ON INSTALLATION ONLY TO BE LEFT WITH GAPING HOLES IN YOUR WALL!!!!!!!
5,Wonderful Gate!,We bought this gate after our 9 month old became mobile. I've operated other gates at friend's houses and this is by far the easiest to open. Our son loves to stand next to it and shake it so thankfully it is VERY sturdy (we mounted it to a stud on one side and wood on the other). The screws provided were not long enough to put into drywall so it necessitated a trip to the hardware store but it was worth it. The only negative we have found so far were the horrible installation instructions. We bought an extension with the gate as our opening was too wide which made it all the more confusing. It took a little time but once we figured out the instructions it was smooth sailing. We definitely recommend this gate!
1,DON'T BUY THIS GATE ...IT CUT MY SONS HEAD,"My 15 month old was walking around the gate with my mom to go down the stairs and the bolt part of the locking mechanism cut and bruised his forehead. The locking mechanism consists of two bolts that screw into the top and bottom of the gate...then snap into plastic pieces(one on top and the other on bottom) that are fixed to the wall. Shame on this company for manufacturing someting so dangerous. I notified the company and they made me feel as if it were entirely my fault. They are going to refund my money, however, I don't want to see this happen to anyone else, especially a small child."
1,Don't buy this gate!,"It took over an hour for my husband to install this gate. As soon as I tried it out, I made him take it back down. It was very difficult to open and close, and since we're using it at the top of the stairs, it was not acceptable. It can best be described as ""difficult to use, loud, and clunky"". We purchased the Simple and Secure gate by the First Years the next day, and we LOVE it. It is the complete opposite of the Safeway gate."
2,SOMETIMES IT PAYS TO SHOP AROUND....,WE NEEDED SAFETY GATES FOR OUR NEW HOME...MY WIFE PURCHASED 5 OF THESE GATES FROM BABY'S R US FOR 64.99.....CONSUMER REPORTS #1 RATED SAFETY GATE....A FEW DAYS LATER WE WENT TO IKEA AND FOUND THE SAME EXACT GATE WAS 19.99...IKEA CALLS THEM PATRULL FAST....THE SAME EXACT GATE FOR ONE THIRD THE PRICE....
2,Terrible Instructions,"I'm going to disagree with thsoe below who found this easy to install. I am fairly handy but I found the instructions and engineering absolutely appalling. Don't know if any other brands are better but if you are a busy parent who doesn't need another project, look elserwhere.Once up it works. It's just a gate. It should. It's not the space shuttle."
1,This gate is a piece of junk.,"This gate deserves zero stars. This is a very heavy iron gate, which is good - the problem is that the hinges & other hardware supplied by the mfgr are totally inadequate to attach the gate securely to the wall. I have two in my house (I live in a three story home). The hinges are just plastic and one set broke upon installation. Also, both gates have come out of the wall twice. My sheetrock cracked when I tried to put one of the gates back up. Do yourself a favor, don't buy it."
3,Review of Braund's Lucan,"Braund is painfully literal, which may her translation great as an aid to my reading of the Latin text, but made the translation itself a bit unexciting. The trouble with Lucan, in my view, is that so many of his richest moments are also incredibly subtle. There's also no way to deny that it's difficult--very difficult--to render the geographical/astronomical/sophistic passages interesting to modern English readers.Braund had a great set of notes at the end, too. (I wish these were footnotes, but beggars can't be choosers. There aren't many editions of English Lucan in print.)"
3,Natural booming,I liked his research on the ethological movement. If you are interested in psychology and this kind of research/studies...this is a good read
4,Shiva PaintStiks,"I ordered the paintstiks with the intent to use them for quilting art. They are fantastic - so easy to use, and they add great highlights to the fabric I use for quilting art"
1,another waste of money for parents who NEED everything,"Why spend the money? Only neccessary if you are feeding over carpet. Vinyl floor wipes well. Go to the dollar store and spen a buck on a large vinyl tablecloth or shower curtain. Chose your color, size, style, etc. and only spend a buck. These are usually much bigger than the splat mats and work just as well. Can match your tablecloth or home decor if you wish. Just eye candy in the store, you really do not need everything they sell. Save the cash for important items."
2,So so,"The colors are nice and it wipes clean, but it's just not big enough. Most kids will miss the mat when they toss a spoon or a dish. I can use it later to protect my dining table from crayon marks when she get big enough to sit a color, so there are alternate uses."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY BUY A TABLE CLOTH,"I recently purchased a splat mat for my 11 month old son. I brought it home and realized that it was much too small. Also, the material was very flimsy. Here's what I did. I returned the mat the very next day. Then I headed over to [another store] and purchased a circular vinyl table cloth. It only cost me [$] and it works great! It covers a larger area to protect my tile against the inevitable spills. It's heavier so it doesn't bunch up when my son's high chair gets moved around. Finally, I was able to find a pattern that went with the decor in my kitchen."
2,Disappointing book by Carol O'Connell,"This book does not come close to my other favorite CarolO'Connell books such as Killing Critics, The Man Who Cast Two Shadows. Very disappointed. Hope the next book is better."
2,The stone angel was porly written,This was a poor attempt at any kind of writting. I was upset that they used the same title as the great margaret lawarance. it made me quite upset. the book was overly poor and i was quite disappointed.
3,All right,"It was all right but could have been better. Too much Charles, not enough Mallory and I think a little more of her past relationship with her mother and may be a hint of a future story about who her father is. In my opinion it could have been much better."
5,"Mallory is an intriguing, original and disturbing creation","Against a richly realised Southern Gothic background, a strange and exotic story works itself out. By the end of this novel, I was breathless with excitement, moved almost to tears by Mallory's tragedy and the damage that has resulted from it, and emotionally drained. You won't read another crime novel quite like this all year."
3,Reader,The main character was not developed in depth. The book was too long: too much inane description; not enough important description.
2,Overly Contrived,"I read Mallory's Oracle and, though I thought it was a disappointment in some minor ways, it was sufficiently well-written and spell-binding for me to hope future books would improve on the premise. Stone Angel, however, was a HUGE disappointment. I was so irritated by the time I got to the end that I didn't care who murdered whom."
4,User-Friendly,"I found this volume incredibly user-friendly, easy to read, and the layout well-organized. It focuses on the moon as well as the sun in formulating astrological relationships. I highly recommend it for those who wish to get their synastry feet wet."
1,"Take my brain, please!","Oh man is this bad.For what it's worth, here's the plot;To land a ship on Mars you need one smart computer. Unfortunately, there are none around. Soon to be pushing up daisies Colonel Barham however, donates his brain to science and viola, we have a smart computer. Unfortunatly, his wife glances at Barham's friend for a nano-second and the brain goes bonkers.Gifted with super-human powers to annoy, the brain gets a god complex. And the general in charge of the project finally puts the audience at ease by putting a bullet through the brain. Everything explodes for some reason (encased in gasoline I suppose) and we fade to the credits.It would be hard to find a level this episode works at. It's a rather obvious 'Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde' takeoff, although the still human Barham is rather off his rocker. There's basically no budget, the pace is way too slow, and you don't really care what happens.All in all, pass on this one."
2,Not suitable for undergrads in general,I feel this is one of the most dense textbook I've encountered. I have no background with Numerical Analysis and I found this book next to impossible to understand. Please notice most 5 stars reviewers use this book as a REFERENCE!
3,Heavy Water,"Very heavy on analysis. Am sure would appeal to the rigorous guys, but I couldnt get much out of it. I switched to another title by Devorich."
5,Not a cookbook w/code. For folks serious about NA.,"This is a mathematics book, not a cookbook. It's worth buying this classic just to read the hidden sentence formed by the first letter of each sentence in their preface."
3,"stability,consistence and convergence","consistence,stability and convergence of multistep numerical methods for ordinary differential equations."
2,What's going on?,"This cd must be considered as a perfect background-soft-music recording. This is pure ear-candy! They present the music in a way that completely removes all the true drama and emotion from the music and turns it in to a, in my ears, quite embarrasing cliché. Who could expect something like this to show up in the year 2000. What can I say...let them have their fun! Turning music that was once serious and that truly expressed something real, into a circus is obviously what some people want to do. I'm glad though that most people take this music seriously instead of living out their childish fantasies about the baroque music, in a manner that would make the composers cry...or laugh!"
5,"Sanderson's ""Enchanted Wood""","This story teaches so much it is anything but 'weak'!! The folly of selfishness and vanity are foremost among the lessons to be learned. Devotion to a greater good than our own individual desires is modeled, and the pitfalls of the opposite character trait. I find it fascinating that the one temptation that ruled each of the first two princes turned out to be all 'smoke & mirrors'when the enchantment was gone. There WAS no black knight, only hack marks in the trees. So often in real life, the things that detour us from a noble purpose turn out to be irrelevant."
2,tea dust,I agree that this tea is great tasting but you are better off buying the tea bags. I thought the package would contain little tea leaves but instead its more like coarse sand. No matter how fine my tea strainer my mug is always full of tiny tea dust. Very frustrating!
4,Not the best but still very good,"I was not looking forward to this one when it came out, so I was surprised it was so good. Excellant music!"
1,Frustrated,"I received Pocahontas a while ago, but just opened it... it won't play! I hope something will be done quickly to resolve this issue!"
1,pocahontas,HI! I ACTUALLY AM NOT VERY HAPPY BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THE MOVIE I ORDERED! I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT THE SELLER TWICE THROUGH E=MAIL TO GET INFORMATION AND HAVE NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THEM EITHER! I AM VERY UNHAPPY BECAUSE THIS WAS TO BE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT! I HAVE BEEN CHARGED FOR THE MOVIE ON MY CREDIT CARD AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE NEXT STEP IS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM! IT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED IF SOMEONE COULD CONTACT ME! THANKS!SARAH GARRETSON
1,Racist Film with more MISrepresentations of Native Americans,"I really don't have time to write out all the inconsistencies. Just google ""The Real Pocahontas"" and you will find many critiques of the film. To begin with...that wasn't even her real NAME!"
2,Sigh. . .,"There is nothing like watching a DVD, a crowning glory of Western technology, that argues that all cultures are equal. At one point in this oppressive PC film, the not-at-all historical ""Pocahontas"" asks how John Smith can think that his culture is ""better."" One might suggest literacy as a basic improvement. Or the ability to make movies. This Disney film is dull and plodding. In my experience, once you buy it kids will seldom choose it, if you have a big enough Disney library."
3,A let down,"Not very true to Native American culture or the story of Pocahantas--which is true of most Disney movies. But if you're young (under age 8) and in to music, it's cute."
4,Pocahontas Review,"My daughter is only four but she liked this. We did have to explain to her about the violent parts, but once she heard that, she was okay with the entire movie."
4,A Good followup to Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.,"After the phenomenal successes of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and the awesome The Lion King, the Disney animators brought us Pocahontas. The film was good and is a definate Disney must. It may not have instant fame or that classic appeal like the past films have, but it will be remembered. The film has music, and beautiful artwork, and the voice talents are good too. All in all it is a Disney movie worth seeing. I definately reccomend this."
4,Just around the river bend...,"""What I love most about rivers is you can't step in the same river twice. The water's always changing, always flowing. But people I guess can't live like that, we all must pay a price. To be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing what's around the riverbend.""What really stands out in Pocahontas, to me, is the music. Not so much fancy special effects and stuff, but the songs are beautiful. The lyrics and the music just flow. The colors are vibrant and rich, truly a great film. I know every word to every song. All my friends do, and we range from 15 to 24. Maybe we're just sad... oh well!""Is all my dreaming at an end? Or do you still wait for me, dreamgiver, just around the riverbend?"""
1,Forced Previews on DVD Version,"The ""Pocohantas"" movie is OK, but my biggest beef with this product is that Disney is now using forced previews at the beginning of all their DVDs. These are over 5 minutes of dull Disney previews that you are FORCED to watch. You can't skip over them or fast forward through them, and you can't start the movie after them. If you want to watch the movie, you HAVE to watch the previews.This might not be such a big deal if you're only watching the movie once, but if you're like most families your kids will watch this movie over and over again. Then its really annoying.Disney should be ashamed for being so greedy that they have to put this defect in all their DVDs."
1,Bad DVD transfer,"I have most of Disney's Animation collection and look foward to the re-releases. Pocahontas on DVD is a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie. However the DVD version is NOT good. It is a bad transfer. The DVD version is grainy and the colors bleed. At this poor level of transfer, I would stick with the VHS version and wait for a better transfer version to come out."
3,Overall enjoyable,"I rate this straight down the middle. The music is pretty nice, as well as the animation but the story struck me as mediocre. Perhaps because the writers took great liberties in re-writing history. Still, I did for the most part enjoy watching it. I havent seen it in a while and probably won't but if you love Disney, then definetely watch this."
4,Great for 8+ year old,"This is a great Disney movie for the 8+ set. I think it's a bit heavy and complicated for younger kids. The music is great, the story is good, and I love that the main heroine is a strong, capable woman! Plus a bit of (slightly altered) history to boot."
5,Exactly as advertised!,"They were fast, and the product was exactly as advertised! I am very happy I bought with them. I would buy again for sure!"
1,Yuck!,"I was so disappointed in this movie. And it has nothing to do with the ""historical accuracy"" of the movie...what really bothered me was the way Pocohontas and her man apparently learned to speak each others' languages in about 5 seconds. I know they've got to condense that part of the story, but this is ridiculous!"
2,Poco-Loco...yucky!!,"99.9999% of the time I LOVE what Disney produces!! But once in a great while everyone gets a lemon. And this is Disneys sourest!!The premise was good, but I found the animation poor and the story extremely boring. Audiences will be graced with yet another good vs. evil type story. Throw in a heroine and give her strong earthy crunchy morals and you get this dribble. And of course there is a love story. <blink blink> And as a bonus to the so so animation, you will get a so so score.The good point to this movie is Mel Gibson, who does a wonderful job. Outside of that, we are looking at a story that will appeal to young kids who have never seen another Disney flick.At least rent before you buy on this one. Perhaps your opinion differs....."
2,A good plot destroyed by songs...,"The idea of making a cartoon where the woman is not only a dumb woman (like ""CInderella"", ""White Snow"", etc..,but a person with pride and intelligence, beside the fact that this doens't have a happy ending, was wasted by endless horrible songs. This is the cartoon made by Disney with more songs I've ever watched.!"
2,Pocahontas,Received the Movie today and the DVD case was broken and DVD was not stable in the package. Case will not even close. First time this as happened since I've been ordering from Amazon.
4,Disney's Best Film and Nicest Hero....,"I am not a Disney fan, but when my daughter was younger she wanted to see various Disney films and while I disliked a lot of them, this is one I really enjoyed.Of course, it isn't factual, the relations between Pocohontas and John Smith weren't as they are portrayed here, but it makes for a lovely story for kids and John Smith is a lovely hero, gung ho, funny and tender. Pocohontas is brave and independent, and for once the Disney empire's princess obsession is suited, as she was indeed a princess - or anyway, the daughter of the chief - in reality.Serious issues about imperialism and environmental abuse are actually touched on, and the songs are generally good. Of course, there is the obligatory one dimensional villain (and his villainous pet) but this isn't used to simplify the social issues, for once.I loved the sparkly magic effects when John Smith and Pochontas fall in love.Always snivelled at the ending, oh dear.Recommended."
1,Could it be anymore unrealistic!,Okay shoot me already. She suddenly can speak English and her best friend is tree. Allright Disney I'm tired of the whacky charactors already give it a rest!
2,"""flowers & trees"" had a stronger plot line","silly and insipid, and as grand as the resurrected animation department at disney was from ""little mermaid"" thru ""aladdin"" and ""lion King"" and ""beauty & the beast"", crud like this only reminded one of the era od ""the black cauldron""."
1,political correct nonsense,"This is a children's movie that no child should see. It is full of political correct inane, unthinking nonsense and the characters are depicted in a crass and coarse manner. No child should be subject to this foolish portrayal of the evil white man and the noble indian. I suggest that parents read accounts of King Phillip's War which raged across New England during the colonial period. Certainly there is enough criticism to go around to both groups and children should be taught a few complex truths."
1,Disney should be ashamed. As well as Mel and Demi,"It seems to me that people are afraid to give Disney bad reviews. DISNEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED! The true story of Pocahontas was not a cute little love story with cute animals. It is a story of the white man taking advantage of the naitve Americans. I get so angry when I think about all of the kids who will think that this was a happy story and that she ""fell in love."" I will make sure that my new nephew will never see this piece of ""junk"" until he is 18. Mel and Demi should be ashamed and give their monies to proper education. Grrr I am so MAD at these folks. I wish I could give a negaive star score!"
2,Ecstatic until unseen scratch ruined one scene,"This provider shipped the product quickly and everything appeared to be in wonderful condition, but halfway through the movie one entire scene kept skipping and freezing so the experience was ruined. I also wish I had known that none of the extra scenes would be included in the bonus features. I wish I could say everything was great but I was very disappointed. : ("
4,Pocahontas Video,"This video is very beautiful and not the slightest bit realistic. If you totally ignore history, and I LOVE history; there is incredible music and animation that make this video worth watching. I like that there is a strong woman role model even if she is strong for a man she loves. At four, my granddaughter is less interested in this one, so there is no reason to explain the discrepancies between reality and history or between actual Native Americans and the ones portrayed in this video, though the time will come. It is worth watching for its beauty. It is not part of my youth, so I have no comparison as to how the message touched me then and now."
1,Does me no good....,The DVD that was sent was in Italian and not playable....it arrived three weeks after I ordered. Seems like it is in good shape but Cannot be played.
4,New Version Still Coming,"Just a quick note here - if you are thinking of purchasing a copy of Pocahontas now, just wait a little while.On May 3, 2005, Disney will be releasing a ""Special Edition"", tenth anniversary, 2-disc DVD release that will be similar to thier recent reissue of Sleeping Beauty and other Disney classics.With all of the features on that, people who buy this DVD now will be disappointed if they don't wait.Disney will be adding the usual ""Making of"" clips, some pre-production art, and other features that make their ""Special Editions"" great, to this new edition of Pocahontas."
1,DVD quality poor,"This is one of Disney's best animated films, but the DVD does not do our favorite little Native American any justice. Pocahontas is beautifully animated, but something is really wrong with the transfer here to the disc. Colors are all messed up...John Smith looks like he has bugs crawling all over him in every scene because he appears ""snowy."" I don't really know the best way to describe it. As for the sound, it's an OK Dolby 5.1 mix...the songs and score are wonderful. But what took me aback from this movie when I saw it in the theater was the glorious animation. The DVD has ruined this aspect of the film and Disney really needs to hurry up and re-release a newly transferred version (I've heard rumors that the Mouse House does have a new 2-disc SE of Pocahontas ready to go...when they decide to release it, who knows.)If you want to buy this disc, I would strongly recommend waiting."
1,Poca Haunts Us,"Disney was on a roll: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Alladin, and the Lion King. After The Lion King, it appeared Disney could do no wrong. Well, Pocahontas dispelled that myth. While this 10th anniversary edition was carefully put together, it does not hide the fact that at its core is a severely flawed and uninspired movie. The movie's slow pace makes it somewhat difficult to watch despite the brilliant colors and awesome sound. Disney fans are used to action and adventure appearing at expected and unexpected moments. And there's always a love story somehwere. Pocahontas, however, is almost devoid of any action and really does not have a love story. For that matter, there isn't much of any kind of story. I am sure that Pocahontas, a legendary figure in our history, deserved a much better treatment that this hauntingly weak Disney dud."
5,One of my favorites,"This is one of my favorite Disney movies, although I'd wager a lot of people consider this to be one of the worst Disney movies. The use of color and song in this movie are key. It's a romanticized version of the historical Pocahontas, but it's still a fun and engaging story with highs and lows."
4,Good Childrens Movie,"I rate this 4 stars because nothing is perfect and this movie has a fair share of flaws. My only real problem with this film is the sometimes annoying animal buddies that detract from the feel of the rest of the plot. Other then that I love the plot, Characters, Art, Animation, and Music, Heck I would buy a whole new CD if they ever release the in movie version of ""If I never knew you""."
4,"This is a Disney Movie, NOT a documentation.","For those of you who criticize Pocahontas because it does not protray her actual life correctly, you must remember that this movie was not supposed to be a documentation. Disney movies are aimed toward the kid audience and they have to be appealing to them. Pocahontas is a great movie, Disney did very well with it, and although the facts are not all necessarily correct, you should try and realize that they weren't supposed to be."
5,Prompt Delivery,I don't think this took even three days after ordering to arrive. My daughter was thrilled to have this dvd once again and was nearly as excited as when she was 4. That was 16 years ago!
4,"Unique style, excellent animation ... tired old formula.","Disney's animators did such a great job on this film. The designs, colors, effects are all superb ... so why is this film so tiresome? Revisionist history, pervasive cutsey side kicks (Jar-Jar syndrome), politically 'correct' mystification, and intrusively obnoxious camp broadway singing reminisant of bad old musical movies make this film a shameful pandering to media percieved audience clamorings. As the relatively (for Disney) sad box-office earnings displayed, no one wanted to see a white bread perversion of history. I should have rated Pocohontas at less stars, except the masterful art staff elevated pc filth into a higher form. Kudos to the animation staff, shame on Disney."
4,DISNEY DOES IT AGAIN...,"Though this Disney musical does not have the pure fantasy and magic of their true classic films (Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, etc.), it is a beautiful and easy-to-swallow history lesson all the same. The history, while embellished and changed to contain a love story and a few forest creatures with sparkling personalities, paints a noble picture of Native Americans, and is sure to engender conversation in your family. As pure entertainment, the old Disney touches are here in spades, from the omnipresent swirling flurries of colored leaves, to the gliding, hypnotic romps through the rivers and forest, to the melody-soaked score, which includes the hit Colors of The Wind and the equally lovely Just Around The Riverbend. Disney's Pocahontas is a true babe; an independent spirit and a good foible for the bad guys, who of course show up sooner rather than later."
3,"An Average Disney Movie, more pretty than beautiful","Pocahontas is a more serious Disney, that is good in the first viewing."
3,"Nice Music, Bad Plot","I have nothing against Disney trying to inject some culture/information into kids, really I don't but I Do think they should try a little harder then this! I liked the music and apparently so did most of the adults in America, judging from the charts. But the movie was very unsatisfactory, hey I love happy endings and yeah I didn't enjoy when Pocahontas stayed while John Smith left, but the point is that Disney should have to warp history so much to teach it."
1,Pocahontas,"This movie was purchased from seller: moviesonsale1, and would not even play half way through. The seller of this product placed information in the evelope with the movie saying that if any negative feedback was received they would no longer be able to help you. They also gave a false phone number as a point of contact. I would never purchase anything from this seller again."
4,It's Only A Cartoon!,"I know a lot of people who didn't like this movie because it completely twisted the facts of history. And we know that's true. However, speaking as a history buff, I have to say that those changes didn't hurt my enjoyment of this delightful piece of family entertainment. The music is solid and quite lovely, written by two professionals from Broadway, Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. The story, while somewhat sappy for adults, will bring knowledge against prejudice to the young minds who watch it. The things young children view has a profound effect on the rest of their lives, so why not give them something with a message? I hardly consider this a great film, or a film that is in any way historical fiction. However, this film has many good and cute sides, and can't be judged to harshly for what it lacks."
3,Not Disney's best,"This movie has its high points (a couple of good songs, some beautiful animation) but these moments are too rare to make Pocahontas truly enjoyable. The moralizing is constant and oppressive--even for a Disney film! Most of the characters are uninteresting in the extreme, and the typical comic relief animals are more annoying than in most animated fare.I'm sure the kids will enjoy Pocahontas, but adults will find themselves cringing, groaning or yawning."
5,Wonderful sound track,Great movie for the kids (although not historically very accurate) or a relaxing evening at home with your Wife.Typical Disney story with a happy ending and great music!!! Good story for the whole family.
5,My Daughter Loves It.,"We had a video of Pocahontas, but needed/wanted a DVD. Since we got it in the mail she won't stop playing it. She's two yrs old and tries her best to sing along with all of the songs. Thank you for a great product."
3,Terrible video transfer to DVD,"Let me start off by saying the storyline of this movie was very good. It is the only thing that kept my review from going down to two stars. Now for the bad news. This has got to be the worst transfer to DVD I have ever seen. With all the digital magic that DVD boasts of having, you figure that Disney would at least match the quality of their video tape for this title. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I am not one who usually complains about such things. In fact, you won't hear me ranting and raving over the historical facts of the film. Let's face it, this is Disney and the story is written with children in mind. If anyone is going to take historical figures and turn them into a fairy tale, it is Disney. That is to be expected. What is not expected is a grainy horrible video transfer we find here. This DVD is for Disney DVD collectors (unfortunately like myself) only. Otherwise, buy the video tape."
2,Disney could have done a much better job.,"I actually wanted to give this one star, but my sentimental attachment to all things Disney forced me to throw in a bonus point.I know it's for kids. I know it's for entertainment's sake. But....There is so much that is of value in the truth. I don't know why the actual story had to be turned into this PC mish-mash. Disney's adult fans will not be amused. If it's for the kid's sake, please just rent it or borrow it from the library. And, while you're at the library, be sure to pick up some of the wonderful books for kids and teens that tell the facts in just as exciting a manner.If you really want to excite your children about history, take them to Jamestown and Colonial Williamsburg, where history really does come to life!"
2,Buy Tarzan Instead,"This poking, plodding snoozer barely rates two stars. The songs are dreary and poorly rendered, and the plot is almost nonexistent. Everybody in America knows the Pocahontas legend and can state it in a paragraph; Disney fluffs it into 80 minutes of wooden characters and lousy songs. This movie has none of the zip of Alladin or Hercules, and none of the charm of The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast. Unless you want to collect all the Disney animated shows, take a pass on this one and spend your money on Tarzan instead."
2,A nose dive for Disney,"Now just listen to me here. Imagine the disney movie life as pryimid. First we had Beauty and the Beast, then we had Aladdin, then the Lion King shot the Disney movie quality to the top of the pyrmid. Then came Pocahontas.And Disney took a nose dive.Making the classic tale of Pocahontas into a movie may have sounded like a good idea. But with all the crazy historical innacuricies you need to wonder what story it was actually based on. I'm sure by now you all know what really happened in the end. And John Smith's version of the tale was an exageration from the beginning (I have a friend that's related to our herione I know!) I do give it 2 stars for the music though, that was pretty good."
1,Pocahontas (Disney Gold Classic Collection),"We all sat down one Sunday evening with our two children - a little over 2 and almost 4 - to watch Pocahontas. We were all enjoying it very much - beautiful Pocahontas, the funny racoon and hummingbird and the majestic scenery... Then the violence started. The Indian was shot DEAD, the people were angry, the Indians were called ""savages"" then John Smith was seriously injured. I thought this movie was pointless and violent. I do not recommend it to any one much less any one under 8."
1,Inappropriate for children,"Disney's fictionalized love story between the 12 year old Pocahontas and the 27 year old John Smith can only leave us praying that this didnt happen in real life. (Pocahantas married John Rolfe when she was 19 and had a child, which is, of course, left out of this movie).Even if you get passed the blatant pedophilia overtones, the movie is still filled with bland musical numbers, and boring dialogue."
4,Streaming vs. Disc,"Okay, so I got the instant video version of this movie. That is good for the main reason of not having to replace it, because the movie will always be in your video library (unless something should happen like Amazon going out of business or something, but I don't anticipate that to happen anytime soon). You don't have to worry about the disc getting scratched, or worried about it getting lost or whatever. The bad thing about streaming movies is that you only get the movie with no options. I can't get subtitles, and there's none of the extra stuff that you get when you buy the disc. All you get with streaming is the movie itself, which I suppose is fine, but not if you're interested in the extra bonus materials. I gave it four stars for the movie itself, but took off a point because Amazon should be able to put the full content options that the DVD/BluRay has. It is 2013 you know! I'm sure they could."
2,Not a good French version,"I bought this version because it had the French language version, and I want my kid to watch Disney in French since we live in the US and he is not exposed to enough French. I was looking forward to hearing the voices and the songs I had liked so much. For each and every Disney movie from that collection that I have bought, none of them has the original French we had back in France. The voices are different and the song lyrics are too! They also happen to be of poor quality which does not help."
2,Where's the Sound,i bought this dvd for my 3 year old daughter and when my wife played the dvd there was no soundWTF!!!!!!
3,Marple Fan,"As a Marple fan I found this book to be pleasant enough though lacking a little depth , which may be my fault in looking or taking a view that it did not quite come up to my expectations. As I say pleasant light reading with possibility a little too much repetition , a little light humour. If you are looking for some nice light reading take it on the plane with you."
2,It is OK,You get what you pay for. It is just abit to long to fit in my 2006 Nissan Frontier. It is not a good radio.
5,Want to know Joseph's Coat?,"A delightful story that promotes a love of books.Note to the Teacher: Let your student's imagination work. Example,""What can you make out of nothing much?"""
2,If only this book were as good as their shaving products,"I have three comments about this book.1. If they had not spent so much time repeating the same three things, this book would be only half as long as it is. The actual advice is sound but really you don't need to repeat it over and over (unless you're looking for word count)2. If you're trying to sell me a Cadillac, don't give me a Yugo after I've paid you. This book (the hardbound edition) is probably pretty cool as a coffee table piece, but otherwise not worth the price (see comments 1&3)3. All of the useful information in this book is also in a Youtube video by these same people.All that being said this is a really nice if a bit expensive sales brochure. I had already purchased some of their shaving products, and love them. This book however is something that I am very dissapointed in."
3,A Trivial But Not Unworthy Effort,"I have read many articles in magazines and on the web on the fine art of shaving and I found nothing new in this very slender book. In my opinion it is not worth the price. Better and more detailed information is available from other sources. However, if this is your sole introduction to shaving, it is worth a read."
4,"Hey, Coach!","This book is like a good coach on shaving, and also on general hygiene. For example it states why one should shave with the grain first (and not against) and also it explains what type of person should wear a goatee, and how, and also how to trim your sideburns (so as to make sure that they are even). He also recommends to use a facial scrub once or twice a week (on days you aren't shaving), etc. The author also throws in some history at the beginning (like how men used to sharpen flint or sharks teeth to shave). Anyways, it was a nice light and enjoyable read. I think I finished it in about 3 sittings. Some very useful information in a nice package. Only gave it 4 stars because the pictures could have been better/more helpful. Every other page or so has like a random picture of a brush. Why not put something more useful, like the proper blade angle that should be used on the face, or what a proper lather should look like."
2,"Very short, and somewhat incomplete","This is a very short book that would be reasonably priced at $5 or below, but really not worth the price it sells for. It has a few useful things, but nearly all of them I'd already seen--free--on various web sites. It fails to go deeply into a few things that could use it, and excessively promotes one particular brand of razor that isn't anything great to begin with. Overall I'm disappointed with the book and would not recommend it."
1,Absolute garbage.,"You don't need to buy this - you can read the whole thing in five minutes if you go to an Art Of Shaving retail outlet. Seems to have been written by someone who A)Has never shaved; B)works for said Art Of Shaving retail store. This book has little to do with wetshaving and everything to do with selling AoS's extremely overpriced, sub-par crap. This thing doesn't deserve one star. It would make an acceptable shim for a short table leg, but that's as useful as this little pamphlet gets."
5,digital postal scale,"This product was shipped quickly. It is concise, neat in appearance, and very easy to use. We are pleased with this particular scale and it's accuracy. Would definitely recommend."
1,Didn't work,"My scale arrived and did not work. I would never buy one of these products again, it looks really cheaply put together."
5,Wonderful,"This scale is great, I can now put large packages on a scale and be able to save the weight so I can see it when I remove the package. It is small and light and just great."
4,cute and easy,This bird bath was easy to put together and set up. It is attractive and the birds like it too. It is easy to clean but I do wonder if it will rust without constant maintenance. Otherwise it is a very nice addition in my backyard.
1,Two Whole Discs of Bad Music,"""Atrocious"" doesn't adequately describe P's latest effort. It seems the only real effort he is making is to bite Tupac. Derivative at best. Irritating at worst. At least it's his last album. Ugh."
1,WHY??????,"Master P is a commercial rapper. The only reason people listen to his music and like it is because the radio tells them too. I will admit that his beats may be ""hype,"" but this does not justify his complete last of skills. Master P is not rap music, but dance music. Don't call it hip hop."
1,What's the hype 'bout Master P??,I just can't see the hype involved with Master P. His rap is slow and boring and he sounds like a grandpa!! Pathetic.
1,the dumbest crap i've heard since vanilla ice,"Well, i've listened (actually, endured) to this double (c)rap record, and there's something that keeps bugging me.... Why did half a million people (morons, if you asked me) spend their (hard-earned?) money to buy this garbage in its first week of release? The production values on this record are a joke, and the lyrical and melodic content are an absolute joke. The only great thing about this record is that its supposed to be his last album. HALLELUIA!!!"
1,punka$$ haterz,yall need to hear some good muzik not like this guy he cant rap.u need to hear latin rappers ! no limit goin down
4,NO LIMIT 4 LIFE,This iss by farr the best album by no limit rcords. It has great bass and lyrics plus lots of no limit soldiers in it. Masterp has done it again.
5,This was P's Last Album!!!,"Most folks say he lied because he dropped more albums. totally false. this was P's last album before going pop. when he realized that he was just unforgivably lame, he tried to take it back to the streets. you cant do that. what was he thinking. i could have slept better if he retired on this album."
4,You have to be a fan of the genre to appreciate the music,"I'll say this right off, who has the time or money to listen to everything that Master P has to offer? Not even me. I have listened to and can only comment on 3 of his album's. But, he has anywhere up to 4 other releases I haven't had the pleasure of listening to. This album is quite good (even if you're not a fan of the genre, I recommend it), though it could never top ""Ghetto D."" Once again, however, if you're not a fan of the genre, don't even bother reviewing these albums. We don't care about your opinions and you don't exist."
1,"boo boo, this iz garbadge ull weak",DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS CD IT IZ THA MOST GARBADGE CD I HAVE EVER WITNESSED. ALL OF HIS BEATS SOUND LIKE HES BANGIN ON A POT. MANNY FRESH AND THA HOT BOYZ R WAY BETTER YOU SHOULD GO BY AND PICK UP JUVENILES THA G CODE ALONG WITH LIL WAYNES THA BLOCK IZ HOT (AKIRA)
1,a joke,"anything on master ps label is a disgrace to hip-hop. Master P is the worst rhymer and delivers his raps in a truly unattractive drawl. Never innovative or creative, master p releases another joke for an album. If you want some true southern rap, get outkast or goodie mob.don't get me wrong, I didnot buy this album, but i've heard it."
4,Tight Album!,"I just don't undastand why hella people keep h8'n on Master P and No Limit Records! This is P's best solo album next to Ghetto D! The best songs are Thinkin Bout U, Soldiers Riders & G's, Thug Girl, Dear Mr. President, Mama Raised Me, Let My 9 Get Em, Ghetto Life, Let's Get Em, Goodbye To My Homies, Ghetto Love, Hot Boys & Girls, and Eternity! If you like hip hop str8 from the streets, this album is most definetly 4 U! Buy it!"
1,"Master P is horrible, and this cd proves it!","First let me start by saying i did not buy this cd, it was given to me by my cousin. (Who hates it as well) Second, heres a summary: This cd is absolutly horrible. Beats-garbage, Rhymes-garbage, in fact-Master P himself has turned rap into a joke.....he was good in the first TRU (TRUE) But thats it-now hes nothing."
1,MASTER P IS USING TUPAC'S LYRICS TO SELL RECORDS.,"Many people don't know this but I am going to reveal Master P's big secret to the world. On Master P's final solo album he is using Tupac's style and he is also using some of his songs. For example, Master P has a song that Tupac made called Dear Mr. President on his album. I also hear that Master P is trying to buy unrealesed Tupac songs from Tupac's mother. I personally think that this is terrible. Master P is destroying what little we have left of Tupac. Please Master P don't buy these songs. I know No Limit records can made their own songs. There are alot of talented artists on No Limit. Give them the opportunity to write there own songs. Quit stealing songs from Tupac. Peace."
1,Bile Style,I love hip hop. But this record is a slap in the face for any true fan of the form. There is nothing original about this record. No rhythm you haven't heard. No style. No finess. It pains me to see this album do well when there are so many underground guys out there doing it so much better. If you want to be entertained by flash and glitz this record is for you. But even that stops at the album cover. If you want reall hip hop music...look somewhere else.
1,Horrible beyond belief,"This may well be the worst cd ever made. I can't even comprehend now why I bought it, but it was a huge waste of my money. It is truly amazing to me that Master P can make a 2 cd set with not one even slightly good song on it. If you're thinking about buying this cd, don't."
1,Straight Garbage.,"For every step forward an East Coat lyricist takes, a dirty South rapper takes four steps back. Master P's ""Da Last Don"" tries its hardest to keep listeners trapped in a musical Dark Age, devoid of creativity and intelligence. This album's productions sounds like it was concocted by a tone deaf accountant on a contact high. The lyrics are pointless at best, an abomination at worst.As a rule, I like to steer clear of CDs with jewel-encrusted label logos or with the words ""Cash Money"" or ""No Limit"" printed anywhere on them. I suggest you do the same."
1,hahahaahahahaaha GAY,ok now youve got these fabricated hip hop fans arguing over cashmoney and no limit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ATTENTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CASHMONEY AND NO LIMIT IS THE EXACT SAME GARBAGE PEACE
2,Master P last Album huh,"I'm gonna just make this plain and simple,this album is way too long and most of it has that west coast feel too it(which isn't bad if you like it). Not that many guest appearnces which make it good but again, this album suffers from way too many of the same formulas on some of the songs. Tales of drugs, sex, and violence.If this album could have been cut to 15 tracks and had some songs of sex, some songs of violence and some songs of bling bling, street tales, and etc., this album could have been a classic in a way, beacuase Master P can rhyme and can make hits, but this album is more of a publicity stunt to try to get people to buy his last album which really isn't his last album( Master P is rich and is a better money maker than music maker). '' Da Last Don'', can be past on as of many other Master P albums after Ghetto D. If you are a hardcore No limit fan or a Master P fan you can pick this one up but if not, I suggest you past on this mediocore effort."
2,MP Da Last Don-1998,There is 2 CDs so you know that will be and issue wich it is.It has 29 songs on it and has some guest apearences and also hasyour typical what you get on a Master P album feel to it.Lyrics 6/10 Production 7/10 X Factor 3/10 Style 7/10 Voice 7/10Music 5/10 Innovative 4/10 Classic 2/10 guest 8/10 Blends 6/10Overall=55 wich is good for its 2.5 Mic rating that it getsMaster P fans it is and Ok buy no buy anyone else.
1,Waste of $$,Don't buy this album. Master P has a quantity over quality approach. 2 discs of absolute garbage. I'd pay the $20 it cost me again just so I could get rid of this CD.
1,this cd stinks,this is the worst cd ive ever heard he and his lttle no limit soilders cant rap!!!!!!!
1,Master P is wack and so is all of the No Limit soliders,I would of gave this a 0 and all of the other No Limit CDs but I can't. No Limit gets worse and worse. Sorry to all you No limit fans out there but Master P sucks! He samples way too much and puts out wack albums every month but they still sell like hotcakes. I don't know. If you want a good album I suggest Jay Z or DMX. y'heard!
2,What a SORRY A$$ way to go out!,"Since this is supposedly Master P's last album I ran out and bought it the minute it was released, I wish I could return this piece of $#!t. This album was extremely dissapointing especially since its a double CD and both of them are BOOTY. After Ice Cream Man, Ghetto D, and every other No Limit production he's been a part of I expected much more from the Last Don. Except for a few songs like Till we dead and gone, So many souls deceased,and Gangsta B!tc# the beats and rhymes just wasnt tight. Most of the songs on this CD are just too mellow and Not straight up gangsta $#!t like Im used to hearin from P. If you havent bought this yet save your money and buy Silkk the Shocker instead."
3,P never was a great rapper...,"and he proves that with Da Last Don. Hearing him pop up sporadically on other NL releases is fine but two albums of his UGHHH gets old and annoying. Snoop appears WAY to often and doesn't fit in to the NL sound. But, if you're a NL fan it's worth the money, all the regulars show up on at least one song. Make 'em Say Ughh #2 could have saved the album, BUT, they replaced Mystikal's part with Snoop."
2,Average,"Master P's last realease is only average, if you're not a hardcore No Limit fan, don't waste money on this album."
2,Make emm say uhhh! I don't think so.,Let's face it those days of 'Ghetto D' are over No Limit is finished. Just try and compare this album to something like 'Tha DoggFather' or 'The Slim Shady LP' and you'll see how bad this album really is. The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is because of the track with Bone Thugs on because that track is tight apart from that Master P needs to give up rap and stick to producing or try and go back to the days of 'Ghetto D'.
2,A very over rated album,This was a very dissapionting CD. When i bought the CD i was looking forward to listening to it. I heard each track thinking the next one will be better. After id been though each track i took it back to Virgin records the next day and got my money back. The only thing good about the CD was the front cover.
2,Throw it in the garbage with the other No Limit albums,"Once again the don of maketing somehow got this ""music"" hyped up enough to have people buy it when it is reeeaaaalllly bad.I dont know how you givin it 5 stars- a real 5-star album is 2pac's ""All Eyez On Me"". A style Master P tries to copy every album. well, IT STILL AINT WORKIN! As with all musicians, there are always hard-core fans that will buy anything the guy makes even if it sux. I would only recommend this CD to those hardcore P fans. Everyone else- save your money and dont believe the hype- u not missin anything great by not buying it, there are much better rapppers to spend your $$$ on."
4,okay/alright,"I think Master P is a talented artist. To me Master P could have done a better job. I am a No Limit Fan but Master P just went lazy on this one. So hopefully everyone else will do better to keep No Limit at the top. OH, speaking of the CD the movie was WACK!!!!!"
5,P's s**t is the bomb.,If you don't have P's music you need to be at the music store know. It is a basic need. There is no other music like P. and my baby snoop. Keep coming with it baby.
4,DA LOST DON MAKES IT'S MARK!,"Master p makes his mark on the rap industry felt,catchy hooks,all star appearences and excellent producing makes this album a must have in any rap/hip-hop collection.Some of the highlight of this album:Thinking bout you,make um say uh.If you don't have this, get it."
5,THIS CD KICKED A$$!!!!!!!,"this cd was off the hook,the best No Limit cd ever! along with silkk the shockers made mann and c-murders trapped in crime which r not as good but pretty close!Allllll the songs are good on this one! every cd should be like good enough to where u can play it from beginning to end and enjoy it,and thats how this one is!"
3,It's alright,To many people make a big deal about P. Making it seem like he has more skills than he has. He's good but he's not great.
2,You don't need it!!!,"My advice to you would be to crack the cd, take it back to the store it was purchased from, ask them why they sold you a cracked cd, and ask for a refund."
2,"I luv no limit, but this was no good.","I love P, and Ghetto D was and still is my favorite CD of all time, but this was a dissapointment, especially if your going out. c'mon P you can do hella better than that, come out with another, make it good this time!"
5,I thought tha CD kicked some some serious A!!,"The cd had alot of good Rappers besides Master P and the Cd is definitly if not his best atlest in the top 3, a good remix of the song ""make um say Uhhhh"" was in the cd. Let's just say it kicked butt!!"
1,THIS CD STINKS,"After I had listened to Ice Cream Man and Ghetto D, I was convinced that The Last Don would be a tizite cd. But after listening to it i think it sucks. there are no tizite songs at all, the whole cd sucks. all the no limit soldiers suck except for my man c-murder, get his new cd bossalinie if you're gonna get a no limit cd."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,EVEN THOUGH SOME TRACT ON HERE WAS OFF THA HOOK. OTHERS DID NOT MAKE ANY SENSE TOO ME. MASTER P YOUR CAREER IS OVER. THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO DO IS CHILL AND PRODUCE MY BOY MYSTICAL
3,THIS ALBUM WASN'T THAT GREAT.,I WAS HOPING 4 SUM REAL DOWN SOUTH BOUT IT BOUT IT BEATS AND RAPS. THIS ALBUM DOESNT HAVE THAT. I LIKE THE FAST SH*T DAT MAKES U BOUNCE. IF YA'LL KNOW A NL ALBUM DAT HAS DAT HOLLA BACK ON MY EMAIL.
3,MASTER P CAN DO MUCH BETTER.,"MASTER P COULD BE A GOOD RAPPER IF HE DIDN'T SAY UHHH EVERY 5 SECONDS. P'S LYRICS R TIGHT THOUGH AND I JUST LOVE THAT SONG HOT BOYS AND GIRLS,GET YOUR PAPER WOULD BE GOOD TOO IF E40 DIDN'T MESS IT UP WITH HIS BAD RAPPING BUT BY FAR THE BEST SONG IS TIL WE DEAD AND GONE BONE THUGS AND P WORK WELL TOGETHER. CONGRATULATIONS THOUGH P ANOTHER PLATINIUM HIT NOT AS GOOD AS I GOT THE HOOK UP THOUGH. KEEP IT REAL P CAUSE I KNOW U WILL. O YEAH BY THE WAY GET RID OF MR. SERV ON AND MAGIC THEY R MESSING UP YO STLYE. PEACE OUT."
5,cd one=4.5 stars cd two=3.5 stars,"pretty good double disc. has a cool cover. best songs on disc one are till we dead and gone f/bonethugs,get your paper f/e-40,war wounds,soldiers riders and g's,and mama raised me. best on disc two are goodbye to my homies,eternity,let's get em and ghetto life.total stars for album=4.5"
2,Master P - MP Da Last Don,"This was supposed to be P's last album and I wish it was. There were a lot of problems with this album: (1) a double album, which was the style of 1998, with only two good songs on it (""Hot Boys & Girls"", ""Solders, Riders & G's""), (2) No Limit Records were putting out albums faster than Mickey D's serves burgers and with the usual guest stars on this album (virtually the whole No Limit roster) on every single song, you couldn't tell the difference between this album and, say, a Skull Duggery album. (3) is that Master P was starting to sound too much like 2Pac (like most rappers around that time). For Master P's good stuff, check out Ghetto D, 99 Ways to Die, Ice Cream Man or TRU's True or Tru to Da Game."
1,THIS CD CAN S*CK IT!!!!,THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST CD I HAVE EVER BOUGHT! WHEN I FIRST ORDERED IT FROM THE INTERNET I WAS REALLY EXCITED THEN IT CAME AND IT WAS SH*T. I SUGGEST CHECKING OUT DMX OR JAY-Z.
4,So much Adams so little time.,"Currenty, there are many fine books, McCullough's Adams, Founding Brothers, Nagel's book on JQA, etc. Too much to read so I opt for the audio version (unabridged of course) of Passionate Sage to listen to when I can't read or the eyes give out."
2,Discursive amblings on how cantankerous Adams was,"Here we have a fugue on what a contrary figuer John Adams was. It is not a chronological narrative of his life--those who may want that must look elsewhere. It is a survey of his ideas beginning, often returning (too often), at his packing to leave Washington after losing his bid for a second term. The ideas explored are not systematically arranged, nor are they looked into with much depth. It tells us how much Adams just did not get along with folks, again, and again-- I can't recommend this book, especially to those of us that like a good biographic narrative, nor to those who like extensive and linearly arranged expositions of a famous thinkers thought. I must say how surprised I am at the high ratings given by many reviewers."
1,"Author invented his Vietnam war experience,Why?","The book seemed OK , until I discovered that Mr. Ellis had invented his experience as a Vietnam Vet . If somebody does this, what's the value of the book?"
5,McCullough's Poor Cousin,"Despite some controversy regarding Ellis's plagiarism from other sources for this book, I love it. I feel the the much more popular McCullough view of Adams is also excellent but would encourage people to t read this book because for me it presented the mind of John Adams much more clearly. I prefer it, despite the protests of my friends and colleagues who do not see what I see in this book, a gem."
3,A very good book with three stars on a very tough scale.,"I enjoyed reading this book very much- on my scale three stars in well worth reading. The book is very much written from the perspective of the end of Adams' life. Though it looks over much of his life it is not a complete biography- more like a series of interconnected shorts. I see this as a positive since it allows one to study a smaller area well rather than try to take in the entire life of the man. I think the books is at its best in allowing one to see and understand the character and nature of a very interesting and difficult to grasp man. Adams is an especially interesting individual with which to do this. The author has digested his subject well and I believe captures a good portion of the nature of Adams- no mean feat. The quality of the writing is quite good though not of that rare, excellent quality. I'd heartily recommend this book."
5,Excellent Bio of John Adams,"Ellis' biography of John Adams, one of the earliest published portraits of the Founding Fathers by the author, is well suited for those who want a shorter, crisper account than the longer ones produced by other biographers (e.g., McCullough). Though it does not include some important material unearthed since its appearance, it honors Adams' essential brilliance and his determinative role in both the success of the American Revolution and the country's endurance while a Federalist president."
3,Passionate Sage:John Adams,"Not exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a more chronologicalbiographical story. This author did a great job with George Washingtonfrom beginning to end. In John Adams he skips around through differentphases of his life. Very in depth and sometimes complicated on his descriptionof Adams. I'm still reading but it is a hard book to understand for a novice reader like myself, even though I am a true American history fan"
3,Occasionally Dry,"Joseph Ellis does an excellent job at giving life to the internal mechanisms that were at work inside of John Adams as he formed his political opinions. Focusing almost exclusively on the retirement years of Adams and his writings from his home in Quincy, Ellis makes sense of a man that hated the mythical makings of the Revolutionary generation and yet desired for his own name to be admitted to the pantheon that George Washington and Benjamin Franklin were already sharing. The only shortcoming is that Ellis hasn't quite worked out the fluidity of the language as he has with more recent works (i.e. Founding Brothers) In spite of the occasionally dry wording this is still a good place to start for someone interested in this intriguing character."
5,Introduction to our charmingly obnoxious founding father,"Ellis' work focuses on the latter part of Adams' life. While it makes no claim to be a complete biography, the book serves as an excellent foundation for those seeking to learn more about our most underappreciated founding father. Through detailed comparisons with Jefferson - Adams' rival and close friend who has been treated more kindly by America's collective consciousness - Ellis begins to illuminate many levels of the New Englander's character. In doing so, he helps us understand why Adams was not, and probably never will be, adored by the nation he helped to create"
4,Introduction to Wrights Brothers,This book is a very simple and fun introduction to the Wright's Brothers for transitional readers. I used it with one second grader and two third graders as their first chapter book we did as a group. They really enjoyed it. It was right at their reading level and perfect for our use.
5,TOTAL SHAWN LANE FAN,THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING LIVE RECORDING EVER MADE...OF COURSE WITH THE MOST FANTASTIC GUITAR PLAYER ON EARTH...SHAWN LANE.THE SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN THE 3 MUSICIANS IS AMAZING.BUY OR DIE!!!
2,This book turned out to be a disappointment.,"The poetry was well-written, but the content was grim and combative. I didn't enjoy it and never finished it. I would only recommend this book to resentful feminatzis."
1,An upset hardcore fan of The Boss,"I bought this book all ready to be able to sit down with my harmonica and piano and bust out Thunder Road. The piano music doesn't follow Bruce Springsteen's piano at all. It was really upsetting. Instead they throw in the vocal melody in with the piano music. So all those people who love to sing along with Bruce don't need to because it's in the piano all ready. Other songs leave out important musical parts to include the vocal melody in the transcription. I want to know if there's anywhere you can buy the real note for note transcriptions. Honestly, I would have rather saved my money and spent my time figuring out the songs myself."
4,This was my first CD ever bought.,"I bought this CD when there was need to test the stereosystem almost 10 years ago. I must say, music by Space is very inspiring, really in the mood of 70s vision of cosmos and interstellar trips. I rate it 4 stars though - Space sound get a bit dated as years pass, not the way it happens with Jarre's music."
4,Get the spirit,"Hampton Hawes sounds cheerful and relaxed in his last recording session before going to federal prison for five years, doing a jazzification of some some spirituals with which he would have been familiar from his childhood as a minister's son. And he's in superb company. Bassist Leroy Vinnegar may have had his technical limitations, but few players on his instrument ever filled the sonic space of the bass with such unerring taste and unshakable swing. And drummer Stan Levey is a West Coast jazz legend, showing a different side to his personality by playing brushes mostly on this date, and even some bells on a rollicking, danceable ""Jericho"". A fine piano trio date that, unjustifiably, languished in Contemporary Records' vaults for 29 years."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"Been waiting to acquire this soundtrack for a few years. I am a huge fan of the show, and the music helps make the show. I love the music! It's great to listen to at any time."
5,Wonderful Soundtrack,Price did a wonderful job with the soundtrack. It's a pleasure to listen to when working. Several of the tracks are also ideal for ringtones.
1,Crap - stay away,"Looking at the parameters it is really a nice machine. Visually - same thing.What makes it useless is that the keyboard stops functioning in BRAND NEW OUT OF THE BOX machines. Search the web and you will find many examples. My laptop was alive 2 weeks - now Icannot use it as some of the keys do not work.What happens next you call the customer service and they say they send you the return box. And then they have 10 business days to repair the useless piece of junk that your $1300 just turned into.I had many IBMs and DELLs, for periods of couple of years long. None of that laptops broke in 3 weeks, no even in a couple of years. My last laptop, also a VAIO burned after a year and 2 months. The truth is - Sony makes crappy laptops and has a really poor customer service. If you want waste time and money - GO FOR THAT VAIO."
1,BE WARNED - MAJOR FLAW,"WARNING: Do not buy a new Sony Vaio of any kind with Vista if you want to record any audio off of your sound card - meaning the internet. Sony has permanently disabled the ""wave"" or ""stereo out"" abilities of they're new computers. On all other major brands there is a simple two click solution, but Sony has deemed it in their best interests to make it impossible to reverse. This is a serious and deliberate flaw that they've built into their computers with bigger ""corporate interests"" in mind, not the usefullness of their computers to the average consumer. Be warned. See this forum for more information.[...]"
2,Very poor design and lasting battery,"I have bought about 11 Sony Vaio laptops for myself and family. My eldest still working with his factory fitted battery although with very short time, but enough for changing from wall plug.After 1 1/2 year The FZ140E/S battery stopped without any warning thanks to an special internal device controlling the electrical flow. I am so disappointed that a never again considered buying another Sony Viao computer."
3,One Flaw that kills my love for it,"I bought my Sony from Circuit City in 2007. I loved it, it has all kinds of cool things and once you uninstall all the lousy clutter it is beautiful. Then, right after my 1 year warranty ended several keys on the keyboard died. I did not spill anything on it. I still love my laptop, but this flaw makes it impossible for me to choose Sony again. The screen is great, the size and weight are wonderful, the sound is a bit quiet, but good enough for me. But a messed up keyboard sours all of that."
5,sony viao review,"really nice laptop, would recommed it although even with 2 gig of ram vista is not that great in performance."
5,Really Good !,"this is a really great Sony product. It is light, it is fast, great screen and works very well with Windos Vista Premium. What are the ""cons"" ?.. too many trials that are not so easy to put to work or even not really cheap to buy; I took out the Norton as it was too heavy even to this equipment; I faced some problems with Adobe, as there was a trial installed and when I tried to download the Reader version, it never worked because the system called all the time the pre-installed trial version... so my recommendation; eliminate all the unacessary trials you have - there are too many - and work with what you really want. Finally, the battery life is not significant. If you plan to work unplugged, think for buying a large capicity battery VGP-BPL8.Despite this cons, I really recommend this notebook."
1,Lots of early exuberance; maybe time for reality,"There's a lot to look at with this laptop. Large screen, it's pretty, it seems to work fine. But Vista will break your heart and the graphics on this machine are not sufficient to run flight simulator (and I've got machines that seem downright scumpy and they'll run it). But it's not just hotel, road-warrior gaming. Office, all of my six-sigma stuff, just painfully slow. Oh and Sony won't even begin to talk to you about downgrading to XP. There have been any number of times where the machine just seems to lock up, a few times where the entire explorer session (files and all) go away. I'm certain this would be a great XP machine, but have no idea how to do it. Sigh. I seriously considered purchasing a Mac, and this machine makes me sorry I didn't follow my instincts."
1,Avoid Sony at all cost!,"Absolutely terrible product - bought a FZ 190e notebook in 2007. From day one the battery was problematic. Sent in for service and it came back with a note ""works to spec for specified user mode"" - translation the battery lasts 1.5 hours in normal mode. This is a brick that needs a AC adapter all the time. Also the mouse on the computer is horrible - have a Thinkpad from work and the mouse is 100x better. The only thing worse then the product is their customer service. My battery died at 14 months - guess what: the $400 warranty that I got stiffed for from Sony does not cover it. The single most defective part of their computer is not covered. BTW if you login into their site they dont have any history of purchases. So in summation: product sucks, sony website sucks, warranty sucks - I think that pretty much covers all the bases they could possibly mess up."
1,great looking but thats about it...,"An awful product. I have had this computer for over a year and have finally reached the point where I will just throw it away and get a different notebook. Key problems: 1) crashes or gets ""hung up"" incessantly, as in several times a day 2) sony does not provide the Vista disc so recoveries are difficult 3) comes preloaded with a bunch of clunky and buggy sony software 4) has known software compatibility issues with vista and finally and most importantly 5) windows vista which would be better served with the name windows vista beta. buyer beware."
5,Sony Vaio laptop,Hi Sony Vaio Laptop is sleek and easy to use..Pros: 2 GB RAM and 200 GB harddisk..more than I needCons: Processor speed is lessLaptop is worth for the price I paid..
4,Great Laptop for a reasonable price,"I just received it yesterday, so my review may need some updates later.1st - it took me couple hours to remove everything that was preinstalled on this laptop by Sony. After I removed all unwanted software, the laptop became noticeably faster.2nd - DVD drive did not work and I found some more people complaining about this issue online. I contacted Sony customer service online and they provided me with the instructions how to fix this issue (it took 5min to make some changes in the registry).Overall, I would give 5 stars, however, because of the issues mentioned above, I'm giving it 4 stars."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,"I had nothing but problems with this computer, and I would NEVER buy another SONY product after how I was treated by SONY! My Laptop got so HOT that I burnt my forearm on it, and when I called SONY, their response was... Seek an Attorney. THE NERVE! I paid 1,500.00 gor GARBAGE. it was serviced previously, and only got worse. TOO MANY PROBLEMS TO MENTION, but to add insult to injury... They wanted almost $800.00 to repair it. Yeah, and did they think I was some dummy who would pay that? I would TRASH IT FIRST! SONY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES! WARNING!!!!!! Do Not buy their Laptops!!! I know other people who have purchased different models of their Laptops, and they are all having issues or had issues with them!"
5,A great pre Island-Tuff Gong Collection,"This is one of the best collections of the early Wailers stuff. I can not recomend this CD enough if you like Bob Marley on any level. I do prefer the version of ""Thank You Lord"" on Songs of Freedom better, but thats neither here nor there. This Cd is great, with songs like ""Adam and Eve"" ""Wisdom"" (an early version of ""Stiff Necked Fools""), ""Go Tell It On The Mountain"" (with Peter Tosh on vocals, didn't hear that enough in early Wailer's music), ""Soul Rebel"", ""Run For Cover"", ""Cornerstone"", ""Small Axe"", ""Put It On"", ""Rainbow Country"", and ""I Know A Place"" just to name a few show the Wailers in prime form. A great addition to any Marley collection. Please get this album, you won't regret it. ONE LOVE"
5,BuRnIn',"OK, this album is ""Stright-Ahead"" and ""Right down the middle""..... Upright acoustic bass and rivets in the ride cymbal. If you are a Jerry Bergonzi fan, YOU NEED TO OWN THI S ALBUM. Period! Joey Caldorazzo is out of his mind on this record as well.Now, for the non-musician....... this album can be interpeted as a little frantic and noisy. However, if you are a Coltrane fan, then you would consider this good listening."
3,THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION,"It's very early in the development of COGNITIVE THERAPY. I don't need the book, but it has an historical value nonetheless."
2,"expensive, and not too great","this product may be fine for some people, but for me it was not what I expected ... nor wanted..."
2,this movie has three titles,"this movie first off, wasnt released in 2007, it was released in 1974, second, its also called ""peopletoys"" and ""the horrible house on the hill"" when i first went to watch it, i thought amazon messed up and put a completely different movie under this name...the movie itself...less then adequate"
2,Devil Times Five.,"Agree with the first post. What caught my eye was ""Sorrell Brooke"" who played BOSS HOGG on the Dukes of Hazard and died in 1994."
3,Average White Band - Oranges Speak,CD was ok. Some of the good sounds do not come through. They sound better in person.
2,A good series gone bad,"I read the first 16 or 17 Bolitho books in a hurry, 4 or 5 years ago, and enjoyed them quite a bit. Recently I picked up this one and was very disappointed. Rather than a good story of action and history, that I had come to expect from the author, this recent edition was dedicated almost entirely to Bolitho and Catherine mooning about each other and lamenting their separations."
5,A story on a romantic warmonger,"Vladimir Peniakoff was one of the greatest commandoes to come out of WWII, along with Otto Skorzeny, Claire Chennault, and David Stirling. This very readable account of his exploits in the desert and Italy show the romance of the warmonger, not only of Popski himself but off the PPA as well. The most intriguing parts of the book to me are the parts that show the craft of the warrior, like celestial navigation, trickery Sun Tzu would be proud off, and the romance of forming and leading commandoes. To anyone interested in the very beginings of desert warfare, this is a must read. Tactics formed by Bagnold and Easonsmith are still very relevant today. Plus Popski's adventures with his ""Pisspot"" give land celestial navigation a face. If you were going to read books about the ""Navy Seals"" or ""Marine Force Recon"" ect. read this one, It's very entertaining."
4,McKain's Dilemma isn't a hard-boiled detective thriller.,"Rather, it's a suspenseful tale with more than the usual measure of humanity. It's suspenseful and character-driven, and both aspects of the novel are equally absorbing.Tor has unfortunately let this one go out of print; hopefully, it's on their short list for reintroduction to the market. In the meantime, this is one worth keeping your eyes open for in used bookstores and online catalogues."
1,Overpriced!!,The replacement filter for the April Shower Oxynator is severely overpriced on this site. Which is sold by Gaiam. I found the exact same filter at my local Lowe's for only $9.99. I saved $26.00 from buying from Lowe's.
5,There is are solutions,"1) Before putting any plastic ""whimsie"" into the pond, spray with a couple of coats an ultraviolet protective spray, clear flat or gloss is your choice. I prefer the flat to the gloss to maintain the original look. These such items may need to be sprayed again periodically to maintain their color.2) Fishing line with weights on the bottom mesured to the right length and attached to the bottom of birds, ducts, etc. to allow such things to move some but not turn over and keeps them in place and upright. I drop all weights attached to such things into the center of a concrete building block placed into the bottom of the pond and this keeps such cuties in the general area of the pond of where I want them to stay.If your items have faded, you can touch them up with craft paints and then spray them with several coats of sealer that have a UV protectant."
3,Kan Dix,"This was very inexpensive. It is in my outdoor pond now. Had to make a weight to hold it upright in the water. Color is fading but, this is GA and very few things can withstand the heat. Good for the price but, would not buy another one."
3,Fast but Flawed,"I bought this to charge a couple of NP-FH70 Infolithium H batteries. If you want to just plug it in and do something else, it takes about 4 hours to do a full charge of two batteries. However, you can do a partial charge (which charges the batteries just slightly less than the full charge,) in about two hours, provided you don't mind checking on the charger and taking the battery out of slot 1 after 1 hour so the battery in slot 2 can begin its partial charge. All in all, buying a couple of travel charges would probably be a better value. To do a super fast charge with this unit you must stay with it during charging."
4,Easy to use & Informative,Quality product though a little bulky for travel. Options available with camera to charge from docking station or cord therefore this accessroy is best suited if you need to charge while using the camera or if you need more than one battery charged at a time.
4,Powerful SINGLE type charger,"darn shame sony keeps changing the style of batteries for their cameras. It just makes it so hard when you try to stay a loyal customer and you need to go get new accessories when you continue to invest in their products.Luckily i have been able to own 2 cameras that DO use the H batteries, (though i have avoided getting 1 other camera as its battery was different.)So other than that, the system is a VERY nice system. Allows for 2 charges at, comes with cables to charge in car, wall and even allows for a direct camera hook up for power (however i think it stops or slows the battery charging down).If you have a camera that uses the H batteries i would recommend this product to you."
5,Very Handy,"We bought this to keep our camcorder and spare batteries charged while on vacation. It worked fine for us, maybe because we never had to charge both batteries at the same time. But it definitely did what we were hoping it would do and did it quickly."
4,Very Informative,Very good read. Lots of information and nice charts to help you understand what you are looking at. Would recommend to others who are interested.
2,Just OK,The inside pages are clean and ok. The cover is discolored and looks like it had been in the sunshine for a long time and it also had a random sticker on it. Not impressed.
5,book recieved,"Book recieved as promised, which is more than I can say for my other independent orders I placed on amazon! This was a gift and I have not seen the book in person, but the recipient said it looked brand new and they thought I had actually ordered an unused copy! Overall, I am very pleased with the transaction. Thanks so much!"
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"I was thrilled to see that this incredible book is still around. I read it about 20 years ago and was so impressed that I gave copies to just about everyone I knew at the time. The message is worthwhile, thought-provoking and shockingly simple. Happy reading!"
3,not what i thought i ordered,"It wasn't the original book i thought i was purchasing. To love is to Be happy, was about BNK's origins of discovering Option, together with sample dialogues of most common issues challanging us as humans."
5,It works,Applied product on the bottome of wooden drawers and now they easily slide open an close. This is a good product.
5,Works great for wood on wood drawer slides,"We used this on a new dresser. The drawers were wood on wood, and had a very hard time opening. A friend recommended Sliddez, which I purchased from Amazon, now the drawers slide in and out with no issues. If the Slideez wears off after some time, there is plenty of lubricant in this can to recoat as necessary."
5,Good rear gear,"This gets an A+ rating for it's good zippers, big middle compartment and efficient design. It's made well and can take the hit when you miss the turn or slide on gravel and can't stay upright. The bag detaches from the rack easily so you can take it with you. The rack has a very adjustable fastening tab so it can fit on a variety of seat posts. I use it on my road bike for long rides. It is heavy and I would not race with it but it does carry needed gear and food for a long ride. It is a great addition to a mountain bike for trail riding."
3,"Good album, worth the price","In my opinion, very few of DR's songs are unlikeable. This album is different from most Ruffin albums, one because it's not with Motown. After listening to it a few times it's actually pretty good. If anything just recognize his ability to make something out of nothing and also his ability to sing in different keys and styles. This is a must have for die hard fans."
5,An Exhaustive and Loving Work,"Magnificent and engrossing. Maggie Lidz's book draws on a stunning array of fresh material to create a three-dimensional portrait of one of our most significant and influential families. Every page is fascinating reading. This is a patient, masterful study that at long last sets the record straight - ""All gimmicks gone."" Life at Winterthur signals a major advance in our thinking about the Du Ponts and the special place they occupy in the previous two centuries."
2,hyperbole,"circumspect, contrived and irrelevant, this book is a waste of time. significant contributions to our country and culture by various DuPonts are not contained in a substantial or edifying way. even the similarity of the first reviews herein are suspiciously reviews by one person. wouldn't surprise me at all."
3,Quirky and moderately interviewing interview transcripts,"A very random set of interviews wandering thorought topics the interviewer found interesting. The transcripts are highly colloquial and contain extensive references to fairly obscure writers, poets and philosophers. Berlin's theory of pluralism is discussed to some degree, but most of the material is him simply being asked what he thinks of this writer or that. Much of the material will be over the head of the uninitiated."
1,Full of cliches & movie stereotypes of teens,"Terribly written & acted, even my kids thought it was ludicrous. There is such a dirth of good movies for pre-teens, but here are a few of our recommendations: Penelope, Little Secrets, Whisper of the Heart, and almost any Myasaki film (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, etc)."
2,Tweens Solve a Mystery,"In this extremely light weight tween film, four girls gather to solve the mystery of sick kids appearing randomly at their private school campus. The title is actually perfect: Minor Details. This is a very minor film with very loose story-telling, the difference between well told decent literature and something just so-so. At every level, films can be told well, produced well and clean up well. This extends a 42 minute Disney hour into well over an hour and I couldn't wait for it to be through. It did not hold my interest, the characters were sleepy characterizations and the story was solved before it began."
5,GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY,"Works fine, for minor skin problems,great value for the money..16oz for just alittle more than 8oz of the same exact product from any other store I have found.Stops itching right away."
1,Tea tree oil is poisononous for dogs - beware -,Do not buy this product for dogs and cats...it is posisonous for them leading to severe sickness or even death! Please do Read the article using this link you buy this product ... [...]
1,"hot spot sprayVet's Best Hot Spot Spray, 16 oz. (Purchased on April 18",We used it on our puppy and the smell permeated the entire house. It made it uncomfortable for everyone and it dodn't help our puppy.I would not recommend it to anyone.
2,He won't let me spray him,It does help him though .whenever I can surprise him with a spray oir a wipe. I do like it.
2,"Smells great, didn't work for my dog's issue","I love that this is a natural remedy, but unfortunately my dog thought it tasted great too. I ended up having to take her to the vet to take care of her 'hot spot' issue."
4,People are idiots. Try this spray,"If you dog or cat has a hot spot this stuff is great! Don't load your pet up so that its dripping with it! And if you have to apply it to the whole animal or if the dog is biting or itching alot use and ""E"" collar. Don't let the animal lick the shit. Would you lick it? I don't wanna hear there is no warning label. You have the Internet do a little research before applying anything to you pet. And for the person said he was upset because it didn't kill the rest of the fleas on your pet. (Your an idiot). It's not meant to kill fleas. Its great to provide almost insant relief for a pet that has a raw or irritated spot. I know some people use it for poison ivy or oak relief too. Don't be afraid to use it but with anything just use responsibly don't dunk your animal is a bucket of the shit."
5,Great,"It's hard not to give Chilly a 5-star. Great Beanie Buddy, it was exactly what I was expecting. Thank you!"
1,Badly Written Version,"This story was good, but it had some very key issues with tense and time. It was structurely all wrong, shifting from past to present tense, in a book from 1250. Put that together for me, please."
2,Very Disappointing,"This book obviously reflects a beta version of FrontPage 2003- much critical information is either missing or just plain wrong. Also, it's not nearly as filled with insights and explanatory information as many similar books: often, there's nothing added to what appears in the actual program's menus and wizards. The book was poorly edited and its content flow very disjointed. Its graphics are not particularly useful. This book is simply a poorly updated version of an earlier version, obviously rushed to market to be the first out of the gate. I recommend that folks try other books."
2,not worth the money,The format is not easy to read and it is not well-organized. Many of the recipes are very similar. This is not an inspiring book.
1,The Book Title is Wrong,"The title for this book in the Amazon listing is wrong. I ordered it, and received a book with the correct ISBN. However, the title of it is ""The Pillsbury Cookbook: The All-Purpose Companion for Today's Cook"". I suspect that an Amazon employee made a data entry mistake: when typing the title for this ISBN, he typed in the wrong book title.I only browsed through this book since it is of little interest to me. However, it seems to be a standard family cookbook from the 1980's."
5,Best? opening book,"This is the bible of the opening made popular by Julian Hodgson and other young British GMs. In his hands, it fits with his slashing, attacking style.The book's 240 pages are chockful of original analysis and reveal the author's passion for this opening. There's a lot of clear explanations for lower-rated players as well as enough innovative lines that even GMs will need this book to tackle the Tromp. In fact, Jeremy Silman has called this work ""magnificent"" and described it as simply the best opening text he's ever seen.A question for me remains why the opening is so under-represented in MCO 14. It's covered in about three pages.By the way, look at Wells' other opening books too: The Complete Semi-Slave and The Complete Richter-Rauzer. According to Mr. Silman, they set the standard for those openings as well."
3,"Good Book, Bad Opening","This is an excellent book, but it ignores the fact that the trompowsky isn't fun for white after 2...d5 or the various other lines in which white plays bishop takes knight and black takes back with the g pawn. The dark squares and bishop pair will usually give black a position in which he is anything but worse. Then there's also the problem with what to play against moves like 1...d5, 1...f5, 1...e6, and 1...c6. In the latter two you could transpose to e4 openings, but then why are you playing d4? And in the first two, what do you play? Either the main lines, which you're trying to avoid by playing the trompowsky, or some system like the London or Stonewall in which your opponent can just copy your moves and draw. I don't even recommend this opening as a secondary weapon, because you must have knowledge of benoni, open sicilian, and french advance structures to play the Tromp, and that's a lot of work for a surprise opening that isn't even that good."
2,I hate ddrums,"Great chops and composition,but the use of ddrums by the drummer is like cooking with aspartame.The sound is artificial with no nuance or feelings that one gets from an acoustic set.I guess they thought it was a good idea at the time."
1,Too bad Home Again charges an annual fee to keep the chip active,"Our local vaccine clinic implanted a Home Again chip in our dog for $20 and handed me the paperwork to go online and enter all of her data. I was shocked, to say the least, that Home Again charges an annual fee to to keep the chip active. Every other chip I have ever gotten for a pet is a lifetime registration with the cost of the initial chip. I would never support Home Again in the future.... and will be registering my chip elsewhere at the end of this year. There are OTHER companies out there who will maintain your registration for a lifetime, for less than Home Again wants for one year. Do your research. Google is your friend."
1,Homeagain Ripoff,Home Again business plan appears to be to pay them $15/year when competitor Avid has only a one time fee to enter you pet in a database. Home Again is the wrong choice for a pet microchip.
1,do not get 24petwatch,"I am just warning people on the 24Petwatch microchip.If you have a rescued dog with a microchip. 24Petwatch will not cancel your registration. So, you are linked to your pet unless someone else pays money to have the registration changed.So, if you don't want to microchip your pet and your pet already has one..when they are lost they will track down the wrong owner."
1,BIG MISTAKE,"Vet administered microchip when I purchased my puppy. Did not realize until one year later when Home Again sent me my annual registration/upkeep fee of $16.99 that it had an annual fee I had to pay each year for the lifetime of the dog for the microchip to stay active if she gets lost. Since I have horses that are microchipped by AvidID.com and they do not require annual membership, I called them, and they said for a one time transfer price of $19.95 I can have it activated for life without annual fees."
2,No way to read!,"Our dog was picked up by the local Animal Control during a thunderstorm and was taken to the SPCA. (we live in a rural area) She had a Home Again Micro-chip and was registered with both Home Again and AKC. Neither the Animal Control Department nor the SPCA, DID NOT HAVE A SCANNER TO READ IT, Luckily I called the SPCA and they told me she was there and to come and get her.It is a wonderful idea if the Agency has a scanner.The AKC has a better program that is worn around the collar or you could tattoo the AKC Reg. number.I am not dissing the product it is what happens afterwords. My dogs did not have any reactions to the procedure of the implant."
2,No searchable archived database of lost pets,"HomeAgain does not maintain an archive database of missing pet's photos that volunteer PetRescuers can refer to in case a lost pet is spotted 3 or 4 months later. Who are these volunteer PetRescuers you ask. Anyone who has microchipped their pets and wishes to be added/registered on the notification list - not a representative from the company. This searchable database would be very useful to volunteer PetRescuers or anyone wishing to reunite a lost pet by inputting color, location, breed, and other specifics. Instead as a rescuer and registered pet owner of HomeAgain, I have had to use other searchable websites such as findfido, petfinder and many more, to assist me in reuniting pets. For that extra $14.99 I pay for the upgrade Proactive Pet Recovery plan, they should at least have this searchable archived database."
1,"I agree, very deceptive sales tactics.","I agree, very deceptive sales tactics. It just didn't seem correct when I read that I had to pay for an annual membership to a service that really does nothing but record your pet. After asking a number of friends they all were surprised by the recurring fee requirement as they did not have such a fee. I finally found this post warning that it is not required to continue the membership. It does appear that one must take an extra step to cancel the subscription, otherwise, HomeAgain will automatically charge your credit card next year.Go to the ACKCar.org website to register. Give them the extra 1.50 ($17.50 registration fee). I just don't trust a business that has to trick you into buying their services."
3,Second Chance,The original lamp for our X2 burned out after only 700 hours. We were very disappointed. Hopefully this lamp will live up to the rating. No place in our relatively small town carried the bulb. The Amazon store was $100 cheaper than our local chain store's e-site. The bulb arrived the same week we ordered it.
2,Poor quality costume,"I have purchased many costumes for my kids. This has to be one of the poorest made. The picture makes it look very nice. Unfortunately, the leather looking overlay is not anything like the picture. The belt is so incredibly big it fits around my 6ft4inch husband's waist. I had to cut it down and then re-do the velcro. Part of the belt even fell apart the first time it was used! Also disappointing is that I am not sure this was even new. The bag had been ripped open, breaking the snap, and taped shut again. I am sure my 6 year old will still use the costume, but I am glad this was purchased for fun dress up and not a halloween costume. It wouldn't have lasted 1 block!"
2,Cute but poorly made,"My 4-year old son loved his Jedi costume but it, as other reviewers have states, is poorly constructed of very thin material. He only wore it three times by Halloween and all the seams were ripping. One shoe covering didn't fit and the elastic to hold it on the bottom ripped away from the costume. As others have said, the belt is absolutely outsized compared to the size of the costume--we cut ours. Overall, he didn't seem to notice but he will be unable to use this costume going forward to perfect his Jedi skills--it's trashed already."
1,Fell apart the first time it was worn!,Super cute costume but fell apart before my son even made it home from his Halloween Party at school and the costume looked horrible by the time we went trick-or-treating. It tore in so many places that it cannot even be mended! Highly unlikely I will ever order from this company again.
1,Not identical to the picture,Great deception after receiving the costume. Not identical to the picture. To cheap for what I payed for. Lacking a clear explanation of what of the different sizes.
1,Very sub-par costume,"I understand that Halloween costumes tend to minimize on quality, with the assumption that kids will only wear it once. But the truth is that after Halloween (and before, for that matter!), the costumes become dress-up clothes, and they mean THE WORLD to kids.This costume is of such poor quality, I'm almost shocked. Most importantly, the belt is too large for my husband, much less my five-year-old son. And it smells of rubber so badly that even if he wanted to wear it (which he does not - despite its' 'utility belt' coolness) I'm not sure I could bear the smell.Secondly, the hole for the head is WAY too small for son's normal-sized head. We had to make a cut in the hole to enlarge it.It's really disappointing. Halloween means A LOT to kids of this age, and I just can't believe that it can be that difficult to produce a decent-quality costume for kids - who will wear it again and again."
4,Excellent,It was a present for a friend's son. Now he wears it all day!!! He is a SW fan and he was fascinated when we gave it to him.
1,Disappointed,"I live in Brazil and I bought this item to send to a friend that was coming to my city. when arrived the pants was soo big, the shirt did't fit, because can not get into the head. Excuse my english but I'm brazilian and is not my mother languague."
1,don't bother,"My son was so excited to get his Jedi costume this year for Halloween, but I wish I hadn't bought this one. the colors didn't even match the picture, the product was extremely poor."
3,flimsy!,"I got this for my 5-year-old son to wear for Halloween. The first one that was sent to us was ripped after having been worn for an hour. Amazon was great about exchanging the costume for a new one. The new one seemed to be a little better made, but started ripping after the first wearing also. My son loves to dress up in costumes over and over again, especially Star Wars ones...after only wearing it a few times it has quite a few holes. The material is very delicate and even if being extremely careful with it, it will rip. The belt is also HUGE. It almost wraps around his waist twice, but nothing a little duct tape couldn't fix. He loves the costume and it looks cute, but it's really terribly made."
3,anikin must've gained weight,The belt would've wrapped around my son twice and the boot tops wouldn't fit over his shoes. Length and width of the actual garmet was ok.
4,Anakin costume not as nice,"My 8year old liked it. I felt it wasn't as nice looking as we thought. It looked very different from the packaging and website. Belt very large, we had to do a last minute alteration.Star Wars Anakin Deluxe Child Halloween Costume (Medium)"
3,Poor quallity but lots of fun,"The fabric ripped at the first use. It was smaller than they said, but my son still had a blast wearing it."
1,Extremely unsatisfying,"I understand this is a child's costume, but as an adult making choices on behalf of our children, the item you receive should actually look like the costume. We received what we ordered, and even the product picture on the packaging looked nice..... but the actual costume was all one color - brown. There is no black like you see in the preview. It really looks awful.The belt is ridiculous. I wear size 36"" pants and I can wear the belt provided. We would have to cut up the belt and add Velcro tape to fix this for my son. I think everyone understand that not everything is going to fit perfectly but this is just a different story.My son actually wanted to look like Anakin for Halloween and not some kid with layered brown polyester tunic. I would advise to look elsewhere for Halloween."
2,Size Description Misleading,"The size small 4-6 has the wrong recommended age in the description. The Amazon description says 6-8 year olds, but when the costume actually arrived, the packaging indicated it was for 3-4 year olds. This is completely confusing as the sizing says 4-6. It was way too small for my 5 year old son, who is average height and on the slim side.For almost $30, the fabric is very flimsy and the belt looks nothing like the photo."
4,Pleased,So happy I found this costume at a resonable price...the shipping was really fast. Very much appreciated.
1,Junk,"The belt broke as soon as my son put it on. There are threads hanging from the seams, looks terrible. It is complete junk! We bought size Large for my 7 1/2 year old son & it is way too big. My fault as it said 8-10 years old on it. I thought it was size 8-10, but it was size 12-14. This is going back."
3,Beware of Wear,"My 6 year old wore the thing to death!! pajamas, to school, everyweekend over regular clothes. It is not a sturdy material."
3,"Great Price, but TOO BIG!","This is exactly what my son, a large [...], wanted for Halloween. I thought the price was really good, but was very disappointed in the size. It is WAY TOO BIG! The belt is so big I cannot even rig it to work for my son."
2,Looks nothing like the picture,"This costume looks like it has a heavy leather-like tunic and boot covers. Not even close. The belt looks nothing like the picture either and is way too big. It's supposed to attach with velcro but I have to tie it like a sash. Thankfully my son likes it anyways, but I would not have chosen this had I been able to see it in store. I really wonder weather they didn't stuff the package with something different!"
2,Not the gratest quaility,"For the price, the fabric should be a little better quality, my son loves it, but everytime he gets stuck on something the tread just pulls away, like a loose pice of hear!"
4,Very practical help!,"I found this book a year after discovering my husband had an affair. We were well on our way to healing at that time, but I wish I had had this book to help me through the first year. The affair was the most devastating thing that ever happened to me. And the only area of the book I question is the presumed guilt of the innocent spouse. At the time of his affair (and before), I was working extremely hard at the marriage and if anyone had an excuse to have an affair (based on needs) it would have been me!! Regardless though, this book has been a great stimulous to help me HELP HIM see the pitfalls that caused the problems in our marriage and how we can work at avoiding them in the future. I recommend this book to anyone facing the same situation or who has a friend in that situation."
2,This book is ok. I don't recommend it.,"Harley has a firm stance on making marriages last at all costs. Sometimes the memories can be so haunting that it may be best to move on. There are several points in the book where he tells one member of the couple what to do. This is in opposition to most (individual) counseling sessions where self exploration is key, and where the client ultimately determines what they should do. I think there are some good points in the book, and it's a quick simple read. I also don't particularly like that his theories are not backed by research. It seems like he is pulling the four rules to marital recovery out of thin air just because they may sound like they work. I recently purchased His Needs, Her needs by Harley to get a better understanding of his style but after reading this book I'm not looking forward to reading that one. Overall this book is 2 stars and I would recommend it. I hope to find better books on this subject."
4,Good Book,"This is a good book with alot of valid points. I bought it in an attempt to save my marriage after my husband left and had an affair. Unfortunately, I tried plan A, then went to plan B. Because I used Dr Harvey's plans, it pushed my husband to file divorce papers. It doesn't say in the book what to do if that happens. I'm back to square one now trying to figure out what to do to rescue my marriage from divorce and put my family back together. Dr Harvey's book is great for those who are just dealing with a partner who had an affair and hasn't left home. I am now looking for other ways of trying to save my marriage."
2,The story of John and Sue,"First I want to say the writers of the book are very knowledgable about the subject of adultery. However, my big issue with this book is that it follows mostly 1 couple's affair (another one is talked about) THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE BOOK. Both give examples of an extremely difficult situation to over come, the other not so difficult. This is a good contrast I guess, but for me, my wayward spouses affair/situation was right in the middle. A few things I read made me feel as though it would be impossible to get past my own husband's affair. I do think it has some good tools to use, meaning having all your ""love banks"" filled. With that said, there were times I just couldn't wrap my brain around getting over the affair then having to do all this work? It is probably best if one reads this book when away from the situation and a little more over the affair. But for me, I got very tired of reading over and over about ""John and Sue's"" situation....continually throughout the book."
4,good book,"The book was good, marriage not so good. No complaints with book. It did help me thru this heart wretching time."
5,Surviving an Affair,"This book should be required reading for all people who are married or even contemplating getting married. It was surprising - but I can see where it is true - that these authors who are seasoned counselors - say that every marriage has a great possibility of experiencing an affair. So, if you don't want to go through that pain - read this book. If you have been told by your marriage partner that he/she is leaving you, and/or asking for a divorce, and/or just needs to get away to think, it is very possible that that partner is already in an affair. READ THIS BOOK. It may help you survive the affair, or at very least, let you know what to expect in the days ahead.READ THIS BOOK!"
3,"Somewhat Useful, But Not Realistic","This book offers some useful advice about coping with a spouse's affair, and is easy-to-read. However, I disagree with a lot of the authors' approach. One of their recommendations for ""affair-proofing"" a marriage (a concept I don't believe in) is to spend every waking moment together. That's not realistic for most people; everyone needs alone time, and a lot of couples don't share enough interests to make this idea work. And the whole notion of ""drop an activity if your partner doesn't want to share it with you"" is ludicrous. I also object to their case studies, which are entirely too tidy and orderly to be drawn from real life. The most useful part is the Marital Recovery Agreement in the index, which makes you stop and think about how you treat your partner and how they treat you. If the two of you can't manage the basic kindness and consideration in the agreement, it's a big sign that things aren't going to work."
2,forget personal trainer,"First off I have to say that I have used exam cram to pass my last 3 exams so I know that they are very useful.The problem I have is not with the book but with the personal trainer part which to me seems like nothing more than an electronic version of everything that is in the book.It goes chapter to chapter along with the book ,The only thing good about it was the test questions.They should have offered the book with a disk of tests not with the same thing I just read."
4,Dating your piece,Is there a section in the book that shows the various Ohio Art logos and the dates they were used?
5,Ohio Art: The World of Toys,"Great book, Tons of full color photos. A must for the avid collector. A great book to display with your colection."
3,See my review on their similar model,"See my review (if the item is still available), on the Pelican black FLASHLIGHT...which seems to be the same product."
3,In a pinch,"This small easy to read booklet contains the basics you will need if you come across an injured or orphaned bird. Some of the information is redundant, like the constant reminder that you're not qualified to do this so call a rehabilitator. There is also a section on large birds such eagles, which probably isn't relevant. But overall it does give you what it promises, the basics the keep a bird alive until you can get it to help."
1,Terrible!,"This monitor was terrible! Even with the volume turned all the way up both on the child receiver and the parent receiver, I still couldn't hear my son. Sometimes I would hear him crying from the other room but couldn't hear him on the monitor! Useless! I liked the light show so we bought the FisherPrice Flutter Bye Crib Attachment, which has a light show, and then traded this monitor in for the Fisher Price 900mhz monitor which has crystal clear reception."
1,LOUSY MONITOR,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO BE USED AS A BABY MONITOR. I HAVE TRIED TWO OUT AND THEY ARE BOTH WORTHLESS. YOU CAN NOT HEAR YOUR BABY THROUGH IT, WHICH DEFEATS THE PURPOSE.I GAVE IT ONE STAR FOR THE COLORFUL LIGHT SHOW THAT IS CUTE. BUT AS A MONITOR FORGET IT. FISHER PRICE WILL NEED TO REMAKE THIS IN ORDER FOR CUSTOMERS TO WANT IT. THE LIGHTS AND SOUNDS MONITOR IS LESS EXPENSIVE AND OF MUCH BETTER QUALITY."
1,Does not work!,"Absolutely can not hear my baby. My husband even yelled into it from another room and I could not hear him on the monitor. The automatic feature really does not work. The light show is good, but only stays on for a few minutes (then will not turn back on to crying because the automatic feature, as I mentioned does not work). DON'T BUY THIS!"
2,Bad choice,"Our son loves the lights and music, but the monitor is not a good product. It has static feedback on both channels at any volume level and the noise activation system does not work unless you stand over it and shout."
1,Definitely not recommended,The main reason we liked this monitor was for the light show. This light stopped working when my daughter was 5 weeks old! And there is tons of static and buzzing. Definitely not worth the money!
1,I agree!!,This monitor is horrible and should be recalled. You can not hear your baby crying and the light show does not come on with moderate noise.
3,Just ok,"No problems with the monitor (although the sound quality isn't perfect, but who needs crystal-clear baby crying?) The projector, on the other hand, has issues. The bulb died after 6 or 7 months and finding a replacement locally is difficult. Also, the design stopped rotating - I took it apart and found that a pulley popped off the motor. Not sure if it will work right with the correct bulb, but right now the bulb will not shut off when it is supposed to."
3,"the projector does not ""break"", the light bulb burns out",I actually never used it as a monitor so I can not comment on that. The light show is great- but the projector light bulb does burn out frequently-you just have to replace it. I like the fact that the show and music played for a long time and you do not have to keep turning on for your child.
2,light show ended at 8 months...,"We never used it as a monitor because the reception was awful. However, the light show and music was great! Until it stopped at 8 months. I called FP and they are sending a lightbulb replacement as a curtesy, Whoopie...they only last approx. 15 hours. Not worth taking it apart constantly to replace the bulb."
3,Aquarium Monitor with Smart Response,"i got this as a baby shower present. after 2-3 months of using it, the projector stopped working. oh well.. i'll just use it as a baby monitor."
4,Great concept but bulb life is horrible!,"We bought this monitor for the light show only. Our son loves it. He falls asleep to the show every night. The bad thing is the bulb only lasts for about 1 1/2 months if used every night. We went to find another bulb and they don't sell them at Babies R Us, Home Depot or Lowes!! We had to go see an actual guy called The Bulbman for this particular bulb (P12 bulb) So now every 1 1/2 months I have to take it apart (not fun) and replace the bulb. Most parents take it back for another monitor when the bulb burns out and Babies R Us will give you another one (I did that twice before I learned the bulb was out.) But the first night the bulb burned out and he couldn't fall asleep to his show was not a fun night! So be warned that the bulb life is not long on this monitor so have some spares handy!"
1,Great concept but a huge waste of time and money.,"I bought this for my 6th child thinking what a great idea, something that will respond to the baby crying and allow me to hear at the same time. What a joke I have only had it for about 5 weeks and the light show died after 3 weeks, it would shine but not turn now the bulb is dead as well. Good old customer support says you must have the monitor in hand in order to troubleshoot the problem. Just what I have time for standing around holding the monitor while juggling an infant and dealing with a 2,4 and 6 year old. Don't bother with this product Great concept but a huge waste of time and money."
3,"I like this monitor, but it does have its setbacks.","Unlike other reviewers, I have no problem hearing my son cry through the receiver. The light show is nice and the music is nice too (its the same music as the other Ocean Wonders products).The problems I have with this monitor, though, are somewhat the same as the other reviewers' problems.First off, the ""automatic"" light show does not work unless you're standing over the thing and shouting into it. I have it turned all the way up to the most ""sensitive"" level, and it still doesn't work.Also, the lightbulb for the ""light show"" burnt out well before it should have. I found a new bulb for it, but this bulb burnt out WAY sooner than the last one (only after 3 uses). I'm not impressed with that.Other than that, the monitor does what its supposed to: monitor the baby.If you want a monitor that actually does have a nice light show and an automatic feature, I'd find a different monitor."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Even though I had read poor reviews of this monitor, I was determined to buy it since it matched my theme. I figured that my experience would be different. Unfortunately, it wasn't! If you love listening to FUZZ, then this is the monitor for you! It's actually hard to hear what my baby is doing over the fuzz! If I could do it all over again, I'd listen to the reviews & buy one that was proven to work well for my baby!"
2,Not what I expected!!!!,"I wanted this monitor because of the fact that it said it was sound activated. When my baby cries the music is suppose to start and the light show is supposed to turn on. I put it to the test before I put my baby in the crib. I stood at the location of the crib and made a few noises.........it didn't activate it. I stood closer to it and made some more noises and it still didn't work. I have yet to see this function work on our monitor. I don't have the other problems as far as not hearing our baby in the monitor. The sounds are not clear, but I can hear her!"
1,This monitor is horrible!,"I am incredibly disappointed in this monitor. The only good thing about this monitor is the light show. The reception on the receiver is horrible. We can't hear our baby unless he's screaming and even then its hard to hear. Plus all we hear is static. It doesn't matter what channel its on or where its positioned in the house, static is the only thing that comes through! I would not recommend this monitor to anyone."
1,disappointed,"I was disappointed to find that this name brand item was such a dud. I COULD NOT HEAR MY BABY, which defeats the purpose of a monitor. I didn't have any bulb or battery problems, as others did. Every time my baby cried, the monitor did not go on, which is one of the features I was seriously looking foward to. The only nice feature is the pretty fish projection and sounds. Since I already threw out the box, I cannot return it, so I will use the projector feature. along with purchasing another monitor."
1,Not Worth Buying,I bought this thinking I could tackle 2 things at once (the light show and a monitor). I was wrong. The light show is great but the monitor does not work well. You can barely hear if the baby is making any noise and that is with the transmitter and receiver volumes all the way up. I do not recommend it at all.
2,Horrible Monitor!,"This monitor was terrible! I could barely hear the baby when the volume was turned all the way up. My 5-year old daughter actually woke me up one night to tell me the baby was crying (her room is right next door to the baby), all I could hear from the monitor was the constant ""buzz""! The very next day I returned the monitor and bought the Fisher-Price Private Connection 900 MHz. I love it! It has crystal clear reception and it even comes with rechargeable batteries!!"
1,AWFUL!!!,I BOUGHT THIS MONITOR THINKING MY DAUGHTER WOULD LOVE THE LIGHT SHOW AND SHE WAS ACTUALLY SCARED OF IT- EVERYTIME I TURNED IT ON SHE WOULD START CRYING!!! THE STATIC ON THIS MONITOR IS AWFUL!! YOU CANNOT EVEN HEAR YOUR BABY CRYING!! I HAVE TRIED TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL AND IT JUST GETS WORSE AND MY ROOM IS RIGHT NEXT TO HERS- YOU WOULD THINK I WOULD HAVE ULTRA CLEAR RECEPTION! NO WONDER THIS MONITOR WAS ON CLEARANCE!!!
1,Flakey and Poorly Made,This thing is not well made in our opinion. First the power supply for the reciever went bad.The the projector would start going on and off in the middle of the night waking and scaring our child.In fact Im tossing it in the trash today.
1,Disapointed!,"I am so disapointed in this item. I love the fish projection & music, but the monitor itself is horrible. I hear the baby screaming from his room, but do not hear him through the monitor. No matter what we do the moniter buzzes. I am taking this back!"
3,Great light show,"I live in an apartment, so the only time I rely on this for listening is if I'm in the shower. I agree with other reviewers that the sound is very weak. Fortunately, I use it more for the light show, sound affects and I like the fact that it goes off automatically when my daughter cries, which goes off as soon as she starts to whimper. If I relied on this monitor more, I would be less satisfied, but for me it has worked out well.Do not purchase if you will be out of hearing range from your child."
1,HORRIBLE....DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$,"We bought this monitor for our 5 1/2 month old almost 2 months ago. She Loved the fish projection!! However, we could never hear her when we were downstairs. We could hear her better down the stairs than we could over the monitor. Then the projection went out. I changed the lightbulb and nothing! I took it back and am now looking for another monitor with the same concept. Not worth the $$ at all!!!"
3,not much to it,pretty boring book. i couldn't really get into it. it didn't have all that much to say. maybe it was too subtle and i didn't get it. john cage fans may like it though.
3,Interesting,I don't recall what I was expecting when I ordered this. I heard it on a local jazz station. I like his music.
5,"If you remember Vietnam, this book is important.","This is a very powerful book about a unique group of people--a small but important part of the Vietnam War's history. These women journalists share an honest, deep perspective with the reader. It is a very moving and powerful narrative. I personally was very touched; I am an American woman who lived in Saigon in 1973, and ""War Torn"" brought the memories back--the happy as well as horrible."
3,Its ok but i would not recomend it,"This book was ok but I would not recomend it.Bradford Angeir is not that great of a writer, so there are many parts that are hard to understand.But if you have time on your hands and want to know about the baics of wilderness survival it is preaty good."
5,a fabulous base for exploring...,"my father gave me his copy of this book when i was in college. he was a camp director in his youth and while times were different then (they taught kids how to 'live off the land' by catching their own dinner) i am still able to share many of this books teaching with my own campers in today's much reserved society.angier has found a balance of the science of each topic mixed with easy to use tips or diagrams (although limited in the old copy that i have) so he connects with people who learn in different ways.this book gets you excited about exploring the wilderness and trying new things rather than leaning on one style. i will be passing this book onto my nephews or niece when they're ready, too! it crosses curious generations that easily..."
2,I've read better survival books,"I've read all his survival books, and they are all pretty much the same. Besides being redundant, he's a poor writer, so his writing is often difficult to understand.Aside from that, the book has some merit. It contains many tidbits of valuable information, as the author does know his stuff.However, I would highly recommend that one browse through the book before buying it."
2,How to stay alive in the woods,Pretty general in nature and not specific enough to be of any value. Any Boy Scout learns more about survival in his early years than is told in this book. As far as I am concerned this is a waste of time in reading. It has just enough information to make a person dangerous to themselves in any life threatening situation.
1,NOT the survival book for you!!,"This book is NOT the one you should pick, regardless of your background. For the inexperienced suburban/urban wilderness lover, it has some outdated info and simply isn't that useful without any pictures. For the more experienced survivalist, the packaging alone will be enough to turn you off (a bit too ""Martha Stewart meets the woods""), not to mention the overly-simplified approach it takes to basic survivalist skills. As someone who has spent time on a mountain rescue crew, I can attest to the role books such as this play in getting people WAY over the heads in the great outdoors. If you insist on getting a survival manual, keep looking."
3,How to Stay Alive in the Woods,"Having read an earlier book by Mr. Angier many years ago I looked forward to a revised and updated version of the tips offered decades ago. Unfortunately I was dissapointed. While many things have not changed in the wilderness, clothing, emergency suplies, and first aid techniques certainly have. Saying that only wool is good enough to keep one warm and to advocate the outdated use of snake bite kits and iodine are examples. I suggest that today's survivalist look for a more modern guide."
4,End of the world prep?,"Naw, just knowledge to know if I'm ever lost in the woods or stranded in my car in the woods. Good info"
3,works well,"The charger works great. It charges quickly and when it's done it changes to green. The only problem with it is that if you play the unit while charging you get a buzz in the background. With the twenty hour battery life of the Nano It's not that big a deal. I just plug the Ipod in while I am away from the car, and unplug it for playback"
3,"Works fine as an adapter, not so good as a charger.","I seem to have the opposite experience as the previous reviewer. This ""charger"" does not seem to charge my iPod Mini much at all. No matter how low the battery is, the indicator light on the charger almost always glows green when it is connected. I rarely ever see the amber color that indicates charging. The iPod will often lose power soon after removing it from this charger. This does not happen when I use the wall adapter to charge it.But as for playing the iPod while it is plugged in the car, I have had no problems at all. The main reason I own this is to play the iPod in the car, and it works just fine for that."
1,New-age mush,"This album should be classified as new-age rather than World Music. The African elements are overshadowed by slick Western production values and a relentless desire to please. The lyrics are pretentious and self-indulgent; the music so ""soothing"" that I wanted to throw it out the window. What is this supposed to be? Music for the Lite-FM crowd? Background filler for the dentist's office? A Disneyland version of Africa? Anyone contemplating buying this album would be much better served by trying Rokia Traore, Remmie Ongala or Baba Maal."
4,Very strong CD,"This is a very good example of world music; Oryema has integrity and his music is both fraught with feeling and charged with the masculine strength of African beats and rhythms. Perhaps no better example of this exists anywhere than in the opening track ""The River,"" which offers gripping backup vocals and a powerful sense of place. The entire CD follows up well, particularly with the moving ""Hard Labor"" that touches effectively on the various walks of life in a damaged African society. An exile from Uganda, Oryema displays a greater sense of time and place than most Western musicians. this one is a hands-down winner, and I will be buying more of Oryema's work."
5,Unbelievably cool piece of art it is,"I really dig this music, J. Hellborg is one of the best and most original bass players of this era. On this album he plays with G. Velez, percussionist and overtone singer. The album and track titles may sound rather bombastic (or meaningless) for the non-inititated eye, while after a decent listening you certainly get the point. One would hardly think that a duet of a single percussion and a bass can give such an ease of mind."
1,Hard rocks of pork,This wasn't crackli'n it was more like Rockli'n. Every bag was full of rocks of pork rinds. I literally chipped a tooth eating this. Avoid it....it's not worth $0.50 out of a vending machine. Low quality.
1,uch,"this product is very, very, very salty and has a mushy texture to one side plus it tastes burnt - refund."
4,A Nice Push to Put You to Sleep,"This product does what it states. It gives your body the slight push it needs to fall asleep when you're having trouble. I like the sublingual tablets because they seem to work faster than the traditional pills you swallow and they have a pleasant orange flavor. My only gripe is that they don't dissolve as easily as other sublingual tablets I've taken. These require you to move them around under your tongue to get them to dissolve. Others I've taken dissolve quicker without manipulation under your tongue. Still, this won't stop me from buying these again. They do what they're supposed to and the price is very reasonable."
2,"Wrong toy, but good customer service","Originally I thought this toy was the larger version because that was how it was labeled. When it arrived though, it was the smaller version from the McDonald's Happy Meal. The seller refunded the money in full and also apologized for the mix-up. If you want the smaller version then this is the toy for you, but if you want the larger one keep looking!"
5,This cat means the world to my daughter.,"I got this beanie buddy as a teenager because I like cats. I kept it around. When my daughter was 18 months she fell in love with it. It has been her favorite stuffed animal ever since. She named her Mama kitty and sleeps with her every night. It's also been through the washing machine at least once a month, sometimes more. So far it has held up, although she doesn't have hardly any whiskers left. I'm on here buying her a replacement Mama kitty, if hers ever goes missing. Plus she starts daycare in the fall and I want her to have one for school. I'm just not sure if she will take the new Mama kitty, since there will be obvious differences."
5,Chip,"We have Chip and she is so cute!! We dress her up in doll clothes and call her dress up cat. She is a flat, simply made beanie and she is CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good recording of an average work,"I've seen Mariella Devia perform this role and she has a wonderful controlled voice with perfect technique coupled with jeweled accuracy,pity we aren't given the pleasure of hearing on CD the many high E flats that were given with spot on brilliance live,however she is withoutdoubt the main reason for deciding to purchase this recording,Chamonix has some beautiful music but cannot match Donizetti's best works,his genius coming through only spasmodically,the rest of the cast are more than adequate,Bellini the conducter shows too much reserve at times but generally judges the change of moods well and the playing of the orchestra is solid."
1,Don't even think of ordering from this outfit!,"The drill advertised as 18 Volt, came through with 18 Volt stickers/labels on it but didn't have the weight I expected. I looked at the charger and it said ""9 Volt Only"" so I checked the battery pack. It said 18 Volt, but I cheated and opened it up. Only 9 Volt worth of batteries in it. This company falsly advertised this product as an 18 Volt drill, when I tried to send it back I couldn't get in touch with anyone. If I weren't in Afghanistan, I'd sue somebody. What a rip-off!"
1,a con!,"So called 18v drill turned out to have only 7.2v of batteries, a 7.2v motor and charger. Box and drill are labelled 18v but be warned all you will get is a 7.2v drill ie useless."
2,Okay but not great,"I purchased the Boston Cordless Drill about 2 years ago and I can say I probably used it 4 times, the drill does not power fully and I have to keep charging the drill every few minutes which is a pain in th @ss. I didnt pay alot for it so I am not upset just a little frustrated when I need to do my projects around the house."
5,Fat Is Not Your Fate,"Unbelievable! I love the science behind their book & the idea you can tailor your own nutritional plan to your genetic makeup. Reaching & maintaining your goal weight is nothing but fun and my friend has already done just that. With the step-by-step guidelines for a phenotype E (emotional eater) she has lost the unwanted pounds - all of them! She then learned about make-up, changed her hair style & bought a whole new wardrobe. The results are stunning! But in addition to the physical changes the psychological changes are endearing. She is so happy. She is a true testimonial to Fat Is Not Your Fate. For me the fabulous recipes are my favorite section of their book."
1,Too many typos. Find a better version.,"I was incredibly excited to finally get a copy of this book, and started reading it as soon as it arrived.The problem I have with this book is not in content, but in spelling... There are SO MANY misspelled words.The publisher is someone called Really Simple Media and supposedly has reprinted the original book exactly as it was by Mr Hopkins. To me, it appears they scanned the original work and did OCR, because some words don't even make sense in the sentence.The current publisher of this book must have changed something. I find it unbelievable that a person in the ad business would so carelessly edit a work with his own name on the cover, and even more unbelievable that generations of advertisers would recommend this book to their colleagues.There are other reviewers who make the same observation in their reviews."
3,A quick read on advertising,"I enjoyed the read. Hopkins presents interesting ideas with the boiled down simplicity of another time. His lessons can easily be applied to modern concepts. However, someone would do well to write Scientific Advertising 2.0 and modernize some of his dated examples and assumptions. Not the book's fault, that's what happens when you buy a 90 year old text!Only complaint, the editor!"
3,Just a material for researchers of advertising history,"I think that usual advertising people have nothing to do with this book. It's useful for those who study advertising evolution, history etc.Most of his points are timeless, but it isn't a MUST READ"
1,Total rip-off,"You would think when ordering a CO2 powered air gun that the gun would accept a CO2 cartridge, right? This gun does not accept CO2 cartridges. It came with no instructions, no schematics, no receipt...just an ornamental gun in a box.If this is what the manufacturer considers an air gun then you should avoid this manufacturer. This useless gun is going back!"
2,Ick.,"Well, this was a real disappointment.What we have here is a cd that is mostly a gentleman reading a fair-quality essay about Lenny Bruce, interspersed with some recordings of Lenny and recordings of interviews with others about Lenny.The recordings are all OBVIOUSLY taken from old vinyl records, with lots of scratches. That's right, that means that there is no new material to be found here. I also wonder if all the rights for these recordings were arranged.The brief Lenny snippets don't often even go with the essay being read, and the whole pile of slop has some attempted important-sounding synth music added in.It is not a fun listen. I do not recommend it, except for completists."
5,Intro to Louie Lamour,Louie Lamour's first book..and is a great introduction to his novels. Brings Europe around 1200 to life! I highly recommend it!
3,Walking Drum,"I lkie it, but it must be an early book because his transitions are really rough. I find myself going back thinking I missed a page or paragraph. As usual, Louis L'Amour has done his research but the main character's adventures seem a bit far fetched. If you like adventure and wanta taste of the life and time in 1170, then it is fun."
3,Not accurate history but worth a read.,"I love the history in this book, unfortunately it is not all accurate. L'amour has the Moors using scimitars which didn't come into use by the Muslims until the Mongol invasions about 50 years later than the date the book takes place. He calls the land of the Franks Gaul like the Roman empire was still around. Kerbouchard knows quite a bit about the ancient Egyptians, but people then knew next to nothing about them, thinking Genies responsible for the pyramids. He depicts the Moorish women as having more freedom than that of the Franks, the exact opposite was true. The story is repetitive with a damsel and arch villian in each adventure. All that being said it is worth a read. Also recommended is his best western ""Conagher""."
5,A great book no matter how many times you read it!!,"I've been a Louis L'Amour fan for as long as I can remember having favorite authors. The Walking Drum, although it isn't a western, is vintage L'Amour. His attention to character developement, historical and geographical accuracy, and good old fashioned story telling makes this one of the best novels he's ever written. Anyone interested in suspense, adventure, romance, and wit will have a great time with this book!!"
4,Very enjoyable reading,"I love adventure stories, and this is a good one. I did not understand all the historical background but enjoyed the book anyway. L'Amour knows his westerns, but he definitely did a lot of research to write this book as well. I've also read Last of the Breed which is excellent.In the ""Author's Note"" at the end of the book, which was written in 1984, L'Amour notes that in school we are taught little of China, India and the Moslem world, but ""they are now powers with which we must deal both today and tomorrow, and which it would be well for us to understand."" He called that one right."
2,too long,"walking drum is way too long, i mean i had to read it for required reading for my school and it was painful how long it took... kind of predictable and cliched too, which didn't help it's cause...."
1,I was made to read this book for history class,"this book in my opinion is simply horrid. i usually adore reading, and have probably thousands of books in my home. If action and romance are all you want, then this book can supply short intervals of that. If you are more of a person who treasures symbolism and learning about human nature, then this book will utterly bore you."
2,James Bond in the 12th Century,"I just finished ""The Walking Drum"" - I have been reading all the L'Amour books I can find, and this one disappointed me.I enjoyed the change of scenery from the typical L'Amour' American West setting to one in far off Asia, but found the book to be too cliched and and the plot simply unbelievable. The hero is just too handsome and heroic, and the events too full of convenient coincidences, busty babes and wondrous escapes.I felt that L'Amour wrote this book as a pot boiler to earn cash rather than as serious work of historical fiction. If you really want an engrossing read, try Bernard Cornwell's ""The Archer's Tale"" trilogy, which takes place a couple of centuries later."
4,A complicated epic,There is many different places and characters that the main character encounters on his journey. Most of them have long and unpronounceable names. I recommend if you read this book to keep a pad of sticky notes and write down important characters and places in the book. This book is a very informational book that captures your magination and keeps you yearning to read more.
5,A wonderful book!!,"A trip through Spain and western Aisa of near 1,000 years ago. The main character is engaging and a man of character and purpose. I wish there were more books in this series. I think it is one of Loius' very best works and if you know L'amour then you know that is saying a LOT. Louis wrote mostly western and early American novels. Of course those are very good too, especially the first few books in the Sacketts series. This is a book not to be missed. I bought it at a used book sale from the local public library... why they would sell such a reat work is beyond me but I am glad they did. I sat on my Kindle one too many times and broke the screen. Once I got my new Paperwhite I bought this book for Kindle. I was about 1/3 through with it, I finished it on the Kindle. I am very pleased with the Paperwhite too! I am now reading LAST OF THE BREED. I heard of it while reading reviews of this book... it is another book not to be missed! So long for now... and happy reading!"
5,One of my favourite books,"I first read this book about twenty years ago, when I was in highschool. I since have reread it at least a dozen times andits still hard to put down once you start reading it."
2,"IF REPETION IS THE LAW OF ABIDING IMPRESSIONS, THEN....","I love Louis L'amour westerns and I had great hopes that this non-western ""WALKING DRUM"" would equal the excellence of his westerns--and it did for several chapters. After awhile, however, the book became so repetitive that you could anticipate what would happen next. I gave the book 2 stars only because it did keep my interest for a few chapters."
5,Great read again & again !,"I have always been a big fan of Louis Lamour. Out of all of his books this one I consider one of his best. Re-read it every so often & every time once you start it, it'shard to put down."
4,typical book of that era,I enjoyed this book but it was very easy to see that it was written some time ago. I was worth reading for the history that was revealed.
4,A journey with The Walking Drum by Louis L'Amour,"This is the first book I have ever read by Louis L'Amour and it is fascinating! I thought he wrote only westerns so it really surprised me to find this historical novel which takes place in the 12th century and provides a learning experience about that era. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction. It takes a while to become accustomed to the high flying prose, but the details provided well compensate for that writing style."
5,outstanding,I read this book as a high school requirement but remembered little about it. It is a nonstop adventure and one l'll likely read again.
4,A FUN historic-fiction,"My father read this book to my sister and I when I was about ten, so naturally I have a lot of sentimental attachment to the romantic hero, Mathurin Kerbouchard, and his quest. The book also sparked an interest in medieval European and imperial Arab history, before I even entered high school. I re-read this book every-so-often, and find Kebouchard's adventures don't get tiresome with repetition."
5,Louis L'Amour's masterwork,"This book is, without a doubt, Louis L'Amour's crowning achievement. Kerbouchard is the classic adventurer. ""The Walking Drum"" is one of the greatest pieces of fiction you will ever read. ""The Walking Drum"" defies description...I can only say that I actually cheered when I finished it.Louis L'Amour was working on the sequel when he died...such a shame that we had to lose such a great fiction writer."
4,A novel set in the Middle Ages,Tends to run on with some repetition.. I don't consider this one of his best.. but I find the history extremely interesting
2,It hurts me to be this hard on Mr. L'Amour,"I have read at least 40 L'Amour books and this is by far his worst. ALthough an interesting setting and a nice change for Mr. L'Amour, the character was most annoying. He spent the majority of the book talking about how great he was and how smart he was and how smart people keep their mouth shut. Every single person the character met he ends up saying something that makes the person want to kill him. By the end of the book, there's about 4,000 people who want to kill him. I couldn't stand reading this book. It hurts me to be this hard on Mr. L'Amour, but this book was horrible."
2,Reading About Weddings Can Be Murder,"This is the first book I have read in this series. I thought I'd really like it, but I was extremely disappointed. It was dull and predictable. The vocabulary seemed odd like a person from other than the gold coast was speaking. Either the vocabualry was overworked or the author is British. It just didn't fit with the setting.After reading other reviews, I am not giving up on the series, (I have already bought 3 others)Maybe the rest will be better."
3,Silly,"I usually enjoy this series a lot, but this installment just didn't do it for me.Helen just took up with Phil in the last book, and already they're declaring their undying love for each other. Not once, but twice, Helen jumps to the wrong conclusion about Phil and his ex-wife and comes off as near-suicidal. It was just way too much too soon after the start of the romance.I also thought the plot was weak. Mother of the bride deaths are being done way too much lately. The characters come across as one-dimensional and unlikeable. Add that to a thin plot and this just wasn't as enjoyable as other installments of the series."
4,Excellent reading!,"These lite-mystery series books are a delightful change of pace from the usual books I read. This book moved along swiftly with just the right balance of intrigue and humor. I really enjoyed this story, felt sorry for Desiree, and did not figure out the crime until the solution was revealed!"
1,Reader might be fine but avoid HomeAgain,"We just bought a dog that had been chipped. All I can tell you is that I registered the chip with HomeAgain. Then I got an email telling me that I need to register my dog. It had the right email (came to me), had the right name for the dog but a completely different chip number. I contacted HomeAgain and the customer service person didn't seem surprised or overly concerned. I called the pet store where I bought the dog. The owner talked to the owner of HomeAgain and was assured that it was just a 'glitch' and it had been corrected.Folks, tying your pets microchip number to you is the only reason for their existence. If they can't do that, they are useless.The chips are probably fine but their software is apparently buggy and can't be trusted. When our puppy is neutered, we will have this chip removed and an AVID chip implanted.If I could give this product a 0 star rating, I would."
4,"Decent, but fundamental product problems","the book arrived in perfect condition from the seller. There are a few organizational issues that are easily resolved (the placement of words starting in eth, etc). not all words and meanings are there, so if you have a glossary for a text you're working on in practice, use it in coordination."
3,not bad for the price,"The dictionary is helpful if the words you are looking for are listed. I understand that to have a dictionary of every version of the old english language is not feasible but why list a word with a ""see [such and such a word]"" if the word you are trying to see is not listed?"
3,A good dictionary,"The Clark Hall's work is good indeed and it is the reference in Old English dictionaries, including every word you may find in an Anglosaxon text. It's quite exhaustive and there are also many dialectal forms of some words.The main problem is that every dental fricative sound is transcribed as , no matter what was it's real accurate pronunciation originally. I mean, it'd have been great if the author would have used (thorn) for voiceless fricative and (eth) for the voiced one."
4,"Good book, idiotic review","This book does a good job of bringing together a lexicon of Old English words. Other than screwing up the thorn/eth thing that another reviewer commented on, it did just fine.As an aside, the previous review is just incredibly stupid. This is a language dictionary, and is obviously very much like a Spanish-English dictionary, not like the OED. On top of that, Old English is a dead language, why do you need the pronunciation so badly? Let me know next time you have a conversation with King and Saint Alfred the Great or the Venerable Bede."
4,A handy resource,"I was taking a course in Old English last year and bought the dictionary for that. I find this dictionary is better than the Bosworth Toller, which often has definitions in Latin. This particular dictionary is very helpful for translating Beowulf. Course, if you can afford it, access to the Old English Dictionary they are compiling at University of Toronto might be better but I find this one adequate and very handy."
1,Tresure Island Review,"In my opinion, I think that it was a very poor book. I did not think that it got to details clearly, I thought that they jumped around alot. I got the feeling that it was leaving out parts, and nto getting directly to the point. I guess that I am just used to reading love stories, and not adventure stories.I love to read, but when I was reading this, I was not interested, and my mind wondered instead of actually getting into the book. I just thought that it was written poor, and not exactly thought about clearly. That is just my opinion though, I did not like Treasure Island, I thought that it was very uninteresting. That is just my opinion though, no one has to listen to it."
5,"Unique, soothing to the spirit","Lindsey Collier has created a unique book from a set of experiences that sooner or later will bind us all together--love, loss, grieving. And he stretches for a glimpse of the road that leads from there....In Jan's Rainbow, he takes the risk (and takes the reader along in that same risk) to tell with candor, humor and vulnerability about the loss of his wife of forty years to ovarian cancer. The book contains timely quotes, examples and advice that are thoughtful and soothing in times of loss.In addition to the uplifting story of Jan's rainbow and its impact on Lindsey and his family, he has included stories by other everyday people about their experiences as well. But most of all, it's a great love story...."
2,Not as good as expected,"this book was recommended by the facilitator of our bereavement group and I thought the author's experiences and advise was pretty good but the stories he included from other people (about 3/4 of the book) were a little far fetched, unrealistic and poorly written; there are many other books out there that are much better and helpful"
4,Good product (with some minor flaws),"So, i decided to buy this Trilogy. Is a very good product but it has some flaws:- ROBOCOP: The image quality is very dissapointing for a BluRay movie. I bought the Alien Anthology and the Rocky Collection with this and, for example, Alien (wich is an older movie than Robocop) has a much better image quality and crisp colors in comparison.- ROBOCOP 2: An improvement over the first movie. The sound quality is better also.- ROBOCOP 3: Ditto."
4,RoboCop Trilogy [Blu-ray],Very Good all three the Fist one is Always the Best One. The Story is all in the city of Detroit.
3,One movie too many,"If I were to review each movie individually: Robocop 1 would get 5 stars for the sci-fi story line and the use of comedy. Robocop 2 was a good attempt to recapture the fun in the first movie but falls short with the moral drum beating about the sins of drugs. Robocop 2 gets 4 stars. Robocop 3 is why I called this review - one movie too many. This movie at best is only a 2 star movie. That is why I give the box set only a 3. If it would have left the third movie out and instead gave a disc of more special features, this could have been easily a 5 star set"
3,"Hit, Hit, Plop. As in Cow-Plop.",The first two Robocop movies were outstanding sci-fi/action adventure films. Which is why I couldn't believe a 3rd film had been made that I had never heard of. Now I can only wish that I had still never heard of it. The third instsallment is so badly written and so poorly done that it taints the first two films.
4,Peter Weller + Robocop = Freaking Awesome Movies,"What more can you say, than Aside from Terminator, Robocop is another Badass to the Action Movie scene. Peter Weller Never lets you down as Alex Murphy, he totally nails the character and Now Icon that is Robo. Laugh and cheer on his performances as the metallic Cop from OCP in the crisp and excellent quality of Blu Ray. This Trilogy is worth the price even if Robocop Part 3 was a let down."
3,Still can be better,"I love Robocop ever since I have watched it the 1st time, and right now they came out with the blu ray trilogy, and of course as a blu collector, i bought it, the transfer is just like everyone talking about, the quality of the pic still can improve especially the 1st episode, and i think they should have put all the special features that DVD has back into the 1st episode of Robocop blu ray so that everyone can enjoy the features. Anyway, i bought it in a low price, still worth for me to collect it because i love the series."
1,Beware!,"Hi!,i did purchase the first movie on BR some months ago. The reviewers said the quality of the conversion was bad, i also have some ""olds"" movies like Predator, wich also have bad quality reviews, but the quality seams ok to me, certainly isnt Transformers o IronMan quality.However, the quality of Robocop is terrible, ist worst than my ""old"" DVD, or even air TV, i say: DONT BUY IT!!, so, be carefull with this one, and wait till it is released for rent. The only good thing, the BR has some new scenes on the movie..."
2,Robocop Trilogy,"The second disc, Robocop 2 was defective and would not play at all, so I am giving this set 2 stars.For MGM to release this with a known defective disc is inexcusable."
1,SAVE your money....same Robocop as previously issued....,so you can buy it for under ten bucks anywhere (and we all know it not only is a bad transfer but has NONE of the great bonus features available on the normal DVDs)..so all you get for your huge investment is a bare bones 2 and 3...I can't believe I got suckered into buying this but I couldn't imagine them doing this at that price...fool me once...well I'll wait in the future until some other person does the experimenting.
1,The ROBOBOX version is LAME.,"Amazon is confusing, they put the SAME reviews for two DIFFERENT DVD Boxsets. Make sure you DO NOT get the ROBOBOX and are looking at the Robocop MGM Trilogy. The great version of the Robocop collection is the MGM version with Robocop 1 UNCUT. The Robocop 1 in the ROBOBOX collection is EDITED! I was mislead by all the positive reviews so I ended up getting the lame Robobox which simply just has the movies, no extras, and a butchered/edited masterpiece (yep, there are a couple minutes missing from Robocop). Avoid the blue Robobox, it's not the same DVD set everyone here is praising, it's DIFFERENT, not the definitive version of these classic movies. I wish somebody made that clear before I made a big mistake."
3,"Very bare bones, picture quailty still an improvment over the DVD Trilogy","The Robocop trilogy on Blu-Ray is pretty much the same as was issued on DVD back in 2005. Other reviewers have complained that Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 have not been digitally remastered in any way. They are correct but forget to mention that even without the picture being remastered the Blu-Ray's still have a picture improvement over the DVD's. Also, the soundtrack to every movie is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. If you have a sound system 5.1 channel or better and a device that supports the Master Audio the upgrade is warranted. While I do feel that its a shame that Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 were not remastered I do recommend the set especially to those who have sound systems. I recommend buying this at any price point under $25 and not higher."
4,"I'd buy that for a dollar, but.....",".... Where are all the Special Features from the Robo 07 DVD release? Other then that I couldnt be happier to have this in my Blu collection, and for the Deal of the Day price of $17.98, it dont get any better then that. Especially when BB is expecting folks to kick down $45.99 for it, what a sham!"
5,Robocop Trilogy blu ray,"Muy buena calidad de película, además de ser un excelente título. This blu ray is exelent and the movie is exelent to."
3,Shipping,"For some unknown reason, Amazon refused to ship this item to a perfectly good UK address. So it seems that the Brits are not allowed to watch crazy American fictional robots - Maybe we are prone to turn into automatic cop killers because we watched Robocop."
2,"Poor presentation for the ""Robocop"" films is truly inexcusable--image quality mediocre at best and no special features","The Blu-ray release of the ""Robocop Trilogy"" on Blu-ray is disappointing; while the films look marginally better with slightly improved sharpness, the older HD master is riddled with edge enhancement artifacts and suffers softness. The second and third films look a bit better than the original film but, again, it's a marginal improvement over all.Audio is decent sounding although dialogue can get lost with the first film and that could easily have been remedied during the transfer stage.There are no special features which is inexcusable given that there were special features that could have been licensed from Criterion's edition for the first film or even ported over from the DVD boxed set.Over all the presentation of all three films is careless and sloppy.I'd wait to see if this is reissued again unless you can get it for very little money."
4,Anamorphic sequels....finally!,"What I find disturbing on Amazon.com and most other DVD sites is the lack of information about a release's format. All three ROBOCOP films are finally in Anamorphic Widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1. This is the first time Robo 2 and 3 get anamorphic releases, so for me, this alone was worth the cost, since I already owned the definitive Criterion Robocop. This is a slightly better release, however, in that it has some featurettes and trailers. It's great to finally watch Robo 2 (and the slightly sillier Robo 3) in Anamorphic Widescreen on my 65"" HDTV, and in DD 5.1! While Robo 1 is still the best of the three, by far, don't discount Robo 2 and 3 for they have their moments too."
2,Great movies - zero Remastering,"I swear that some guy in his basement with a DVD copy of Robocop ran DVDDecrypter, a blu-Ray burner, and burned it. Buy the DVD set. If you want to see something on blu-Ray in the Sci-Fi genre, forget MGM and get a good Universal Pictures movie or series. The original Star Trek series remastered on Blu-Ray jumps out of the screen in vibrant colors and hyper-realism."
1,Dont Buy!!!,I sadly enough bought this set because I am a fan of the movies. However when i received it i found that sadly the video quality is exactly the same as the dvd's and there are no special features at all. buy the dvd's not the bluray since its not worth the high price.
5,Prime Directives,"This is the Robocop Trilogy including all three action packed instalments. Of course the original Robocop is the only one that really makes it a point to comment on society the other 2 are still entertaining. Although this boxed set only includes special features for Robocop 1 and only trailers for 2 and 3 it's the only way to get the ""Extended Cut"" of Robocop, which contains 1 minute of extra gore I beleive. So, the price is right, and this is worth the purchase for any scifi/action fan."
1,Don`t waste your money,"this boxset is absolutly unnecesary.the movies audio and video are ok, but they don't have any extras, just the trailers and that`s it.I don`t understand why the studio edit such a piece of crap. The dvd edition is so MUCH better.Shame on you MGM."
2,Juss cant get into it...,"Young jeezy's ""The inspiration"" has no inspiration... Like his album before this one ? ""thug mov"" & ""trap or die"" or wuteva tha f*ck he called it? It falls flat and he just wants to be big and make alot of money, and be on mtv or b.e.t. All day long, just like 50/g unit along wid other wack rappers. Two starts simply cause the song ""dreamin"" is actullie good but the rest of the album is garbage."
3,Slick ideas,I wish I had found this book about 15 years ago. Now I'm 66 and it may be too much to try. The prices for parts are completely out of the stratosphere now compared to 15 years ago. A lot fewer running junks on the road. Maybe I'm crazy but I'm going to try it anyhow. If I croak before I'm done maybe someone else can have some fun. LOL
5,"Excellent instrumental, combines rock and jazz","I really love this album. It is a diamond in the rough. Kofi Baker's drum solo and Jonas Hellborg's bass guitar solo are especially amazing.Kofi Baker (son of legendary drummer Ginger Baker) is undoubtedly one of the best drummers in the world.This music is sort of a cross between jazz and rock. I am not much of a jazz fan, mostly enjoying classic rock such as Led Zeppelin, the Moody Blues, the Who, Pink Floyd. If you like those groups you will love this album."
2,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"RECIEVED THE RACK IN SEVERAL DAYS, BOX IN TERRIBLE CONDITION FROM AGE, ALL THE PARTS INSIDE THE BOX WERE NOT WRAPPED FOR PROTECTION, SCRATCHS ON SEVERAL PARTS, SEVERAL SCREWS AND SCREW COVERS WERE MISSING, CALLED FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE TWICE. NEVER RECIEVED A RETURN PHONE CALL TO RESOLVE THIS.HAD TO BUY PARTS AT THE HARDWARE STORE TO COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION"
2,Get something sturdier!,"The bottle is made of a safe plastic, but it feels really cheap. The nozzle is also pretty stiff, so you have to really tug at it sometimes. The cage is pretty thin steel, so it bends at the slightest touch. I didn't have many problems with the bottle falling out, but the plastic tab that holds the bottle down starts wiggling around right after you start using it. It lasted about a year (I didn't use my bike that frequently) before the thin wire cage snapped off of it's base. It's probably worth investing is something a little more expensive and a lot more sturdy."
4,Works,This product really works as it should. This is a good value product and I would but again when required.
4,Good product but doesn't stay on,"This is very well made and I suppose would work well if it stayed up. If you have large thighs, it will not. It rolls down. I would like to add that it is pretty true to size, if anything maybe a little on the larger side and not smaller. I wish it would have worked for me, because it is well made for the money. It's just going to sit here and not be used:( Shipping was quick too! This is not the companys fault, if your a larger person, these things happen."
4,Great product,"Only problem I have is over use. I've been having some knee pain after twisting my knee. Have used this for plane rides, long meetings where sitting too long. This helps you from putting your leg / knee into a position that will hurt. Really helped improve. When I wear it too long - 6+ hours, the straps sometimes slide down into my knee. Just need to keep tightening, or wear it a little shorter length. Would definitely buy again."
3,Disappointingly out of date.,"Although the information given was essentially correct, it was not up to date regarding use of digital cameras.This book should have been thoroughly updated before being reprinted.Regards,Gregg Puckett"
1,"Outdated, bad advice, useless","The author recommend using halogen work lamps that produce extremely uneven lighting with a stripe of strong horizontal light right in the middle of the works photographed. Even if using 4 of these lamps, there is no way to get even lighting on the works.Also the digital photography discussed is totally outdated and useless.The Quick & Easy Guide to Photographing Your Artwork"
2,Not useful if you're using a digital camera,"This review was written by Cigdem Gokce. This book was written with good intentions, as can be understood from the simple and clear illustrations used to explain many aspects of photographing art work and the various examples of faulty photography. However, for digital camera users it is virtually useless for anything beyond setting up the correct lighting conditions since digital photography ise mentioned almost as an afterthought, with the bulk of the book dedicated to extensive elaboration of the merits and uses of photography film. As such, it can only be of help to those artists who still prefer to use (and manage to find) analog photography machines and films. I read this book on North Light e book archives and was glad that I didn't buy it. It's a shame that no effort was made to bring it up-to-date before publishing in 2003."
4,Excellent and important if difficult,"This is a really great book if you are interested in detailed information about the subject., but not many people will be!"
1,"Very Disappointed-Review for Grady's, not the lantern","I placed an order with this company for Black lanterns on 10/26/2011 expecting to receive in 3-5 business days - in time for a party next week. They contacted me on 10/28/11 (2 days after my order) to say they could only send me green lanterns - I need black as ordered! I explain I need black and I need them on-time. They tell me they're sorry for the inconvenience and that if I don't want green then they will cancel my order. GREAT, now I don't have time to order new ones and guarantee them on time with another company - thanks a lot Grady's Online!!!!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Cheap product = Cheap Price!You cannot replace the wick, once the one that is in there has been removed, the mechanism will not take another one no matter how you try to load it.If you are looking for a short-term use then this would be a fine product. 2 stars because its pretty much disposable.I used Citronella Oil in them and it burns fine."
3,Not as heavy material as expected.,Nice shirt however I expected a bit better quality and that the material would be heavier. Seller was fast and realible.
3,But the smell?,"It isn't for an allergy rash or hives and doesn't claim to be. But we tried it anyway for our pup's sake. It didn't do much and we didn't expect it to but as stated we thought we'd give it test run. But the sweet smell is what is to be remembered on this product, it just lingers in the room and on the pet a rather long time. I'm curious if it does work on 'hot spots'?"
2,Smell was overpowering,It caused one of my cats to vomit and one of them smelled so bad afterwards I could hardly be in the same room. I didn't see any change in their skin after use and it might work on some cats but I couldn't tolerate the odor and I am sure that the cats felt the same way.
2,Ineffective,"I used Frontline and my dog still had fleas, so I bought this thinking it would take care of what the other product didn't kill. Unfortunately that was not the case. I sprayed it directly on a flea on the bed even and it didn't even react. The smell isn't bad, and the price isn't bad, so I'm glad there's that at least, but otherwise a total waste of money."
5,"This stuff works! And it smells good, too.","Our dog's belly was bald because of his excessive licking to calm the itching caused by an allergy to the grass he loves to lie on. After just a few days of regular sparying with the Hot Spot Itch Relief Spray, the hair started to grow again. I think he's made the connection, because he doesn't run away when he sees the bottle in my hand....just stands still so I can spray."
4,Good product - Poor Sprayer,"This product does what it says it will, relieve itching on Hot Spots. Only 4 stars because of the sprayer. Do your self a favor and go to a dollar store or Walmart and get a travel size spray bottle with a squeeze sprayer because their sprayer is terrible. First bottle I bought sprayer quit working second time I used it and the second bottle you had to push several times to get a little to spray."
1,Not what I expected for Hot Spot relief......,"I've been looking for an itch relief shampoo for my golden retriever, which I'm sure she's not the only breed that tend to get hot spots during the winter, but also the summer months. This product just did the opposite for her and now I'm back with my old shampoo ""dermaplex"". Guess it's going to take a few more shampooings in the next couple of weeks to get the sores healed from biting so much. Sometimes it doesn't pay to change shampoos...had dogs for over 30yrs and most where golden's. I don't recommend this product for dog's with sensitive skin..."
2,not fully white... only reason i bought em too. im returning them.,"these cables have some kind of shielding over them that cannot be removed, and it is not full white, it has black stitching or something along the side. i got this cable because i thought it was all white, and i wanted it to be inconspicuous against my white wall. well, this breaks the deal for me. theyre going back. they shouldve included a picture of the whole thing and not just the connectors."
2,case study,"This book is a case study book, meaning it is a book of personal stories. There is no advice given in the book at all beacause it is a case study. 8 of the 13 stories are wriiten from a betrayed wife whose husband had a child with another women. Hopefully this book will allow a book to get written that will contain advice from professional child councelors, pychologists and other professionals who deal with these children and the children of the marriage. This book is basically like reading many of the free mesaage boards that you can find on the internet."
2,case study book,"This book is a case study book, in other words it is a collection of people's stories. 8 of the 13 stories are written from a betrayed wife whose husband had a child with another women. The book is good for what it is, a case study, but do not expect ANY advice because there is NONE. Hopefully this book will get attention and a book with advice from professional child councelors, psychologists, ect can get written. This book was very much like reading a message board found on the internet, personal feelings no professional advice."
5,Amazing Story,"Beyond Peleliu's characters are rich, they are vibrant, they are rounded and they are terribly flawed. In other words, they are real. The story centers on a father and a son who both measure themselves by their professional success and who both ""succeed"" in neglecting and hurting those who they love, and who they need, the most. We watch these characters' lives come full circle as the helpless little boy and the all-powerful father reverse roles in a climax that is both stunning and heart-wrenching. As I read the book, I was exhilerated by the characters' successes, crushed by their tragedies, angered by their self-inflicted mistakes and always hopeful for their resurections. But, above all else, I cared about them and I needed--really needed--to know what was going to happen to them. The story, and the characters, were ever-present in my thoughts long after I read the last page. This is a great book."
3,should have been better,The book does an okay job of updating to 3rd edition. However it fails to add much information to the campaign. And why are there no prestige classes? This is not worth buying if you already have one of the earlier Ravenloft editions. Its far from a 5 star rating but is decent for people new to Ravenloft.
2,a disappointed ravenloft fan.,"I'm crazy about ravenloft, but this item isn't so greatfor what I payed for it. If you liked Domains of Dread youprobably won't be crazy for this either. It just seems toexplain how you can get a gothic feel to your adventure everytime you play. It gives the history of the land and the population of every domain, but almost nothing about the darklords. Most of them aren't even named. While domains of dread gave each darklord a story and history, nothing is said ofthem in this text. The only thing I really liked about this text is that it hails the return of the lich king Azlain. We also find out who the new darklord of Sithicus is. If you are a ravenloft fan I'm sorry to say you will probably be dissapointed as well after waiting so long for this books release."
2,This was REALLY disappointing,"I really expected more from White Wolf and the D&D line in general. For starters, the only ""impressive"" artwork I saw was on the cover and most of the other ""art"" sucked! The description of some of the lands were lacking in ANY kind of depth. Lord Soth is gone (which really bummed me out), the Character classes in Ravenloft details were non exsistent for some of the classes, the main villains and such (and I mean all of them) are suposed to com out in another book(?!?!). For the MSRP to be [what it is] there needs to be TONS more information. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars was because of the rules on the descent into darkness which in all honesty were pretty cool. Personally I think if you want to run Ravenloft you should find the old boxed set and convert it to 3e."
1,This thing will bleed you to death,"The functionality of the fax machine is fine. It may be adequate for the very occasional user. However, I only get 150 to 200 page yield in the ink save mode. The replacement cartridges are outrageously expensive and you are forced to use OEMs. I've had this unit less than a year and have spent much more on carts than I did on the machine. This machine is headed for the garage sale. If someone offered you one for free, just say no."
1,The most expensive way to receive faxes I know of.,"Pros:Reasonably fastQuietNo jamsCons:Goes through ink at an astonishing rate and the tiny cartridges are $41.79 at the local office super store!I bought this fax for my home office. It receives relatively light use, so you can imagine my shock when my wife informed me we had just used up our 3rd $40+ cartridge! That's over $120!! Great machine... Wish I could afford it."
2,Disappointed,"This machine worked great for a few months, but its ink dried out after I haven't used it for a couple of months, and I've only received/printed less than 50 pages total so far.I bought this equipment for only $80 from Costco, and I thought that I had a great deal at that time, but now it looks like I will be spending a lot more money on the ink cartridges than my laser printer!"
2,costly ink and low yield,"I bought this machine in july 2003 for home use. After 4 months and about 50 pages of printed fax, the ink is gone.I contact Sharp regarding this problem but was told that the warranty is only for 15 days.Based on my experience, it is an expensive machine to keep because it is costing me 70 to 80 cents per fax page."
1,Significant drawbacks,"This is an adequate fax. The paper feed has jammed twice for no apparent reason. Commands are a little awkward to execute and are not always intuitive. Footprint is compact, and the resend function works reasonably well. The major drawback is that it eats ink cartridges and the replacements are expensive. I receive a small volume of faxes, not more than ten pages a month, and usually less than that, but the cartridge runs dry after a few months. Per page costs are high. This is the third fax that I have owned, and the least economical. I would recommend buying another brand, based on on my experience.Also, while you may refill cartridges, I have had poor luck with that solution."
1,Don't even think about it!,"If you make the same mistake I did and buy this machine, be prepared to change the ink constantly! It prints on average 112 pages a week and needs new ink every 7 days at $35.00 a pop. Needless to say, after owning it for one month it is going on the garbage heap."
1,Find Another Fax Machine,I bought this machine less than a year ago and am now having to replace it. It has started a Printer Error loop and can't clear the error without replacing the circuit board. Inexcusable for basic office machine puchased within the last year.
1,Save your money,"This is the worst fax machine I have ever owned. I don't know what happens to the ink, but the ink cartridge doesn't last very long. Furthermore, the print quality is horrible when it does work. You will save money and headaches in the long buying any other fax machine."
2,Buy at Your Own risk!,"It's stated that this is Sharp's ""new"" fax machine. Don't believe it - we've had this machine for years and it's a serious under-performer.You have to stand by the machine to make sure your fax actually goes through. Half the time, the machine stops during the process and you have to resend the fax. The other half of the time with incoming faxes, it bleeps, and you get a ""line error"" message, and no fax.Unreliable at best. There's better machines out there and we've just ordered Canon's L90 fax/phone."
3,Ink Cartridge Fix,"I have the UX-A1000 (basically the same fax, but in ugly greys) and that uses the same ink cartridge as the UX-B700. I found this when looking for replacement cartridges: ""I had the dry ink problem also after not using for a week. I was ready to order a new cartridge but first I tried soaking the printhead in distilled water about 10 minutes. Do not soak the cartridge just the printhead. Place in about 1/8 inches of water. Now my cartridge works fine."" -From http://www.amazon.com/Sharp-UX-C70B-Black-Cartridge-UX-B700/dp/B00008NOQ1/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=office-products&qid;=1237988885&sr;=1-1I plan to try it today, after I track down the bottle of distilled water we have hiding somewhere."
4,Another slept on Ruffin album,"I had already heard half the songs on this. I was not dissapointed when I heard the other half. It's hard to distinguish between a good album and a great album, because you have to consider other artists and records of the same time period, but I think this album is better than what it gets credit for. I think ""All I Need"" is the best song. There really isn't a bad song on this album. Like ""So Soon We Change"" LP this is defintely worth the price."
3,My daughter hates them!,"These school uniform pants/slacks by Dickies are basic, with no frills. They look like any standard uniform pants should look, but my daughter says they look like her dads pants, and there's no way she's wearing them.So if you are looking for plain and straight-looking no-frills uniform pants, these are them!"
1,Dickies - Girls' Flat Front Pants for less price,Dickies - Girls' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $12 each. Why would i pay more in amazon.com?
5,Good fit. Easy closure.,The pants fit great and are good quality. My daughter loves the hook closure and NO adjustable waistband. I love the fact that the morning routine goes more smoothly now.
3,School uniform,"I wasn't completely satisfy with this product because my daughter normally wear a 12 but I get her a 14 for additional length because she is tall. However, the pants are tight at the waist and she only had it for 1 month now. She is still wearing her size 12 from last year and no problem with the fit."
3,Not bad but not as good as I thought it might be,This book is a collection of writings penned by Bruce Lee. I wasn't as jazzed on this as I thought I might be but there were still some gems to be found in this book. One problem is a good portion of this book was the same essay several times over in a revised version. There was also a lot of stuff like term papers Bruce Lee wrote when he was a philosophy major in college and some poetry he had written so its not all martial arts stuff. Overall it was interesting if your interested in Bruce Lee or martial arts but still somewhat of a disappointment.
1,Deja Vu,"Not only has most of this material been published in other books, but most of it has been published in the previous books of the John Little series! John Little has to be the biggest Bruce Lee fanatic in the world. He probably knows more about Bruce Lee than Linda Lee does. That fact that he has to raise the price, make it a bigger hard back, and still reprint material from earlier in the series proves that he is just out for a quick buck! Bruce... we've been had. I am not going to return this book and inflict it on another poor soul, I'm going to burn it! John Little is a great author and really knows his stuff. It is just sickening that he feels comfortable putting his name on this absolute xerox of a book. Sorry John, I'm not buying any more."
5,Loved the book! Only one problem...,"I for one thought this a very informative book and enjoyed every bit it had to offer. The only problem is the fact that it reiterates almost everything that was said in the last books, only in less detail. I've practically seen every bit of material the book had to offer in other books. But, nevertheless it's a Bruce lee book and that's the bottom line. It's got my full vote."
1,Buying Anything SW:G Related is a bad idea.,"You might as well just throw your money in the toilet. Only the Star Wars name/franchise has been able to keep this game afloat for as long as it has been. With the latest changes, it will not last much longer.the SW:G Japan servers have already been shut down as of a few weeks ago. SW:G U.S. servers are well on their way."
1,CU Destroyed SWG,"There has been a great disturbance in the Force, as though thousands of players cried out against the SWG ""Combat Upgrade,"" and were silenced.Star Wars Galaxies used to be an extremely fun, engaging game. However, as of the end of April 2005, the game has completely changed. Just read some of the other reviews here talking about the so-called ""Combat Upgrade."" SOE is losing a lot of customers because they ruined Star Wars Galaxies. Now, it's just a cheap EverQuest 2 clone with Star Wars skins. If you want to play fun Star Wars games, try Knights of the Old Republic and Knights of the Old Republic 2."
1,Far too many bugs and poor customer support,"If you want to get into the Star Wars world I recomend Star Wars Republic Commando instead (GREAT gameplay, no monthly fees).In SWG, I got tired of running into bugs for most of the adventures/quests I decided to take. I would not recomend to pay for it. It seems to be a lot of new online games being released to play an old and buggy one.Player chat rooms and forums need to be moderated/filtered a lot to control upset clients from expresing their justified frustration.It could have been a VERY nice and fun online game (some people say it was, before changes SOE introduced some time ago)... but instead I find it now very buggy, poorly patched, poorly supported and full of inconsistecies."
1,Broken game - Worste ever,"They made a trial and a tutorial that seems nice but the real game is 100% broken. Game is just about unplayable. The makers of the game, SOE and LA, say it will be months before it is playable. But they still charge you $15 a month to play an unplayable game.Check all the game review sites. They all say this is the worste MMORPG in the history of online games."
4,A Charming Story,"Runaway children, a crusty old uncle, and guardian bees. A gentle adventure story with a satisfying end. Elizabeth Goudge writes as wonderful tales for children as she does for adults."
5,"A Wonderful, Warm Story","This is an absolutely charming story set in England before the war. The Linnet children are sent to live with their staid grandmother after their mother dies and their father is away in the army. Grandmother is too strict to abide, so the children steal a pony cart to make their escape. And so their adventures begin, when the pony ""delivers"" them to the home of an old, grumpy man who agrees to let them spend the night.This wonderful story is the very first book I ever owned and I never forgot the feelings of magic and wonder that I experienced reading it for the first time. Even now, as a grandmother sharing the story with grandchildren, I SO want to believe that Ezra talks to bees and that all can be right with the world.I highly recommend this book to young and old alike!"
2,Disappointed and Issuing a Caution,"As others have mentioned, the first part of this book is very enjoyable. However, I was a little on edge when mention was made of a book of spells and knew the ""Linnets and Valerians"" was not for my family when the children were directed to chant spells and pull pins out of voodoo dolls to undo the bad magic cast by someone else. In telling the children that what they were doing was okay, Ezra, a servant tells them, ""But don't tell your uncle. He'd say it were superstition. I reckon the cleverest men be ignorant at times."" The main premise of the book is that some bad things have happened because someone with bad intent used magic, but we of good intent can fix it using magic and then we will get rid of the book of spells. I probably should have given this book one star, but there were a number of likable aspects of the book. I would advise any caring adult to read the book first before giving it to a child you love."
2,Inappropriate themes for a children's book,"This book begins as a delightful Victorian-style children's adventure. However, about halfway through the book, it turns to witches and witchcraft, evil spells, and an oblivious or helpless clergyman. I am glad that I proofread it before I was going to read it to my children. I will definitely be getting rid of this book."
2,Review of Crash Impact (1991),Caution! Don't be fooled into purchasing this DVD based on the image shown on the case's front cover. The DVD has no footage of Formula One racing. Very deceptive packaging.
3,The first chapter is great however...,The first chapter describes a very different story from the one that follows. This is more of a science-fiction (man vs. machine) than a sailing epic. I was dissapointed in the lack of involvement from the Pararescueman that was introduced in the first chapter. This book kept me interested in an I-know-what-happens-next-way but I kept reading because I wanted the story line to evlove...it never did.
5,Exceptional biography offers an extremely honest insight .,"Explicit account from the man himself Tony Curtis of his vastly changing life style from his early days on the poor streets of the Bronx New York, to the high life as a young Hollywood star. One of the most well known celebrities that came from the later part of the Hollywood star stable, his biography is unusual in its style as it integrates the voices of Tony's friends and family along side Tony's own narrative, painting a very explicit and vastly interesting life. It pulls no punches and tells it as it is , and is a must read for all his fans. Including information On the Persuaders starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore. ITC action adventure programme first broadcast in 1971"
3,"lots of detail, but WHAT an egomaniac!","Interesting details about TC's life.Still, his animosity toward his ex-wives (except for Janet Leigh) is a huge turn-off, as is his constant whining. The worst, though, is the amount of times he talks about what a big star he was (and still thinks he is), and how incredibly handsome he thinks he is. He actually makes the ridiculous statement that people still stop and stare when he walks in the room because of his extreme handsomeness; I think the truth is that they can't believe how AWFUL he looks now!And as for his ""art""...as if anyone would pay $$$ for that crap if it wasn't done by Tony Curtis. I know this is an old cliche, but my four-year-old son could paint just as good."
3,Classic,"I grew up watching all the great actors of the 40's, 50's and 60's. It good to read about their lives and get some insight into who they were. He was good looking (and he knew it). He was made for comdey. I enjoyed ""Some LIke It Hot""; one of my favorites."
4,Good for veggies aswell as meat eaters!,You can use this book year round - lots of ideas for indoor and outdoor cooking - book has lots of variety with stuff for both meat eaters and veggies. The ABC of cooking by AWT is also worth a look as it has good advice for every day cooking...
4,"Like a Good Drag Queen, Entertaining and Flamboyant","This book will be great for settling a bet at a party.The amount of information is wonderful and while reading it I had plenty of ""wow that's how that happened"" or ""so that was a myth"" moments. Certainly, this will help all the readers when it comes to pub trivia.However, some thing are overtly ""sexualized"" like the section that pretty much says boots exist simply as phallic symbols. In addition, the chapter on castrati was fascinating but dragged on too long. However, the biggest complaint I have is the lack of citation. The author includes a long list of suggested reading, but I would like to be able to verify the facts.Overall though this book is fun and is good way to pass the time. It is light enough for some fun beach reading, but you can learn a few things as well."
5,Lay That Trumpet In Our Hands,This story may have been written for young people but as a senior citizen I found it to be an interesting and compelling story of what wasn't so good in the good old days when segregation was still causing heartache especially in Florida.The author actually lived in the area she wrote about and did a lot of research of the Civil Rights era.This book had many heartwarming parts and also brought me to tears. My friends and I all read the book and then went out to lunch at the inn that was mentioned in the book. I liked the book so much that I read it twice.After I read it I gave it to my husband and he enjoyed reading it too.
5,Great read!,"A wonderful story in true ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" tradition.Well written; easy to read. Highly recommend! Our book club loved it!!"
5,My Aunt,"Hey Aunt Susan I don't know if you read these reviews but it was a really good book, for all you other people you should get this book its awesome. My Aunt wrote it."
5,The best!,I looked all over for this when my son was 3 for christmas. My friend got them for her boys and I loved playing with it. We got all the parts even the one for the fridge! Even now that my son is almost 7 he plays with it. Even my almost 100 year old grandmother plays with them! Its the best for the whole family.When I ran a daycare out of my home all the kids fought over this toy so much I thought about buying another one.
3,"Interesting, but not fun","Got this for my nephew - he was interested in it - and he and his sister liked it well enough - but there's not too much to it. Not a toy, pre-se, or a game. More like a distraction."
3,Overpriced,"The gun itself is as realistic as you're going to get without buying a real M4, it's just that you can find the same gun for $1200 other places. The gun is worth $1200, but not $1450"
1,seriously,"They expect people to shell out that much for an airsoft gun? I'm pretty sure you have better things to spend that 1.5K on instead of a whacked out, overpriced, FAKE, gun that shoots plastic pellets."
2,No one would buy this..,I got this book as a gift..heck I even read it..I dont wish this piece of fiction on my worst enemy..get real..I can say there is a face on a doughnut...ya nut ball
4,Cheech and Chong's Nice Dreams,"Classic Cheech & Chong Movie - Very funny with silly and crazy story. Entertaining movie, but would recommend PG-13 rating, not suitable for younger children under 13 years old in my opinion."
3,2 funny guys in a very strange film!,"This was a very weird film with lizard people and pot smoking cops. Bits are funny, but the weirdness definately permeates through most of the film, especially a sequence near the end where Cheech & Chong are being held in a padded cell. trippy stuff, which kept me interested, but not as funny as I had hoped. Up in Smoke still remains my favorite in the Cheech & Chong series."
2,Chicken man eats Hamburger Dude!!,"I recently bought this movie after reading the reviews on Amazon but I ended up being disappointed...despite Chicken Man's best efforts. My main grumble is the inactivity of Sgt. Stedanko. All he does in this movie is smoke pot, mumble aimlessly and then turn into a lizard!! Things are much better when he's clear-headed and on the case. There are some redeeming moments in the film, namely the mental asylum scenes (where we meet Chicken Man) and also the Chinese restaurant madness...oh (...) However, the rest of the movie just ambles along. I think the only funny moment in the first half of the movie is when we see a lizard smoking pot. In fact I think Mr Chong was suffering from a strange fascination with these reptiles and unfortunately lost all focus on making a good movie. OK man."
3,Not a classic like Up in Smoke,"Overall, this movie wasn't as good as Up in Smoke or Next Movie (my favorite C&C movie) but it's a classic compared to Still Smokin and Corsician Brothers (perhaps C&C's worst).The first half hour started off good but then it's a see-saw battle of good and boring parts. If you're a C&C fan, then I would recommend this movie for you, and if you're a beginner, start with Up in Smoke or Next Movie."
4,up in smoke is the best,i'm a huge cheech and chong fan their movies are great does anybody know if these selections can be picked up on the dvd?
2,Only for true C&C fans,"""Nice Dreams"" is nowhere near as funny as ""Up in Smoke"" or ""Next Movie"". The jokes are lame, the situations have already been done, and C&C look like they're going thru the motions. I laughed twice throughout the whole movie!"
1,Review for non-dopers,"Worse than C&C:Next Movie, the gags are getting old and there is little real comedy in this movie.... unless of course you blow your brains out with as much cannabis as you can handle. DON'T DO THIS! Find another movie."
4,More like C&C,"Nice Dreams comes in 2nd behind Up In Smoke, in my opinion. The innocent, goofy demeanor of Cheech and Chong are better portrayed in Nice Dreams than in Next Movie. One complaint I have, is they left Sgt. Stedanko out of the main plot. I think it added alot more humor to the story when he was an uptight, though incompetent, police Sargeant in hot pursuit of Cheech and Chong along with his numbskull officers. Though brain-dead things like Chong cashing a check for the Hamburger Dude with NON NEGOTIABLE stamped across the front made it worthwhile."
5,All you need to keep them moving,"This was the Christmas hit. Now all of the extended family have purchased it so we get to play at home and when we are visiting. They are playing video games and off the couch, we all win."
5,5 stars!,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my kids (ages 5 & 8). They've played it for HOURS! They love the fact that they're actually in the game (i.e. swinging at baseballs, punching punching bags, etc.) I enjoy watching them play!I would highly recommend this game. This was certainly one of their highlights for Christmas!"
4,fun for the entire family,Both my teenage son and younger daughter like this game. Fun for the entire family. Great way to get some physical exercise ... true interactive play! Only complaint is we had to bring extra lights into the room for the camera to work properly.
5,Great for kids' parties!,The game is lots of fun. We got it for my son's 10th birthday and he invited his best friends for a sleep over to celebrate. The game was a blast! They played until they got really tired and had lots of fun.The game requires very good illumination.
5,Love the game,"I got this game for my niece on her birthday and she just loves it. All the kids played it, they couldn't get enough. It was fun and too cute."
4,must have good lighting,has good variety of interesting games; I don't recommend it for 3-4 yr old; the complexity of operating the menus and understanding how to position themselves in relation to the camera is beyond their mental capacity; you'll have to stand by them to get the game going for them; sometimes the game wouldn't operate reliably but I think that is because the lighting wasn't adequate; I had to turn on all the lights in the room and bring in an extra lamp; but if you have enough lighting the camera will work
3,Perfect for children group games,"This game is a excellent complement to the first one released. I actually bought it for my 4-yr old daughter and its perfect when she has her little cousins come over. Encourages teamwork, individual effort/competitiveness, and its just heck of fun to play even for adults."
5,Fun!,We got this for our nephews but we tried it out before giving it to them. It was lots of fun. It was pretty easy to set up and use too.
2,Good for little kids,"This game is good for little kids, but would be boring for teenagers and adults. It has a number of different games on it and you stand in front of the tv, but mostly you use just your hands to play it. I was looking for one more for adults to play and this is not it. However your young children might enjoy it."
2,More frustrating than fun,"Using this is tricky. You have to have bright light (difficult to achieve in our basement) and stand the right distance from the TV. My kids found it an exercise in frustration. After a couple days of trying, they stopped using it."
5,great video game,"this video game was recommended to me by my 19 yr. old son, for my 7 yr. old son. it is a great hit, my 7 yr. old loves it and my other sons (ages 19 and 22) enjoy it also. very entertaining, well worth the money."
1,"Great Game, BUT...","At first, I was very satisfied with this game, its concept, and its execution. It is very fun and gives kids a great workout. It is targeted at little children and kids of all other ages. That being said, the game hit a very wrong chord with me. One of the many games on it involves pretending to prepare food. At one point, a chef comes to challenge you (my 4 year old son) to a cooking duel. When my son beat him, the game said ""Damn, you beat me"". I do not want to expose my children to such language and I find it annoying that a game that targets children would contain such language."
4,Family Fun,We got this for Christmas as a group present. There is definately something for everybody from 4 to any age. The games keep you moving and help the kids to really use their energy. Also helps kids be more conscious of the movements that their making to play the games. Best of all everybody has fun no matter who wins!
5,eye toy -- lots of fun,The eye toy is a lot of fun for a group to play. You can try to beat your high score or the other players. It is also fun to watch other people playing the games.
2,Good idea for boards maybe - didn't work for chalkboard painted walls,I was hoping this would be a solution for cleaning off our giant chalkboard wall. It absolutely did not work for that surface. The cloth caught on every tiny bump and tore apart.
3,Good CD,I bought this CD for one song specifically but found several other songs on here that made it a good CD. If you're a Randy Travis fan then you'll probably find this CD worth while.
5,"Awesome Album! Greatest Hits of Virginia's Aria Moda, Vocal Blues and Mood Music Genre Classics","This is a timeless album. It's actually a mixture of a couple albums, but for some reason it's not listed as a greatest hits. None-the-less, it does consist of some of Virginia's best songs! Highly recommended for fans of Natalie Imbruglia, Demi Lovato, Kelly Clarkson, Bruno Mars, Jewel and even Pink Floyd. I would also check out her albumHushin CD form orHushas MP3 downloads, her new double album, also in MP3 format,Someone Like Mevol. 1 & vol. 2 as well as her first albumSweet Conscience, which is only available right now in physical CD form.Leave a review if you've had the chance to enjoy these story-telling, crowd-pleasing favorites. Her genre is considered Mood Music, Aria Moda, or Vocal Blues, although her music isn't described as bluesy, it has a blue undertone that some may interpret as dark and ambient."
5,Wonderful read,"A nest of sparrows is one of the best books I have ever read. I just finished it for the second time and am now sending it to my cousin who is a missionary. Deb Rainey has you crying and empathizing with the characters and especially Wade who tries so hard to make a home for his fiance's children, after her sudden death. When she dies, Deb transports us to heaven as she leaves her body and that gave me chills. I could not put this book down and I already new what happened in the end. Dee is a wonderful character too, as the social worker that tries her best to keep the children with Wade. It is romantic and not overdone.Deborah Rainey is an excellent storyteller and takes her readers to some of the ""hard places"" where we would rather not go but are rewarded when we do."
3,"Helpful, But Basic","Our high school recently bought this item. It is a basic introduction to the key figures in ""The Canterbury Tales"" presented in ""stop action"" style, with the camera panning various illustrations of characters. Main characters are introduced, such the Squire, Wife of Bath, etc. After previewing, the teacher thinks it will be helpful but students (esp. high school) might be put off by the ""cartoon style."" Please be warned that this video is only 14 minutes long, which seems short for the price. Consider for purchasing - but do not expect lavish production or in depth material."
2,I wouldn't use it again,"I bought this for use in my classroom, but it was dreadfully dull. Chaucer is funny; he's bawdy; he's ironic. But as told in this drab DVD, it's almost as good as Ambien. I ended up talking about the Prologue as I usually do, which according to my students is both animated and engaging--two qualities completely alien to this film. And at $49.99 for 14 minutes?? What was I thinking???"
4,Good review of this disorder,This covers all the general topic to address this problem. It is somewhat global in discussing how to provide psychotherapy and family treatment.
1,Too little text,"This magazine is less than 100 pages long and only five (5) pages are devoted to text describing how to date photos. While there is some useful information, it is too little. The rest of the pages are just old photos that are grouped by era, with no annotations to help you determine how the photo is dated. If you really want to know how to date photos as the title suggests, try a different book."
2,old photos,"Definately not worth the money. Lots of good photos grouped by time period, but almost no information on the characteristics that date the photo."
2,"Lots of pictures, not so much help in interpreting how to apply them to dating my own photos.","I thought this book would be of help in dating my own photos, but it needs more explanation to do that. I gather I'm supposed to infer how to date my own photos from looking at examples, but I'm not too good at inferring."
3,Straight up indie/punk from custards first release,"Hard to find ep, best off getting the far cheaper brisbane 1900-1993 cd which combines gastanked and brisbane eps into one.As far as the songs go, it is a very raw early custard with pop punk riffs and fairly standard lyrics. Good ep though for an insight into ealry ustard and there are no downright awful songs to be had here."
5,Amy's meds,This product was exactly what i was looking for and got it at a great price it was shipped when they said and arived on time
1,Item didn't come as how picture shows,"I bought my beanie buddy from the website below and was expecting to receive the toy as it showed on the website:http://www.amazon.com/TY-Beanie-Buddy-HOPE-Praying/dp/B00002SWVY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1243375694&sr;=1-2but somehow the toy I received was this one:http://www.amazon.com/Ty-Beanie-Buddy-Hope-Praying/dp/B001ISD42O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1243375694&sr;=1-3It looks totally different and the fur falls when I touch it. I think the seller posted to a wrong place, so I am disappointed and doesn't know what to do with this toy now. Amazon should be careful on whether the item was posted properly and whether it fits to the description. It wasn't a good and reliable experience for me on Amazon. Toy didn't come as how it looks like on the picture."
4,These are COOL!,I love the fact that these bags are a sterile environment to pump into. I had absolutely NO issues pumping into the bags and love saving the extra step it takes to pump into a bottle and then pour into a bag to store. The bags are well made and protect the milk in the freezer too. I have friends who had issues with the bags initially but it was all user probs and not a prob with the bags. I would like it if you could feed right out of the bag though.
3,Broken,"This is my second one, the first one did not work. After chatting with tech support, it was decided I return item for a replacement.The replacement worked OK...Not quite as HIGH POWER as I was expecting, but I guess you get what you pay for."
4,GREAT...with one little complaint,"I purchased these canisters for my new kitchen and they were just the quality you would expect from Calphalon. They are durable, stylish, and easy to use because of their unique oval shape. The one thing I dislike about this set is that even the largest canister is not big enough to hold a standard 5-lb bag of flour. The middle size holds a full bag of sugar--3 lbs--but the largest is about three cups too small for a full flour bag. Otherwise, a great set!"
3,Attractive but...,"These are attractive and well built, but the suction sprays the contents all over the counter when you open them and then when you close them you have to juggle with the lids to keep the lids from popping back open. I have tried twisting the lids from various angles and varying the speed to no avail. They are hard to close and messy when opening. But they are nice looking and sturdy. A bit small, and there are only three of them however, so depending on how much capacity you need these might be inadequate. I have Tupperware cannisters that are much more practical from a functional perspective, but they are not nearly as decorative to look at, so it depends on your needs..."
4,Great Set but....,"This is a great set but I agree with a previous reviewer. The large canister does not hold a full bag of flour, at least not a 5 lb. bag of flour. However, the large one does hold a full bag of sugar (4lbs.) with some room to spare. The brushed finish is fantastic and the oval shape is even better. Now, if only calphalon would come out with a matching extra large canister, about 4 or 4.5 qts, I would truly be ""one happy camper""!"
3,mommy dearest?,"Good writing and realism helped carry this novel a while for this reader. But I felt the lack of respect and compassion I had for all the characters tended to drag this novel down, and it became a bit of a chore to finish. No one had any morals or any brains. I wish I could've felt compassion for Mildred Pierce, but she stupidly enabled her ""bad seed"" daughter Veda every other page."
3,Not a crime or detective book,"This book was easy to read but not too interesting. One did not greatly care what happened since Mildred did such dumb things at times--tho she was successful in ways were satifying since one sort of was ""for"" her despite her morals."
4,endorsing the product,product is just as oem if nit better then.Fit perfectly just needed more sticky tape or I contact tape to Farson mirror probably over all 4stars. Philjuniorp@aol com
5,Forces of creation,"Awe and perhaps a bit of terror are the appropriate responses to this work. Schulz wrote like a man possessed by the spirit of creation - his sentences are alive, they breathe and hiss with color and form as a revelation of the world is made. His control of imagery incarnate in language slides and shifts from the most gracious to the most grotesque. Beyond it all is a vision of the cogs and gears upon which the cosmos turns, a radiant pattern from the Baroque era. Schulz dropped down to the mythopoeic essence at the core of time and crafted stories that told more of his childhood than any more literal record could've.Ten stars, and sadness for the premature passing of one of the greats."
1,Flimsy and damaged,"Gave to my daughter as a Christmas present. She tells me that the box it came in was falling apart, appeared to have been wet at some time (when tried to open it, it just fell apart). Grout gone from tiles on table top, several tiles missing. Others loose. Whole thing seems flimsy and poor quality. Did not go to the trouble of putting the pieces together, am returning for refund."
5,Um . . . they're Blades,"I hope I never come across a vendor who sells hobby-knife blades that deserve a complaint.This is such a simple product to manufacture and so cheap in bulk purchases that I couldn't justify buying ""Brand name"" blades. They cut and I haven't soaked them in brine so no rust yet.Save your money - buy these."
4,Techni Edge #11 Hobby Blades,"A lot more durable and sharper than I thought they would, be especiallyfor the price.I recommend this product for any use."
1,Blech,"I realized at the end of the day.. Stick to what you know. I normally buy Xacto blades for stenciling. I go thru blades fast so I figured buying this pack of 100 would save me some money... All it honestly has done is give me aggravation. I used this brand to cut thru .003 acetate paper, it would snag and tear along the sheet, it wasn't as sharp as I wanted. U could use it for a good 5 minutes before it craps out on u... I read the reviews before I bought them and I figured u guys would steer me I the right direction. Not this time. If u have to spend a little extra for better quality, then do it. Now I have 100 dull blades on hand, and no use for em"
1,Very poor,"I purchased these blades thinking they would be similar quality to other brands. I liked that they were made in USA. But the quality was terrible. Many of them didn't even have points on the blades, and the ones that did dulled or broke almost immediately. I'm a paper cut artist, so I spend a great deal of time working with these blades. I ended up returning these and sticking to excel."
4,Great value,"I had been buying blades 5 at a time at the local arts & crafts store for about $6 a pack, but will never buy them that way again! So, these blades are cheap, but if the tip snaps off, you have 99 more!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"After the very first use--the very first--the teflon coating is already peeling off exposing the steel below it. I made pasta in the pot and used a SOFT plastic spatula to gently stir it. After that there were already two spots where the coating had come completely off. Now I have used it about 5 times total and the coating looks like it has been scraped with a metal spatula hundreds of times. And no, I did not put it in the dishwasher. Not even once. I used a very soft plastic spatula and did not stir hard. I've had far better quality from an $7.99 pot purchased at a discount store. I seriously don't understand how the quality could be so poor and this company is still in business. Avoid this unless you want to eat teflon flakes with your pasta."
2,Mirro Get-A-Grip 3-Quart Nonstick Aluminum Saucepan with Lid,The pan is OK. The bottom of the pan is not heavy like other pans that I bought. My food was burned faster than I expected.
1,poor quality,"I bought this thinking it would last at least for a while. The coating is already coming off on the bottom. I have only hand washed and used only plastic utensils. I have used this pan possibly a dozen or so times, but not much more than that. Surely a product shouldn't be that disposable should it? Now I'm looking for a good replacement, and this is going to the trash."
1,Okay camera...when it works!!,"My teenage daughter bought this camera with money she had saved. It worked well for a few months and then quit. Every time you turn it on, it will stay on for a few seconds and then beep that the batteries are dead then turn itself off. This happens every time, even when the batteries are fresh out of the package. This camera was a waste of money."
2,Good while it lasted!,"I own two of these little cameras. The first was purchased for work and I liked it so much that I purchased another one for the family. The second one I purchased (Christmas 06) has already bit the dust! Not long after that, the 1st one started having issues. I sent the 2nd one in for repair over a month ago and haven't heard a word! Not sure if it's worth sending the 1st one in or not....not mention that the support on their website is a joke and time waster!! If you buy this camera...hope you have better luck than I did! I've had a canon slr for over five years and it's never had any issues or malfunctions!!!"
2,batteries do not last,"my husband bought me this camera about 3 yrs. ago and its time for a new one. This camera is good when you can get the batteries to work! first i used rechargables, didnt last, and now no batteries will work. doesnt last long.."
1,Not worth it,"I got this camera as a gift. The users guide was unclear and required lots of steps to do even the littlest thing.The pictures were blurred and fuzzy and then everytime I tried to take a picture the screen would say ""No Pictures"" It was crazy. So I called Samsung and this representive made me do like tons of things to it and none of it worked. He labeled it as defecteve. So I took it back to Target with the gift recipt and asked if a lot of these cameras were coming in as defective. He said yes, so then he showed me the awsome hp Photosmart M425 which was the same price and i exchanged it. The hp is great for me with no bulging battery compartment on the front unlike the samsun. The hp was easy to use with only 9 buttons and a takes crystle clear images. Dont waste your money on a horrible camera."
1,Inferior Product,"This camera is not worth anything. Every picture that I have taken with it so far has been terrible. The photos blur easily. Even with the settings tweaked to have sharp clear images, they still turn out badly. I don't think that the features like sepia tone, red, green, blue, and the other features make up for the fact that this product is inferior."
4,Good camera for the money.,"So far I am impressed. We bought this for our 10 year old grandson. he takes great pictures with it.Pros: very easy to use,nice features. Most cameras this price range dont have optical zoom.Cons: shutter speed a little slow and flash a little slow on recovery, but no worse than any other camera I have seen yet in this price range."
3,Good when it works,"Bought this item from [...] Very happy to see it, its finish looked good. FUnctionality looks just fine.However it wouldnt take my sd card. i tried other SD cards , didnt work. Says Card LOCKED. i tried same cards in other cameras, worked fine. tried same card in same model camera in target, worked fine. so defective piece.Returning it, but will buy the same one again. probably from amazon"
3,Not bad for a cheap camera,"This is my first digital camera. All in all I would have to say it doesn't take that bad of pictures for a point and click. It has a few effects that are fun to play with but I haven't had the opportunity to play with them all. The camera does have two down sides that I've noticed so far... it eats up batteries quickly and the closeup feature does not work well enough. For photos on the go it's fine.. stock up on batteries. For me it serves my purpose for the time being, but don't even try to get artsy."
1,Unusable because of battery consumption,"I made the mistake of buying two of these. One for my wife and one for my son at the same time. Sure, they are cheap, but they should at least work like a camera. They take double A batteries. You are literally lucky to get 10 pictures out of a set of new batteries. Sometimes you get 3 or 4. You literally have to carry a pocketful of batteries to use this camera. Sure, the pictures are great, you just can't take any. There is nothing more frustrating. I have an old Cannon Elph that will take literally hundreds of pictures on one charge. These guys are begging for a class action lawsuit."
4,Awesome! Absolutely awesome,"I HAVE JUST FINISHED READING THIS BOOK AND I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND IT TO ANY BOOK LOVER WHO LIKES STRONG HEROES, A GREAT PLOT AND AN ENDING TO DIE FOR.tHIS IS A GREAT ONE GUYS GO FOR IT AND IF U DONT LIKE IT, CLAIM THE MONEY FROM ME! ;O)YEAH THAT GOOD!"
2,An ordinary book with an extraordinary premise,"Vampire$ was a book with a great premise, killing vampires for money, however it never lived up to the expectations that I had for it. To say that it was hard to tell who was thinking what in the begining, before Felix took over the book, would be an understatement. I found myself rereading paragraphs over and over again just so I would know who was thinking what. This ended however when Felix joined the team. Once that happened it turned from the Jack Crow story to the Felix story. Crow was by far the more interesting character, he had human flaws and weaknesses, while Felix was perfect in every respect. Here's to hoping that John Carpenter does a better job with the story when the movie, scripted and directed by Carpenter, hits the big screen."
1,"Great, if you like purple prose.","I had high hopes for this book because I'm a great fan of vampire literature and like James Woods and all that but when I first started reading this book I couldn't figure out what was bothering me, distressing me and then I figured out it was Steakley's writing style which goes on and on like this forever and forever with no letup, beating us, blinding us, giving no quarter, making me wish for just one period, even one, and then when he finally comes to the end of a sentence he ends it.In the next paragraph. And when he's not doing that, he begins paragraph after paragraph with the same word:And this got really irritating.And it was because the story was weak.And the characters even weaker.And maybe by the end I just didn't care."
1,OK but just not what I like,Vampire$: A NovelWell written but the storyline just didn't quite grab me. Just not my kinda vampire book I guess
5,Incredibly Fun,"Now, I gave this book 5 stars and by that I do not mean it to be a total classic like the Illiad, but this book was an immense amount of fun. I truly have never had as much fun reading a book as i did this one. There are better books, but there are very few that are this much fun. The movie was a complete travesty in terms of trying to relate the book. DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE. Do read the book."
2,Yawn.,"So I finally spot this novel I've read so much about on the net....what a letdown. I was expecting so much more, you know, like maybe some insight into the vampire myth, some great characters, geez, even a good story for cripes sake. What I got were cardboard characters, weak plot and run-on sentences like you wouldn't believe. Save your money & time and read Interview With a Vampire instead. This same review score can also apply to Steakley's Armour as well. Sorry folks, overrated in my book, anyway."
4,Couldn't put it down.....,"I've read several vampire books (Anne Rice, Stephen King, etc.) and found this one to be it's own unique story. After reading other user reviews about how the book is much better than the movie, I'll avoid the movie, but I'm definitely going to look up some other Steakley books to give them a try. Steakley writes with a raw language that cuts to the chase, and I found it refreshing in how the characters interacted with each other with such honesty and (for the most part) open emotion."
1,a shame,"Terrible.'Armor' was a good book. This is cr@p. Throwing us into the middle of a vampire vs humans fight is fine, but it was all so self conscious and over the top. I suppose those who like the vampire movie by Tarantino would like this. I gave him about 60 pages. That's over an hour of my life I'll never get back... The dialogue is cheezy, the characters have no depth. It's like someone took a comic book and removed the pictures. Yuck."
3,Rare Instance of Movie Being Better than the Book,"John Steakley's ""Vampires"" is a fun horror/action tale which follows the adventures of a team of Vatican financed vampire killers. The tale does a wonderful job of creating a dark world where the forces of good and evil are in state of constant war. While the book is generally entertaining it pales in comparison to John Carpenter's 1998 film adaptation. The film takes the book, which is good but lethargic at times, and gives it a more kinetic spin. It was a liberal adaptation to be sure, and Carpenter changed much, but it generally worked. I wouldn't recommend this book to those who have already seen the film, but for those looking for a fun novel equal parts action and horror, you may enjoy Steakley's work."
1,"Interesting ideas, but...","I picked up this book because I saw and liked the movie. The concept of a crew of workaday vampire killers and their specialized equipment intrigued me. I hoped there would be more of that in the book than there was in the movie, but I was disappointed.And what a tough read! Macho men and women as envisioned by a Sci Fi conventioneer. The painful chapter about the tragic heroine lifted from bad gothic romances was almost unreadable and killed whatever momentum the book had. More shallow than most comic books.Stick with the movie even though it falls apart towards the end. James Woods is terrific."
2,Bad book. Better movie.,"I just finished reading the Vampire$. I felt terribly cheated that John Carpenter's movie out shines the novel on which it was based. The novel is overly 'campy'. The writing is fast and poor, and leaves you to wonder how some of the characters get from one end of a room to the other. It is as if John Steakly just sat down and wrote this book in a day. Read it if you must, there are plenty of better vampire books out there."
4,good book,"a pretty good book,not as good as armor though, even though the two main characters, Felix and Jack Crow (if he sets it in a different time period shouldn't he at least give them a different name. Vampire$ has several other references to armor (the antwar saloon being the most obvious) which I'm not sure is annoying or not"
3,Needs new plot.,"Maybe its me, but when I read ""Armor"" I was very impressed, but I think Mr. Steakley needs to find some new caracters and names for his Heroes. Vampires$ was slow, spent to much time telling us how the vampire killers blew off steam and if ""Felix"" got anymore depressing it would have done us all a favor if the Vampire would have killed him. WHY would Vampires be in Texas, for the steers. Please. Write more like ""Armor"" but stay away from vampires. oh yah the movie SUCKED and I love John Carpenter."
2,Sometimes a film is better than the book.,"This is definitely one of those cases. First of all I am a huge vampire fan. I don't go so far as to dress as one, but I am a big fan nevertheless. I've watched the John Carpenter film before I read the book. The stories are not related at all, a big plus for the book. I loved the story of the novel and it's unique approach to vampire slaying which thankfully, made it to the film. Now for the bad. The writing felt like it was written by a child. Not even in a simplistic innocent way, but by some fifth grader doing his best horror-noir impression. The character development really suffers from this, as well as the dialogue. I found myself confused with a lot of the scenes, having to flip back a few pages just to clarify what had just transpired.Overall, I'd say stay far away. Try I Am Legend by Richard Matheson, which even though written in 1954, still delivers the goods for a vampire novel."
4,"A new ""Eternal Champion"" theme?","As far as I know, John Steakley has only written two books to date: the far future military sf book _Armor_ in 1984 (in the tradition of Heinlein's _Starship Troopers_ and Haldeman's _Forever War_), and this book in 1990, superficially an entirely different work of fantasy/horror on a modern day troop of vampire hunters. Having just read this book immediately after reading _Armor_, however, it is clear to me that both books are meant to be variations on an ""Eternal Champion"" theme. Not only do the names of its two main characters repeat (John Crow and ""Felix""), but there are other clear indictions throughout the text of this intent. Both books, by the way, are excellent. Now, if Steakley would just write more in this pantheon -- or anything else, for that matter! Note, that DAW Books plans to bring _Armor_ back into print in March 1997, after it being unavailable for far too long"
4,"Interesting, but a bit overblown, perhaps.....","I enjoyed this book immensely. It doesn't give in to the 'Anne Rice' version of the vampire; none of this 'noble vampire' absurdity. The vampires in Vampire$ are not noble, misunderstood fellows, they're monsters, dark and evil and without the slightest mercy or humanity in their hearts. The vampire hunters are believable, too- i particularly enjoyed the Jack Crow, Cherry Cat and Felix characters, even though they were a wee bit too macho and overblown. The book accurately depicts the horrible fears and stresses placed on the vampires, but as a trade-off, it's a little depressing. Also, drinking, cussing, and violence abounds- proceed at your own risk. There are several flaws and poorly done sections to this book, but overall, this is an interesting and thoughful adventure. I enjoyed the quality of the writing and plot, as well. Highly recommended. Also, read Steakley's earlier book, Armor,which in many ways is even better."
4,Not Another Armor,"Like most people who eventually try to find this book I think, I had read Armor first and was hoping that Vampires would somehow trump that fantastic experience. It doesn't. The book is still interesting to read (I had trouble putting it down), but I don't believe the characters are nearly as interesting as those in Armor. I don't believe the characters are nearly as well fleshed out, they feel like sketches that the author tried to build a plot line around, but can't quite support the weight. This book would benefit from another hundred pages.It can be rude in parts, but I don't think it's that big of a deal. It does have the same John Steakley feel: ""I won't give you the exact details of the context, so you'll have to pick it up from context clues.""I enjoyed it."
4,Global Beat Enlightenment,"I loved it! I bought 4 and gave them out to friends for MY birthday! One can literally hear the music in Beres' words as he lyrically weaves a seamless mix of myth, music and ritual...Hit Play...Read on...The Global Beat journey has just begun..."
5,"Enlightening, educational, entertaining!","If you like yoga and you like music, you'll love this book! It's anabsolute must!"
5,Great Idea!,"Interdisciplinary treatment of lower back pain by a psychiatrist and neurosugeon is a great idea. This tape addresses the anatomy of the lower back, how to stretch appropriately, and back strengthening. The DVD format makes it easy to follow. I recommend it."
2,Not what I expected or wanted,"A better title would have been, ""Creating Textures in Pen & Ink, Enhanced with Watercolor."" 75% of each texture comes down to ""make a detailed ink drawing"". The other 25% is enhancing that ink drawing with watercolor. The pen & ink predominates everywhere. If this is the style of drawing you desire (e.g., detailed drawings where pen&ink predominates), then you will probably give this book 4 to 5 stars. I was looking for watercolor texture techniques and was disapointed.With that said, the drawings are very well executed and the instruction quality moderate. The author relies too heavily on step-by-step examples as a teaching tool. The addition of color greatly enhances the pen & ink drawings, with spectacular results."
3,Creating Textures in Pen & Ink with Watercolor,"Painting with Watercolor, Pen & InkWARNING!!!! I purchased both the referenced books by Cladia Nice thinking that the two books would be different. The title being reviewed ""Creating Textures ...."" is actually the first half of the second title ""Painting with Watercolor ..."" The book descriptions give no hint of the two being the same. The author should remove the smaller book for sale and/or be very clear that by purchasing the title ""Painting with Watercolor ..."" the customer would receive the same materials and save about $20.00. The author and publisher are both deceptive in effort to have more sales. The material presented is good, but not worth buying twice."
5,Crating Textures in Pen & Ink With Watercolor,Claudia Nice provides detailed instructions and examples throughout the book so that the reader can grow in their artistic skills as well as enjoy the beautiful work of the author/artist.
4,Great ideas for creating various textures,This would be a good book to keep for reference on how to achieve certain effects and texture using watercolor and ink. I wish it had a few larger scale projects but overall I think it is a book worth buying.
5,Creating Textures in Pen & Ink with Watercolors,"This book arrived in good time, excellent condition and I love it. A wonderful book that gives good information that is easy to follow. I will use it a lot. Thank you so much."
3,good if you did not buy her other book,"i did like this book, or the other one form the same author ""Painting with Watercolor, Pen & Ink"", each taken separately. However I feel a little cheated as I bought both books, and it turns out 8 out of the 11 chapters that this book contains are the same. what i mean by the same: word per word. so in a sense I paid almost $23 for three chapters..."
4,Beautifully done if you want to learn this style,"I had a friend recommend this author's work to me. Of course, tahdah, Amazon to the rescue. It's great & you won't be dissapointed!"
4,Great Book!,"I really enjoy this book! I purchased it to get fresh ideas on how to use pen & ink with watercolor types of art. First, I will say, the pens and ink suggested by this author are very expensive. Be ready to spend some money on some expensive pens!! This book describes how to use pen and ink to create textures in your watercolor paintings. It is not really what I would consider a beginners book unless you are experienced with both mediums. She does not teach you how to draw in this book. I have used watercolors, but I am new to pen and ink. Overall, this is a good book for ideas an how to use color washes with pen and ink."
3,An interesting but unspectacular house mix,"Producer and dj Junior Vasquez has been around seemingly forever, and has a fanatically loyal following of fans in the New York area. Based on what I've heard of his work, however, the ""Junior"" phenomenon must be one of those ""you hadda be there"" things. His production work is occasionally brilliant, but usually fairly ordinary. And as this 2cd dj mix indicates, his talents as a sequencer and mixer are mediocre at best. His style seems to be simply to play a record, and then another, and then another. There is little imagination or artistry in the segues, and to be frank, the garage-to-hard-house material he plays is not anything particularly original or inspiring, either. The best thing that can be said for this mix cd set is that it provides a lot of music for a low price."
5,THIS IS THE ONE!,"I just bought this volume 2 of junior's! Much much better. Its great fun, even that damned Dolly Parton song on CD2! Great fun this summer. I highly recommend it."
4,The Tribal Beats Do It,"While Junior's days of residency at Twilo are over, one can relive them with this CD. Junior lives up to his reputation, and as a result is the highest paid DJ in the world. The first disc mixes phat tribal beats w/ junior's garage/jungle, adn lets it rip. Junior throws down an amazing intro. to meet her at the Love Parade, and along with the effects sets it off. WHile the second disc is a little (a lot) tamer, the music feels more controlled. While I haven't seen Junior live in a while, I still like to look back on those days, especially when he was a resident at Sound Factory before it became Twilo."
3,Beginners' astrology book written in present-day English.,"This book is recommended for astrological novices and those with a general interest in metaphysics. Casey manages to put a fresh face on the main components of astrology (signs, houses, aspects; but the majority of the book is devoted to the planets) in present-day english and with a decent sense of humor. Casey incorporates mythology and beliefs from around the world to give her writing a well-rounded and comprehensive feel. She also gives equal time to both the benefic and malefic influences of each of the planets. Those with more than a beginner's level knowledge of astrology will probably be somewhat disappointed with this book, as its focus is on the psychological and spiritual. A well-written chapter with some chart examples would have shown readers the earthly applications of Casey's spiritual concepts, and could have made this book a much-used astrological teaching primer."
3,CUTE IS ALL YOU GET WITH THIS ONE,"Little Suzy's Zoo Music Mobile was a baby shower gift for my twins. It's cute, but that's about it. If you are looking for a long duration of a lullaby this is not the mobile to get. The lullaby is about two minutes long, which is not long enough to settle my set down. I had to get up and rewind it more often than I care to. After doing that for a couple of weeks I had to pull out one of my old mobiles that has survive three other children."
3,Wide Railed Crib Owners Take Notice,"As with most mobiles on the market this mobile shares a similar flaw. If you have wide railed crib your mobile will have to be mounted to the wall. As far as quality, the product is made nicely with no lose strings. If your heart is set on mounting this mobile to your crib I would suggest you skip this particular styled mobile. However if you can settle for a wall mount then your infant will certainly enjoy these smiling faces looking down on them."
3,Take it or leave it,"I could take this or leave it. I bought it for our church nursery since we were going with an animal theme. It is really cute, and the babies love the music and animals, but that's about the only positive thing about it. Assembly leaves a little something to be desired. The instructions are kind of vague. Plus, the decoration on the music box part was a sticker that you have to stick on yourself. The old kids tried to peal it off. It is not very sturdy when fastened to the crib. It might be better fastened to a wall, but it seems to want to slip a little when fastened to the crib. It was very hard to get the pieces to fit together without a lot of help. I give this item points for cuteness and entertaining the kids, but I'm not crazy about the ease of assemblly and the sturdiness/durability. It is not made out of the best or thickest material. It is OK, but I think I'd choose something else if I had it to do over again."
1,10-22 ruger scope,did not send the scope shown in the picture and there was no mounting rail included as shown in the picture
3,Hasnt arrived but.....,"Ok. I have ordered this scope. I have others. First off. It's only 40 bucks. Come on nay Sayers. The free hardware makes it worth it alone. Also it's a stub scope not made for distances in extreme. Go price a leopold. 40 $ can't beat it. I will write later when it comes. and also it says ""BLUED"" to all the scope pros on here. What color is you're rifle after you blue it?"
3,OK for starters or Children,"This scope is very basic and of low/medium quality. On mine the cross hairs were not aligned properly. Also, when the scope in on the pic rail, the supplied lens covers will not fit on the ends of the scope. Another thing to consider is that the area in which to adjust the positioning of the scope in the rings is very small. The rings barely fit on the scope tube and leave you with maybe a quarter inch to move it front or back. As you can see in the picture, the only real way to adjust the scope is to move it on the pic rail.If this scope is for someone just starting to shoot or for children then it is acceptable, if it is for someone else, then maybe not. I used the rail and rings and swapped the scope for another."
1,NOT COLOR SHOWN COMES BLUE,WAS NOT COLOR SHOWN IN PICTURE PICTURE SHOWS SILVER IT CAME BLUE I HAVE A STAINLESS RIFLE SO CANT USE IT YOU NEED TO CHANGE PICTURE COLOR
1,color blind,"This scope shows as being silver in color, but when it arrived from the seller (The Global Sportsman) it was black in color. A phone call to the seller proved fruitless for customer satisfaction as they insisted the color was black as shown. They agreed to to exchange it for a silver one but I had to return it at my own expense."
3,10/22 scope,A little more power and this would be a great scope. The scope came mounted 90 degrees off top dead center. It required extra work to get it turned and rest on the rifle. The scope help a good shooter punch out the center of any target.
4,"Good shoe, but get a larger size!","This is a good deal, but as others have stated, it is smaller than normal. The last time I got a pair of Skechers it was 8 , so I figure I'd order 9 this time based on the other reviews. That was a mistake. I returned it for a 10 and it fits fine. So order 1 to 1 size larger.This is my fist dress boot and I noticed that they do not fit as snug as slip-ons, but that's probably inherent in the boot design itself. Anyway, the boot is well constructed. The heel and sole look like they are hard, but they are very soft, so it is comfortable."
2,"ok., really tight at the front","for $30, i guess i cant complain but this are not good looking or comfortable shoes"
4,is this mudbone cooper from the rubber band?,p funk has always been about doing the unexpected and mudbone proves that on this release if you're expecxting some bootsy rubber band stuff try elsewhere it's cool to see mudbone try other musical stryles and you have to be open minded to truly get into this.
5,Solid Product,This product was easy to install and will be used for years to come. I have a cold air intake with a cone filter that it keeps nice and dry.
4,Exceptional CD,"I gave the B2k debut 4 stars, because the songs are exceptionally written (thanks to B2K's older ""brothers"" IMx) and they boys' vocal skills are beautiful. Though there are certain tracks you can choose to skip over during your daily run of the cd, there are enough good songs on this cd to keep any teenager boppin' their head and singing along. Particular tracks that stand out vocally are ""Why I Love You"", ""I'm Not Finished"" and ""Feel this Way."" Even so, tracks such as ""Your Girl Chose Me"" (though a favorite are mine) and ""Here We Go Again"" are basically only appreciated by hard core B2K fans. Either way, I recommend this cd very much, because these boys have skills!"
3,Alright debut,"I didn't find this album to be all that great. Of course, I was like 16 when this group came out and I was sprung. But songs like ""Uh Huh"", ""Gots 2 Be"", and ""Why I Love You"" were big hits and songs I loved and peeps loved. Also I like ""Fantasy"" and ""B2K Is Hot"". So yeah if you want it you be the judge."
4,Could be Better,"I would've gave this album 3 out of 5, but I have to admit that the songs are catchy. I'm kinda disappointed with them when they perform live. They're no different than Britney Spears - they lip sync! I only seen them actually sing once, and I think that they need more work on it. Anyway, they're all goodlooking, and have the potential of being a really good R&B group. But I'd respect them more if they wrote their own songs (except for lil fizz cuz he writes his own rap parts). For their next album, I hope they would just try to do some of their own stuff. I know that if they try hard enough, they could make something better than this. This album mostly attracts the 12-15 year olds out there.If you're one of the people who just listens to music just for what it is, then buy this. The songs are catchy, but I think it attracts young teenage girls more. Anyway, I hope that their next album will be more impressive than this one and will show off their talents a little more."
3,It's ok,"This cd is ok and I really love some of the songs on here like Feel this way,Here we go again,last boyfriend, gots ta be,and Why i love you.But the rest of the songs seem to be the same springy dancing pop R&B songs about what their dream girl would be like.If you really love B2k you should pick up this album but if not then maybe you should just go pick up the singles."
2,It was okay...nothing that outstanding,"Not that I was expecting anything spectcular, but I was hoping for something with a little more originality. B2K doesn't do much to separate themselves from regular teen r-n-b boybands that come and go. They're very very handsome and cute (well Omarion and J-Boog) but other than that they don't bring much to the table. The songs are enjoyable, but contradicting. Some material seems too mature for them, while others seems too young. I believe and hope once they find their theme ( and stop letting the annoying lil' fizz say his name on every damn track) they may have something to listen to."
4,Cute,This album is very good even though the boys of B2k only wrote one song it still is very good. My favorite sing on the album is Undestanding my least favorite is Your girl choose me I think the boys are acting a little too cocky on this track but for the most part I think the album is great.
1,I Don't Get These Cats (corrected version),"My 9th grade class enjoyed rewriting one of the reviews of this CD so much because it had more mistakes in it than any of them had ever seen in one paragraph before. I told them their writing was bad, but now they don't feel so bad reading this horrible reviews of this band. So read the corrected version they made:Yeah, I bet you're saying this is another person that hates B2K. No, it isn't even like that, but truthfully, they can't sing. What do you think helped them sell, their nice voices? No, it's the image; that's all the music industry is about. Those cats have the image, so all they have to do is make a few decent songs, and POW! There you go; you made it big. No hating from me although I wish them well and everything, but I'm not a fan. I just think that B2K sells their image, not talent nowadays. This CD really got a zero from me, but I couldn't give it that."
2,OK MAYBE IT'S NOT SO BAD!!! (2.5 stars),"I guess there are some decent songs on B2K's self-titled debut. I obviously liked GOTS TA BE and UH-HUH, but there were some others I liked as well such as I'M NOT FINISHED and COME ON. Overall, I didn't really like the album because there weren't enough slow songs. Most boy bands of the past are known for their slow songs. There were only about three of them!I've never heard ""Pandemonium!"", but if you buy a B2K album, I suggest buying that one. But if you're a die hard fast song fan, I definitely suggest B2K's debut effort!"
1,Not Feelin' It,"What's going on, here? When the Jackson 5 started out, they were subject to RIGOROUS rehersals and nonstop practicing. Nowadays, cookie cutter teen acts like B2K need nothing more than a hype machine, a good stylist, and a flashy video director to help sell a million copies. Maybe these kids need to speak with Michael Jackson, the original child star, about learning to pay your dues before you make it big! This record really upsets me, for they are singing songs that are far beyond their years. Listen, shorties: drop the mike and go to school and complete your education. Pave the way for your future, because this record ain't doin' it."
5,B2K!!!Boyz of 2002 Best boy group besides IMX,"I am here first to tell you that the new B2K c.d. is off the hook!!! I don't even think it is necessary to go through all of the tracks on the album, it would just be better to say that the c.d. as a whole is very good. ""Uh huh"" is still my favorite song on the c.d., but all the others are very good. If you like IMX, you will LOVE B2K!!! I am a huge fan but I was very judgemental while listening to the c.d., but I like every song on the c.d. The guys are hot, the songs have great beats...I can't tell you how happy I am that the c.d. was what I excepted. This c.d. is worth your money!!!Buy it!!! i luv omarion"
2,what up ?,"hi my name is vanessa and i think that u guys got the best group around and people all ways got something to about this nice group.i love u omarion ,j bogg,raz b,lil fizz"

1,I dont get this cats,Yeah i bet u sayin this another hater on b2k naw it aint even like that but naw they doing there thing making the money. but truthfully they cant sing what u think help them sell there nice voices naw its the image thats all the music industry is about now they cats got the image so all they gotta do is make a few decent songs and there u go u made it big.No hating from me though i wish em well and everything but i aint a fan of em i just think that u sell of ur image not talent nowadays.This cd really got a zero from me but i couldnt give it that
5,The cutiest and most talented group of the Millinneum,"The reason I gave this group five stars is because that's exactly what I believe they deserve. I love the way they dance, rap, and sing. I love their music and the way they present themsleves. I love their new song the most, ""Why I Love You."" They all look good, but out of the whole group I like lil Fizz the most. I hope they're working on another song and that it's coming out soon.God Bless,Baby Girl"
4,...,"B2K is a very good hip hop/r&b group. They touch into stuff that our generation is going through. It 's nice to know that you are not alone. They are very creative,talented, and good looking. I saw them on MTV's Dismissed and I really got to see how they really are and seem very nice and that they like to have fun. ..."
4,RazB is mad hot!!(B2K 4sho),"Yo what's up?!?!?! To all da peeps thats thinking about gitting dis C.D. go get it yo. I mean the C.D. is not off da hook,but it's not bad either. Thats why I gave it a 4. It has a couple of bad traks on der like:'Fantasy'&'Your Girl Chose Me'. But all of da reast of da songs are tight!! My favoriot song on der is:'Feel This Way' cause my baby Raz sings on da song.N-EWays its a GOOD C.D. So go pick it up &support my baby Mario,Omari,Druex&Jarell. Oh,and could ya.......HOLLA BACK!!!!! And I'm Out!!!!!! RAZ-B 4LIYFE!!!!!!"
2,Boyz II Men for the future? I hope not!,"Overly-produced, utterly mainstream schlock that all the young impressionable hip-pop fans will just love. Sure, get street cred, lose artistic ability just to please the masses. This is what is wrong with the music industry. Music is art, not just entertainment. This is schlock."
5,B2K!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i luv dis ablum its da greats i got da pandemonium special edition cd. yall remember boog is ma bro iightholla michelle houston dat is ma real last name
2,average,"It is the same sound that all the other r&b boy groups have. The only thing ""unique"" about this group is that they just hit puberty. This album is pretty good. They have great ballads and a few good dance joints. Of course ""Uh Huh"" is the highlight of the album, but B2K is Hot is not a bad track. It's an average cd, but a good debut."
4,More than Capable,A new author whose first mystery captured my attention. Highly recommended for those who enjoy a mystery that has a touch of the thriller and a smidgen of romance. Well developed characters and an intriguing plot. I'm looking forward to reading more by this author.
4,Not All Accidents Are Accidents,"Belinda Lawrence has had very little contact with her great aunt, so she was a bit surprised to receive a note requesting that she come by for a visit. Unfortunately, the visit was a bit too late as Belinda discovered her aunts body days dead on the floor at the bottom of the stairs.Though called an accident by the police, Belinda sees things a little differently especially since the letter requesting the visit had been mailed after her aunts supposed accident.With some quirky and other eerie characters, the author weaves a tale that has the reading turning the pages even though you think you have it figured out, you still want to see if Kavanagh was only teasing the reader or if there really was something afoot in this very dark village far away from the city light with overgrown gardens and mystery chambers."
4,Union Starter Drum Set,"Very nice set, not for children over about 9 or 10 years old, small. Made of wood, easy to assemble. Great for beginners."
3,Dogs love it but still scratch,My dogs love this supplement but it hasn't relived the chronic itching.
3,HATE the new packaging bottle!,"My dogs love the liver taste. They fight to lick the spoon I use to put it in their food. Their coat is always shiny; it helps with the itching and loss of hair. I, however, really HATE the new bottle it comes in. The other one, you could actually grip the bottle and pour with no problem. This one, no matter where you grab the bottle, product squeezes out the top, product runs down the bottle making a gooey mess everytime; plus the old bottle was more appealing to the eye. This one is ugly, no appeal and asthetically wrong. Pls go back to the old bottle or at least make another one that has better grip. I'm going to have to find another bottle to pour the product in so I can use it better."
4,omega 3,"Vets best vitaderm is the second bottle I ordered, the first one I purchased at a local store and liked that it helped my bichon, the first bottle was called something different but it was the same ingredients, when i ordered it I thought thats what i was getting and its the same stuff just has same names. at any rate it works well to help her dry skin. lasts a long time its like an oil texture."
5,"Shiny coat, healthy skin and great appetite stimulant","It is true that it is not a cure all for itchy dog. Our dog has atopic dermatitis and is well managed with a long acting (non-drowsy) antihistamine, frequent baths and this product. This product has really helped with the skin's appearance (less hives and red bumps) and has improved her coat's appearance. What is great about it is she loves the taste! I can give her antihistamine in her dry food if I just saturate it with Vita-Derm. That is a big plus. It is also great for finicky eaters as an appetite stimulant. All dogs really seem to love it.July 14, 2011 I have to amend my original review. Although I still love what is inside the bottle, I HATE the bottle itself. After 2 uses, kit becomes a sticky mess and always drips everywhere. The old bottle worked great. Please ditch this awful bottle! I would downgrade the product to 3-4 stars because it really is annoying and messy."
1,didn't work,"This product didn't work. My dog has severe skin problems which intensify when the seasons change. Constant itching and skin licking. We have tried many products with little success. The vita-derm made her itching worse and licking a lot worse. We gave her the recommended dosage daily and used the whole bottle. The product also gave our dog horrible gas. For a dog with severe allergies, don't waste your time or money with vita-derm."
1,A big disappointment.,"I received this ""locket"" in the mail yesterday. It is teeny-tiny and gold filled. I believe I paid $55.00 + shipping for a piece of cheesy costume jewelry, that used to be available in a Five & Ten store. I was hoping this gift would become an heirloom that she could pass down to her own little girl. I am afraid it is a piece of junk. It would behoove the vender to say in the ad that it is gold filled. The locket is so miniscule that I can't imagine any photo or piece of a photo fitting in it. Quel dommage!!!"
2,NOT THE BEST BAG!,The Lansinoh bags worked better for me. They are designed with a ziplock closure method vs the twist tie Medela method. They store flat and thaw much faster in the refrigerator than the Medela bags. I have also had concerns over the use of unsanitary scissors to open the Medela bags and have experienced leaks. I have been pleased with the Lansinoh bags.
4,"Bags are good, but they leak","I really liked the idea of using these bags and did for about a week until one of them was punctured (not sure how, but when I thawed it, milk was leaking). The one thing I loved about the bags was the milk thawed a lot faster in the bags than if the milk was in a bottle. I never attached the bags to the pump. Instead, I pumped into the Medela bottle and then poured it into the bag. It worked just fine and I didn't mind the extra step or having to wash a bottle."
2,Not worth it,"I really liked the Medela products at first, but I never really liked these bags, mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them. If you get too much milk in the bag, it will leak when you close it up. Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked, causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean. Plus, the bag got stuck in the puddle.I have also used the Gerber bags, and I liked those much better."
1,Don't waste your money,"These bags are horrible. I didn't really like the way it closes, it is so easy for the milk to spill out and I can't afford for that to happen after pumping for so long. Another thing is that it can't stand by itself, doesn't have a handle to hold while pouring the milk into the bottle and I hate the way the way the milk has to be emptied from the bag. It just didn't work for me. I prefer first years storage bags because they have zip locks, a handle to hold while pouring and it can stand by itself. Another plus with these bags is that I ziplock the bags right over my pis advanced and pump right into it. You don't need these medela sucky bags to do that.It makes no sense to cry over spilt milk"
4,Easy to Use,"While I haven't tried other brands, I will say that these bags seem pretty darn sturdy and easy to use, with the ounces shown on the sides. The only thing I don't like about them, is the little ""funnel"" at the bottom of the bag that you're supposed to tear and use to pour the milk into the bottle. For one thing, you need scissors to tear the tab open (which isn't very sanitary) and then you have to use scissors again, or your teeth to actually tear the plastic to get the milk to come out. It usually rips abruptly causing the milk to spill all over. I tried over and over thinking I was just being stupid, but I finally decided it is MUCH easier to simply take off the twist tie and pour from the top of the bag!All in all though, they work just fine and even have a space at the bottom to write in the date you pumped."
2,What? Puncture resistant?,"I didn't actually purchase these but got I think 25 of them free with my Medela Pump In Style. Love the pump, hated the bags. I've had a few of them come with holes in them. As we all know breastmilk is liquid gold, so these baggies cost me precious milk. Now I just pump into the provided bottles--which I mainly use for storage--then use Gerber freezer bags for freezer storage. The Gerber bags are self-standing and they have a zipper seal, which is so much better than fooling with those stupid twist ties that the Medela bags use. Bottles are much easier to attach to your pump. I hate to say anything bad about Medela, but I wouldn't recommend spending actual money on these by themselves."
2,Prefer Lansinoh,"I registered for and received these Medela bags. After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase. Wow!! I will never go back to Medela. The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak. Well this is the only good feature. The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top. With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that. My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that. But neither has my Lansinoh bag."
1,A one star review gives this product too much credit.,"I initially tried these bags because all my other experiences with Medela products were great. However, Medela missed the mark on this one. The twist tie bag closure design is horrible and more expensive compared to other brands.I decided to go with the Gerber storage bags instead and I like them 100% better. I have never had a problem freezing any milk with the Gerber bags and thawing the milk is easy using the sealed pouch design, we use the coffee maker and the bags hold up well immersed in just the hot water. The Gerber bags are sold everywhere and you get more for your money per bag."
2,Hard to use,"I personally preferred the Lansinoh bags, they seem more sanitary, are easier to write on and close easier. These weren't bad, I just found something better!"
3,"okay, but could be improved","I registered for these baggies, because I had the Medela pump in style double electric pump. These bags were supposed to fit directly to the pump. They don't. They don't make a good enough seal for the pump to work. I still had to pump into the bottles and then pour them into the baggies. I have had no problems with leaking. The twist ties are a bit unhandy, but overall the baggies are good. I don't know if they are worth the price though. My suggestion: try other brands."
2,"Clumsy design, hard to use","These bags leave a lot to be desired. They don't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them. They don't lie down flat, so you can't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer. The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on. And I've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors, which I'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice, sterile inside. All in all, I'm really disappointed in these bags, and the only positive side to them is I haven't had any burst in the freezer...yet."
4,Medela vs Gerber vs Lansinoh,"The Medela bags absolutely work best with the Medela pump. Also, they seal well and are easy to write on in the white space provided.Gerber bags are Zip Loc and are less expensive, but difficult to write on and you must use a rubberband or masking tape or something to hold it on the pump. I use masking tape, then label the masking tape to put it on the bag.The Lansinoh bags cost the same as the Gerber ones and have a DOUBLE Zip Loc seal and white space for writing. I guess I like these best since I am frugal, but I just wish they'd attach to the Medela Pump Easier."
1,Absolute Mess,"If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you. First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself. Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out. It's not that easy. The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk. Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there. The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk. This never happened with the other bags on the market. My favorite is lansinoh. Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others. Pass on this and try others."
2,Too cumbersome,"The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them. The execution, however, is lousy. Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying.I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal. Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy."
2,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with these storage bags. I prefer to use the other brands that offer ziplock type closure. This brand is harder to close, more time consuming and wasteful (due to spilling)"
2,Prefer Gerber bags,"After using both these bags and the Gerber bags, I prefer the zipper-style closure of the Gerber bags. I've never had a problem with those leaking or ruining my milk. They are also much cheaper as you can generally find them at discount stores (Target, etc.)."
1,Sour Milk; Devastated Mom,"These bags seemed perfect, as I was unable to breastfeed my son and was pumping full-time for him. Sometimes I would have extra milk at the end of the day, so I froze it using these bags and also some Avent freezer bags that I had. Once I stopped breastfeeding, I went to use the frozen milk that was remaining in the freezer (I had been using it up slowly as I decreased my milk supply, so none of the milk was in there longer than 2 or 3 months), and to my dismay 90% of the milk in the medela bags was complelety sour. The Avent bags, though they didn't fit on my Lactina pump, worked for 100% of the milk I stored. Don't waste your money and effort on these bags. You may be sorry."
2,Most expensive and least useful,I started off with the Medela bags but one day they fell to the side and spilled 13 oz of milk in the little black carrier and into my work bag. Then I moved onto the Gerber ones with zip lock but were not spill-proof either. Then tried the Lansinoh which have a double zip lock system and those can be carried upside down and not a drop is lost. Also cheaper than Medela.
4,Compact and Convenient for use with Medela Pump in Style,"I use a Medela Pump in Style and use these bags when I am low on bottles. I much prefer to pump into bottles and use the bags for storage in the freezer/refrigerator. This is especially useful when I'm traveling and don't want to lug too many bottles with me. I always keep a stack of them along with the Medela sterilizer bags with my pump (along with the spare battery case, A/C adapter, and Car charger). Everything fits great. The twist tie seal isn't the easiest thing in the world but it definitely keeps the bags compact and is pretty good and easy to use. The only spill/leak I ever had was my own error. If you're worried about it spilling in the fridge, I suggest keeping the bags upright in a clean bowl so that they are not laying on their sides and having more pressure on the seal - it keeps the bags from getting smushed by other items and also ensures that the bags are kept in a safe, clean space in the fridge."
1,Horrible bags! They always leak and are hard to handle.,"This is a horrible system! The picture on the package shows them using some kind of screw top on the top of the bag, but that's misleading. There is no such thing in the package. The package consists of nothing but the bags and wire twist ties. In order to use the bags, you have to peel open their top seal, which leaves the entire top open and unsealed! You are then supposed to use the wire ties to close the bag. Well, I don't think that's all that great! Once they have milk in them they are very awkward to handle because the don't stand up due to the ""convenient"" spout on the bottom. The spout doesn't actually tear open either, you have to cut it with scissors, which means, if you're not fast enough to pull your scissors back, then the milk will run over them. And if you don't hold them upright, then the milk will start to leak out of the top that's basically open except for the little wire tie. Bad design! I'd never buy those again."
2,Didn't like - Used First Years bags or Mother's Milk bottles,I had some of these that came with my Medela pump and like some other reviewers I thought they would be a good deal since I've really liked my Medela pump. I really didn't like using them with the twist ties. That didn't make sense to me at all. I tried the First Years that have a zip-loc top and they've worked better. They sit on their own and don't need to be set in a cup!I do prefer using bottles to store milk and have found the Mother's Milk Mate storage bottles to be a great cheap alternative for storage bottles.
4,Good bags,"I like the strength of these bags, much nicer than Gerber. The twist ties could be improved upon, but I never had milk leak. I did find the Gerber bags easier to seal."
1,Don't waste your money,"I've been pumping and freezing for 7 months now and LOVE my Medela pump. But I don't know what they were thinking when they made these bags. I only pumped directly into them once, but I hated having to hold the cones of the breastpump. It's a lot easier to hold the bottles while pumping. I got the Gerber bags after seeing reviews months ago & they are sooo much better. I still have about 46 Medela bags to use (got 2 packs of them), but I've been through at least 100 Gerbers and never had a problem with them. The twist tie system is a pain & will not allow the bags to freeze flat. So if you plan on storing more then a couple of bags, they take up a lot of room in the freezer. For every 1 Medela bag, I can fit two Gerbers. Also, if you store a lot of milk like I do I recommend using an ice cube tray. You can store them vertically & in date order, like a filing system in your freezer. Putting the newest in the back."
2,OKAY FOR EMERGENCIES,"I bought these bags thinking that I would be using them alot but I only found myself using them when I did not have any more bottles left. I didn't really like them because when I pour the milk out, I notice that I don't get everything out so easily. I keep extra bags in my car, at work or in my bag in case I forget to pack a bottle or I run out and I need something to store my breast milk. But that hardly ever happens because I definately prefer storing milk in the bottles."
2,Found these bags difficult although milk freezed well,I had been using the lansinoh milk storage bags and ran out so I tried these bags. I found them very hard to use. The Lansinoh bags have a zip top like the gerber bags yet I have not had a problem with them leaking. I was very dissappointed in these bags since you have to place them in a cup and they are awkward and don't lay flat when frozen. I have a supply of milk in my freezer and if I couldn't lay them flat I would have no room for my other freezer items. I was extremely happy with the lansinoh bags and would reccommend them instead of these.
1,Medela vs. Lasinoh,"The Lasinoh bags have a double ziplock and are cheaper too. Also you can find Lasinoh bags at more stores such as K-Mart, etc. The twist ties with the Medela bags are a pain and I never used them to pump in anyway."
2,Not the best on the market,"While these are easy to use when you are pumping, they tie on the pumps nice and snug, they are not the best for storing. The tie doesn't make it leakproof and there can be spillage if they tip before they freeze.A better bag is the Gerber seal and go bag. They fit on the pump but you'll need to either hold the bag so it doesn't slip or use a rubberband to hold it in place. But, the reason it's better is because it's a ziplock bag. So, it seals tight and there's no spilling. The best part about these bags is if you freeze them, you can store them in the freezer lying down so you can have thin bags stacked up, keeping room in your freezer for food for the rest of the family."
1,Gerber Vs. Medela? I vote Gerber,"I've tried lots of storage bags, and by far the Medela ranks the lowest. These spill, you have to store them upright in the freezer...and if your freezer is as compact as mine with food to feed five people, storing milk upright is just too hard to do. These bags do NOT have a ziplock seal on them, which means that they are leaky and unreliable if you are in a hurry (like if you have more than one kid and you work).Buy the Gerber or the Lansinoh bags with the zip seals on them. They can both be stored flat for more convenience, and they can stand on their own. Pumping into a bag is fine if you are someone who wants to fumble with attaching it to the pump (the Medela bags), or you can use your Medela pump with your reliable pump kit and pour your milk into a Gerber or Lansinoh storage bag for ease. I use the Medela Lactina Plus, and I find that this method works the best for me. Simple, clean and easy."
1,You will cry over spilled milk,"I purchased these bags when I returned to work and began pumping more often. What a waste!! The twist tie design is both clumsy and ineffective. You can never tie them tight enough and spills are frequent. In additon to this, the cost is ridiculous. The Gerber bags with the zip lock design are much more economical and are leak proof. They can be found at most retail stores including Target and Walmart. These bags do not measure up to the Medela name and they should consider a new design. Returning to work and continuing to nurse your baby is hard enough without the hassle of these bags."
2,not easy to use,"I bought these to store milk before I went back to work. They work fine when I'm home with all the time in the world. I've back to work for 4 days and find these bags very time consuming...opening the bag, threading the twist tie, attaching it to the shield, pumping, deattaching it, and closing it. Pumping can take up to 25 minutes. Not something that can happen 2-3 times a day. And I'm never sure how much I've pumped. When the bag is attached to the shield it says 1 thing, but then you seal it up and it says anothers. Today, I'm going to buy bottle set. They close just as tight and are much easier to use."
1,"Another, better option-Pumpmate breastmilk storage liners","My sister-in-law swore by Medela bags and they worked for her, however, we looked at them in stores and saw how they were to be used, and decided against them. I think that these and other bags like them are more complicated than they need to be.We have been using Pumpmate storage liners and found them to be much easier and simpler to use. They are shaped like playtex disposable drop-in liners and the starter kit comes with a screw-on adapter to use with your pump so you can pump directly into the liners. (You can also use it to pump directly into a playtex disposable nurser with a drop-in liner for fresh milk) It's as easy as pumping into a collection bottle. You can then seal it, freeze, thaw and feed directly from the same bag! No pouring involved!The Pumpmate liners are comprably priced to Medela bags and are so much easier and simpler to use!"
1,Twist ties??,"I find these bags really hard to use. Sure it's great you can pump right into them, BUT they don't stand up on their own and the twist tie closures are REALLY hard to use. I've used (and highly recommend) Lansinoh bags which work really well."
1,Terrible product for milk storage,I started using these bags that came with my Pump in Style pump and HATED THEM. I feel like writing Medula and telling them they need to rethink their design. They expect you to be able to attach the bags to the pump things with a twist tie and then manipulate them without getting milk all over. The instructions actually say to prop them up in a cup or something to prevent from leaking??? Im sorry but pumping is a chore in itself and there is nothing worse than opening your freezer to LEAKED milk that you painstakingly gathered. Try the Gerber brand bags..they have a neat zip lock top and you can safely stack them on top of each other in the freezer!!
2,Not a Big Fan,I had received these with my pump and although it may be nice to use them I found buying the bottles that fit on the end of the pump much easier and then i could combine the milk and place it in a storage container for the fridge or freezer. Also I am not one to spend money needlessly so instead of buying all of these expensive storage containers I found the Avent Via and just cheap gerber bottles with disks on the top the best and cheapest way to store breastmilk. And it helps if you intend on having a huge supply stored.
3,Not that great,I did not like these too much. It seems a little too much work to close it in order to freeze the milk. I liked the Gerber ones better because they have the sealable feature.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my son for Christmas as an alternative to the overpriced Transformers ... what a disappointment. The pieces are difficult to put together and don't stay together. The water has to be just the right temperature for it to change colors. And the color changing spots are just that - spots on the hood, the fenders, and the doors. I learned my lesson and should have stuck with the original Hot Wheels ""type"" cars."
3,Hollow be Thy Duane,"The Barbie documentary has a compilation of scenes depicting an enriched structure how the kids fashion was back then.A serious of topics were discussed a scene encompassing singers and models and anyone in particular.A captivating moment of the video was the discussion on what trends do kids follow...Alas, there was the now legendary Duane explaining how he observed the graphical representations of magazine or simply seeing what the kids in school were wearing.Overall, the video has one of the most enriching moments inspiring an online generation with the Duane dance whilst reforming the church of Duane ""hollow be thy Duane"". Great documentary of the late 80's!"
2,Two Stars Seems Appropriate,"Yes, this is a cartoon book about breasts. There are no actual photographs, the cartoons are reminiscent of cave drawings, and the text is somewhat stilted (perhaps it's the translation) and often hilarious (whether intentional or not). For those who don't know (and I hope this isn't considered a ""spoiler""), breasts (at least the female version) are useful--particularly for babies. Lots of babies get milk from a mamma's breast and this book covers the process nicely and with simple words and (even simpler) drawings. If you want to teach a young child about breasts, this may be the book for you."
2,Interesting but limited,"Despite many facts updating Thomas Verny's The Secret Life of the Unborn Child, an expectant parent finishes this book saying,""So what?"" All the data does really not provide a useful direction for its evidence that the fetus is capable of learning. However, I found that my two children vastly benefitted from the prenatal enrichment system described by Dr. Sarah Brewer in her recent book, Super Baby, with its compelling documentation for the product called BabyPlus (see [...]), which as a nurse I would urge that parents-to-be consider."
5,Premium t-shirt,"This shirt is made from outstanding material, front and back silkscreen design, soft cotton. Great!"
5,"If you don't own this, buy this album...now","In my opinion this is one of the best albums ever made, I suggest it to anyone that like electronic or hip hop music. This album feature the Jungle brothers, De la soul and more as guest vocalists. This is in the top five on my list of music to own. These guys are incredable, I pick up anything buy them I can."
3,"Some good ones, some bad ones","I just bought this CD mainly for ""Spybreak!"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" and these two songs are still my favorites on the CD. I first heard Spybreak (a shorter version) on the Matrix soundtrack, and liked it quite a bit.After listening straight through, I found that the songs on this CD are best for listening to as background music-- apparently, this music is supposed to be for clubs anyway, so this makes sense. The techno has a wide range, from hip-hoppy tracks to the cabaret-style ""History Repeating"" to movie-soundtrack songs like ""Spybreak!"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (a mix of OHMSS from some Bond movie I can't remember).Anyway, the point is if you like some techno, you'll probably like at least several of these songs.BTW, I found that the clips on this page are not at all representative of the music I liked most, so if you don't like the clips given, you could still easily enjoy the CD overall."
4,I had to buy this,"A co-worker demanded I listened to this album. So during my break I did, I rushed out & bought it right after work. As a huge De La fan I no doubt loved 360. 360 & Bigger? are the highlights of this worthy cd."
4,"Not quite avant-garde, but good nevertheless","What struck me immediately about this CD is the brisk, clean production of it all. It's all very much in-your-face. The sound is clear and sometimes even cold.Someone earlier on complained about the cheesy samples and breakbeats used... and actually he is right. I am an amateur breabkeat-musician myself and would have thought at least twice about using many of the samples on the CD. Also those hysterical bass-synth licks as for example in ""Echo And Bounce"" (2nd track) are quite corny... and they use it so much! Nevertheless, the Propellerheads have a great feel for GROOVE, mixed with almost impeccable arrangement talent. They also were smart enough to use a real drummer on most of the tracks. It is this what makes the album stand out, not the electronic wizardry.So all in all, a good album, bringing Big Beat to the masses."
4,Pretty good for what it is meant to be,"Not for everyone but a nice techno type album. Songs structures very similar to Art of Noise: each instrument has a very catchy lick that repeats every one or two bars, and then every four or eight bars an instrument/sound effect is added or subtracted. The song progresses by adding or subtracting these 4-8 bar instrument/effect ""modules""; there is no soloing or melodic breaks or anything like that. Vocals are basically sound effects that are inserted/subtracted as are the instruments. Occasionally there is rapping/vocals but even these are quite repetitive. The main difference is that the drums and bass are very funky. Good textures and sound effects are key, and this album sports a variety. Not meant for deep analysis, but rather as background music with instantly catchy hooks."
5,Decksanddrumsandthiskicksass!,"Well, I don't actually own this CD, and that I'm working on. But I do know a bit about the Propellorheads. For one On Her Majesty's Secret Service has not been used in any James Bond Movie (however another of thier songs was, can't seem to find it) but was created for the James Bond Music Project (something like that) which is basically remixes of some old Bond tunes. The cd itself had some other mixes, including one by Iggy Pop, but none were very outstanding, beside OHMSS. Anyhow, Take California was recently used in the movie Any Given Sunday, so pretty soon you'll be able to buy the whole Propellorheads CD on soundtracks. These are all great dance hits, and I rate them just as good as Fatboy Slim and Moby."
1,This one bites!,"After reading all the raving reviews I decided to go out and buy this album. Man o' man the tracks on here could be mistaken for elevator music! Too much repetition and not a single track stood out. I take that back, Jag is using ""History Repeating"" in its commercials. What a joke."
1,My feelings on this CD.,"I would like to get started, and say one thing; I did not buy this CD on amazon.com, but I have listened to the whole cd. I first heard it shortly after it came out, after my friends were raving about it. Frankly, I was not impressed. It was one of the very few times I have raised the question, is the whole world on mind-altering substances? Quite too frequently I hear people complaining about elevator music. In my opinion this is so close to elevator music, it is scary. Sadly, my friends who made me listen to this CD also hate elevator music. I am a fan of The Chemical Brothers, Prodigy, and Crystal Method. I was shocked to find that quite a few people who bought the Crystal Method CD also bought this CD. I do not think that Crystal Method and Propellerheads sound alike."
2,Not the Chemical Brothers,"Although ""Take California,"" ""Bang On,"" ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" and ""Spybreak"" are all very good tracks, especially for dancing, this cd is not very good as a whole. The music is very repetitive, and not fit for repeat listening. Once you get to ""History Repeating"" you look at the irony in the name of the song, because history, and beats, have been repeating for a very long time. Although the album on a whole isn't very good, ""A Number of Microphones"" is awesome and made me want to beatbox, it is a fabulous piece of work in that field. If you want to dance a lot for a long time, then buy this album. If you want good music to dance to for a long time, look elsewhere."
1,Don't buy it!!! (You've been warned),"This one is a dog. Such a dog that it licks it's own butt.Sorry for that nasty imagery but I really feel burned by this one. I've bought over 50 electronic music CD's this past year and this easily takes the prize for ""Stinker of the Year"". I feel robbed. Why? Bad lyrics, cheesy samples, cheesy radio station ""scratched"" sample effects, last years break beats, lousy composition. Oh my God, the agony of it all!Look, in all fairness, that first track ""Take California"" is pretty cool but it's a slippery slide down hill from there. I'm a fan of what Propellerheads have done with audioware e.g. Rebirth and ReCycle. Top software really. But can't say the same about this one - can't wait to sell this one. Sigh!"
4,Definitely Decksandrumsandrockandroll,"The main reasons I bought this CD were the low price and ""History Repeating"" video. When I first listened to the entire album, I was really impressed with the texture and variety displayed on all the tracks. It also helped that the songs made me want to MOVE. My favorite tracks are ""A Number of Microphones"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" which are actually almost one track as the former melds into the latter: I tend to think of it as a REAL monster track! This album truly stands out from the rest of the pack. Personally, I try not to compare albums with one another as, for one reason or another, I'm often not too enthusuastic about the other artists they are compared to compared to. What I can say is if you're looking for fast beats and high velocity, the Propellorheads definitely have it."
3,Sample a Few Tracks First,"I always tell myself that I won't do it: that I won't buy a CD on the merit of a single song, without having heard anything from the rest of the CD.But I did anyway. I heard History Repeating in a bar, and by the next morning I'd ordered the CD. Impulsive? Yeah, and believe me it's not the norm for me.And was I disappointed? A little. I was expecting more music like History Repeating, and I didn't get it. In fact, that's the only true vocal on the CD. The rest of it is instrumental, house-style music, some of it amazingly good, some of it nearly unplayable, interspersed with a few short tracks that frankly I don't get the point of. So when I listen to it, I find myself listening to a few tracks (often 1, 2, 5, 9, and 12), then turning it off.Listen before you buy."
4,"Very good music. Good composition, performance and variety.",Personally I like this CD very much. I think it's one of the best I've bought this year. I've been making a concious effort not to listen to this CD too often. I _don't_ want to get tired of it.
5,"""He's got a nice body...he's wearing velvet pants!"" Groovy!",I heard an interview with these guys on Nat. Public Radio and liked it. I love all kinds of music...especially funk...so this electrotechnofunkadellic extraveganza is too much. I listen too it as I write computer programs...energy city. I want more!
4,"Some rap, some jazz, some techno funk = one snazzy disc","I bought this CD, as I'm so apt to do with most of my music purchases, off of the strength of one song--""History Repeating"" featuring Miss Shirley Bassey. From the first track--titled ""Take California""--I realized that I'd glommed onto a very different CD.Instead of calling the compositions on the CD techno or any other variation on that theme, I'd like to think that DECKSANDDRUMSANDROCKANDROLL may be what Jazz is headed for in the millenium. It's definitely unlike any of the other music in my collection.I found it to be an immensely satisfying listen and it'll get more than a few spins during my commute. In fact, I think that it just may be the soundtrack to my summer of 1998!"
3,what's different,"The music on this CD is enjoyable and well-built. Messrs Gifford and White are virtuoso technicians. On HISTORY REPEATING, it's easy for me to suspend disbelief enough to visualise Shirley Bassey actually in the studio with them. The horns and the drum tracks work that well together. ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and SPYBREAK!, I sense their deft touch as well. They certainly are better than most at doing what everyone else does -- it's still basically, what everyone else does, though. Some far sighted individuals were even doing this a decade ago. If you are interested in big beat done extremely well, this CD will be interesting to you."
4,two stellar songs,"The songs History Repeating and Spybreak! are awesome! History Repeating reminds me a lot of Goldfinger. The singer gets kind of throaty on the low notes. It has a very classy feel. The rest of the cd has a little bit of a techno feel. It's very upbeat - something to get you going in the morning or keep you going the last hour of work. If you liked the soundtrack to The Matrix, then you'll like this too."
5,"This is my favorite CD, i never leave home without it","This CD is amazing, it combines Jazz, Rock, and Hip-Hop into an amazing blend of sound. This is one of my favorite CDs and a must-have for anyone who likes techno music or exploring new music. Did I mention they cover James Bond stuff and even get Shirley Bassey to do vocals on one track? What more could you ask for?"
3,Original and well done. So why don't I like it?,"This is an ""all over the map"" CD. Maybe not quite as much as the Chemical Brother's Dig Your Own Hole, but it definitely covers many genres.Don't try to download a few songs and expect them to represent the album.I also found the album to vary greatly in quality. I enjoyed History Repeating, Bang On! and Spybreak! a lot, but found much of the rest of the songs to be mediocre and have less energy.I really wish I liked this album more. The short intros to each song were very fresh and original, and A Number of Microphones is hilarious. I'll probably get the next Propellerheads album just for the unique style, if not for the music.Note to Spybreak! fans: the 6 minute version of the song on this CD is definitely better than the four minute mix you'll find on the Matrix soundtrack."
4,Nice sound with a low price!!,This is a really nice Home Theater for the money. The 135 watt makes my movies sound great. Very powerful maybe to powerful. But I seen this price so I did a search and found it way lower [...] Just so you know you can save a few bucks. The Theater looks great in our living room with that true stereo Surround Sound feeling. Works for our family.
3,A tame look at the studios,"Unlike the other reviewers here, I thought the book (considering when it was written) is a bit of tame, high-level overview of the studio workings. I didn't find it boring, nor did I find it to be a great page-turner. I would have preferred a more in-depth review of the studio workings. However, it was interesting to read the names from the past and the TV shows that were described...Lost in Space, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea...and the movies...Dr. Doolittle, Planet of the Apes...and more. I did find the parts on how Richard Zanuck decided which movies would get made and which ones didn't to be interesting - pretty much a gut feeling and a whim. I think this book is only for diehard studio fans and not the casual reader of Hollywood history."
4,Reflections on a golden studio,"Although a little dated (originally written circa 1969) this is still one of the great inside stories about what goes on (or more precisely did go on) in the old Hollywood. Written about the time that the old studio system finally collapsed, it collects some great anecdotes for film buffs. Besides, it is well written."
1,Whiplash Not Worth It!,"An interesting insider's account of Hollywood. However, the endless dialogue is exhausting and makes for uncomfortable reading. More descriptive passages would have been useful."
4,Great movie book,"If you like reading about ""inside"" Hollywood, this is a book Ihighly recommend. Dunne goes inside 20th Century Fox and tells all. Actually quite funny."
4,I semi love these mats but....,"I was a tad disappointed that the lettering is not colored as shown in the picture, it is black and very hard to read because the letters blend in to the background. contrast would have been nice since the words complete the design. I'm trying to figure out how to add my own coloring to the letters. On the plus side, they arrived quickly and are quite heavy, not at all cheaply make, they lay nice and flat even in my small car. The cat is colored molded rubber vs just painted on, so I expect them to last a good long time. They look so good I bought new seat covers to dress up the rest of my car. Darn clever Amazon, promoting full car interior redecorating!"
1,You can do better for the price,This camera has relatively low quality. The software bundled with it it nearly useless. I have had nonstop problems with keeping the thing running. Maybe other people have had more luck. At this point I have given up on the mobile camera function entirely.
4,Something for everyone,"Over forty tracks!!! This whole CD is rockin', and with Bill changing things up every minute and a half, there's no way to get bored. Look at it this way... if you get sick of a track, wait a few seconds and he'll mix out."
3,This is old school music for old people by now.,Great for excercise and motivating me in the gym but the music is very hard to listen too at times and is very redundant just a few tracks and I'm done with my sets.
4,Oriole attractor,Love this oriole feeder. Have had 2 of them. The feeder holes keep the bees and ants out. Easy to clean.Only problem is it fades bad after 1-2 summers (Minnesota summer is only 4 1/2 months long). :(
3,oriole feeder,"very glad to find these as they can be hard to find in the stores....the hummingbirds also use them as do finches...There can be some leakage around the base, but the bees have a harder time getting in to them."
1,Bad Product,"This thing leaked everywhere, not at first, but gradually over a couple of weeks, it drained itself dry.Couldn't get it to stop leaking, thought about returning it, I just got frustrated and trashed it.The reason for 1 star,I did see 1 Oriole trying to use it, but just once, I never saw another one.I wouldn't recommend this product"
2,Very disappointing.,"We gave this to my husband for a gift. We hung it up, and it immediately began dripping, emptying in less than 30 minutes. We attempted to refill, tighten things up, etc., and the dripping was repeated. We would not buy this again. Very disappointed."
1,They Leak!,Bought two of these after seeing orioles at our humming bird feeders. The bottoms of each are made in two parts that screw together. The problem is that both of them slowly leak out through this joint and will become empty overnite. They are worthless!Opus 449-2 Oriole Feeder
2,Problems with design,"I purchased this oriole feeder, and when I used it the first time, I realized that the design of the upper part (that holds the nectar) caused a few problems. It has a very small opening where you fill it...so plan on using a small funnel. That's not a big deal. However....when it comes time to clean that part, it is an impossible task. If the fill opening were big enough to use a bottle brush to clean, and larger to make filling easier, it would be a good oriole feeder."
1,Scares the orioles! Waste of money.,"I was so excited to give my orioles their own feeder so they would leave my hummingbird feeders alone. This Opus feeder has ports that have plastic springs behind them to open up. Since the ports would move a little to open, it would terrify my orioles! They're very shy birds and this feeder was a waste of money. They all quickly went back to my hummingbird feeders."
2,Leaks badly after two days hanging.,"I read the reviews and decided to try this feeder anyway. I just packaged it up to return. After two days, it was leaking badly on the seam on the top of the orange bottom part. Not where the bottle screws in. I could have lived with the impossible to empty and clean the bottom piece for the price, but it has to hold liquid... Good luck if you try it anyway like I did."
3,Looks great but no orioles ever came!,I bought this feeder from Target after seeing an oriole near our regular bird feeder last spring. It shipped quickly and was easy to set up once I bought some oriole food mix. I hung it as suggested in a southwest corner but never saw an oriole come near it! I gave it a few weeks but no luck so I moved it under a tree. Maybe I put it out too late in the season and missed the migrating males this year so I'll give it another try next year. I still have it up since it looks nice but it didn't seem to attract any orioles this year. I'd give it 2 stars but I'll give it through the summer and put it up early next spring and see if anything changes.
1,Poor design!,"This feeder works fine, however, it is the most difficult thing to clean I've ever had! First of all the container is a really awkward shape. It does not fit in your hand very well due to it's wide girth. An old soda bottle would be easier to handle! Secondly, it has a very small mouth which makes it difficult to insert a bottle brush. Then on the inside there are small plastic squiggles that hold the nectar dispensing buttons on which are also difficult to clean. The other problem is emptying the bottle. It's flattened at the bottom and even with vigorous shaking you can never completely empty it.If they were to change the shape of the bottle (make it smaller in girth and widen the mouth) It could be a great product!"
1,Bees In -- Birds Gone,"I purchased this item based on its claim of the patented bee guards keeping bees out. First off it does not look like the picture, the drinking holes are round and have a small button inside that the orioles will push down to feed. Unfortunately, the bees learned within about an hour how to push the button down. They then go in to drink, can't get back out and die. The entire bottom of the feeder was full of bees within 24 hours of hanging the feeder. Does not work as intended. And is definitely not the same product shown."
4,I disagree,"The review before mine said that Progressive music is said to be cold and emotional in general. This is said by people who don't either like progressive music, or don't understand it. Progressive Music is the most emotional and warm music created if done correctly. This band is also great."
3,Deep sounds without depth,"Mellow, introspective acoustic bass jams are often repetitive in design but does display a good degree of infectious rhythm paired with the occasional technical triumphs."
3,"Item fine, shipping overpriced","The items were what I wanted and expected. The reason I ordered six of them was to have a stock on hand and avoid shipping costs. Unfortunately, the seller charged the per item price for shipping and it came out to be about twice what it should have been."
3,An old friend re-visited,"A book I read many years ago and really enjoyed.Having just read it again I found the concept still as intriguing as the first time.Mr Simak tells a good story and although it could be said this one is now a liitle old fashioned, it has a theme much more likely than the current crop of ""fantasy Sci Fi""Go on read it!!!!"
3,Portand Collection,"For me this was not a particularly good book. Probably well written, but not helpful for me."
5,"Great traditional music for mandolin, fiddle and guitar","If you enjoy traditional music such as contra dances, the two-volume Portland Collection is a great book for you. The selection of Irish, Scottish, French Canadian and other songs is very well chosen. Songs include musical score, chord annotations and a short history of the song, something not often found. The format is very convenient, with easily read pages and a size and spiral binding that makes it easy to use. We plays these songs mainly with melody on mandolin and chord accompaniment by guitar, but they also well extremely well with fiddle. Superb selection of music in either or both volumes of the Portland Collection. This is volume one - also seeA Portland Selection, Vol. 2: Contra Dance Music in the Pacific Northwest"
2,no suede in this item,"It says in the description that this piece is suede leather. I was unhappy to find that the item included no suede leather in it whatsoever. It is inexpensive, durable cloth stitched together and has a nylon feel to it, and I will use this piece. However, moving forward I will be very wary about what I buy from gifted horse, since the description did not match the piece."
1,Very disappointing,"Very disappointed in this title. We received a booklet which consisted of 8.5 x 11 in paper folded over and stapled to form an 80 page booklet.Most of the content is along the lines of what you might get from the local chamber of commerce. Some general information about the climate, a picture of the state flag, a ""Food in Hawaii"" section which lists McDonalds, Burger King, Subway... you get the picture.Information about real estate is rare and obvious. Like ""Oceanfront property can be a good investment, but careful research should be undertaken to ensure it."" I thought that's what I bought this booklet for, but that's about as detailed as it gets. You're better off just surfing the Net than to pay for this.Pass."
1,Don't waste your money,This isn't even a book; it's a stapled set of color copies. All of the information contained within can be found quickly on the Internet.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,ONE OF THE WORST DOCUMENTERIES I HAVE EVER SEEN AND I HAVE DOZENS. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
3,really cute,I bought this lamp to go in my little girls room. It matches the bedding and it is well made. The shade is adorable. It is a good size for the bedside table.
3,Cute lamp-not so great quality,"I really want to give this product 2.5 stars, the average of 1.5 stars for quality and 4 stars for design/looks. I purchased this lamp for my 3 year old son's room. It's very attractive and he loves it, but within about 6 weeks after purchase with very limited use - just at bedtime for about 30 minutes - the inner ring that attaches the lampshade to the metal rigging that goes over the light bulb and holds the shade in place tore spontaneously so that the lampshade detached from it and fell. Nobody touches the lamp, it's sitting on top of a dresser, so it must have happened as a result of the heat produced by the bulb melting or somehow damaging the tape that attached the shade to the rigging. We made sure we were using the right type of light bulb, so too much heat was not the issue. I'm disappointed, I want to like this lamp, but the quality does not match the price. I will now need to look for a solution to repair the shade or buy a new one to use the lamp again."
5,an introduction to libertarianism,"I would still not consider myself a libertarian, but this book has taught me a lot and given me much to think about. The story is a good one of the fight against evil, except the evil is the government gone bad. Even though this is fiction, there is so much in here that can teach you the way that government should work. For those of you who hate text books, this book is a fun way to learn about libertarian ideals.Recommended for those who like a good read and dont mind learning something at the same time. As you see my name is annonymous fed, so I have to say that even working for the government, I see so much that should not be. Every bad guy in the book that died deserved what he got, and I have had to re-evaluate my thoughts on many things."
5,"Outstanding storytelling, grim warnings, hopeful message","I won't go into the political overtones or the alarming ""it CAN happen here"" atmosphere that is so wonderfully embellished by Suprynowicz; hopefully by now you'll already understand that part. I'll just state simply that this is an outstanding piece of storytelling and that it is eminently worth saving pennies from your lunch money to buy."
5,Fabulous,"Do not start on this book if you have much else scheduled. You will likely find it as difficult to put down as I did. I loved this book. It gave me hope that freedom still has a chance in an increasingly unfree America. The dark cynicism from watching politics, the courts and the attitudes of the people become increasingly anti-freedom lifted reading this book.I hope it doesn't require the means employed to regain our freedom in this still wonderful but very troubled country. But I hope even more that enough people deeply understand and value freedom and that they dare to stand up and fight for freedom using any and all means necessary."
1,I'm sorry guys,"This is not an excellent anything. Its a poor shadow of Atlas Shrugged, which ISN'T THAT GOOD OF A BOOK TO BEGIN WITH.This dude also completely ripped off Alan Moore's V for Vendetta which is about, drumroll please, a masked anarchist/libertarian taking on a corrupt goverment.Seriously this book is double-plagarized, he gets one star for his enormous balls and the fact that most of you don't seem to have noticed."
5,Clear outlined approach that works!,"First, this book will supplement any High School Geometry textbook. The problems in the book range from easy to challenging (some just tedious) that will help and prepare students for tests and other standarized exams. What I really like about this book is that, it lays down all of the concepts in a very clear way without using too many words. The book should be used more as a supplement, a reminder, and a guide to help you solve problems. It's not the most colorful and fun book to read, but it is worth all your money if you are looking for a good outlined approach to the subject."
5,Easy and Fun,"""Geometry The Easy Way"" really does live up to its name. I had tried ""Geometry for Dummies"" before but I was unable to realistically teach myself the basics with that book alone. (Maybe I needed Geometry for morons!"" ""Geometry the easy way"" started out with simple concepts and slowly built upon those. The chapters were short and had numerous exercises that were very helpful. I actually discovered that geometry was fun-now that's a strange concept to grasp!I would recommend this book for anyone wanting to teach themselves the basics of geometry in a short amount of time."
1,It wasn't very detailed,I found many mathematical errors throughout this book. I didn't find it too interesting either. The editor should have read throughly this book before releasing it. The book covers some material but doesn't get into great depth.
1,This book was a blotch on Barron's record!,"I read this book along with the other books of Barron's The Easy Way series. I thought the others were much better, and introduced the subjects they covered in a better way. I especially enjoyed Douglas Downing's fantasy novel setting. I thought this book was in a textbook fashion, not in a way that encourages readers to read and understand the content."
4,Geometry The Easy Way,"This was a used book, so I had no idea what to expect. The book came as advertised, slightly worn, but no markings inside or out. Since I wanted the book for an aide in tutoring my grand daughter, it works out well. I was very satisfied with the book."
1,Not very good,I got this to help with geometry and to be honest it was not very helpful. I wanted something that could go more in depth then my textbook and this said just about the same exact thing as my textbook. If you are just trying to brush up on your math by yourself it may help you but if you are a student looking for some extra help this will not aid you at all.
3,Don't judge a book by it's cover...,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. Not even halfway through the first chapter I was completely confused. If you're like me, you want to know why something is, and how do you explain it in a way that's understandable. I had a horrible time understanding the way in which they explained how to label an angle etc. On a brighter note, I think this would probably be a useful text to use with another source, such as an actual geometry textbook. I also tried Geometry for Dummies which was not very easy to understand either. Maybe Geometry just isn't! :p I finally decided to purchase the ""Geometry Demystified"" which of all three books, seems to be the most informative."
2,"A very dry read, definitely not easy",I don't recommend this book for beginners. First it's the kind of book where you have to read the chapters several times before you 'get it'. The exercises are complicated and confusing. For someone who hasn't picked up a geometry book in decades - look elsewhere.
1,Don't waste your time,"I have always sailed through math courses.I ordered this book to review for my upcoming job teaching HS Geometryat a new school. I couldn't believe this book! Not only is this NOT theeasy way, but it leaves huge holes in guided practice. Where are thenotes about how to properly work out these proofs? There aren't any. Unless you are good at totally figuring this stuff out by yourself, don't buy this book. There are many typos also, which is a big red flag!"
4,Geometry Reference/Refresher,"As a tutor of various subjects, I'm not always fresh in my command of each one, especially if it has been over 20 years since I actively studied it. The Barron's Easy Way series is swiftly becoming a source of choice when I need to refresh myself on a subject. It has been so long since I used Geometry regularly that I easily confuse formulae for area, angle measure, etc., for polygons n=5 or above. It is very helpful to have a ready reference to hone my skills after such a long respite."
4,What the heck?,"Not bad, and if you're a Bill Nelson fan, probably essential, but an eccentric collection of tracks, to say the least; having listened to some of the albums he's drawing from here, I *know* he's got stuff better than a lot of what's on here. The whole package is self-indulgent to the extreme, which is sort of cute in a way: the collection comes with a small booklet containing reproductions of drawing and collages Bill has done (he's a DIY kind of guy). The collages are ok, but the drawings (which are all proudly signed in big letters) are TERRIBLE, the sort of stuff you might see in a high school art class. Don't quit your day job, Bill."
3,Ridiculous Slapstick Humor With Brief Glimpses of Always-Elegant Audrey Hepburn,"I got this because it seems to be the only Audrey Hepburn movie that I haven't seen over the years. She appears from time to time in it, but not enough to save the movie. Audrey Hepburn's son, Sean Ferrer also appears in the movie in a supporting role. Other than that and the fact that Audrey Hepburn is always elegant and delightful to watch, the movie is slow, tortuous, nothing but silly slapstick humor. John Ritter and Ben Gazarra do have their moments, but otherwise it was painful. Awful! Awful! Awful!All the action takes place in a dated NYC with cars and clothes to match.Audrey Hepburn was beautiful, as always. Otherwise, you need to love total nonsense more than I do. Apparently lots of people disagree with me.I'm glad I got it since it was the last feature movie Audrey Hepburn made. She's always brilliant and worth watching."
1,Not very good,"The plot is hard to follow, and doesn't make a lot of sense. And Audrey Hepburn's character is not her average character. I couldn't finish watching it for boredom. Don't waste your time or money."
1,THEY ALL lAUGHED,"I love Audrey Hepburn, but this movie is awful. It shouldn't be this bad with John Ritter and Audrey."
3,Beautiful Women-Thin Story,"Dorothy Stratten and Patty Hansen are stunning in their beauty and the movie is worth seeing just to look at them! There is no plot at all as far as I can tell. Having lived in NYC at that time it was nice to see the benign and fun side of NYC- which was partly true but under-publicized- during an era of rampant crime, NYC's near bankruptcy,riots, blackouts, flight of jobs and the middle class and other depressing events. Still, life went on and nice things happened too,I have never seen a movie that glamorizes smoking cigarettes as does this movie. Every happy, sexy, fun line or action in the movie is paired with lighting, inhaling or sharing a cigarette. I wonder if the tobacco companies had a hand in this and also is any of the many easily influenced teens of that day picked up the habit as a result."
1,What is this movie about?,"I am a bit of a New York City film fan too, and that is the ONLY reason I'm giving this movie a single star.I can't believe I just wasted 2 hours watching this movie.I have NO IDEA what it is even about. Private investigators chasing around people? FOR WHAT REASON? I enjoyed many of the scenes and the views of Brooklyn across the river, seem like another city, compared to what it looks like today. Unless you are into unique New York City movie scenes I would not recommend this movie AT ALL."
2,Falls short,"I have heard a lot about this movie over the years and finally decided to buy it. I am a huge fan of Dorothy Stratten which is the reason why I bought it! I have also heard a lot about Peter Bogdanovich and his movies and style. I am by no means a director so it wouldn't be fair to judge by that, but I know what I like and I didn't like this! It was what I call a ""feel good"" movie where everything fits neatly together(e.g. Coyote Ugly, Varsity Blues) and some parts of the story are left out either deliberately or by mistake so that the whole story comestogether in the end, it was long and had some great talent which were wasted on the storyline which seemed to go in circles. I guess I expected a lot more from a supposedly brilliant Director at the peak of his career!"
5,Finally a beautiful release of this film.,Finally this wonderful film has been released on DVD and the quality of the picture is amazing! It literally looks like it was shot yesterday. This film also includes some extra footage of Dorothy Stratten. The extra footage comes when John Ritter is outside the shoe store and is looking in through the window and observing Dorothy talking with the other girls.This is a fun film and an excellent transfer. Blu-Ray soon?
1,Disappointed,"I bought this because Audrey Hepburn was in it and she is one of my all time favorites, but the movie, itself, does not live up to the hype on the cover. Very disjointed, very ridiculous, and found it very boring. There just didn't seem to be chemistry between the characters and the story, itself, was very weak. I would not recommend this movie even if you are diehard Hepburn fan like myself."
3,Teaching slavery,"I taught US and African-American history for 15 years. Admittedly, junior college and university level. But even in freshman survey courses, NEVER were people in the antebellum North depicted as noble people who abhored slavery. The anti-abolitionist mobs that attacked William Lloyd Garrison, the murder of abolitionist newspaper editor in Alton, Illinois, Northern bigotry regarding African-Americans, was never glossed over. Anyone in the North who recognized the evil of slavery and wanted it ended was seen clearly as an atypical Northerner.Perhaps for the lay reader this book offers revelation. For anyone who's read much about antebellum society, this is not an eye-opening surprise."
2,Unbalanced,"No matter how much of this book is true, it certainly doesn't tell the whole story. The abolition movement in the North was very powerful, especially among certain Christian groups. Thousands of the men in the North who volunteered, and they were all volunteers at the beginnning of the Civil War had the moral purpose of ending slavery in mind. But with modern historical revisionism, all white men are bad, all persons of color are good! I've seen this time and again in current ""histories"" of the period. Certainly you can find racists anywhere you go in this world; the world of today and yesterday. Dwelling on the perceived evils of the past, committed by some, but not all, will not solve the evils of today. Therefore, what is this book worth to our modern society?"
5,excellent experience,This is an excellent book. I originally purchased it for a class but it really turned out to be an excellent read. Very eye-opening.
5,Should be Required Ready,This book needs to be one of the textbooks on the civil war and slavery.Compelling. Riveting. Superbly documented. Great writing.
4,good accurate gun,im her son this is just a good gun accurate too. my friend is a dead on marksman and he loves this gun the scope is worthless but i bought a reel one i like this gun but mine didnt come with a second mag.
2,Flimsy.,"I don't know why people are throwing out five stars for this gun. It practically fell apart in my hands when I first got it. Trust me, spend the extra cash on a Jing Gong."
2,A painful experience,"So I ordered a supply of bountiful breast off of their website. To put it simply I did see minimal growth after 2 months. My breasts were fuller feeling but there were no mind blowing results. I didn't really follow the protein shake regimen regularly (only here and there). I would have continued taking it (because they recommend at least 3 months of it to see visible results) but I could not continue. My ovaries and uterus started killing me, so much so I went to the hospital. It must've been because of the excess of hormones in my body (I was also using a birth control pill at the time). It's too bad too because the pills are so expensive so I ended up blowing a ton of money. I don't think I'm going to buy any enhancement products of any kind anymore..."
5,best weapons movie ever!,this is the best weapons movie I have ever seen..! the skills portrayed in this one are incredible! you'll have to see it to believe it! Sammo hung at his very best! A must see for all action fans!
4,snap pants,we bought these for my elderly father. He liked them but they were a bit slippery so we had to stop using them.
2,Please send my exchange when possible.,"The pants were really nice, but they were too large for my son. I requested an exchange (same style & color) in size medium. To date, I have NOT received the exchange. Could you please look into this for me.Thanks,Bonnie Cutler"
5,This book is fantastic!!,This book is an instant Life Changer. The best part about this book is the CD that comes in the back of it. Louise Hay reads the book to you.So after you read the book she hammers her ideas home to you again and again. Repetition is a must. If everyone on the planet incorporated these affirmations into their lives our world would be 300 years into the future. God Bless Louise Hay for evolving and giving of herself to the rest of us!!!
5,Wonderful CD,"I listened to this CD in my first phase of healing from PTSD. It was soothing, and wonderful. I focussed on the positive. I made myself the positive affirmations.. and I promise you, I believed in them and they worked. I am so amazed. I also liked the Secret DVD, but this book from Louise Hay was more manageable. I didn't use the book as much as the CD. I just put it in my car and passively listened to it. I hope it gives you healing and positive energy!!"
2,Trite and treacly,"I like to start the day with uplifting words and thoughts, so I keep a daily calendar with inspiring quotations or thoughts in the bathroom.While the title of this item, ""I can do it"" promises inspiration, the contents are trite.""I look upon my past, present and future with love"" offers no insight, no inspiration. ""I am dancing on air because life loves me"" is simply an empty thought.Perhaps here are people who find this inspiring. I don't.Jerry"
3,Good book; disappointing cd,The book was very good. I found the cd disppointing because of the advertising comments included.
5,This book is my kaleidoscope of Life,"This book is like my little bible for me: it is my kaleidoscope of Life. Louise Hay deals with 8 essential topics: Health, Forgiveness, Creativity, Prosperity, Job Success, Romantic Relationships, Stress-Free Life, Self-Esteem. At the beginning of each chapter, she gives explanations about each subject and ends the chapter with 20 affirmations. At each affirmation, I give to myself a mark over 10 (1 is minimum, 10 is maximum), so this scale shows me how far I am on the spiritual growth path. When I make a progress from 8 over 10 to 10 over 10, for example, which takes me some weeks or months (it depends on the difficulty of the subject and the speed of my evolution), then I am very glad. When I am able to give to myself 10 over 10 at each and every subject, then I would be able to say that all of my needs are fulfilled."
1,Way too much time spent on the negative???,"I have really appreciated all that Louise Hay's has done throughout the years, but the CD that comes with the book spends way too much time on the negative. I thought it was suppose to be inspiring affirmations. Instead, each track starts out for the first couple of minutes on how bad we are, I can't even listen to the CD. I can see mentioning on the first track that we need to be aware of how many negative thoughts are ruling us then go onto how we can improve those negative thoughts. You are supposed to focus on what you do want so I guess I will have to make my own CD. I still appreciate all Louise Hays has done, this review is just to express my confusion on what I thought I was purchasing, ""positive affirmations""?"
3,Louise Hay,"I am a big fan of Louise Hay and I like her affirmations. I bought this book/cd mostly for the cd. Louise Hay's affirmations are very uplifting and considering what is going on these days, we can use all the help we can get. I like the cd more than the book. The book text and pages are a light color, which is very difficult to read."
1,Love Louise Hay,"I bought it used and the description said it came with a CD, but there was no CD. I would never buy used again"
2,I Can Do It CD,Identical to printed book so it only needs to be listened to once.Not what I expected.
3,"Not a great album, with two exceptions","Chick Corea's ""Spain,"" opening with Frank Tiberi's beautiful bassoon and the flute of Gary Anderson. Then picking up the tempo with a great Dennis Dotson flugelhorn solo towards the end. And John LaBarbera's ""Toothless Grin"" featuring the tenor sax of Gregory Herbert (I played this chart in jazz band).The other ""Pop charts"" weren't as catchy and sort of sappy. This was an one of those albums where Woody followed a musical trend, rather than lead one."
5,A must read for all production managers and supervisors,This quick read with easy and proven strategies will help leaders catapult their people's morale and performance. If you're looking to gain a competitive advantage in 2010 the information in this book is one of the keys. -Dr. Jose I. Garcia contact at jgarciaconsulting.com
3,Motivating Hispanic Employees: A Practical Guide to Understanding and Managing Hispanic Employees,I was some what shocked as to how the Author viewed the Hispanics as employees. His point of view is totally different from my view since I have at least six hispanics working for me
1,not happy :(,"The first time I washed this sheet it looked like a thousand fuzz balls on it. I was afraid to use it, in fear my child would try to pick them off and put them in his mouth."
2,"Short, Mildly Entertaining & Anti-American","I purchased this book in a airport bookstore primarily due to a lack of good books to choose from. This particular book looked like a humorous quick read, which it was. Actually, it read too fast (took me under 1 hour) and took constant jabs at American business and culture. Written by a French author, I wasn't surprised by the blatant anti-Americanism, and I would guess her cynicism towards business culture will be received the wrong way by many readers in France, where this book has already sold 300,000+ copies. In fairness to the author, she did also poke fun at French laziness and their long time high unemployment rate. I think most Americans who read this book would get a good laugh from this humor, but I seriously wonder how many French will take this advice seriously? If you can get your hands on a free copy, it's worth at least reading a chapter or two, but I wouldn't spend any money on it."
5,Songs for Young Women,"This CD is simply beautiful. It is in line with the Mormon publication ""The Strength of Youth"". I just cannot say how much I enjoy it, and love the songs. It is very uplifting."
1,vtech vsmile smartridge batman gotham city rescue,"vtech vsmile smartridge batman gotham city rescueI DID NOT RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT I HAVE TRIED TO INFORM AMAZON AND THE SELLER BUT HAVE GOTTEN NO WHERE THIS IS 2 OF 5 ITEMS PURCHASED I DID NOT RECEIVE I WILL BE VERY LEARY OF DOING BUSINESS ON AMAZON AGAIN, I ALSO DID NOT GET ANY REFUND JUST WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS ONE."
4,gloworm,"Book was what was needed, was used to take a pre-employment test. Covered all the material that was on the test. Also helpful for on the job reference."
1,Disorganized and uninsightful,"The book does not give an adequate survey of Renaissance Art - in fact, it is not about Renaissance Art at all - most of the book is devoted to pre- and early Renaissance art. Only the last chapter covers the High Renaissance and it is the shortest one in the book. Instead it rambles on and on through some key artists and leaves things at that. They do not describe at all what distinguishes a certain city or period fom another - instead they hone in on one or two paintings, yak about it for a while and leave the reader to infer what they mean. The very worst part is that most of the paintings they babble on and on about are not even plated in the book. Extremely diffuse and a grand waste of time and money."
3,it arrived today...so thanks...,It was not like the picture that was shown.I expected to get the book that was shown..the book that I got was a much older version than the picture......a lot of writing and highlighting....
4,Do what's intended,These are very easy to install and do what they are supposed to. I think they are a little overpriced but overall I'm pleased with the quality. For about 95% of installations you can save some $$ and get the 12 in dividers. The 18s work fine but I don't think the extra 6 inches and higher cost buy you much.
5,commentary,"Did the Boston critic fail to find his or her name cited? Perusal would have turned up references to work published in 2000,2001 and 2002. The review was not helpful!"
3,Developmental plasticity and evolution,"Being unfamilar with the jargon of her field, I had difficulty in following her arguments. Exacerbating the problem was scholarly syntax that packed sentences with so many clauses that I had to parce them to locate subjects and verbs.From what I could glean from graphics and summaries, she has made a major contribution to our understanding of the process of evolution. A follow-up book on 'evolution for dummies' should enhance the public's understanding of evolution."
5,New ways of thinking about Biology,"I think that Mary Jane West-Eberhard is trying to formulate a new Shyntesis in Biology, she is trying to include Development in Neo-Darwinism. Her book makes the difference in the role that gives to phenotype, every biologist needs to read it to express his/her own opinions. Really deserves to be read."
2,PACKAGING IS A HASSLE,"Not enough information is given in the product description: it is cumbersome to break off, bend repeatedly, peel off the backing from one (microscopic) corner flap, then push through the foil---all to liberate one chewing piece of gum! Nicorette is available in a much more user-friendly format, akin to other, regular, popular packaged gum brands. I should which type of packagedNicorette I am getting when I order! The gum itself is good. This comment applies to the 2 mg and 4 mg types."
5,"Matsu Takako - Sweet voice, great music","I first discovered Matsu Takako when I was watching a Japanese tv show called ""Love Generation"" also starring very handsome and talented Kimura Takuya. I listened to this Second Wave 2003 concert CD and it is great. Matsu Takako has a very sweet voice. She is very talented also, not only is she a great singer, but she also composed some of the songs that are on this CD. Majority of the songs are slow ballads and the music is very relaxing. She only has like one or two medium temp ones which were fun to listen to. If you have not heard any of her music and want to give her a try, this is a nice CD. But note: this is a live recording of her concert. Some people may not like that live recordings, if you don't like live recordings and want to listen to Matsu Takako, but never heard any of her songs, I recommend her: Five Years Singles, which contains greatest hit singles from the beginning of her 5 years music career."
3,CISSP or CISM?,"I bought this book because there is no other book available (prep guide) that covers the CISM. As I read through the book there is an explicit sentence that reads ""to better prepare you for the CISSP exam""; which test is this preg guide for? If you're going to cut and paste from similar works you've done in the past at least do the readers a favor and use the find/replace all function :). Overall it was a good read and I'll keep it around as a reference."
1,The CISM Prep Guide,"Please do not, under any circumstances spend money on this book. There is actually no real good study material in general for the CISM exam. This book has not been revised since 2003.This is a horrible book for this exam. DO NOT BUY IT. Plain enough?"
1,Outdated Indeed,I'll just echo what others have said before me: in 2008 this book is so outdated that it's no longer useful for the CISM exam. Spend your money on the ISACA guides instead.
1,You can do better,"The product details are the first giveaway - 456 Pages?My book finishes at page 433. Anything of substance in the bookfinishes where appendix A starts at Page 259. In other words there is a lot less to the book than the stated 456 pages. The CISM is considered to be a rival to the CISSP by some, and Krutz & Vines made a decent job with the CISSP Prep Guide (Gold edition). What happened here ?The Boson questions are woeful with numerous mistakes. I gave feedback to the publishers and was informed that ""The publisher and author have acknowledged that this is an error created by the question writer hired to write the questions for the CD test"" Were Mr Krutz and Vines too busy to even QA the questions, let alone write them?"
2,CISM Exam far different,"It must be difficult to write an exam review book before the exam is actually offered. I purchased this book for additional reference before taking the CISM Exam over the past weekend; 6/03. This was the first time the exam has been offered to the public. I estimate that 80% of the exam questions where not covered in this book. While the material presented by the author's is valid, it did not help much in terms of the exam. This book is much more useful for someone trying to obtain the CISSP not CISM."
1,"Deceiving!, not OEM as claimed.","I ordered Aprilaire 201 filter (two in 1 box) from Amazon. When arrived, the box does not look like what was shown on Amazon website at all. Once I opened it, the filter has no printed label on its rim at all. The OEM one did have the Aprilaire logo and model #. I know that because I ordered and received from Amazon last year the OEM product, and the very filter was in the filter box when I was doing the replacing today. This is deceiving. I read the review very carefully and was convinced I will get the authentic OEM product. I know Amazon can not police every vendor that carefully. I hope through this review, Amazon would kick these dishonest bad apples out."
3,Did not receive Aprilaire filter,The brand of the one I received was AmericanAirFilter. In the item description on Amazon it says 'by Aprilaire' - but that isn't what I got. After order the picture in 'Your Orders' shows a Aprilaire filter. One I received doesn't match the picture at all. Way too expensive for a OEM knockoff. Will try to return.1/7/13 - company sent me a return label so I could send back the incorrect one and then sent me the correct Aprilaire filter. Won't be using it for a while since I had to purchase one locally since I initially received the wrong one. I assume it will be just fine.
4,As promised...,"What can you say? It's air filter media. It was packaged well, arrived as promised and fit. It was pretty easy to install. I would likely reorder this same one when we need one next year."
5,Furnace filter,"I bought one earlier to make sure it was the correct filter and was easy to install. I have 2 furnaces, so I ordered another and 2 more to keep on hand."
5,Nice Aprilaire filter,"I am very pleased with the Aprilaire Space-Gard 201 Replacement Filter. I suffer from many airborne allergies and this filter has helped me avoid the use of an inhaler for a few seasons. In San Antonio, TX the pollen is year round, unfortunately, it means I cannot open my house to the breeze but living in filtered air is so much better for me.This filter is very easy to install. It lasts as long as I would expect, and it works like I expected. This is my 2nd purchase of this filter through Amazon.Amazon shipped it in a timely manner and I am pleased."
5,Filter works fine,"Had an Aprilaire installed in 2008. When they told me the price to have them ""maintain"" the unit I checked into doing it myself. There is a YouTube video for replacing these filters that you will definitely want to watch. Search a couple and watch 2 or 3 to get the idea. About a 5 minute job and fairly safe it you aren't seriously ham-handed. Don't know if the other filters are just as good but for the extra couple of bucks I'd just as soon buy this one. Installed with no problems whatsoever so I'm a happy camper."
4,Be patience,The replacement filter works great! It's just a little tricky to install. If you use a little patience you can get it done in 10 15 minutes.
4,As advertised,The filter arrived promptly and was as advertised. It was an exact replacement and easy to install. The only reason I did not award 5 stars was that the price was a little high for what the product is. In the future I will monitor the price and order multiple filters when I find the best price instead of waiting until it must be changed.
5,All 3 kids LOVED these books!,"I am the great auntie to a 4, 5, and 7 year old. From pre-school to 1st grade, all three kids LOVE these books! They come home and during reading time with their mom or dad each one makes sure they get their turn! I love to call and have them ""read a book to me"" over the phone and they love doing it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this set of five books to every parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, cousin, friend.... Well worth buying new if you can't find used. These spoiled little darlings have about 200 children's books (ok, so I bought most of them), and these are everyone's #1 favorite!!! The 5-year old had a ""weak reading skills"" report card, and he was the first one tonight to haul out these books and force his mom to start reading time---WOW---need I say more?"
5,Most important book I ever read about AH,AH was not the incarnation of evil nor was he a force of nature. He was a very common man who was as much a sponge and a mirror of his world as he was an actor upon it. If anything he was a clown which is what made him laughable out of power and deadly once he achieved it. Steiner understands ALL of this and his morality tale gives an insight into the nature of our nature. It is as much a lamentation as it is an argument but either way it is an enlightenment.
5,"Nazism - theory, causality, failure","This book describes the causality of Nazism (cultural), the theory, and why it failed."
4,I agree with most of the other reviewers,"This album is a lot like IG's earlier work, and it definitely lacks the edge of Come On Now Social, one of my favorite albums. That said, it does grow on you. Had I written this review after my first few listenings, it might have been far more negative. But now that I know the words to most of the songs and can sing along (one of my favorite things about IG is that they sing in my range), I've come to like a few of the songs very well, like Hope Alone and Become You. Looking forward to seeing the Girls in concert next week..."
3,Return to pre-Shaming of the Sun form,"Become You is a treat for fans of early Indigo Girls, as it is definitely a return to the acosutic form of their earlier work. The album has a very ""Nomads, Indians, Saints"" feel to it. Not at all a bad thing, but if you're expecting this album to be as rocking as ""Come On Now Social"", then you won't get what you expect.Looks like Amy Ray got the electric-rock bug out of her system with ""Stag"". Nothing on Become You is as heavy as ""Hey Castrator"" or ""LucyStoners"".Again, that doesn't make this album bad, but as a fan of the later IG catalog, I don't place Become You among my favorite albums. It has some high points, though. Emily's ""You've Got To Show"" has some great harmonization, and some comfortable vocal releases not heard since ""Watershed"" and ""Mystery"". And Amy's ""Bitterroot"", the most interesting, and probably best track on the album, is worth the price of the CD all by itself."
4,Rocks,"This album is one of my favorite girls albums. I love the fast shuffles they use. And the sequenced of fast, slow, fast, slow is nice."
5,Saving Me should be a Single !!,I love the older indigo girls music - this is right up my alley. More acoustic sound and the lyrics speak - not scream to me. I am so glad I got the additional cd because that version of Saving Me is awesome !! I will have this in my cd player for a long time. I picture myself slowly kayaking down a small river to the music - so peaceful and thought provoking. I am so glad Amy and Emily are still making such good music. I hope very much to see them live in the near future. This one is a keeper !!
2,"Too close to ""easy listening""","This CD is somewhat of a disappointment after themore eclectic Come On Now Social. Gone is Amy'sedgier guitar work, and gone is Emily's foray intocountry-pop. What's left is mostly easy listeningpunctuated by a few tracks from Amy Ray that keep theCD somewhat listenable without putting you to sleep.I wouldn't say this CD is a return to form -- it doesn'thave the spirit of the earlier releases. Does anyoneremember ""Kid Fears""? Now there was spirit. This CD,a few tracks aside (Moment of Forgiveness, Become You,Bitterroot), is just mushy."
5,If it ain't broke don't fix it,"WELL IT'S ABOUT TIME my wonderful ladies gave us what we've been wanting. My, my. That Emily can sing right to my heart. She sings with such vulnerability and both of these ladies have this marvelous gift of writing and singing about social issues in a cool, hip, yet still meaningful way. They give words to my feelings on everything from racisim, mother earth, immigration, and of course, relationships. Here's the deal, if you liked the songs Ghost, Joking, and Virginia Wolf (i.e. their early stuff), you'll love this. I have not bought an album from them in so long because I couldn't stand this odd, Amy dominated, musical tangent they were on. I'm so glad their musical journey has brought them full-circle, and not because they really needed an album they knew would sell (I'm horrible, I know) Now-it seems things are back in Amy/Emily balance. Ahhhh, sweet bliss!!!"
4,Indigo Girls Do Not Disappoint,"This is an older CD but one I didn't have. If you like the Indigos, you'll enjoy this nice balance of mellow harmonies and folk rock."
2,Girls become average,"Being a longtime devotee to Indigo Girls, I was quite excited when I read the reviews that said this album is a throwback to their early days. I bought it expecting folk-rock at its finest. I must say, I'm disappointed.Not only does this album not live up to classic IG such as ""Nomads*Indians*Saints"" and ""Rites of Passage,"" it doesn't live up to a lot of other similar artists' offerings (Dar Williams, Ani Difranco). Sure, there are a few songs that have the glimmer of the old IG magic, such as ""Become You"" and ""Starkville"". Most of the rest though blend together in overly-sappy pop ballads - with the exception of ""Bitter Root,"" which just seems woefully out of place.Maybe I'm an IG purist. Maybe I'm a snob. Maybe I'm like the REM fans that think anything after ""Green"" or ""Out of Time"" just doesn't live up. I don't know. Regardless, ""Become You"" just didn't do it for me."
4,Amy's best effort yet!,"This whole album is good, but Amy's at the top of her game and her songs are great! I often find myself skipping ahead to her songs - something I used to do with Emily's songs on previous albums."
4,Really good tunes,"I've been a fan for over 10 years-back from their days in Athens, GA at the Uptown Lounge. My favorite stuff is the old stuff-the raw sound of Strange Fire. While Become You rings of that old soulful sound, it's polished and mature. They've come a long way baby!"
4,A laid back album,"I immediately fell in love with the new Album, Become You, as soon as I heard it. My favorite songs on the album are Deconstruction, Moment of Forgiveness, You've Got To Show, and She's Saving Me. I highly recommend purchasing the album from Amazon since you get the bonus disc which includes 3 songs, two of which are acoustic.I didn't think the album was that acoustic. It was a little over produced than what I was expecting. The vocal arrangements were a little simple for the girls. Sure they harmonized well, but If you compare the vocals from past albums, you kind of expect harmonies and arrangements which are intense and intricate like Virginia Woolf, Wood Song, or Ghost. I think a lot of Indigo fans deep down, hope that they will come out with another ""Closer to Fine"" album.Basically, it was a laid back album."
2,"Great idea, but not too flavorful and unfriendly to teeth","I wanted to like these crackers, given the awesome nutritional profile and ingredients. I would say two and a half stars, and it's because the idea is great but the execution is not so good. I'm just unhappy that I'm stuck with five more bags of these things.There are two primary weaknesses:1) Lack of flavor. I think I need to try the other cracker flavors, because these are just whole flaxseeds with some Bragg Liquid Aminos (soy sauce, basically) and lemon juice, and the flavor is just not enough for me.2) Awful chewing experience. When you eat one of these, the flaxseeds stick. Everywhere. Between your teeth. On the roof of your mouth. Lodged around your jaw. Really, it takes a long time to feel like you don't have flax embedded everywhere in your mouth. Not a very social snack, for this reason.I hope they keep working on this, as the idea is good."
1,Don't taste good,"These crackers serve the purpose of getting flax down, with what that does, but they do not taste good, to me. I'm going to try some other brands and not get these any more."
2,Could have been tastier and less slimy.,"Just got these crackers because of the positive reviews. I guess the saying ""to each his own"" is a truism because these crackers are pretty bad. One could not eat them unless one was super starved. Not oly don't they taste good but they are of slimy consistency. Would never buy them again but I have to give the company some kuddos for their effort to come up with gluten free products."
2,Golden Flax Crackers,"The product arrived when expected, but I was not crazy about the flavor and texture. I have used flaxseed in baking, but this was the first time I tasted it alone. If you like the taste of flaxseed, then these crackers will probably work for you."
1,Empty,"The first chapter or two could have made an interesting magazine article. The book as a whole is otherwise empty of any useful content.The author wishes to impress us that he has heard of every computer term, and continually trots these out in no particular order and mostly not in context.His message boils down to:- AI has some uses today, and the AI/Expert System vendors are worth looking to for a programming tool to address today's programming needs. There you are, there is no need for you to read the book now!"
4,Not Bad!,"PROS:Easy installation on my car (Toyota Corolla 2008)Increases visibility at night and also in extreme conditionsBulbs (H3) can be changed to more powerful bulbsGive a new look to the carCONS:Can be dificult to install electrical wiring ...Bulbs which are provided are not very bright, only 55W ...."
4,The boy is from New Jersey,"This film is a story based on the bronze statues of three soldiers depicted in the Viet Nam Memorial, in Washington D.C. Three marines are trapped behind enemy lines in a war-torn VietNam and must journey through occupied territory in a school bus to reach an American safety unit miles away. It's a ride through Hell in a country without Law and justice. The acting is very good and the film has quality for it's small budget, and good FX. Daniel Stephen who always performs his own stunts was great. More realistic then Chuck Norris and Rambo. ..."
5,Bright and Colorful,"My daughter loves these! I put them above her changing table and she just stares the whole time! Which makes it alot easier to change and dress her. The eyeore plays music, its not long, only about 10 seconds. The best way to hang these is with double sided taped. I put 2 strips on each animal and they arent going anywhere. Good buy at 9.99!"
4,Very Cute,I got this for my son and put it near the crib where he could push on eyore to hear the music. Very cute and a great addition to any nursery.
3,Later works are much better,"This novel is impressive for a early effort in the author's career. There are some early, illogical developements in the protagonist's not understanding what is happening. This is a plot device, which prompts the reader to question the character's acuity, and judgement; designed to increase the tension.I would recommend this book to someone, but with reservations."
1,Boring Book,"This was just a very boring story. On top of that the author was the reader on the tape and he is just monotone. No change of inflextion, pitch or anything to make it more pleasurable to listen to. I thought it was too full of details about numbers and lacked a lot for a mystery."
3,A Different Tony Hillerman Experience,"I really like Tony Hillerman's novels though this is one is very different than any of his others. The protagonist is believably dull but is fleshed out nicely to make the action move really well. Many of the other characters, the girl friend, for instance, always remains a 2 dimensional spacer in the overall plot movement. I would rate this book a 4 star on the same level as Finding Moon, but not on a par with Chee and Leaphorn.This book is still a good choice today compared to the current level of fiction that is being generated today by method writers."
2,Not one of his best,"I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me."
5,Great Book,This is a great book on advanced BGP design and implementation. As another reviewer mentioned this is not an introductory text to BGP so make sure you read through Internet Routing Architectures or the BGP section of Routing TCP/IP vol. 2 prior to this book.
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I'm thinking about adding a pond feature to my property and purchased this DVD to give me ideas. Basically it's little more than a ""Laguna"" pond products DVD. Yes, it covers the very simplest of basics but really doesn't provide enough information to build a good pond much less a ""perfect"" pond. It did include a calculation for determining a pond liner size but it didn't explain how to calculate/determine pump size, filter size or type. They essentially discussed their products with a few very basic pond ideas and that was about it. Nothing they discussed creates the ""Perfect Pond"". A couple pond magazines would provide far more information.Don't waste your money."
2,Great until it ripped,"Initially I liked the softness of this sheet. It fit my standard sized mattress well and didn't seem to shrink at all. After about 10 washings, however, the sheet was visibly thinner. When I was removing it from the mattress for washing, it ripped up the side. I did give it a gentle tug, but no stronger than usual and none of my other sheets have ripped. Disappointing since otherwise I had been pleased with this product."
3,Extremely hard to put on,"This is a nice winter sheet,it is soft and I like how well it fits, it's impossible for baby to get tangled up in it.I literally have to wrestle with the sheet and mattress just to get the darn thing on!Hopefully this one won't shrink because I don't think I'll buy another one!"
1,not the article,"Ten bucks and nowhere does it say that this is just the abstract, not the full article. A complete rip-off as the title pretty much gives away the substance of the abstract. No meat here."
3,Debated praise.,"While this is not my favorite Henry Cow, Mr. Spear is not alone in calling it his favorite. The rhythyms appear to me to be more ""avant guard"" and fractured than their other albums. The two ""sides"" of the album are composed by T. Hodgkinson and L. Cooper. My favorite Henry Cow composers are Fred Frith and John Greaves. While Cooper has gone on and composed some quite nice material, for example ""News from Babel""; sometimes I think of ""Each in Our Own Thoughts"" in association with Hodgkinson- ack, erg... whew. There are some good parts to this cd, and clearly some people love it. Buy it. Maybe you'll love it."
1,Yuck,"This album is stupid. The people who made this album are stupid. Everyone who likes this album is stupid. I wish I could give it no stars, because it is SO stupid."
3,Wonderful Cow CD but GET REMASTERED,"This is the last official Henry Cow album from the 1970's. It is a good record, but the ESD 1995 pressing in very tinny. No real bottom tones come through and while bass in not primarily featured on the original recording, the remaster is much better sounding with a good frequency range, including the bottom tonalities. ESD had a remaster (1999) and now ReR (which is the bands back catelog new home) has one coming out in June 2005.Get it. Excellent Spin!"
2,hermeneutically challenged,"This Bible Study was disappointing in its selection of verses for the topic. Some obvious passages that should have been used were not and some obscure passages were selected and my Bible Study felt the verses were not interpreted correctly, especially the selection on Daniel. I would not recommend this one, but other Life Guide studies I've enjoyed like the one on David."
4,Valuable introduction to the labyrinth mysteries and powers.,"This book is probably the best way to start with the study of the multiple significations and applications of this ancient labyrinth science. Full of very good references, and stangely enlightened insights. Two flaws however: often stays at the surface of an idea, sometimes gets a little carried away. That's why it's more of an introduction than a true reference book. My advice: read this book and then go to Grace Cathedral in San Fransisco walk the labyrinth."
2,Looks great,"I had bought this weathertech deflector that said it was the right one for my car. When I got it it didn't fit the contours of the roof. I emailed the manufacturer but no response. I sent it back to Amazon, of course they gave me my full refund back. I've heard other's say that they had no problems with theirs but for me I went with another brand that fits great!"
1,precursor of de Sade,"I decided to read this after noting Henry Miller's enthusiasm for the book in The Tropic of Cancer (I figured if Miller liked it, it must be good). I was sorely disappointed. I have nothing against bawdy or scatological humor on principle, but I found Rabelais simply boring, tasteless, and completely bereft of genuine humor. This is the sort of thing that gets guffaws from 12-year old boys who think that simply using foul language makes them endlessly witty. If you want early novelists with a tendency toward the bawdy and/or scatological, I recommend Boccaccio, Cervantes and Sterne. And if you absolutely, positively must wallow in a cesspool of disgusting smut, go to the master - the Marquis de Sade."
5,Cleans the air,"This unit is absolutely silent is makes no noise and it gets all the dander from our animals out of the air!! It is the best one we have ever used, this is our second one because we wanted one in our daughters room."
4,It works,"I like that i can clean the rods with a damp cloth and do not have to buy extra filters. I have asthma and must have one in each room i spend time in es[pecially the bedroom, living room and den."
1,No good,"Not impressed with the book at all. I am a recent widow and needed help. Not there, in my opinion."
3,It serves its purpose.,This books serves its purpose for those who are still looking to be married and have not came to a place of being single and satisfied in their lives.
5,Wow what a great bar!,The bars are excellent and were recieved in a very timely manner. Fantastic product!
2,take your cheap selenium and eggs,". although much of this research is out-dated,the one advice they gave that still stands is:. if you do nothing else,take a cheap selenium supplement[11.6: (but use selenate not selenite)]and don't be afraid of egg yolks .. later they commented in an interviewthat the most out-dated thing about the bookwas its heavy reliance on anti-oxidant theory,whereas glycemic load plays a much greater role in current research ."
4,A must read for health enthusiasts,"I consider Life Extension the ""bible"" of health books. A lot of practical and scientific work has gone into this must have book. With this book and ""How to tell what health foods to buy"", you pretty much cover what you need to stay healthy and live longer!"
2,Twenty-plus years reveal their charlatanry,"This book has become more of a historical curiosity than a relevant guide to improving one's health. Although Durk and Sandy tried to do a morally defensible thing, their efforts to intervene into their aging processes via concentrated man-made chemicals don't seem to have succeeded. If you search for recent photos of them on the Web, you'll notice that these days they look like hell."
4,27 Years of Experience Using this book,"I have been using the advice in this book for the past 27 years. I started the regimen when I was 24 years old. I have rarely been ill and when I have been ill, it didn't last very long. People rarely can guess my age, they usually think that I am in my mid-30's. I am also post menopausal and have been taking at least 2,000 mg of time-released vitiman C per day and I've not suffered any ill effects. I do advise caution when approaching any regimen until you figure out what works best for you."
4,must read for better health,"I read this book a long time ago and I have found it to be way ahead of its time the issues discussed then scientist are now just coming out with information that affects our body that, durk and sandy talked about years ago. if any one wants to get a copy of the book check out life extension foundation.com"
1,Poor transfer,"ONE STAR is for the poor transfer. Take my word for it - buying this so called ""remastered"" classic film is a waste of money. I opted for this more expensive edition thinking I'd get a decent print. Instead, it was of such poor quality - constantly breaking up, and at time completely stopping, I gave up watching. An old copy I have from TV is far superior.Amazon should be ashamed they listed this item for sale.Go for the cheaper version - I doubt it could be worse."
2,Beat the Devil,"The quality of this dvd is marginal. The voices and lips don't match up for the first part of the movie which is very annoying but then they come together. There are several times when the dvd stopped but would resume on it's own. I know it's an old movie but if I paid more than $5.00 for it (which I did), it was too much."
1,Incredibly Disappionting,I don't know what they consinder remastering but the image quality is very poor. Not only that but the disk began skipping half way through the film and never stopped. I would consider the other version.
5,Impressive Collection of New Compositions,"""Freedom to Love"" represents Real Music's tribute to the victims of September 11th. It is a moving, soothing and quite beautiful CD with ten original compositions from such musicians as 2002, Kevin Kern, Danny Wright and newcomer David London. In addition, there are three specially selected pieces from the likes of Patrick O'Hearn and Jim Chappell.As with all Real Music collections, this one transports the listener into another world. Personal favourites are tracks 1 (""One"" by Russel Walder, from an upcoming release on the Real Music label), 2 (""Fields of Hope"" by Element"") and 12 (""We are One"" by Hiko).The packaging is attractive and, at just over 61 minutes in length, represents good value for money.A fitting tribute to the victims of that awful day."
5,Chemical Engineering Volume 3 3rd ED,This is a great reference text for examples and plausible result calculations. It is a great addition to your technical library.
5,"Very flexible, great feature set","This firewall has an excellent set of features and pretty powerful hardware for the price. I have been testing it on firmware v4.00 for about 3 weeks now. Its logging and alerting settings are some of the best I've seen. Our 3des VPN tunnels to a high-end Cisco PIX have been very stable. ICSA certification is a plus and documentation is pretty solid.I tested or researched many models from Netgear, Linksys, Cisco, Sonicwall, and Symantec before finding this unit that did everything I needed. Support (phone or email) actually gets you to someone knowledgeable. I think this unit is a great choice for small LAN/WANs up to 100 users or so."
2,What happened to South America?,How can a book about great birding spots not have a single mention of South America?
4,"Good picture, buttons hard to read","I bought this monitor to replace a Dell monitor that died. The price is good and the image is clear (probably better than the Dell it replaced). My only complaint is that the brightness, contrast, etc. buttons are small with black on black images, and they're hard to read. This is not a giant problem, since I set them once and haven't needed them since."
1,Review of SyncMaster 720n,"This is the worst monitor you can buy. I made the mistake of buying one about 6 months ago and its already quitting on me, for example the Brightness is always all the way up and when i turn it down it goes back up. In addition to this the resolution absolutely sucks!!! and the monitor it self is blurry and not clear. My advise to you it don't buy it, there is a lot better monitors out there for a better or equal price."
1,Horrible,"I chose a Samsung LCD monitor because my Samsung picture tube monitor looked great. I was in for a shock, though. The picture on the LCD was so horrible, it was basically unusable. Adjusting the settings did not help. Black and white images had an obvious pink tint to them. The screen also had uneven brightness at different viewing angles. Colors shift depending upon your seating position. Yellows used to highlight database selections could not even be displayed! They showed up as white, like the background. (They show up fine on my picture tube monitor.) I returned the LCD monitor immediately for a refund. I would have given it 0 stars if I could.I also returned a Sony LCD monitor for nearly identical problems.Bring back the picture tube (CRT). CRT monitors look much better than LCDs."
1,A book that belongs only in a Army Tactical Command library.,"This tome should be credited to General Fred Franks with commentary by Tom Clancy. I found it difficult to distinguish who wrote what. And a credit it is to Fred Franks for a brilliant career of personal perserverance and an outstanding performance of service to his country. But to an average reader of history, the book would have benifitted form a glossary of military abbreviations. Frankly, I got lost and eventually gave up trying to keep up. It was written by a military man for the military. As the subtitle states ""A Study in Command"". I'll think twice before spending money on a book with Mr. Clancy's name in the future."
2,Poorly written for such an important topic,"The book is very dense and poorly written. I expected a clearer narrative from Clancy. The book is repetitive and could be much tighter. Franks complains about being criticized for the tempo of his forces during the war. While he may have been wrongly criticized, it seems to be eating him up and the book reads like a 700 page justification of his decisions. I think it really detracts from what could have been an expert level description of the ground war. I appreciate that Franks is describing the war from his perspective, but I would have preferred less of his emotions and more matter of fact information about how the war progressed and the battles fought. He uses much more ink describing how the criticism of him was incorrect than he does describing his corps elimination of the Iraqi divisions."
4,A good tool for studying leadership.,"Anyone who has undertaken the task of becomming a leader in the military has struggled with the same decisions Gen. Franks does in this book. The kicker is that the General is doing this in a combat situation, not in training as new leaders mostly do.This book is a good read for any leader. Especially if one's unit is Armor, Armored Cav, or a supporter of this type of unit."
2,Boring,"This book is interesting at points. The chapters regarding General Franks experiences in Viet Nam and his recovery from his wounds are very interesting. However, the book really drags, especially in the middle 250 pages. Unless you are extremely interested in the history of the army's doctrine, I would recommend skipping ahead to the end of the book. (...)"
5,Excellent Listening,"I enjoyed reading the book so I was skeptical that the audio would be as good. It was. Simon and Schuster have done a great job abridging the book onto tape. The audio is crisp and clear. Boyd Gaines and Ken Jenkins do a terrific job as the voice characterizations for the book. I felt as if I were listening to General Franks himself. ""Into the Storm"" is General Franks' personal story of his life from Viet Nam to the victory in the Gulf War. Great listening, well worth the price. 5 hours."
2,The title doesn't cover the story.,"Unfortunately, although I am sure Tom Clancy and Franks do try to give a spectator's view on the Gulf War too much time is spent on other aspects like Franks' military career which are interesting but are too elaborate."
3,Audio is the only way to go!,"After listening to the last two Clancy novels on tape, I checked out his INTO THE STORM from the local library. I'm glad I did! Whittled done to what really matters, this book about the VII Corps actions in the Gulf War through the eyes of its commander, General Fred Franks, is an inciteful look at the modern U.S. Army. I was most interested in Frank's comments about his misunderstandings with General Schwartzkopf. With all of our advancements in communications, it's baffling to see how leaders and subordinates still mess up the chain of command!"
1,Dull,"Some authors have the knack of writing non-fiction and creating a vibrant, readable narrative. In this category, Winston Churchill, Bruce Catton and Shelby Foote come to mind immediately. Tom Clancy's fiction is good but I found this latest of his books mired in trivia and dull, dull, dull"
4,General Franks on leadership,Good read. Also gave me a better understanding of Desert Storm and made a talk by Genereal Franks more enjoyable.
2,A tough technical slog for civilians,"Clancy does a superb job of researching the techo wiz factors for his excellent works of fiction. Then he trys to turn the research notes into books. For the military uninitiated they can be a tough read. INTO THE STORM is the rebuttal to the Schwartzkof book ""It doesn't Take a Hero""(?) Far too technical. I was looking foward to Clancys treatise on Desert Storm in his usual style but was very disappointed with this Military Manual."
1,A book for historians and researchers,"This is quite simply the worst book I have ever finished. I must admit, that in places, I skimmed over the text.If you have ever been forced to listen to someone recount their golf round shot by excruciating shot, you know what it is like to read this book. It is virtually impossible to follow the troop movements without intense concentration or constant referral to the few maps included. Dry as dust.Like me, many Clancy fans will be suckered into purchasing this book on his name alone. This will be a mistake. I found no Clancy here. This book is an obvious response by General Franks (who I am sure is a fine man and an excellent soldier) to criticism levelled by General Schwartzkopf in his book on the Gulf War.If you are researching Desert Storm, this book may be helpful; otherwise, avoid this book at all costs!"
4,Best radio/pop/dance song of 2003 and Blondie's best single,"Got my copy in the mail yesterday and been listening to it over and over. The Scissor Sisters remix is the best of the remixes for sure and the Giorgio Morodor mix is decent, although I find myself listening to the original single version the most actually. The only thing that keeps this CD from being 5 stars is the Dead Guys Ghost mix which I think is too far from the original song and way overdone to the point where the song is barely recognizable. Can't wait for the album to come out and I hope this song gets US airplay soon because once it does it'll take off like gangbusters. This song is to 2003 what ""Heart of Glass"" was to 1978/79 but even better."
2,Great concept but not made for sharp puppy teeth,"I was looking for a toy that would challenge and keep the attention of my puppy and this seemed like a great find. He loved the squeakers and the crinkle paper inside the bone and the rings but it didn't take long for his sharp little teeth to rip holes in the bone and in the rings. Also, the rings were so hard to remove from the bone that he never quite got the hang of pulling them off, at least not on purpose. Perhaps the Intellibone would be better for an older dog that isn't an aggressive chewer."
3,Meh....,My four month old miniature schanzuer didn't really seems to get the idea of pulling off the rings. He would chew them if i took them off of the bone and chew them if they were on the bone.. but has not worked how to get them off. So its a nice toy but does not do what I had hoped.
4,Outstanding!,"Rosa Passos is in top form again,what a wonderful Cd,she has the most beautiful voice,Gal Costa remains my favourite Brazilian singer but Rosa is closing fast"
5,Excelente,"Una nueva voz para mi, que a los acordes de Vossa Nova es fenomenal. Me encanta y lo recomiendo a los que les guste esta musica."
5,ROSA!!!! ROSA!!!! ROSA!!!!,"ROSA!!!ROSA!!!ROSA!!!...I DARE anyone to listen to Rosa on a bright sunny day, without a smile!!!! I DARE anyone to play this CD while sipping a little cool Sangria and not feel passionate!!!! I DARE anyone to dismiss this marvelous, album...this wonderful... S'WONDERFUL, (Gershwin's classic and only English composition herein)...Really!!! You will be overwhelmed with emotion...and swept away by the hypnotic groove of the rhythm of Rosa's soft, subtle, caressing voice!!! YES!!!...YES!!!...YES!!!... You can't help falling in LOVE with Rosa on this sublime recording.... Trust Me!!!....Buy It!!!....You'll LOVE It!!!...Afterall, the name of the album is AMOROSA!!!...Any other silly questions!!!!"
1,Poor quality brushes produce poor quality paint job,"The bristles on these brushes are way too flimsy. They don't hold paint well, they don't allow paint to flow. Do not waste your money. You'd have better luck painting with cooked spaghetti."
1,A looser.,I bought this assigned text - and never used it.. It was hard to follow and not well-written. It is sitting on my bookshelf waiting to be resold to the next user.
2,This is not your father's Lava(tm) Lamp.,"First of all I don't know if this is officially licensed from the company that makes lava lamps, but it is not the same kind of thing. It's not a dual colored liquid goop machine like a lava lamp. It's a bunch of glitter in a colored liquid. And it doesn't keep moving either. After a few hours you'll need to shake it a bit to get things moving again. It's kind of cool for a little while, but if you're hoping to relive some old memories you'd be better off with the real thing and a little incense."
5,Perfect.,"This is one of the best bible story books my family has discovered. My 6 y.o. son begs us to read it to him at night and we can't stop at just one story. Story length is perfect, just enough to expose him and keep his interest, and not too long. Great exposure and sets him up for good bible foundation. Recently bought it and already at the new testament."
1,Excellent book,I purchased this book for my kids and they love it! They now know many bible stories as this book is easy to read and understand.
4,Judaism reinterpreted for the modern age,"Fromm, a radical humanist (and a nonbeliever in God) still writes in the great Jewish tradition of optimism and of belief in human potential. Fromm had an excellent traditional Jewish upbringing, and although more traditional thinkers will disagree with his conclusions, they are at least well grounded in Old Testament texts.The book is a bit dated in that one of its intellectual underpinnings is the belief that human beings can perfect themselves through self-understanding, specifically through psychoanalysis. The twenty-first century has not been charitable to that conclusion."
4,Wii external fan,This fan is great. Just stick it on the back of your Wii system and it keeps it cool.
3,Useful...,"The music is good, but the voices on this tape don't always seem to fit the part, and they sometimes concentrate so much on elocution (as opposed to singing) that it is somewhat distracting. The tempos also vary considerably from the movie version. That said, my wife used it to practice ""Climb Every Mountain"" for a community theatre SOM production (she played Mother Abbess) and it helped her considerably! Practice with the (almost painfully) slow tempo helped her develop better breath control that helped make the (normal tempo) live performance spectacular!"
2,newer version is better,The tracks on this cd are old. Newer karaoke cds tend to have better sound. The guide vocals are terrible. I would buy the newer Stage Stars accompaniment version instead if you don't need the on-screen lyrics.
4,great product,allways a great opption for my customers at a good price and a great fit for all the cars we have boughtthanks and would recomend to every one
4,girls from the big forest,"Värttinä first became popular in our country in the 80's as part of the new folk movement and quickly established themselves as spokesgirls for roots music. this album captures their in their prime. Outstanding tracks are ""Kylä vuotti uutta kuuta"" (The village was waitin for the new moon"") and ""Ukko lumi"" (Snow man). These girls had a way of putting you under their spell - maybe it was the Eastern-Karelian mysticism that's so hard to resist for a Finnish audience. As a time piece this album is essential - a reminder to us Finns that Värttinä could really touch our hearts and make us cry (and a moment later laugh through the tears)."
5,A taste of the Valhalla!,"I love Varttina, I love the vocals.Having said that I would say this group is one of the reasons why I started studying Finnish (after all, I wanted to understand what was sung :).""Kyla vuotti uutta kuuta"" is the best traditional song I have ever heard. The strength with which Varttina vocalists sing this song is touching. If you close your eyes, you can almost see valkyries taking you from the ground and sending you to paradise.The first time I heard this song I thought to myself: ""This is the song I want someone to sing for me in my funeral and send me strait to paradise!""The live presentation has its pros and cons but the overall result is really impressive. I would love to have the tape or better a DVD of this show in Helsinki."
2,B Movie.,"Not a very well written movie. although the storyline is plausable, the details seem thrown together as filler. A Good looking couple though (initially)."
1,Hideous,"Only a movie for those that are gluttons for punishment. It starts out bad, gets worse, and then gets painfully bad. The only reason I got through it was because I was playing Batman: Arkham City at the same time."
2,The shirt was fine,"The helmet came all smashed and i had to stuff a bunch of t-shirts in it for a week to fill it out. Everything was flimsy. The shoulder's were completely off shaped and never stayed on the shoulders. The chest, well, it was as bad as the shoulders. I ended up just wearing the shirt and belt and left the chest and shoulders off. Luckily i decided to go as a vampire knight so i left that flimsy helmet off as well as it wouldn't have really matched just the shirt anyways."
2,If only there were more bullets flying in this film,"Charles Bronson has done a remake of The Gauntlet here in Love and Bullets. Same old storyline tough cop exidrites a female prisoner brings her back so she can testify against the mob. But the Gauntlet was more satifying than this. I am sorry to say that because i'm a big fan of Charles Bronson, but i'm afraid ol charlie missed the mark here quite a bit. The only thing remarkable in this film is the breathtaking swiss alps scenery. And as for Rod Steiger has got to be the most pathetic villain in film history, a stutering mafiso in love with his mistress. Even the greats like Charles Bronson can make bad chocies at times and appearing in this terrible,boring film is one of those times."
2,"Good scenic photography, but that's about it.","Bland thriller in which Charles Bronson must deliver gangster's moll Jill Ireland to police while assassins trail them all the way by boat, train and plane. There's little suspense in Wendell Mayes' script (he also wrote DEATH WISH 1) but attractive scenic photography makes up for the movies lulls. This lumbering film is basically just an excuse for Ireland to change wigs every ten minutes, her Southern belle accent is also particularly annoying. Does she end up taking a bullet? Could there be a merciful higher being in existance to save us from her dreadful performance? If you're curious: watch it, if not: then don't bother. It's not the sort of movie you remember well the following day. In fact the most memorable part of LOVE AND BULLETS is the last 20 seconds. So I've just saved you wasting approx 102 minutes and 40 seconds of your time."
3,Great CD--But Caution: This is the English Version,"If you are like me and want the ultra-cool French version, you need to order the Import. I didn't know this and got this one--I wish Amazon had mentioned this in the description. Anyway, the music is still wonderful, but to me it just didn't have quite the cache the orginal European version did."
5,"If you liked any of the hits, you'll love this CD!","I had heard the song ""Tu es foutu"" and really liked it. When I found this CD, I took a chance and purchased it. It's great! The songs are all fun, upbeat Europop, and they're in French (I was a little worried that I'd get it in Russian from some of the comments here). Some of the songs remind me of Boney M., Enigma, or St. Etienne. The CD is unusual in that I like every song on it, and I liked them the first time I listened to them!"
4,Excellent Album,"In my mind, this album is great. From the moment i started i loved it. There are two tracks on there that break the flow of the album, Ah l'Amour l'Amour & Va au Diable. I dont like these two songs becuase there flavour is totally opposite from what we heard for the first 10 songs.The use of the accordian with the music is spectacular. If the album removed those 2 songs as a whole i would have rated it 5 stars. The songs have catchy sounds to them, you want to sing along. I dont speak french, but now i can sing it."
4,Very lovely and loveable,"When buying this CD, I did not anticipate much other than a string of songs very similar to mega hit Tu Es Foutu. And this is pretty much what it is - mindless careless chansons in the best tradition of French pop that are good for a party or just good times alone or with friends (if they do not hate France, of course). And this is what I really wanted to hear, because sometimes we all need to just relax and smile and maybe dance and sing along and feel better after it. No music history is being made here, but French once again proved their ability to please and entertain without being pretentious."
4,Different music,"In-grid has one done one good thing, if nothing else: try a new music. In a moment when we are surrounded by English spoken dance musics, she decided to try French music with a twist. Well, the result is very good. It's not great, but good. At some point in the album you start to wonder whether you've heard that music already or not, because there are a few ones who sound very alike, for exemple Tu es foutu and In-Tango. Its good to hear a new kind of music, speacially in a time when France and dance music have a lack of imagination. Buy it, but knowing you probably won't listen to the whole album once. You'll have to listen to it in parts. Creative good music. Best tracks: Dans ma memoire, Pour toujours, Mais la nuit il dort. One last thing: you gotta love the sense of humor and edgy sarcasm of the lyrics."
3,"Not what I was looking for, but good album","When I bought this I thought I was getting the French version of the album. I was not even aware that an English version existed, and all the sample tracks on the page were French. So I was really disappointed to find out that almost all of the tracks are in English. However, that's my own mistake and the album is still very nice. Her voice is just as perfect as ever, and the music is exactly the same. It's just that to me, it does not sound as good in English."
5,Excellent,"This album is genial, is one of the best albums I ever heard.I love In-grid. She's not like Celine Dion, she's In-grid, and this album worth.!!"
4,Pretty good picture quality.,"Pretty good picture quality, though at times a little light. The Howard and Miland movies were better. This leading man was a little bland, but the story was good."
4,Please Mom,"I love the entire v-smile line. It keeps my four year old from feeling left out when his Dad and big brother are playing their game systems, and now he can even have a big boy game like spiderman."
5,My 5-year old grandson gave UMPTEEN KUDOS!!!!!,"Graham was totally delighted and couldn't wait to play this game. He was challenged with the fruits/veggies/etc, but quickly figured out how to answer and really enjoys the game. good fun!"
5,awesome!,"Loved this hat, its well made and my boyfriend still shows it to everyone who visits a year later...safe to say, he loved it! If you or your man is a Steeler fan, you cant go wrong!"
3,Historical Romantic Fiction,"I first read this book shortly after its first publication in 1974, I was then in my mid teens and devouring romantic historical fiction almost as fast as the books were published. Philippa Carr, Victoria Holt, aka as Jean Plaidy were amongst my favourite historical authors, so it was with this in mind, I picked up a copy of this reissued first book in the Daughter of England series, in the hope that their appeal would be everlasting.Maybe my perception of historical romance has altered with the passage of time, as sadly for me the appeal seems to have been lost. Overall, I found the story rather laboured, with little really happening for the first third of the story. However, there is no denying that the book has been well researched, and to some extent manages to capture the heady and challenging days of Tudor England with some unexpected twists and turns in the story, which add interest.A nice story if you haven't read the series before."
3,The Miracle at St. Bruno's,"A young woman has to contend with a very religious but obviously lusty stepfather and with her burgeoning attraction to a young man who was discovered as a baby left in the local monastery and is considered to be a miracle.Having read some Victoria Holt novels, over the years, I picked up another one of her pseudonyms. The big difference in this from the Holt titles is the lack of romance and the definite emphasis on sex. That's not to say this is packed with descriptions of explicit sex, it isn't. The heroine's virtue is challenged all the time especially by her stepfather, which lends the book a slightly more adult emphasis. The main story of her relationship with the human miracle of St Bruno provides the book with a fairly creepy climax, as she uncovers the truth about him.So, an enjoyable fast paced read to pass the time. Off-beat enough to be more diverting than a bog-standard historical romance."
3,Awful characters,"A girl grows up in Henry VIII's England with her beautiful, temperamental cousin.Pretty good job of evoking the feel of living during religious conflict, less so at producing an interesting story. The narrator is a wimp and cousin Kate is a selfish terror who has to dominate every situation. I gave up about a quarter of the way through."
5,Pinmonkey,This is a new band for me. I hadn't heard from them before. The lead singer has a high voice perfect for harmenizing. Their really good.
4,"Blue-Grass, Roots Music, Alt Country?","Whatever you call this music, Pinmonkey has a great sound. I'm not much of a fan of modern country, but this CD and this band are great! The many original songs, such as ""Black Train,"" have an old-time country sound and thoughful lyrics. Their covers are also very fresh, especially ""Augusta.""I saw the band in Iowa in July 2002 and they sound great live. Their new stuff (catch ""Barbed Wire and Roses"" on CMT or the better country radio stations) promises that their next CD, due in October, will build their reputation."
3,Measure Theory -- where are the axioms??,"Halmos was a lucid mathematical writer but his ""Measure Theory"" is dated 1950 and so antedates by two years Rohlin's definitive axiomatic discussion in Doklady Nauk USSR 1952. The attempted axiomatization by Halmos and Von Neumann in the the late 1940's failed and was withdrawn by its authors. Someone who is seriously interested to learn measure theory, with an approach based on the notion of measureable homomorphism, should visit Rohlin's publications and at least one other modern book.WH Cobbs Narberth PA"
4,Gone But Not Forgotten: Maori Melodies,"This particular album of the Voyager budget series is said to be no longer available; thus, this review is for those intrepid music lovers who will search alternative sources. (1) There are few good recordings of Maori music, which makes this album particularly worthwhile. The sound is excellent, the music is strong and powerful on some tracks, beautifully melodious on other tracks. The tunes here are of the typical Polynesian harmonies and contemporary in feeling. (2) Do not be confused with the cover photograph of a Maori meeting house: it is a stock image and is used on different, inferior recordings. (3) No text of explanation is provided, leaving us in the dark about location, group, translation and nature of the songs. (4) The music is sweet and enjoyable. (5) The popular introduction to Maori culture came to Americans from the movie, The Whale Rider. If you are able to obtain this album, that film's spirit will continue. Happy hunting!"
4,"Solid figures, but still a bit pricey for what you get.","Man I have to say, thank goodness we can get these at discount. Paying 50 bucks for just 5 figures is a bit of a stretch believe me.Still, this kit is overall pretty good. You get two whole sprues of weapons: the Thunder Hammer/Storm Shield combo, and dual Lightning claws. The modeling is pretty nice overall, but adding the acessories like the crotch plates, and other bits is a bit difficult given how round and smooth the armor plates are.These guys will definitely form a core of your close assaults so make sure to make a good size group of them, definitely shop around if you can, they really are overpriced given how few figures you get."
1,Underground hip hop is dead,"Da Blaknix should stick to hip hop rather than underground, to gain more fame and respect. All this album ever talks about is gangstars in the club and rum. It's not a good album, not cream of the crop, if this is the path they decide to take, thier music career will fade.Don't buy this, really."
4,poetry from Vietnam,"The poetry of Visions of War, Dreams of Peace is moving, in part because most of the poems have been written by women who were nurses on active duty during the U.S. war in Vietnam. From their position, they could speak of what they saw as the deaths continued to mount all around. Many of the poems are awkward and sentimental, many rely on limp rhymes, many wear their hearts on their sleeves. Most ache with wounds that will never heal. The authors' courageous struggle to face the eternal suffering of war, to try to find words to express how others' suffering has deeply moved them, gives some of these works a rough edge that cuts the reader to the soul."
5,Ever wondered why you think and do the things you do?,I was absolutely flabbergasted when I read about my color. How could anyone know who I was and how I think. It reinforced my thoughts of life from the past to the present and into the future. It also showed me that I am not alone in my way of thinking and living life. I have a much greater understanding of people after reading this book. It's just fascinating! Thank you Pamala.
5,truly enhances your ability to understand people,"Life Colors is an interesting and fun read. You learn to understand and predict people including yourself. You also learn that the world could not be perfect without everyone, no matter what color they have, and that there is no best aura color to have. The the best you can be is true to yourself."
3,Not The Best,I found it difficult getting an accurate reading off the questionaire. It's okay as a reference book once you get a picture of your aura taken.
4,Good pillow for the price,"I bought two of this pillow to replace pillows purchased at BBB four months ago (and which have since been torn apart by my overzealous boston terrier, who likes to nest when napping). While not as ""squishy soft"" as the ones from BBB, and thus not as nice to lay your head on, I think these will last us quite a while. They are sturdy and serviceable, and the ""doeskin"" fabric is remarkably easy to clean. I've already had to take a damp cloth to both to remove some dirt and dog slobber, and both pillows look almost brand new after drying in the sun."
4,Dark and soft,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the pillow is well-constructed and is covered by very soft, luscious material. However, the color is a bit darker than pictured. I am still keeping mine though."
5,"Caution, Jimmy Scott may be habit forming","This is one of his best CDs. If you like Jimmy Scott you must have this Disc. If you are just discovering him and you buy this CD, you will be rewarded but, take heed, this wonderful CD will leave you wanting more. It could hook you on Jimmy Scott and Freddie Cole as well, who has marvelous duet with Jimmy Scott on 'When you Wish Upon A Star'!This CD, 'But Beautiful' is indeed a thing of beauty!"
3,The Title Says It All,"Yes, one more reason to hate foreigners, they take all the good parking places and evidently can shoplift with immunity. Ok a little simplistic, the dust jacket spells this book out pretty good, he has collected all the crimes these guys have done over the past 30 or so years and documented it, everything from parking tickets to murder. The book wasn't bad, it was written well enough and was interesting. He did not submerge you in needless facts, but kept the book moving. If you are interested in the title of the book then you probably will like it. I would not force it, if you have half an interested you probably will get bored."
3,Random Number Especific Ideia,"If you are looking for this book probabily you are facing a big problem, for sure it can help you in any way."
3,Misleading Title,"This is just another name for LRB's 2 cd set ""Where We Started From"" and ""One Night In Mississippi--Live"""
5,For Ones Who Truly Enjoy Epic Fantasy,"Intelligent, witty, and intriguing, Elantris is a perfect book. That's about it."
3,"Interesting concept, but...","I find that I am very much in agreement with M.Jacobs and dennster on their reviews of this book. I would give it 3.5 stars. Elantris seems somewhat over-hyped. Interesting concepts, but the characters weren't developed well enough to compellingly hold my interest. It left me with an impression of being lighter than it should have been, given the course of events in the novel. Don't get me wrong, I will check out this author in the future, but this novel had me pushing my way through it just a bit, instead of being totally pulled in."
5,Entertaining,It's a sweet story and the fact that Raoden is stricken with a horrifying and disfiguring disease really turns me on.
5,Good story.,"I noticed the parallels regarding the nobility class and religion that Sanderson replays in his Mistborn novels, but on the whole--this is a good read. It wrapped up rather abruptly in the last fifty pages or so, and I found that a bit dissatisfying, but it's not bad for a first major novel. The Mistborn series is also worth your time."
4,Elantris,"Quite enjoyable, but not as densely realized a world, nor as engaging a set of characters as The Way of Kings, which to me is fully 5-stars."
4,Elantris review,"Brandon Sanderson is a wonderfully original and imaginative fantasy writer. It's like coming home, to read another one of his novels. This was no exception."
5,Sanderson,"Loved this, had to buy the book. :-)Sanderson is amazing and I've read everything he has written! He is one of my favorite authors now."
3,Sanderson's First,"Sanderson's first book has a fascinating premise but, as other reviewers have noticed, it is troubled by some common ""debut novel"" problems. I read the Mistborn series before Elantris and was excited to read another Sanderson book. For those of you who were disappointed by this book, please give Mistborn a try; the difference is night and day.Elantris has three major threads: Raoden/Elantris, Sarene/Kae, and the Priest/""Outside Threat"" thread. The Raoden/Elantris plot was well-done and kept me engaged in the book. The ""Outside Threat"" thread dragged and felt like it was added in obligatorily rather than as an organic part of the story. I ended up skimming some of those parts. I suspect he started with the Elantris premis and the character of Raoden and added on other parts to make it a full story. These problems, as well as characters who are less developed than his later characters, make Elantris a book you should read after you are already a Sanderson fan."
3,Deserves 3.5 stars,"Not the greatest work ever, but very good. It seems to drag at some points, but the mythology and history of the world are compelling, and the characters feel real. Even the bad guys are given back story and motivation. The story draws you in and keeps you interested. It does feel a bit incomplete, like there's supposed to be a sequel, but I guess we'll never get one. The work stands on its own, but never achieves greatness."
5,Best Fantasy Book in a long time,"A friend of mine recommended Brandon Sanderson's Elantris to me years ago, but I kept putting off reading it, thinking it'd just be another fantasy novel, but boy, was I wrong.Even with my really busy schedule, I managed to finish the book in two days, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. It was very well written, and had lot of interesting twists and plot points. It was also a lot different from other fantasy novels, which made it even more enjoyable."
2,Meh,I think a hundred pages could have been easily edited from this novel. It would have helped the pacing.
2,Disappointing novel,"Having read Sandersons Warbreaker earlier this year i was excited to read another single volume fantasy novel. I assumed that the story would be a solid read seeing as it has had solid reviews and a 4 and 1/2 star rating. I was dissapointed to say the least.The politics of the story is my only gripe, but a big one no less. It seemed that the first 200 pages were bogged down with nothing but Victorian era intrigue and politics. This is interesting if spread out in a span 100 pages, but the book seemed to focus more on the manouvering of several groups to gain the throne of a kingdom and less and characters and a true story.Extremely disapointing. I have to say that I intend on reading his Mistborn trilogy but with lower expectations than I previously had."
3,Good Book. 3 1/2 Stars.,"I enjoyed this book. It's definitely not as good as Sanderson's later works, but it's reflective of his fertile imagination. I loved the premised and enjoyed the plot. The characters were just okay and the ending wrapped up a little too neatly, which is why I don't rate it higher. Don't let the overhyping spoil it for you. It's a fine, middle-of-the-pack fantasy."
4,Very well written,"The book is written in Brandon's characteristic style and has elements that appear in his later books, such as Mistborn. Since it was written at the start of his career, it makes sense it wouldn't be as complex as his later work, but it is still a good book. If you liked it, I recommend reading the Mist born series. It will blow you away!"
4,"Fantasy, Politics, and World Destruction?","Elantris is a really interesting premise. It is a little slow at first, but I promise that reading it is worth it. It is, as always, really well written and chalked full of humor and surprises. Highly recommended with a cup of cocoa!"
2,Just Ok,This book was just Ok. In some ways it was very unique because of the setting but I found the characters to be too perfect with no flaws which made them a little boring. I found myself trying to hurry and get to the end for the big climax which was again unique but it didn't make up for the lack of character development.
2,Very very long with little forward momentum,"I like the concept of Elantris and I bought it because I really liked Mistborn (another novel) and Orson Scott Card raves about it on the cover...This is a good idea that overstays its welcome. There is no forward momentum to the story. The merchant-king angle does not remain logically consistent. You have these brilliant businessmen who have no common sense. Tons of exposition in the dialogue. Then the ending is rushed through with several 'revelations' that seemed a bit convenient.Read Mistborn, which is a very worthy novel by the same author."
3,Not that great,"I expected a lot more of this book. The story is interesting and there are some original ideas in the setup and plot. But the writing was a big letdown to me, and I never really got into any of the characters. ""Flat"" is the best description I can come up with. Wouldn't recommend this book to friends."
3,"Great storyline, drags on","Although Elantris has a great storyline and a well sketched out main character, the perspective of the story keeps shifting over to people you dont give a damn about. While desperately wanted to get back to Raoden, you have to get through about 60 pages concering Hrathen and that feminist women who I can't remember the name of at the moment. That being said, the whole while you are reading the story you're practically DIEING to get back to Raoden, but are forced to sit through the social views of Princess Feminist and bad boy Hrathen I myself stopped reading 500 pgs in."
5,Intricate and beautifully worked,"Sanderson created a deep and complex world with characters that are fleshed out and real. I appreciate how he crafts this story and brings the reader along without having to do a lot of explaining the world. Though there is a complex social and magical history of the world he creates, I felt as if I were experiencing the world first hand, not having it told to me like I had a lot of catching up to do. Intrigue and adventure, smoothly written and immensely exciting. One of the best fantasy books, strike that, one of the best books I've ever read."
4,Elantris,"4.5 stars. I enjoyed this book. Brandon Sanderson is good at creating different ""magic,"" so it isn't like the magic in every other Fantasy novel you've ever read."
2,Disappointment,I listen to the first disk and said this is not worth my time.I passed and I'm disappointedChuck
5,excellent,"just a fantastic book,i loved it,very original and outstanding story,love the characters and story"
3,"Nice ideas, mediocre writing","I loved the idea -- city of the blessed/damned and the way the world interacts with it. It is probably one of the better ideas I've encountered in fantasy recently. The characters were pleasantly drawn, except with perhaps a little too much irony. Similarly, the dialogue was a bit jarring: the prince and the princess particularly sounded like a couple of cocky, fairly smart college students. However, the worst were the author's declarative, ""god-like"" proclamations: ""X woke up, not yet knowing he was cursed,"" ""Y thought she was a bride but in fact was already a widow,"" ""Z thought his fancy shoes were still safely at the cobblers' but in fact a small elf, carrying a red bucket full of slime had already dumped the contents..."" (Ok, I made the last one up.)So, great ideas, fast-paced plot, mediocre/poor writing -- not bad for a first-time author. If he improves as a writer he has real potential to become a pre-eminent fantasy writer."
1,not very good,"I have to confess I couldn't finish it. It was too silly and unserious. I had very high expectations from having read all the glowing reviews but the book itself was awful. Sanderson can write well and tell a story well, look at his bringing the moribund Wheel of Time series back to life, but this one was a misfire."
4,Pretty good - worth reading,I was impressed with the level of detail that Sanderson was able to achieve in a one volume fantasy book. The story and the characters were both engaging and compelling. I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to someone looking for a good fantasy read but doesn't want to commit to a series.
4,Elantris,"Very good read. I couldn't guess what the ending would be and I love that about a book. This story takes you to a whole new world that sounds fascinating to live in. The fall of a great people, a horrible king, and hope that is just barely out of reach that only one person can restore. Great story with great characters. The ending leaves you hoping there is a sequel..but I don't think there is."
1,Beyond Belief,I really can't understand why this piece of infantile drivel has garnered so many stars ! It has so many things wrong with it describing them would fill a book.Do not waste your time.
1,Missing pages,If the book hadn't been missing 30 pages in the middle I would've rated the story itself as a four. Hopefully it was just my book that was missing those pages and not just a printing error. I would like to buy the book at some time but will have to look at a physical copy before I purchase.
3,an ok first novel,"Like other reviewers, I found the protagonists too perfect and unbelievable. I enjoyed the whole Elantris concept. The conversations were not believable (similar to the Honor Harrington books?). I found the names of most of the characters to be forgettable and confusable. There's not much action that happens until right at the end, and as some people have commented, some of it seems to happen just for stuff to happen."
4,Great job for a first,I really enjoyed this story and can't wait to see his next novel. The characters are enjoyable and the story is paced well. I recommend reading it!
4,Great Book,"This is a great book. I really like Brandon Sanderson's writing. I especially like how the ""bad guy"" ends up saving the good guys in the end."
3,worth the read,"Good stand alone srory...which is nice since everyone and his brother / or sister is trying to be Tolkien. Its a shame he couldn't do the FINAL book in WoT in one.Write a good story that you can tell in two or three volumes. Or better yet, One. Jordan, Martin, Stirling....all HAD good stories and then decided to milk them for the bucks....probably publisher pressure."
2,Flat and Tedious,The book's characters are flat. The author puts too much detail in without advancing the story at all. There is no development of either plot or character. He could have told the same story in fewer than half the number of pages. It is not worth the time. Don't read it.
2,Definitely a first novel,"This was Sanderson's first novel and it shows. This book was almost embarrassingly bad compared to the Mistborn Trilogy and the books he wrote in the Wheel of Time. The characters are flat, the political and military situations unrealistic, the story is predictable, and the prose is amateur. If this was the first novel I read of his, I probably wouldn't read another."
4,Very good storyline for the Fantasy lover,"I am no professional book critic by any means, however, I am one who does not like to see repetitive storylines and likes for depth to be in the arc of the story. I loved this because of it's originality, the book is fairly easy to follow along with, and it follows different people at one time."
3,i guess if you like this kind of fantasy,"if you want a well written, well structured, calculated story with detached characters and a semi predictable relationship/ending then this is your book. i really wanted to like this, to get into it and loose myself, to really care what happened next...but I couldn't. For me it was devoid of all emotion. so if safe, intellectual stories are your thing then get it. it was well written. personally i prefer messy, emotional, unbalanced characters and stories that have characters that are closer to real life."
3,Decent,"Not on Mistborn level but still a readable book. I must admit, I started and finished another book while midway through this one because nothing was happening. Would recommend if you like books that cram all of the action in an insane,cluster-!#$@ at the end."
5,Vegan Natural (Organic Corn) Kosher Choice,"Vegan. All natural with organic blue corn. Kosher. Crispy and thin, but not crumbly. Great taste. Good value. Economical size. Chips came through shipping extremely well. Beautiful package design. Very popular at last dinner party. Highly recommended. Reminds me of the chips I got at my favorite cantinas in L.A. and Baja. Seven stars. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out ""Vegan Grocery Favorites"" and ""Vegan Grocery Top Ten"" in Listmania. Your ""helpful"" votes count and will be greatly appreciated to benefit the search of others. Thank you."
5,Everything Brennen writes is worth reading,"Authentic, raw, real. if you want candy coated christianity don't read this. If you want how it really is,,, read this NOW!Refreshing real hope for the one who feels hopeless! love this author."
4,Battles and emotions,The Legend of Kamui is one of the rare Mangas that deal with fighting and battles without forgetting to tell a good story. Sanpei Shirato knows how to draw and to entertain. Certainly a Manga to start with.
2,Teaches Antiquated Programming Style,"While this book seems fairly comprehensive in terms of covering Dreamweaver's features, the author still hasn't grasped how to do modern, standards-based web design. He encourages people to use non-semantic markup (""I'm also fond of the <blockquote> tag, which indents text by a browser-defined amount..."") and to abuse whiz-bang technologies in ways that make sites less usable and accessible (""Flash Button objects are great for quickly turning out a professional quality navigation system""). If you need a reference for how to accomplish a particular task in Dreamweaver MX 2004, this book may be a good choice, but if you're seeking advice on designing a web page, please look elsewhere."
2,disappointed,"No.1: The product was not what I was expecting from the description. No.2: I gave all my mailing info when I ordered it, both physical and mailing, and still they couldn't get it to me. I get bills all the time--nobody else ever seems to have difficulty finding me. No.3: Every time I spoke to Amazon it was to a different person and had to give the same info again--no continuity and no practicality. I won't be ordering online again. Very disappointed that I wasn't able to get what I wanted."
1,ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz,Easily the most boring textbook I've ever read. The text makes me wonder why I'm even studying urban politics.
1,BORING,"This snorefest of a book is chock full of redieration from every other political based textbook I have ever read. This complete waste of a tree, is a pointless exercise in jargon and double speak. Spare yourself hours of trance-like boredom and buy something else."
3,Useful book,"When I read the title I thought it was written for scholars, but it turnde to be wrtitten for students or beginning college teachers. Its main advantage is blending the acadimic with personal reflections. it also includes some activities that help in writing and could be used in writing training. In general I recommend this book for any graduate student."
1,"IF YOU BUY THIS, YOU'RE A CRUEL, EVIL, FOX KILLER!","Don't support the cruelness that is the fur industry. Foxes are brutally beated and skinned alive just so you can have a ""good looking"" jacket. And you know what, this thing doesn't even look that good. In fact, it's hideous! Save yourself from being egged and go buy a sweatshirt."
4,"Touching, inspirational,","Ebony Pearls of Wisdom is a collection of poetry that was written to share. It is Curtis Michael's way of giving back to the world all that he learned the hard way. It contains hard core information on life and it's atrocities, as well as love, faith and hope and all it can do for you. It holds insights into the education Curits Michael attained through living. The poetry whispers compassion, sympathy and tears for those who still have a way to go. If more young men read this book, more would understand better the complexities they will encounter in life."
4,good book,"Nightjohn is a book about slavery. Nightjohn is a very good man. He teaches young slaves to read, write, and spell. 12 year old Sarny is a girl whose parents are slaves. Her mom is a woman who helps the slaves that get whipped.Nightjohn has only 4 toes on each of his feet. He got his big toes cut off by his master. He is a black man and once he is on to something he never gives up. He is a very good man because he wants the young slaves to know how to read, write, and spell.Nightjohn is a slave. He has tried to run away two times. He didn't get caught the first time. He stayed in a woman's house but hecame back the next day. The second time he ran away he got caught and that's how he lost his toes.I can't relate to Nightjohn because I am not a slave. I don't teach young slaves how to read, write, and spell. I liked this book because it teaches us a lot about how slaves lived back then and what it was like to live at that time."
4,Andy's review,"The book Night John was a book you truly never wanted to put down.The beginning was pretty slow because they really stretched everything outmore than it really had to be, but the ending wrapped it up perfectly.This book is about a slave named Sarny. Who was a slave at theWhite House and her master was old Waller, a very cruel man. But one daya slave named John came there. He said he wanted to teach Sarny to readand write. But old Waller was against slaves reading or writing. Sarnyand John both knew it, but John kept teaching. When Sarny learnedher first word, she wrote it everywhere in the dirt then rubbed it out.But right when Sarny was about to rub it out old Waller came and saw.Sarny just stared at him.I would suggest this book to strong 4th grade readers all 5thgrade readers and slower 6th grade readers because of how big thefont is and how short the book is. This book should only lasta week or so."
4,Tells you about slavery,"If you read the story of Nightjohn, you will learn how it feels to be a slave. You can't read or write, but if Waller, the slaves' owner, saw you reading or writing, he would cut off your toes or fingers. Or he even might have killed you! Nightjohn, written by Gary Paulsen, was a good book.Nightjohn was the main character of the book. John was a slave that could read. He tries to teach Sarny how to read. Waller didn't want the slaves to read because he doesn't want them to get together and make an escape plan.I think someone should read Nightjohn because the book tells you about slavery. The book tells you how the slaves work, sleep, and how they can't do much stuff. This story would be good for someone who likes stories about the past"
5,"Two eyes wide open, but the third is shut","NightJohn was a great book. It taught ma alot of things. As a young black americain I felt this showed that it is ok to be open to new ideas, and not be ashamed of teaching people new things, and learning in the process.I never knew how hard it was for slaves to live back then. If you are looing for a real tear jurker, this is the book. when you start to read this book you will not beable to it down."
3,Too Much Explicit Language,"I was not prepared for the language this book had in it! I did expect a few curse words to be included because of the subject matter. But I was not prepared for parts of the book to be totally littered with God's name being used in the manner it was. I was disappointed in this because, up till now, we have loved the Gary Paulsen books we have read. The book is very good and gives a good picture of what really went on. But our family, personally, could have done without the language."
4,For mature readers and Not appropriate for 5th graders.,"This book was assigned reading for my 10 year old son in 5th grade. Unlike some of Gary Paulsen's other books that are appropriate for this age group, this book contains the descriptions of a rape, a castration, and physical abuse of slaves, including the graphic description of chopping off of a slave's toes. Although the book would make an excellent springboard for a high school discussion about the abuses of slavery, I would recommend that you read it yourself before giving it to grade school or even junior high age readers. For a mature reader, the book was compelling and fast moving, which is why I have rated it 4 stars."
1,the lily,"This isn't a novel, it isn't even a short story. I was just getting settled in for a good read and then it ended. Definitely not worth six bucks."
3,NightJohn,"The protagonist is this girl who doesn't know how to read or write. The conflict is shes trying to learn how to read ,but she doesn'thave anyone to teach her.Summary is ;the master who ownes everyone buys this slave called NightJohn. He teaches this girl the first 7 letters of the alphabet. Then the master finds out so he cuts off two of his toes.I liked it when the little girl finds out how to spell the word BAG .She goes and writes bag everywhere in the dirt."
1,Nightjohn,The title of my book is NightJohn. Nightjohn is a historical fiction. the author of the book is Gary Polsen. The plot of this book is that a kid named Nightjohn gets kidnapped and gets tortured while he was at his grandma's house and was put into slavery. The book was ok but i didnt realy like it that much because it was for like 11 year olds not for 13 year olds.
4,Nightjohn,"The book i read is called Nightjohn by Gary Paulsen and it was a good book. Nightjohn was put into slavery and had to work all day. When he was brought in he was tyed to a horse. Nightjohn was naked and had cuts and scars all over his back and legs because he was not keeping up with the horse. When he got there he met an older lady that was going to teach him how to say the alphabet, and how to spell words and pray. One day the lady got caught and had to stand out in the hot sun naked and then she got beat by the person in charge. Nightjohn learned how to say the alphabet and how to spell out words."
4,Night John,"This interesting book holds many details on slavery, and how slaves tried to escape without being caught by their owners. This book does not have a lot of graphic details, but the author tells how the slaves were beaten, why they were beaten, and how they were healed from the whipped wounds.In the middle of the book, John, a man with cuts and scars , is sent to the main character, Sarny's field. Late at night John, teaches Sarny letters and how to read.This book is an interesting story on slavery and how John, later called NightJohn, can run away teach his own school,and how Sarny and himself were able to escape.I highly recommend you to read this book."
5,Nonforgettable Nightjohn,"Have you ever wondered what it must have been like to have been a slave on a Southern Plantation? If so, you must read the Historical Fiction book, Nightjohn, by Gary Paulsen. This book will have you so involved with the character, Nightjohn, and his twelve year old friend, Sarny, that you cannot put down this book. Nightjohn comes to live on the plantation that Sarny lives on and teaches her to read and write. He feels all slaves needed to be literate so they could understand what was happening around them and to keep account of their own lives. The struggles and hardships he goes through is unbelievable . This story is heartbreaking yet informative to readers about the true accounts of slave life in America. This book will certainly open your eyes about our country's past and how people were treated in this ""free"" land."
4,Okay,"I don't normally read Gary Paulsen, but I had to read it for school. I thought the book would be terrible, but it ended up being better than I thought it would. The main reason I give it four stars is because it was a pretty read."
1,Atrocious,"How can these atrocities be promoted in this country? Zero stars. I saw poor Beth Fenimore's picture on the stoptherod site and was brought to tears. You can see the sadness and anxiety in her face from being subjected to these archaic, barbaric methods. Beth, I send hugs to you for being brave enough to write the letter and confront this sick sadistic man. There is nothing Christian about these teachings."
1,God's word taken out of context and beaten into children.,"Again the word of a loving God has been taken out of context. This man advocates beating babies in diapers with sticks because sticks cause more pain then paddles, belts etc. He says not to be concerned about marks the spanking leaves on your child's bottom for weeks at a time!!! This is child abuse. There is nothing loving about it. What's more it's illegal."
1,Where's Roy Lessin so I can give him a beating,"This book is sick. What kind of God will allow child abuse? And the children are born in sin comment urggghh, I don't even know what to say. If this is how all my fellow Catholics think, I'd rather not belong to this religion"
1,Disgusting absolute child abuse,"I have just read an account of a child who was raised with Roy Lessins methods of child discipline. I am appauled and disgusted that any book by this author is allowed to be on sale - anywhere !How can a book which basically outlines how to abuse your child be published let alone be available to the public ? Spanking your child is one of the initial and most outright forms of child abuse. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK AND BE SUCKERED INTO THIS SICK FORM OF DISCIPLINE. A child is brought into this world to be loved not ridiculed and harmed in this way. The author should be ashamed. If I could have given this review no stars, I would have."
1,"A Better name for this book is ""How to Raise a Sociopath""","Unless you want to raise a child with reactive attachment disorder who grows into an adult with anti-social personality disorder do not read this book or use the abusive, sadistic practices it's author suggests."
1,100% pure child abuse - destroying a child for life!,"This is 100% pure child abuse! This is a book for people who want to destroy a child for life! The author as so many others dysfunctional ""Christians"" claim to know what God wants, and believes that striking another human being makes them ""godly"". What went wrong with this author in his child hood? The author is manipulating the Holy Bible to give support for his sick child abuse and own dysfunctional childhood. Child abuse is NOT a way of raising children, and certainly NOT what God wants. Nowhere in the Bible does it say to strike a child! Children are God's gift. Not a ""thing"" to control and abuse as the author thinks. The violence towards children by these sick ""Christians"" is disgusting. Christian means ""Christ like"" which means to be humble, loving, giving, forgiving, gentle. ""Discipline"" comes from Latin ""to teach"" - not to spank, or punish."
1,Not Centered in Love,"I had to rate this to post which is why you see one star.This book is simply not centered in Love. It is simply and cruelly about Control and exerting ones will over small children. Children are not manipulative but rather they LOVE you as their parent(s) and are excited to have you pay them attention. Loving attention hopefully but they will take what they can get. Please if you must have this book also consider reading other books such as: UNCONDITIONAL PARENTING and PLAYFUL PARENTING.As a child of very religious parents who was whipped out of ""Love"" I can assure you that it was not love I felt then or now. It was Fear.Raising my child with Love and Respect I am amazed at the difference. I am mostly over the grief of my own lost childhood because I see in my own child that I am breaking the cycle."
5,"Great, Crazy Hip Hop","I would really like to hang out with Edan. He just sounds like a cool, funny guy from listening to this album. I'm an MC, and their is a hidden track on this album called ""Mcees, Let's Be Friends."" Edan, call me up dude! This album is an astonishing debut, a better album than most MCees make in their whole career. The beats are dusty and lo-fi, but very funky, the rhyming is incredible, the scratching's dope, and the fact that Edan did it all himself shows how talented this cat is. If you love Ultramagnetic Mcees, Kool G Rap, MF Doom, etc., pick this up. If you, like me, are tired of Anticon/Atmosphere/ boring, pretentious caucasian art-backpack-emo-rap, than Edan is your man!"
2,"Sad,in a acting and content sort of way.",It seems that most of the B westerns of the thirties were full of bad acting with weak sound.Even the old John Wayne films of the era were of poor quality.But this story would have made a good paperback read.The movie was full of poor acting with the actors appearing to be reading the lines at times.But in 1939 I would have had a great afternoon at the theater with everyone else.
2,"OK, but...","This book is fine for people new to the topic. It details how events in past lives affect what's happening in the current one. Has only a smattering of info about life BETWEEN lives. Also tells of famous cases historically. But if you've already read very much on the subject, read Journey of Souls by Michael Newton (and see the reviews), which addresses much more about about life BETWEEN lives."
4,Thought-Provoking Book,"In this book (1986), Joel L Whitton works with hypnotic regression into past lives, and it is mainly about the ""in-between life states"" or ""in-between times,"" just like what the title stated. The responses from his hypnotized subjects in this book has emphasized that when the soul enters the body is varied: some reported it more towards the beginning of the pregnancy, others just before the birth, few right after the birth. This tells me that there is no experience as being the exact same, but there are certainly some similarities in some aspects. Also, it also talks about how our past lives can affect or influence our present lives, with some good examples provided.Personally, I have discovered this book to be quite thought-provoking about the meaning or the purpose of our lives. It is certainly a good book to have in hand. It's well-written, easy-to-read, and brings the reader to question about our lives and our purpose: to learn."
4,Life Between Life,Interesting and well written. Makes you think! I think it explains a great deal of things that I have wondered about in the past.
2,Theraband product is better,"I bought these as an inexpensive alternative to the Theraband bars. They are not of the same quality. I bought a green and a red one. There is not much difference in the resistance. They are much stiffer than the Therabars and more difficult to use. I was hoping to recommend these to my patients, but instead I recommend the original Therabars which are more expensive, but also more effective."
1,Syntax,"Compared with other translations of Confucius this one suffers from a singular handicap. The syntax of the English translation is simply not English. I assume that it attempts to mimic the Chinese syntax, but the effect is to render most of the passages nearly unreadable for an English speaking reader. Unless you need to have the original Chinese on hand, this book is inferior to most of the others I have read."
3,An uninspired translation,"For reasons that are hard to fathom, this translation of the Analects of Confucius has gotten a lot of good press. In actuality, it is uninspired and derivative. Furthermore, the translator's notes show a cursory knowledge of the secondary literature, and a fairly banal understanding of the text itself.And isn't it a little precious to be writing a translation under a pseudonym?Other (equally good or better) translations of this work include those by D.C. Lau (Penguin Books), Arthur Waley (Vintage Books), and James Legge (Dover Books)."
3,after years of .....,"well i bought this book back in college I was getting around to see what i have not review and i can tell you this book was horrible (i got an A in my class) but the book is very crude and I stop reading it past page 15. I was very confused after this, as confucius said: ""what can i say"" :) enjoy"
1,Turned off by translator's comments,"I can't read Confucius in the original so I really can't speak to the accuracy of Simon Leys' translation (or should we use his actual name - Pierre Ryckmans?). But without a doubt he feels it is the standard against which all others should be measured, as he constantly passes judgment in his Notes section on all who have gone before and finds each generally lacking in some way. Add to that his efforts to impress the reader with the breadth of his literary knowledge and his decidedly conservative social comments (another reviewer also commented on his anti-gay bias) and I'm left with a translation I would just as soon skip."
3,"Pay more, get more-- than what you need","After my purchase-- with a steep price for a CD-- I realized that this one does contain all the popular Boney M songs, which is exactly what I was looking for; however, it also brings a number of songs which I never heard or much liked. So, you decide, but if you're looking for the songs that you know and like, you might be better off downloading at 99 cents a piece, and come up with a much better selection for yourself."
5,Review,"I received this in what I concider in record time. I even got a bonus another music cd. A thank you for getting this to me. The best service I had received.Thank you,Howard"
5,The Greatest Hits-Boney M,"For the past couple of holiday seasons I would hear a Christmas song played on radio stations but could never find out the name of it or the artist. Finally, this past season I found out it was called ""Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord by Boney M. I had never heard of the group but a search revealed that they were popular in the 70s mainly in Europe. After further searching I found their Greatest Hits CD on Amazon and ordered it thinking that Mary's Boy Child would be the only song I liked. In fact, I really like the entire CD. Really glad I found and ordered it...I listen to it often."
3,"Respectable CD, with one problem...","While this is a perfectly respectable disco CD, I'm disappointed in my purchase. Buyers should beware that the song ""Rasputin"" (which was the reason I bought this CD) is cut short on this disc. How disappointing."
2,Somewhat disappointing . . .,"I really liked the d20 Ravenloft book, but this one fell short. It only covers about half of the lords and includes a prestige class that should have been in the first book. Here, the class just takes up space that could have been better used with more darklords. Or, better yet, they could have made the book bigger to include more of the lords. I would have gladly paid more for a more complete work.On a positive note, the updated stats for the lords are useful and necessary for a Ravenloft game. And we do get new artwork for Azalin and Azrael . . ."
1,The worst service I ever had,"They didn't send me the Gamemaster Screen, and I wrote some times but I haven't it yet. Ah, and the cover was different... the worst bought that I had by Amazon in all these years."
5,A Thurber Carnival,"A selection of sketches divided into two acts written for 5 men and 4 women by one of America's greatest humorists. Highlights include: ""The Night the Bed Fell,"" ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"" ""Gentlemen Shoppers,"" ""The Pet Department,"" and ""File and Forget."""
5,The Thurber Carnival,"I have had the book for ages. Was shocked a friend had never read so sent it to her as a gift. Funny,funny, funny."
5,A Pleasure to read!,A Pleasure to read!I throughly enjoyed reading the Thurber Carnival. It was a great collections of stories which kept me laughing and completely entertained!
5,FanThurbertastic,Where has Thurber been all my life? How did I miss reading him? I love this book so much I bought a second copy for my son. Great wit!!
1,Thurber by a golden oldie,"I first came across Thurber when I was 18 in 1943. The books were in hardback and of course very cheap in those day. I sampled one and then bought the rest. Thurber is very witty, very funny and is easy to relate to. His drawings are wonderful - simple and look so easy. I liked the essays and I loved the cartoons - the one I like best is a chap introducing his wife to a friend 'That's my first wife up there (she is crouching on top of a bookcase and this is the present Mrs Harris.' Another lovely one is a couple in bed with a seal above the headborad and thei wife is snarling 'All right, have it your way -you heard a seal bark.'Thurbers dogs are so evocate. His humour and give my three grandsons the Thurber Carnvival which they are all enjoying."
4,Almost a Classic,"March makes a compelling case in this text that he should be well entrenched in the second tier of American authors, if not the first. His WWI recollections do a fine job of bringing out the terrors and guilts of a war long forgotton and little remembered, except for the short period of the Twenties. If there is any shortcoming in this fine work, it is that it draws far too much from Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthologies. My guess is that March, who was trained as a lawyer like Masters (a former partner of the unethical (...) Clarence Darrow) grasped onto Masters' then-current work . It's not a heroic idea, but one that's occurred to me. In any event, Company K is a work that ought to be read far more than it is a century later. WWI [is] seldom remembered as the great trauma that it was in the US. Here's a book that tells how bad it was, and more importantly, why."
4,if HAL2001 and Racter teamed up to make an album,"After hearing and bouncing to several songs in a local music store, I spontaneously bought this very fun CD. With robotic voices, thumpy beats and a heavy synthesizer, it's the sort of thing that any child of the eighties would love. And yet, it's not at all retro.Satisfaction, the first single off the album, has this Stephen Hawkings robotic voice singing a duet with a female robotic voice. That woman's voice is present on the rest of the album. I also like the introductory monologue that starts out ""No Matter What You Do"". Although many of the songs have a similar sound, they are all very catchy and have me tapping my feet to the beat.The album is aptly titled Hypnotica, and this album could equally serve as a background to work or for dancefloor anthems."
2,Not for techno fans,"I purchased this CD because Satisfaction was catchy. Unfortunatly, the rest of the album wasn't as great. All the songs pretty much sound the same, and lack the variety in beats that Satisfaction offers. I wouldn't buy this for more than $5. I could get on a DJ'ing program and whip this album out in less than a day. You've heard one song, you've heard them all. I'm a HUGE techno fan, and thought this would be a new DJ I could add to my collection. Unfortunatly, I think this is gonna be a CD that gets more dust than spin time in my CD player."
4,satisfing,"Anybody who is in to techno will love benny benassi, he providesa real type of beat and provides a emotional reaction instantly.Pick it up!!"
5,ATTN all club heads!!,Benny Benassi puts something special in his songs. Each song has that sound that club heads crave. It puts me in that trance like state where I can feel the bass throughout my whole body. Theres nothing else like it.
