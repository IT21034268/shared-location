3,plastic,"I think this sign looks good, but it would have been much nicer if it had been made of metal."
1,Not As Described!! Terrible Packaging!!,The item I received is NOT what I ordered. It is a Steelers parking sign but not the same one in the picture. VERY corny. Unfortunate that I purchased this for a Christmas gift and do not have enough time to send this back to get the correct product. The sign is also too big for the box it was shipped in and the packaging is TERRIBLE. Whoever packaged it put the sign right up against the sticky part of the USPS flat rate box and now there is a row of sticky cardboard on the back of the sign. VERY DISSAPOINTED with this purchase and will NEVER buy from this seller again!!
1,So-called Muslims,"Whereas I have no intention of commiting myself to this issue, the facts remains the same. Salman Rushdie (May God Punish Him) did blaspheme Islam, a religion that claim more than 1.2 billion people in this world, and that cannot be forgiven. I wonder what the so-called Muslim writers believe in when they wrote their essays. To me they are not Muslims at all, they just claim to be."
2,Some bland ideas. Not very good.,"I bought this book after purchasing Prompt a Day (ISBN: 0-590-18738-4). While it is better than Prompt a Day, it is still very mediocre. Some of the prompts are OK, but most of these prompts are not open ended and don't lend themselves to thought provoking writing. After reading this book, I did have 325 more writing prompts, but I could have written better prompts myself. In fact, I find that that's just what I do while this book gathers dust on my self."
2,Most bolts were the wrong size,"I had to replace my timing chain cover because it was leaking some antifreeze on my 1996 302 Bronco. I already had the timing cover and water pump off when these bolts came in.The quality of the bolts are great and I am sure they will hold up over time. My problem with them is I only got to use 5 of the 15 bolts supplied with the kit. All the other bolts were about 1/2 too short to grab onto the block.Based on the description, "" For Select Ford 289-302 Aluminum Applications"", I would think it would fit my Bronco, but apparently not. I gave two stars because I should have contacted the manufacture about whether it would fit or not, but I needed new bolts in a hurry and I couldn't find any info online. These bolts are high quality, so if they fit, they would be awesome, but I have no idea what 302s they fit because they don't fit mine.I'm very disappointed I spent 55 dollars to only use 5 bolts but at least 1 of the bolts I that did work replaced one of my corroded ones."
5,quality,I ordered this for my harley tool bag and up in SD. I needed it and they are tough very good buy
1,Home Office & Small Busineess Accounting,"This may have been a great product for Windows 95 and 3.1 but for Window 7, not so much. I now have Peachtree 11 and have removed the other."
5,Excellent book,"I owned this years ago, and gave it away. Ended up buying another copy because it is so comprehensive and complete."
3,"content good, but WAY too many typos in code samples","I bought this looking for a good, cheap PL/SQL reference guide. I was happy to see the subject matter covered thoroughly but quickly, assuming basic knowledge of both general programing language constructs and SQL.On the other hand, many (OK, not a majority or anything, but enough to significantly annoy me) of the code samples include blatant typos. I have not gone looking for the actual downloadable code what goes with the book, so it is possible the typos were fixed there."
5,My favorite brand gowns. Always lovely,I have only bought this brand for years. I think they are the best quality!Please never stop making them Shadowline!
3,Disappointment from Shadowline,"I have often purchased this brand of 100% nylon sleepwear over the years. I find the alternative polyester sleepwear scratchy and uncomfortable, hot, and unable to breathe. I purchased two Shadowline gowns from Amazon. One of them is just fine, but this one is not. I washed both before wearing, and the hem unraveled and came out of this gown in the dryer. I also noticed the Shadowline gowns are now made in Mexico, no longer in the USA."
5,Just what I have been looking for in the stores and could not find.,"Love this gown. I could not find this type gown in any of the local dept stores for a long time. They pack so well in a suitcase and can be wash, hung to dry in a hotel and worn the same night. The color is very pretty as is the design. Very pleased with this purchase."
2,"gown not same color as robe purchased, but appeared to be dark purple but actiually was lilac. The gift was for my mother","The gown pictured appears to be dark purple. I purchased a robe to match. The gown is actually lilac, not dark purple as shown. So the gown and robe set I purchased for my mother does not match. As a care giver for my elderly parents I have no time to send anything back. I wished the gown and robe matched. The shadowline products are expensive and superior. My mother loves them. She would have loved them even more if they had matched."
3,"Bought as a gift, recipient said it was too sheer (in the pink)","I bought this and the matching robe in pink as a gift.Recipient (my mom) said it's too sheer for her and is essentially see-through. That might be ok (frankly, it wouldn't bother me - sounds nice and comfortable), but it's not for her.If you are questioning among the reviews whether it really is too sheer, I can say that at least in the pink and at least for my mom, it is."
3,It's okay if you're older,"I bought this gown for myself. I find that the material is a little bit more stiff than all of the other nylon gowns I've purchased. The design also reminds me of something my grandmother would wear however, it is a pretty comfortable gown."
5,Yeah the live stuff is horrid...but its worth it for Spectre,"This album features 3 amazing studio tracks (well technically there is four but I didnt really enjoy Invocation III)Anyways, yeah most of the live songs are horribly recorded, but overall its worth it for the studio tracks, because they are THAT good. 'Spectre(love is dead)' has become one of my favourite Christian Death pieces ever since I picked this one up. Get this, and then get ""Decomposition of Violets' , another live xian death with Rozz album, and that album in my opinion, is the best live album Christian Death ever released(Iconologia is very good also, but 'Decomposition' is slightly better IMHO). Get this album for the studio tracks, and then get The other live album.Overall- 5 stars- David Painter 1334"
1,"Not what I expected. I had heard the music in a TV movie and was impressed, but dislike the CD",Was not what I expected. I did not enjoy. One piece sounded like an orchestra tuning up.
4,Large but Lovely!,"I needed a pin-up light for a dim area in my kitchen, between the fridge and the stove. Lights appropriate for that use are hard to find. This light is very attractive and mounted easily. It is a little larger than I expected, and also a little larger than I wanted, but it does the job well and was reasonably priced. I am very please with it, and would recommend it to friends without hesitation."
2,"The ""wrong"" Bernstein performance....","Do NOT be fooled, as I was, in thinking that Sony here is refurbishing Bernstein's legendary 1959 performance of the Shostakovich Fifth Symphony with the DSD process - similar to what BMG/RCA has done with the wonderful SACD reissues of some of their greatest performances in the 'Living Stereo' series.No, whereas the date of this recording is interestingly nowhere to be found on the CD, front or back, this turns out to be the 1979 performance Bernstein recorded while on tour in Japan, and which in no way approaches the incandescent 1959 performance, which being 20 years older, COULD and SHOULD have benefited from the new DSD technology. But go figure...For shame, Sony...."
5,GREAT PERFORMANCE,"I do not own this cd yet, but I have the lp version. I'm reviewing this to boost the star rating. This is an absolutely thrilling performance. I have never listened to the famous fifties Bernstein/Shostakovich 5th symphony recording, but David Hurwitz has heard both and says they are about the same except this 1979 version is better (or more closely) recorded. I really don't care about other versions of this work because this performance is so tremendous. If Shostakovich were reincarnated and offered to conduct a private performance of this music with the 100 greatest musicians in the world it still wouldn't top this Bernstein '79 performance."
4,this is a really sweet film!,"I love this film it's sweet and happy and it will cheer you up.It was intended as a vehicle for Judy Garland therefore you see alot of her in it. I thought the songs were good and it did well when it came out back in 1938. Judy Garland looks plumpa nd childlike, so sweet you just want to eat her.lolno seriously you will enjoy it, not just saying that b/c I'm a major Judy fan Its a grand old film!"
3,High Efficiency but too blue,These bulbs are High Efficiency but too blue. I hope there is an alternative with a warm white (yellowish).ThanksJohn C. Briggs
3,for academic use only!,"this text was required reading for an uper division Modern Art History course i have taken, which requires no prerequisites. the book, however, certainly assumes previous indepth knowledge of topic. overall, a very informative, technical book."
4,Textbook for Modern Art,"I bought this book for a class, and for a textbook, it's definitely easier to read than most. Unfortunately, it covers a lot of material very quickly, as you must in class, and so jumps from artist to artist and style to style in a bit of a jerky manner. They make the transitions as easy as possible, I just wish we could get more information on the artists, like stories from their lives explaining some of their personalities before we move on to the next. It would make it easier to remember and differentiate between the artists of a period."
1,PURE BALONEY,"They should rename this book and just call it Baloney. It is another advertisement for Cook's products, and a waste of time to read. I read Wall Street Money Machine (I do not know why), and I have convinced myself not to read any more of his books (luckily I did not purchase either book). There is no content. The title is inaccurate as well. There are bull markets and there are bear markets. We have been and are in a bull market. There will be another bear market someday. In order to handle changing market conditions intelligently, this is not the book. Zero stars."
1,He almost got me for $700,"I found out about Wade on the radio and one lousy phone call almost got me in trouble. He sent me countless audio and video tapes which absolutely repeated itself over and over again. He got me to buy WSMM and BMB and the price was entirely too high for each. Follow his rule of thumb ""it's all in the meter drop."" Every time Wade sells a book, he doesnt need a good day on Wall Street, we, the success-starved public, do it for him. His books all repeat his videos. Now he's trying to push some home study course for $700 on me! If I threw the cash into Merck or Lucent, I'd have a better chance to make the money back that I would have wasted on the ""cabbie with a dream"""
1,Not what I call intelligent reading...,"If my I.Q. was less than 33, then maybe I would enjoy the book more. I found the text to be ridiculously simple minded. As its sole intent is to provide information, this book seemed to be a repetitous bunch of hog wash that seems unfortunately suitable for the average person. A shame it is to try to get people caught up in the thrill of making money and trying to entice them to sign Wade Cooks multi-thousand dollar seminars. As a successful options and commodities trader, I would suggest other than reading this book to learn about options. If one really wants to learn about optimizing with options, the CBOE is the place to start, with references of literature and other helpful learning guides. Invest in another book if you want to learn, buy this one for a good laugh."
1,Fraud,"This guy was suited by a lot of personal investors.Matter of fact you can find the law suits against him on the Federal Trade Commission web site: FTC.GOV In the search box type in 'Wade Cook'. There are about 31 hits.According to the FTC complaint, WCFC's (Wade Cook Financial Corporation) advertising and promotional materials contain express or implied false claims that Wade Cook had earned and consumers would earn extremely high rates of return - returns of 20% or more per month - on their investments using Cook's trading strategies.Another words, the man can't walk the talk."
1,"""Don't judge a book by its cover"" - don't buy it.","I have really enjoyed the other stock market books Wade Cook has published; but Bear Market Baloney is unfortunately full of baloney and advertisement. I was surprise to find this book one big advertisement for Wade's books and seminars. I would strongly recommend not purchasing this book and perhaps wait for paperback (if possible) or not purchase it at all. Lastly, it really concerns me the approach Wade took with this book and the marketing that lead up to the availability of this book. It seems obvious that your money goes directly to Wade's bottom line. Stay away from this type of deceptive advertising"
1,Phoney Baloney,Worst book ever written. It is basically a 100 page adverstisement with no content or genuine ideas. Don't waste your time. 'Nuff said.
1,More Slop From Wade Cook,He wrote Bear Market Baloney just before the worse bear market in 60 + years.Learn more about Wade on Google by searching for Wade Cook Seminars. Lots of interesting stories about Wade.
1,You can pay for his advertising,"This book is one"" big advertisment"" for his products and services. If you want the information that is in the book, buy any financial publication and you will have the answers as to why Mr. Cook feels the bull market will continue. However, if you would like to support his advertising budget get the book"
2,A Let-Down,"I've enjoyed wade's other books, especially stock market miracles, but this one was a letdown for me, mostly because a lot of it was rehashing what had been said in his previous two books. My advice: read his first 2 and ""Safety 1st Investing"", but don't worry about this one."
1,The Turkey Has Landed,"This is not worth the paper on which it is printed. I don't believe this book would appeal to many women. Men might like it because the main character, Alex Barnaby dresses like a bimbo and the main male character, Sam Hooker, is so full of himself. I couldn't even read his dialogue. He refers to himself as Nascar man over and over again.The plot is totally unbelievable and the main characters ghastly. No 30 year old woman is anything like that and I cringed as I read passages. Evanovich is a long way past writing young characters. It seems as if she just cranks the books out now for the money and it really shows.There are loads of characters, but none have any depth. One or two show promise, but then it is back more rubbish from Nascar man."
1,Metro Girl,"I'm a huge Evanovich fan and was sadly disappointed with ""Metro Girl"". You couldn't turn the page without reading the words ""Nascar Guy"" three times!! I think I'll just stick to the Stephanie Plum novels. ""Metro Girl"" was a waste of time."
1,Just Awful !,"I am a fan of Janet Evanovich, but this book is just not good work. The book was slow, boring and irritating at times. The whole NASCAR thing was way beyond annoying."
1,A pile of dog poop,"Every cliche is used, every stereotype is used, jokes are used and reused.Horrible book."
1,PASS THIS BOOK BY,"I BOUGHT THIS AT MY LOCAL SECOND HAND BOOKSHOP. THERE WAS A WHOLE ROW OF THEM AT 25 CENTS, WHICH SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE QUALITY OF A RECENT BOOK.I'D AGREE IT IS CARTOON FORMAT. THE CHARACTERS ARE STUPID, THE PLOTS ARE SOMETHING OUT OF A 1950S STYLE CARTOON STRIP, WITH THEM OVERLAPPING IN THE MOST RIDICULOUS WAY.THE CHARACTERS ARE NOT ENGAGING. IT WAS HARD TO FINISH THE BOOK AS IT REALLY IS FOR A JUVENILE READER, NOT ADULTS, AND PROBABLY NOT EVEN TEENAGERS. HOWEVER, I WOULDN'T WANT MY CHILDREN READING THIS RUBBISH.TIME FOR EVANOVICH TO HANG UP HER PEN I THINK. HER WRITING HAS GONE DOWNHILL OVER TIME, AND NOW IT HAS HIT ROCK BOTTOM.WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK - NO DEFINITELY NOT."
5,serious fun!,"I think I like Barney better than Stephanie. Both characters are great but I really enjoyed Hooker and the other supporting characters in the Barney series. In the Stephanie Plum books, you've got all this tension and question about Stephanie's relationships with Joe Morelli and Ranger. With Hooker, he's right out there with what he wants and it is hilarious. The friends Barney meets, Felicia and Rosa are a kick too. The story in Metro Girl is strong, the mystery has some nice complexity to season the hilarity. And as always, villains who meet up with a Janet Evanovich heroine are in for way more than they bargained for."
3,Passable Quick Action Heroine,"This is the first time I have read a book by Janet Evanovich, so my review is not influenced by any of her earlier works. I am well aware that she wrote the Stephanie Plum series which I have never read.Metro Girl is more of an action packed book, very fast paced. You feel like you are strapped in a racing car & you keep accelerating. Very little character development. Think of a comic strip where you have action heroes going thru their paces in the picture boxes, POW! WHOOSH! OOPS! BANG! SHOOT! SPLASH! You get the picture. It is this pattern from start to finish.Nevertheless, there is a plot of politics, double crossing, Miami lifestyle, Cuban men & women, racing drivers all thrown in.Read it like a comic strip or else skip it if you don't like this format."
3,a good read,"this was the first janet evanovich book i purchased,so i can not ""compare"" it with the stepanie plum series.metro girl is fun to read.felt somtimes like in the middle of an action movie. a good read!"
3,Good for a laugh,"MetroGirl was much funnier than the latest Plum novel, reminiscent of the earliest Plums.. The dialogue was witty and authentic. The plot was implausible but fast-paced. MetroGirl really didn't deviate much from the Plum formula of ditzy but lucky heroine plus horny hunk plus stereotypical, wacky sidekicks equal ridiculous mystery solved, but it was cute. Borrow it from the library or a friend. Don't spend your hard-earned money on it!"
4,Good read,"Always like reading anything Janet Evanovich writes. These aren't as good as the Stephanie Plum novels, but help fill the gaps between books in that series."
3,Definitely NOT her best,"Ok...I love Janet's books! I have read all 11 Plum novels(that includes the Christmas one) and I have also read all 4 ""Full"" novels she wrote with Charlotte Hughes. I can't wait for the next Plum novel and I was so mad that there were only 4 books in the Full series..and I also could not wait to finish Metro Girl. That's because I was so disappointed with it that I almost stopped reading it in the middle. I agree with another reviewer that it seemed like Janet just wanted to get the book done as fast as possible. I didnt fall in love with ANY of the characters like I did in her other books, and I only chuckled maybe 3 or 4 times. I laughed out loud in evey Plum book. I dont know what happened with this book...but Janet really needs to do more with her next one."
2,Mediocre at best,"This book would have been a lot better if the useless tangents weren't included in it. I would be reading some parts of the book and think ""what the hell does this have to do with anything?"" I submit also that the phrase ""NASCAR guy"" was completely overused, and it made the book seem rather redundant."
1,Stick with Stephanie Plum,"This was so boring, I was really looking forward to enjoying a new Janet Evanovich book until book 11 came out in the Stephanie Plum series. What a huge disappointment. My daughter is also a Plum fan and so I gave it to her to read to see what she thought and she liked it even less than I did.It was all I could do to finish the book, I didn't care what happened, who did it or why they did it. Ho Hum! Don't bother!"
2,This is the first...,"This is the first Evanovich book I've read, and I'm probably not going to go out and buy another one. It's not that entertaining. And I had real trouble caring about any of the characters."
2,Painful,"I used to be a huge evanovitch fan, but lately her books don't seem to be written by the same person. The story was OK -there were some funny moments -but overall it was painful to finish."
4,quirky and fun,This is a great book as long as you don't compare it with the Stephanie Plum series. Barney is NOT Stephanie and Hooker is NOT Ranger (or Morelli). In the beginning I was having a hard time not comparing them as the Evanovich's writing style is simlar in all of her books. The characters are quirky and likeable (other than Hooker can be a tad annoying with is whole NASCAR guy thing) in this novel and the sexual tension between Barney and Hooker is easily noted. I enjoyed the exchanges between them and the plot was quite entertaining. I even read this as I was walking the path along the lake -- I am glad that I didn't end up walking into the lake. This book had me laughing out loud a few times. Not the best Evanovich book I have read -- but pretty good none-the-less.
4,Metro Girl,Another one of Janet's wonderful and humour books but with all new charecters. It seems she can't write a bad book. I stil lilke the series best though.
4,a nice change of pace,"As a fan of the Stephanie Plum mysteries, I had to pick this book up. The lead character Barney is much more macha than Stephanie and has spent time car racing, fixing engines, kickboxing and other unsual things. So, when the Cuban mafia is on her trail, she's a lethal weapon that they can't control.I rather prefer Stephanie's more feminine way of getting things done, but Barney is a hoot, especially when she joins forces with her gay friend Judey. The romantic lead, Hooker, spends most of his time being a narcissistic jerk, so it's a little hard to accept his sudden heroism. And some of the coincidences and rescues remind me of the cavalry coming around the corner--a little too neat to be believed.Still, I enjoyed the change of scenery and the witty dialog. Evanovich is a master at getting how people really speak, a feat that's a lot harder than it looks."
4,Major Metro Girl Fan,"Metro Girl is a hilarious read. While it is not a serious novel to be discussed in college courses, it is a perfect beach read. In this novel, Alexandra Barnaby, ""Barney"" finds herself tangled in quite an adventure involving Cubans, missiles and bars of gold. While I will agree with some of the other reviewers that there are some loop holes in this novel, I did enjoy every minute of it. I found myself laughing out loud in more than one instance. I will be sure to read the next Alexandra Barnaby novel, Motor Mouth."
4,Good book,"I like the new heroine and hope to see more of her. Although I have faithfully read all the Plum books, I was getting rather jaded with a hamster that never dies and cars that blow up on a regular basis. Alex is a pleasant departure and Ms. Evanovich has kept the sense of humor going. The new characters surrounding Alex are a hoot and I hope that if Alex returns, they do also. A pleasant mixture of wackiness and fun."
4,Cute!,"First of all in no way did i see anything similar between Alex and Stephanie Plum. I think it was a descent story with fun characters. I have to say that i currently am reading Motor Mouth and, i think the sequel is better. Will there be another?"
3,"Good book, but something troubles me about Evanovich","I thought Metro Girl was a good book, full of humor, quirky characters and mild excitement. But I'm starting to feel that Evanovich's books follow the same formula. Strong, but equally vulnerable heroine (Stephanie, Jamie, Barney). Long and lean male counterpart (Morelli, Max, Hooker). Side female characters packing heat (Connie, Lula and Grandma Mazur - Vera - Felicia & Rosa). Some crazy, quirky dog (Bob, Fleas, Beans). It's like watching a Chris Tucker movie. Whatever he does...you see Smokey from ""Friday"". Now, I'm not saying that Evanovich's titles aren't enjoyable, because they are. I have most of them. But I would love to see her do something totally different and break away from the mold. I don't want to say that she's lazy...but I don't know any other way to put it. But if we're all buying her stuff, then why would she change up now?Please Janet. Suprise us with something different."
2,SAME OLD SAME OLD,"IF YOU HAVE READ ANY OF EVANOWICH OTHER BOOKS THEN YOU HAVE READ THIS ONE TOO BECAUSE IT HAS THE SAME PLOT, SAME HEROINE (BUT WITH A DIFFENT NAME) AND THE SAME LAUGHS. STILL ALL IN ALL I LIKE IT. IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO GET THROUGH IT BECAUSE OF IT'S SIMILARITY WITH HER OTHER BOOKS BUT I DID FINISH IT, THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS."
5,Great service,The book arrived in excellent condition and in a very timely fashion. Thank you for the great service.
4,A Nice Change,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. While there are many similarilities character wise to the Plum novels, these characters are different enough -- especially the lead character. It was nice to read a book that didn't have all the back and forth with the two boyfriend dilemna that never seems to resolve as well as not having to read about how many cars got blown up. I hope we hear more from this character in the future!"
1,Insanely bad,"Let me start out by saying I love the Stephanie Plum series and read all 16 of them in a month. This book however was stupid. The NASCAR Guy references were idiotic and offensive. The references to the gay character were stereotypical and offensive. The fact that a full cast of characters materialized out of the woodwork was mind boggling. I made it through four chapters and couldn't read any more. I skipped to the last chapter and the epilogue. That was more than enough for me. I bought the second in the series and plan to return it.Now I see that Evanovich is starting another series with a main character named Diesel -- hello, already used the name in the between the numbers Plum books. Not even going to pick that one up. She needs to get a little more creative and go back to the first 8 Plum books and see what made those so great because these books and the most recent Plum books have really missed them mark."
2,Alex Barnaby,"Janet Evanovich's new series introduces Alex Barnaby, a big sister out to rescue her missing brother. Several stolen cars and one hot NASCAR driver later, the brother is rescued and now it's the NASCAR driver's turn to rescue Alex, just in time to end the book."
1,Give Metro Girl a miss,"Ugh, what a ridiculous book. Very annoying characters and hopeless muddled storyline.This is the first book I have read written by Janet Evanovich, and I doubt I would ever buy another. At least, not with these characters."
5,Loved It!!,"This was the first Evanovich book that I read so I was not spoiled by the Stephanie Plum series. I have also read all of the Plum books and have enjoyed most all of them as well. ""Metro Girl"" (Alex Barnaby) is not quite the baffoon that Stephanie is but it was truly a funny and fun read. One of my favorite parts of the story was when she walked into the huge spider web in the tangle of trees and weeds. Very well written and once again Evanovich allows you to form extremely funny visuals. I noticed that most of the people who weren't thrilled with the book had read the Plum series first. I can understand how that would have spoiled them for the Barnaby books. So far though, ""Metro Girl"" was the best of the three books in that series."
1,Insulting,"Not funny, not clever and insulting.I am Hispanic. I live in Florida. I am a woman. I do not work in a cigar factory. This book is totally insulting to Hispanics. It is also insulting to gays. I thought society and authors had moved on from using racial or sexual stereotypes for cheap laughs.How old is Janet Evanovich? She writes as if it is the 1960s in terms of the Hispanics in Florida. The women don't all roll cigars, and never did. We don't carry guns in our purses. My mother is a doctor, my father a professor, I am a surgeon, my sister is a lawyer, my brother is a pharmacist. Yes, we are all originally from Cuba and not a gun between us.However, the racial stereotyping wasn't the worst of this book. Nascar man was, without doubt, the worst idea an author has had since the middle ages.The writing was lazy, repetitive and used the same jokes over and over again."
1,Stinks worse then exhaust from a 76 Vega,"I have never read anything by Ms. Evanovich before reading this so I don't have her other stories to compare to but I can say this isn't a good one to start with. I give it one star for the overall story. If she would have left out the 15 times a page reference to NASCAR in the first 5 chapters it might have not been so bad. But when she misspelled Talladega (she had Taledega pg 104 line 16) it was ruined for me being a NASCAR fanatic. The stereotyping of every character was another annoyance, the Hispanics, the gays, the ""NASCAR guy"" all stereotyped horribly, even the crime family was stereotyped...it was a story full of clichés one after another. The story had potential (if you took out the NASCAR and stereotypes and clichés) but it fell flat with the ending. It was so unbelievable and so forced it sucked the air out of me. And to think this is going to be a series for her. I can hardly hold back my enthusiasm."
1,Take A Pass on the Metro,"Note - I think the book might have been better if I read it myself. I listened to the audio version and found the voices of the characters to be incredibly unappealing - particularly that Nascar guy who referred to himself as ""Nascar Guy."" That got old really fast.The Plum and Full books are much better!"
2,Extremely unbelieveable and juvenille,"This was terrible. I am giving it 2 stars cause I normally like Evanovich books (i.e., the Stephanie Plum series) but this book sounds like a high schooler wrote it. The plot was so unbelievable that I cannot believe a publisher would agree to print this. The Hooker character was extremely obnoxious. It made me hate NASCAR. Who goes around calling themselves Nascar Guy like it was some kind of superhero? I hope I never hear the word NASCAR again because of this book.Nothing in this book is even remotely possible. The entire storyline was so over the top that I couldnt wait to just finsh it and move on to a better book. I only read the entire thing because it was all I had with me on a long train ride. I really wished I had purchased the In Touch and Star magazines instead.Anyway, read the Stephanie Plum series instead."
1,Obnoxious characters - embarrassingly bad book,"I can hardly believe that this is from the same writer that gave us the Stephanie Plum Series. Ok, the Plum series has become a bit stale, but Metro Girl is absolutely terrible.Barny and Sam are the sort of people you would leave town to avoid. I'd never want to read any book about them again. The whole story was written for 10-12 year olds, not adults. If you are stupid you may like it. I can't believe anyone, adult or teenager, would think it an acceptable book.They don't come much worse than this."
1,"Metro Girl - should be titled ""Made You Hurl""","Only suitable for the trash can.I disagree that men would prefer this book than women. Crap is crap, no matter what gender, age or sexual orientation you are.It starts bad, gets worse and then rallies onto to an....even more implausible and stupid ending.Sad to think that books this bad can get published.I used to laugh at my wife's Evanovich books, even though the bounty hunter ones are basically all the same, and became boring. Metro Girl plumbs new depths and we are both agreed this is the last Evanovich we'll buy.You couldn't pay me to read anything by Janet Evanovich now."
2,Definitely not a Plum read...,"I can't believe I'm writing this since I absolutely love Janet Evanovich and her Plum series, but this book (which I had eagerly anticipated) disappoints. While I did finish the book (it's a short read), the plot seemed so contrived and I cared so little for the characters (NASCAR guy was just annoying) that I just didn't even care how it ended.Hope the 11th Plum book is much better than this!"
3,Plums are better,This book was okay but found myself putting it down to read later. Not like the Plum series you want to read from start to finish in one day!!! I knew it was going to be different from the Plum series but was expecting better...Not!!! Hope she doesn't write another to go with this. Just keep the Plum series going!!!
2,Not a Plum,"Pleasent, but not laugh out loud, it's a bit disappointing when you expect the wonderful humor and pizazz of her Stephanie Plum series. Metro Girl is just not up to that fun - but is worth reading. I think I might wait to buy it in paperback when it comes out."
3,Hopefully not a new series...,"I am a huge fan of the Plum series, but I really hope this is not the first in a new series for her. (At the very least I am in denial that it will be.) It's not that it is an awful book, it's just rather dull. The actual story was sort of interesting, but the characters lacked..........well, character. I got the feeling she was trying to pull together a cast of likable, mildly funny, and interesting people, she just unfortunately was not able to do so in my opinion. It's just difficult for me as a rabid fan of the plum series not to compare Metro girl to it, but there really is no comparison. If your an avid fan you will want to read this book no matter what, but beware you might be disappointed if you are expecting the laughs, lovable characters, and fun adventures you found in the Plum series."
3,Not Stephanie Plum,"I am an avid fan of Janet Evanovich and was sadly disappointed with Metro Girl. It was cute, but not up to the level of the Plum Series. It was disappointing, because I've been looking forward to the release since it was announced. Like other reviews, the scenes moved too quickly at times and not quick enough at times. There were a couple of times that details were given so fast, that I thought I had skipped a few pages. I had to go backwards to find out who brian (a dog) was. Some of the characters seem just through in to give the"
2,Why is it Evanovich can only write Plum books?,"I am a huge fan of the laugh-out-loud funny Stephanie Plum books but every non-Plum Evanovich book I've tried has been just awful. Not just ""not-as-good-as-Plum"" awful - reallllly awful! I don't know how they can be the product of the same writer. I was willing to assume that her partner in the ""full"" series did most of the writing (they are terrible too) but Metro Girl and Love Overboard are billed as pure Janet E. I just don't get it.. Anyway, save your money and don't waste your time on anything that isn't Pure Plum."
3,Not bad for a Stephanie Plum-less book,"Metro Girl was funny, quirky and fast paced, much like the Stephanie Plum novels J.E. so marvelously writes. ""Barney"" blunders her way around an attempt to locate and rescue her missing, errant brother. There is suspense and intrigue, plus a hot guy, in her quest. Although I did find the book entertaining, it lacked the character definition and detail that made the Stephanie Plum novels so good. Barney and Sam Hooker (NASCAR guy he repeatedly reminds us) have a shallow feel to them that makes it hard to visualize them as real, breathing characters. Their assorted cast of ""helper"" characters are funny, but seem to be almost forced upon you in an attempt to keep to some predetermined book-writing guidelines.The book was not bad, but hopefully J.E. will take more time to develop the characters if this turns into another series of books."
1,boring,"Didnt even finish it. I had no emotional investment in any of the characters. Needed more character development. By the middle of the book, I realized that I didnt really care what happened to these characters so I put the book down and never picked it up again."
2,Boring and unbelievable,"I picked up this book hoping it would be similar to the Stephanie Plum series, but this was just boring. Not to mention the situations the characters found themselves in were totally unbelievable. Who's going to go out for crabs when there are killers on the loose looking for you? Better yet, why would you sit in an unlocked car waiting for your crabs when killers are on the loose? I did not find NASCAR guy attractive at all, the story line was lame, and really, the only likable character is Judey."
3,3.5 stars--I've read this before,"If you're still thrilled with the Stephanie Plum series, you'll love Metro Girl, whose heroine is Skipper to Stephanie's Barbie. Everybody else should wait for the paperback, because there's nothing new here. Moving the setting from Trenton to Miami doesn't count."
3,entertaining but needs work,"I have read all 10 of the Stephane Plum mysteries which give you the best laugh from each cover to cover. Janet has some work to do in developing this interesting cast of characters. By the time I was finished with the book, I had totally forgotten that Barney's name was really Alex.I am also a big NASCAR fan and I found Hooker's bio to be a little ""out there"" and not a true characterization of the real NASCAR driver.I hope she doesn't stop with this book but keeps going. She's a very entertaining mystery writer."
5,METROGIRL AND NASCARGUY ROCK!,"I read this book in two days! You have to have an imagination to go along with the book. This is the first book that I was able to read written by Janet, but found it very funny and very good. I think I'll get another one of her books. The book was a movie in my mind and I enjoyed it."
5,A WONDERFUL STORY,I have read some of the negative reviews and do not agree with them. This story was very entertaining and fun. I listened to the audio tape and it was a pleasure to drive to and from work! I highly recommend it and look forward to the new adventures of these characters.
3,Nascar Racing Style,"Evanovich introduces Alexandra Barnaby, an automotive engineer from Jersey to the deep south Nascar circuit. Fans of Stephanie Plum maybe disappointed as ""Barney"" lacks the Plum sparkle. It maybe because she doesn't have the supporting cast of well defined characters.It has just enough mystique to keep you reading and laughing with Evanovich's rip roaring style. But the action is fast and furious.Barney hooks up with Sam Hooker who has the reputation of going through women like there is no tomorrow.Good light reading for the summer doldrums.Nash Black, author of ""Qualifying Laps"" and ""Sins of the Fathers."""
3,Not her best book,I love Evanovich but was a little disappointed with this one. Just not her best book in my opinion but it was ok.
3,Kept my interest,It wasn't the best book I've ever read but it was entertaining and I was able to get through the whole thing in a relatively short amount of time.
3,metro girl,"I love the Stephenie Plum books, read everyone and waiting for more.I expected a bit more from Evanovich with Metro Girl, it was a goodbook but not up to her abilities"
1,Yuk!,"I've loved everything I've read by Evanovitch--till this! I got to page 100, and I decided that life is too short to waste on this drivel! Thank God that all I invested in Metro Girl was a trip to the library and not the price of the book!"
3,Contract not met.,"In the promos it was said to be bigger, badder, sexier than the Stephanie Plum novels. However, in reality, Metro Girl is the younger, paler sister. It is entertaining, good for killing time while waiting in line for 12 hours for a Metallica concert. But, not what was promised. I really enjoy the Plum novels and am very much looking forward to the next. However, I'll wait for the next Alexandra Barnaby to come out in softcover."
1,A waste of time and money,"This was the first Janet Evanovich book I've ever read and it will be the last. ""Metro Girl"" was silly to the extreme, with implausible situations and nonsensical, repetitive dialogue. (Everyone who meets Barney tells her how hot she looks, and ""NASCAR Guy"" refers to himself as ""NASCAR Guy"" a hundred times). Not funny, just annoying. This book is the sort of pure fluff that might entertain a 13 year old. Don't waste your money or your time."
2,She's no Stephanie Plum,"In Metro Girl we meet Alex Barnaby, a ""grease monkey meets barbie"" Stephanie Plum wanna-be who has just arrived in Miami after receiving a mysterious phone call alerting her that her brother may be in trouble.In true Janet Evanovich style, Alex soon finds herself smack in the middle of a huge mess that spans across Florida and into Cuba and involves stolen treasure, the US/Cuba trade embargo, Fidel Castro, the FBI, random hit men, a missing girl and one insanely annoying NASCAR driver/love interest named Sam Hooker.The story itself is a little far fetched. But that's not so much what bothers me. What I just couldn't get past was the really bad character development. Sam Hooker (aka ""NASCAR Guy"") was so annoying that I was actually hoping Alex would go for one of the bad guys.I really hope there is no sequel to this story. But if there is, I'll know to cross it off my list."
1,What an awful book!,"Complete and utter crap. Sam Hooker aka Nascar guy and Alex (Barney) Barnaby are very poorly developed characters and I would never read anything with them in again. I had numerous attempts at finishing this book because it annoyed me so much. Normally I read a book from cover to cover in one sitting, even if it means staying up half the night. I hated wasting my time on this, but hopefully my review will prevent others buying Metro Girl.I hope there are no more books in this series."
1,Very disappointing,"I eagerly wait for mail including a few precious books via airdrop and every book is read numerous times by everyone else down her. I lent this book to quite a few people and without exception, everyone said they couldn't finish it because it is so bad. How embarrassing!I had heard that Evanovich was a good author, yet this has to be the worst book ever. I can't imagine anyone is stupid enough to find it even vaguely amusing.I'd rather read penguin's pissmarks in the snow."
3,Absolutely nothing,"When you read a book and you know that is the kind of book you'll laugh and you don't even have a mirth-time reading it is a worthless book. I can't tell you that you won't laugh at least thrice, but when you finish this book you won't have a smile in your face and you also won't learn anything in this book. I'm not saying that this book is a waster. But if you have another book to read just skip this one."
1,Blah,"I agree with one of the previous reviewers - you will have no emotional investment in this book as far as the characters are concerned. On top of that, the dialogue is ridiculous and unbelievable, the plot is predictable, and the writing is terrible. Too many ""he said"" ""she said."" And we all know how an elevator works - you don't have tell us they waited for the doors to open, walked inside, pressed the button, went down, then got off when the doors opened."
1,Completely horrible,"This is my first, and likely my last, book by Janet Evanovich. After seeing her on Good Morning America promoting this book, I was dying to read it. From the way she described the book, it sounded incredible. Not the case at all.To me, her writing style was horrible. It reminded me of something a child in Grade 4 would write.I think the plot may have had potential but the events in the story were just too rediculous to ever believe.I think I'll stick to a real author - James Patterson."
1,Metro Girl,"This has got to be the worse read yet. I have read all her other books and loved them. If I would have seen the phrase ""nascar guy"" one more time, I would have burned the book. I would not waste my money buying this book."
3,Disappointing,"Alexandra Barney is no Stephanie Plum. The entire book is derivative of the Stephanie Plum series. Her romance with ""NASCAR guy"" has the candlepower of a weak match. The minor characters like ""Judey"" are interesting, and much like the wacky people in a typical Stephanie Plum. And the end. What was Janet thinking. She wraps up the story and 2 pages later the book is finished. What a disappointment! I'sm not sure that another visit with Metro Girl is in my future. But it is better that the ""Full . . . "" Series Miss Evanovitch wrote with C. Hughes."
1,Ugh -,"Nothing is more revealing than an author pumping out fodder for the masses rather than writing a decent book. It is awful to see Mrs Evanovich has joined this throng of pulp producers and it is particularly sad for her fans. There is nothing to redeem this book. A jumble of stories, one dimensional characters, suggestive comments, humorous(?) asides, trite and unrewarding.If I were on life support and someone was reading this to me, I would prefer to have the plug pulled."
1,So bad I couldn't even finish it,"Total crap. Relies on schoolyard gags like fake dog poo. Really awful characters - Barney and Nascar Man are vomit inducing.I threw it out without finishing it. I have never done that with a book before, but it was so bad, I couldn't bring myself to endure another word."
2,Just Readable,"I'm sorry. I tried. There wasn't much to grab you with this book. Definitely not up to the Stephanie Plum books and I think I really enjoyed the ""Full"" series Janet Evanovich writes with Charlotte Hughes better than Metro Girl. With the Plum books there is sexy Ranger and Joe Morelli. With Metro girl - Hooker in no way inspires lust or like and halfway thru the book the term ""NASCAR Guy"" was really starting to get on my nerves. I hope she wasn't modelling Hooker on Earnhart Jr. because it really wasn't a very good compliment to Earnhart the way Hooker comes across in the book. No, pass on the hardback edition and if you really feel you have to - buy the paperback or get it from the second hand store."
3,"Not terrible, but not at all great.","I got this book as a gift, so have no regrets about spending money on it. If I had spent my own money, I might have wished I'd checked it out at the library instead. I love the Stephanie Plum series, love the characters to the point that I ""miss them"" when I finish a book, and have even gone back through the entire series twice. But Metro Girl did not have the same effect on me.The main character is not as engaging or funny, but you can tell that Evanovich tried to make her so. The male character is annoying and I found no appeal to him either. The story line was mildly interesting, enough so that I did finish the book over the period of a few nights. It is a fast, easy read but does not leave you wanting more.Evanovich should stick to what she does well and leave the rest alone."
3,Good idea but needs more...,"This new adventure series has lots of potential - potentially interesting characters, plot, chuckles and action. However, in reality, it only has an interesting plot which moves so fast and jumps from one scene to another so quickly sometimes I thought I had skipped a page.The characters, if filled out a bit more, would be great fun but I am left feeling that Janet was in a hurry to get his book onto the stands. I have read all of the Stephanie Plum series and find my self laughing out loud, even in public, when reading of her exploits. This new heroine has lots of spunk but I really did not get to know her friends much. The book is mostly one-liners and sadly reads like a comic book. If this continues I may not be such a fan in the future."
2,disappointing,I was really disappointed with this book. I have read everything this author has written and this is so sad.
3,Not bad,"Alex Barnaby is worried when her brother Bill, who is working in Miami, disappears along with his girlfriend Maria. She finds herself reluctantly joining forces with Hooker, a handsome racing driver, whose boat Bill has stolen. Together they set out to find the missing pair, helped and hindered by a variety of other characters.This is quite a good story with some amusing moments, but I did not find it nearly as funny or exciting as the Stepahine Plum novels, none of the characters interested me very much, and the heroine, Alex, seemed insipid compared to Stephanie.If you haven't read any Janet Evanovich books before, my advice would be to skip this one and go for the Plums, they are very much better than this."
1,As Bad As It Gets,"The only thing good about this book was that a friend gave it to me for free.The writing was pre-adolescent stream of consciouness. The characters were one dimensional, the plot was thinner than Kleenex and I have read better humor on a bathroom stall."
1,NASCAR guy blah blah blah,"As interesting a read as the Plum series, this Metro Girl read was blah blah blah. Every other page kept repeating NASCAR guy this or NASCAR guy that. Did Evanovich just run out of new ideas to write for an interesting story?? She used the cut and paste feature one too many times. It was definitely an overkill of NASCAR guy stupidity and moronic phrases that just made me throw the book at the wall. I am sorry that I bought this overpriced hardcover because the book truly did not warrant the purchase."
2,"Stephanie Plum's Alter Ego: blonde, Baltimorian, and boring","Janet Evanovich promised her fans a brand new character. What we got was Stephanie Plum as a race car driver/mechanic with blonde hair. Worse: Alex is not nearly half as interesting as Plum, but Janet Evanovich works way too hard to try to make her to be.The writing is not as natural as the Plum novels. The storyline a bit contrived. And confusing. The love and/or sex story? Nothing like what we have with Stephanie, Joe, and Ranger.I am severely disappointed in this much-anticipated novel. Instead of handing us Alex Barnaby, Ms. Evanovich's time would've been much better spent expanding on the story she gave us a few years ago with Visions of Sugar Plums. Instead of Alex, she could have followed up on the story she started with Mary Alice. Now THAT was interesting.Alex... not so much. Sorry, Janet. I really wanted to like this one, but it was an extreme disappointment."
1,Not up to Janet Evanovich's talent,"I am a Janet Evanovich fan - love all of her Stephanie Plum series and full house series. Eagerly, I bought Metro Girl as soon as it hit the store and, boy, was I disappointed! It lacked the humor and zip of the Plum series. I plodded through the whole book hoping it would get better, and, at one point, I thought if I read ""NASCAR guy"" one more time I was going to either upchuck or start tearing the pages out. I guess this was an attempt to be funny but it sure got old in a hurry. Seemed like ""NASCAR guy"" was uttered on just about every page - maybe more than once per page."
2,So disappointing!!!!!!!!!!,"I was so eager to read this book I bought it and started it the same day, it's been a week now and I just can't continue it's a drudge and I'm returning it. Nascar guy come on!"
1,Not worth reading,"I didn't believe this book would be as bad as some of the reviews I had read, but I was wrong. It was every bit as bad, in fact worse.They are right - one-dimensional characters that either stereotypes or obnoxious or both. Too many plot lines, all poorly developed. I think it is aimed at brain-dead trailer trash, but it even stoops lower than that.A terrible waste of paper."
1,Not worth the money,"An absolutely nothing book. Easy to put down and very forgettable. In fact I have forgotten most of it, except that nascar man was awful beyond belief. Barny was not a good character. Lots of action, all unbelievable. A stupid book for stupid people by a below par author."
2,why NASCAR?,"I am disappointed in an Evanovich book for the first time. I love her books and I love NASCAR. Silly me, I thought there would be some connection. Every time Hooker referred to himself as ""NASCAR guy"" I thought I would lose my lunch. Never would a true racecar driver refer to himself as ""NASCAR guy"". Really gross. Had I not been all excited about a new Evanovich book coming out and the big lead up that it had something to do with racing, maybe I wouldn't have been so disappointed. I am 3/4 of the way through the book and so far, other than just mentioning racing two or three times, there has been no connection. Janet, why didn't you just leave NASCAR out of it completely? If you were going after a bigger market, you just blew it. Sorry... just rubbed me the wrong way."
1,"Really, really bad",I have read just about everything this author has written and this is the worst. I feel used. Thank God I got it out of the library instead of spending money on it! The characters are totally retreads from other books and the plot doesn't even make sense. Someone piloted a boat off a reef with a fatal gunshot wound to the head!? It hurt to finish this book and I almost didn't.
2,Found it Lacking...,"I have just recently discovered Janet Evanovich (within the last 8 months) and I loved her Stephanie Plum series. With this in mind, I went right to ""Metro Girl"" hoping to get the same wit and charm from the setting and characters. Alas, I was wrong. I felt completely detached from the storyline, and there was no feel of being there. The Plum series, though you may never have been to Trenton, made you feel like you were there. Ms. Evanovich's attempt to place us in Miami, etc, were feable at most. Sorry, Janet, but this wasn't up to par for me.I am happy to say, however, that I uncovered a new and aspiring author. I purchased ""Waves of Deceit"" by Marlene de Velasco and let me tell you, I couldn't put it down."
1,As bad as it gets.,"Plum books took a decline, but none so bad as this. The characters were very boring. I admittedly only got half way through. I just could take it anymore. What a waste of money. Sorry Janet. You need to find an objective editor. This was really bad."
2,Miami madness that is hard to swallow,"In this first book in the Barnaby and Hooker series, we meet Alex Barnaby, who has gone to Miami to find her brother after call from him was interrupted by a woman screaming. While she has an office job now, she used to be a gearhead and loves fast cars. It is clear that there are several people/groups searching for her brother, including NASCAR driver Hooker, who has had his boat stolen by her brother, Bill. They team up, with a lot of bad sexual tension. The plot gets more and more improbable, with implausible situations and ridiculous fixes to bad plotting, ranging from sunken treasure, Castro, fruit sellers with guns, and ending with a NASCAR fueled raid on a warehouse. The characters failed to draw me in, and while I am very willing to suspend disbelief for a good story, this was not a good story. This was a disappointment, and I don't know if I will read the second in the series."
4,Fun book,"The story in general is good. I found the NASCAR references to be over used and knowing the industry I am certain there is no driver out there that would call themselves ""NASCAR Guy!"""
1,Skip this one,"Metro Girl is embarrassingly bad. Mismatch of plots, poorly developed characters and NASCAR man is so awful I felt like ripping out the pages.Janet Evanovich is much better at writing older characters. She is out of touch or very dated when writes young characters. The older ladies working in the cigar factory are funny. The dog and cookie down the pants incident was juvenile and a lot of the other action puerile.Alex (Barney) Barnaby is hard to like and the book is not sexy or very funny. It tries too hard and repeats the jokes over and over.Skip this one and read either the early Plum series by Evanovich or go to another author."
1,A no star novel,"Awful. Unremittingly awful.If you want to become brain dead then it is quicker hitting yourself in the head with a brick. Reading Metro Girl takes longer and is more painful.So bad, words fail me."
2,Stephanie Plum Lite,"This was sort of ""Stephanie Plum-lite"", right down to the tomboyish main character (Barney), obviously forward love interest (""Nascar Guy"" Sam), and crazy sidekicks (gay best friend and Cuban cigar rollers). And I think that's why I didn't love it. While you expect a certain voice and style in a Janet Evanovich book, this was a little too copycat for my tastes. Though I confess that I did like Sam, who was what you would get if Ranger and Morelli had a baby. I'll probably read the second one if I feel like something light I can read in a day, but it won't be something I'll rush to get to."
2,Cheap knockoff,"A knock off of the Plum series, but not quite as good. All Evanovich did was give the characters new names and jobs."
1,Can't I give it zero stars?,"This was my first and will be my last Janet Evanovich book. Like so many have already said, it is soooo not worth the time to read. It was so bad that I couldn't bring myself to finish it... it was just plain AWFUL!"
3,fun but not at all believable,"this book is a fun read. not a must-have, can't-put-down, but fun. don't expect the story line to be very believable or compare to our beloved stephanie plum. i will read the next story though."
5,My first Evanovich book,"Likable characters, action, romance, lots of laughs. What more could you ask for?I started reading one of the Plum books and to be honest I preferred ""Metro Girl."""
4,The Good and The Bad...,"The games are definitely some of the best Red-Wings Games! The video quality is good, packaging is nice. Except that the DVD's don't fit properly in the case. You have a hell of a time trying to get them out. One already started cracking. I was going to give 3 stars because of this problem but the media on the discs is so good..."
2,Set Contained No Disc 3 - Just 2 Copies of Disc 2,"Well, I was going to give this a four star, as it provided games I'd otherwise be forced to watch clips of via YouTube, but the set arrived with a Disc 1, a Disc 2, another Disc 2, and a Disc 4. Thanks for robbing me of a Disc 3 - and a copy of the 2002 game that went into triple overtime that was half the reason I bought the thing.Fail."
3,RED WINGS,"I LOVE HOCKEY AND I LOVE THE RED WINGS, BUT THE HOST ON THIS DVD ACTED LIKE HE WAS BORED. I THOUGHT THE DVD WAS GOING TO SHOW GREAT GAMES, NOT HIGHLIGHTS. THE NHL NEEDS TO SALE THE GAMES OF THE PAST ON DVD.GO NHL."
3,a little heavy on game time,"This is an entertaining DVD with lots of good material, but do you really want to sit through entire games again? Sure, they are great games, but we really don't need to see each one in its entirety, highlights would do. Having said that, I really enjoyed the rest of it. Not something I'd watch over and over again, though. Maybe renting it might be a better way to enjoy it."
1,Don't Bother,I thought this book was really horrible. Very predictible and not very well written. Too mushy for my taste.
1,So awful I wish I could give zero stars,"This book contains two stories.The first I read, but it was so poorly edited for both punctuation and grammar that I wanted to scream. Also, the story sounds great, but there are huge gaping holes in the plot from start to finish. The hero and heroine go from not being in love to madly in love and then the story is over. You don't get to find out what caused Kieran to fall in love with Syren nor is there any resolution. Yes, there is one great review. If you read it, you pretty much have read the book.Because I was so frustrated and disgusted with the first story, I couldn't even try to read the second. I hate to give a bad review, but I would rather have been warned how bad the story was before buying something rather than only hearing it was great. Especially since the book wasn't cheap. SECRETS OF THE SEA is not worth its money."
4,Cool sounding music,I was listening to this being played at a business the other day and Shazaam'd it. Heard about 4 of the songs and it sounded really relaxing. I would recommend this to somebody who likes celtic music.
2,Warning: Needle is letterboxed,"Both movies are on one side of this DVD. Gorky Park is anamorphic, meaning the picture expands to fill the screen on a flat panel TV. However, Eye of the Needle is letterboxed, even though that is not indicated in amazon's description of this DVD. Letterboxed movies play as a small rectangle in the center or the screen, which I find very unsatisfactory. You can use the zoom feature on your TV, but that results in diminished picture quality. Had I known the format of Needle, I never would have bought this disk."
4,"Read the book, and then watch the movie.","I enjoyed the interpretation for the silver screen. Not as involved as the book, but enjoyable. William Hurt is a great actor."
5,Spinal Stabilization,This book has helped me through a very difficult time with a Sciatica problem that put me in bed for two months. I used this book to help strengthen my core and make it possible for me to get out of bed for a full recovery.
3,Harder Than It Looks,If you were like me and bought this online based on the cover- you may have found the exercies pretty hard to do. I am in good shape but I found I couldn't do alot of the exercises without falling over- A good laugh at first but not fun when your back is sore.- Try only if you have been working out for a while and it will take time to get the hang of it.Own the book two months now and only doing some of the exercises.Hope this helps.
5,Back Pain Solved - This book really helped me!,"I have had recurring low back pain on and off for about 4 years. It was the result of an injury I had sustained about 13 years ago, but I did not know that until I read this book and talked to my physiotherapist about the transversus and multifidus muscles and exercises. The book took the time to explain the REASON why no other treatments had worked - they were all trying to strengthen my back instead of retraining the muscles that had been affected by the original injury. Yes, it took some time to retrain the muscles and some serious effort, but nothing else had ever worked before, so what did I have to lose. Get this book and find a physiotherapist who is willing to help you retrain the muscles. I am now training again in a serious way and do not have the ""twinges"" that had been part of my life for the past 4 years.Brilliant - thank you very much for this book."
3,Fun but tough!,"I bought this book for the ball workouts that I have been adding to my programs. Many of the exercises are very basic and if you have been around the gym , you have seen them- look else were for more challenging exercises.For the hardcore the last few pages show some hard moves to use. this is a good start."
5,Fantastic book,"This is simply a wonderful book and I can strongly recommend it to anybody with back problems. I had damaged my spinal column with too much power tennis (discus protrusions, arthritis and spondylosis) and suffered considerable pain. After trying about nearly every other therapy on earth, including machine-based reha-training which made things still worse, I simply followed these exercises and my back is now 90% better. All you need is a little patience - it takes time, but it is worth every effort! If the author ever reads this rating: Thank you for writing this book!!"
4,Good service,The bulb that originally came with this lamp was defective but the company replaced it quickly and since then it has been working well. I bought it mostly for the styling but the light is good too.
4,Good release with much for the fans.,"Featuring two non-album tracks, this release is certainly something for the fans. Wake Up Call is one of my favorites from Testify, but this version is the album version, so there's nothing to come from here. (The promo single features a radio edit, but that's only a shortened version of the album version, so fortunately they included the complete track here.) The two extra tracks are not among his best non-album tracks, but they are not bad either, and of course, hadcore fans might be pleased by having two tracks released on one single."
2,Ok book,This book has many 1 sentence questions with 1 word answers. These types of questions do not represent National Registry.
4,Doesn't read well but this book is unique.,I read this book on a research project on human sexuality. Of the millions of titles available in our school library this was the only one dealing directly with sexual behavior between animals and humans. Other surveys touch upon bestiality but this is the only book I am aware of that is wholly dedicated to it. The author begins with a personal anecdote about her close encounter as a young woman. The only problem is that the translation does not read well. I hope that a better translator pops along in the future.
1,Sickos,"Ya'll are sick. I can't believe this trash is being sold on Amazon. What a trashy website. This is what comes after gay marriage along with polygamy, incest, and statutory rape."
4,"Dearest Pet, good read","I bought this book because it is something that i can relate to. Overall I give this book 4 stars. It is a rather poor transalation, it could be better but it is extreemly informative and i learned alot obout both the ""historey"" of zoophillia and about general sex practices that are conciddered ""unuasual"" by society at different points. it is one of those books that is hard to put down after you et into it. I must admit that i don't aggree with some of the veiws in it concerning peole haveing loveing relationships with thier animal lovers, and the only thing because of that that saves it from getting 2 or 4 stars is that informative nature of the book. Verry interesting and i lernt alot. I think it is a must have for any zoophile's bookshelf, or anybody who is curious concerning our sexual orientation.a Zoophile book worm DragonXXX"
2,clutching at straws,"Barely mysterious mystery, with major info given away by the cover design of my edition. While early Marsh was, like Christie, orthodoxically racist, this is latter-day, post-civil-rights Marsh, and thus has a black hero/love interest who is a ""well-spoken"" handsome doctor, a total condescenion bearing little feeling of veracity, and thus retains the mindset of racism just applied in a more humanitarian direction. Embarrassing.--J.Ruch"
5,Great soap...excellent pump dispenser..use it to make your own!,"I originally became addicted to foaming soap dispensers for economical reasons. However, the ones you can buy in the store wear out and are so small you have to keep refilling them. This is a great solution for the kitchen. This 1 liter bottle is GREAT...I could not be happier with my purchase. And, it comes in a 2 pack. So you get 2 dispensers--even better!! Highly recommend! Use it up and then make your own. :)"
5,The music of tranquility!,"""On Wings of a Dove"" is an incredibly beautiful CD. As a massage therapist, I use this wonderful CD for many many clients. It immediately puts one in a peaceful, safe place to be. Reminds me of the comfort of rain lightly falling on a window on a Fall day....I have used this music for several years in my massage practice and find it so peaceful....Five stars!"
5,"my favorite album, ever","I purchased this back in '93 when it was first released. It was my first exposure to Rozz and I instantly became obsessed with the man. The opening monologue just blew me away...so blasphemous and depressing, yet gentle and soothing. The whole album continues in this manner, wallowing in the depths of despair while maintaining a warmth and honesty that is very rare indeed. Rozz's esoteric and seductive vocals dominate this album from start to finish. The music sets a desolate atmosphere wherein his tales of terror and sadness transpire. His often ambiguous and absurd lyrics seem paradoxically wise and consoling. Despite its decidedly anti-Christian sentiments, it sounds very heavenly. I've been listening to it for over ten years now and it never gets old. But then again, perhaps I'm simply a freak."
5,great album...,"""The Path Of Sorrows"" is a song that was also featured on ""The Best of Rozz Williams."" it's basically the same on that one as it is on this. it's a great song, and a great album. anyone who liked ""the best of rozz williams"" will love this album! buy it."
2,Disappointing Follow-Up,"The first Philosopher Kings album was great. I was looking forward to this one, but was sorely disappointed to find that they lost their edge. Gone were the jazzy influences, and the funk, too. We were left with unimaginiative pop. Oleo is the exception, and an excellent song on an otherwise boring album. If you're looking for an album by the Philosopher Kings, get their self-titled one instead. That one's worth it."
5,Thoroughly pleased with my selection.,"If you like your music with a bit of edge, enjoy a bit of jazz with your rock, you'll love them. I bought the first cd with few expectations, I tracked the second down with great effort. It was well worth it."
5,"Great sound, upbeat, best album i've heard in years","when i bought the PK's first album i fell in love with their musical style and was almost dreaded getting this one. After all, how could they possibly top that album, I have never been so happy to be proven wrong. Very passionate sound in their music, every note and every word carry a feeling to it. Can't wait for their next album!"
3,Pen multimeter,"Good unit for the price, larger then I like but has many functions. Only issue so far is that the beep when using the continuity test is very weak."
2,Inconvenient to use.,"Display Too slow and too dark. Uncomfortable switches. Amateur accuracy, Does not recognize the HV / high frequency fields For professional use is not suitable."
3,Nice probe meter but fails as a logic probe,"The meter is nice, but the logic probe function is pretty useless. No audible indication and though the manual says it has an LED indicator it seems to only have a very dim LCD icon for high and low states."
3,ok,bought this to replace my blue point multimeter . this was a fraction of the price and it shows would like to find another blue point sorry
2,Bleh,The proportions are a little off and it does not come with another stud earring for the other ear; it should be worth no more than 5 dollars but oh well.
4,Cool Ear Cuff!,"I bought this ear cuff for my nephew for Christmas. He put it on immediately upon receiving it. It looked so good on him, I bought one for myself!"
3,"It's pretty, but..","I received my order today, and I was so excited that I rushed into the bathroom to try on the earcuff. But there's a problem. The earcuffs (not one out of the three I bought) fit. Not one. Perplexed, I looked up instructions on how to put them on, in case I was doing it wrong, you know? But I was putting it on right. Its a fuss putting on this one and the little one with the feather, and both of them are too small so they pinch and squeeze the sides of my ear. I guess Sabrina Silver doesn't understand that ever individual ear is different. How disappointing..."
3,Short Disk with Odd Mix - Collector Stuff,"Before Bob Calvert passed away from an unspecified show-biz related ailment he earned a few fans; and there are two cuts for them on this disk: 'The Right Stuff' and 'Ejection'. Also included is a Nik Turner solo-effort: 'The Weighing of the Heart and Negative confession'. Dave Brock does not play on the preceeding songs; he does of course play on the single versions of: 'Lord of Light', 'Seven by Seven' ('Silver Machine' B-side), 'Paradox', and 'You'd Better Believe It'. 'Lord of Light' is culled from the 'Space Ritual' tour at the ""Mamouth Space Ritual"". The disk is fairly well mastered, but is only 35 minutes long."
3,The unknown,"excellent band that was lost through the cracks, saw themat sheppard air force base in texas 1983-84 , it was very cold up there i remember that . this will be gone soon so buy it."
5,Great music for those into upbeat tribal trance,"I got goosebumps from ""shaman's prayer"" when I first heard it . This is the only mellow track on the c.d. The rest transends into fast upbeat trance music with tribal overtones . My favorite track is ""siouxpernature"". I had never heard of medicine drum until I saw this in the store . I bought it on a hunch and I must must say this exceeded my expectations . For those into trance with a little bit of a tribal vibe I highly recommend this album."
3,"Not for ""Small Folk""",We purchased this book for our grandson who has a huge interst in Volkswagens. The book was very academic and not at all appropriate for a young person. The history part was very comprehensive. We returned our purchase.
3,Too corporate,"I loved Volkswagens ever since I was a lad of twelve, and so had a natural interest in this book. It starts off well enough - the story about the car's development in Nazi Germany was fascinating - but I soon tired of the excessively corporate style in the later years (details about various VW executives and their industrial philosophies) and didn't bother to finish it.They used to give these out when you bought a Bug in the 1960's."
2,alright..,"i bought this crimper when i was in about 7th grade for the waver. it looked good, but it took a really long time. after awhile i started using the straightner, because my hair had always been wavy. this is a pretty good strightner if your hair is just a little wavy. i wouldnt suggest it to anybody with course curly hair. the flocked plate, which is supposed to make your hair shiny, does not work. the micro crimp plate works. overall i give this product 5/10"
4,Very Good,"This product is very good, especially if your tired and bored of not having anything else to do with your hair. You can straighten and crimp it. The only bad thing about it is that it makes your hair dry. I still recommend it-just don't use it too much!"
1,DON'T BUY,I had this straighter for a long time now and its making me really mad. It takes two hours to make my hair look sorta straight and thats after i go over every peice of hair about 5 times. I wish i could give this 0 stars...And it doesnt even deserve that much. it made my hair look horrible almost every time i used it and now i have to spend more money to buy a decent straighter. so dont buy this unless u plan on giving it to someone u really hate to get them mad and agravated when they try using it. I only used the crimp once and it made me look like....a poodle i guess. a poodle with a really bad perm....so yeah. use ur money and buy something useful. like supplies to make a sign. a sign that says how horrible this product is...and stand outdie a conair building with it. cuz they deserve it for making me so mad. lol.
1,NEVER EVER Buy This Product it sucks!,"my best friend got it because her hair is always frizzy and she saw what my flat iron did to my hair(I have TOTALLY CURLY HAIR, frizzy too and she has straight hair) but of course beauty is pain and...MONEY! because I bought a Chi iron (100 bucks so well spent) Ive had it for about 2 years I think and every time I flat iron its as good as the first but anyway she bought it and it did NOTHING!! she pushed it down as hard as she could to make it straighten and NOTHING! now shes 20 bucks short and has frizzy hair! if you ask me by the time you keep buying these things that dont work it will add up to 100 dollars just by a chi and save time energy and frustration! IF I COULD ID RATE THIS 0!-Stephanie"
1,Not what I expected,"The product I received, was not the product in the picture (twice).I ordered this because in the picture it shows the blue flocked plates, which I like using because my hair is baby fine & burns easily. However, I received the set that has the star plate instead. I sent it back thinking it was a mistake, but when they sent the replacement, it was the wrong set again! I guess they don't have the one I want, even though they are showing it in the picture. I have told them to change the picture...but obviously they don't listen to feedback."
2,false information,"this item was nicely presented, however it's not as good as it appears in the info page, heat is low, styling is bad, it's bad by all means"
1,not a good item,I got this item hopeing my hair would be straight for once and i used it and it wasnt straight even one bit.Dont buy this because you will waste your money!
1,"OLD SCHOOL ""FLAT IRON"" does NOT work well! sold at garage sale for $1.50","this thing is so old school i'm surprised the instructions don't say to heat it on an open flame with your ""supper,"" a la little house on the prairie!! it takes FOREVER to heat up, and only the tiny crimpy attachment works. i sold this a couple of months ago at our garage sale, the lady wouldnt give me TWO bucks for it! when you check the wattage/voltage on this compared to my current flat iron (Revlon 20 dollar cheapie from target) it is like, then times less power. dont waste your time AND/OR money on this studebaker of hair accesories!"
1,Useless,I had to use all my power to squeeze to get any result and my hair is easy to style. Just not worth trying it
2,Not hot enough,"The idea and concept behind this product is good, it would save space in any bathroom. The only problem is that it does not get hot enough to straighten, crimp or wave hair."
2,They still make these?,Holy crow. I had this back in middle school. Mine was purple. Wow i was thinking about this yesterday with my mom. I also remembered that it took FOREVER to heat up and it didnt work properly well at least the waver and the other thing. The only one that worked was the straightner and even that didnt do a very good job.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!,"This was one of the first flat irons I had ever used, and it almost made me never want to flat iron my hair again. This product is absolute garbage. First of all, you have to go over your hair about 5 times for it to even make the slightest change in your hair. With every stroke, your hair is getting ripped out. I would have to stop and take strands of hair out from between the plate and the handle. It was horrible. It is also very heavy and bulky. Save yourself the headache and buy a different flat iron. Conair has OK products, but their flat irons are pathetic. I would go with another brand all together."
1,Worthless product,"I thought since it was a Conair product this would be a good product, boy I was wrong. My daughters hair is not all that thick and it wouldnt even hold a crimp even though we used a good hair product to hold the crimp. I also tried it on my hair and still didnt work well. The plates are to thin and it doesnt even get very hot. If anyone else can recommend a good crimping iron please let me know."
3,Conair 3 and 1,"This product wasnt as easy as I thought it would be and it doesn't straighten very well the crimper wouldnt crimp my hair, but did do the job for my youngest daughter"
1,Just Say No!!!,"Bought this at walmart for 17 bucks and it sucks!! This is not for thick wavy frizzy hard to straighten hair. Even when i straightened my hair with another flat iron and went to use the crimping plates it still sucked, This is horrible don't waste your money!!!!"
2,this sucks,"To be honest, this Conair styling kit isn't useful at all. I bought this couple years before. It worked well with straightening but it always makes my hair frizzy. Later, I bought a Wigo flat iron then that broke and now I have the Conair CS19CS/CS19QCS Instant Heat Ceramic Hair Straightener. That hair straigtener is good, you can go see my review there if you want. I give this product 2 stars because besides the awful results of the straightener part, the waver and crimp are pretty good."
2,Only good for crimping,"Ah how sad when I begged my mom for a hair straightner and she cheaped out on me and bought me this 10 years ago. The straightner does not work at all, I have no idea what the velvet pads are for? And I didn't care much for the large waver. However I fell in love with the crimper and for a long time that was my look. My hair being so thick it took FOREVER to do just the top layer (never do your whole head) and at least it didn't do any damage, although I'm pretty sure it damaged anyone else's hair that tried it. I'm looking for a good mini crimper to replace this one, something that can do the job fast, have the same cute look and you don't have to SQUEEZE so very hard to get results."
2,Not what I expected,"I have others that I use, thought this would be a great addition, however, does not do what I expected it to."
2,OK,The wave and the crimper did not work well at all....the straightener is ok but the other attachments were not worth it.
1,"Cool enough to touch, not hot enough to work.","--------| Pros |--------- Good design/idea with the switchable plates- Cuts down on storage space needed--------| Cons |--------- Functionally useless- Does NOT get hot enough- Takes a long time (20+ min) to heat up- Straightened/styled lasts hair for ~10 minI've been using heat styling tools for years and have had multiple different straighteners over the years, Conair, generic brands, Revlon... and this one is the worst one I've ever used. My hair texture is thin, fine and wavy, i.e. extremely easy to straighten. This is the only straightener I've ever used that 1) cannot straighten my hair and 2) whose result does not last against humidity."
3,A Western with a difference,"This book is a surprisingly effective adventure in the Oklahoma Territory in the late 19th century, in which a young girl hires an old marshal to hunt down the killer of her father. Told in the first person, quite believable and exciting, a colloquial narrative that works. It has been made into a movie twice, proving its durability as a classic horse opera."
3,"don't be put off by the ""western"" classification","The story is told from the viewpoint of Mattie Ross, a 39 year old ""spinster"", spinning the tale of her one big adventure at age 14. Mattie's father was shot down in cold blood, and as the oldest child, she feels she needs to make sure his death was not in vain. Once she realizes the authorities have no interest in pursuing his murderer, she hires a U.S. Marshal of questionable character to help track him down and bring him to justice. ""Justice"" she clarifies could come through the courts or at the end of her dead father's revolver.Mattie is a tough and courageous young girl, but occasionally the veneer will crack and you remember she is still just a child. Rooster Cogburn realized that she was not as tough as she led on and it warmed his hardened heart. He went from being annoyed at her presence to her protector.My verdict: Read it. It is actually a sweet story and not nearly as ""western"" as I feared it would be."
4,A western that's genuinely funny,"After watching the thoroughly okay Cohen brothers film, I was surprised at just how much I came to enjoy the book itself. Portis is really good at creating lively, funny characters across the whole length of the good guy/bad guy spectrum. And he does almost all of it with a wonderfully anachronistic style of dialogue which instead of feeling stuffy and formal, conveys just what a weird cultural polyglot the American frontier was in the late 19th century. A place of christianized Indians, murderous rogues, crusty civil war vets, displaced European immigrants, what have you. It's the old weird America, rendered all the funkier by the fact that its narrated by a 14 year old girl fanatically obsessed with a revenge killing. It's easy for westerns to be bleak and maudlin. Portis manages to make his not only funny, but genuinely charming."
5,Not even finished and it is an all time favorite,"I love novels with first person narrators, and this one Miss Mattie Ross, is really a firecracker. She is Lisbeth Salander, and the girl from the movie Kickass wrapped in one 14 year old girl from America's frontier days, the West. The book is hilarious, and her sharp as nails no nonsense lines and delivery is truly outstanding. The strength of the narrator's voice reminds me of Holden Caulfield and Huck Finn. What a pleasure. In fact, I think i will dive back to Fort Smith, Arkansas, and see what's going on..."
5,Love It,"Excellent book, it's on my favorite list (which considering my personal library size, is saying something). A story of justice, courage, friendship and human nature. The book is an inspiration to anyone who's experienced something similar to Mattie's heartbreak. It's a quick read but packed with tons of emotion, adventure, moments of comic relief, and as the title suggests, grit. Upon finishing it, I wanted to just read it straight through again."
3,good read,"Good book. I read a lot and a friend said it was good, so I got it. It gave me a different feel that the movie with John Wayne in that His character was not the John Wayne type in my opinion. I am glad I read it."
4,I Read Cover to Cover,"True Grit is an adventure story told in a plain style.I sat down on a flight from Louisville to Los Angeles and spent an extra hour and a half finishing the book on a bench at LAX.This is one of those instances where I do not want to ruin the book by seeing the movie,I recommend this book."
5,The great American novel,"This could be the elusive great American novel. It has all the necessary American elements: revenge, truth-seeking, violence, travel, sanctimoniousness, evasiveness, authority questioning, etc. Portis is a treasure -- at times funny, never long-winded, sharer of deep themes. Within True Grit, he has created iconic American literary figures with Maddie and Rooster Cogburn. It is a book that plays on so many levels and is satisfying in so many ways: you have a young, female protagonist; two mentors who represent variations on truth and approaches to life; it's a page-turner full of action; and it is written in a style that can be described as literary. Small wonder it continues to be read -- and rediscovered -- decades after its issuance."
5,Truly Great,"I have never read ""True Grit"" until now. I was prompted when I read an interview with the Coen brothers and they remarked that they had wanted to remain faithful to the book in their re-make of the movie. So, I decided to read the book before I saw the movie. This is a very entertaining read. Most people reading this probably know the basic plot lines. Mattie Ross,14, enlists the help of US Marshall Rueben ""Rooster"" Cogburn to help her track down her father's killer, Tom Chaney. The narrative voice of Mattie Ross is so distinctive that it rings in my head the way Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch's did in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and Huck Finn's did in the ""Th Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"". This is a quick, delightful read that I will recommend to everyone. I plan to read much more Charles Portis."
4,Impressive Western,"Mattie Ross, a precocious fourteen-year-old Arkansas girl, is the unintentionally hilarious narrator of this classic western story. She badgers Deputy Marshall Rooster Cogburn and Texas Ranger La Beouf into allowing her to accompany them into Indian Territory to pursue the man who murdered her father.However unreliable a narrator Mattie may be (that is up to the reader to decide), it is a cracking good tale full of gun fights, desperados and bandits of all descriptions - I don't see how the movie can possibly compare."
4,Matty's Grit (sorry they make you write a title),"There is something about True Grit that invites readers to embrace a classic type of storytelling. By having a tough, opinionate and yet naive Matty narrating the story, Portis creates an adventure that really resonates as a story your mum or grandmother would tell you about their youth. Cogburn isn't so much a hero as a man whose ""grit"" is survival. It's amazing how little it takes for Portis to create such a singular character. All the interactions have a freshness that made me forget this novel was written before I was born. People are what they are. Best scene is a rapid fire exchange between Matty and Stonehill over horses and money. I wish I negotiated so well.Some people have complained about $9.99 for a 224 page book. Frankly, the money isn't important if the story is so good the reader will revisit it again."
3,True Grit wasn't what I expected...,"It's a decent book but writing in the first person seems very limiting. It is average for what I expected. I thought that it was going to be more than what I got. Perhaps I just had unrealistic expectations. It's a light read that you can finish quickly and gives you a different perspective since Mattie Ross is the one narrating. Lonesome Dove it is not, though."
4,Great Book!!,After seeing the 2nd remake of the movie I thought it should be time to read the book that inspired it. Great on all fronts as has been stated for ages!This copy was in much better shape than advertised and a bargain buy!!
3,Entertaing... but elementary,"I enjoyed this book, don't get me wrong. It was witty. Not a nail biter, as I thought it would be. And it did not seem much of a westerner. It lacked a lot of suspense (though there were good climatic points). The writing seemed elementary (as I imagine it was supposed to). I would definitely recommend this for a young adult, or as an easy read for an adult!"
3,"ok, but not among the better books out there.","I was a 14 year old girl when I read this story, and I was continually annoyed with the portrayal of Mattie. While she was supposed to be some sort of hero, I found she was usually a bit bossy and no more spectacular than any girl I knew. The ""grit"" didn't show through, in my opinion. Her insistence on going along for the ""hunt"" seemed childish to me. Nonetheless, it's easy to read, and a passable story. Maybe a bit hung up on revenge, and with some unrealistic scenes, but not bad, overall. [Of the 3 books I had to read that summer, it was the most entertaining, but the other two were Grapes of Wrath and Native Son, so that's no surprise.]"
1,Not as Shown,"The book pictured appears to be a hardcover with dust jacket, red in color. In fact what is sent is a hardcover, WITHOUT a dust jacket, with a BLACK cover. The quality of the paper used in the book as well leaves a lot to be desired. I am probably going to return it, as it is definitely not wortb the price. For twenty nine bucks, I would expect to get a dust jacket."
1,True Grit,"Too darned expensive on kindle. Much less at the book store. Yes, the Kindle is great, but I can't waste money like that."
4,I'll admit it I watched the movie first,"As the title implies I watched both film versions before I read the book. And with that being said I can now say that I loved this novel. I don't read westerns very often, in fact I've only ever read Lonesome Dove before this novel; however, I couldn't put this book down. Portis's sense of pacing is engaging and his heroine is a fascinating character. Not a single character is without grit and yet each remains a distinct and fully realized individual. It is a testament to his talent as a writer that he manages to create such tough individuals without making one character look weak or helpless. I have only one suggestion. Wait some time between watching the Coen brothers' movie and reading this book. They follow the plot and the dialog almost exactly."
4,Strong woman,"I am a Japanese, adicted by Western Movies, to such an extent to visit Arizona to see the scienery of Western movies, but never had a chance to visit Montana,although I once visited Alamo in TEXAS. The women movie stars played with John Wein are always pretty and affable but strong at bottom, but this girl of this book seems too strong for me to cope with"
4,Interesting prose,"I was a little surprised at the writing style of Charles Porter in True Grit. It is a bit more cut and dry than I was expecting, yet it was a pleasurable read and I feel a good perspective of the time it depicts."
5,A Novel That Is Well Worth The Time To Read,"Rarely do I read novels....most of what I read is nonfiction. I made an exception to the rule, as I had seen the movies and wanted to read the book to see if it could be better than the movies. In my humble opinion, it's a draw. Both the movies and the book are excellent and well worth the time to read/watch! Enjoy!"
2,Colors faded quickly,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday. The product arrived quickly and looked beautiful. However, after only a couple of months driving (we received this in July), the color started to fade and now it is hard to make out what the label is."
4,songs with sexuality,"Much as I like to newer Jazz chantueses, Diana Krall, Cassandra Wilson, Jane Monheit, Patricia Barber, they really can't hold a candle to Julie London. He voice oozes pure, hot, sticky .... She makes you feel the blues.Yeah, I'd like to hear her with a smaller combo, but this is a great album with a large orchestra. Some clever songs I'd never heard before.And a good price too."
5,Sultry Siren of Jazz,"I bought this cd for my mother for her birthday, myself born in 81' having no idea who Julie London is usually listen to heavy metal but I do like a little blues and jazz but don't know much about it other than the stuff from the 50's and 60's usually sounded better than the new r&b mix fluff, after hearing this cd I was amazed it's kinda like everything I ever looked for in jazz albums but never heard, so I'm buying a copy for myself now and probably some more Julie London cd's soon."
3,disappointed,not one of their best cds on a par with songs from the grass strings ranch wish they had stayed like their earlier music eg-dumas walker
4,HEAD HUNTER`S ARE FLYING HIGHT !!!,Flying under the radar is a vary good cd. at a low price you can`t let go.!!. I gave this cd 4 star`s i like (big boss man)and (midnight special).thy got a new singer but it still has that rock country sound mybe a little more harder sound then be for. So if you Like a country song whith a lot of KICK!!!. THIS IS IT!!. Thank you.
3,"Cute, but not sturdy enough","I bought one of these for a friend who has a 3 year old daughter. She loved it, but unfortunately before they could even use it on their big upcoming trip, it broke. The plastic loop on the trunki that connects the strap broke off. Quite a disappointment."
2,Pink Trunki,Locks on this come off easily. Locks are hard for parents and kids to open. Great idea if easier to open. Purchased for 5 and 3 year old for a plane trip.
5,"fun ""kitchy"" suitcase","My neice(3 yrs) loves this gift. We bought the blue one for our daughter and both she and her 4 1/2 year old brother love it too (probably because it's blue, but it's bright enough to keep his pink-loving sister happy). They load it up with their Webkinz and drag it all over the house. We plan to use it more as a novelty on our trips as a carry on for the portable dvd and kids activities to keep us busy on longer flights. Every young child who has come in the door gets right on and it is quite a hit."
1,The green cover,"I was the designer for that release, the original artwork was lost. No it is't a bootleg, Cleopatra had to re-release it.Carl Edwards"
4,exploited,"this cd isn't that bad. other then the first song there really aren't too many songs that stick out, but oh well"
3,not as good as i hoped,i was hoping this cd was going to be a little better then it is. maybe it'll grow on me.all the songs sound the same and bad sound quality because its live. so
5,Perfect book for a beginner!,This is a fun book to read... it is very easy to follow. The illustrations make it simple enough for the beginner interested in learning basic massage techniques.
4,Good read for the layperson,"I had hoped this book would help me as a professional, as in something I could keep on my shelf as a reference or get some new ideas from, but its mostly geared for the layperson with no training trying to learn massage for the first time.If that is you, get this book, its great!If you have a massage license already, don't waste your time or money. Its just basic Swedish that you should (hopefully) know already... unless for some reason you're interested in the chaper on how to get erotic on the massage table. Though, if you're a professional, lets hope not.All in all, its not a bad read, I just don't understand why everyone hyped it up so much on here."
5,The Massage Book will never be out-moded!,The Massage Book was one of the first books about massage I read when I became interested in the therapeutic effects of touch. I still refer to it frequently in my massage practice. I highly recommend it as a guide for massage for family and friends. I'm buying it for students in my informal massage class!
3,"Pretty good...not a fan of the illustrations, though","I'm of mixed opinions about this book, but it may only be that my personal preference makes me biased. I truly did get quite a bit out of the written explanations, but feel that the hand-drawn illustrations leave a bit to be desired. This was the first book of massage that I purchased, (I'm merely an amateur, but I'm very interested in the subject) I've since bought many other books that I feel were much more helpful, simply because they combined equally good written explanations with full color photos, which I feel convey the author's meaning much more clearly. However, this may be purely my own aesthetic taste, as the written work is still very good."
5,True R&B,"If you want to hear a really nice compilation of real singing really nyce (i meant that) lyrics and all around quality music...BUY this CD. I couldn't wait to hear this CD so I ""Close(d) My Eyes"" and began to ""Breathe Again"" so I could really ""Feel It."" It took ""Some"" time but ""Ooh Wee"" this CD was ""Calling My Name!"" Each time I listen to it ""I Fall So Deep."" Now I'm just waiting for REN to ""Come Around My Way"" so we can ""Build Our House"" on a solid foundation! PEACE AND MUCH LOVE AND GOODWILL TO REN!"
2,Waiting for it to break,"CONS:-As many have commented, the readout doesnt work (displays random numbers).-The 'tension' knob is really a step 'height' adjustment that just unscrews itself every few minutes of use, and the steps keep lowering. To keep it in place I wrapped a piece of gaffers tape tightly around the knob and the mid-bar.-The foam hand grips leave an unpleasant smell on my hands that does not wash off easily, so I wrapped them in rag strips.-I had a slightly cheaper model previously and the cable snapped after about a year. Several comments here complain of the same happening to this model. Will see how long this one lasts.PROS:-Its good because it stashes away under a coffee table and I can pull it out to use while watching TV instead of vegging, or take it on the porch and get a little sun."
3,Part missing,"In all other ways a great stepper, but came without the little monitor that sticks out of the top."
3,customer service,"VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE WHEN YOU NEED PARTS. I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR OVER THREE WEEKS FOR A PART, EVERY TIME I CALL I WAS TOLD TO CALL NEXT WEEK. AS OF THIS REVIEW I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVE MY PART, I HAD TO ORDER A NEW STEPPER FORM A COMPANY IN CAL, THIS NEW STEPPER COST ME MORE THAN I PAID FOR THE STEPPER FROM STAMMINA, TWICE AS MUCH. I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER STEPPER FROM THIS CO. THE CS REP IS VERY ARGON WHEN YOU KEEP CALLING AS THEY REQUESTED YOU TO DO SO. THANK YOU ERNEST"
4,Great Buy,"I received this product quickly and I assembled it in 1 minute. It works great! It's easy to move around and it doesn't take up alot of space. Like other reviews say, it does squeek once you start using it for a couple of minutes. But it's not that loud and i don't even notice it after a few minutes. Also it is pretty stiff for the first 20 steps or so everytime you use it. It seems it has to warm up. But i have absolutly no problem with that. I think this product was a great buy!"
4,Work out Starter,"This Stair Climber is Great. it is on the Bulky side but if you are trying to get started on an exercise plan, this is a great start. You have the ability to work out of the comfort of your own home and work out in front of the TV if you want to. I love it"
1,broke down,"I ordered ""Stamina InStride Electronic Stepper"" last month.It has been only one month since I got it.But, yesterday when I used it,its steel wire rope snapped suddenly ! This stepper broke down!"
2,I loved it until...,"It broke. Twice. The first one I sent back. Customer service was good, delivery of a new item was prompt, which is why this gets two stars instead of one from me. It broke a second time, however, and I give up. The first time the piston part got stuck and impeded the stepping motion. The second time the cord that goes around the rotary disc broke. Argh!"
2,bad luck with the stepper,"I loved my stepper for about two months - it's small and compact, the workout was great - and then it broke. I then ordered a replacement part, which came in worse condition than the one I was replacing. My stepper was fantastic when it worked but I seem to be having bad luck with it.One other small problem - it squeaked quite loudly."
2,Squeaky,"After only a few uses, the shocks on the machine started squeaking. After a few more uses, the stepper pads started to squeak. Then the tension pully started to squeak. Then the hinges started to squeak. I'm not a heavy gal so it's not due to the weight of the user -- heaven help you if you're over 110lb because I can only imagine the noises this thing will make! The mechanism works fine and is a decent workout but the high-pitched squealing will drive you crazy after a while."
1,Disk broke half!!!!!,I have been using this for 3 month already and I was happy with it.This stepper is not quiet and can not change the level.The big problem is there is a disk in the middle of the item and just broke in half.So do not waste you money!!!!
3,somewhat disappointing,"The problem with this item is two-fold. First, it heats up quite a bit and as it heat up offers less resistance, so it is not like a large stepper which maintains a steady resistance. Secondly, the angle changes - look at the picture - when you are up, your toe is down, and when you're down, your toe is up. This is hard on your ankles after time. So sad to say, this was not a good solution for us, as enticing as the price was, it was not worth it."
2,poor design,"Poorly designed, there is a metal strap that connects the foot pads together. I broke 5 of them in the 90 warranty period. I give them 2 stars, one because it is good exercise if you get to use it, and one because they did send the replacement parts quickly. I had to wait a month for the first replacement, but then usually only about the week for each of the others. They told me it was ""not designed for a dedicated athlete like myself"". What a crock. If you are looking for a decorative piece to sit in the corner this will probably do. But if you actually want to get some exercise I would look elsewhere. It seems to be a recurring theme with this company, look at reviews of some other products they sell."
3,Broken after not quite a year,"Although the stepper is a little noisy, it worked fine until the metal cross bar that provides tension for the pedals broke.It's an inexpensive product, and you get what you pay for."
4,"small, sturdy, good workout","The primary problem with this product is that it does squeak, but this problem can be solved with WD-40 or other lubricant.So far, the product has been sturdy, reliable, and dependable. It will give you a good cardio work-out if you can get to exercising on it fast. The electronic meter is also nice as it estimates calories burned, time spent on the machine for the current session, number of steps, and a few other things.Pros: Reasonable price, good work-out, convenient to have in homeCons: wish it had some upper body component, squeaky at times"
3,Great for the price,"I only use it as a back-up to when I can't go for a walk outside. For that purpose, it's good enough. It doesn't take up space and is easy to use. It is squeaky like some other users mentioned, but it doesn't bother me too much as I had tv or music on loud enough to cover it up. The only thing is that it doesn't have varying resistance, so if you don't weigh much, it's quite a bit of effort to step on it. I weigh about 92 and it's hard to get it going. For my husband who weighs 145, it's much easier."
4,good buy,"Easy to use and store, works as advertised. The only thing I wish would be different would be the ability to adjust the tension on the shocks - they are very stiff until the get warmed up."
1,Cable broke twice,"Like many of the reviews, recieving Stamina products such as this stepper appear to be a good product for price and value...and they work in the beginning!! However the parts are either defective or poor quality materials...the wire around the cable eventually wears....it needs to be better quality....with the replacement parts and shipping costs you might be better off spending more on your initial investment for a better quality product....Stamina....LISTEN to your customers!!!!"
3,Works well enough for the price,"It is a stable and sturdy device that does not tip over even if a heavy person loses balance while using it. The stepper is very easy to assemble - only the display and belt need to be attached. The display is sort of small and hard to see from the top unless you exercise in a well lit area. This mini-stepper does not allow you to adjust stepping difficulty level, you just take bigger or smaller (really it's deeper or more shallow) steps. Really small, low-intensity steps, that barely push the pedal down are not counted as steps by the machine. All in all it is a reasonable quality for the low price, and combined with dumbells or a stretch band makes for a decent workout."
1,great idea poor design,"First hat's off to amazon for great customer service. we first purchased this product in summer 09 i used it sparingly but then my son started to use it. He used it almost everyday for about 20- 40 minutes each session. after a few months it started to have a loud ""rubbing"" sound which we couldn't fix. then the right piston failed. i called the company and they said it was past warranty. i called amazon and they were great said they would ship me out a new one asap. we recv'd the new one in a couple days and shipped back the defective one. my son started using it and within 2 weeks the machine created a foul smell when used. then a couple weeks later it started leaking oil from the piston.this machine is only suited for VERY light use. the concept is great and when it works it's a great machine. I wished the manufacturer spent a little more money for better pistons it would be a winner then . but 2 failures for 2 machines is unacceptableI would NOT recommend this product"
1,Design Needs Improvement,"I used it daily for a month and found it good for burning calories. The noise is a little irritating and then the cable broke. I ordered a replacement cabl, installed it myself and three weeks later it broke again. I'm looking for something more durable. This would be a great if the manufacturer would correct the design defects."
1,my wire broke too - got new wire - broke again!,"Double whammy. My wire broke too like other people. They were nice enough to send another free wire which was great, but the wire broke again after about 2 months of use both times. I weigh under 180 pounds. After reading all the similar reviews it seems this product needs to get a new design with a stronger wire. Until this gets sturdier, I wouldn't waste your money for this poorly designed equipment."
1,IT BROKE TWICE!!!,"This product is not worth the savings at all. I weigh 215 lbs. and it says it has a limit of 250 lbs. NOT AT ALL, it broke twice. The cable around the wheel snapped both times. Each stepper only lasted about two weeks. Stear clear of this product at all costs. The only good thing about this experience is Amazon did replace it fast, the second time I gave up on this machine and sent for a refund."
4,Nice LITTLE stepper,I am enjoying my stepper but originally it was purchased with my husband planning on using it as well. He will not be able to use it. The foot peddle is adaquate for my feet (woman's size 9.5-10) but his feet do not fit safely so he will not be using it. Full disclosure -- he wears men's 13. The peddles are 10.5 inches from the very tip top of the curved front to the back edge. Hope this helps in your decision making.
3,Stamina stepper,It does the job! But it is so hard and heavy that it kind discourages you to exercise. I would preferred something lighter and easy to use/move.
4,Pretty good,"I like the Stamina Stepper, it gets my heart rate going right away. I like how it's compact and sturdy. The only minor downside about this machine is it makes some noise."
1,Disappointed,"Bought this 6 months ago and it now is leaking black fluid which smells like rubber burning. I can't contact anyone to replace the item on Amazon website, because there is no link to do so. Really disappointed in the quality of this product. I would certainly like a replacement."
3,"So Far, No Good!","Well, I've been using it for two weeks, 30 minutes/day, and it hasn't broken. I'm worried it will, because of other reviewers and because I weigh in at 250lbs, which is the machine's maximum. If it breaks, I'll update this review, otherwise I'm having a great time!(please don't break!)UPDATE!Yeah, it broke. Specifically, the chain on it snapped (after making some loud popping sounds). To conclude, if you weight as much as me, you might only get two and a half weeks out of this thing. It's a hell of a good, low impact workout, but I think I'll wait until Instride makes some improvements before buying it, again. As of now, jogging seems to be working, but it usually puts too much strain on my joints. Sigh.Anyway,Cheers!"
3,Not what I was expecting..,"Being a fan of Ryan Scully's other ventures, I figured that Id like this album. Cliched comparisons would be; The Clash meets early Red Hot Chili Peppers, or; some form of New Orleans Ska. That might sound cool, but it didnt work for me. At least I only paid a penny for the CD."
1,don't waste your money,I memorized every question in this book--not one of them was on the test.Save your money
4,Confidence Booster,"I bought this book and studied it for about three months before taking the exam. I really liked how the book broke the test down into manageable parts. The practice tests at the end of each section were helpful. This is a good resource because it hit on the high points regarding memory/recall types of questions, but more focus on processing scenarios could have been more helpful. Anyway, I did pass. If I had to do it all over again, I would probably only buy this book. I have recommended it to peers. After reading through it several times, I felt confident going into the exam, which I think was half the battle of passing the LMSW."
4,Good Study Tool,"I read through the study guide about three times, took all the practice tests, and passed my exam on the first try! Although the study guide presented a variety of in-depth information, much of it was not on the exam. I found the most helpful part to be the test-taking tips. Overall, I was satisfied with this purchase."
2,Horrible sample questions,"This book has some useful BASIC information. But I really disagree with the way some of the theories are categorized (i.e. what is in the Psychodynamic/Relational group) and some huge chunks that are missing - Attachment Theory, Transactional Analysis. Also, I think the practice questions are inconsistent and not like the ones on the actual ASWB test at all. Sometimes this book prioritizes safety, other times client confidentiality - it is all over the map. And the questions are just really poorly written. There are lots of questions that refer to concepts not covered in their own study guide!! So frustrating. Definitely overpriced. You are better off looking at notes from Grad School and a couple of the suggested text books."
4,LSW EXAM PREPARATION,The book has been helpful with giving me relevant information about how the questions will be formed on the exam.
2,This is a tester you!,If you have never put together anything or if your kid is interested in model kits. This a good way to see if you or your child is ready to build. When it comes to gundams my favorite size is 1/100 the detail is great and constructing is fun. 1/144 will leave you wanting more and also break easily. This item is great for stocking stuffers or additional small gifts.
5,Amazing Product! Amazing Results!,"My daughter had bad plantars warts all over her feet. Because of her fear of having them ""removed"", we tried all kinds of OTC remedies as well as all of the home remedies we've heard about. Nothing worked. In fact, they just kept spreading and were so painful she was having trouble walking. We finally broke down and went to the pediatrician. To my surprise he recommended Occlusal-HP. Something I've never heard of before. I looked in every store and made tons of phone calls. I couldn't find it anywhere. Online seems to be the only place you can get it. And if I'm being honest, I wasn't crazy about the price. But we were desperate. I'm happy to say that she is wart-free, thanks to this product. It was the ONLY thing that worked without having to resort to painful freeze treatments. Totally worth the money!"
3,This book was ok,i rented this book from the library in hopes of it toping the other strange matter books i have read.sadly it wasnt as good.the plot was ok but there were not as many twists as there were in otehr SM books.this series is WAY better than goosebumps and i wish marty&johnny kept it up its too bad they went out of buisness.if anyone out there has any strange matter books for sale please contact me(especially the srange forces books # 2&3(the ones with rilo and the kids)) at jhalbee@snet.net jon
1,TOTAL GARBAGE!!,"This is a rip off - DO NOT BUY IT!! It is total garbage! This is a cheesy decal stuck on cheap, particle board material. The cent is not a mirror, but rather a cheap piece of plastic. When it arrived the decal was coming off, a corner of the cheap wood material was broken, and when I unwrapped it, the cheap plastic piece in the center fell off. TOTAL GARBAGE - BEWARE!"
3,"This book lists several types of Kahunas, and tells legends","This book only tells of a subset of types of kahuna, and tells a few legends.Kahuna means keeper of the secret. There were prayer kahunas, kahuna aloha that practised love magic, kahunas that built houses, kahunas that made canoes, kahunas that were expert farmers, etc.This 76 page book lists several types of kahunas, and relates the legends of some kahunas. However; this book is extremely shallow, and does not relate the spiritual beliefs or practises of the Hawaiian kahunas.Either ""Hawaiian Magic and Spirituality"" by Scott Cuunninghan would give you a more complete list of the types of kahunas, and some of the spiritual beliefs as well.Please E-Mail me if you have questions or comments; Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
5,The Kahuna,Book was in good condition but didn't have the cover that was advertised. Other than that the book was what I wanted. Will order from them again.
3,Never Delivered,"This is the product I wanted - it was the ideal form factor.Unfortunately, it was out of stock with no delivery date. I am hung in limbo - it shows that it was ""picked requested"" for shipment, but never picked up - nor charged. Yet I can't cancel it.Oh well, I bought a D-Link."
1,Sounded good but didn't work for me either...,"I tried using the acid products several times without success, so I was really hopeful about the effectiveness of this product. I thought it was similar to the liquid nitrogen applications you can get in a doctor's office. Unfortunately it didn't quite do much for me. Even though I applied it 3 times for the maximum time recommended (40s), it didn't hurt much at all and didn't blister, so the warts are still there... It doesn't seem like any over the counter products are effective for plantar warts!"
4,COOL,I REALLY LIKED THE CD. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS I COULDENT GET THE LYRCS. SOME OF THE WORDS I WOULDENT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND SO I COULD NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND THE SONG.OTHER THAN THAT THE CD HAD A GOOD SOUND TO IT. IF YOU LIKE HARD MUSIC I RECOMEND YOU BUY THISE CD.
1,The Worst Thing I Ever Bought,"I rarely write reviews. But this is the flimsiest POS I have ever purchased from Amazon. Don't accept this if it's free. I won't stand up right, won't fold back down right -- oh, and make sure you read the fine print on the box before you even open it, because it will burst out like the snakes in a can in the old practical joke, and quite possibly bust your face open.Never, ever buy this. In fact, I will never buy anything from this company again."
1,piece of c**p,"don't buy this!! side poles burst through the extremely cheap fabric (if this can be called fabric), the tent doesn't stand on its own, a waste of money at any price. it is such a disappointment to see my son want to play with it and its totally unsuitable construction for play. can't wait to throw it out!"
1,Not sturdy enough for children,"If I could give this item a half star I would and only because of the characters printed on it and not the tent itself. First of all, the tent is taller than it is wide which creates a physical problem for children who go rip-roaring through the openings- it falls over every time. Secondly, the item twists open but there are still extra poles you must add to it- even then there is no stability. Thirdly, the ""fabric"" reminds me of disposable tablecloth... its papery and could tear easily. There is a picture printed on only two sides of this tent- the only two sides visiable in the advertised picture. No matter what the cost is I would not puchase this item even if it was a dollar. Kids simply cannot play with it. Maybe if you are the creative type who can figure out a way to keep the four end corners grounded it would be worth it- Otherwise, pass by this item and don't look back."
2,Tacky Paint Chips and Peels Off,"This table is well made and perfect for 2 kiddos. However, when it arrived the red paint was still tacky. We assembled it anyways, hoping that it would dry hard. It's been a month now and the paint is still gummy. It scrapes off easily and if we leave dinner plates on it, they pick up some of the paint when we lift them up. Disappointed with the paint quality. Go with unpainted."
3,A time when Usherhouse was worth hearing,"Usherhouse comes through on this release. To me this was a time when they actually made decent music, as opposed to later material which seemed to lack the amount of heart put into this recording.All of the songs on this release are worth a listen. Upbeat and pretty dark.3 stars for their effort though I cant give more than that since its still not my ""cup of tea"" really..""The Line"" and ""Avalanche"" are two of the standouts."
3,"I'm not thrilled with it, but other people might like it","I love maternity clothes and think that the whole big belly thing is sort of cute, but when I wear this skirt I just feel fat. I think it is because to pull off maternity clothes you need to be able to show at least 1 part of your body that is still skinny. With dresses it is normally that area right under your bust. If you are wearing pants people can see that just your tummy is huge, and your legs are still normal. But with the skirt I felt like I was a big fat clown. However, it might work better for someone else. The skirt was well made, I did get some compliments on it from some acquaintances and it was a great price."
5,de-frazzling,No one could be as disorganized as I.Unfortunately most organizational books want you to change your modus-operandi.I have finally found one that will accept me as I am without making me change.I know I am a total slob but I want to be organized in accordance with what I am.Now I have some semblance of a chance.5 stars for giving me that chance.
4,Organizing for the Spirit,"A relaxing and informative read about bringing your life (back) into perspective.... Chock full of helpful strategies for realizing and achieving one's goals and finally, attaining fulfillment. I very much enjoyed it!!"
2,Professionals- Avoid this Book,"As a professional Organizer, I picked this book up for my collection, thinking that additions mean new ideas. This book was a waste of time and money. After reading the first few chapters, I was unimpressed by the ""one-size-fits-all"" technique as well as the author's use of derogatory terms to label ""Disorganization types"". Also, the use of 5 broad catagories to label someone is often misdirecting, and might cause some people to become MORE cluttered and disorganized in an attempt to fit a label they don't actually need. By the end of the book, I decided to write a review in hopes that others might avoid this book as a guide for conquering chronic disoranization.Unless you have only minimal clutter issues, I suggest avoiding this book."
2,could have been better,"I was looking for a lot more than what was given, I am still looking for a strong oragnization book"
1,not representative of either religion...,"This book was quite grim and weird.... the woman grows up in a bizarre version of a Christian cult... is terribly abused there... and by her family, who put her in the cult in the first place.. in fact her father helps create the cult. Her mother supports her father in all the craziness. It is supposed to be about a person ""finding"" Judaism... there is actually very little information about Judaism in it... mostly her suffering with the cult... it would read better as a depiction of abuse ... the Story of O without the sex.... If you want a book about religion(s), this is not it. The writing is not very good and I grew very impatient with the repetitive and recursive descriptions of how she tortures herself per cult instructions. You could give her brownie points for actually telling her story, but I'm not sure she has enough insight for that to count."
2,"little meat,alot of mush","If you are looking for a book which details the intellectual and rational search of a person for the soul's home in the Jewish faith, this is not the book to read. Coming from a cultic, dysfunctional Pentecostal family, the author is very emotional and seems to judge religious precepts purely on the basis of how they ""feel"". I don't doubt that she had a life-long feeling of inner-connectedness to Judiasm,but all one reads is how a woman exchanged a christian faith which controlled all her action for a jewish version of the same."
4,I Wanna Be A Paperback Writer,"Good journalism or good storytelling? There are times in this book when I suspected both. But what-the-hey, Mr. Kane was there and I wasn't so I'm in for the whole ride. The book definitely bridges the gap between factual reporting (which Mr. K undoubtedly was and is) and the fantasy we all share about complete access to celebrities at their peak. I often felt I knew Mr. K better than his subjects, so tightly woven is the fabric of this tale. Nonetheless, many excellent conversations illuminate the innocence of the period. How could anyone have truly known what The Beatles tours would do to change the course of entertainment? How can anyone imagine what the world would be like had there never been The Beatles and subsequent dual conquests of the States? These platforms alone are amazing foundations upon which to build this story. And the celebrated Mr. K superbly utilized his opportunity-of-a-lifetime."
3,A great view of the birth of Beatles fandom,"This book shines with Kane's anecdotes about events at -- and surrounding -- these early concerts. At most of the stops on the tour he recalls captivating tales of crazed fans, hasty and creative escapes by the Beatles, and the ways the band spent their time inbetween shows.Kane can be redundant at times, especially in the early parts of the book and with some of the descriptions of the other people traveling with him on the tour. In fact, I found the whole middle section of the book that describes his traveling press/management companions as a distraction. However, he gets back on track again at the end when he details his encounters on the 1965 tour.This is a fun and interesting book to read that will delight any level of Beatles fan. The CD is also fun to listen to, but doesn't have track numbers. So, if you lose your place, you have to fast-forward to the spot you last listened to."
2,Dateline meets the Beatles,"Kane had a wonderful opportunity when he traveled with the Beatles during those early tours. This book certainly gives some interesting highlights of how hectic those days were, but the style of his writing diminishes the work to the level of a Stone Phillips report on NBC. There's way too much foreshadowing, giving it the feel of ""When we get back from this commercial, you'll hear how the one of the Beatles made an anti-semitic remark...""Yes, as one reviewer put it, you'll see how the boys were actually nice, regular people, but Kane writes with an ineptitude typical of our televised society. Or else he doesn't have the story he thinks. And yes, the enclosed cd consists largely of John, Paul, George, and Ringo saying, ""Hello, Larry.""Some interesting tidbits for a Beatle afficionado, but overall, a disappointment."
3,Disappointing,"I am a huge Beatlemaniac and put this book on my wish list for Christmas. I wish I hadn't. While there are a few interesting tidbits here and there, if you have read or seen the anthology, it is not new. Mr. Kane represents himself as more of an insider then it appears he actually was. The book contains far more remembrances from Beatle fans then actual Beatle quotes. As someone else has noted, the cd consists of mostly ""Hi Larrys"" from the band. Save your money on this one."
1,Amazingly bad,"I'm the biggest Beatles fan around, but even I had to force myself to keep reading this book. It is probably the worst-written book by a professional writer (a journalist, in this case) that I've ever encountered. It's full of cliches, ham-fisted attempts to be eloquent or literary, and obvious attempts to make his role appear bigger than it was. My advice is to stay away."
3,Author's Personality Overshadows Book,"A moderately interesting book about the 1964 and 1965 U.S. tours. Some cool behind the scenes moments recounted. However, the author's incessant self promotion is obnoxious. I'm certain that the most common words in this book are ""Larry Kane"", the author's name. He reminds us on every page that he, Larry Kane, had unprecedented and incredible interaction with the Beatles which was even more amazing than the many, many other famous people that he, Larry Kane, had met. It would seem that every interaction he had with the Beatles involved them invoking his name several times. Sure.Ok, Larry, maybe you've had a sucessful life. Likely your self promoting personality has served you well in broadcasting. You sure don't sound like someone I would want to be stuck on a plane with, though!"
2,Feels Like You're Reading The Same Chapter Over and Over and Over....,"This book seemed pretty good until about the 4th chapter, when I realized that all I'm reading is how excited the fans were at the concert in (fill in city name here). We all know that already, and don't need to hear someone confirm it for us. Larry refuses to get into anything controversial that may have happened, opting instead to ""fade to black"", or end chapters with teasing lines about something that was to happen later. Very repetitive, boring."
2,Ticket to Ride Review,"In reading this book, I was expecting more stories involving the Beatles. It was full of facts and lots of repetition about each city in the tour. Kane tries to use eloquent language but it comes out as cliches and stories with no relevance to the interest of the reader. There wasn't much new information and the interviews became dull after the first few chapters, because of the recurring information. It seemed that the interviews were just a different way of retelling what Kane wrote about in the previous text."
2,"Cut, paste, repeat...","I have read several Beatles books and this is not one of the best. There are some interesting details, but overall he just repeats the same thing over - wild crowds, barely escaped, fly to next city, repeat. For a professional reporter, the details seem to be very sparse. He also too often mentions something, but then says ""but we'll get to that later."" I feel this would have been a better book if he would have had a co-writer who actually wrote books for a living.I paid 75 cents for this book at a book sale. Glad I didn't pay more.If you are in the mood for a more detailed Beatles experience, check out ""Here, There, And Everywhere: My Life Recording the Beatles"" by Geoff Emerick."
4,The Kevin and Kyra Show,"I was expecting a complete turkey of a film but was pleasantly surprised. Just goes to show you can't always believe the critics, as attested by other reviews here. As long as you're not expecting ""Children of Paradise"" or something, you won't be disappointed. ""Pyrates"" is just a fun - and very risque - romantic comedy. Definitely not for the kids, but adults who aren't too uptight should enjoy it. Lots of funny lines and the direction isn't bad either. Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick really carry this film along, and their onscreen chemistry wasn't just an act, since they're actually married in real life. Good over-the-top campy entertainment."
1,Poorly constructed,After installing the unit only lasted six months before breaking. I would have like to see it in either metal or potted metal to at least last longer.

1,One of my BIGGEST Mistakes!!!,"During Spring Break, I made the mistake of wasting $25 on this junk. The movies are home-made and extremely independent! There was only one or two movies I considered watching all the way through, but I couldn't finish them because of how dumb they are. DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY!!!"
1,Not what I expected!,"This seemed a good combination of movies, for a husband who grew up in the fifties and sixties. It turned out to be filled with amature photographers attempts at horror. It seemed like my neighbor down the street took home movies with patched up sets, and very poor sound quality and then tried to put it to video. My kids could do better with our video camera."
1,Destined For the 99 Cent Store,"Maybe at 2 cents a movie it will be worth it but at a quarter a ""movie"" it's way overpriced. Dig out your dad's old home movie camera, get a bottle of ketchup and a few family members to splash it on in your garage and you can do better than this."
1,If it was possible to leave zero stars . . .,"These are truly bad movies. And the fact that there are 50 of them only makes it worse. These aren't low budget or campy, they're just not entertaining, poorly written, atrociously acted with zilch in production values."
1,Disappointed,"Decrepit Crypt of Nightmares 50 Movie PackThis item is found with the 50 Movie Packs of classic movies. However, the movies look like something from a High School Film Studies class shot with a camcorder, mostly inaudible and difficult to see. I only made it through the 1st disc and couldn't stand anymore. Amazon did credit my account with the going rate of returned items."
5,Reminds me of Punk Rock,"I read a few negative reviews and I'm a little surprised. What did you think you were buying? This is a box set of independent horror movies. Not left over classics released for the 50th time. It's independent horror. No budget stuff. I think this box set is an incredible deal. I saw some bad movies sure, but soo many were really great. I love this genre because it reminds me of punk rock, the guys could'nt play the instruments but they had something different to say. God Bless Independent Horror."
1,"Terrible short films, not movies","If you like really stupid realy gory short films that appear to made by college kids on a weekend drinking binge, then these are for you. But these are NOT Movies."
4,A few of the movies in this fifty pack are good.,"I am giving this a four because I enjoyed about 7-10 of the movies in this fifty pack. I liked ""13"", ""Blood Sucking Babes from Burbank"", ""Matthew"", ""The Crawlspace"", ""Off the Beaten Path"", ""Slasher"" and ""The Summer of the Massacre."" The rest of the films aside from a few others ones were very bad. It is a shame that some of the bad movies are included in this fifty pack because it hurts the credibilty of the movies that I mentioned above. Those movies were actually pretty good considering they are very low-budget independent horror films."
3,cheesy but ....,If you like cheesy movies and bigfoot well go ahead and watch this one. For a super low-budget film well this was as low budget as one gets. The costumes work was very low tech as well as the so-call blood scenes. I had to laugh at some of the acting as well. But like I said if you like super cheesy films then is the one for you. Have fun
1,Waste of money!,"I find it interesting that anyone could call the items in this collection ""movies."" They seem to me to be a collection of ridiculous productions made by a group of rank amateurs using only a home video camera. The photography is abominable, the audio is extremely distorted and appears to be coming solely from the tiny inadequate microphone on the camera itself, and the ""actors"" appear to me to be so unaccomplished that it is almost painful for me to watch them. Although I skipped around, I could only get through four of these home movie clips before throwing the lot into the garbage can."
5,Excellent box set if you're looking for something different,"These aren't Hollywood type horror films, this is underground stuff. If that's your cup of tea you will dig this, if it's not you won't. I liked the majority of the films on this box set. I also own the ""Tomb of Terrors"" set. When I bought this I went in with an open mind and I wasn't disappointed."
3,Enjoyable Read,"I enjoyed this book, and it was a quick read. Good characters and a good plot despite being a little predictable. I am just a little confused as to the ending, and I would love if someone (the author maybe) could clear up one question. Did Jack really have amnesia or was he faking all along?"
3,good knife,"good knife, but horrible sheath and clip. cant clip it on anything and the clip breaks off. but the actual knife itself is very good. its a unique knife."
3,Judgement day,"I almost forgot that Screams For Tina, not Siouxsie & The Banshees was earliest exposure to goth music. I was digging around my cassette collections and came across Screams For Tina's self-titled debut. I bought the tape back in 1993 because I found the name Screams For Tina absolutely fascinating. Little did I know that in some odd way, Screams For Tina paved the way for my love for all things goth.Lead singer Warren Mansfield reminds me a little bit like Andrew Eldritch (Sisters of Mercy) and Ronny (Clan of Xymox) but his voice isn't deep enough. ""Screams For Tina"" is a pretty good album but I personally think it lacks the melody that bands like what I hear in the music by Clan of Xymox and The Sisters of Mercy. The songs simply comes off as average to this goth lover. I wish I could have liked this album more but I just can't. It isn't bad, it is just not remarkable."
4,Classic Gothic Rock mixed with Pyschidelia,"Classic Gothic Rock at it's best, very atmospheric, and well played. Very memorable tunes filled with bitterness and melancholy. The Song ""Kristen"" is a classic, one talented band even though this was their only album."
3,Aptly named,"The author, Lemony Snicket, has named this first book most aptly. The Bad Beginnings might even be called an understatement. The three main characters having been orphaned, find themselves at the mercy of more than one evil character, and dependent on the aid of an adviser who seems powerless to help them except in one aspect of their lives: the money left them by their parents.Although well written, there are time when one wonders if this story is truly written for children/young adults. However, what one young person got out of this was the cleverness of the children not only in surviving, but also in influencing events in order to escape. However, fate is not yet on their side.This is a quick read even for youngsters and it won't take long for anyone whose interest is piqued to make their way through the existing series. I can't help wondering, though, if it wouldn't give some children nightmares."
5,Awaiting more Chetkovich,"I read these stories years ago and still can't get them out of my mind. Chetkovich has the rare ability to completely transport a reader in the space of a brief paragraph. Often, she does it with one sentence. All I can say is, ""More please."""
5,First Rate Fiction,"The work here is so strong, funny, insightful. She seems to only choose her best work for publication. All of it is top flight. This can hardly be said for so much that is printed and puffed up these days. She is great."
1,It broke after two weeks,The unit broke after two weeks use. The unit stopped vibrating because a part in the unit broke off.I ended up returned it.
3,UL certified?,"This is a relatively cheap massager. It vibrates, and has a red heat lamp. It's pretty light in weight.The down side of this massager is that it causes noise to my TV. And it makes my floor lamp running off the same wall plate dim and back on. I had to switch off the floor lamp, and use my other floor lamp that is plugged into a different wall outlet. There is no option of using battery for this unit."
2,bad sperience,the perfum is great but i receved a bery diferent produt than the one i order no happy it all
1,Barely readable,"This book is amazing in it's awfulness. I cringed reading it. I wanted to write apologies to the 'natives.'Did you know toilets are different in other countries??? WOW!! The food is different, too. NO WAY!! Even customs aren't the same as in Texas. BOO!!This book needed a strong editor. The rare interesting anecdote is the same paragraph length as something trivial."
5,My wife loves these...,"I recieved my order promptly, and my wife loves these. She wears them all the time."
5,Jack Black Line Smoother Face Mositurizer for Men,Product is a great for men to use every day! The Jack Black product line for men has a clean fresh fragrance.
2,Burns the face,"I am always trying to find a product that is better than the previous one I've had. Upon a recommendation, I purchased this moisturizer. I used the entire bottle before I decided to write the review. First, this product burns your face, especially if you put in on after shaving. It isn't a minor burning sensation either as the bottle will tell you. I could possibly tolerate the buring if the product results were worth the pain but that isn't the case. The actual moisture is just a greasy film. It is not worth the money. May I suggest a newer product I have found to be really amazing - Kiehls Facial Fuel for men. It is the best moisturizer I've ever used followed by Dermalogica's Active Moist. I would suggest one of these two far superior alternatives. With that said, almost all other Jack Black products I've used have been terrific including their volume shampoo and conditioner."
2,Bleh,This stuff sucks; it doesn't smell very good and it stings when you use it.I would try Jack Black Double Duty moisturizer instead.
3,Suspicious of claims,"I'm skeptical of the claims that this will smooth and reduce wrinkles and after a full bottle, have yet to notice any significant difference. In general, it's a fine moisturizer that will stop dry skin dead in it's tracks and won't leave you too oily, but is hampered by the fact that you can't use it immediately after shaving. The fruit acid extracts that they claim will help reduce lines and wrinkles, stings when applied directly after a shave."
2,I found this out recently!,"I don't actually hate this, but recently, upon research (A FEW MONTHS AFTER I BOUGHT IT), i found this product to be quite toxic to the skin w/ the ingredients contained.Search it yourself with the EWG website: [...] I like it and was going to buy another, but not after researching the chemicals contained in this."
1,poor quality,"This scanned copy is a disgrace. Illegible, unreadable with poor quality graphics. The photography was washed out with many images completely unrecognizable. The design notes often had entire portions missing. Text pages were cropped so most sentences had 2-3 words missing."
4,Huge and Floppy,"This portfolio works perfectly for size, though it is so big it tends to flop over. The handles are hard and plastic, and can be hard on the hands."
2,Interesting concept,"This one should be subtitled ""Experiments in Sound"". Perhaps my expectations were to hear mostly, or all, jazz, with her amazing voice, so I was rather disappointed with the mystical bent, with a sparsely or unaccompanied bent. Sometimes she achieved great effects, as with the unaccompanied Bach, and other times the results were flat for me, like Radiant Flame of Gold, with speaking and drums. Overall, I would say it's a little too esoteric for me and mostly a lack of use of her instrument."
2,Few traces of Laurel's jazz roots,"I suppose Premonition Records sent me a review copy of ""Feather & Bone"" because I'm a jazz writer and Laurel Masse' once sang with Manhattan Transfer. She has an amazing vocal range and a pleasant voice -- but you need to know quickly: This ain't jazz, folks, so don't buy it because of her past affiliation. Frankly, I don't know how you would classify it except perhaps under ""various songs by a good singer who no longer is into jazz."" The minimal accompaniment for her singing is provided by a fiddle, a crystal bowl (I'm not making this up, folks), two frame drums and a bagpipe. There may be a market for this CD somewhere, but not among jazz fans."
5,Extended sales brochure!,"Light on text, this book is a large scale hard-bound color sales brochure giving all the fun details of the sixth-generation Corvette's progress from drawing board to final production. After the design and test history, it steps through the car's features and provides a competitive analysis and magazine review roundup. Think of it as an extended sales brochure with lots of glorious color photos, graphics, and design details, and you'll be happy you bought it. Especially if you purchase the car as well."
4,"Read the C5 ""bio"" first","""Corvette C6"" is a decent follow-up to the fantastic C5-generation biography, ""All Corvettes Are Red"" by James Schefter. This book is not really a biography of the C6, as it reads more like a hardbound Corvette magazine.Some nice pictures throughout the book and the text flows nicely.Definitely read the C5 book first (as I did). It will make this one more enjoyable."
4,Good read,Good read for prospective C6 owners. This book describes the enhancements included in the new generation C6. Plenty of good colour photos also.
5,title,"Good detailed discussion of C6 and compared to C5. Lots of great pictures. Easy reading.I own a C5 and I never realized all the subtle differences; I thought the C6 was a modest upgrade, not a rethink. I'm going to get one. Anyone want to buy a pristine C5?"
2,Buy the dustjacket instead,"The now widely popular genre of ""popular history"" has greatly increased interest in history. Thanks to the great writing of authors such as Steven Amrose, Thomas Fleming, and Joseph Ellis more people then ever are reading non fiction. The Execution of Major Andre should be avoided as pure fluff. The author goes so far as to provide fictional inner dialogue for Major Andre. No background is given to Andre other than some allusions to being dissatisfied working in his fathers counting house. Alexander Hamilton's relatinship with Andre was hardly mentioned. I gave it two stars based on the fact that you can get though in about an hour and a half so it won't waste much of your time."
3,Doesn't look so hot !,"I got this free with the foot spa as a gift for a teenager. Doesn't look too swift to me but as it was free with the foot spa, who can complain ? I wouldn't recommend buying it.."
2,HoMedics MAN-50 StyleSpa Traveler Manicure Kit,"If you pay more than $10 for this you paid too much. It has almost no power at all. The only good uses for this is to keep it in your desk at work or use as a quick fix kit until you can a manicure from a professional or home to your better manicure set. I let my 4 year old use it as a toy, so she can act just like mommy while I use a better kit."
4,The Only Product that could tame this...,"I have the unfortunate honor of having some very strange hair. It is part curly, part straight, part wavy, part kinky and it gets frizzy! This stuff tamed the kink and frizz by adding much needed moisture but my hair was not left feeling weighed down and greasy. It has body and bounce and blows freely in the wind.You have to be careful not to use too much though and not to use it every day. A trick I learned is to brush it in thoroughly after making sure to apply it to the roots and not on top of the hair (especially after shampooing) to make sure that the roots and the hair shaft are well saturated and then let it air dry and style and all is well.I use it every 2 or 3 days and in between I just spray my hair with some leave-in conditioner by Motions and that seems to do the trick. I also sometimes use a product by Hawaiian Silky called 411 which is a combined leave-in conditioner and curl definer."
4,Shut Up,"In response to Mr. David L. Smith, please shut up. Everyone, for the last time, Shut up about the Rozz/Valor debate. Chrisian Death was NOT valor's band, and never was. ROZZ WAS CHRISTIAN DEATH. the christian death lineup that included rozz and valor was basically Pompeii 99 with rozz on vocals instead of valor. Rozz wanted the project that released ""Catastrophe Ballet"", ""Ashes"", and ""The Decompostion Of Violets"" to be called Daucus Karota, but valor INSISTED that the name christian death be used. so, technically, all christian death releases after ""Only Theatre of Pain"" of bogus christian death releases, although anything with Rozz is amazing. stop bitching because you're stuck up Valor's ass and don;t like this album, Rozz is and always was Christian Death, Valor just played guitar for rozz and stole his name. Now, shut up about valor and rozz, its over, it ended when rozz died."
3,An ironically good intro,"Being that this is a collection of early songs from Christian Death in Rozz's latter band format, this album should go over rather well with Shadow Project fans that followed Rozz back into Christian Death up to ""Rage of Angels"" and ""Path of Sorrows"". For even longer term fans this CD is a sad, sad look at Rozz's early music with Valor, Gitane and Rozz's first Christian Death album with Rick Agnew of ""Adolescents"". By long term fan and quality seeking music lover this album is a poorly produced, 3rd rate purchase. A purchase of ""Ashes"", ""Only Theatre of Pain"" and ""Catastrophe Ballet"" seeing the genuine dynamics of the original versions of these songs would bring about the recovery of its listener from this half effort Rozz himself was not pleased with."
3,Disappointing?,"I simply didn't like this release. I feel the production was done badly. I hate the entire ""double voice"" effect that is used through EVERY song. I do, however, like the guitars a lot, and the live rendition of Gary Numan's ""Down In The Park"" was especially... lively. Which is a lot to say about a song by a band called Christian Death."
1,"Ugh, I hate this CD",I really really really hated this CD when I got it. I was hoping for new versions of their classic songs that would sound good. Instead I heard new versions of classic songs that made me want to toss my cd walkman out a window. Some people must like this CD. I'm not one of them.
2,poor quality,"my daughter was so excited - 4 years old. it fell apart before we ever got on the plane. seems just split open. my husband made an effort to sew the thing back together because that's what the ""big brown eyes"" asked him to do....."
3,cute and snuggly but never used for its purpose,My granddaughter falls asleep in my car when I'm driving. I hated to look back and see her head drooping or slouched over and bought this to avoid that problem. She loves to carry it around - but will not use it for any other reason - it's been reduced to a stuffed animal to carry around.
2,I dont like it,I wanted to try something a little different as far as exercising so I got this dvd. I dont really like it. I have done it twice and I dont feel like im getting any type of workout. Maybe if I was more into belly dancing I would enjoy it more but I like something that gets my heart pumping. I think I will stick to Zumba:)
5,I love these sheets!,"When I went to the beach this past summer, I stayed in someone's home. This entire Raymond Waites bedding set was used in the guest bedroom. Not only did I fall in love with the bedroom decor, but also fell like I was sleeping in the most luxurious bed ever! I had to find the sheets at least when I got home. Fortunately for me, I found the Queen size on clearance. These are the only sheets that stay on my bed for any length of time. I love them!"
4,A good continuation on his evolutionary theories,"The author continues to look at evolution and the overlapping of different species, including ours. He looks at how difficult it is to differentiate between nature and nurture, how it's not always important to do so, and how too many people switch definitions when defining human and non-human behavior. It's his usually well written, mass market explanation of evolution and behavior.The book is a bit overlong, the only reason it lost one star."
3,TINY,"these are nice enough but tiny is an understatement.these would be great for a child, not sure about an adult.."
3,Stem is wide and short,"The stem that goes through your ear is impossibly large. I felt like I was getting my ears gauged. And then it's so short that I had to literally smash my lobe with the backing. The backing is too small for the wide stem so it was difficult to get on. The elephants themselves are super cool, but the stem needs adjusting."
4,One of his best albums,"I really like this album, not just as a fan, but the lirics and rythms are wonderful, you can't pass the chance to liste the song: ""HEY"", this song was famous in JULIO IGLESIAS voice,, bobby make this song TEJANO STYLE, , then you can't miss ""SOY YO"" that will melt your heart, then ""A TU LADO"" will make you dream about pulido, don't forget ""AMOR SIN RODEOS"", the best!"
3,Nice history lessons but short on practicality,"This book contains beautiful photographs and a pullout map of the voyage routes, but what I was hoping for were detailed maps of the different cities we are going to visit, availability of transportation options when we disembark, and names of restaurants and specific activity recommendations in each port. I was hoping for a real ""travel guide,"" like the ones I use when I go to Latin America. Other reviews were helpful and some folks warned of the lack of useful information, but the 4-star rating lured me in. Definitely not enough good, current information in here for me."
3,Just OK,Not much info that was useful for those who cruise unless you takeextended tours lasting more then the day trip afforded on a cruise.Kind of defeats the purpose.
4,Great Research for a Cruise,"If you are planning an Alaskan Cruise this is the book to get. I wish I'd had it before signing up for the cruise - I would have picked one that stopped at some of the cities that our cruise won't be stopping at. The book does a great job of talking about cruises in general without giving too much attention to any one cruise line. The book was real handy in choosing which shore excursions to take. If you're taking a cruise to Alaska, this book is much more handy than the Eyewitness Guide Book for Alaska which only covers on-land sightseeing."
3,A little dry,"The map is good, but overall, I didn't find the book very engaging -- a little bit dry."
5,Fantastic guide,"The book is a great way to become familar with Alaskan cruise ports before you get there. An easy read, it helps to make plans as you go into the various ports."
3,Not as good as I had hoped...,I was hoping for more ideas on things to do in port that were not already listed in ship excursions. Had good general info. Interesting facts about Alaskan culture.
5,Helpful book,This book was helpful in choosing a cruise and in knowing what to expect. It answered all of our questions for planning the trip
2,pretty disappointing,Wish I had seen this one at the library before I invested the cash for a book that can't really be passed along.My biggest problem is that the info in the book is too detailed to be useful unless you're lucky enough to take the Marine Highway and have days at each port.
1,Didn't last even one day,"The grooming kit arrived in great condition. However, the finger-nail clipper began to shed metal shavings during the first use, and quickly failed altogether. I highly suggest that you do not purchase this kit.I personally am much happier with a German-made kit from another company. It cost over twice as much, but the quality is outstanding. Incidentally, Conair has a horrendous reputation quality-wise."
2,not really all that exciting,The japanese words and pictures are o.k. but my 9 year old is not interested in most of what is in this book. I'm not too impressed.
2,otra cosa por completo,"La portada del periodico que se ve enla pagina de Amazon es la portada de El Mundo de Españna y lo que acaba de llegar es otra cosa por completo-unas paginas de Mexico, casi todas de deportes. No se dejen engañar. Es otra cosa por completo. Lastima. Me encantaba el periodico viridico."
5,Brilliant,"This novel is amazing. It just gets better each time I read it. It is a skillful blend of humor, irony, emotion, drama, politics and theory. ""The railroad ate the trees, which called upon the rains."" This is a critique of the colonial effect on the environment, which at the same time offers a cause and solution for the drought and crop failures contributing to poverty and disease in our beloved Africa. All in one simple line! This book is a rich treasure chest, each page holds jewels!"
4,"A worthwhile book but dense, confusing and depressing",This 1977 book was the choice of my international reading group at my local bookstore. It's a dense 410 pages long and tells the story of the traumatic transitions in Kenya as it shrugged off the bonds of British colonialism only to be trapped in the same kind of situation when the leaders were Kenyan. It is heavily philosophical and I found it a dense and often confusing read. It was hard for me to keep the characters straight and the tone of the book was totally depressing.This is a story of oppression and it is weighed down with despair. I learned a lot from this book but I must admit that I breathed a sigh of relief when it was over.
5,multilayered and fascinating,"This is a multilayered and fascinating book that addresses various problems in post-independence Kenya.What starts as a murder investigation with the detention of 4 people Munira,Abdullah,Karega and Wanja goes on to reveal issues such as corruption,politics,Urbanisation,social dislocation,colonialism,the emergency period and the African elite.As the novel unfolds the lives of the 3 people murdered entwines that of the detainees in numerous ways.It is also a who dunnit.The detainees are Munira- a teacher,Abdullah-an intinerant trader,Karega- a trade unionist and Wanja a scarlet lady..It is set mainly in the rustic village of Ilmorog in Kenya that later becomes a boomtown.Ngugi tells not only the story of Kenya but that of Africa and other colonised peoples worldwide.It is indeed as relevant today as it was in 1977 when published."
5,Description:,"The kindergarten, first, second, or third grade pupil is studying patterns - the pattern of his own home, his own community, of larger or smaller communities around him, or of our country as a whole where commodities move easily from one place to another. In all these patterns railroads play a vital part."
2,Weak,"Not without it's charms, but.... mostlly treakly and sentimental in the bathic way... comes off more then a bit of an odious character with bourgoise ambitions that he does not care to clothe or hide."
5,Yukmouth belongs on top of the charts,Man this sophmore albulm belongs right next to his first double disc off of rap-a-lot. Listen to the samples is just NOT ENOUGH. Another words buy this ...!
5,This is one of the hottest albums i ever heard,"yukmouth has phaty lycris, every song is great the beat and the lycris u need to go cop this or u r a fool"
4,ITS POPPIN,"OK SO AFTER THE ALBULATION, I WAS IMPRESSED AND I AIN'T HEARD MUCH AFTER THAT LIVIN IN ENGLAND! BUT THEN I HEARD OF THIS NEW ONE ON THE RAP A LOT SITE SO I GOT. ITS HEAVY. THE BEST SONG IS THUG MONEY!! PEACE"
3,YUKMOUTH,"HE IS 1 HALF OF THE LUNIZ.TO TELL YOU THE TRUTHG I DO NOT LIKE THIS ALBUM.THIS IS MY FIRST YUK ALBUM AND I REGRET BUYING IT,THIS RAPPER SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF TUPAC'S OUTLAWZ.IF I WANTED TO GET THIS ALBUM I SHOULD OF WENT AND BOUGHT THE OUTLAWS NEW ALBUM.DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED."
1,Not worth $5,"You can find better advice on the web for free just by doing a little research. It didn't help me at all as I prepare for an interview tomorrow. I guess you get what you pay for, but this short 'article' should really be free. The format was poor and it really only listed 3 common questions and a few answers that weren't all that great. Very disappointing."
2,Jackpot- NOT A WINNER!!~,"Now don't get me wrong, i love Chingy! He's fine and talented but i was dissapointed with his latest CD Jackpot. There were too many stupid skits and lots of curses in all of the songs. The album was basically DIRTY!! I expected so much better from him. Maybe the type of Nelly music. The only good songs are; ""Right Thurr"" and ""One call away."" And holidae In(but after the 3rd or 4th time it really gets annoying). So anyway this is my review of the CD and hope it helps."
2,ChINgY JaCkPoT,"ummm... okey.. i gave this a two star because of the guests on it. Awesome guests, but ... Chingy! SKip to parts with Ludacris, 1-20, more... although some awesome guests, THIS CD IS NOT WORTH A JACKPOT!"
3,JACKPOT,.but belive itor not he have a few hot track on this.I gave it 3 Stars becauseof the hot track and the video for Right Thurr UNCEOCER.ButOverall it's a 3 Buy it.
4,Hey durrty..look at that gurl righ thurr!!,"That ""right thurr"" song is the only annoying one too me, personally. But once i heard all his other songs, it was pretty kewl! I love his c.d. he`s a good rapper, and I love the way he talks! :)"
2,He Better Not Pick Up The Mic Again,"Chingy is the reason people cannot stand rap now and days. This CD is pure commercial crap which is disappointing because usually DTP puts out good music. I can't believe I bought this crap. There's only like three decent songs on the album and those are the first two singles(""Right Thurr"" and ""Holidae Inn"" featuring Luda and Snoop) and the song ""Chiny Jackpot"", just because of the cool beat. Otherwise, this is just retarded. I didn't think Nelly could be outthurred by another rapper but then this no talented wannabe comes out making a whole CD based on 'thurr', 'hurr', and 'whurr'. Don't buy this for the guest appearances either, even though it sounds like it could be aight. Murphy Lee is another crap-rapper and of course he's featured on the CD. And finally I-20, the low voice retard mumbler you've all heard on Luda's ""Move B*tch"" and Houstons ""I Like Dat"".[...]"
3,a so so album by Chingy,Yes he sounds like a card board box but at times he is good.One call away was cleary the best song but there were some other good songs also and no I am not kidding.Not bad Not GoodLyrics 6/10 Production 7/10 X Factor 7/10 Classic 6/10 Me 7/10Overall=33/50 This album gets a high 3 Mics a decent one
2,All right,"Ok, I understand that all this stuff about gettin' girls and rims spinnin' and stuff like that is in, but I agree with alot of the people who said that rappers need something new to talk about. Not really saying much since for alot of people, rims spinnin and stuff like that is their life. Anyway, as for Chingy himself.. he's all right. His voice is a little too nasally but it's not bad. One Call Away is pretty good but Right Thurr and Holidae In have become ridiculously annoying since i first heard them. Mainstream rap. Go and listen to some Mase."
4,All Right Thurr,"Chingy's album is great. Yes, it does have a lot of garbage on it, but what CD doesn't? I usually buy a CD just for one song (Bad Boys II just for Shake ya tailfeather), but Chingy has 3 great songs: Right Thur, Chingy Jackpot, and Holidae Inn."
1,"I love chingy to death, but there is no pint to this at all","I really dont understand why chingy would put out the same cd twice, one with all the curse words on it and one without all the curse words on it. with the curse words on it it is a million time better than it is without all the curse words on it. oh well. at least i own the version which does have all of the dirty words on it, because it is that much better. skip over this cd and get the cd with the curse words on it instead. get that and 50 cents 'get rich or die tryin' cd, the two best rap albums ever."
1,"The CLEAN version? Yo' kiddin' me, right?!","What's this?! This isn't the clean version! They still left the word ""Hoe"" in there, the word ""Ass"" in there, and only the real bad ones are left out, but they didn't quite edit this piece of trach, as evil and rediculous as it is. Man, I love rap, but I gotta say these days it's gettin' redundant. I don't like all the same topics bein' covered over and over and over and over over and over and over and over over and over and over and over over and over and over and over over and over and over and over over and over and over and over over and over and over and over again. Chingy is just one of those cliche rappers out to make a quick buck with the same lyrics over and over.... You get da point. I also gotta ask, as my friend Tom asked once, is he related to T.I.?! They gotta be twins. They're identical. However, T.I. knows what he doin' in dat studio. Chingy just doesn't, I'm afraid.-------G.D. signin' off"
4,Good cd,"honestly, i have to give this album 4 stars. its got good beats, decent lyrics, and some of the best guest rappers in hip-hop today. i just think it would have been better if they cut out all of the skits.1. Jackpot Intro - nothing special (just a man getting a jackpot on a vending machine), but gets u into the mood of the album2. He's Herre - 4/53. Represent - 3/54. Right Thurr 5/55. Jackpot The Pimp (Skit)6. Wurrs My Cash - 4/57. Chingy Jackpot - 4/58. Sample That *** - 4/59. One Call Away - 3/510. Dice Game (Skit)11. Gettin' It - 3/512. Holidae In - 5/513. Juice - 4/514. **** Dat ***** (Skit)15. Mad @ Me - 3/516. Bagg Up - 4/517. Right Thurr Remix - 4/5just a warning, some of the tracks (especially the skits) have ALOT of profanity in them. i dont recomend this album if u easily take offense to that."
3,It's alright,"Jackpot sounds good, really it does. Good beats, flows nice.... but most of it's just garbage. A few tracks on there are good, but only like 2 or 3 of 'em."
2,No Jackpot,"By now you must have already heard the smashing hits ""right thurr"" and ""holidae in"". Well, that is pretty much all you are going to hear, if you buy the album. There are, of course, a few fine tracks, altough the completely lack originality and sound in the very same way that the above mentioned ones do. There are a couple of tracks on which Chingy does an hilarious and desparate attempt to capture the listener's attention by singing. It does not get worse than that for sure, but the rest of tracks you will surely not remember once you turn that CD off. A desparingly average album by a promising artist!"
1,NOT a very good CD,"This is definitely not worth buying. His only good song is not even on this song (Mobb Wit Me)......If you are a fan of cash money and nelly/murphy lee type music (those are 2 different genres and dont get me wrong, they've had a few good songs) then you may like it but if you are a fan of real rap then stay away from this CD."
2,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"After I heard the songs Right Thurr, and Holidae In, I had to buy this album. But after I listened to the whole album, I found out that it sucks! So don't be fooled by 2 songs, this is one of the worst albums of all time. Stay away from it!"
1,WTF no negative numbers?,"awful cd. worst flow, worst beats, worst lyrics. worst rapper alive, well hes up there with fabolous. If you pick this up ur an idiot, get a tru rap cd like big l, or 2pac, this is awful. Whoever signed this guy just needed money"
1,I miss the good ole days,"First off, artist like 50cent, BG, Cash Money Millionares and etc are all a bunch of dudes that only rap about having cars, being rich and riding on 20's. Makes no sense at all the music I've heard from these people and bores me to death after listening to this stuff for like 2mins. I mean sure the beats are tight, but is that all what makes hip-hop and rap music today? Why don't these dudes make their music unique? The repetiveness of this music bores me to death and that why I just stopped listening to the dumb radio(I live in LA so you CAN imagine how many times I hear these songs a day). If you want some real stuff go back to the good ole rap and hip-hop!"
2,An itch not worth scratching.,"The singles ""right thurr"" and "" holida in"" are the only reason to listen to this album, the rest of the songs are a bunch of wack beats and lyrics done by a 5 year old boy songs, I know all people who own the album are those who like "" right thurr"" and the other single mentioned above, bought the album.An itch not worth scratching.An album not worth getting."
2,Only a few good tracks,I really dont think that it is all that good of a CD. Everything on this CD is Right Therre or Right Herre.I have the CD and I really dont think that it was worth the money I paid for it.
2,Get This Guy Out of Herrre,"This guy sucks. Plain and Simple, He has no skill at all. The single Right Thurr is annoying as hell and should never have been made. Chingy says that his style is different from fellow St. Louis Rapper Nelly, but in truth he cant help but try to be like Nelly who I still think isnt even a good rapper either. The main thing Chingy has going for him on this album is that he has major appearences like Ludacris and Snoop Dogg and the fact that his album has been hugely hyped, but thats were it ends. Chingy doesnt prove anything here and seriously doesnt bring anything new to the table."
2,What more can I say?,"Not much really, most of the one -star reviews have pretty much summed up this album in a nutcase. I honestly don't mind this club music IN THE CLUB but when people call this real hip-hop or say his lyrics are good... they need a biaaaatch slap.I really can't stand his voice. I understand he is trying to be unqiue and seperate his flow from others so he doesn't sound monotone but his lyrics are pathetic. I have to admit though these are good for club beats but don't expect some raw hip-hop beats.This is the sad state Hip-Hop has come to these days. I mean I guess this music has it's own section (hip-pop) but it tarnishes what real hip-hop use to stand for. I'm not going to bother going deep because you either already own this C.D., or you're just going to call me a Chingy hater.I'm sure the people who will agree with me are true hip-hop heads, others who don't obviously started getting into hip-hop in the late 90's and think this is what hip-hop should be like. Oh well.Peaaace."
2,"Wack......Even By ""Hip Pop"" Standards (1.5 Stars)","Two words come to mind.....pure wackness. The only reason this album got 1.5 stars from me is because I like ""One Call Away"" and the fact that some of the beats were hot. I use this CD to sit my drinks on because it serves a better purpose as an overpriced coaster. That's all it's good for.......straight up. Anyone who tells you otherwise is probably under the age of 23 or they don't know any better or both. Other than the singles, this CD is awful. Actually, even the singles are kind of wack if you're not in the club when you hear them. When will these pop rap artists learn that hot beats don't necessarily equal a hot album. Chingy is another one of those artists that make file sharing / bootlegging seem like a reasonable cause to get behind. If you can download this album for free, then do it. It's not even worth $5.00Personal Favorites: One Call Away feat. Jason Weaver......and that's it."
4,Country slang!,I enjoy this CD. I grew up in the north but I spent summers in the south. It's just blending the two together and jammin together. I love the songs Right Thurr and Holidae In (featuring Ludacris and Snoop Dogg). I'm one of those who thought I would never like hip-hop but I grew to love it. Those boys are jammin'!
4,The review right below hurr.,"Chingy has come out with a good ,but just short of great cd. His beats are some of the best all year. All of his songs, even the bad ones are at the very least catchy. Good songs include: He's herre, represent,right thurr,one call away, sample dat ..., and holidae in."
2,Chingy - 15 minutes of fame?,"Chingy is another southern rapper, you can hear that on his dialect and the way he spells certain song titles( Just like Nelly did) he's also rapping about simular things as his friend and his rapping style is simular too. I have to admit i liked ""Right thurr"" a good and catchy rap song with a good hook and beats you could dance too. The next song ""Holiday in"" with annoying snoop dogg was not any good though, and if you take a deeper look at the album you'll see that most songs are simular and they are all about girls. It get's quite boring in the end to listen to and my advide would be to just get the ""Right thurr"" single instead. ""Bagg up"" however is a little diffrent, it sound soulish, and diffeent from the others. But it won't help the album to become much better. Some more serious songs with a message and not so many simular sounding girl songs would make this album enjoyable."
2,I'm straight speechless.,"There is nothing to describe Chingy's CD. To be honest with you, it wasn't as hot as I thought it'd be. I don't want to hate, 'cause anyone from the Lou is straight with me. But seriously, dog. First off, his voice is annoying. It's no rap voice. But who am I to say what's a ""rap voice"", right? Yeah. So, you judge that. But it's annoying to me. I got on track 2 and I realized that I couldn't make it through the rest of the album. But I did, and it's gonna be forever stashed in my CD collection. All the songs were about women, bling, and cars. But what else is new, right? Maybe this CD needs to grow on me. I don't know. But I really can't bear to take it out and listen to it again. Chingy's gonna be a hot rapper, so I'm not disrespectin', but I'm not gonna be one of the people who think so. Sorry."
1,Complete Trash,"""Hell yeah this cd is awesome. Since this cd has cool songs, and vivid lyrics. So if your a DTP fan or rap cop this cd now.""This is the same person that has reviewed this CD at least 100 times in different accounts. I can tell because it's always the same review format: ""This cd is awesome. Since blah blah blah."" This person should never be allowed to use this site again because all he/she does is abuse it. All I would like to say to this person is: If you like this CD so much, instead of writing 100 two-sentence reviews on it, why don't you write us 3-4 paragraphs, and go into more detail on why you like it, and the good/bad things about this CD."
1,Terrible,"stop dissin' outkast, chingy fan. andre 3000 should beat you over the head with a guitar, which raises another point. dre is talented, chingy is NOT. so you betta stop dissin rappers that are actually talented. and i've also noticed that chingy fan refers to lots of things as ""watered down"" when he tries to diss them. i'll tell you whats ""watered down"" : Chingy Fan's brain function. anyone who likes chingy should be ashamed of themself."
1,Why did I ever waste my money on this?!,"Look, I like rap, but I can't argue with the people giving this negative reviews. It really is bad. I mean I bought this when I was still in 9'th grade and I was still a stupid teenager who was becoming an idiot. I'm glad as of late I came to my senses and forgot about this trash and gave it away 'cause I don't know if I would've lasted much longer with it poisoning my CD collection, and my mind. I'm gonna stick to good rap, like some of the new ones just starting to get popular (Not Webbie, of coarse. Hate him) So everybody take my advice. If you like this CD now, you won't once you hear a good rapper. Then you'll see the difference. I'm serious, this guy just isn't good enough for any of us.signed, _/Rob X"
1,not for everyone,"let me start off by saying that these songs on this cd might as well have already been done by ne1 else to come out of STL. all the songs are about the same thing. need i say more? if you want songs about women, jewlery and cars then buy this cd. if you want lyricism stick to killah priest or any of the wu tang members and jedi mind tricks."
1,POINTLESS!!!!!!,"When the hell is there gonna be some hip hop with a message instead of all this party rap, hoodrat, wannabe gangster crap. It makes me sick that peaple acctually call this music."
5,Stop all tha hatin between luda and ching-a-ling,"I wish to restate my chicken and beer editorial, but i can't so i will here. ching a ling is awesome! luda is outstanding. all luda's lyrics can blow away rappers (for example, 50 cent and eminem). luda and ching is puttin up a's and lighting up l's on this album.this album has three of the hottest (and three of my favorite songs) songs - right thurr, holidae in and one call away. the whole album is so tight that it is like a small kid sized shirt on a sumo wrestler. it can't fit around him. i guess some of the tight lyrics can't fit you if you don't like this album, but i guess that leaves a little more ching-a-ling for those who like his album to go around.peace out"
5,Chingy Hits The Jackpot,"this cd was dope beyond belief. every song and skit was sizzick and snoop d-o-double gizzle and luda's help, along with DTP made it a masterpiece first album. GO CHINGY!p.s. Grace, i love YOU!"
2,Chingy Jackpot [Clean],Right Thurr(Remix Feat. Jermaine Dupri & TrinaHolidae In Feat. Ludacris & Snoop Dogg
3,...Chingy,From what I've heard from Chingy's album I am really disappointed in him I expected more on the lyrical tip. But he makes up for it on songs like Wurrs My Cash (my favorite song)tellin everybody what being a pimp is all about that monay. Another good song is Bagg up with some good lyrics and a real hot beat.The beats are extraordinary throughout the whole cd especially on Madd @ Me.His cd is more of a party cd or something you listen to when cleaning up your room it gives you extra energy or somehting.The skits are real funny and his voice is real animated so it gives the cd that light-hearted playfulness that makes you wanna get up and do the chickenhead.-Ya girl from dat m-town Lil' Less. I Holla.
1,kool cd but wherez right thurr remix,i luv this cd. it has kool songz like holidae inn and right thurr. well not relly right thurr. becuz 1 reason. the remix isnt on dis cd. I think there r cool other songs too. i also like chicken n beer by ludacris.
3,chingy or spare change?,"This album has some great production. The beats flow fluid and make you bob your head, but what about Chingy? Chingy is one of those rappers who you think how did this guy get a record deal?!!! He flows well on each track but his lyrics are so simple and you can tell he hasn't put much effort in.In all it is a decent album saved by guest appearances by Snoop and Ludacris.....Check out ""Bagg Up"" it's by far the best track."
1,Chingy Sux,"All i can say is you sorry motherf*cker.Aparrently ""A music fan from True Crime Streets Of L.A."" says Chingy (possibly the gayest rapper to ever have a cd that sold out to little idiots that think theyre ghetto) is 10 times better than Tupac Sakur.You f@ggot dont ever let me catch you f*ckin saying that again, cuz if Tupac were alive there wouldnt be clowns like this alive in the rap industry so f*ck off until u learn some respect for Tupac"
4,It's pretty good to me!,"All these reviews are putting the Jackpot CD down. Actually, it seems as if I am the only one who likes it. There are only a couple of songs on Jackpot that aren't very good, but they're tolerable. Other than that, the skits are funny and the songs are enjoyable. Some of my favorite songs are Sample Dat Ass, Holidae Inn, Right Thurr (and the remix), One Way Call, and Represent. Chingy is not a Nelly wannabe because they both have very different styles. Nelly is a rapper/singer and in no way is Chingy that. He's is not one of my top three rappers, but he is up there. Plus he's cute. LOL. Keep up the good work Howard Bailey, Jr. and make a song about me next time."
1,I THREW THIZ CD IN A TOLIET,"When i told 12 girls that i threw thiz cd in a toliet, dey got mad because they like that rat lookin fool name chingy....whut the hell is chingy? hahahaha @ funny name.....Yall people are brainwash by str8 up crappy muzik.....yall should listen to muzik in tha 90-99....like 2pac, 3-6 mafia, or Tommy Wright III....thatz real rap and theze guyz got str8 up talent.....but thiz rat lookin fool cant rap...If yall disagree and like thiz new crappy muzik...then your the type of person that need friends and need to fit in to get a girlfriend.....bunch of lamez nowadayz....dont you agree??.....UNDAGROUND FO LIFE"
1,Garbage.,"A cd full of garbage. people said rap would be a fad and would diminish after a little while. well it will be the case if cds like this are made. i can name a million rappers better than this and chances are most people havent heard of them. but there is no way i can convince this to commercial listeners so there's no point in trying. as rap became more commercial, it was inevitable that this would happen. as it did with rock etc etc. someone though has to keep the good music (Illmatic, Brotha Lynch, Wu Tang, old Oukast like Aquemini) going."
1,Is he wearing lipstick?!?!?!?,I saw on the internet a picture of chingy rapping on stage and a notorious porn transvestite with HIS hand on chingy's crotch. Now I knew chingy couldn't rap his way out of a wet paper bag but I never questioned his manhood. Now that I saw the picture and read the article about Chingy and his transvestite lover I am so done with him. I hope the reviews he gets encourages him to find another occupation. This album is classic garbage and would be a perfect coaster for the next party you have at your house.
1,I LIKE HOLIDAE INN,IS WAY BETTER SO U GOTA GET IT RIGGHT NOW!!!INSTAD OF THIS CD U GET IT OK I GOT JACKPOT MY FAV SONGZ R RIGHT THURR AND HOLIDAE INN.DIS CD WAS MADE BY LUDACRIS.HE IS GOOD BUT NELLY IS GOOD.I AM #1 RAP FAN RAP I LIKE NELLY AND CHINGY HAS COOL SONGS BUT THIS CD DONT K BYE.
1,i'd rather hear a fat guy fart through the national anthem,"than listen to this record, heck, i'd rather watch the movie soul plane 1000 times before this makes my ears bleed (at least with soulplane i can fall asleep through it)"
3,"Worth the money if you are a STL rap fan, otherwise- not.","I am originally from STL and I love the sound of STL- Chingy has it, but this album is weak. He doesn't have the talent of Nelly or Murphy Lee, but it's not a bad start. There are about 3 great songs, the rest are filler."
4,"Nothing wrong with ""hip-pop""","In all fairness, Jackpot is a remarkable debut album. Production is great. Some tracks, such as ""sample dat ass"" fail to capture the attention of pop fans, but other cuts like, ""one call away"" are amazing. Great for the clubs, great for the street, Jackpot really struck a chord with me."
1,Chingy needs to learn how to spell!!,"This cd is why rap music currently sucks. Majorly. The only word to discribe this ""music"" is BAD. Only one song is actually spelled correctly. I can't tell you how annoying it is for rappers to think it;s cool to totally butcher the English language. ""There"" and ""that"" are NOT hard words to spell, Chingy!! ""Hilday"" isnt hard to spell either. Whoever was Chingys English teacher must be so dissapointed."
2,"yeah, we've all heard this before","this is the same old rap formula. this guy has about as much ability to rap as your kid brother. he runs through all the tired rap cliches...skits, spelling things very wrong on purpose (Holidae In, Right Thurr, Madd @ Me, Wurrs My Cash), talkin about money, '...', and himself.i cant see why anyone would really want to listen to this. there are hundreds of other rappers out there who dont get attention they deserve because of guys like this."
1,oh yeah derrty!,"i was just saying how nelly is the best rapper in the game right now, so you could imagine how thrilled i was when this guy who is basically another nelly comes out. two nellys, it's just not right. pretty soon there will be a third, if you have this cd, throw it away or melt it before it's too late!i would have given it no stars if i could."
1,DIS ALBOOM RULEZ!!!!!!!!!!!!,DIS ALBOOM IZ SOOO HAWT AND SEXI!!! CHINGY IZ DA BOMB!!! PLZ BUY DIS!!! ITZ ON MTV SO IT MUST RULE!!! CHINGY IZ DA BESTEST RAPPER EVA AND HIS MUSIK IZ SO AWSUM TAT IT MAKES MEE SCREAM!!! MEDAL MUZIK LIKE IRIN MAYDON AND SIPULTORA SUK EXCEPT LIMP BIZCIT AND LINKIN PARK!!! OMG CHINGY RULEZ!!!All of that was untrue! Chingy sucks and he's the worst rapper ever!P.S. Iron Maiden and Sepultura are amazing and Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park suck!
5,jackpot,"this is hot.chingy representin st.louie and he doin a good job.he's helping DTP get some respect.and all the skits are funny you dig.chingy's flow is different than on the track right thurr.he's stil hot.my favorite songs are he's herre,represent,right thurr,wurrs my cash,chingy jackpot,sample dat a** feat.murphy lee,one call away,gettin it,holidae in feat.snoop dogg and ludacris (my favorite song),juice,and the right thurr remix.chingy does deserve some respect now.his first single came out about a month and a half ago and comes out with his cd already.and the cd has the un-cut video of right thurr everybody gotta see that.i got his back for the rest of his career.look out for ludacris's new album called chicken and bear.DTP doin big things you dig.peace out"
1,not thurr,i hate Chingy. Its benna bad year for hip hop rap pop prolly evan jazz classikal n rock n roll. LOL maybe jus rap but r n b has been good. anyway it mite be cuz of Chingy. He is a bad rapper. i bought this cd thinking it could be hot and it sux and the dvd really sux to dont buy dis. Worst cd and worst dvd of 2003..Well worst cd/dvd ever i am not jokin.
3,"Well, errrrrmmm, nah , nothing new","Well, nothing new here. Chingy (his name is a joke, it aint going to sell nothing), has not added anything new to the game. One major factor of the album i dont like is his voice - it is kinda child-like, therefore cant respect what he is saying and does not authorise myself to listen closely to his lyrics. 3 tracks have some good chorus/hooks but the verses are lame. I do like some of the beats though.His management should've sold the beats to a better rapper who is capable of lacing better hooks with these beats, which in turn will get more albums sold and in turn GET THE MONEY.Chingy, unfortunately not representing the South properly."
2,Read THIS,"Ok. I love how lots of the people giving this album one stars criticize him for not talking on deep issues. Not all rap has to be like that, and can just be feel good. This album isn't great, but has some good hits that aren't bad. One guy here said Nelly is his favorite rapper.... please... Chingy first hit was better than Nelly's.You gotta like some of the productions."
2,"Ohhhh CHINGY,you are so........","Fine.That's all I have to say about him.I could care less about the album.I wouldn't buy the album anywayz!!! He's just FINE,that's all I'm saying!I mean usually you don't get alot of good-looking rappers as singers.The only ones out there in my opinion are CHINGY and CAM'RON!!! Believe that!(Oh yeah, and of course cutie Bow Wow!)"
1,Holidae Inn,Da Best Trak On Dis Kool Album Iz Chilliin At Da Holidae Inn. Cuz Dat Is A Cool Song! U Like Chingy! Well If U Like Dis Cd Den U Like It!!

1,ST.LOUIS RAP SUX..................NO LIE,"st.louis rap(st.lunatics,j-kwon,nelly,etc)all have annoying voices and CANNOT rap.for ppl who dont know,all ppl in st.louis dont say ""thurr"" or ""herre"",etc. this cd is CRAP.dont buy bootleg either.Y IN THE HELL DID THIS CD GO 3X PLATINUM???"
1,Yall better recognize,"Ok dogs, i might be the richest kid in my school and yea i might live in a really big house 2 hours away from the city, but im still a straight up gangsta thug. and all my friends are thugs too. And nothing make me feel more cool and ghetto then this chingy cd. I compare this cd too 50 cents-his rapping sounds like someone taking a dump, but chingy sounds like someone who has a really high voice taking a dump, his lyics dont rhyme, he cant flow, and he says words in really annoying ways which no one really from saint louis would do- this is as gangster as u can get, how could all u people be hatin on chingy i know why cause ur all down to earth and ur not suburban posers, but i am and thats the way to be. And if I see anymore bad remarks i think i might have my dad call his million dollar layer and sew all of you. Im now gonna goo to my big bedroom on the 4 floor of my mansion and listen to some chingy on my 5000 dollar sound system."
3,CHINGY great beats,This album is full of incredible beats wasted with horrible lyrics. The strongest song lyricly is One Call A Way. However if you are looking for a cd to bop your head to in your car to this is a perfect cd.1.intro2.he's herre 4 great intro song.3.represent 3 okay song4.right thurr 3 great beat wasted with pointless lyrics.5.wurrs my cash 3 good song about pimpin6.chingy jackpot 0 don't listen to this song7.sample dat ass 4 party song8.one call away 5 best song slow beat.9.gettin it 4 great song10.holidae in 3 good song11.juice 0 never listen12.madd at me 0 horrible13.bagg up 4 great song14.right thurr remix 4 better than right thurr
2,God knows why I bought this,orighinal no but its pop music so it will go platinum stop buyingfake rap and but actual hip hop
1,I'm sorry for asking my mom for this.,"I'm only 12, and I hate Chingy! Hes aweful! I like his thre singles, but the rest is bad! I cant stand his new cd either and he needs to retire."
2,I don't know??,This cd just doesn't cut it it ain't the cd I expected I though Chingy was the next best thing I was wrong I was dissapointed by this cd it was not a cd I would go and pick up it's a cd that would be burned by a friend.
1,yep it sux,"yep i would have to say chingy sux. why, because the only reson he dosent have a 1 star avg. custumer review rating is because therse some dork who has no girlfriend, has nothing better to do but write annoying two sentence reviews over and over again which have 5 stars, yep chingy fan, ur an idiot."
1,Might I add...,"The only reason this CD has a mediocre customer review average of 3.5 stars is because of one person that gave it 5 stars about 30 or so times over... Without that, this CD would have an average of 2 stars or so... That's not much of a reason to go to the Holiday Inn (not Holidae In) to celebrate.P.S. This CD sucks"
1,WHUT AN EMBARASSMENT TO THE REAL MIDWEST RAPPERZ,"Thiz cd iz flat out horrible, just like nelly. Both of these sissy so call rapperz are an embarassment to the midwest rapperz. All theze people like thiz crap because all the girls think he is cute (he lookz like a damn rat) and if your a guy that listenz to thiz garbage.....then you are showing off to the girlz than listenin chingy's muzik n lyrics....but you dont realize how horrible thiz clown iz wit hiz muzik...dont buy thiz crap...all of u people are hynotized by rap crap from yo friendz and yo televizion....if you want talented real rapperz...listen to all the other rapperz from the midwest...most of them are underground but they can rap a million timez better than thiz stupid clown chingy and dat sissy nelly...DO NOT SUPPORT THIZ GARBAGE...Chingy if you are reading thiz, i just wanna say....YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THA MIDWEST...same goez for that sissy name NELLY...AVOID THIZ CLUB CRAP....and avoid 50 cent eminem lil jon....they suck too"
1,Hmm.. hell no,"What the f--- is this crap ? Does he have a point at all in his rhymes ? Just another idiot trying to get rich without doing anything. Plus, his clothes are too big for him."
2,ppl like chingy cause rap 2 turn into tra$h,"this album got alotta tra$y music such as the rite thurrr which has been played out all akross america,one call away is also being played out the only track dat is OK is represent all the otha stuff TRASH"
2,Save Me.,"Chingy is cute. I'll grant you that. But looks can only carry you so far. This CD is trash & even die hard fans have to know that. Yeah he's cute, yeah his voice is original, but after a while, it gets old. This is like Nelly all over again, which should explain it all. ONLY WORTHWHILE SONGS ON THE CD:* WURRS MY CASH (PLAYS AT THE END OF ""RIGHT THURR"" VIDEO). AMAZING BEAT.* GETTIN` IT (FROM 2FAST2FURIOUS). ANOTHER GOOD BEAT.The rest of the CD is garbage. Save your money & go buy another CD."
1,Awful...,"The album is terrible, except for the singles Right Thurr and Holidae In. Even for those songs, the beat saves the track. Chingy just seems to get in the way."
5,New star of the rise,"Chingy seems to have what it take to be the next big rap star. He has melody in his rap with great hooks and beats that create head bopping catchy songs. This CD and Chingy's style of rap keep you interested in the music, and the guest rappers on some of the tracks give this CD, jackpot, great variety. I think chingy brings a unique quality to hip-hop in his style of lyrics and sound and his connection with other talented rappers, such as Snoop and Ludicrous, make his rap stand out. The songs may not have deep meaning to create social change, but at this point in his career, I don't think that is Chingy's intention. He just wants people to go out and have fun and his music reflects that attitude. This CD will appeal to a wide variety of music listener, even people who would be unlikey to actually buy a rap or hip-hop CD. I bet this CD or Chingy will be up for music awards in several catagories. just you wait and see."
1,Just a guy being used to make a quick buck off a couple songs teenager girls might like,"I'm from St. Louis and have been listening to St. Lunatics tapes since the late 90's. Nelly came onto the national scene and showed the face of the midwest. Chingy is a tool being used by Jermaine Dupri to bottom feed on the St. Louis rapper pool to make a worthless rapper look the part and promote his songs big because their shelf life is on par with ground beef. Nelly is the real deal, he is what comes across in his music which has depth and truth. Chingy is a kid looking at his idols and trying to copy it. He should get on his knees and thank Jermaine Dupri every day and save every dime he makes because even teenage girls get sick of bad musicians (if you can call him that)."
2,"average cd, only few good songs","his voice is not powerful enough, which is the main problem in my opinion. only his famous songs on the album are truly worthy of real merit. Unfortunately, I would not buy it if I were you."
1,Almost non-stop hilarity.,"I gotta admit, this Chingy guy makes me laugh--for all the wrong reasons, just like William Hung (but Hung is better--somehow). I can't help but chuckle a little as I hear his developmentally stunted voice sing about how he's a bada**, even though we all know he's a p**sy who got beat up all the time and whose real name is Duane or Eugene or something.Anyway, the bad part about Chingy, besides the fact that he smokes pole, is this music will irritate you after prolonged exposure. I would say listen to it when you feel like laughing at someone. Either that or just go to the mall and laugh at the loser emocores walking through there. (Don't worry--they won't retaliate.)So 0 stars for this gangbanger but 4 stars for the humor."
1,Straight Buttcheck with Pimples,No need for comment...Top Songs: One Call AwayBottom Songs: The God %^& Rest!!!!
1,horrible,"this cd doesnt even deserve one star. chingy sounds like a white girl with shrink-wrapped vocal cords. he has all the emotion and tone of a female gorilla in labor. he has aobut the same amount of singing talent as olivia newton-john. or prince. hearing him rap makes me want to slit my wrists with the nearest sharp object. throw a bunch of cows in a blazing fire and record it and you got yourself a chingy album. throw $15 in there too. rap requires no talent whatsoever, which is good because he has none. rap can burn. with olivia newton-john. and prince."
4,"Chingy hit the ""Jackpot"" with this one, people.","First off, before I start, look past Right Thurr and this can be an enjoyable CD. I found it very good. I hope he stays around in the rap game."
4,car music,"whats different from this cd than any other is teh BASS. you'll see what i mean if you listen to the cd! alot of great tracks on this cd, #2 is my favorite. 2,4,6,7,8,11,12,16,17 are the best on the cd. worth the $, go grab it now."
4,My man Chingy done did this!!!!,Okay first off i wanna say that this album is a great work. it's not yet a masterpiece but it's not far from it either. I just wanna say keep up the good work Chingy. I love you!!!
4,Promising Start,"Yo Chingy is all-out freshness.He's the newest member of Disturbin Tha Peace and it shines through. Each song has thumpin beats and some crazy rappin. One slow song is One Call Away, a very good slow type song. Chingy brings it on every track. It's starts pumped up and sticks with that formula through almost the entire album. Snoop, Ludacris, and JD make some good appearances, and Murphy Lee. If you're lookin for some new, fresh rap, pick this one up, you won't be dissapointed-Trust Me"
1,Hip-pop needs to come to an end...,"This cd is ridiculous. The song's are terrible. His voice is annoying. ""There"" is not spelled ""Thurr"". ""Holiday"" is not spelled ""Holidae"". When you have songs that are more annoying than Nelly and Aaron Carter combined, you know you have to give it up. Avoid at all costs."
5,"very clever, funny book",This is the funniest book our family has read in a while. It is told from a dog's point of view. The whole family enjoyed it--a great read-aloud.
4,It's nice,You would like this if you are into taking pictures that are really small and can be stuck places. This would be the camera for you if you're into that kind of thing. It's even better if you enjoy the color red. But the film is a little expensive.
4,Fun,"This is a cool little camera, but it's a good thing it comes with an intro pack of film..out of the 6 that I took, only 3 came out because I didn't pull the film out right away. The instructions don't really say this, they just have illustrations, it would be nice if polaroid had specified this. If you're ordering off of amazon, definitely pick up some film, you'll need it."
4,Awesome and fun!,"My friends and I love to use this camera when we go out on the town. Its lightweight, and its easy for us to trade the stickers, no more fighting over copies! And the different colors help us keep our cameras straight! I love to decorate my house and car with the pics of my friends all dressed up and ready to go out. It is affordable enough that if we were to lose them (cross your fingers..) it would be okay to replace. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves spontaneous shots, and is Highly Fashionably! Buy one to match all your outfits."
2,Great until it broke,"I had this for about 2 weeks. I loved it and the idea, however, after two rolls of film i started to hear a clicking and the falsh stopped working and all my film is under exposed. 20 waste of money"
5,First Berenstain Bear book I ever got,"My parents got me this when I was three to make me stop biting my nails. Sixteen years later I still bite my nails like crazy but I have a huge collection of Berenstain Bear books and read them to kids! I disagree with someoen saying this book was difficult for kids to understand. Maybe if they don't have any habits like mentioned in the book, but most Berenstain Bear books are simple."
3,nail biting help,"I love the Bernstein Bears books. My 2 year old had an extreme bad habit of biting her nails so I thought this book may help her. The story is cute but not intended for the very young. Mama and Papa bear try to come up with ways to help Sister Bear stop her bad habit, nail biting. With the suggestion of Grandma Bear they found that giving her 10 pennies at the beginning of the day and taking one penny away every time she bit a nail worked for her. If you like the Bernstein Bears books and like this reward system for bad habits, you should like this book."
2,Rewarding the elimination of a bad habit,"This book rewards the bad habit of nail biting with money if the girl stops biting her nails. This may work for some, but definitely not for my 5 year old daughter who loves biting her nails and has no interest in stopping, for any type of reward."
3,"Good children's book, but puts ideas in kids' heads","As always, Stan and Jan Berenstain do an excellent job writing an entertaining children's story. They add a lesson to it, but I wouldn't feel right not saying this book can actually put the idea of nail biting into a child's head. I am a 20 year old confirmed nail-biter, and reading this book in Kindergarden was my first introduction to it. I still rate it 3 stars because it is well written and entertaining, but this lesson may entice some children rather than get them to avoid a bad habit."
1,"cute artwork, but author is not a story teller","This book is tedious, uninteresting, and hard for kids to understand. There are way too many words. When we finally get to the boring conclusion, the kids don't even understand it. Too bad the cute pictures aren't paired up with an interesting, creative story."
5,Very happy with this book,I and my children are very happy with this book. When I catch them doing one of their bad habits we refer back to the book and they are able to discuss the situation and compare it to the characters. We read this book often and it is one of their favorites.
1,Almost Painfully Unfunny,"I was sorely disappointed in this collection.I'm not fortunate enough to live in an area where I have access to Air America Radio, so I bought this somewhat ""sight unseen"". But, having enjoyed Franken's political books, I decided to give this CD a try.It is, in short, not funny. Not at all. There's a few moments that gave me a brief smile, but nothing made me laugh out loud.Franken certainly had a weath of material to work with -- George W. Bush's lack of intelligence, lies about the war with Iraq, corporate greed, but that's the extent of the jokes: ""ha ha, Bush is stupid"", ""ha ha, they lied about the war"", ""ha ha, corporations are greedy.""This could have been much better. If this truly is ""The Very Best of the O'Franken Factor"", then I don't miss not being able to listen to it daily.Though I must admit to liking the idea of locking Ann Coulter in the Green Room."
2,Not Funny,"I love Al Franken. I highly recommend any of his books - especially the audio editions, read by Franken himself. I listen to them a couple of times a year.This CD, however, is just not funny. You win some, you lose some. Lies/Liars - that's funny! This - no."
3,Inspirational,I was most inspired and taken in by the performance of Yvette Flunder. Her ministering and voice makes the cd worth while
5,Gothic Rock on its best!,One of the best Gothic Rock albums ever. Every music is just great. Not a single bad music on it which is remarkable comparing to the last Nosferatu albums which are the opposite (not one good music). Highly recommended to have it.
3,deep thoughts,"Really hot guys who sign on this cd: holland jancaitis, dan radzikowski, dana steer... um i think that's all of themyay!"
1,Blah....,"I keep all of my health, nutrition, and science books for reference. This was such a light overview of each topic that it left me scratching my head in debate as to what to do with it. With the Doors playing in my head (you know the one: ""...this is the end...""), it will sadly and eventually find its way into the woodstove."
1,Slow and too expensive for what it is,"Although the Verizon wirelesson USB card is nice because you can take it anywhere, it is very slow compared to most cable and DSL. It also disconnects frequently and randomly. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
3,Nat Geo Wild,I can't say I don't like it because I got it for my son who loves it. The problme is out of 4 shows I can only view 3 so how great is that. I would love to be able to view all 4 of which I paid for any help with that?
1,Dispensationalism Gone Wild,"If you are a dispensationalist and do not care to much about context,historical background,or any other sound hermeneutic, this is the book for you!"
5,The End,Read why you will be or not be here on earth when the end comes. This book helps clear the understanding on what the revelation is all about. Hope you are not here when it starts....
4,If You Are Used to Bullinger ...,"... then this volume will disappoint you. I actually think the work was completed after Bullinger's homegoing.In my opinion, Bullinger's hyperdispensationalism kept him from making remarkable insights into the Revelation that are on a par with his most excellent insights elsewhere.If you have painstakingly reviewed the marvelous scholarship of Bullinger (and his team?) is piecing together the timelines of the captivity, your expectations of his work in the Revelation willl be sky-high as mine was.So, while it is still an epic work of substantial value, it's just not quite up to the pinnacle of scholarship that is EWB.That being said: of course buy it. Trade in a couple thousand copies of ""purpose driven trash"" for it."
5,Commentary on Revelation,Very detailed and full of interesting facts! Great study tool for all students of the bible and prophecy!
1,Bad Candle,Candle broke before we even had a chance to light it. We placed on cake and the big crayon broke off. Only candle we had so had to use it still. Will not buy again.
4,"Good, but not representative","This book has excellent speeches - from the famous personalities (Kennedy and Churchill) and the infamous ones(Hitler and other Nazis). However, almost all speeches are from America and Europe and including several rather mediocre speeches of rather obscure personalities. For instance there are no speeches from orators in Russia. Just because Russia was the enemy during the cold war does not mean they were short of orators. And the number of speeches of African and Asian statesmen are so few that it is almost disrespectful.Good book, but could have been much better."
1,The greatest speech of its era omitted!?,"What kind of compendium of speeches can consider itself complete when it omits any mention of the following passage:We shall go on to the end;we shall fight in France,we shall fight on the seas and oceans,we shall fight with growing confidenceand growing strength in the air,we shall defend our island,whatever the cost may be,we shall fight on the beaches,we shall fight on the landing grounds,we shall fight in the fields and in the streets,we shall fight in the hills--we shall never surrender!I purchased this book in 2001 and looked specifically for these lines by Winston Churchill,and the speech was omitted.No mention of it existed in the book.On the other hand, the book includes numerous speechesby British Labour leaders like Aneurin Bevan (?!)and Neil Kinnock. Is that some kind of JOKE?!Until that omission is corrected, this book must forever be considered an afterthought,if not an outright insult."
5,Love the HR-2 Rubber Hood,"I haven't had much time to test it, but I love it so far, it is so convenient to be able to use the hood without having to put it on every single time you need it."
5,Great lens hood with 50mm nikkor lens,"Works very well, fits snug, does what it is supposed to do and meets expectations. What more could you ask for."
2,No roamin',"My unit keeps losing its connection to the base. The instructions for reregistering don't always work. On several occasions, I've had to remove the battery from the handset to reset it."
3,Houston,"Even if I had some ""restrictions"" about the CD, I didn't intend to give it only one star, not at all. Actually I made a mistake in rating it and I feel really sorry. But as I had loved what I heard at the very end of the ""Selena"" VHS movie I bought, the ""studio improved"" results of the album kind of bother me. Thanks anyway and I beg you to excuse my poor English, my first and only language is French."
5,Awesome Album,"Well, this album is great! But what can I say, anything by Ghoti Hook is great! This album is all remakes, so if you don't like cover songs, don't buy it. But just like Banana Man, it's not as good as their first album, Sumo Surprise. But if you like Ghoti Hook, you'll like this album!"
4,Pretty Cool Album,"This is a good album for people who like oldies. Ghoti hook took a bunch of song from back then and some from now, and did them to their own style. It's pretty cool, But I think Banana Man is a better album.I'd say Banana Man is a ***** album. (in my opinion, . . . which should make a diffrence)"
1,I like this music because it's neat,"Ha ha, just kidding! I really give this CD five stars. I just wanted to mess your brain up. A wonderful collection of songs from punk band Ghoti Hook. I actually don't like Hook's music when they're writing it themselves, but this is a great album because, well, they didn't write it themselves. Has every kind of song imaginable, from Pixies to Willie Nelson, from Stavesacre to Elvis, from Michael W. Smith to The Cars. Even my cousin agrees this is a great CD. Don't you cousin?COUSING (name withheld): This is a great CD.See!! I told you!"
5,BIOLOGY TEACHERS N.B.,"This is by far the finest Introductory Biology textbook I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Biology teachers, do yourselves (not to mention your students) a favor--make this the required text for your Biology I (and II) Class! Special Thanks goes out to Dr. Michael Hoefer...for requiring this textbook!"
3,not what was expected,the book i received was not what i expected when purchased but it work out just the same. just keep an eye out make sure your actually ordering what you think you are
2,hawkfellow,"The book is very heavy and large. It would be a load in a backpack. It is filled with color and many pictures, which makes it easy to look at. Unfortunately, the narration is written as though addressed to another accomplished biologist - too many big words when smaller ones would be so much easier to understand and equally - or nearly so -accurate. The whole book should be rewritten for a less educated audience and the number and depth of topics should both be reduced. Too much stuff to take it all in although the book is broken down into what appear to be manageable chapters. This might be an excellent second level book on biology, but seems a little tough for an introductory one. Also, make it smaller and lighter and less costly. Maybe break it into two paperback books, one for each level of two college courses?"
4,Journey to the Ends of the Earth,"The negative review by Forrest Wong is not objective; but then he is entitled to his own opinion. He had missed the woods for the trees in his own forest. The book was not written for self-glorification as wrongly perceived by Forrest.Swee Chiow's past achievements and continuous passion for seeking challenges inspires people to achieve the impossible and realize their dreams. Swee Chiow shows that nothing is impossible if you have self-belief and determination. After reading the book, you can visit Swee Chiow's website at: http://www.daretodream.com.sg for the latest update of his quest for adventure."
3,walking shoe,This shoe is not true to size as a matter of fact it runs smaller I ordered a half size larger than I normally wear and they were a tight fit
5,Nice and comfortable! W I D E width!,"I have extremely wide feet. These shoes are so comfortable. I would recommend these shoes for nurses, guards, or anyone that needs to stand or walk for extended periods of time."
3,Practical; not too comfortable,Disappointed in comfort; to stiff; not enough cushioning support; recuperating from ankle fusion and tendon damage along bottom of feet. I was looking for support and comfort. This shoe was not the solution for me.
1,A well built sneaker!,"I am glad that I got the opportunity to rate this product.The sneaker is fabulous and extremely good since I wear othodics. However, both times I ordered M3910 I had the leather pull away from the sole which was very discouraging. I like the sneaker so much and thought perhaps the second pair would be made better. My Podiatrist commented on how well they were made."
5,Just What I needed,"Knowing that I need wide, comfortable shoes for standing and walking, I am glad I chose these. I was also pleased that the price was within my preference range."
3,"Nice illustrations, insubstantial text","If you've been looking for a coffee table book on opium culture, this volume is just the ticket. The color photos of antique graphics and opium-related instruments and furniture are resplendent.Unfortunately, the text offers no more than a breezy summary of the vast and intricate lore of this problematic substance. There is also a distinct anti-drug bias ... not surprising considering the nature of the author's other writings.If you really want to learn about the history and usage of opium, the book to get is OPIUM: A HISTORY by Martin Booth. Peter Lee's OPIUM CULTURE is also very good."
1,Piece of junk,"The bearing between the upper and lower blades is made of plastic--designed to wear out after a short period of use, and it does.I will replace mine with a Braun or similar well-made brand."
5,The best trimmer there is,"I bought my GMT200t beard trimmer almost 9 years ago and it's still working well. I use it once a week and sometime's have used it twice a week. I think you just have to treat it just like you would your car, don't abuse it and keep your teeth oiled and cleaned and it will last forever. I've gotten good use out of mine and will buy another one when that time comes!"
2,"cute but, disappointed","I recently ordered these for my 2 year old's birthday party and when they arrived they were perfectly intact and not broken. The Elmo faces are super cute and made a fantastic decoration for the cookies I made however, when peeling them from the paper that they are attached to proved to be difficult! The paper stuck to all of the back of the decorations except for one. I called Wilton to see if there was a process that I could use to remove the paper but, I did not receive an answer. I used a knife to scrape the paper off as best that I could and I still used them anyway. I figured a little bit of paper was not too bad."
4,Gut Deutsch Fun!!,"The hex signs, the cows on the cover are a clue to the pure fun of reading Williamson's Pennsylvania Dutch Night Before Christmas. The cadence, the w/v sounds are possible to understand from the very beginning. The explanations of the German dialect are not overdone. Even the names of the cows and steers are Pennsylvania Dutch to the core. The book is fun to read aloud; fun to look through: the illustrations are as joyful as the words. Children outside the area of Amish populations may not understand some of the subtle humor, the names used, such as ""Stolzfus."" But children of all ages will enjoy the overall effect of the book: good fun."
5,Best of Gourmet 2000,"I loved the look of the food in this book. I really felt inspired. The freshness of the menus appealed to me, also. The photography was wonderful! It made you want to pick up a fork and begin to do a taste test on every page. The grilled pineapple with vanilla ice cream was simple to make and a treat for unexpected guests on Sunday afternoon. It is good of Gourmet to study so closly the food culture of another country. It really gave the reader a good sense of what Thai cooking is all about. It is a good addition to the other Gourmet books and something to look forward to every year. A GREAT GIFT for cooks of all levels."
4,Seussical the musical,I was very pleased with the speed at which the item arrived and it was in perfect condition. I will remember this source in the future!
5,How Lucky They Are,"Well I just want to say I love it. I saw the musical with Aaron carter in it, well that wasn't the best thing, I would have rather seen the regular JoJo but other than that I thought it was great! It was a nice little broadway show you didn't have to get dressed up to see and get all fancy. It was nice for kids and adults. I'm 15, 14 at the time, and it for my first time seeing a broadway show, I liked it. The songs are great! I love ""Alone in the Universe"" because I can actually relate to that song on some terms. hehe It has an upbeat tempo at times and others a real down and mellow tune. Too bad it went off the road. I think that's why they were putting famous in, to help keep it going but that didn't work. They should see ""How Lucky They Are"" to even be on broadway at all for sometime. It's like a huge dream of mine. Even if it went bye bye bye. But much luck to the casr in future broadway. :)"
5,about the schlopp in the fridgermerator...all for you!! xxx,"absolutely fabulous!!!!!!!! the variety of musical styles compiled into this single musical is outstanding! the inclusion of all from soul to gospel, po to jazz is beautifully done with wonderfully manipulated lyrics inspired by the works of Dr. Seuss. The story becomes apparant eventually and as you pick up on more and more words you constantly understand more and more about these loveable characters and their wonderful world! I just wish the broadway season hadnt flopped as i'd certainly be compelled to go and watch the show!"
3,Correction!,"I just want to say someone wrote that Cameron Bowen sings on track 7 and 10, I can tell you now, he does not. Cameron didn't join Seussical until later in the run I think. Anthony Cliar Hall sings the role of Jojo on this recording."
5,Bringing Magic To Broadway,"""Seussical"" was shamelessly treated by the critics who wouldn't know magic if it came and kicked them. I flew from London with a friend to see the show and left the theatre elated having witnessed an extraordinary explosion of colour, talent and creativity.You must see this show. But regardless of what happens the C.D is a fabulous recording. It will make you smile, tap your feet and you will find yourself talking in seussical rythms for days afterwards. Everyone I have played this recording to has loved it and bought it.Do yourself a little favour and get this C.D to see what makes great musical theatre happen. Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens are two of the most talented people currently working on Broadway and thank God they gave us this show. All the tracks are splendid but I defy anyone not to start tapping and singing to Oh The Things You Can Think and How Lucky You Are.""Seussical"" is a great, great musical."
4,"Charming, sweet and fun: A little bit for everyone!","I would recommend this score for anyone looking for family music (and/or any theatre fans). Our family saw this show on Broadway (pre-Rosie) - and found it utterly charming!! The interweaving of the various Seuss stories was clever, even piquing our interest in some of the less familiar. The performances by Janine Lamanna(Gertrude McFuzz) and Kevin Chamberlain (Horton the Elephant)were wonderful. Our 8 year old listens to the score through and through on occasion - not to mentionhow much mom and dad enjoy it! We did not agree with muchof the negative press, and found this a fun show for all."
4,Seussical: The Musical - great music,"I got this because our theater is doing this next year and I wanted to hear the music in advance. Some great music - very well done. The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 was that the insert with the lyrics was missing the center pages. Luckily, the lyrics are easily found on the web."
5,I love this musical,"This is one of my favorite musicals ever written - were I to go into Broadway, Horton the elephant would be a dream role."
3,You couldn't expect a better representation of the show.,"When Seussical premiered on Broadway in December of 2000, it was treated by critics as a problematic show with a pretty good score. The cast album reflects that. Most of the music is good--it's Ahrens and Flaherty, who are unquestionably talented--but the performances are very lacklaster on the CD, and the thinness of the orchestrations comes through more here than they do in the theater. The worst part about it is that the CD is not magical at all--the stage version was far, far from perfect, but all of the magic that it possessed was sapped away on the CD transfer. I can only recommend the CD for those who have seen the show--it's easier for them to piece together the parts of the show that are missing. For those who haven't, don't bother--there are other shows' recordings far more worthy of your time, even despite the good score."
2,"eww...into the woods, but not quite","Okay, so they've got a really good idea. Except Ahrens and Flaherty don't really have the know-how to create a show that doesn't include excessive amounts of power-ballads. The music isn't as unique as it could be. I highly doubt Dr. Seuss characters sang power ballads. The plot kind of sucks and the characters, albeit some of them being memorable (when bad singers try to belt out the tunes in amateur productions), the show's writing could use a severe tweak. A kick in the head is due to Ahrens and Flaherty who can't write a piece of consistent music to save their lives."
5,It gets the whole family singing and dancing,"I bought this CD because my daughter was involved in a local production of Seussical The Musical. We play the CD all the time at home and in the car and the whole family dance and sing along to the songs. It gets you moving without realising it. It's a fantastic way to get to know some Dr Seuss stories and made me realise the importance of imagination in children, something that seems lacking nowadays. It's a beautiful story and sung wonderfully by all the performers. I highly recommend this CD."
5,"Haven't seen the show, but the CD is awesome!","I heard this recording before it was released to the public and I have to say that it is wonderful. These characters are so big and they carry such a beautiful poignancy to each song they sing. There is great harmony on this recording. I especially love the HERE ON WHO song. It is a lot of fun! But my favorite song in the show is NOTICE ME HORTON. I loveeee this song! Janine LaManna and Kevin Chamerberlain are wonderful as Guertrude and Horton. They play really well off of each other. I can't wait see what else they have in store for us. David Shiner as The Cat in the Hat is no singer. His voice is obviousy not as up to par as the rest of the cast. But, he provides a sort of energy to the role that it needs. Rosie O'Donnell is playing the part for a few more days and she is by now mean a beautiful singer. But if you can sell your songs, you'll have everyone on your side! ALL AROUND GREAT RECORDING! This is a must buy!"
4,Seussical is wonderful!,"I really enjoyed listening to this CD. It was great! I am satisfied with all the voices, and the music is awesome!"
5,SEUSSICAL SOUNDTRACK is AMAZING,"The Seussical soundtrack is amazing! The songs are great, the singing is great (especially Janine LaManna as Gertrude, Sharon Wilkins as the Sour Kangaroo and Anthony Blair Hall as Jojo - a great voice!) What mostly amazed me was the percussion by Warren Odze and Charles Descarfino in the orchestra. The percussion was fantastic! I can't stop listening too this cd! Seussical truly is amazing!"
4,"Fun, simply fun","No big promises here other than this will add enjoyment to trips, vacations, big dinners, etc -- it is portable candy. It is also a good to have around the house in the way that it is good to have a roll of electrical tape -- it comes in handy for doing odd jobs like a kid's class project that reqs pictures, etc. The film is about $8 for 12 exp -- a little less than a buck a print. Even if you factor in the cost of printing regular film this still has a premium, but it isn't too bad, you get the pictures instantly. All the negatives are only negatives if you use this like a traditional camera. The purpose here is fun.Pluses: - Light, easy to bring anywhere; Instant film; Cheap; Good for kids (no worries)Negs: - Prints are small (large postage stamp); No negatives (one print only), very 'of the moment'"
4,"Great Camera, Great Price","These things are addictive, and I already have a digital camera! I'd give it 5 stars but the film is a little expensive considering how small the pictures are (but note it is NOT $5/picture ... - more like $0.60/picture). Also, the adhesive is very light weight. I guess it's good if you want to remove it from things but I was expecting something stronger."
1,Piece of junk.,"Picture quality is consistently extremely poor. Very small image. Film is over priced. Camera breaks extremely easily. Images do not scan well even on a high quality scanner. I think the product is mostly just a gimick and a fad which I hope disappears quickly. I recieved one for free as a prize in a contest at a web site. Tried it out, and I think it's completely useless. I would not even purchase as a gift for someone. Reguardless as to how much they want it except to satisfy curiosity. It will most likely end up either collecting dust or being sold at garage sales for a penny. However, if it goes out of production quickly enough maybe they'll become collectables."
4,Pressurehed - 'Infadrone' (Cleopatra),"Every bit as out-there trippingly good as their 'Sudden Vertigo' CD(see my review).Another great industrial/space rock piece of work.Too bad this ground breaking band isn't better known.Most enjoyable tracks are ""Turbo Pause"",the awesome ""Audio Energy"",""Beyond The Pale Mirrors"",""Wired For Sound"" and the wailing ""Dark Runs Deeper"".Might possibly appeal to some fans of Acid Mothers Temple,Helios Creed/Chrome,Bevis Frond or Pink Fairies.A should-have."
2,It wasn't exactly painful to listen to but...,"It wasn't good, either. The intro of track 3 sounded kinda like that stupid ""Mickey"" song from the 80's."
4,Great camera for making prints,"Where to start. The pros I guess. If you take the time to learn the camera it can take some VERY good pictures. The fact that some people have problems with it, I think, stems from the fact that they don't take the time to learn all the features. This isn't a point and shoot camera. (Although it does pretty good at that.) That being said, on to the bad. The autofocus [is bad] Really, this is one area that just makes me more mad every time I use it. If you were just using it for landscape shots or non action shots it would be ok (not great, but ok). However, if you have to focus on anything that is moving around much (like kids).... Forget it. Go to manual mode. One peace of advice... Turn the color adjust up one or two clicks and the images look 200x better."
2,Behind the times,"While this camera boasts lots of features, and for the most part that is true, it is not easy to use. There is so many buttons to change to get the right photo, it is time comsuming and awkward.Battery life- none- batteries are only good for about 20 pictures then, new ones must be put in.Quality of pictures are variable and enhancements need to be done on almost all pictures taken.Eye piece and other connected plastic pieces seem to fall off easily and permanentlyThe worst is the video, the quality compared to lesser priced camera is poor and WIHTOUT SOUND. What good is that.Overall I would go with another camera and I will. Most people don't need 5+ megapixels anyway."
2,Owner,"It may be that only my particular camera is a lemon, but both picture taking and downloads are far too quirky."
2,Dimage 7 reveiw,"Shame on the engineers for releasing this camera! It takes fabulous pictures but the only way to power it is with a wall plug (adapter not included) or a motorcycle battery with plug adapter (make yourself). The 4- AA batteries last from 15 to 30 minutes so forget alkaline, and even Monster batteries require 4-6 sets to get thru even a light day. I use a motorcycle battery to get me thru a day especially if I use the attached flash and 1.5"" screen."
3,GREAT LENSE / BAD ENERGY SAVE,"The best of this camera is the Lense the optical zoom, and the quality of the 5.5MP sensor, but the batteries empty in minutes, and the Auto focusing is not fast enougth, and I don't Like the SLR digital. Spanish: Lo mejor de la camara es el lente con el zoom optico y la calidad del sensor de 5.5MP, pero las baterias se gastan en minutos -muy pocos- y el autoenfoque es muy lento y deficiente, y el visor SLR digital no me gusto realmente, creo que el consumidor debe optar por otro modelo, ya que el precio de este es elevado."
1,Your Web Site,Trying to find a price on the Minolta DiMage 7 with out the charger was impossible. Thanks but no thanks
1,dimage 7,"bought this camera new on the high street several years ago. i was full of high hopes on its capabilities and spec. not impressed. makes a good paper weight! dont waste your money, it eats batteries like theres no tomorrow, feels cheap and lets you down at that vital moment......AVOID!"
4,semi-pro?,"4 stars because there is always better!ok you wanna be a pro, well just read the brochure and discover the amazing features pages after pages, I had a Nikon 995 also a great camera very polyvalent but wanted a better performance. The Dimage 7 is perfect for Location shoot I use it with the battery pack or with the AC adapter ...Forget the batteries 1/2 to 1hr it is not like the nikon 1-2 hr...you cannot find a better deal, sorry Canon! Now I am waiting for the Dimage X for my pocket...Bgood:)"
5,This is one of the best,I purchased my Minolta Dimage 7 when I was in Japan about 3 months ago. I have been using it ever since without any written instructions. Very easy to get up to speed with all the functions. Only issue is battery usage if you do not use Ni-Mh batteries.
4,Excellent Camera,"I bought this camera reciently, my first digital experience. Once I got used to the adjustments I was able to take very high quality pictures. the viewfinder isn't perfect, but for the money I dare anyone to finde a higher quality camera. Also, the case on the camera IS NOT PLASTIC. It is made of magneseum, a space age alloy which is extremely strong and lightweight. The reviews knocking the camera for it's cheap construction show little time was taken to really know the camera. Battery performance, blah blah blah. get some rechargeables and you're set."
3,Disappointed,The camera goes thru batteries much too fast. I used the batteries that the Dimage 7 said were done in my Nikon 990 and was able to take about 25 more photos with the Nikon. The Minolta is useless on vacation unless you want to carry 50+ batteries.(minus 1 star) Also - that viewfinder is absurd - it is almost impossible to make out details while looking through it.(minus 1 star) Great lens - nice megapixels - good manual controls - it's ashamed the two things above are so poor. ....
1,"Just because it cost the most, doesn't mean it's the best","My husband purchased this camera as a Christmas gift for me, and it was my first digital camera. It feels good in your hands, and I liked the look, and I read the book, but after only three pictures, the batteries would go dead. So I was changing batteries about every five minutes or less. This was very frustrating, but not near as frustrating as when I tryed to install it in my computer.My computer never did see the camera, couldn't find the drivers, and after two days of working with it, and almost in tears, I gave up, boxed it up and we took it back to the store, to get our money back.I am now in the process of looking for another brand of camera."
2,Megapixels aren't everything,"I bought this camera and returned it in favor of the Canon D30 (a 3.3 MP semi-professional camera with much higher quality images and the ability to swap lenses). The Dimage 7 has plenty of pixels to be sure. But the quality of those pixels is pretty poor. Lots of noise in my shots and the lens caused quite a bit of distortion (keystoning). The battery consumption was also HORRIFIC. Finally, the case design was very poor and cheap feeling. .... This camera was a great let-down."
4,Good Drill,"The drill is a very good quality drill, polished aluminum and tough enamal paint with a very comfortable grip. This drill with the 90 degree handle instead of the pistol grip makes it very easy to get in tight places. High RPM makes it a breeze to cut through aluminum. Drill has no torque but then again that isnt the reason for buying this drill in the first place. Primarily use for aviation sheet metal work. They didnt put the best jacobs chuck on it but still a pretty good one. Chicago makes a good drill and very good quality for the price."
1,Did not fit my ZR500 camera,I had to return the product because it did not fit my ZR500 video camera. I did get rma and sent it back. I'm still waiting for replacement. It is taking a long time. Hopefully I will get it.
3,"Comfortable, but has drawbacks","Pros: Easy to install. Both child and adult seats are comfortable. Magnetic latch to hold child seat in place is good design.Cons: Major con - It doesn't have a splash guard (for those of us w/ boys)! When my son used it for the first time, urine leaked around the edges and in front of the seat. Minor con - It has too many nooks and crannies and is a chore to clean (it would have been better if the adult seat was designed as one piece of molded plastic so that underneath would be easier to clean)."
2,kids toilet seat,"great idea, however, poorly made! within 24 hours of installing it (very simple by the way) my wife sat our daughter down on it with the lid closed and it broke the plastic fitting to the toilet. bummer. still works but very aware of its 'plastic' nature. if you are somewhat large you my want to try something else as i can see this seat sliding right off the toilet."
2,flimsy hinges,"Plastic hinges are flimsy and harder to install than a regular toilet seat hinge. Ours is already broken after only a couple of months of use. We love the two in one seat, so we'll try the MDF version with metal hinges..."
2,Slip sliding away!!!,"I agree with previous raters about the terrible design of the screws on this thing. The seat itself is great and a good idea, the magnetic part is very solid, but the jolly seat slips and slides all over the place because its impossible to get the sharp metal wingnuts screwed tight enough in the tiny holes at the back of the toilet to stop the seat from moving when an adult sits on it (and be prepared to get down on all fours and stick your head down behind the back of the toilet every other day to tighten it!). It is constantly slipping over to one side of the toilet and the rubber flange thingys move around all the time and we are constantly having to adjust it. I would have given it one star, it is so frustrating, but I felt generous because the rest of the seat is a good idea."
3,works great,"It works great! Some people complain it is easy to break but I found it is very solid. One thing I don't like is it uses metal screw, while my old one uses plastic to prevent corruption."
2,The locks getting loose most of the time,"This toilet seat is a good idea for family use, the only disappointed thing is that the seat will slip away after awhile. It happened to my both bathroom. The locks is not made fitted to the general toilet. We have to fix it almost every week."
2,Super-lame installation,"As a toilet seat, it's decent. A touch of flexing when sitting on it, but not a big deal (the MDF version wouldn't have that problem).But the installation! A typical toilet seat you buy today is installed using nylon bolts and nuts. It's quick and easy and only takes four parts total. What were they thinking with this toilet seat? Each side has a bolt, a retainer clip, a gasket, a rubber cone, a metal washer, and a wing nut. With both sides of the seat, that twelve parts! Why would anyone design such a complicated installation method? It probably took me twenty minutes to install it with the retainer clips sliding out of the gaskets as I adjusted and tightened the bolts."
4,Helped my son out,"It was perfect. You could hide it away when you didn't need it, and no one knew it was there. Plus, my son didn't feel like he was going to fall in every time he went to use the bathroom."
4,Gets lots of use in our house,"I hated the toliet seats the you stick on top of the toliet. It was always in the way. And my child didn't like sitting on the big seat. So, we thought we would give this a try. We've had it for a year now, and it works great. My husband had no problem installing it. We've had no issues with sitting on the lid. My daughter did have a little touble learning how to pull down the child seat at first. But, she's got it down now. And, it should get lots more use in the year to come as we have another child ready for potty training."
1,Good Concept but Flawed Design,"I have a problem and concern with the Family Seat (White Plastic version). The seat is a great concept and my daughter loves it and thinks it is very comfortable. However, the pieces that attach it to the toilet make it an unsafe product. It has come loose from the toilet many times; almost causing the user to slip off the toilet. The pieces have now completely broken and the toilet can no longer be attached. We purchased the Family Seat five months ago and we now have it sitting in the box and had to put our old toilet seat back on the toilet. My daughter has since fallen in the toilet because she was used to ""her seat"" on the Family Seat."
1,terrible!,"We never used the baby seat because the seat wouldn't stay attached to the toilet. It broke once, and there was a second piece to use. Then that broke and we gave up. If they made the latch stronger so it would stay attached to the toilet seat, it would be nice, but plastic doesn't handle it.HUGE waste of money."
2,Great Concept- VERY Poor Quality,"My 3 year old twins love being able to get on the potty all by themselves, so I was excited to purchase this item. I absolutely love the idea of this product and didn't want to believe the other reviews saying it was poor quality. However after only a month of using it it has already broken. The piece connecting it to the toilet is plastic and flimsy and cannot withstand much use. I regret not purchasing a more expensive but better quality one from One Step Ahead."
1,Cheap Plastic not worth a penny,"The tightening mechanism is weak and leaves the seat loose. We are average weight people, 5' 10"", 180, being the largest person in the house, myself. I strongly discourage anybody from wasting their money on this product. Do not by plastic if you can help it. If I could return it, I would, but I tossed the box. Returning a toilet seat seems wrong since it is used. Ok, enough ranting, just trust me. P.S. I've never written one of these feedback boxes before. I am not paid to write this, obviously :-)"
2,Spec ops,"couldn't get out ruins of second game, no help, nothing, after more than several attempts, don't like not finishing things, threw it out. Will never buy from this vendor again."
5,bad a$$,Awesome classic rock soundtrack to an even greater film...the book it's based on isn't too shabby either.
4,blow,i was a little worried about the condition of the CD would be in becuase i purchased a used copy but after a detailed inspection i found no real damage to case and none of the tracks skiped. so im 100% satisfied with my purchase on amazon!Blow (2001 Film)
3,REVIEW ON BLOW,I WASN'T THAT IMPRESSED WITH THIS ONE. I GUESS I WAS CAUGHT UP IN THE MOVIE SO THE SONGS SOUNDED LIKE IT MIGHT BE A GREAT CD BUT IT WAS JUST O.K. IN MY OPINION.
4,"Good disc, okay soundtrack.","While the soundtrack to Blow is a great disc to have around to pop into the cd player, there really is nothing exciting about it as a soundtrack. It is full of period pieces, to go along with a period tale. It seems to have become standard practice to entice viewers to the screen with music for which they are nostalgic, which tends to make the movie fit solidly into a category and not stand so much on its own. It does ring of Goodfellas and Casino, and even of Forrest Gump. That said, the soundtrack has a lot of great songs, but you've heard them all before, and probably have them tucked away somewhere already, especially the best tracks. If you don't, well, then this is well worth the money."
4,Make sure your connected,"With songs from the rolling stones and jam ram this is one soundtrack that should be listened to. Blinded by the light by manfred mann's earth band and black betty by ram jam are two of the best songs on this soundtrack. ""That Smell"" and ""can't you hear me knockin"" are two other good ones. This CD has classic rock from the Rolling Stones to KC and the sunshine band. The only thing about this soundtrack that really disappointed me was not having The hackers song, ""stumble you might fall"" from the trailor anywhere in this soundtrack, which in my opinion would have been the best song on the cd, but if you're looking for a cd that has a lot of good music from various artists this check out this soundtrack. BLOW. Make sure you're connected."
4,"The Movie Rocks... Good Music, Too","I absolutely loved the movie, so I had to run out and get the soundtrack to tide me over until the DVD is released. GREAT driving music! Has all of those cool classic rock songs you hear once and a while on the radio but never know who sings them. Everyone, any age, will like this collection!"
3,"Good, not great","""Blow,"" the movie itself, is ""Goodfellas Light."" The same can pretty much be said of the soundtrack as well. The music here really only skims the surface when trying to capture the spirit of that era. That doesn't mean it's a bad soundtrack, I just wish it went a little deeper--that more of the songs that were in the movie had been included here. Of course, the inclusion of Ram Jam's ""Black Betty"" alone almost makes this a worthwhile purchase. Almost."
4,frozenkiwis,"It's a good CD. Too bad they left out one of the songs in the trailer(s) for the movie. Stereo MC's ""Connected"" is a great dance track. Why else would they have picked it for advertising their movie, if it wasn't? But you still get Manfred Mann doing Springteen's ""Blinded by the Light"". You can't always have your cake and eat it too. A good CD worth the price."
2,Sub-par,"I bought this as I had really enjoyed the other two titles by the author. It was nowhere near as enjoyable as Admit it, You're crazy or And I Thought I Was Crazy. In a Cell Phone Minute tells the stories of cell phones 'saving the day' in some way, but many of the stories are uninteresting and unoriginal. It is also a very short book and could be finished in under an hour. I don't think it is worth buying."
4,Very Cute,"Just wanted to add a few points. They are adorable in person but are more of an orangey red than I expected. And, since it doesn't say anywhere that I found, there are 50 baking cups to each pack.They will be adorable for my daughter's birthday party."
1,elmo cupcake liners,"I ordered Elmo cupcake liners for an order that my daughter and I had for an Elmo cupcake cake. When we placed the liners in the cupcake tins and began to add the batter as usual, they all buckled inward and we had to try to keep pushing them back to the edges of the cupcake tins. Very poor quality and would never order them again. They were adorable to look at but didn't work well at all."
5,"Looks great, and sounds good","I bought this more for its looks, for photographing musicians and singers with a vintage-looking prop, than for use on stage, though it serves both purposes for me. It typically costs as much to buy a non-working shell of a vintage microphone, on an auction site, that may or may not look good, so this was a no-brainer.This is not a microphone for sound quality, though it sounds quite nice. The sound, is that of an inexpensive dynamic, true to its price range, and is warm and slightly colored, which works well for the classic pop tunes that you would expect to hear from this style of microphone.I find that using it with a stand that has a weighted base that has good rubber feet, and then placing that on a rug, eliminates a good deal of the noise that it would normally pick up from the stage.Quite simply, this mic is affordable fun, on stage, and in pictures. I plan to have fun with it!"
3,Pretty good deal,"This mic looks good and sounds good, the problems most reviewers have with it picking up ambient noise are related to it screwing directly onto the mic stand and not the cardioid pattern. If you can find a way to isolate the mic this problem is fixed. I manufactured an adapter, but you still can't tighten the threads all the way tight or sound transfers. The mic will not pick-up sounds it is not supposed to, which is the only complaint I have read from anyone. It probably would work a little better on a boom stand, but that detracts from the looks. Overall worth the money."
5,Working sm55 lookalike.,"I am happy with this mic. It does exactly what it is supposed to do.Records sounds with a vintage ""look"".This is a cosmetic replica. Period.Perfect for the look I was going for and not bad sounding."
5,Great Mic at a great price!,Looks old school but sounds awesome! It sounds just as good as it's more expensive brother made by a big company.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"A long-time horror fan, it's sad to see how low our current horror films can sink. BLOOD REAPER is a very bad and stupid little movie. Horror queen Brinke Stevens, not really a good actress, gets top billing for about ten minutes of screen time in the opening sequence, the rest of the cast is simply awful. The plot, what little there is, revolves around a legendary killer who escaped from a nuthouse and kills people (campers) whenever there's a full moon. Then explain why many of the murders occur in broad daylight, and there are two full moons in a row???Shot with a hand held video camera, BLOOD REAPER is at the bottom of the horror barrel."
1,What The Hell?,"Yes, I seen the movie ""Blood Reaper"" and just for you all that havent seen it yet. The movie completely sucked. It's the most stupidest, low budgeted movie I've ever seen. I have no idea how the movie got put out on the market. The imaging on the movie is like watching a video camara shot around everywhere. The Dialogue is also horrible. VERY VERY stupid movie and time wasting to see or buy. I suggest to everyone NOT TO SEE THE MOVIE."
4,"suave, nuanced, atmospheric....sexy","A brilliant idea--the smoothest, most nuanced quasi-electro jazz outfit scoring one of the most ahead-of-its-time films of all time. The music is predictably handsome and atmospheric, but I really look forward to seeing how it wraps itself around the film...fantastic listening nonetheless..."
2,"not all new music, several reworked tracks from older album","I was disappointed to hear several tracks from their previous album(s) on this one. I thought it was going to be all new. It isn't exactly.The repeated tracks are reworked, I think, but they are still kind of the same songs.B"
3,"Useful but lumbering, borders on hero worship","Because Dr. Williams so thoroughly details Huey Long's fascinating life, this book is important. Especially interesting is Dr. Williams' portrait of the young Huey Long and his rise. However, the book often gets bogged down in the Byzantine world of Louisiana politics. It is often plodding. More disappointing is the lack of critical analysis. Basically, Dr. Williams believes Huey Long could do no wrong. Long's conservative enemies were all bad people who wanted to keep the downtrodden in their place. Dr. Williams does not acknowledge that Long's political enemies might have philosophical differences with him. Long's enemies are not really persons in this book; they're all the same caricature."
3,Incredibly researched,"Don't get me wrong, if you want to know about Huey Long, this is the book! It's just not the smoothest/fastest read. I knew nothing about Huey Long before picking this up, except that he was considered a demagogue. Apparently he was one of the most amazing politicians of at least the 20th century, if not in American history. Unfortunately, I knew nothing of the supposed infamous goings-on around Huey and found some of the detailed explanations of what seemed like tedious little legends to be far too long and boring. Never heard of a round robin and I am now convinced I never want to hear of one again. When comparing this book to ""Truman"" by McCullough, there really is no comparison - Truman is the greatest biography ever. This book is incredibly well researched and (in some ways unfortunately) does not leave anything out. PEACE"
3,"exciting at first, then loses focus; also too pro-Long","basically the 1 line above says it. the writing kind of peters out and becomes tiresome even, although Long personally is always fascinating. Also, Williams seems to think Long's abuse of power and corruption were amusing. maybe for the historian. a better read by far would be the great classic, Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men. of course that's fiction, but so is some of Williams's interpretation."
5,Huey Long is God.,Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god Huey is god
5,Huey Long by T. Harry Williams,"A superb job by the author, Williams. If you love biographies or politics you will not be able to put this book down. If you're not familiar with American political history, let's just say that the best stories always come from the fascinating corruption that exists in ""down south"" politics. It brings out the genius in Long's political strategies; a genius that was too much (or perhaps too threatening) for the people of his time (or his fellow politicians)."
5,TOY BROOM & MOP SET,EXCELLENT SMALL SIZE FOR BOYS & GIRLS TO HELP CLEAN. VERY AGE APPROPRIATE AND SIZED FOR SMALL HANDS!
3,New Zealand Music Rocks!,"I love Steriogram... they are the perfect blend of hip-hip/punk... rock... whatever... they really have such a specific sound... They are huge in New Zealand, Japan, Australia... now they are finally getting the attention they deserve over here in the US... They have been on MTV and I noticed Hitcooper.com did a writeup and (I'm really excited about this) an interview with Brad Carter, one of the lead singers... If MTV and Hitcooper.com are giving them attention they must be worth something..."
4,Most Definitely...,"First heard of these guys at a Smile Empty Soul show. They blew my mind as soon as the got on stage. And their CD is everything I anticipated. Its full of humor, catchy beats, and just plain fun. The only thing that was lacking was the need for more Ty rap. Other than that, completely worth the 4 month wait I went through to get it."
3,fun music,"I saw these guys over the summer at a small club, and I loved them. They're so energetic live, and all the guys are really nice.The actual album is a lot of fun to listen to, especially Walkie Talkie Man and Road Trip. Some of the songs in the middle could have been better (""In the City""), but overall it's an enjoyable listen. Good driving music."
3,it's...eh,"Ok this isn't a review of the import, i own an advance copy of the US cd....first off i heard these guys a while, i was coming out of roseland in NYC and if you've been there you know you get attacked by like 40 streetteamers...i got an ep from these guys, i played it and wrote it off as a crappy 311 knockoff.now i have a copy of schmack! and well....my opinion hasn't changed much, except the new 311 cd blew and these guys full length is entirely better..hence the 3 stars, its the closest ive heard of any band as getting 311's sound from self titled...its all catchy hooks and white boys rapping...its fun, i would suggest this band for a sumer soundtrack, its feel good, buy it in may and put it away in september, thats about what it sound like to me...they wont be around long, but i would bet they get one hit and a bit of MTV airplay, theres that pop quality to it."
4,Good movie for the kids,This video has a great variety of the trains of the world and does a good job explaining each one and their uses and purposes in history and our everyday lives.My 2 1/2 year old son loves it. And to be honest I actually enjoyed watching it too.
2,Doesn't interest my 2 yr old,My son loves Thomas the Tank Engine. He also enjoys see trains in person. He has no interest in this video. It's an old production. Bottom line....not for a 2-3 year old.
4,3 year old LOVES it,"I'm not gonna lie- I thought this was going to be dumb. There's terrible narration, it's slow and pretty boring, and there's a part called 'ABC train' that goes through the alphabet that's REALLY tedious but my 3 year old LOVES LOVES LOVES it. Asks to watch it all the time. He can sit through the boring 'ABC train' part like its the coolest thing ever and has really learned about trains, their parts, and the different kinds of trains. I guess I'm learning a lot too through repetition.Trust the other positive reviews of this DVD. I was more shocked than anyone that my kid loves it the way he does."
5,Great Train Information! I loved it!,"I bought this train movie for my 4 year old grandson, and he and I watched it together. He and I both really loved the whole movie, and the sound was fantastic from the trains, and all the information that we were given, made it well worth watching it many more times in the near future! I want a copy for myself!!!"
1,BORING!,"Poor quality and boring, even for my boy who is in love with trains. The narrators voice is uninteresting and slow."
5,Good Video.,"I purchased this for my nephew, who loves trains. It was a bit hit and he loved it. It was delivered on time and was as described."
2,Not impressed,"A number of years ago, these things actually heated the lather. Now they only warm it up some and on top of that the life of these devices is only a few years. I also remember these costing $30 and not $100, so that's a lot of money to spend on something you need to replace every 2-3 years.I loved the hot lather to shave with after a shower, but now it's almost room temperature lather, so not impressed with the direction of this product. It's too bad too as I really like it when I first got one."
4,Nice and warm,My husband likes the nice and warm foam. The only problem is that it only likes certain types of shaving cream
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my husband as a gift. He had been wanting one for awhile. It was great at first but quit working about 45 days after I gave it to him. Now I see that if I want to return it, I can only get a partial refund. Don't waste your money on this. I can't believe I just spent $100 on something of such poor quality. Lesson learned! Not happy about the product and not happy with the return policy. Before buying anything thru Amazon, check the return/refund policy!! This product is definitely not recommended unless you are wanting to throw your money away."
4,it works great,"My husband said the hot lather machine makes the shaving cream warmer that his old one did - and that's good, because he doesn't like cold things touching his face!"
4,pamper him - he deserves it !,"Is your significant other old enough to remember the salubrious pleasure of an old-fashioned rich, warm barbershop shave or has he just read how wonderful it can be? Whatever the case, he'll love this Instant Hot Lather Machine from Conair.Almost before he can pick up his razor this little wonder produces a luxurious warm lather that softens his beard and feels, I'm told, terrific.The machine can accommodate an 11 or 14 oz. can of shaving cream, and has ready and on light indicators. It is housed in an attractive finished container.A thoughtful gift for the man in your life!"
3,Looks Great On Your Counter But....,Nice looking unit-very sleek design but disappointed inoperation-unit just does not get the lather very hot.Warm seems to the best it can do.Followed directions for use to a tee-including not using menthol cream.Spoke to Conair-they just want to exchange the unit.Better than a cold shave....
2,Not that Great,I was disappointing when I took this out of the box. It was just cheap plastic. My first thought was.... I paid $49 for this. I thought it should sell for less than $10. Then I found it elsewhere on the web for less than $10! The lather isn't as hot as I would like it. Not as hot as a barber shop. It was mildly warm at best. You would think for $49 there would be some kind of temperature adjuster to make it hotter.
1,doesn't work,"I bought the hot lather machine by Conair and I have never been able to get the thing to work. So I took it back, bought another one thinking that one was just broke. I still can't get it to work. I really wanted one!"
1,cheap,"The Conair Lather Machine is a great idea, but it doesn't get the lather hot enough. I stop using it after a couple of weeks. Its not worth the time to heat the lather that stays warm for 20 seconds"
2,"Worked great for 1 Year, then room temp cream","This worked great for a little over a year and now it just spits out room temperature shaving cream. Even after letting if sit for over 10 minutes, still the same result. From reading other reviews, I guess I didn't get a ""faulty unit""."
2,Not So Hot Lather Machine,"If you want warm (but not HOT) lather, then buy this product. I used it as directed and found that the machine worked fine, but the lather was not hot enough for my taste."
4,I have tried both Conair models,"I was using the ""Gel"" version of the Conair. It was simply a head unit that you put on top of the shave gel & it would heat up the gel as it passed thru. Never got real hot & it was messy as it was top heavy and always falling over & popping the top off and gel going everywhere. It failed, so I replaced it with the chrome one that works with cream only. The cream is much hotter when it comes out than the gel did. It does cool off rapidly. I do like the ribbon it makes, since I had been using gel, I never liked the pile that shave cream made coming out of the can. The cream version works well, does not make a mess & does what it is advertised to do."
4,An Interesting Ride with the Cowboy,"Cowboy Religion is part autobiography and part philosophy primer. It is the chronicle of a very personal journey, yet in sharing his experiences Edwards opens up a variety of personal paths for the reader to embark upon. The book provides an interesting examination of the dual messages of media/religion that the modern human being is constantly bombarded with. Cynical, angry, heartfelt, and funny, Cowboy Religion is a users guide for the modern mind living in the modern world."
3,This was good,"Then again just really the samething but this was pretty good. Burst angel was an okay series but nothing really that great and ova was just pure garbage that movie sucked, but this was good."
4,"Very good, breathtaking!!","Uau! Zakk Stevens proved there will be a very healthy life for him after Savatage!! This album is breathtaking. Ok, there's no intention to try to hide the fact that sometimes this sound EXACTLY like Savatage, mainly the Savatage of WAKE OF MAGELLAN. But, anyway, it has its own signature, and, man it really goes with a bang! Great songwriting, impecable production, top musicians. What more do we, metal fanas, want?I keep guessing what would be the result if Dream Theater had in their line up Stevens as their vocalist, instead of that insipid hair metal singer La Brie..."
4,"Circle II Circle : ""Watching In Silence""","This is a very good release by Z. Stevens and the guys from CIIC. It's almost as good as the Savatage ""Edge Of Thorns"" release, but it fails to reach those heights IMO. The only thing I didn't like about this release was the lack of any real guitar solos....After being a huge Savatage fan since 1985, and idolizing guitarist C. Oliva for so long, it's hard to hear someone else trying to match his incredible skills. The guitars on ""Watching In Silence"" could have been much better IMO....All in all, if you liked Z. Stevens in Savatage, you'll love this. He sounds great here, and his voice fits this style of Metal very well. I think this is his best vocal performance in a very long time...Try it out. It's worth your attention. Circle II Circle certainly has a future in Metal. It's a four star release IMO...SAVA-LEGIONS RULE!!!"
5,"WELCOME, SAVATAGE FANS!","If you were a fan of ""Edge Of Thorns"" or ""Handful of Rain"" (Savatage Cds with the same vocalist), then you'll be thrown back in time with this release. This gets better and better with each listen. It's amazing how the different band members that have gone through Savatage have been allowed to showcase his own style in the band, and so when they leave, and start their own bands, it's like getting bonus Savatage CDs during the many dry spells of no Savatage CDs.I do realize that longtime members Jon and Chris have their hands in this project, but I am always a vocalist-person. I am not saying Zack is the best Savatage vocalist (I am a HUGE fan of the new Jon Oliva cd), but you know the saying..""It's all good"". That applies."
4,"For all Savatage fans, and anyone who likes hard rock","Zakk Stevens delivers a solid performance on his solo debut. The influence of Savatage is evident throughout (Oliva and Cafferty assisted writing several songs). There are definately spots on this album which will give you a case of deja vu, but that should not be surprising since most the songs are written by the same core writing the last few Savatage albums.If you like the Stevens era of Savatage, you will enjoy this album. Also, if you are a hard rock fan, check this album."
5,FREEEEK'N AWESOME!!!!,"wow! i just got this in the mail today, the best savatage albumn since ""streets"", period. a coupla weeks ago i was listening to poets and madmen thinking, ""i wonder what ever happened to zak stevens?"" so i looked it up and found this. kudos to the mountain king jon oliva, but i have always like zak's vocals better. most of the songs on this disc were co-written with jon oliva and chris caffery. i read a review about this disc on a german website before i ordered it and it REALLY put a lot of hype into how good this is. it was not hype! the sound is very savatage but more fresh and classical than some of the newer 'tage. this disc also has two .mpg file on it one of the waiting in silence video. BUY THIS DISC!!! IT ROCKS!!!"
2,titles in this bundle are:,the first disc hasThe Terror - Boris Karloff & Jack NicholsonThe Trial - Anthony Perkinsdisc 2The Red House - Edward G RobinsonThe Night Has Eyes - James Masondisc 3Night Train to Munich - Rex HarrisonD.O.A. - Edmond O'Briendisc 4Cast a Dark Shadow - Dirk BogardeA Shriek in the Night - Ginger Rogersdisc 5Death Sentence - Cloris Leachman & Nick NolteCause for Alarm - Loretta Young
1,Absolute Junk,"This is the Hollywood Mystery Classics from Madacy Entertainment. It is very very poor quality. The combination of unintelligible audio and terrible video makes every movie in this five disk set impossible to enjoy. For more descriptive reviews look for the Hollywood Classics item on Amazon (also made by Madacy and with similar packaging). I purchased both of these items, and fortunately only opened one of them."
4,Mike Brody = too worried about labels,"alright lets keep this short, since i am essentially only writing this to say that the reviewer Mike Brody is focusing on ALL THE WRONG THINGS! ""oh, this is emo, this is punk, this is rock, this is this"" Guess what bud? good music is good music - screw the labeling! look at his review of the other band he mentions - all he says is how the pixies are more punk than _____ and all that crap. good music is good music, thats all you need to know Brody. quit your labeling and shallowness and listen to it for once without labeling it first. Anyway, DC is a great band if you like emo, so is FFF - pick this up if you like emo and havent already got it. as far as DC albums, try the Unplugged CD - it comes with a bonus DVD of the entire performance - good stuff."
1,I don't do stars. Read the review.,"Carabba has such a dinstinctive voice. Sometimes it drives me away, I can't stand to hear him. So earnest. Most of the time though, I dig the purity of it. And then, it trades on itself -- the songs have got to be all out or they fail. Attempts at cleverness and humor in both ""Townies and Snowbirds"" and ""Pictures of Shorelines"" (You were always my best side) fall flat. All out does not mean loud and fast, just utterly earnest. ""New Year's Project"" and ""Just Until Sundown"" are not the loudest tracks on the album, but to my ear they're the best.The jaded, cynical side of me can't believes I'm really listening to and liking this music. Did he really sing""i'm waiting to give youwhatever the world may bringi'd give you my lifecause i don't own anything""and did I really just sing along? Yeesh."
1,Sometimes you just need to punch someone,"Chris Carrabba's first band.All together now: EEGGHH.Although he's not in it anymore, he left us with this record, which is a unabashed exercise in watered down-lame-core with lamer lyrics.Granted, ""Pictures of Shorelines"" ain't too bad, as it talks about (what else?) a long distance relationship set to ""punk-emo-core"" music so standard it could be computerized. However,the nine other tracks fare much worse (go figure). A laundry list of tried and true emo topics. Love. Love lost. Love far away. Things falling apart.And seeing as how these guys are Christian, they're put on Tooth and Nail, who's biggest claim to fame are introducing the world to Mxpx and P.O.D.If you can stomach ten tracks of standard emo-core music, worse lyrics, then by all means dig in. Hopefully, you can't (and won't)."
3,Decent,"I have to agree with the reviewer who said ""This is some corporate version of what EMO was."" Still, Chris' voice is powerful and the music is very listenable. And at least Further Seems Forever is more intelligent than many of the other ""corporate versions of what emo was"" that are out there. This band is basically Dashboard Confessional with more rock, so if you're into Dashboard you will probably love this."
5,"Great show, great cd",Saw them in concert and they we're incredible and so is the cd. you like fsf then you'll love this cd. i know i do. check out hot rod circuit and thrice too they rock.
3,"What can I say, it grew on me.","My first few listens were like ""well the first song is good, but this band really isn't anything special."" And it really doesn't click till after a few good listens, for me it took quite awhile having the mp3's on my comp for a few months, and every so often going back to give them another chance and finding myself a little more enchanted by them every time. Now I finally wanna go out and get this album simply because its a pretty good effort with some solid songs and a killer (now former) lead singer. The songs just eventually become catchy and the lyrics are very cool. I'm recently into a few EMO bands, and these guys will definetly electrify your soul with some great music. Give it a try, and if ya still don't like it, give it another try. If you STILL don't like it, give it a listen in a month and we'll see how it goes. ~=)"
2,Tree can't survive in US growing zones,"I thought it would be fun to grow my own avocado tree, which would eventually be planted in my parents' large backyard. We live in Texas, so our winters are relatively mild. In addition, my mother has a greenhouse for her more tropical plants to winter in. This tree struggled from the very beginning. It repeatedly dropped all of its leaves, only to start over again. If you breathed on it wrong, a branch would die. We babied and petted this tree for months, but it finally succumbed, and I'm out $100+."
2,tree died within weeks of arrival,"The tree died within weeks of receiving it. The tree arrived in good condition. Despite following planting instructions, it went downhill fast. I'm not sure if it was me, the climate down here, or whether the plant had issues."
5,Great book,"This book focuses on a lot of verbal skills like critical reasoning,writing skills and most important comprehension skills. A great book to work with kids over the summer before school starts."
4,Spec Needs book,This was very informative for my Spec Needs classroom. Thank you. It came quickly and in excellent shape!
5,Effective!,I am a forth grade teacher. I am currently using this book with my struggling reader and it works! He has trouble decoding more than he does understanding. He practices the story at home every night for 4 days and returns it on Friday. The improvement is amazing. He is feeling more confident reading other texts now.
4,Not bad. But not great either.,"The author said that this book wass designed for 4th graders with reading problems. My kid had no reading problem and was about to enter 3 grade. I thought this book might be of the right level. But I was wrong. This book may be good for 2nd graders.But if the level is good for your kid, the book itself is not bad. The articles are interesting. But still, I think ""wordly wise 3000"" is a better choice. The ""wordly wise 3000 book A"" is about the same level."
5,Another Great Buy From Amazon!!!!!!!!,This item is very much worth the price. The photos come out nice and glossy. I love HP products and shopping at Amazon.
2,Animals the way they used to be,"I purchased (and read) this book recently as a gift for a nine-year-old reader of my acquaintance, remembering it fondly from my early reading days in the 1950s. The story is a somewhat anthropomorphic look at the natural history of oppossums, in particular a fellow named Persimmon Jim. It is a kindly, if dated, telling, perhaps too much in an older style to amuse today's high-speed youngsters. The natural history presented is, on the whole, accurate.The racial attitudes revealed are old-school (though still much too common in some parts and some people), not out-right nasty but redolent of the notion that black people aren't really able to do important work. That alone could be the basis for an interesting discussion with a youngster of a certain sensibility.There are other natural history books much more worthy of your or your child's time. All-in-all, I'd skip this one."
5,a timeless work of art,Rick Sebak is a master at documentaries. You will not be disappointed with this entry. I bought the vhs when it first came out and this dvd is exceptional because of the bonus material. Any fan of Kennywood has to have this dvd and I strongly urge Mr. Sebak and/or WQED to consider a sequel to catch up on the advances in the park. Thanks for a great documentary on this marvelous amusement park and hope to see more in the future.
4,Kennywood Memories,"I first went to Kennywood in 1952 and have continued to go when in Pittsburgh over the past 55 years. This DVD is special because it contains so many film clips from the past of the various rides, the ethnic events there such as ""Italian day"" and the old commercials that people of my era can all relate to. I first saw the show on PBS in Houston, Texas in the late 90's and enjoyed it so much that I made myself a video tape. The DVD is even better as it contains many extras to enhance the memory experience."
5,BACK HOME IS ENCHANTING,Back Home was the most awesome book i've ever read besides the Harry Potter Series. It shows how any can know what they want to do in life and go for it and have a little fun along the way! It was a pleasure.
3,"Good, But Room for Improvement","I thought this was a somewhat good book, but there is definitely some room for improvement. There was a decent amount of action, but not enough to catch my full attention. Back Home was slow-moving, too, and I like fast moving books better. When Rusty was sneaking out every night it got sort of boring, because the author would say what she was doing over and over, because she did the same thing every night, and just hearing about her laying sticks on the ground lost my attention. This book was also confusing at times because of how storylines would switch quickly. Another part I didn't like was how Rusty thought that nobody cared about her at times, because from reading I got the impression that that wasn't the case. I also liked this book at some parts. At some parts it was funny, and it had a good ending. I am giving this book three stars, because it was ok, but I wouldn't read it again, or recommend it, but I would try other books by the author."
4,"Sad, but interesting","Virginia Dickenson is sent to America from England as a 7 year-old to be sheltered from World War II. She spends five years with a family there, and gains the name Rusty. When she gets home, life changes dramatically. She feels unloved and her mother expects better behavior, and enforces rules strictly. When Rusty's father comes home from war, he cannot believe that she answers him back, and doesn't take ""because I said so and I am the man of the house"" as a suitable answer. He sends her to an even stricter all-girl boarding school, where she is an outcast. She doesn't know latin, french, or algebra and is made fun of because of her accent. Then she meets a boy who hates his all-boy school, too, and was sent near where she was in America for the war. They discover (on a prohibited secret night visit to the woods) a cabin. Can Rusty survive boarding school?"
5,A Heartwarming Story,"This book was fabulous! It's about a girl who returns to England after the war. She doesn't fit in with the other girls at the boarding school, everything she does annoys her mother at first, and when her father comes home it's even worse! I can't go on, or I'll give away the ending, but READ THIS BOOK! 1"
5,A good book!,"A good book, but definately NOT for 9-12 year olds. I first read it at age 11 and found the sexual implications embarrassing. It is a great book, however, and celebrates women and freedom."
1,Illustrations mar the collection!,"This otherwise fine collection is marred by Knight's illustrations of a child playing Indian! In the party scene, children wear hats, including a feathered headband. Now, anyone can CHOOSE to be a pirate, or a sailor, or one can BECOME a prince or princess. But, one cannot CHOOSE to be a Native American, nor can they BECOME one simply by putting on a feathered headband. Teachers and parents interested in social justice can point this out to children if they choose to buy the book. Consider the parallel: if you are going to allow children to ""be"" a Native American, then it is only fair to allow them to ""be"" a Jew or an African American, or Asian American, or Latino/a American. We readily acknowledge that it would be inappropriate to dress up in blackface, etc. The same acknowledgement and respect is due Native Americans."
5,Absolutely Awesome!,I just LOVE this book. There are so many patterns and having both text and illustrations makes creating them easy even for the beginner (like me.)
1,"Oh, Lord.","I love bad B-flicks. But, wow. I'm speechless! The monster is funny looking, though. It's like Jeepers Creepers made by mental patients, with a budget of $1,000."
2,Doesn't stand up to big dogs,"This product has a good design and it does work, however it is not heavy-duty enough for dogs weighing more than 30 pounds. My 55 pound chocolate lab easily ripped the top seam after 5 days of use."
2,20 pound chug jumped it,My 20lbs Chug dog who is athletic jumped over it as soon as I let him in the car but could not jump back into the back seat. I had to put my windshield sun shield between the bucket seats to make the barrier higher. The box that it was packaged in stated that dogs should be restrained with a seatbelt for good reason. Price was good get what you pay for. Amazon and partner delivered in very short time.
5,Works well,Weren't sure we were going to like this product because it was a thinner material than our other ones we bought in the store but after having it awhile we are very impressed with the quality and how well it keeps our dogs in back at least while we are driving. Thank you
2,What Vehicle(s) Does This Fit?,"I bought this for my 2010 Scion xD, thinking that it was just what I needed to keep our new puppy in the back seat. What I did not anticipate was the fact that it did not properly fit between the car seats; ergo, it would not have worked. The photo needs to be more revealing to show how both the top and bottom straps fit a vehicle's car seats, and the description should inform one as to what type of vehicle the photo depicts the taut usage of the Outward Hound Front Seat Safety Barrier. I eventually gave up trying to make it work/fit my car, packaged it back up, and donated it to our local animal rescue society; maybe someone can put some good use to it. But this left me with a pup that has not yet learned to stay in the back seat and with me still wondering what product would work best for me, my pets, and our small vehicle."
3,Works to prevent nuisance visits to the front seat,"This works to prevent the dog from making nuisance visits to the front seat while driving, but it doesn't seem sturdy enough to be of much use in an accident. I think the best option for safety in an accident is a harness that attaches to the rear seat belt or other sturdy attachment point. (depending on the size of your dog, you may have better or worse luck with it - my dog weighs 50 lbs)Since it's only as high as the bottom of the headrests (it couldn't be much higher without obstructing visibility to the rear), it won't stop a determined dog from getting into the front seat to slobber into your Coke while left unattended in the car while you go in to pay for gas. So if you are really looking for a foolproof way to keep the dog in the rear, look for one of the wire mesh barriers that go all the way up to the car ceiling.For the price, I really can't complain, it works as it should."
3,Seat Barrier,A Good item but a little small for use in my truck. We have a large Ram Pickup and tow a trailer. It seems every time I was backing up or maneuvering our dog decided he wanted to drive. This does keep him in the back seat. I had to adjust it out to the max to get it to fit in our truck.
2,I should have realized it wouldn't work... but it kind of does.,"The problem: any moderately motivated dog can hop over this thing without even thinking about it.What I've found, though, is that it's useful as a training aid... it's a little easier to catch him in the act as he's about to climb over."
1,Didn't work for us,"Within ten minutes of putting this up and leaving the driveway, both of my 30-lb dogs were sitting in the front seat. It was, if anything, more distracting because sometimes they would get stuck climbing over and need me to drag them over or push them back. Didn't work for us."
2,Not made right,This would be great if it fit my car seats. I needed something to keep my little dog in the back of my Explorer. This latches to the top ok but the bottom doesn't and won't latch to anything on my seats to keep it tight because the straps are not long enough. You need to make sure it will fit the bottom of your seats before you buy it. I have to just leave it hanging there and sometimes she will just push her way through it.
3,"Great Idea, but didn't work","When I tried to install the barrier, it just didn't fit right in my car... my dog was able to peak her head above it and rest her head on top of it. I also have a console and it seemed to be in the way of the barrier as well."
3,worked ok,Worked good for my 40lb dog but not so great for my 70lb dog. He was able to knock it down. So may just depend on how good your dog is at staying in the back seat to begin with.
1,Disappointing,"This barrier is simply a sheet of fabric with some clips to go over both headrests and the bottom of each seat. If you have a dog who likes to chew, such as our one year old lab does, forget about it! She demolished the straps in a few days. Good concept but I would suggest that it be made with much stronger (kevlar type) fabric to hold up against the puppy chewing habits."
2,think again,This item was made out of very cheap material. not pleased. it's not effective for my dog he went over it. i don't like where the straps are located. look for a better product to buy
3,It did not work for my boxer/australian sheperd mix.,"The product was easy to install, however one of my dogs (boxer mix) decided it wasn't enough of a barrier and jumped over it. It did prevent the basset hound from jumping over it. I ended up purchasing car harnesses for both dogs which allowed us to make our seven hour move to Fl without incidents."
2,Didn't work for me !,Think it might work in a SUV but my golden jumped and cleared right over unto the front seat. Ending up using it as a cover for the arm rest she insists on standing on. I have a ES Lexus.
5,dog car barrer,"Inexpensive, logical, simple....and was effective. Our dog simply accepted it.Thank you, Jim Malcolm"
3,Dog out smarted it.,"Great product as for keeping the dogs in the back seat of the vehicle. However.. mine figured out how to get around it and in the front seat she ended up in my way. I guess its a great product if your dog isnt too smart at figuring out a puzzle like this, but mine did."
2,Average at best,"I purchased this for my 3 month old Lab/Pit mix. It did not deter her from coming in the front seat at all. She immediately tried to climb over it, and at 20lbs, almost ripped it off. This may work if you have a very small dog, but it didnt work for my pup."
2,Not for Medium or Big Dogs,Its very easy to installCame in excellent conditionThe only problem I had with it is my dog is a medium sized lab so his weight is no match for this. I paw and the barrier was down.
2,"Keeps seats clean, if your dog isn't able to get out","I bought this to keep my 4-month old puppy in the back seat. He likes to be as close to his human as possible in the car, but I wanted him to be safely tucked into the back seat. It is definitely easy to install and remove. However, no matter how tight I make the buckles to keep it from sagging, my dog is able to very easily push it down to get into the front seat. It really does nothing to help the situation. I'm off to buy a different barrier."
2,dog/car barrier,"I bought this product after great reviews and I happily installed it which was not easy. I loaded my weenie dogs into the back seat and they are 10 lbs, 8 lbs, and 7 lbs. They are mini's so they are very short. I was driving down the road and the dogs were easily able to jump over the top. I had to pull over and put them in the back seat. So after yelling at them to stay they decided to chew through the cords keeping the barrier in place. They chewed through with ease. If my weenie dogs were able to break this barrier without any difficulty I would hate to see what a big dog could do with it. I would not recommend this product to any dog owner."
2,Not impessed,"Unfortunately, this did absolutely nothing. Never able to keep it snuggly stretched when fitted around my average sedan front seats so it sagged or if my dog laid his chin on it, it would easily loosen. :-("
2,Started to rip with first use,"Although it has served its purpose, it began to tear the first time we put iton. Wouldn't recommend even though it was cheap."
1,not worth it,"did absolutely no good. my dogs ripped right through it in under 5 minutes. shabily made. don't bother with this, spend the money to get a metal barrier"
3,"It worked, sort of, for awhile","Outward Hound Front Seat Safety Barrier - BlackOur very determined 80 pound lab mix was happy enough to sit in the back seat of our sedan and just hang his head over the barrier to keep us company. That was fine and made for safer driving. However, one evening we left him alone in the car but within sight of us for about 2 minutes. In that time, he vaulted over the barrier and ripped the straps off of one side of the barrier.It was a good experiment, and not too pricey, but if you are going to leave your dog alone in the car at all, unfasten the buckles to let your dog come into the front seat without destroying the barrier."
4,Not for a minivan,"This barrier was easy to install, and works fine if you can block the open space underneath it. The photo doesn't show how long it is, but where the picture stops, the barrier stops. My Australian Shepherds can easily crawl underneath it. It would be much better if there were an optional lengthening flap so it could work in all kinds of vehicles."
1,Good idea but,"This is a good idea, but frankly it just didn't work. It took my 13 lb. ShihTzu less than 5 minutes to leap over the top of it. Also, it takes two people to install it. One on each side of the vehicle. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Works-but could be much better!,"I bought this to keep our 84lb golden retreiver from trying to get into the front of our minivan. It works for that purpose, but the straps aren't really long enough to fit properly between the two front seats. The flap of material also doesn't go all the way to the floor, so smaller dogs could easily go underneath it. Having said all that, it does keep our dog out of the front seats, so both the dog and driver are safer."
2,Does not work for my dogs.,I have a mini dachshound and a shitzu poodle. Both can either climb or jump over it when I am not in the car. Good for driving time though. I drive a large sedan.
3,Front Seat Safety Barrier from Outward Hound,"This product helps some, but there is still a space between it and the floor. My dog, who is pretty smart, has learned that she can wiggle through this space and up into the front seat (I do not have a console between the front seats). So, I would give it a B-. Perhaps it's the configuration of my car -- I don't know. I still need a barrier between the Outward Hound Barrier and the floor of the car to keep my dog in the back seat."
3,Not for me,This is a fair product for small dogs but my 55 pound mix could jump right over it. In so doing she ripped off the elastic from the body of it.
4,Outward Hound Front Seat Barrier,This works well for small dogs but I don't like that I can't see them in the back seat so the mesh should be see through. Doesn't work for big dogs because they jump over it.
5,A very helpful guide to understanding household electricity.,"I found the book to be a very informative guide to understanding the residential electrical system. Very clear discriptions, and pictures guide you through the history of home wiring. Modern electrical systems are described as well as old. A very straight forward and simple guide to understanding one of our homes most misunderstood systems. A good choice for those wanting to understand home electricity better."
5,Who needs an electrician?,"Yep, with a little common sense, a person can be an ""expert"" in record time and eliminate the need for costly electricians invading your house when something breaks, needs to be replaced, needs to be rearranged or updated or whatever. This book provides an easy-to-understand guide to most any electrical problem faced by the home owner up to and including the installation of a new sub-panel ( I have now installed three of them on rennovations in my house and two of my children). Man, have I saved some serious cash doing my own repairs and contracting! The only thing I found it did not cover very well was the installation of three-way switches as you might find in the stairways of multi-level homes. No worries though as you can find this info on the internet and print it out as I did (I simply slipped the hard copy into my book for future reference)."
4,Beautiful overview.,"_Faith and Vision_ is a fitting celebration of the little organization that could (CIVA-from grass-roots beginnings to an international influence of arts on the church and culture). Twenty-five years of different styles, mediums, and subject matter are displayed in the reproductions of over 100 artists' work. The included essays document the history, commemorate achievements, and reflect on the impact of CIVA. _Faith and Vision_ offers an introductory snapshot of faith-based artists working at the turn of the millennium and will serve to measure growth when CIVA celebrates their gold anniversary."
4,Great sketchbook,"Al Rio is a comic book artist who focuses his work in drawing the female body.Stands out as a great artist and very clean, and this sketchbook shows that it still is even in his sketches. A book with enough pages, a good quality and a clean printing and correct. This book is more than a sketchbook because we could watch colour drawings, ink, pencil and great illustration.This work is the first in a list published sketchbooks with the same publisher. I have the 1 and 2, and I suppose they will gradually going further because it is a prolific artist.I miss his autograph at first page, but it forces you to have to visit some Comic-Con to get a personalized autograph."
2,not what I expected,"The book was okay. I have a print I bought from Al Rio's website, and I love his style. There were some great pictures in the book, but I didn't expect to see the nude pictures. For $10 though, I didn't lose much money. In hindsight, I would not buy the book again."
2,Worked for nine months,This item worked fine for 9 months. It then stopped taking a charge. Calling Conair service no help. You have to mail it to them at your expense and pay for mail back to you. This is while it is under warranty. Shipping costs about same as new one. Don't buy.
1,Horrible design,Not only does the plastic guide continuously fall off but the length setting does not remain where you set it. I felt sheer pleasure in smashing this piece of crap onto the floor. Of course now I have a scraggly beard. meh
1,"awful, guide doesn't stick","The plastic guide does not stay in place easily, and this leads to holes in the beard. I used it once and threw it away, after having to shave off the rest of the beard due to the damage this caused."
1,Terrible Product,"The plastic trimming guides do not remain in place and break easily. I only used the product three times before the guide broke. The trimmer does not cut well, causing an uneven and choppy look to one's beard."
1,Piece of junk. 0 stars,"I received this trimmer as a free item when I bought my electric shaver. I am SO happy I didn't have to pay a dime for it because this shaver is horrible. It feels and looks incredibly cheap and is simply awful when used. It pulls more hair then it cuts, cheap plastic pieces broke in a matter of days, and it stopped holding the charge after just a few weeks of use. Good thing that throwing it in the garbage was easy because it didn't cost me anything. Don't spend a dollar on that thing, you WILL regret it."
3,Not bad for price,"I have owned this product for about five years and I really like the eyebrow attachment to trim my eyebrows. That unit finally stopped charging so I just picked up another one on Amazon. Yes, it feels cheaply made and it doesn't seat well in the charger. You have to make sure that the charging light is on and it is seated perfectly. However when it comes to performance it does a decent job of trimming nose hair, ear hair and eyebrows. To be honest I only use one of the head attachments to trim all. I don't find the designated nose hair attachment to work very well. Not a bad product for the cheap price, just don't expect miracles without a little experimentation."
5,Great Trimmer,"My old trimmer (same model) lasted nearly 10 years and wouldn't consider anything else. Though not ""high-end"" this device does a decent job of trimming with attachments for anything you may need."
1,Do NOT buy this,"I love my blue Conair clipper for light shaving (leaving that shadow on my face) and wanted an extra one for the beach house, but it wasn't available, so I bought this. I figured it would be generally the same. It couldn't be more different. The metal on the clippers hurts to bring across the face and it DOES NOT CUT ANYTHING. Horrible product... maybe use if you're using it on hair so long that it doesn't have to contact the skin?0 stars"
2,Great until it stops working,"I have purchased two of these units. They each broke down and stopped working around 9 months in. I took one of them in to get repaired because I just thought the rechargeable battery was defective, but no it was the unit itself. These are expensive and don't last very long.I like the versatility of all of the tools (can trim eyebrow etc...) and it trimmed very well, but I just cant recommend it based on how long it works."
1,$295.34?????,"No way is that price right.I bought one at big lots for $12.99It broke on the first use. Worst trimmer I've ever bought.It doesn't deserve one star.It deserves a beware sign.But if your willing to pay $295.34 for this piece of junk ,I have a bridge l'd like to sell you."
5,To the leass than 5 star reviewers...,little jealous are ya? never got much further with your gtr playing than sitting on your bed huh? too funny!
2,playing the guitar or playing MUSIC?,"Many fingerstyle acoustic guitar instrumentalists seem to gravitate to displaying their technical talent rather than writing great songs. Don is an awesome instrumentalist, but the compositions seem to fall short. It seems that in most cases a catchy guitar riff generated the songs, not the heartfelt desire to write a piece of music. The result is a technical tour de force, not a piece of emotion. Not a bad record, but it is (unfortunately) a bit forgetable after a few listens. Check out Laurence Juber or Michael Hedges if a you seek a more wholistic blend of chops and emotion-pulling composition."
2,Still a wanna-be,"With this album, it is clear that Ross is still inspired by Michael Hedges.Unfortunately, with few exeptions, this album is harmonically poor and repetitive."
5,Modern day Mozart,"Don Ross is certainly one of the strongest players in the world today. His technical prowess always underscores the composition and this is what sets him apart from the mob. I have had the opportunity to see him perform live...absolutely unforgettable.Keep a vigil watch on the entertainment columns published in your area...or easier still, his website ..www.gobyfish.com...he could be heading your way. Huron Street should impress music fans in general (no one could ever accuse rap of being categorized as music) and guitar purists will surely drool."
2,These shirts are cheap (the bad kind of cheap),"The fabric is so thin and sparse that I can easily see through it. Also, they're coarse to the touch and very unlike the soft cotten feel you'd want. I'm throwing all of mine away."
5,Offers a basic grounding in the burgeoning field of genetics,"Although Genetic Testing For Cancer: Psychological Approaches For Helping Patients And Families offers a basic grounding in the burgeoning field of genetics and its ability to predict cancer risks, its primary focus is upon the psychological dilemmas that patients concerned about the possibility of hereditary cancer must deal with. Covering the emotional impact of test results, family and child matters, decisions about prophylactic surgery, social and ethical issues, and much more, Genetic Testing For Cancer covers its subject in an evenhanded manner, discussing various difficulties in terms especially intended for psychologists, therapists, and mental health providers. Black-and-white diagrams illustrate this thoroughly researched and highly recommended assembly of professional techniques."
1,Nissan Z & ZX 1970-88 Repair Manual,Thsi book is the worst repair manual I have ever seen. It is very vague and tries to cover too many vehicles at a time. Almost no detail except for the wiring diagrams.
1,Poor Organization,I regret the purchase of this poorly organized manual in which there is an attempt to encompass to many vehicle types in one manual. the information has too many gaps for even experienced mechanics. if you have ever flipped through a Clymer manual published by intertec you will understand truly sensible organization of a technical manual. i only wish one was available for the Z's. don't waste your money on this book.
2,Not crazy about fruit in main courses,"I guess I'm just not used to having fruit in my main courses. The book has a lot of recipes, but the ones I tried, I was not impressed with. I think it was basically because I don't like fruit in main courses. I have had other nationality foods that do have fruit in their main courses, but they hide the fruitiness to more of an aromatic flavor. I just guess that African food is not for me."
5,Wonderful CD,"This CD has helped ease my (not so easy to get to sleep!) son to sleep for the past several months. The music is beautiful and peaceful, the words are comforting and uplifting. My son is not yet 2 and he hums some of the choruses! I highly recommend this CD for anyone who wants to relax, and especially for babies/young children.This was given as a gift to me, it's so good I am purchasing this CD for all of my friends when they have a baby!"
1,LOTUS ORGANIZER 6.1 AND VISTA DO NOT MIX!,"It's not December 2010 and neither Amazon nor IBM gives a good rats's ass as to the problems we all are having with the Lotus Organizer 6.1 that we purchased from AMAZON and were told at the time that it would work well with VISTA!!!!I contacted Amazon a few months ago and said I was interested in upgrading my old Lotus Organizer. I informed Amazon that I currently use Windows Vista. I was told that the Lotus Organizer 6.1 would run fine on my computer, NOT. It will not run and I am totally ticked off.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
4,"I had version before and I really liked it. Version 6 is also good, but not as good as Version 1. Sales went fine.",The sale itself went fine. Would definitely do business with this person again. It was absolutely fine. Good job. Thanks
4,Best diary on the market,I love Organizer. I have been using it since 1993. There is nothing that is as user friendly on the market. I wish IBM would keep working with it.
5,A great little package,I've been using this program since March 1992 and I love it.My wake in fright moment is that Big Blue will decide they don't love it any more and it will get left behind in the inexorable software creep.I've already had about 10 battles with various technocrats in different places I've worked to try to take it from me but so far ...Go on give it a go it's worth every cent.
2,It's not the one your parents read you 30 years ago!,"I expected the same story from when I was a child. It was one of my favorite books. I was disapointed to learn how it has changed. Chicken Little is hit with an acorn instead of an apple. He runs to tell the police, rather than the king. It just seems to be lacking that fairy tale quality about it that I loved."
5,A secret Merry Christmas to adult receiver,Sent for a Christmas story with a message that they had to read and read until Santa came.. Santa came and told they to nametheir Chicken that he gave them with chalk sides and chalk to write on it. They loved it!! And great fun for UsA California Girl
2,Chicken Little in the Brave New World,"This version of Chicken Little is too convoluted and politically correct for my enjoyment. I enjoy a twist on an old tradition sometimes, but this was too different for me. It was a brand new story."
3,Non memorable mystery...,"J.R.L Anderson's ""Death on the Rocks"" is an average mystery with a twist: the hero sails small seacraft. The hero, who was in the army, finds the body of a woman in a dress on the rocks while sailing. At first everybody believes it was suicide, but after the hero is nearly killed by a letter bomb, murder is evident. Apparently, the woman was Gwen Rosing, who was caught up in a real estate fraud scandal. Now the hero and a few policemen believe that a clandestine heroin smuggling operation was the reason behind the murder. The hero is smart, as he solves the obscure code on the locket of the dead girl, and captures the bad guy."
4,awsome!!!!,"I really love this product, the chain is very tiny and light and the cuff fits my ear perfectly. The cuff doesn't even hurt and it feels like its not even there. However I ordered 2 of these one chain is shorter than the other, but its a really great earring. Hot Topic use to have a product similar to this but after it was out of stock, they never bothered to make more. But anyhow if your thinking about buying it, GO BUY IT!!"
3,Cute,It's a cute little ear cuff. Chain is not very long but it works well for a simple design. Sometimes I have troubles keeping it on my ear though.
2,Disappointed,when I saw the item on the website I thought it would be great for me. When I received the item I was very disappointed. It was so small I could not believe my eyes. I would have sent it back but when I went to try it on the back piece being so small it dropped & i still haven't been able to find it. I think for $15 I should have received something bigger or at least two items for that price. I do not recommend anyone purchase this product if they are looking for it to be the size of the picture because it is not...
4,Question?,"I got this product for my daughter and she loves the style and feel of it. However, She was wondering where exactly the cuff part is supposed to hook onto your ear. She's not really sure to put it lower or higher on her ear. Could someone please explain to me where to put it or send a picture. Thanks."
3,very small,"not much chain to dangle--very small and cheap-looking, but for the price it is what it is!"
3,another required reading,there was a movement based on this book. how silly. it was dry and very textbooked reading... *shrug* it's ok!
1,Flimsy...,"While the idea behind these products from Wild Republic is a good one, unfortunately the construction and quality are extremely poor. We'd had these items for less than a few hours before arms and limbs began breaking off. If you can find them, Animal Planet makes a series of similar playsets that are of much higher quality and that our son enjoys more. Otherwise, better to do without entirely than waste money on these cheap, flimsy toys."
2,Broke Easily,"This was purchased for our four-year old and two-year old boys. The animal figurines we're great, but the legs and arms easily separated. You can snap the pieces back in, but they come off again very easily. The boys like it, but you have to constantly fix the pieces."
2,Hard to review because HDD/DVD recorder needs repair.,"I had watched a total of three DVDs using the HDD/DVD recorder when the loading drawer became stuck (as signiifed by a ""BLOCKED"" message on the unit's screen). I had not yet tried to record a DVD. I actually thought that the ""BLOCKED"" message was because I was trying to record something from the HDD to a DVD. I'm still not sure if this can be done.The home theater surround sound works very well in my viewing setting. I don't have a large room, so the relative distortion and audio response profile is not very demanding.I give the HDD/DVD Recorder 1 star based on reliability and 5 stars based on the premise. Based on my setting, I give the home theater stereo 4 stars for the money. The total best that I can give the entire package is 2 stars."
5,the best of the best,DVDR.....You can recorder from the tv in a dvd disk all do you want is like a divo...and has hard disk too is the best of the best this is my second one I had for many years and broke and I have lucky to find this again is hard to find....Home Theater the best sound ever heard from a movie it's incredible any little sound you can hear from the speakers I love this set you can't find nothing better than this...
1,not worth the money,"I just received this product about a week ago and have tried it out every night... I find that this product was not worth the money, I wont be buying this again."
3,so-so,this product made my hair too wet for daily use. it was so-so. not sue if I would recommend to a friend .
3,"Let your feet do the talkin""",I really did enjoy the documentary...Short but kept my attention all the way through...Loved it.....It gives you a look into our past..
3,The Price on Amazon is Outrageous!!!,"This is a great book with lots of fun and useful vocabulary words in it. These are all the words Chinese in the states lie to you about and say do not exist. It's also very handy for living in China as it provides a crash course in all profanites and gets you going along your way.However, the price of this books should be 10-15 bucks, twenty at the most. The fact that they put it here for 100!!!! You've got to be kidding me. Better to sit down a Chinese in China and give them ten US for an hour long session with all the same information. Outrageous indeed."
4,Great!...But harsh...,"I certainly understand how Amelia feels in ""Amelia's Family Ties""...most of the time. In previous books, when she talked about her father, she seemed eager to know more about him. Now, when she gets the chance to meet him, she seems to have an awful time. Even though what her father did was wrong, he is still trying his best. OK, so the teddy bear wasn't for Amelia, but its the thought that counts, right? And what was with the ""I hate you!"" when Clara invaded Amelia's privacy? I would be mad to, but out of respect, for letting me stay as a guest in their apartment, and because she IS related to me, I wouldn't go THAT far. But, if you ignore Amelia's harsh reactions and feelings toward her new family, the books is really great, along with the rest of the series."
3,Inconsistent - 2Lp's on 1 cd,"Tracks 2,3,5,8,13 are a must for all students of the Alto Sax. Actually it's a bit more than 2Lp's. The final 2 tracks with Stitt on Tenor apparently were unissued. Sonny plays some fantastic Alto Sax on the first session but on the 2nd session released under Don Patterson's name things go awray. Sonny's tone is off and Patterson takes the first solo on organ a couple of times. Only WHAT'S NEW seems to hold up."
1,Very hard to get it to work.,"Hi,I received that product today. If you are planning to use it for mouse clicks then it might be good for you.If you are planning to use it for something else then it is pretty much useless.1-) The device driver for this unit does not work on any 64bit operating system.2-) even on 32bit system it is a really hard to get the driver work since they have not been updated since windows xp.3-) The unit does not have any gui for setting the key macros. So you dont get what you see.4-) Even after setting macros, the macros do not transfer with the unit. So it is impossible to configure it in one windows than transfer it to another one.Pretty much useless..."
2,Have no been able to get this to work with Windows 7!!,Became a paper weight after my disabled father upgraded to windows 7. Very annoying as I personally spent several hours researching alternatives for him and thought this to be the best one.
1,No 64 bit support,"The product appears well constructed, and that is about all you can say about it. There is no 64 bit OS support, so for most modern computer is the product is worthless"
3,Don't pay money for this CD,You can download this CD for free from the US Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps website. All military recordings are public domain and not intended for sale.
3,"Skilled players, but hardly traditional...","A well recorded CD of expertly played pieces. The drum parts are not traditional, but show some rather contemporary, even funky, syncopated accent influences. The addition of single valve bugles is a weird intrusion for those expecting ""fife and drum' music. I like the sound, but it's not what I was looking for.They're very good at what they do and be warned--what they do isn't traditional fife and drum music.But they are excellent. I like it even though it stirs up no feelings of historical... uh... anything."
3,Too fast for me.,I mistakenly thought the tape was longer instead of faster. I usually walk 4.2-4.5 mph on the treadmill. This was way too fast for that. The songs were familiar but just speeded up from usual tempo. Too uncomfortable to walk to.
5,BUY THIS RIGHT NOW I AM FREEEKING SERIOUS,WOW I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I WATCHED THISi expected this to be a stoner hood crap movie\BUT IT WAS ALL THAT AND MOREit really was funny and was made with excellent craft skillzthe outtakes are amazing had me laughing so hard i dropped the blunt and my house burned down.wow i think some people named digital soul made itCHECK IT OUT I LOVE IT AND MY WIFE LOVES IT AND MY MISTRESS LOVES ITPEACE
1,"The Karate by Demura in Vols 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 but all DVDs are damaged.","This product needs to be reproduced and all existing volumes destroyed. I have tested everyone, more than one sample each thanks to a friend. All of them are damaged and sold as new and functional.If you want this product make your voice heard at Amazon and get rid of current vendors and find a vendor that sells the good product that actually plays on DVD players.I highly Recommend Sensei Demura's work - but production for retail, etc sales is not worth the plastic they are printed on. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNTIL THE VENDORs GET A DISTRIBUTOR WITH GOOD, high-quality product to sell. Dr Z"
4,shape blocks,I bought this for my kids for Christmas. My MIL had an old set and my kids fell in love so we surprised them on Christmas day. I also bought the pattern pages.
2,Too expensive,"Not a bad product if you like cooking reality shows, but it is too expensive (19.95 USD) for the length of the DVD. The DVD is about 20 minutes only (yes 20 minutes) and only covers one contestant! I guess the high cost is because it is made on order since it is not available. Remember it is a show that was cancelled way back by TLC."
3,This book was [...].,"This was a very self indulgent book, but it was still good because it often focused on the worth of farm work. However, I often found myself asking, ""Does this guy have any friends?"" He must be really out there socially. Perhaps he's a repressed [...].His subtle high-brow mindset, I'm sure, is probably pleasing to the liberal reader, who may find it enchanting to know the author still maintains a literary train of thought, and his diet 'inclining to the Mediterranean.' He often refers to other cultures, and he seems to really enjoy milking his cow (read into that one what you will).Again, it's an okay book. There's plenty of parts to skip over, though. I'm sure Hemmingway would've written about farming much more differently."
4,"A Very ""Quiet,"" Read","Bottom line, this is a quality book and I do recommend it. But, there are some things that have to be said. This is a very little book about a very small farm. It's extremely well written and Mr. Winchester's obvious intelligence and knowledge become more and more evident page after page. Mr. Winchester is highly observant and understands what he observes. The thing is, he observes the quiet, tranquil world of the small, rural farm. This isn't a bad thing, in fact, I think it's a very good thing, but the farm is populated by insects, birds, a few livestock animals and essentially no other people. Additionally, clouds and the weather are significant players in the book. The book almost reads like a series of letters from a distant friend who is highly intelligent and fills you in on the simple aspects of his life on his small Oklahoma farm. Ultimately, this may be the, ""quietest,"" book I've ever read about one of the quietest lives I've ever read about."
4,A delightful account,"This lovely small book was a delight to read. The author made a considered and deliberate decision, at a very young age (while still in college) to lead a simpler life, close to the earth. I really admire his adherence to his principles and his problem -solving skills in a time when we all just call someone else to do things.I loved reading about the methods he used for farming, building, and general survival with none of what we consider the amenities of life. I found myself feeling very calm as I read this book....a sure sign that the conveniences of modern life bring stress with them!"
4,Intriguing,While a bit on the fringes of what is possible for most folks this little book does provide some very good glimpses of the virtues and rewards of simplicity as a life-style. I plan on returning to it again someday and would recommend it.
1,"plugged in, turned on, it fried","lasted all of 0 minutes. plugged in, plugged in gps and phone charger, flipped switch, lights came on, then lights went out. Now a $9 piece of plastic junk"
5,Jude Returns!,"Great second record from Jude - the new song ""king of Yesterday"" is an anthem, and the whole record in beautifully crafted and produced!"
2,Calculations,"King of Yesterday is a commercial calculation that fails and succeeds in equal measure. Eccentric singer-songwriter Jude attempts to expand his fan base with these 11 pop songs, confining his oddball humor (and humanism) to a few near-novelty tracks, and laying on a sincerity that fits him like a cheap suit. Highlights include ""The Not So Pretty Princess"", ""Sit Ups"", and ""Teenage Girlfriend"" (the most desperately funny cuts here). Taste in covers: Bread's ""Everything I Own"" which is not - wrong - a joke. At least, not intentionally."
5,Great 3rd Album,"Once again, Jude gives us another great album. In the tradition of No One's Really Beautiful, and 430N Harper Ave., Jude gives us an album that is not only fun to listen to, but one you know he had fun putting together. Upbeat, pop you can't help bobbing your head to."
2,"Was a huge fan, now just kinda like him....","man oh man I wish Jude would have stuck to his original style.. I see everyone recomending No One is really Beautiful which is a great album, but I STONGLY suggest 430 N. Harper Ave. which is one of my all time favorite albums, very poetic, and sometimes rather dramatic, but it's mostly him and his guitar which is what I like. King of Yesterday seems to be geared toward Middle School kids.. I don't like it at all... Jude! please go back to acoustic!"
3,SPITTING IMAGES,"CLONED is a sanitized TV movie focusing on a young couple who find out that their deceased son was cloned twelve times by a sinister organization. Of course, no one believes them, but they find their lives in danger as billions of dollars are on the line for the cloning organization.Elizabeth Perkins (WEEDS, BIG) plays the aggrieved mother with an offhanded sincerity which works for her; Bradley Whitford is her skeptical husband; Alan Rosenberg is the brilliant doctor responsible for the cloning; and Scott Paulin is the cold calculating company bigshot. It's all pretty tame but the performances and storyline are interesting."
2,Should concentrate more on Ali,"As an longtime follower of Ali, I can honestly say that this book doesn't do him justice. I have met the champ several times and he has a completely different opinion than was written by the Mr. Bingham. It flip flops through the events connected to his experience dodging the draft. People should read David Remnick's book for a more accurate account. I expected more."
2,Not Worth The Money,"I thought this book would be interesting but, really, was just utter disappointing. There were several factual errors, especially the one about the Ali-Liston bout. Also, many statements were made with little justification, quoting third hand sources, people who had little connection to Ali. I wish that the authors would have concentrated more on how Ali himself felt, what was going on in his mind at the most crucial time in his life. Finally, this book was dull, poorly written and very scattered."
5,""" Must"" reading for all Muhammad Ali fans.","Muhammad Ali's five-year battle with authorities began in 1966 when he refused induction into the Army as a conscientious objector. The resulting conflict would strip him from his boxing championship and nearly send him to prison at the peak of his boxing career. Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight charts his stand, struggles with the government, and civil rights relationships of the times, examining both his life and decision. An important, revealing focus."

Please consoider it in your next set of dreanm factory movies, to have this film would be a bonus.Ken barrett Mooroolbark Vic Australia"
3,When oh when?????????,"Is there going to be a concise and complete Rolling Stones anthology done? When Hot Rocks was issued over 30 years ago,it was missing such greats as It's all over now,The last time,and She's a rainbow.Now comes this, and it's missing Heart of stone, Play with fire,and As tears go by, but it does have a group of later day,current THROWAWAYS instead! Do the band members even care anymore? I guess not!"
2,Good But...,"While this may be the best Stones collection so far, it still is far from complete. Why include new songs (which cannot be classics yet) when there are so many missing songs? Where are Slave, Play With Fire, 2000 Light Years From Home, Heart of Stone, Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker), Lady Jane, Time Is on My Side, Waiting on a Friend, I'm Free, One Hit (To the Body), Harlem Shuffle, She's So Cold, etc.? Maybe a 3 CD set would've contained them all. Also needed is a boxed set that contains the best version of all of their studio tracks. Right now, there are too many US and UK versions of their original albums and even more non-LP tracks floating around.[DW]"
4,Forty Licks + Hot Rocks = mmm mmm good,"If you own these disks and Hot Rocks, you'll be a happy Stones fan, as I am. Just saw the senior citizens' tour in Anaheim, and they may be old and raddled, but these dudes still rock out!! May they live forever -- and this collection of smokin' tunes is just the beginning of that immortality!"
3,Another greatest hits collection?,"I was not really excited when I heard about this coming out. The cover is cool but listening to the record for me is better in my opinion. Some bands are better off with a greatest hits basically because their albums have too much filler. The Stones might of had some filler but very few. What I think was right was not including anything from Dirty Work. Which to me is their worst album. I give it 3 stars because their is alot of great stuff here. (where's She's So Cold?). I heard Don't Stop and it is B-side material. Like I said I am a Stones fan but only up to Under Cover of the Night. If your a beginner then yes this is a good introduction. But if you wanna hear some more Rolling Stones (which you will) buy Hot Rocks 1964-1971, Let it Bleed, Stinky Fingers, Exile on Main Street, Goats Head Soup, Some Girls, Emotional Rescue, Tattoo You. That is their best. No filler on these albums."
2,Not Enough Stones for Anyone,"Obviously, Hot Rocks is not for the Stones fanatic. The fanatical fan should acquire all of the Stones' early releases. Those of you who don't care much for the Stones, but want some Stones for your collection will probably be satified with Forty Licks. However, the less than fanatical fan doesn't need 40 Licks at all, he needs more. He should instead buy: Hot Rocks, More Hot Rocks, Jump Back, and then download these song:1. Happy2. Shattered3. Anybody Seen My Baby?4. Hang Fire5. Heart of Stone6. Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)7 The Girl with the Faraway Eyes8. We Love You9. When the Whip Comes Down"
5,Finally - Satisfaction!,"All of the Stones' hits are here, I have been waiting for this.I really had: before this collection was released, in my homeland - New Zealand, I had said to a friend that no one Stones CD was worth buying - that they need to bring out a hits compilation. The very next week this was released, and far exceded my expectations."
1,This has to be a best of?,"Forty licks has marvellous songs (like `Gimme shelter', `You can't always get what you want', `Sympathy for the devil', `Mother's little helper'...), but also really bad ones (like `Emotional rescue', `Mixed emotions', `Undercover of the night', `Shattered', `Don't stop').The first disc is fantastic, missing some classics like `We love you', `Lady Jane' or `As tears go by', but on the whole, it is all right. Disc two, on the other hand, has disgraceful songs from the eighties and nineties. These songs have nothing to do with their earlier work from the sixties, when Mick Jagger used to be a rebel. I really can't believe that there is a song like `Mixed emotions' on a compilation album. Of course there are also great songs on disc 2 like `Start me up', `Brown sugar', `Miss you', `Angie' and `It's only rock 'n' roll', but that's it.The Stones made their best songs in the seventies and sixties... But in the eighties and nineties their game is over... You just have to face it."
3,Caveat Emptor/Copy protection,"I'm no pirate, but I like to download cd's onto my computer, then create a personal favorites package. Well, 40 Licks has copy protection. It allows you to make a copy onto your computer ONCE. I used Windows Media for this purpose, only to find inaccurate song listings. I wanted to put Mixed Emotions, or Start Me Up (can't remember) on my hits cd; it turned out to be Shattered (I don't care for that song). I deleted the album to try recording again on Creative Playcenter, but discovered that you can't do that, you already made your copy. I've never seen this before; thanks, RIAA. Plus, there's filler on Disk 2.A better bet is the Hot Rocks remastered. Maybe they have copy protection, too."
3,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with the sound quality of the songs from 1965/66/67. Although this is supposed to be ""remastered"" the songs, which are in mono, sound terrible. Why wasn't there an indication which tracks are in mono? Why do Beatle cd's from the same time period, even Elvis and Buddy Holly from the late 50's to early 60's sound a whole lot better? What happened to the stereo mixes? ""have you seen your mother baby"" sounds so bad I have to pass over this one. How could the Glimmer Twins release this? Even the Beatles at the BBC was superior to this. perhaps Sir George Martin should have produced this project. Although I do like the music, its the sound quality I am complaining about.Also why couldn't the liner notes provide more information like if a song was a single release, chart position, etc. I suppose the Beatles have spoiled me and set the standard for retrospective packages."
4,MORE LICKS PLEASE,A VERY GOOD COMPILATION BY THE STONES.HOWEVER THERE ARE NUMEROUS SONGS THAT DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT HERE AND THATS WHY I GAVE THIS FOUR STARS INSTEAD OF FIVE.THE DISC IS STILL WORTH GETTING IF YOUR INTERESTED IN THE STONES HISTORY....PICK IT UP.
4,FORTY TONGUES STUCK ON THE ICE,"If you don't know THE ROLLING STONES at all,buy it without fear of being disappointed.As a reminder for the old fans like me and many others,the first disc was already available on the HOT ROCKS collection thirty years ago.All of those songs are so well known by now,we could sing them accapella.The second cd is for me much more interesting,featuring songs from SOME GIRLS and STEEL WHEELS,their two best post EXILE albums but also from lesser albums that features a few good songs each.The importance of this collection is that you get your money's worth.But it should not prevent you from buying the best ROLLING STONES albums:BEGGAR'S BANQUET,LET IT BLEED,STICKY FINGERS,EXILE ON MAIN STEET,SOME GIRLS and STEEL WHEELS.I guess THE GLIMMER TWINS would be proud of my selection of their great cds,but one never knows.After all,the MICK JAGGER you saw in PHILADELPHIA or NEW YORK recently could be a stand in.Buy this."
3,Love the stones,Great collection of the best Rolling Stones songs but some of my very favorites were not on here. Really wish Waiting On A Friend was on it.
5,If you like Stones this is their best songs,Bought this for my husband since he told me he could never find a good compilation of Stones music. He raved about all the music and totally enjoyed it. The cover art is cute too. Great gift!
2,"Said it was new, but clearly not","The Cd was supposed to be brand new but the case was cracked when it came in the mail, and both discs skipped the first time I listened to them. I was very disappointed in this purchase."
3,"You can't always get what you want, but...","...you don't just have to settle for what they give you, either. At the forty-year mark, this was a real opportunity to put the exclamation point on the Stones' unparalleled career. Instead, long-time fans get edited versions of some classics, some signature tunes are missing altogether, and any new fans will be puzzled by the unfocused collection on disc two, which seems lacking any drive or logic to its sequence. (""Brown Sugar"" is here, as expected, but where is the equally-raunchy B-side? There are plenty of omissions that every fan will name.) And prying four new songs into a career retrospective is a naked marketing gimmick. That's not necessarily a horrible thing, but offering first-time-ever edited versions of Stones songs ... gee, whose bright idea was that? Better to pick up the older best-of collections, or the original albums themselves."
5,Shocking Omission!,"Where is ""Rock and a Hard Place?"" (I ask.) There is no reason not to buy this nicely remastered chunk of gold. The old stuff is great, and the new stuff, especially ""Don't Stop,"" is classic too.Finally the U.S. trumps the Brits...who long had access to the 25-song ""Jump Back"" collection."
2,Poor masters of great songs,"It's too bad that those responsible for releasing Stones complilations can't seem to find (or bother to remaster like the Beatles re-releases) Stereo versions of all of their 60's material. Anybody listening to this collection on a good modern system will find some of the early tracks painfull and muddled. Even the later tracks chosen are the edited versions. Uneven releases by those controlling the Stones catalog are common. For example, every track on the Stones UK Aftermath release are in true stereo and sound crystal clear conversly all the songs on both versions of Out of Our Heads were released in mono only (remaster!). Talk about an uneven treatment of a catalog. There are no excuses why the best possible versions of every song could have been included in this release- they haven't, therefore the low rating."
4,You can sometimes get what you want.,"When this collection finally came out, it was sorely needed. The old ""Rewind"" and ""Hot Rocks"" albums didn't quite cut it. The Rolling Stones were and are the greatest rock n' roll band on the planet, whether everyone agrees or not. There is so much classic material here I'm not even going to name off tracks. But look at the tracklist yourself, and realize that almost every one of these songs recalls some time and memory for you, probably a good one, for the past many decades. Now like any collection by any artist, there are faults. Those here are that some songs are edits, noticeable or not, and a handful of still missing hits. It's hard to complain when we get 40 tracks, but I do really miss ""As Tears Go By"", ""Waiting On A Friend"", and ""She's So Cold"". However, the goods obviously far outweigh the bad. In short, if you're looking for your first or only Stones collection, you can't beat ""40 Licks""."
4,Great collection,"This two-CD set shows how good the Rolling Stones were before 1972 and how average they became the past 30 years. They are a great stage act but their music in the past 30 years has been anything but great. That being said, these CDs show a band that reached critical heights, then became a commercial excess. I guess it's difficult to stop the music when the cash register won't stop ringing."
3,"Nice collection, but...","This is a nice low-budget collection of old (and some new) Rolling Stones classics. Nothing more said about the songs that most people interested in music knows very well. But I have some complains about the remastering, and the sound quality in general. I know that I can`t expect takes from the 60`s and early 70`s to sound like a pre 2000 publication (especially not early Stones..), but with todays remastering technologies, I still expect the sound to be less harsh and hollow than which is the case here, of course without losing the ""soul and mood"" in the songs."
2,"uh, couldve been better for the price you pay for this......","Yep, it has almost all of their hits but why 4 new damn songs and a cover of dumbell christine agulera ""jeanie in a bottle? the new songs are pretty depressing. more thought couldve been put to other old hits to use in place of these new tracks. and there is no old classics like ""Rock and a hard place"",""one hit to the body"",""If you cant rock me"",""almost hear you sigh"" and a few others couldve but nope. Get there old cd's instead."
3,Cracked case,"Received CD quickly at a reasonable price, unfortunately this CD was purchased as a Christmas gift and the CD case is cracked."
5,It's all the best from the best,"This album is the kind that ought to be owned by every self-respecting music fan on earth. It's much like the Beatles 1 in that sense. Everything about the stones, who love them or not, are the worlds greatest rock n roll band, always were, and still are, is in this record. The sixties drug-addled grooves, the rockin 70s jams, the disco beat and utterly brilliant ""some girls"" works, the cocky 80s rock, and the few songs that theyve made lately that are really worthwhile. ""saint of me"" which is the best song theyve made since the 70's is a glaring snub, but no matter, this tracklist is impossible to argue with"
3,Unsolved Mystery - The Songlist,"Having grown up with the Stones and having used ""Sticky Fingers"" and other lp's often as the backround music to my life, I recently bought the remastered ""Let It Bleed."" I was very impressed with how well the remastering had been done. There are things heard which have never been heard before without the loss of musicality.So when I saw this CD, I figured why not. The reason why not, is that the song list is just weird and unpalatable. This CD loses the song placement and timing of the original lp by stacking up songs against each other that make no sense if you have listened to the Stones over the years.If you have never really listened to the Stones, this CD would make a great introduction. I'm going to get those remastered lp's that I want and let this CD be the source of the occassional song I can get nowhere else."
4,A great gift,"Having all but the originals from this collection on various other cds made this a continuous pass-over when I would visit record shops. Getting it for Christmas this morning, however, makes it well worth owning. For completists, you get the new stuff, for newbies it is a great overall introduction going up through Bridges to Babylon, and for collectors you get a beautiful softcover booklet with great photos and a brief essay and a very cool four-fold black and white poster of the five original lads that would look fantastic framed and hung on the wall of a Stones fan on your gift list.There are arguments to be made for questionable inclusions and objectionable exclusions, but that is the case with any hits collection. I look at it as a very reasonably priced gift and I think the lucky ones who find it under their tree will agree. Merry Christmas!"
3,Buyer beware,"Between the mono versions on disc one and the edited versions on disc two, think twice before you buy this cd. The song selection is ok, but why not use the stereo versions of Paint It Black and Satisfaction, for example? If there was something mentioned on the packaging, ok... but the record companies continue to play their unfortunate little games. We need consumer protection laws passed to stop this ongoing non-information-labeling scam."
3,Should Have Been A Four CD Set,"This release could have easily been a four disc set. There are far too many songs not included that should be there. In addition, I think the packaging in the 12x12 limited edition set leaves a lot to be desired. You get a skimpy 12x12 booklet and a decent poster. Instead of housing the two CD's in jewel cases, they slide into two slots in the bottom of the box. What were they thinking?If I were to do it again, I'd go for the standard issue."
1,Same old stuff repackaged.,"My gosh oh golly these songs have shown up on a gazillion collections and they picked the old tired warhorses, like Street Fighting Man and Gimme Shelter which are great songs but have been played to death and have been on all those Hot Rocks collections. You don't need them. You need ""Sucking in the Seventies"" You need Memo From Turner from ""Performance"" You need ""All Down The Line and Soul Survivor"" from Exile on Main Street. Not this stuff. The garage rock of the Hives, The Strokes and The Vines find their way back to Exile, not the big glossy overproduced stuff on this very standard and dull collection. Whoever put it together was striving to be mediocre."
5,Stone the Haters,"The Rolling Stones made rock main-stream, transforming it from its bluesy roots to what it is today. These guys are the original rock 'n rollers, and set the standard for all rock acts from then on. Everyone like Fred and Bernard are just being trolls. They know that they are worthless humans-beings, and find joy in making fun of the roots of rock just to piss people off and make themselves feel important. And apparently the only negative adjectives in their vocabulary are ""suck"" and ""crap"". Wow, ""they suck, and are crap"", great review, moron. Go to school, learn about the English language, and stop being leeches, you ignorant pricks. I wouldn't mind if negative reviews are constructive, but when its these one setence blurbs designed to lower the products rating, that just pisses me off. Hope you get plenty of hate-mail, you earned it. Anyway, The Stones roll and sure as hell rock the hell out of the music scene, to this day."
2,Such a disappointment.,"After having had it for a couple of years, I have these thoughts...(2007)Well, maybe not an absolute waste. I still have it, I still listen to it occasionally. I would've been happier if the technical quality of the recordings were better.(Back when I first bought it)An absolute waste of the $29.00 that I paid for it. Many of the older songs are very poorly re-mastered. It is easy to hear all sorts of noise. ""Honky Tonk Woman"" is made pathetic by all the background hiss. The newer songs sound like nothing has been done to them at all. Some of the more popular cuts sound muddy like they've come off a vinyl record album that has been played too many times. This album reminded me of why I never got all that hot and bothered by the Rolling Stones in the first place."
4,leave off the new......add more old,"Well, I love it, but I re-recorded it and burned it and added ""Time is on My Side"" PLUS ""Dandelion"". The Stones have always dissed Dandelion in most of their compilations, and they did here. I wish they would have left off the new, and truly made this the definitive greatest hits collection that it could have been. Then maybe they would not have had to edit so much. But, all in all, some of the best music ever made."
2,Suckered In,"Abko has had a very strange way of promoting their re-mastering of the Stones catalog. On the initial release of the individual albums, they released a dual layer disk with SACD on one layer and regular cd on another. On the outside of the cd package, however, they made no mention that they were dual layers! You had to open the package to finally read about the dual layers! I got 5 of these and loved the sound. Not wanting to buy all 27 reissues, I next opted for ""40 Licks."" There was no mention on the outside of the disk that this was a dual layer disk either so I bought it, opened it and found a SINGLE layer disk with ok fidelity and edited songs. What's going on here? Indeed I was suckered."
4,Can't get enough of Stones,"Great compilation. The 4 new songs make it more interesting.I know you can't fill everyone's favorites in two discs butthis is a very good selection. Still I miss the great ""Hangfire"" and there's a song called ""Live wire"" that could havebeen included since it only appeared in one Stones' livealbum from 1991 and it's a great song."
3,Why omit the best ?,"Having been a Rolling Stones devotee since the Sixties, I'm delighted the boys are still belting it out to sellout audiences old and new, and was impressed when this collection was issued.But WHY is the opportunity to present a new generation with their BEST squandered on some frankly mediocre recordings while leaving out two of their greatest rock and blues tracks ? Listeners will have to go elsewhere to find ROUTE 66 and LITTLE BY LITTLE - both from their first album: ""The Rolling Stones"" ( ""England's Newest Hitmakers"" in the USA ), and both showcases for Bill Wyman's rolling bass guitar runs .( But then when did the record companies ever produce a ""best of"" collection that really deserved the title ? )"
4,"Good Music, but still lacks my favorite song","I think this CD is awesome! It has music from the Stones from every time period. I would give this CD 5 stars if it included my favorite song, ""She's So Cold"". She's So Cold is the song that inspired me to listen to the Stones."
1,YIKES!!! This is really bad!,"When I heard this I couldn't believe my ears : YIKES!!!!This is really BAD BAD music, very BAD and UNINSPIRED.It is just a bunch of UGLY DUMB sounds and the guitarrists can't even play and the drummer sounds like Terry from my class who had ADHD and the girl who sings sounds like she has to go potty all the time.I like music but this is oreful!"
1,What a lousy singer!,"Mick Jagger is living proof that you can be one of the most untalented singers out there, yet still be at the top of the music industry.I remember hearing ""Its Only Rock n Roll"" on the radio when I was about 4 years old and thinking that the singer on the radio had the flu. Was that phlegm caught in his throat? Today I realize I was mistaken. Mick Jagger wasn't sick when ""Its only rock n roll"" was recorded--the man simply has a horrible, unmusical voice. He can't sing. His voice sounds like complete $hit. Why am I the only one who will admit this? His voice sounds like a tobacco smoker who has smoked 3 packs a day for 30 years hacking up phlegm! My god, what a $hitty voice he has."
1,Possibly the worst album ever.,"Dirt weak and old as such. Talk about unoriginal, overly-influenced drivel."
1,The Greatest Rock Band In The World?,"What? They arn't the best rock band in the world. The only rocksongs that rock are Start Me Up and Shattered. What's the point?They used to play punk back in the 60's. They were never the best rock band in the world. Or maybe they are, they are a greatband, but they are way better than the Who. The Beatles suck!"
2,YUK! YUK! YUK!,"I do not like the Rolling Stones!Sure, they were very influential (that's the reason for the 2nd star), but they, to my ears, R NOT ROCK 'N' ROLL!Get The Kinks, The Who, Split Enz, Roxy Music, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Led Zeppelin, Green Day, Sonic Youth, Nirvana... the list just goes on for some REAL music"
3,Some Good/Some Bad,After listening to this whole set- I have come to the conclusion that I do not care for the Rolling Stones' earlier music (60's). I would have been better off to buy a disc with later music on it.
3,CD one is great! CD two should've been left in the crate!,"Wouldn't this have been better if all the ""best of"" had been used?Where is 'Before They Make Me Run'?OR Heartbreaker?OR 2000 Light Years From Home?OR Dandelion?OR Dead Flowers? and a few others........ Instead of four new licks why not the four known hits?CD one has just about everything you would ever want on a Stones greatest hits disc!CD two fizzles out quick. Maybe the 80's, 90's and 00's should've been left out? I mean that is a time when Stones fans had to wonder what in the world happened to The Rolling Stones!In other words, the song selection could have been a whole lot better.Suggestions:Maybe a 60's thru the 70's two disc set?Then a 80's thru the 90's and 00's two disc set?Both sets should have the CHOICE picks!That way Stones fans are not forced to buy what they do not want.Skip this one -- UNLESS you have NEVER heard the Stones music.I am guessing that most people have already heard of this band.Hope this helps?!"
2,Avoid this CD at all costs,"Whoever greenlighted this ""compilation"" at Virgin ought to be fired. On disc 1, we get the MONO version of (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction instead of the much better sounding stereo version that was included on the European version of Hot rocks.On disc 2, the following songs are presented in EDITED versions:Miss You, Fool To Cry and Beast of Burden.This should have been at least a three disc set with ALL songs unedited and in stereo. As Gerry Rafferty once sang ""Can I have my money back?"""
2,"Good Compilation, But Still Missing One Crucial Song","Being a fan of the Stones for quite a long time, I won't need to be buying this collection since I already have every song on it in one form or another. For people who want to get their first taste of the Stones, this is a good introduction - except for one crucial failing that marred the previous HOT ROCKS greatest hits collections as well: the exclusion of the song ""Monkey Man"" from the LET IT BLEED album. This song is incredible, a classic without which your Rolling Stones collection is not complete. Other than that, however, this is a very solid introduction to the Stones' best work."
4,Good......but not great,"Basically there are a few notable exceptions, sway, dead flowers etc and they have included some very average tracks, she's a rainbow and others.However the new track, ""dont stop"" is amazing with some smooth guitar hooks.Additionally, the production is of a high quality which makes it worthwhile buying, ie a lot better sound than ""hot rocks""The first time I listened to the CD was on the 40 highway running from saudi arabia border through kuwait and up to iraq; awesome driving cd!"
4,Not bad but mIssing several Songs,"The fact that they did not include any songs off ""Dirty Work"" is a drag....while Dirty Work was not there best effort by far, it still is a body of work that needs to be addressed..""Harlem Shuffle"" was a great song as was ""Winning Ugly"" I assume Mick and Keith didnt want to add these songs because it reminded them of the little spat they had in the 80s... hmmm get over it boys.... dissapointing, will stick with Hot Rocks CD...."
2,Good CD,"It has 40 good songs, but they are all cut-down in some ways.I'm putting this disc to the side, I want to hear full length songs.It's sad, because all these songs are excellent. I'm sure that ""The Rolling Stones"" wouldn't like this either."
1,Remember KTel albums anyone?,"The song selection is great, the editing of songs to make them fit on a CD is outrageous (especially considering that the CD has plenty of room for the uncut versions). I do not recommend this collection for anyone who wants to hear these great classics in their entirety."
3,Could have been better,"I hate to give the Stones 3 stars, should be maybe 3 and a half stars. You get a lot of the ""hits"" although I agree with other reviewers that there are a few songs that could have been left off this release to make room for some better selected material that normally doesn't make a ""greatest hits"" release. Any ""greatest hits"" release will have pretty much the same lineup of songs, so why not take advantage of a 40 song cd and include some of the ""other"" hits that never seem to make it on a ""greatest hits"" release?"
3,Great stuff... and crrrrap!,"The selection on the first CD is impeccable, while the second CD is half filler. Trust me: If you go with a few of the Stones' best individual albums, you'll be happier. A true career-spanning ""greatest hits"" compilation has yet to be released."
1,forty licks/rolling stones,"the discs arrived but when inserted in cd player would not accept showing ""no disk"",I then tried playing on my computer,again would not recognise,once I did get a responce of garbled music,so I am really pissed off."
2,GREAT REMASTERING HORRIBLE PACKAGING,"Well just check out my other on line Reviews about the 'stones and you'll understand more what I mean: they've done it again with this one....The remastering efforts like all of that with SACDs is fantastic. However chopping down the songs was uncalled for. Even though I recommend this CD set for a person just being introduced to the group (especially the younger crowd), but even then the Stones could have done something better. 'Don't Stop' is a pretty good tune but you can tell they just did it quickly...no major thought there...the other new tunes aren't up for consideration."
3,Its missing some good licks........,"Who determined what songs would be included here? Where is Time is on my side,Tell me,Heart of Stone,and for goodness sakes,where is As tears go by? I have to give disc 1 5 stars even with these glaring ommisions,disc 2 1 1/2 stars,as about everything from the stones latter years is pretty lame... 3 stars total."
3,It's a Great Time to Be a Silver Stone!,"You're only as old as you feel, and the Stones prove it. Don't let those Marianas-Trench-deep wrinkles fool you - they're as vital and spry as any under-60 whippersnapper! Who says getting old means slowing down?! Not the Stones! Heck, where can I buy tickets for 2025's ""Stones on Ice"" tour, featuring Mick, Keef, and the other lads in their cryogenic preservation vats?"
4,Love it!,"I am enjoying my CD. It arrived quickly in a padded envelop. However, the case was cracked & the case was of poor quality. Thus, I put it in 2 of my old CD cases. Everything was great except the case!"
5,Forty Licks licked The Hell out of me,"Considering that I was born in 1981, I am not a music geek, and I do not find Mick Jagger remotely attractive, I love this collection of hits from the Rolling Stones because it encompasses all of the great hits. Some of the hits are: have you seen my baby, start me up, angie, jumping jack flash, gimme shelter, you can't always get what you want, under my thumb, sympathy for the devil, and many more. I love to sing along to this collect and it is a shame that it is being discontinued because this is the perfect collect for someone on a budget! Hope the old guys keep on rockin' it because their music makes me shake my booty! The Rolling Stones are to me what the Beatles would be to everyone else."
4,Satisfaction.,"Before this was released, the 21 track ""Hot Rocks"" was the best collection of their music, and this blows that out of the water. It's hard to beat 40 remastered ""hits"" in one package. If you're looking for your first, or only ""Rolling Stones"" disc, this is it. Almost all the classics are here. I actually enjoy the four new songs too, but I would have taken just one, if this also included ""Dead Flowers"", ""Waiting on a friend"", and especially ""She's so Cold"". I doubt this, or any ""best of"" will be perfect for anybody, but it's as close as it gets. These guys STILL put on an amazing show too."
4,Maybe it should be called 40 Quicks..,"In order to fit 40 songs, the second CD has a lot of single edits, or worse, very early fade outs on ""Emotional Rescue"" and ""It's Only Rock and Roll"". Still, it's a quality collection, and it's the only place to get the original mono 45 version (with different vocals) of ""Ruby Tuesday""."
2,Don't waste your money,"I got this as a gift as I already own a lot of their stuff.The remasters sound great but song selection is a bit curious. The four new ""vital"" songs are a waste of space. Take 'em out and give me ""Midnight Rambler"" or even ""Harlem Shuffle."" Does anyone need to hear ""Anybody seen my baby?"" ever again?We also get the climax edited out of ""Emotional Rescue"". Thanks guys.I love and respect the Stones, but this is simply corporate shilling at it's finest. Buy Hot Rocks,if you need a greatest hits. I also recommend Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main Street, Some Girls and Tattoo You. As far as their later work, if you can find something you like, get it from Limewire.Keith sums it up best with the last track, ""Losing my touch.""Well put."
3,20 songs 2 many,"The Stones were well before my time...I am 31. But, I was going thru all 40 songs...and I find more than half to be disposable. Do yourself a favor and go to ITUNES and download the 15 or so tracks worth having....How these guys are still selling out stadiums is beyond me..."
5,"The Best Of ""The Strolling Bones!!!""","I do find it very sad when ageing rock and roll stars don't know when to quit. My least favourite song on this CD would have to be 'Start Me Up"" which does not refer to Mick Jagger's inablity to get going but does contain the Immortal Lyrics ""You make an old man cry"" or words similar to that effect.One does not have to be a Rhodes Scholar who Majored in English Literature to produce such eloquence.I can never understand the words when Mick Jagger is singing.Unforunately Jagger's antics on stage are now a parody and caricature of what used to be a good impersonation of jaded , rebellious youth.These guys play Rock and Roll but they are PURE ESTABLISHMENT through and through. As the man once said ""If you don't walk the walk , don't talk the talk"". I give this album 5 stars because I sold it to the guy who lives down the street for a profit."
2,STONES SHOULD JUST HANG IT UP,"I use to love this group,but as I get older they have been a big embarrassment and a enemy of mine.Jagger is the most vain and conceited S.o.b's in the business.This band has been coasting for years!!The last decent Stones album was 'Tattoo You',23 years ago!I use to really be a fan.I'd eagarily wait in anticipation for their latest records,whose days are long gone.This is a aging,uninspired rock band,most of it's members grand fathers! Just going thru the motions.This latest greatest hits collection,one of many, is to make a quick buck,with today's generation.Why didn't the put these songs in chronilogical order? The 4 new tunes are nuthin special.Buy this if you are a casual fan,most of the groups albums early albums are great.I still listen to the vinyl albums on my turntable!If you are a big fan,I sugest getting the 2 HOT ROCKS anthologies,or the DECCA YEARS set.I also have the JUMP BACK cd,which collects their latter days hits."
2,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"Far from definitive, FORTY LICKS is little more than a generic grab-bag of past hits (and a few misses), hastily slapped together to promote yet another Stones tour. It's telling that many of the tracks omitted from this collection -- ""Harlem Shuffle,"" ""Waiting on a Friend,"" ""Almost Hear You Sigh,"" and, most of all, the stellar ""One Hit (To the Body),"" are a great deal more interesting than colourless tunes such as ""Shattered,"" and the truly insipid ""Undercover of the Night,"" both of which were deemed necessary inclusions here. And just who had the bright idea to include a cover of Christina Aguilera's ""Genie in a Bottle"" as a ""hidden"" track??!! Kids, don't try this at home!"
1,MUCH more scratched than originally claimed,"threw out one of the discs a month after i got it. said it was in good condition, but it was actually a mess"
4,Could have been perfect for me......,"For a casual Stones fan like myself, this collection is more than sufficient. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it had the stereo version of ""Satisfaction"" and included ""As Tears Go By"" and ""Stupid Girl"" but we know they do that all the time so we'll buy the other collections, right?"
4,A few licks short...,"I can't wait to hear:* Heart of Stone* Out of Time* the Last Time* Play with FireOh wait a minute these great Rolling Stones songs are not included. Well at least they didn't try to slam some new crap on us to make the 2-CD set seem ""essential"".Oh wait, there are some crappy new songs on this.Hey why not drop the three new songs!Noboby gives a rat's butt about the Stones after 1980 anyways."
5,Need proof the Stones are the world's greatest rock band?,"If so, you need only purchase this album, which is a superb introduction to the band's work. Sure, it leaves off some great tracks, but that's understandable considering the disc covers 38 years of Stones tunes--both the ABKCO and Rolling Stones Records/Virgin eras. ""Hot Rocks"" and ""More Hot Rocks"" would suit you better if you're only interested in the '60s-era Stones, but for a career-spanning collection I can find little fault with this 2-disc set.As for the new songs, I don't think they'll end up being classics, but they're not half bad. My favorite is actually the Keith Richards-sung ""Losing My Touch,"" the album closer. Do I detect a touch of Mark Knopfler in the vocals? It is actually quite atypical for the Stones, which may be why I like it so much.At any rate, this is a fine collection, and it's great to hear these tracks in their remastered form."
4,The best stones compilation..,The only complaint are the edited versions but they dont distract the fact that this compilation is One rock classic after another.
5,As a Greatest Hits... is as good as it could be,"My father had purchased this greatest hits when I first got into the stones back in the 90s. As a greatest hits goes, they couldn't have done much better. It captures all of their widely commercial songs, and will definitely keep you entertained for a while. However for those of you who want to know what ""all this hype is on the Rolling Stones"", I'd reccomend ""Exile On Mainstreet"". I know I'm not being original by saying it's their best album, but it has the cleanest flow from song to song, and the whole album has this feel to it. It's also amazing because not that many hits came from the album, except of course Tumbling Dice, Happy, and Angie, but all of the 18 songs on the album are great.So in conclusion, if you want to hear just the hits, buy this, but if you really want to know why the Stones are one of the best rock and roll bands of all time, buy their better albums, primarily Exile on Mainstreet."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great!!!","I hated the first disc! The first disc was awfully terrible!The only good songs on the first disc was Street Fighting Man,Satisfaction, Jumping Jack Flash, You Can't Always Get WhatYou Want, & Honky Tonk WomeN. A lot of the songs on the firstdisc didn't rock hard enough and I coudn't hear the music good.That's what makes the Rolling Stones not the best. There are waymany better bands with compilations that are better than this.Maybe the second disc may have a tad bit better songs. StartMe Up, Shattered, & Love is Strong are still the best songs onthis CD because I can hear the music great and they rock hard too. Tumbling Dice, and Brown Sugar are also classics too. I willlisten to the second disc and edit this review soon when I likedthe second disc. Enjoy."
2,Stones Are Overrated,"Feel sorry for people so in love with the stones. Led, Jimi, ect. they're all better. Wild horses is their only song with downloading"
2,This band is highly overrated,"I never liked the Stones and I never will. Their music is primitive, they don't have any musical skills at all and I really don't understand why they are so succesfull. Their hits would have had enough place on one cd, there is nearly 20 songs that I never have heard before !These guys should consider themself lucky to have such a success whitout any reasons, they are poor musicians, poor composers making boring music.The Beatles were far better !"
5,The Story Comes Together,This is the second volume of the collected Xenozoic Tales. Thisvolume delves far more deeply into the world as well as develops a greater plot.Jack Tenrec is revealed as being an Old School Mechanic and as such is a protector of the rules that should help prevent another cataclysm. But there are those who feel these rules are beyond usefulness. The City in the Sea falls under new rule and Jack becomes an outlaw and travels to the lands of the Warhoon.This volume ends with a cliffhanger but notes from the author assure us that there will be more stories in this series. A very enjoyable read for any fans of dinosaurs and adventure.
2,buy the cd forget the dvd,"The music is good, the ""stage"" is crowded, it actually reminds me of a garage band. I actually cant bring myself to watch this, I use as a ""cd"" while I watch sports on tv. Extremely low budget production, if there is a live audience I havent seen them. Do yourself a favor, enjoy Glass Hammer on cd, you DONT want to see these guys live. There are MANY more negative things I could say about presentation. I wish I had the cd to bring on road trips in the car. Music 4 stars, video 0 stars."
1,Ugh,"I watched this one on fast foward x8...The lead character is dead and already in Hell, the end. Save your money, give it to a charity but don't spend it on this stinker."
3,"a major flaw, but...","On one of the first uses the locking pin broke, and it was so poorly designed that I don't see how it wouldn't break for everyone that needs to tighten it to a window pretty securely. I was on vacation, but got an idea to replace the part with a sturdier makeshift pin and it performed its job very well. I would give this a 1 rating but outside that issue it functioned well, but if you're not into a challenge when it breaks, don't buy."
2,my entry point to ben harper,"In a word: tired. This is my first Ben Harper cd and I have found it to be uninspired and without much originality. Upon my initial listen, the first three songs hold real promise. They simply don't hold up to repeated listens. Ben's music is all over the place which may not be a bad thing, but it reeks of so many other artists that have come before that I just don't buy it. I don't doubt a bit that Ben is very talented. However, this album sounds very weak when it's held up against the many artists he aspires to sound like here."
3,pretty good set,Ben Harper brings back His trademark Sound&vibe here.The Bob Marley&Bob Dylan Influences are there as well.Vocally I've never been that big a fan of His Voice but this time He Sounds better than He has for me.I dig His Guitar Playing&Live He really rocks.His Songwriting is better balanced this time around as well.I enjoyed the vibe He is bringing here for a good duration of this set.
2,lame and boring cd,"three good songs - 1st one and the last 2...now, i love ben harper's previous albums - i even really liked burn to shine - but this is a poor, miserable, commercialized, soulless and boring effort. what [stinks] the most is that ben has session guitarists playing on this album. i always liked him for his own guitar style, and it's sad that he (or maybe his producer) doesn't have faith in the uniqueness and originality of his guitar work. can anyone imagine if jimmy hendrix had asked some schmo to play guitar for him on any of his albums? highly unrecommended. (having said that, i'm going to see him live this weekend - hope he plays lot's of old stuff...)"
1,Liberty is more important than profit,"First of all, let me say the music on Ben's latest won't disappoint. It's the same genre skipping, inspirational stuff we've come to expect from him. But I didn't expect Ben Harper to sell out to the lawyers at his record company. His latest CD is embedded with EMI's ""copy protection"" coding, which prevents the purchaser of this CD from saving the music to your computer's hard drive, ripping it to an iPod, or creating a back up copy for yourself (all perfectly legal activities, by the way). Yah, sure there's ways to break the code, surf the web long enough and you'll find a way. But that's not the point. And if this came from some shallow, money grubbing bubble gum musician I could accept it. But from the guy who used to sing about giving power to the people? What happened to the real Ben Harper? What a disappointment."
2,Disappointed,"Too much from the past leaving nothing for the future. The cd is overproduced and unoriginal.The songwriting is amazing as usual. If you are a disapionted fan check out upandcoming bands such as: Iron & Wine, The Velvet Teen, Postcard Audio, Matt Pond PA."
4,Harpers still got it,"I was well pleased when i heard this album was coming out. In the past i always seem to be disapointed when my favourite artists have released another album, i think i expect to much. I am pleased to say this album was not one of them (which i decided after the first 10 seconds of the first song). Although not his best it is still a reall good album. One thing i like about ben is his ability to change styles which this album shows, however this album could be said to over do it. One other fault it that it is over produced lacking the raw guitar and vocals of ben.Although less folky and bluesy than his older material this is still a very enjoyable album.Over all it is possibly more mainstream than others which can serve to make it easyer to listen to."
3,Maybe not as strong as some earlier discs,"I'm not quite sold on this disc after about five listens-- there don't seem to be any standout tracks, just a lot of typical Ben throughout (not that that's a bad thing). I wasn't too high on Burn to Shine and I'm not sure that this album is much of an improvement. Just sort of standard all the way through. Worth buying if you're a Harper fan, though. Just perhaps not his best work. I don't like what he did with ""My Own Two Hands""-- he turned a beautiful outro, which you can hear on Live From Mars, I believe, after Burn One Down, into a jammy, reggae type song. Not my cup of tea. Again, a decent album but nothing noteworthy."
3,Not Harper's Best,"Ben Harper is an amazing musician, especially live. Diamonds on the Inside has a few good tracks, but just as many poor ones. Harper's earlier albums contain more thoughtful lyrics, and are better overall. After Ben's last two works, Live from Mars and Burn to Shine, it's hard not to be dissapointed by his new efforts."
4,HItting his stride now,"My favorite ben harper album has been 'fight for your mind' but I think that's being challenged with this new one. I thought ben got a little stale with his last few releases, falling into a tired formula that fell between souful wannabe and sell-out lenny kravitz. I've listened to the last few albums but never heard anything good enough to make me buy. This new album turns things around. He mixes styles gracefully and creates melodic, soulful songs. I strongly recommend this album. For those of you who have been frustrated with his last few albums, come on back. You'll want to own this album."
5,"Soulful, but fun!","I know what I like. And I like this album, particularly the first 3 tracks, but only because I am having a hard time not listening to them to get to the rest. I have read other reviews in which this album was criticized for being ""inconsistent"" or eclectic, but that is a closed mind speaking. This album reminds me, and has been compared to both here and in magazine reviews, in that respect of Paul Simon's Graceland. It's range is why it is such a good album."
3,Would Have Purchased...,"I wonder how many sales they lost...Like me, by putting that copy protect crap on the cd?Pretty stupid considering (We,the people who are trying to do things ""The right way"") have to jump through hoops to get/play their music legally, while the others don't worry about it at all.The Music is good...Would have been 4 stars for the content....But when it contains ""booby traps""...They can keep it."
2,a surprisingly lackluster album,"I consider myself to be a big fan of Ben Harper, have all of his albums and love his live shows. However, this album was a major disappointment. The fact that it deviates from the jamming style of his live performances is not the deciding factor; compared with his other works, it lacks originality in theme, lyrics, and style and simply sounds disjointed. Even more disappointing is the song ""Touch From Your Lust,"" an excellent song live but one which sounds terribly amateurish and botched on the album. If you haven't heard the live version of this song you're missing out. Though not necessarily a bad thing, this album is not characteristic of Harper's usual work, and I recommend any of his other albums over this one."
3,So difficult to rate it!,"Well, I must confess: I'm a great fan of Ben, and to me everything he does is magic. This time it's different. It must be said that ""Diamonds On The Inside"" is a great album, for the complexity and the refinement of the sounds, but still it doesn't like me as well as ""Welcome To The Cruel World"" or ""Fight For Your Mind"" and i think it's just because of this ""mountain of sounds"" which are really well played, of course, but are too many. I used to love (and I do love now) the more simple side of Ben, songs palyed with few instruments and, above all, not electronic instruments (keyboards, synthesizers, etc.). In spite of all that, this album is very good and surely much more better than any other lp since the beginning of the year up to now.P.S. Go watching Ben Harper live if you can, he's amazing, one of the greatest musician of these times."
1,Oh my God!,"Oh my God! I mean, some guys invited me to this party and they were all drinking and laughing and yelling and then this music started playing and everyone was yelling and drinking and cheering. But really, I mean, I just didn't see what all the fuss was about. It was like everyone was laughing and cheering and yelling and drinking just for the sake of laughing and cheering and yelling and drinking. Oh my God, I think everybody likes the same stuff just because everybody else likes the same stuff and everybody else likes the same stuff. I mean, like, am I an individual or just some arbitrary point in the giant mass of society. What am I? Where am I? Does evolution lead towards one or many?"
5,"Hey, try and accept the fact that he's maturing.","This album rocks. More upbeat than his past efforts. Definitely not ""Fight For Your Mind"", but come on he can't play the same stuff forever. Must be Jack Johnson wearin' off on him! I really like the funkier approach. Anyway, give this cd a try, you'll like it. Oh yeah, Pres. Bush gives goat!Booyah!"
3,Seldom sparkling,"Harper's roots-rock was starting to atrophy and show generic influence, but still guarantees the disc is not dismissed by a decent number of sincerely rendered compositions."
1,Bummer...,"I second the comment from M. S. Hillis. The copy protection on the new ben harper cd means I won't be buying it. Further, if you go to the virgin website and try to leave feedback your message is not accepted. I guess that explains why they never get any complaints...I simply hope this is not a problem that will occur with all virgin releases - if it is, guess I'll have to listen to different labels."
1,BORING,"BEN HARPER BEING A VERY TALENTED MUSICIAN SURPRISED ME WITH A HORRIBLE RECORD MELANCOLIC, BORING AND DEPRESSIVE.THE RECORD DOES NOT SOUND GOOD IS BASED ON A SEARCH FOR RITHYMS SUCH AS REGGAE AND ROCK BUT NOT CONVINCED SOMETIMES EVEN LOOKS LIKE A BAD LENNY KRAVITZ COPY."
1,ben harper- diamonds on the inside,This album is a total disappointment. His last studio album was excellent all the way through and I was hoping for the same with Diamonds on the Inside. Apparently Ben didn't try too hard with this one. The only good song on the disk is When it's gone. One good song doesn't make a good album. All the rest sound either over produced or hastily written. If the lyrics are any good the music is horrible or vice-versa. It sounds like Ben sat out the studio session and let Lenny Kravitz take over. ...
5,Ben Harper with another stunning release,"Ben Harper is a master musician who is able to blend many different styles and make them his own. This album, in my opinion, is his best. Over the years Ben has been refining his style. This is his most upbeat album with the widest musical styles represented. His muscial background is in folk music but his music has evolved into a blend of folk, blues, country, rock, and funk. Its very fun to listen to, not to mention deeply moving and spiritual. Another oustanding point for Ben Harper's music is his strict attention to his lyrics. Ben is one of those artist who truly believes that music can change the world. A listener can pick up on this immediately through the complex and beautifully crafted lyrics. If you are looking for a singer/songwriter whose music truly elevates the bar for modern music, then check out this album. It is definately worth a look."
2,Disappointing listen.,"Ben Harper is much hyped but after taking the plunge and listening to this album I was very disappointed. Harper's thin and whiny voice is probably the worst aspect, but the songwriting is insipid and repetitive, the arrangements standard off-the-shelf fare, and the lyrics trite. I'm sorry, but Harper is another derivative sound-alike and lacks the talent and originality to interest me. I'll give him a second-star for the admittedly competent musicianship, however.For all those complaining about the copy protection of the CD, I borrowed it from a friend and ripped it to MP3 using MusicMatch 10 with no problems whatsoever - in fact I only became aware of the copy protection much later while reading these reviews."
2,ok,"The first song on this album is great, but I felt like I heard it before from Bob Marley. The second song is annoying and repeatative, the third song did nothing for me. The fourth is boring and the 5th is a good slow sad song. That is all I heard and from that information I gathered Ben ain't nothing to really listen to. There are better artists out there that have a better sound than he is trying to achieve. Like Lenny Kravitz."
3,"Not bad, but lacks focus","I'm a fan of Harper's earliest albums, and I have to confess that I found this disc somewhat disappointing. Yes, Ben does dip his toes in the waters of many different genres, but this diversity seems somewhat contrived. It also diminishes the overall cohesion of the album. I still enjoy his singing and generally find the lyrical content on ""Diamonds"" to work well, but his composition seems diluted at some points and riddled with affectations at others. There are definitely worthwhile tunes on this album, but as a whole I don't find it as compelling, sincere, or heartfelt as ""Fight For Your Mind"" and ""Welcome to the Cruel World."""
2,"Frustrating, to say the least","I purchased this DVD player a week ago and find watching movies a very frustrating endeavor. This machine refuses to play some DVDs; abruptly stops an hour or so into the movie; and locks up randomly. When it does play a DVD, the picture quality is very good as is the sound. I attempted to contact customer support but was foiled by the inability to speak to a live person. They refer you to the RCA.com website which is also useless. If you wish to talk to someone, they refer you to a non-tollfree number. Having had many GE products in my five decades, I guess I expected a better product and at least customer support for one's questions. Now I am looking for a better quality DVD player and one which also offers customer support."
1,Common Problems,"It looks like there is a common bug on the chip in this machine. I bought a DGE100NA at Circuit City so I could play a VCD a friend sent me - and because the Apex DVD player I had could not read the VCD, even though it was supposed to be able to. The GE was able to play the VCD.This DVD player does NOT resume properly from Pause. But I've found a work-around. When you are ready to resume, press the Pause button and immediately press Stop. Then press play and the movie will USUALLY start from the place where you paused. If you try to resume by just pressing Pause, the unit locks up, and as the others have said, the ONLY way to get it to re-start is to pull the power plug - even the Power On/Off button is frozen.The fact that it sometimes also randomly starts movies in the middle is another annoyance. This unit will PLAY a DVD, but it is sadly lacking when it comes to reliable functionality."
2,It's fine when it works...,"...and that's precisely the problem: it doesn't work very well. From reading other reviews, I see I'm not alone. When it does work, the picture and sound are great. It worked fine for about 2 or 3 years after I bought it, then it started freezing up every so often. It got more and more frequent and is now bad enough that watching a DVD from start to finish is practically impossible. Sometimes it freezes completely so that it won't respond to the remote or buttons on the front panel. It's been like this for quite a while. It has trouble reading some discs that work fine in other players. I recently cleaned the lens very carefully, but it made no difference. I expected more than 2 or 3 years worth of trouble-free use, and I really didn't use it often. I highly doubt that this unit is in production anymore, but if you come across one, whether it be new in the box or used, don't pay too much for it."
1,A complete piece of garbage,"I have 2 of these and have had issues with both. The first one worked fine for a while, and then started developing a habit of failing to read the discs an hour of so into the film. The second one worked fine for a while, but then it started freezing and unfreezing in the middle of movies. Sometimes it freezes completely. It's unresponsive to the buttons even when it does work, just a unreliable frustrating product. Avoid this."
5,Tutto Mozart - Bryn Terfel,"As was expected, Bryn Terfel's rendition of the Mozart arias is superb. A specific mention should be made of his flawless diction in both German and Italian. Terfel belongs in the category of truly great artists not only singers. Every lover of Mozart and great singing should buy this CD."
4,Okkk,"Now i really loved the music in the film, it was great. Amarjeet role was very good in the film.There were many unwanted twists and turns in the story. which made it more boring. however if someone's a Amarjeet fan, please go ahead and watch it."
2,not as good as previous efforts,i agree with sandra's review. i was hoping for another heatseeker or something even more techno in flavor. This is just mostly light dance like Raze. The remixes are great. almost sold this cd but it is so hard to find good christian techno that i kept it for the remixes.
4,Really Cool Dance Music,"When I bought this cd I knew that the WWMT was a dance group but I didn't know what the music sounded like and so I just bought it. Now I think It is a really cool dance cd that just makes you wanna... Dance! The First Song, Frantik, is sorta Jazzy but still good to dance to. The Franik and Truth Remixs are really good to dance to too. I like # 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,11 and 12. They are really good songs and they have good lyrics that talk about the lord. I like most of the album but some songs aren't that much good to dance to, but give it a try and buy this cd!"
5,Possibly the most important book you can read,"This is a book that every thinking person should read. It is a difficult book to read and I recommend reading through the glossary several times before even attempting the text itself. When you stumble over a passage and cannot totally comprehend it in your mind, just go ahead and see if things aren't clearer after a few more pages. Whatever you do, don't give up. This book can open the world to you."
5,Sleep Throughout the Night,"This amino acid-low carbohydrate product was recommended by my ND. It relaxes me about 30 minutes before sleep and helps me sleep longer throughout the night. No harmful side effects. No drowsiness. I've recommended it to others, including clients, who have also had good results. We all need deeper sleep to heal so we can be ready for the challenges of the next day."
4,Works,I take this to help me sleep. 2 tablets is all I need and I have a good night sleep with no problems waking up. Worth adding to your routine.
5,It works,The product works as it should. A nice touch is the dark plastic container. This stuff will go bad if left in the sunlight.
4,Works quite well,"Purchased this product to verify what I already knew, one or more head gaskets were blown. Product worked as advertised and clearly indicated leaking head gaskets."
4,Solid collection of synth pop songs,"This album consists of solid songs and playing ability. I remember ""Broken Wings"" was played on the radio all the time back when this album was released. I've had this album since around '92 and have always been impressed with it. I like the way they imcorporate and used the synth on the songs. Don't Slow Down, Into My Own Hands, and Broken Wings are the standouts, but the whole album is worthy of praise."
3,This one is ok but don't miss the other ones Go on and Pull!,"I'm glad the Misters finally hit the big success with this record, credit where it is due. Though it's not their best (except of course for the hits Broken Wings & Kyrie). The next one ""Go on"" is a leap forward, and together with the unreleased final album Pull it shows the mastery again of the ""Pages"" recordings from the period before Mr. Mister (see also the other reviews)!"
1,christmas will never be the same,my mom bought me this album for christmas and i killed her what more can isay
5,makes you want to have satan over for dinner,"the electric hellfire's ""Burn baby Burn"" has a great 60's ""flowerpower"" feel combined with Industrial/Techno-style beats. The music is powerful, satanic and sometimes funny. It's like Satanic disco with a little dose of acid just for effect. If Satan and Charles Manson ever Started a band together, this would be it. I love this!"
2,"Pretty, but only last a couple of months!","It's not like I'm out there exposing the panties to the elements and dragging it behind my car. But they only lasted a couple of months and that's with gentle handling (using the delicate setting on a front-load washer, a lingerie bag and hanging them to dry). They're pretty and silky, but don't bother."
4,"Nice collection, but . ..","This is a really nice collection of great bluegrass, but what happened to the Doc Watson cuts that were on the 1963 Newport album? He was incredible even back then, and their exclusion here is noticeable."
2,no need for this,"There are two Blitz greatest hits releases , and they're both pointless. The reason being Blitz's ""Voice Of A Generation"" has every Blitz track necessary. However this greatest hit comp features 4 extra tracks which are fantastic ""Razors In The Night"" , ""New Age"" , ""Fatigue"" ,and ""Youth""..and ""Overddrive"" from Killing Dream is included..but it's not that great of a song. What they need to do is release those 4 songs as bonus tracks on Voice..but I guess they feel need to shelve out as many packageings as they can to make a buck or two"
5,do you feel alright?oi! oi! oi! the boys are out tonight,"blitz is one of the greatest oi! bands of all time(the business is the best in my opinion)with songs like razors in the night,voice of a generation,warriors,and the oi!anthem someone's gonna die make them the best.-jason harshman"
4,An excellent trip down Memory Lane...,"When I was ten years old, this was one of my very favorite cassette tapes. Imagine my surprise when I found a copy of it at a second-hand record store on CD! I bought it, gave it another listen, and was surprised at how well I remembered the songs on it. The songs on this recording, as recorded by the stars of the fairly popular early-90s sitcom revolving around a Flintstones/Simpsons/Land of the Lost type of family of Dinosaurs, are somewhat cheesy and schmaltzy, but tuneful, memorable, wholesome, and at times, pretty darn funny!If you find a copy of it, grab it for your kids, unless you listened to it when you were one, and then get it for yourself. The reminiscent quality of it was definitely worth the price."
2,It was great until I used it!,"I've really enjoyed the case until the strap broke. It tore at the padded shoulder part. Luckily someone pointed it out to me before it tore all the way through. Apparently it isn't meant for every day use. I've tried to locate ""Motion Systems"" or ""Icon"" to complain but they don't seem to exist."

2,Grand Tunes Sad Recording,"A tawdry effort, this is live (I hope) and sadly the mix is way off or badly muffled and worse, the usual ICU humour is sadly missing.In all, save your cash for something more promising."
2,Grand Tunes Sad Recording,"This is live (I hope) and sadly the mix is way off or badly muffled and worse, the usual ICU humour is sadly missing.In all, rather a poor effort."
3,Great shoes,"This shoes is very comfortable and you can running around 7 miles without any problem, in my case the sole falls off in 8 months, and the shoes look like new, the mix of color is cool"
5,"ASICS Men's GEL-Nimbus VIII ( sz. 12.0, White/Lightning/Midnight )","Love these shoes, not too heavy but real comfortable and great support. I have bought quite a few pairs of Asics as they fit my foot well. Also like the 2120's but I got a great deal on these"
4,Great product,"Bought two pairs of Gel Nimbus VIII from Eastbay through Amazon.They were shipped almost immediately, but used 2 or 3 weeks to get to me in Norway.I think international shipping ought to be either cheaper and/or faster."
5,The best clock radio ever !!!,"I lost track on how many times I forgot to set my alarm clock Sunday night to wake me up Monday morning. But not with this alarm clock, this is the only alarm clock radio/ipod system that I program once and never touch it again.it's the year 2006 and there is no other real alarm programmable alarm clock on the market. I love it. Sounds great, good sturdy remote. the only draw back is that it is a bit bright."
1,Buyer beware: no quality control?,"I purchased 3 of these units and had to return each as they emitted a loud 60-cycle hum when turned on, with or without an iPod connected. Evidently Emerson doesn't check these things before they leave the factory. So: buyer beware!Without the hum, this might have been an OK unit, except for the excessively bright digital display, with no way to turn it down."
1,Automatic snooze: do not buy this,"There is an Automatic Snooze sensor in the front of this clock radio which automatically turns off the alarm and puts it in snooze mode if it senses ANY motion within 2 feet of the front of it, which is totally ridiculous. Just the motion of my body moving on the bed to the response of the alarm immediately turned off the alarm within seconds and put it in snooze mode. I exchanged the first one, thinking it was defective when this happened the first night I used it, then it immediately happened again on the second one, so I contacted Emerson customer service who confirmed that this a flaw in the design and is a known issue. I returned it, waste of money - I need the alarm to stay on for more than 5 SECONDS! I suggest you stay away from it, or be prepared to return it."
4,Screams for an external antenna,"Device is chock-full of neat features, like the built in back up battery, the self-setting clock, the preset radio stations and digital tuner, and the heat-sensitive snooze button that lets you just wave your hand in front of the display rather than whacking random buttons until silence is restored.The sound quality is respectable.The greatest trouble I have is with getting a clear radio signal, AM or FM. You can the alarm at night and have excellent clarity while your hand is on the device, but when it goes off in the morning and you are two feet away, prepare for an earful of static. I should add that I live in a one-story single-family home - so I'm not in a huge metal building - other radios I own with external antennae have excellent reception."
1,Great display - unusable due to hum,"I had been looking for an iPod based alarm clock with lit digits against a black background for a while before finding the iTone. (I have vision problems and black digits against a lit background is very difficult for me to read.) Unfortunatly, I have had to return both of the units I bought because of the awful hum that is heard whenever the playing music from any source (iPod/AM/FM all have it.)"
4,"V Good, esp for the price","I love everything about it, but the sound quality could be clipped up a bit. BUT, considering the price, I think it's great. Bought another version (not the same maker) from CostCo & wasn't as pleased. If I had to do over again, I'd buy this item again!"
4,this is nice for the price,"The display for the clock is a little bright, but not bad, and the sound quality is very nice for the price. It's not a BOSE, but it's not supposed to be. I'm very pleased with the product."
5,for me,i personaly dont think it is worth sending over $100 for a brand new one. but if u have the money go for it. for me it has all the feature's that i feel any clock radio and ipod/mp3 player should.
2,Not even close to advertisment,"Amazon states, this item will play any Ipod, not trueStates, this item will re-charge any ipod, not trueWill not recharge my 4th gen. nor does it come with a insert for 4th to fit the unit.Total false advertisment as to uses it is now in my garage as a radio!"
1,Loses correct time,"I bought this item and was pleased with it the first two weeks. Then I noticed the time was wrong one day. I thought maybe the power went out, but hey!! isn't this supposed to reset time itself? I ignored, changed it to correct time and about a week and a half later it did the same thing. It was about 45 minutes off. Changed the time back again, then a couple of weeks later, same thing, it was an hour behind. I am exchanging it today for an iHome which is what I wanted in the first place. If it can not keep time and wake me up at the right time for school, what good is it?"
5,Fantasic!,"What a great book! The CD was extremely helpful in aiding me towards exam preparation. The book was well-written, well-organized and spared me a lot of the technobabble so common in these types of books. I know I am going to use it again and again, even after the exam is over."
5,Love them!!,These are hours of fun! They are a challenge for all ages. They are particularly designed for 2nd through about 9th grade but we adults in the household find some of them challenging. Great for geometry preparation! --A good trick is to start with the largest pieces.
2,MAZZ FUERTE QUE NUNCA,"After waiting for Joe to come out with a new CD after breaking up with Jimmy, I was very disappointed. I think that Joe's voice is weak to say the least. He seems to be unsure and there's not much feeling to his voice. The band is very weak on the majority of the tracks and lacks excitement. Hopefully this isn't the end for Joe but he's following in the footsteps of other older artists that abused their voices with drugs or alcohol and lost their touch."
3,Discontinued watch,"Normally I can get my watches through another source at much better prices than Amazon offers, but we checked and Bulova doesn't make this watch anymore. I dislike ""leftovers"". I liked the look of this watch but not enough to buy it at that price when it's discontinued. I did wind up getting a beautiful, current, Bulova from their diamond collection."
5,The Trail to Hope Rose,I love movies that touch my heart. And this one did. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
4,hard life,It's an old story about miners being used so harshly. This movie captures it well.I like good endings and this one has it. LDP is as good as ever.
3,A clean western,"I love LDP and Ernest and the story line was a good one, but you could tell it was low buget. One think I liked about it was it was a good film that I could share with my younger visitors since some of my husbands high action movies are also high blood and guts or rated above PG13."
1,Trail no hope,"Brought this DVD and was unable to watch it due to it being in a different area code, this was not highlighted when purchasing the item, so have been lumbered with a DVD that I am unable to watch. I have tried watching it on the comuputer, playstation 3, and other DVD players but to no avail, if anyone has any suggestions would be much appreciated."
4,A great western,This is one of the best westerns I've seen. It has excitement with a good story and a wonderful ending. Lou Diamond Phillips and the supporting cast work well together.
5,Amazing!,"---Easy to read. Hard to forget. The author touched a nerve with his characters. I loved them all.--- A. Goss. AtlantaA stunning example of the old time stories with no obscenities. A rare sight these days.--- John Adams, TeacherStories that will touch your heart. He did it eloquently. You'll never forget them.---A. Morrison, EditorOne of those wonderful books to read in front of a fire on a cold winter evening. It will bring back great memories to the elderly and entertain the young.

3,Belkin USB Switch,"This switch works, but ... the user must press one key multiple times to switch to the desired device, and ... the switch has a nasty habit of skipping over one or more ports while pushing the button (thus missing the one you want), and ... since you may have to pass through 3 USB ports to get to the one you want - it can confuse PC's or ancillary devices.I think this would have been a better switch if it allowed to just press 1 of 4 buttons, thus selecting the USB port you want, rather than sequentially stepping through all ports to get to the one you want.But, as I said, it works."
5,this is a pretty amazing book,Even after 20 years have passed. What stands out most in reading it again is how so many of the changes we are going through were foretold and yet human beings seem to have no will to prepare for the future. Better leaders might have made the changes more tolerable but people would probably rejected leadership that did the hard things to make the transitions easier.There is hope in this book in spite of it all and it remains very important reading.
5,Packed with Knowledge!,"Perhaps the reason that Alvin Toffler's classic book feels so relevant some 25 years after its initial publication is the fact that he wrote it in a time which, in retrospect, was not so different from our own: The world was trembling before the threat of terrorism embodied, in Toffler's age, by Iranian terrorists, and radical new technologies, in the form of powerful and increasingly affordable computers, were drastically altering business and society. But probably, the book resonates simply because he was right about almost everything. For that reason, we from getAbstract recommend this book as a basic requirement for any professional."
5,Stew elevated to an art form,"This well presented and beautifully-written book presents stew recipes from around the world in a simple yet elegant and well-organised format.The book allows you (and shows you how) to build an entire menu around the stew of your choice. The choice is vast, and the results (so far) are delicious."
4,Not as good as the first novel,"While this novel was entertaining, it lacked the suspense of Sansom's first novel, Dissolution. The author builds an interesting story that seems to fall apart at the end. The conclusion is implausible and leaves the reader dissapointed."
5,A wonderful literary trap,I had recently read Dissolution on a long car trip and couldn't wait to get home to get and start Dark Fire. C.J. Sansom is a wonderful writer with fascinating plots and colorful interesting characters. His books are easily read to the point of you can not put them down. He is now one of my favorite writers and I can't wait for number three which I read is called Sovereign.
5,Addictive reading,"Please refer to my review of 'Dissolution', as my comments apply to the whole series. His writing will enthrall you completely."
4,Fun read,I bought this after reading another Shardlake book. Instant gratification is a big plus for this Kindle reader. I still prefer paper books tho.
5,entertaining & instructive,I highly recommend this for a fun historical mystery read. It really keeps you guessing and we have grown to love the Matthew Shardlake mysteries. You learn much about church and political history in England during the reign of Henry VIII and have fun. Can't beat it!
3,C.J. Sansom's sixteenth century thriller Dark Fire,"As a first time reviewer, I have to admit that I have not yet finished reading Dark Fire.Following along the lines of his previous books, Heartstone and Dissolution, ex-monk Matthew Shardlake continues in a mystery, thriller, historical novel that combines creativity and research in the Tudor world.Will finish reading Dark Fire when time permits.Virginia (Ginger) Szenas"
1,Anne,The contention that Anne was noble and gave her life for her country is utterly absurd. She was firstly a political pawn moved by her famliy and secondly desperately ambitious. Admiring Anne for her skillful manipulation of court politics is one thing but romanticising her as some kind of heroine misses the point entirely.
3,i need help,there is a track or song that doesnt exist in this soundtrack but it's found in the movie when paul walker helps vin diesel and get away from cops and then paul is invited at vin's house..so the music starts the moment they enter the house and walk the stairs and when vin's sister notice paul walker and started to change her clothes.. and the best part of this music is when the ex bf of mia is playing with the guitar and paul walker drinks beer and stares at mia's ex.. so pls ladies and gentlemen what's the name of this song (name and artist) coz it turns me onn.
1,stuff missing,"Does anyone know the name of the song, and who sings it, when the swat team busts into Johnny's house and while Vin Diesel and that other chick are making out? If you do know it, daf@webone.com.au"
3,"Disappointing, half of the soundtrack isn't in the movie!","A couple of the songs on this soundtrack are in the movie, but the rest aren't. I think this is just an overpriced Murder Inc./Def Jam music sampler! If you're looking for the rock and techno stuff then I recommend getting the ""More Fast and Furious: Music From and Inspired by (Inspired by is right, a couple of the songs weren't even around when FandTheF came outin theaters) soundtrack. There are 14 songs (2 from Saliva) and a couple other songs. That CD was one of the first Copy Protected CDs. Don't read the reviews to that one because most of them are rating it 1 star for the Copy Protection. But if you don't like rock, then just pick up this soundtrack, its okay."
4,this is good!,okay for all the peeps who like the ja rule scene this is for you. it is rocking the house with great lyrics and not only does it have some hard core stuff it also has a little romancing for the ladies. it is as good as the movie. go see the movie and go out to get this great soundtrack. as soon as i find a store selling it....it's mine.
1,This CD ...,When I saw the movie the songs were awesome but the soundtrack sounds like it is from another movie. I dont recognize almost any of the songs. The best song in the movie is on there. Where did this slow paced songs come from??
1,What happened to the good movie music?,"Just got back from the theater...the first thing I said when I walked out the door is ""I've got to get that soundtrack!"". After coming home and listening to the samples and seeing the artists on the CD, it's obvious that Def Jam is more interested in promoting their own artists than with providing me with a accurate movie soundtrack. Someone please let me know if they ever decide to release the real soundtrack, and who do I contact to complain about the current one. It's pure deception!"
1,NEED HELP!,does anyone know the song thats played when Brian is chasing the guys on the dirtbikes near the end of the film? i would really apresiate it. =]
1,Song not on soundtrack,the song they play when johhny trans house is invaded is a song called Debonaire by a band named Dope
2,The movie was great; The soundtrack is a joke!,"Argh! What is this??!! This can't be the actual soundtrack to the Fast & The Furious.Where'e all the industrial techno rock in the movie?! The music on here is mostly just plain rap. In fact this poor soundtrack sounds more like something I would play at a slumber party!The only reason I give this a two instead of a one is because that I personally thought the F&TF was great. Other than that, this soundtrack does not do the movie any justice! End Of Story!"
3,Hey!,"The is to Arcenite from Sicklerville, NJ. The band that plays on the SWAT part is Dope and the song is Debonaire. It can be found on their album Felons and Revolutionaires."
3,Not really what I was expecting,"I was hoping to hear some of the good techno tracks I heard from the movie. However, all I got were rap songs. Some a pretty good. Most of these songs are mediocore at best."
1,Rap music for an action flick?,"It's understandable why Ja Rule would have a song (or three..) on this soundtrack, obviously being his small co-role as one of the street racers. However, the action sequences that are spread out evenly through the film doesn't match a 99% rap/r&b genere of the album. I would have guessed 'Fast and the Furious' to be more rock driven than any other genre, Limp Bizkit was featured on both trailers for this picture with 'My Way' and '9 Teen 90 Nine' yet only one song is heard here and it's the [Rap Version] of 'Rollin' (how ironic). Poor soundtrack for a very good movie...think harder on the next one"
1,Extremely disappointing,"This was total ...! I bought this expecting to get the movie music, and instead got the ... hip-hop punk ... that was also unfortunately part of the movie. If you, too, wanted the GOOD music from this flick, then look elsewhere, because this is NOT it."
1,complete garbage. you should be ashamed,"Sadly, like everyone else knows, the actual soundtrack just wasn't released for this movie.. who knows what this stuff is.... looks like someone didn't have much time, through a bunch of random songs on the cd that just didn't have anything to do with the movie and called it a soundtrack.. well minus ja rule's furious...."
1,Missing Music,"Durring the movie I heard a few good hard rock songs and some techno and then when I looked at the song list, they were all missing. The R&B music does not fit the movie at all."
1,Total Dissapointment,"The movie is amazing ... but the soundtrack is horrible. In the movie, there are 2 songs by Saliva, and 1 song by Dope, neither of which are on the soundtrack. The mix of rock and rap in the movie is great. However there is no actual rock on the CD. If you were going out to race, you want something with high adrenaline fast tempo, not R&B. See the movie, but pass on the soundtrack ..."
2,at least listen to the samples before you buy!,"i'm not panning the movie or even the cd, but did you notice the music used in the ads/trailers? well, that kind of high octane is all but absent in the soundtrack -- in other words even the movie's own promoters recognized that the soundtrack does little to evoke the sheer urge to drive fast and furious."
3,The Actual Score List,"""Deep Enough"" - Live (When Brian pulls up to Toretto's Diner) although it's some rap version. ""Lock It Down"" - Digital Assassins (What Dom plays before the night race). ""Nurega"" - Organic Audio (When Dom & Brian arrive at the party). ""Polka Palabras"" - Molotov (One of the spanish rap). ""Superstar"" - Saliva. ""Debonaire"" - Dope. ""Nocturnal Transmission"" - BT. ""Godspeed"" - BT. There's a few more, but I can't remember, try going to BTmusic.com and hit the message boards to find the others."
1,wtf???,None of this music was in the movie with the exception of one or two songs....i wanted the hardcore techno beats that were all through the movie...and all i got was R&B and Rap. Very very disappointed.
2,ANSWERS FOR SONGS,"Ok, so the song playing when Brian goes and we see mia for the first time is a song called ""Deep Enough (Urban remix)"" by Live. I have the other songs written down, including the one played between the two buildings, so I will find them and tell you. If you all want only the songs that were actually in the movie, rent the dvd, and take about ten minutes to watch the credits and write down the song names and artists. That's how I have only the songs that are in the movie."
2,Not what I expected,"I was very disapoined to find that practically none of the songs I enjoyed from the actual movie were on the Soundtrack. I mean, isn't that the meaning of a soundtrack, to let people listen to the songs they liked in the movie. I have nothing against rap, but I enjoyed the heavier songs during the movie, and thinking that there was at least one on the CD, I bought, only to find out later that it was all rap and R&B. Next time a movie comes out with songs in it that they won't put on the soundtrack I suggest they put a disclaimer after the movie telling potential customers not to buy their product because it will not be what they want."
2,neither fast nor furious,R&B that doesn't make my adrenaline rush or make me want to drive fast. I was hoping for a CD of the pumping electronica that was blasting during the establishing shots of the racing scenes (especially the nighttime streetrace sequence).
2,Not too bad.... but they left out the GOOD stuff,The soundtrack is overall not too bad. But i would have really liked it if they had added all the techno music onto the soundtrack which would have made it a lot better that what it is right now.... that music really gets you in the mood for speed. I hope they release another CD with more songs from the actual movie....
1,What happened here??,"Well, if you saw the movie, you know that most of the music in it is good Rock/alternative/dance...but then when you listen to this soundtrack it's very dissapointing. In the movie alot of the music was ""pump-me-up"" music that really did want to make you drive fast and kick a**. Plus, Ja-Rule must really have some stake in this soundtrack...3 songs??? I'm sorry but this soundtrack just doesn't fit with the movie at all with the exception of the Limp Bizkit. Maybe for those of you who like rap and R&B, this is the perfect cd...but for those of us who don't really care for that, this just didn't hit the spot. I do hope however, that there will be a release of the actual music used in the movie, because if that were the case I would be the first at the store to buy it!! Oh, and by the way...if you haven't seen the movie, go ahead and see it. The acting isn't great, but there are some great car scenes!! CYA"
2,HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When brian goes to his first race in the eclipse there is a song that starts ""tell me whats the secret im missing and im...."" i would really appreciate it if someone could tell me the name of the song and the artist.Thanks."
2,Not worth my time.....or money,"I recently saw ""The Fast and The Furious"" and loved it, so later on, I went on to purchase the soundtrack to it...After listening to it, I was very disappointed in it. The songs that were on the CD were not on the movie....and songs that I heard on the movie were not on the CD(ex: ""Watch your back"" by Benny Cassette) So unless they decide to come out with a second soundtrack for all of the other songs they left out, the first one isn't worth my time....or money"
1,not the right kind of music,"Like many others here I noticed that this just isn't the right type of music for this movie. I came out of the movie wanting to get the soundtrack because of all the fast paced techno and rock that just makes you want to peel out doping 190 on the highway. If you like hip hop than go for it, but if you really wanted to hear the music from the movie, you won't find it here."
1,Wrong soundtrack for the type of movie,The soundtrack should be compose with rock and dance music 'cause is the kind of music that you hear whe you are drivin and driving fast. With this R&B songs you might get sleep in the steering wheel. This soundtrack don't fit with the movie.
1,Pure garbage,This soundtrack is a total waste of money and time. Why the heck is there so much Ja Mooo in the CD and the songs in the soundtrack are something banged up by musicians with 3r-grade talents or no talents. It's a COMPLETE disgrace to the movie; oh the shame. ...
2,"Not Much ""Driving"" Music","I don't know, call me a purist -- but racing movies generally have songs that make you want to well, race. This is all R&B and rap, none of which really had the tempo to make me want to floor it. Rollin is the notable exception."
4,which song?,"can sumone temme the name of the song that plays when brian comes to doms house for the first time, when the party's on... which has vince playin a add-on tune in the middle with an electric... its a very catchy tune but i cant find its name..."
2,This is the soundtrack to the movie???,"Like many other people mentioned, the songs from the movie are not on this soundtrack, which makes me wonder why it's even called a movie soundtrack. I watched the movie and thought that the music in it was great. It was very techno and upbeat, then I bought the CD only to find out that almost the entire CD is rap. I will admit that the CD is good, but it's not what I expected. I was very disappointed when I first listened to the CD, but I gave it a chance and thought that it was alright."
1,the house music is where?,"i almost bought this cd but then after looking at the titles realised that the cd probably didn't contain the one song i was looking for. the reviews posted here on amazon confirm my suspicion.in the first party scene (at which dom and brian arrive via cab), there is a terrific post-disco house music track playing in the background. if anyone knows who did this song, please post here so i can go buy whatever cd it is on, because it obviously isn't on the movie soundtrack...and, in case anyone cares, the house track being played during the first race wars scene is by BT and is available on his album ""Ima"" which is a few years old but is still in print."
3,That one song,"When he's racing the Ferrari there is a song that comes on. ""Make me your superstar, it don't matter who you are"" Does anyone know what this song is?"
1,Whats this song called,"Whats the song called and who is it sung by when Brian pulls up to the cafe where mia works, its like a little italian/ spanish love song, plz plz tell me i love it an cant find it!"
3,"The Song is called ""Deep Enough"" by Live",@ sunspearHelloWhen Brian comes to the Toretto's bar. He's driving his pickup. And this song is called Deep Ennough by Live!Enjoy the song :)
1,Why isn't Quarashi on this soundtrack,You ask who is Quarashi well they are a great icelandic punk band and when I see the preveiw for this movie I here one of the great songs stick em' up so why are they in the preveiws but not the sound track give the some recognition
1,avoid at all cost,This disc will not play on many cd/dvd players and many computers. Sadly the music here simply doesn't make this disc worth the hassle and it should be about the music.
3,name of missing song,the name of the song when the racers meet between the buildings before the first race is Say Aah by Shawna...
1,HELP,"hey guys, i need to know where to get the song ""Say Aah"" by Shawna..i can't find it anywhere. can someone please helpthanks"
4,where can i find,Does anyone know where i can find the first song played in the movie the one i think is called bt- ovie remix theme.
5,help?!?!?,"ok u know the part where the first race....they show the 2 buildings and then the song rite there it goes somethin like ""tell me what the secret of missin and im gonna come and get it"" any one know what the song is called"
2,OUCH,Well when i saw the advertisement for this soundtrack...i thought there would be rock music that that would go with driving fast. and i coulnd't have been more wrong....not a single rock song on there....now i like rap but there is a total of 3 songs on this cd that i like. be sure to listen to what u can before u buy this cd....u'll be glad u did.
4,"Good beats, but not the actual music from the movie.","I bought this CD the night after I saw the movie, hoping to get the great techno beats heard through most of the movie. But, I was very disappointed. People say, ""Your fault, should have read the back of the CD!"" but that is a foolish statement. A lot of people (including me) didn't know who people like Ja Rule and Caddillac Tah were until I heard the soundtrack. For all I knew at the time, they could have been Techno/Electronic artists. (...)"
3,Dissappointed,"Ok I was dissappointed to. I mean where was Limp Bizkit's ""My Way"" that was played in all the movie previews? I really miss the techno tracks but this is a good collection of the R&B tracks that were in the movie."
2,Not from bt,"I just saw the movie and went out to pick up the soundtrack, I was dissapointed. The problem is that bt did the score but isn't involved here in the soundtrack. I would love to see a cd with the music from the movie. If anyone else feels the same they should check out some of bt's earlier stuff (Ima, ESCM) as it was used in the score."
1,Fast and furiously running to return the soundtrack!,"So, I saw the movie and loved the techno in it. I got suspicious when the credits rolled and said that the music was done by BT, but there was no mention of the soundtrack with that particular music on it. So, after the movie I ran to a nearby music store and bought the soundtrack without checking the track list first, the store was about to close, and I was trusting that if the producers wanted to make money off the soundtrack they would put the songs from the movie on it, boy was I wrong! I was more than disappointed when I heard the songs on my way home, actually I was really mad about this. The movie is about drag racing and the soundtrack should mirror that. I am waiting for the REAL soundtrack to come out, the one with all that great techno on it!"
1,???????????,"I Think One of these songs was in the movie, i didn't recognize any others, I was lookin for the song from the rave at race wars and it wasn't there, its all rap and r&b. I know slow r&b doesn't get me feeling like i want to go fast. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!"
3,Actual Music In The Movie,"Here's a list of the actual songs used in the movie. ""Deep Enough"" - Live (When Brian pulls up to Toretto's Diner) although it's some rap version. ""Lock It Down"" - Digital Assassins (What Dom plays they race on the street). ""Nurega"" - Organic Audio (When Dom & Brian arrive at the party). ""Polka Palabras"" - Molotov (One of the spanish rap). ""Superstar"" - Saliva (Not sure). ""Debonaire"" - Dope (When the SWAT bust Johnny Tran). ""Watch Your Back"" - Benny Cassette (When Brian and Vince fight). ""Nocturnal Transmission"" - BT. ""Godspeed"" - BT. There's a few more, but I can't remember, hope this helps. (...)"
2,"Good, but not what I was looking for from this movie!","This is an okay mix of songs, but it's nothing like the music played in the movie. I was really disappointed listening to the samples, because NONE of the songs I loved from the movie are here. And I can't place most of these songs as even being in the movie. I'm glad I listened to the samples before going out and buying this CD!"
1,"hmmm ""MOVIE"" soundtrack?","I adore this movie, been to see it three times ^_~... I loved the music in the movie so I thought to myself ""I want this soundtrack""...I bought the CD and to my surprise only a few songs are actually from the movie I was so dissapointed. Sure, I know, a few of the songs in the movie were rap or whatever, I was fine with that I just didn't expect the whole soundtrack to be filled with it. I feel as if I really wasted money on this cd the songs I bought it for aren't even on it. Last time I saw the movie I counted at least ten songs missing from Soundtrack...I mean if its a ""MOVIE SOUNDTRACK"" why are there songs on there I didn't hear during the movie? I also heard, not sure if its true though, that since so many people were complaining about the soundtrack that they will be releasing a second soundtrack, containing actual MOVIE MUSIC, sometime this fall...hopefully it will be an accurate ""MOVIE SOUNDTRACK""..."
1,My money went fast and the soundtrack left me furious.,"I saw the movie and loved it, bought the sound track and hated it. This soundtrack does not contain any of the music that was in the film. I seems to be more of a collection of songs inspired by the movie. I gave it one star only because I had to. Don't get me wrong now there are a lot of hard hitting tracks on it but not my style and not what I was looking for."
3,"Good, but not what I expected.","Ok, I love rap. I listen to Ja Rule fairly often, but it was just disappointing that they copied [a song] from Ja Rule's year 2000 album Rule 3:36 under a different title (entitled Furious on the soundtrack). That track was popular then, but a fast-paced track would have been better off in its place now. Alot of the faster tracks that I heard on the movie, which were why I bought the soundtrack almost as soon as it came out, were not on the soundtrack, and although I do listen to Ja Rule, this whole soundtrack was basically just him. If you are, like I was, looking for a fast-paced soundtrack with plenty of heart thumping, adrenalin pumping music, then I'm sorry, this is not it. You'll have to look else-where. If your looking for a movie soundtrack thats basically a collection of old and new songs, that are mostly from Ja Rule, then this is the album for you."
1,What is this ?,Where any of these songs in the movie? What happened to all the large techno beats that come from this movie? I definatly want to get fast and furious after listening to these songs ;-I~~~~
1,"a lot of slow paced rap, none of the movie's techno is here","Don't buy this cd if you're looking for techno or if you listen to your music off a portable mp3 player.Dude, this was way dissappointing. I don't hate rap but I was expecting to hear some of the fast paced techno from the movie. Wish I had read the reviews posted here before I bought the cd. Especially the one that says that the soundtrack cd has a software lock on it that prevents you from copying it or converting the tracks to mp3s. I mean, how am I supposed to listen to it on my portable mp3 player?"
1,Where are the good songs in the movie?,"I felt completely ripped off when I bought this soundtrack. All the songs that I heard in the movie that I wanted aren't on the soundtrack! And the remake of Madonna's ""Justify my Love"" is an insult to Madonna. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this CD."
1,songs,"I'm sure glad I sampled songs before I made the decision not to purchase this CD. I liked some of the techno songs which I found online to download after watching the movie. Everyone is right, many of the songs IN the movie are missing, such as, ""Watch your Back"" (I believe that is the title) That was an awesome song, yet it was not on the CD.As a street racer the good bass from rap songs are great and all..but Furious - by Ja Rule was the only one worth while playin' on the stereo.Therefore, one star for one decent song."
2,not pleased,"I loved the movie and songs that was played on the movie but when I bought the soundtrack, hardly any of the songs were on it. I was very disappointed."
3,"Fast & Furious, well not really","I actually own a high power turbo charged car like those in the film, so I thought great, I got the car, now all I need is the Music to cruise to, So I played the CD in the car and cruised for around an hour and I honestly thought that I had the wrong CD playing, this soundtrack surely cant be off the fast & furious its all slow & tender. I feel ripped off as I thought a soundtrack actually contained the music from the film, and as far as I can tell I dont hear anything I recognise from the movie.If you are a fan of R&B, Rap then buy it you may like it but if you expect the music from the movie then dont as it dosent contain any of it."
2,You get what you pay for,"First let me say that soap pumps in general are very economical - a great way to save money by using less soap or even shampoo. I like to use castile soap or Burt's Bees baby shampoo in a soap pump; however I don't recommend this one. I have a few of the Pampered Chef brand soap pumps, and since this item looks almost identical, I thought I would give it a try. Unfortunately, the very first time I used one of them, the top popped off and a tiny plastic piece ejected out. I have lost this tiny piece out of both pumps on several occasions, and when it is missing, the soap doesn't foam very well. Even more disconcerting, though, is the fact that I have two small kids in the house, and this little part is definitely small enough to be a choking hazard. I think I'm going to replace them. The hazard is not worth saving a few bucks on a cheaper brand."
4,Stylish Russian singer!,"Kristina Orbakaite, a daughter of the Russian megastar Alla Pugacheva, has always had a style of her own. It shows in this CD where some of her best songs are presented.Kristina has been performing solo on the Russian pop stage for more than 10 years now. She has received the World Music awards, the Bronze Microphone and the Gold Grammophone awards, and many others, along with the love of her fans."
3,I just don't know...,"I bought this by recommendation from a taty page, but she sounds more middle eastern than russian."
5,The Consummate Love Story,"Just like in ""Pegasus,"" the story of ""Cupid and Psyche"" retells the myth of the two lovers in a very accessible manner, which makes it ideal for young children and anyone else who is unfamiliar with Greek mythology. Cupid and Psyche are perfect for each other, but, as is often the case in love stories, they must overcome great trials before they can be together. In a sense, it's by going through the trials that realize just how much they love each other."
5,Beautiful book but not for age 4,"The School Library Journal says GRADES 5-8. The Amazon description says AGES 4-8. I would put this more in the former category. It's a beautiful story told in detail. There is really a lot of detail here. In addition, some of the story is rather heavy and serious, as when Psyche betrays Cupid and he warns her that ""Love cannot live without trust."" A bit heavy for a 4-year-old, I think. I would not recommend this for nursery, K or first grade. I agree with the other reviewers that it is a beautiful book but would save it for somewhat older kids."
1,Look elsewhere for magnifier.,"I would had given this lower than 1 full star but thats as low as you can go. I am making this review short and sweet as there is nothing to write home about on this one. When attached, the magnifier doesn't want to stay up too well. Once snapped onto my gameboy advance sp, it's almost imposible to get it off with out breaking it or using a tool that would scratch the paint on my GBA sp. It always has a glare. Constantly having to tilt it one way or another, depending on what section of the screen you want to see. It magnifies great. Bout all I can say good. Guess thats worth a star. One more thing, the GBA sp lid won't shut all the way with this thing attached. So to fold the GBA sp up, you have to remove it, again you will have problems. Stay far away from this and save your 10 bucks."
5,One of Heyer's funniest romps - read it!,"The Talisman Ring is one of Georgette Heyer's best novels - funny, fast paced, with wonderfully witty dialog and a few surprises.Most of the action takes place at a smuggler's inn, with characters like Eustacie (young French girl who escaped the Revolution), Sir Tristam Shield (is he a murderer or love interest?), Sarah Thane (spinster with nerves of steel) and her brother Sir Hugh Thane (justice of the piece or smuggler's friend?), Ludovick Lavenham (smuggler and cheat or wronged gentleman?) and more.A great introduction to her work for new readers, and a must-read for Regency fans. Three thumbs up!"
3,The Talisman Ring,Heyer does her usual magic with plot development and rich characterisations. I personnally would have enjoyed the novel more if I had had to hand a French to English dictionary.
4,What a great little mystery,"Georgette Heyer - what a great author. I don't think there was anything she couldn't write.This is fairly typical - a neat little regency romance with a dash of mystery thrown in. The characters include a young man, falsely accused of murder, his older cousins (one of whom just *might* be the villain of the piece), an intelligent and courageous young woman (isn't it nice how her female characters are *never* just 'window-dressing'?), who winds up with the hero - perfect reading for a lazy evening by your fireplace.The story's not 'deep', so if you're looking for a philosophical or moral treatise, look elsewhere, but damn it's a good read if you just want to kick back and immerse yourself in the Regency period."
5,THE TALISMAN RING,"Easily one of the best of Georgette Heyers books and one of the most humorous. Instead of a great manor house where her stories usually take place, the majority of this story takes place in an ""inn"". I would have a hard time selecting my favorite character in this book, Tristan,Sara Thane,Ludovic, Eustacie and even Joseph Nye the innkeeper all contribute mightily to this story and move it along with humor and romance. I almost forgot! I think my favorite character would be ""the old Lord Sylvester"", who promptly dies at the beginning of this tale but as the protagonist, if it was not for him along with his disagreeable personality and his disquieting ability to ""hit the nail square on the head"" when opining on the character traits of his relatives and heirs is priceless. Enjoy this!"
1,Poor version of a good book.,"While this has always been my favorite Heyer, this particular version is awful: misspellings, incorrect words, large tracts of dialogue left out - and believe me, I checked it against my falling-apart hard copy. The result is I shall be sticking to my falling-apart hard copy in the future."
2,not one of her better stories,"Mostly wanted to just leave a rating rather than a review.Looks like I am going to be the odd man out here. I have read many GH books and, for me, this one was just not one of her better stories."
4,An early Georgette Heyer,"At last, publishers are starting to print the novels of this author, the best of Regency novel writers. Her novels are admittedly the inspiration for modern day romance authors.Talisman Ring has much to recommend it: sprightly characters, a mystery to be solved, and two love stories. Ludovic and Eustacie are young and feckless, while Sir Tristram and his love are more sedate, but still entrancing.Those who read this novel for the first time are lucky to have found one of the great writers of the genre."
5,The Talisman Ring,"Those new to Georgette Heyer, as well as her devoted fans, will be riveted to this, one of her best novels. As always, the characters are well drawn, and the element of mystery will keep readers turning the pages long after their bedmates have gone groaning to sleep, covering their heads with their pillows. As a life-long Georgette Heyer fan, I thank my lucky stars this novel has been reissued so that her work can begin to find the audience it has always deserved."
5,Oh so funny,"The wit, humour and plot are delightful. Once again Georgette Heyer rocks! The journey back to Regency England is always a pleasure."
4,The Tailsman Ring,"This book is set in the 1790's. Eustacie de Vauban, 18, has escaped France and is now living with her grandfather Baron Lavenham. On his deathbed he summons his great-nephew, Sir Tristram Shield, 31, to his side and arranges for him to marry his granddaughter Eustacie. Since she has fanciful romantic notions she decides to runaway from the serious Sir Tristram and meets with smugglers.After one of the smugglers is shot she heads to an inn to assist the wounded man. There Eustacie befriends Miss Sarah Thane, 28. They learn about the tailsman ring and figure it would be a great adventure to try to steal back the ring in order to prove the fugituve nobleman's innocence.Once again, Heyer creates a great cast with entertaining dialogue and plot. Clean romance."
5,Fast-paced Inocent Fun!,"Smugglers, an emigree from the Terror of France in 1790 and an unsolved murder preventing the rightful heir from claiming his inheritance! All exciting, fast-paced ingredients you expect from a Georgette Heyer novel. One of her best adventure stories with well-rounded characters that you can easily identify with, plenty of twists and turns in the plot, witty and, of course, a smattering of romance. Very well written and highly plausible, one that I always come back to when I want a satisfactory read. My daughter read this at 14 years old, but I would not recommend all of Heyers novels as suitable for this age-group."
4,The Talisman Ring,This is a really funny book! Romance seems to be the genre but it also includes mystery and humor. Don't miss it!
4,job-site radio or radio for the job-site,"The Milwaukee Job-site radio looks durable and tough like their power tools. It has an aggressive tool-style and produces great sound quality versus Bosch/Dewalt. It looks impressive in my workshop and the finish matches my Milwaukee tools. The only negatives are 1) large and heavy for what it offers (digital AM/FM tuner, 20 pre-sets, RockfordFosgate 3-level Punch EQ bass boost, 2 speaker system, auxilliary stereo jack & 12V output) and 2) does not achieve maximum total system power with 120V AC. It may not be too exciting for some owners as a non-job-site radio unless they are Milwaukee tool fans. The Makita job-site radio is more compact and not quite as durable-looking and lacks any extra ""punch"" options; however its compact size means I would probably bring the Makita to THE JOB-SITE."
4,Great Job Radio,"The radio is great, looks good, sounds good, the only thing I dont like is that you can only use tool type batteries & it don't charge them when pluged into house current"
5,"Cool, Tough, Affordable","I've wanted one of these for a long time and I finally bought one and needless to say it has all the Milwaukee quality you would expect.Sounds great, looks great and just feels like it will last a lifetime. As for charging batteries,that's not why I bought it, I wanted a tough, versatile, good looking radio to go from the shop to the beach and I got it!Want a charger?, I hear tell Milwaukee makes a pretty cool three bay charger, right tool for the job eh!"
5,The Crown,"Three months ago I aquired a beautiful 600lb Stanley workbench and went about looking for a little ""crowning"" item to finish the presentation. The Milwaukee Job Site Radio is just the ticket! Not only impressive looking but great sound and built to last. I can take it with me and power it for four or five hours on my two Milwaukee drill batteries although it will not charge them when a/c is available. I have never been disappointed with anything from Milwaukee.KDM"
3,Batterys are CRAZY HIGH,I just wanted to say this is a great radio ... I only returned it cause the batterys are way too expensive... If you own Milwaukee tools this is a have to have ...if you dont and want the full 44 watts you have to buy a 150 + dollar battery and a charger (cause this will not charge them) .. I also dont understand why you get less watts when you plug it in... You should get 44 watts when you plug it in ...not less than half .. just my 2 cents still worth the 3 stars ... If they would make it a full 44 watts when you plug it in ...then I would buy it again
3,Antenna is not the best,I was very dissapointed with the reception of this radio. We took it to the lake and we can hardly get any stations at all. We even changed the small antenna to a larger one but no change.
3,Adequate but overpriced,"I did my homework prior to purchasing this radio and after looking at the other major brands I decided on the Milwaukee. It worked ok for about 35 days and then suddenly that was it; the only noise that it would make was a loud electrical buzz. After many emails and phone calls I was able to get it replaced with a new one. I have only had it for twenty days so I am not prepared to say that it is a durable product. It works ok but the reception is not as good as I would have hoped. All things considered, the radio is a little pricey relative to the quality."
3,job site radio,It's a 40 watt Fosgate great sound it was billed out as a 28volt but the 28 volt battery won't fit it must be a 18 volt wrong labeling!!
3,The ad was misleading,"I bought this Milwaukee Jobsite radio back in October for my husband for Christmas thinking it was in stand alone condition and ready to use. I was thrilled that I could give him something useful and entertaining. There was nothing in the ad regarding the price not including the battery and battery charger. Today, I called Milwaukee customer service and spoke to a supervisor about this and pointed out that I felt the ad was misleading. The supervisor said Milwaukee will not pay return postage and that the battery and charger would cost $126 plus S/H. This is considerably more than the refurbished radio cost me to begin with and even more than a new radioMilwaukee 49-24-0280 V18/V28 Jobsite Radio Refurbished. Since the battery and charger are unaffordable for me to purchase and the unit is useless to my husband without the battery and charger, I will return it. It makes me sad to have purchased something as a gift that is not in stand-alone condition."
1,Milwaukee Job Site Radio,I found this for my sister to purchase for her boyfriend. It only lasted about 4 months and then it broke. The only repair shop was 50 miles away and she hasn't got it back yet. Big disappointment.
1,long time no see,"If you need a radio that will be heard in a production plant, this is not the one, everything everyone else says about the radio is true it would be great for the construction site. It took 3 weeks to get to me, I had to call to find out what was going on, and another one had to be shipped."
4,NOAA Weather radio reception is dicey....,"I live in the Dallas area and can not receive anything in the weather radio band, even though there is a transmitter in the Dallas area. I've had similer results with the display units I see at home centers, so I'm confident that I don't have a outright defective unit.Even though, I have no intention of returing it. It runs 8-10 hours on a 18 volt Milwaukee battery. AM and FM reception is fine. The punch EQ sounds good too.I wish they had included charging capability in the radio, even if it raised the price up to that of it's chief competetor DeWalt's version. But if you already have Milwaukee cordless tools, it's a moot point.I reserved one star for the hit-and-miss NOAA reception. If you can live with this fact, you'll be more than pleased with the radio."
4,Great heavy duty radio,"I bought this radio to use in a noisy industrial environment. I like the fact it had a Rockford Fosgate amp, and the Milwaukee name swayed me too. Using the FM tuner, the music is loud enough to hear, and other radios in the same environment have trouble with reception. The Milwaukee radio gets excellent reception always. The 12volt cigarette lighter style receptacle is really nice for charging a cell phone.My major disappointment is the optional line in. I really wanted to plug in my MP3 player and listen to my old albums I had ripped. Unfortunately the volume will not go up high enough to hear anything coming from my MP3 player. It could be set wrong, but I doubt it. Keep in mind this is in a very loud industrial area that requires me to wear hearing protection, so any radio that can be heard over all the other noises is doing well!All in all, I'm happy with this radio."
2,Textbook,The reading is a bit complex. A lot of information. Definitely a read that needs a constructive guidance from a professor.
1,RUBBISH!! CRAP!! THE WORST !!,"THIS IS A WASTE OF $$$all they did was get a girl who looks nothing like Amy , put makeup on her the way amy wore her makeup and she sits on a sofaand basically repeats every written article that Amy had been quoted from. Nothing new, terrible actors play flashback scenes( there are probaly just 3 in there) .. I wish i could get my money back..Anybody wants my copy before i throw it in the garbage?I could have wasted 20 bucks in a much better way.."
2,No very disapointed,"I think Amy is inteesting enough and th interview footage of her family / friends would be the best way to tell her story. I was unhappy of the lack of real video and that it was a ""made for TV movie""She was such a sensation she must have been the youngest to have a movie less than two years AD to have a film about her what a waste for everyone who was fooled by the look alike."
2,Ericsson T226 poor sound and reception,"I previously had a samsung, while living in the same location which had far better sound and reception than does the ericsson."
1,2nd worst phone I ever had,"Used with Cingular in Tennessee. I am supposedly in a mid to high level Cingular area, but my phone is almost unusable at home. I don't remember the phone being so bad when I first got it. Cingular doesn't seem to want to do anything for us on this phone, and we bought 2 of them. I paid for a Nokia 3595 replacement and it did super in the same location! I will probably be getting a second Nokia 3595 and then when my contract is up with Cingular I will probably switch to T-Mobile since they wouldn't help me with any costs of buying a new phone. Buyer beware of both the T226 and Cingular. In my opinion, the T226 is worse than Cingular, though. I was happy with Cingular until they wouldn't help me. They did offer to replace my T226 with another T226 but after having 2 that wouldn't work properly I didn't want to waste my time with another. They SHOULD understand that, but the losers don't care."
1,Awful phone,"I have another year and a half with this phone unless I break down and spend too much on another one... I've found the battery life to be pretty good, but that's about the only feature I like. The screen is hard to read (dark, even on the brightest setting), the sound quality is terrible--sounds like you're traveling through water and at a higher volumes, it's really harsh-sounding. The buttons are hard to use without looking at them and the voice activation feature only recognizes your numbers occasionally. It also doesn't repeat back your command, so you don't know without looking at the screen if it's connecting to the correct number--not too handy if you're driving. The car charger was $27 which I found ridiculously high... I HATE this phone. I wish there was an option for NO stars."
5,I actually love this phone!!!,"Unlike all the other reviewers - almost all of them, anyway - I really like my phone. I got it for Christmas 03 and it has always worked beautifully and never broken even when I dropped it in a parking lot. Doesn't scrach easily and the ONLY probs are that sometimes (once in a blue moon) it will black out. AND you have to attach the camera which irritates me. :(~Sock"
4,"good, compact phone","I've had my T226 phone for a couple weeks so far and I have had nothing to complain about. Reception in Fresno and LA has been very good. The phone is very light and compact, it easily fits in my pants pocket. Checking the weather forecast and sports scores is quite easy, an unexpected bonus. The only downside that I have observed is that in bright sunlight the color screen can be difficult to read.This phone is being used with Cingular Wireless."
4,its ok,"1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2. The screen color is not as great as what I was looking at online3. Its kind of smaller than I thought it was4. Nice ringtones5. I would perfer Verizon, but Cingular has rollover minutes, and if Verizon had rollover, I would definitly get Verizon over Cingular. But Cingular is still an okay, phone company."
2,Good phone bad service,"I've had this phone for a year and for the first few months it worked perfectly fine. Then in May my text messeges started delaying by a few hours. A friend would send one at 6:30 pm and I'd get it at 2:30 at the morning! I told cingular about the problem and they said it would be back to normal within a couple weeks. Five months went by and it just got worse. Soon I wasn't able to even send anything. But luckily it works now but I'm not sure how long it will. Overall its a good phone. Its small and easily fits in my pocket or backpack. Its simple to use too. I like the bright color screen, and the ringtones are okay but I wish there was a better selection. You can also record stuff to use as a ringtone or make a personal memo. Like I said: Good phone, bad service."
3,Not really a Yardbirds Reunion,"The surviving members of the Yardbirds recorded two CDs in the late 80's under the name ""Box of Frogs"" with their former bassist Paul Samwell Smith and several guest guitarists, including Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. ""Birdland"" has some decent new songs that are better than the new Rolling Stones songs on ""Forty Licks"". The remakes are okay for a listen or two, but speed guitarists Steve Vai, Joe Satriani and Steve Lukather don't understand what the Yardbirds were all about. They overplay and don't compliment the songs. Jeff Beck's solo demonstrates that taste is more important than speed."
5,A new cd from the YARDBIRDS???? You must be joking,"Those were my first thoughts. I am a child of the sixties and grew up with some awesome YARDBIRD hits, but not one decent ALBUM ( as they were known ). What a shock to finaly get the awesome album that they were unable to produce in their prime a mere 38 years later. This is like the quintessential british R&B cd from the 60's using 21st century technology, musos that have improved by about 35 years and a guest list that makes you drool with anticipation. This is irresistable and all the updated versions of their original songs improve 100 % from the new treatment. If you liked the original YARDBIRDS, you're bound to love this incarnation."
2,Where's the blues?,"Much of the charm of the vintage Yardbirds was the fact that the musicians were steeped in blues tradition. The problem with Birdland is that the blues sound is largely gone. Instead, a lot of it sounds like 80's heavy metal covers of Yardbird songs. I think the band missed the boat with this one."
2,Yardbirds - Birdland,"Not quite what I expected - I chose this album as it contained more of the songs I knew. However, this isn't the 'Yardirds' I remember back in the 60's, as these are re-recordings, and whilst some of the songs may be after Keith Relf had died, none are the original recordings nor featuring Keith Relf. Some songs do stick to the original, but the guitar solo on 'Shapes of Things' sounds nothing like the original. Still good to listen to, but with hindsight, would have chose a different album."
4,Great Color,I first noticed this monitor at one of those computer stores where they place all the monitors on the same shelf. This one really stood out for color and very sharp focus. I watch movies and play some games and I haven't noticed any ghosting. The only thing that I wish I could do is rotate the screen for word processing (kind of a minor complaint). Otherwise this is a very good monitor and the price is good for a 19 inch LCD.
1,"Poems,...","I suppose the reason I really didn't like this book was because I am not a fan of peotry. I prefer fiction novels, mysteries, adventures, etc. I did however appreciate the whole background of why the book was put together."
5,Why can't US pop be this good?,"Don't let the group's name fool you. This is breezy and beautiful pop music with intelligent lyrics and glorius melodies that you can truly sing along with. You'll have a hard time getting these songs out of your head. If you like this CD, you won't go wrong if you also buy any of their other CDs.There is a special edition of ""Sing Along with the Acid House Kings"" that comes as a 2 disc set; one disc is the regular CD and the second disc is a DVD with videos of all the songs in both the sung versions and karaoke versions. Lyrics are present on the videos to help you sing along but it won't be long until you'll know the lyrics by heart. In addition, there are 3 bonus videos of songs from their other CDs.The Acid House Kings are the #1 pop group in Sweden and for good reason. If only US pop could be this good."
1,This book is missing something - like useful content,"In a 750 page book, you'd think they would have a lot of in-depth information, but this book severly lacks in depth of coverage of every topic. Most concepts are only mentioned in a page or two, then the author moves on to something else. This book is poorly organized and the index uses only the official names for things, making it difficult to find anything. It's easier to find the same information in the Dreamweaver MX help menu. I'll stick with the ""Bible"" series next time."
1,Another Incomplete Reference,"Anyone involved in programming has bought a number of these books. Complete References. Granted, this is not billed as a tutorial, but wouldn't a ""Complete Reference"" take you from uploading a site to creating applications? Doesn't happen. It happens, but only with specific examples at the writer's discression. Cross referencing terms at the end of the book assumes you use the same CF jargon, that if you did speak it, would preclude your need for a fifty dollar book. Now I will look for an O'Reilly book that explains in well constructed English what I need to know to learn ColdFusion."
3,NOT A BIG DEAL,"I am a HUGE KRAFTWERK fan and only bought this CD because it was one of their releases. There is no big deal about this. It contains 5 tracks that have all previously been released. The sleeve says ""The Robots"" is the extended version but is the album version and ""Space Lab"" is said to be a CD version but is the same as the one that appears on ""The Man Machine""."
1,more horrible than words,"This is by far the worst sports game that I have ever played. I would rather play Double Dribble on 8-bit Nintendo. The graphics are ok, but the control is pathetic. You pass it to a teamate, and they pass it right back to you. Why? Also, there is a foul called on nearly every possesion, usually against someone that you're not controlling. I played a game, Houston vs. Duke, and some guy from Houston shot 14 for 14 from the field. I go to the Univ. of Houston, and I know that no one is that good. I rented the games, so I only wasted $6.48, but I beg you to not buy this game. You'll only regret it."
2,Poorly done game,"Although it does have alot of the real teams and players, this game is unrealistic. The player ratings are way off for some players, and in some cases(ie Jason Richardson from MSU) players who are good shooters and players can't make shots and are nearly useless. On the other hand, all you need to do is find a good shooter, even if he is a bad player, and keep shooting threes. If you time it right, you can make every shot. This is a poor simulation game, but could be fun for arcade game fans that don't care about realism. However, it's pretty bad when you can beat Duke by 30 by just shooting threes. With Northwestern."
2,A shame and travesty for Playstation 2,"I rented this game even after reading all of the reviews thinking maybe it would be better than what everyone was saying. So i decided to play my first game as my favorite team, the Boston College Eagles. Thats when i found its first obvious flaw. No, i didnt find this flaw it just stumbled upon me like all of the other ones. None of the numbers were accurate. WHere is the Troy Bell like point guard? I couldnt find it. My first game was against Brown. I became even more irate when Browns point guard could not miss. Every team you play there is always one player who hardly ever misses which is nuts. Also, the foul level is very high which has already been mentioned in other reviews. The stadiums and atmosphere .... And the players faces are just plain scary. It looks like im playing super nintendo not playstatoin 2. ....I wouldn't even rent this ...."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF TRASH,"I would of given this game a 0 if that was an option. This is a horrible game. I cant believe such an expensive system can have such a bad game. It doesnt even have most of the real college player's. This game is pathetic. Is March Madness coming out for ps2. You can trust easports,,,not 989."
1,horrible,"i'm glad i rented this game before i bought it. the graphics are terrible, and the gameplay is the worst i've ever seen in a game. don't rent this game. don't buy this game. mock your friends who wasted[the money] on it. buy FIFA"
2,get NBA Live,"This game, as always, is a huge dissapointment for 989 Studios. The graphics are nowhere near PS2 levels. It looks almost identical to last years PS version. There is no dynasty mode. I played 8 games into a season as a mediocre team and was shooting 87% from the field and 81% from three. Way too easy to make shots for you and your opponent. You can rarely get a rebound in the rare instant you do miss. Also stealing the ball is very easy but way too many fouls are called when the computer is shooting. This may not be the worst game I ever played but it should go down as one of the worst for the PS2. If you are a diehard college basketball fan the try it before you buy it. If you just want a basketball game get NBA Live 2001."
2,989 = Head Games?,"Anyone who has had the misfortune of playing any PC game made by a company called Head Games will know exactly what it's like to play 989's NCAA Final Four 2001 for the Playstation 2. This game looks and plays like it was rushed out the door before it was fully developed and finished. The players move awkwardly, much of the time gliding across the court, and the graphics are, for lack of a better term, bizarre. Everyone from the cheerleaders to the players look like they were mated with praying mantises, then dressed up in baskeball gear and motion captured for the game. Without a doubt, the most infuriating aspect of NCAA FF 2001 is the shoot/rebound button being the same. Grab a rebound, then unintentionally shoot from 90 feet away, over and over again. My suggestion would be to buy EA's superior March Madness 2001 for the PS1, and take advantage of the cleaned up graphics when played through a PS2 console."
1,Terrible,"The worst game on PS2 that I've played yet. I would actually recommend March Madness 2001 for PS1 over this, atleast that's got a sweet Dynasty mode and the graphics are about the same."
2,"Sorry, it's just not very good","I just purchased a PS2 in the midst of March Madness, so of course I couldn't resist this game. Whoops. This game is a big dissapointment. The graphics are mediocre at best, certainly not anything near what the PS2 is capable of, the controls are limited, and the game play is wildly unrealistic (and not even in a just an 'overly arcade' fun way either). Stay clear of it, no matter how much you may be smitten with college ball."
1,"a weak, weak display...","this game is terrible. i didn't enjoy playing any of the sports titles that 989 studios released on the original playstation, but i gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought that maybe they could boost their image via the abilities of the PS2. i was seriously mistaken. Final Four 2001 is horrible. the gameplay is slow and hard to control; the player images are poorly designed, and the commentation .... the high point of the entire game is the actual court; the court looks very realistic, but if you don't want to sit and just look at the camera circling the court them i would seriously reccomend not buying this game. in fact, i wouldn't reccomend even renting this game. and after seeing how weak gameday 2001 and gamebreaker 2001 both are, we ought to boycott 989 studios altogether."
