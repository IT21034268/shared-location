5,Must have!,"All cameras should bring 2 batteries, so a second battery is a must for the Nikons, charges fast and holds okay but not long enough."
1,PT + CP = NG,"The Author likes to write with abbreviated words that no one knows but a few. PT means Physical Training, CP means Corporal Punishment, and NG means Nothing Good. This Morgan thinks that a daily list of his activities makes good short stories and that a lot of such short stories make a good novel. From my point of view, there is only a good enough story in this anthology: ""Mark goes to jail, Part 1"". All the rest... If you like reading about physical training, most of it in mud, you will adore this book. Otherwise, forget it."
3,Better for Group Study,"I am a huge fan of Max Lucado, but not so much of this series for an individual study. However, I believe they would be quite effective as a small group guide. Max provides it all: the portion of God's word (in two translations) pertaining to that day's study, good discussion questions, a short related reading (often from his other works) and related Bible passages for further study.I believe I would have given this at least four stars if I had completed it with a group instead of self-study (I found the questions more discussion-oriented versus self-reflection)."
4,Great management resource,"A recurring theme in this book is Discipline, Quality, and Team. There is more to leading a successful data warehousing project than understanding the technical terminology - although that is covered here as well. What this book brought out to me was data warehousing as a whole - why its necessary, how to plan for it, Return On Investment, and design/collaboration considerations for the management team as well as technical design, detailed implementation and support for the development team. I bought a copy for my technical lead too. I recommend it."
2,Nice case but trays in wrong order - very annoying!,"Over time I have been buying high quality brad point bits and wanted to put them in a high quality box. I should have taken a closer look at the photo before I bought the case. Had I done so I would not have purchased it. I was surprised to find the that the largest bits are in the front row and the smallest ones in the back. I usually use the small to medium sized bit the most and find it annoying that I have to flip to the back row to get to them. And as mentioned by another reviewer, the fact that they aren't connected makes flipping through them a pain in more ways than one, especially with really sharp brad point bits! Don't buy this box unless you only plan to use the larger size drill bits you place in the case."
4,Nice Product - some flaws,"This is a nice drill case, but in my opinion the internal drill holders are not arranged properly. The only way to get to the inner trays is to pry them up with the tips of the drills (which is literally a pain if you are using it for brad point bits!). I have a similar drill case from a different manufacturer, and it uses small metal links between the racks to lift them up when the lid opens. Otherwise, its a good case."
5,Outstanding,"Inexpensive, solid, made in the USA. Holds everything securely when it is folded up and looks good to boot. Just what I wanted."
5,Drill Index,This is a good quality index. The bits fit snug in the right holes. The fit and finish of the index in good. Glad I bought!
4,Truth in advertising,"I have looked for this item locally for a long time, never finding it. Thank you Amazon for carrying this. The quality is better than I expected, and brought attention to the holes in my bit collection (no pun intended). This will make organizing my bits a pleasure."
3,Sleek view crappy keyboard,"I own SZ140p model for about 1 month.Pros:- Screen size and display quality are very nice.- I'm happy with the embedded webcam, it is very convenient to use with a chat client.- Lightweight, think, and sleekCons:- Space key on the keyboard is really annoying. I had it replaced by Sony service but after two days it doesn't work properly again. You have to press hard. I tried several different laptops and they all have the same problem. :(- The battery is slightly loose, and when you're carrying the laptop it feels as if it is very fragile.- Although the harddisk is advertised as 100 GB, it shows around high 80s. It is not that important for me though.I would strongly recommend trying the laptop out at a local store before buying it. When I did it myself, I had the impression that keyboard and loose battery problem pertain to the display model only but I was wrong."
1,Unsatisfied customer.,Enter comment: I bought and paid for this item and received it through my media library. But I am convinced I did not received the entire original article. It has too few words and stops in the middle of a sentence. Could you please arrange to forward me the entire piece or refun my money. Thank you.
5,wonderful,"my 2 year old loves these animals. the aligators are his favorite. Not much to say, except they're very durable and fun. Nice addition to the zoo or ark."
4,Step beyond the beginner's guides,"This book covers so many useful tricks that every iMovie owner should invest in it. Owning Quicktime Pro is essential for many of the tricks - as is paint program - but it's money well spent. Everything from picture-in-picture effects to professional-style cuts and edits are covered in extremely well illustrated step-by-step guides. Of course there are some very cheesy effects that no-one should use in anything other than an ironic style, but there are also essentials such as J and L edits, better titles, overlays.. This book can help postpone the time you need to step up to Final Cut Pro - so effectively you're saving yourself $ ;-)"
4,Great Book!,"The format of the book does an excellent job of separating the ""you can do this ... "" stuff from ""Here's HOW to do this ... "" stuff; something far too few manuals handle well. After a tiny bit of off-line coaching from Sadun (who was very helpful and courteous), I had no difficulty stacking a video clip inside a clip inside another clip, and learned more about QuickTime than I'd ever known before. I found that it is not for a complete novice; the book has some hidden assumptions about the reader's proficiency, mainly that the reader is more proficient than a rank beginner and can leap into the process. All things considered, I am more than satisfied with my purchase!"
2,too busy,"The book was well written and imparted a lot of information. The print was too small. The book was very busy in sections, used too many photos and covered the area in too great a detail,e.g. the chapter on frames."
5,Wonderful CD!!!,God bless the women who put this CD together. I've enjoyed listening to it for almost three years now and never tire of hearing it. Each song carries such an inspirational message and is so uplifting. I whole-heartedly recommend it to every woman who is looking for for a spiritual pick-me-up! What a great CD!
2,Berlitz Portuguese Phrase Book,"A step above the Dover say it series, However this phrase book is not Brazil friendly especially the audio material, I think its odd that Berlitz would not have a Brazilian Portuguese phrase book. Like it does with the Latin american Spanish series. I recommend the Lonely Planet phrase book for Brazilian Portuguese."
3,it is ok,"It is a very basic cd. It is what I was offered, not complaints an not surprices. The vendor did a good job"
5,one of the best Auschwitz books i have read,"i have read several books about the horrible Nazis and this was so very different than the others. ""those who saved us"" had been exceptional.Rena's Promise was so very different and it was amazing that the sisters survived. Don't miss reading this book."
5,Riveting book!,"Rena's Promise: Two Sisters in Auschwitz is one of the best books I ever read about the holocaust. I could not put the book down. It made me feel as if I was actually living through the nightmare of Auschwitz and Birkenau with Rena and her sister, Danka. It is a truly amazing story of Rena's will to survive despite the most horrific conditions a human being could ever have to endure. It is also a story of the extraordinary devotion and love that the two sisters shared and how their deep bond enabled them to survive it all."
4,"Great read, but very bad editing!","This book was great, can't say enough good things about it. However, the editor(s) should be fired! The direction goes from third person to first person within the same sentence sometimes! I even found a few grammatical errors, doubled words, and misspellings. For that, I gave it four stars. The substance does not, in any way, deserve less than five."
2,"Story is good, Kindle version... not so great","This review and the rating relates to the Kindle version and not to the actual book itself.I started reading this book on my kindle and am having a difficult time wading my way through it. It feels like portions of the text are possibly missing? There are a number of grammatical and typographical errors. I'm considering buying the paperback version, but I've already spent the money on the Kindle version. I think in the future I'll definitly do the free 1st chapter download before I purchase the Kindle version of any book."
4,Rena's Promise,Rena's Promise: Two Sisters in Auschwitz is a compelling read from beginning to end. It throws a light on the courage that retelling this story takes and makes you wonder about the stories that were never told.
5,Outstanding,A must read for any citizen of our world. A moving story of this horrific time. Incredible depiction of the human spirit.
4,interesting,"This was a very well written book about two sisters' experience in Auschwitz. Written with a lot of heart, great detail and stories we haven't heard before. Such admirable women!"
5,Rena's Promise Confronting,I couldn't put this book down. Confronting and factual yet well written. It has given me an insight as to the terrible occurrences in WW11.
2,Informative but annoying,The book is somewhat informative though I seriously dislike the writer style of glorifying Rena.I regretted buying this book.
5,Amazing and captivating book!,After starting this book I could barely put it down! An amazing story of survival and close calls! Their Facebook is awesome also
5,Touching and deeply disturbing...,"This book shocked me into consciousness of how much evil human beings are possible of creating. Of course I knew of the holocaust and that people died, but not until I read this book and really got to 'be' there did it dawn on me how truly devastating this period of history is. And the strength that Rena and Danka have to survive this horror is nothing short of amazing. They shouldn't be alive, but they are, and it's a small light of success in the ocean of evil that the holocaust was. This book is very well written and really put me there with them. I couldn't put it down. I think that this is a story everyone should hear so we never forget what happened and hope we NEVER let it happen again."
4,the power of a promise,"I recently bought the Kindle edition and enjoyed it very much. This is a powerful and moving story which is well written and engaging. Rena's experiences and ability to recreate incredibly touching images of her life at Auswchwitz/Berkenau were very impressive. My only complaint, which may be specific to the Kindle version, is that there were several typos in the text and a couple of times the tense unexpectedly changed from 1st person to 3rd within the main body of the story (it starts and ends in 3rd person). In a story as important as this one, I hate to see these technical glitches detracting from the message."
5,"A testimony of love, survival and triumph","By: Joe E. WhiteRena's Promise is the beautifully told story of two remarkable young women in their early twenties who endure and survive nearly three and one half years as prisoners of the Nazis in Auschwitz and Ravensbruck. The love that Rena has for her younger sister, Danka, sustains her and helps her to endure the atrocities and indignities forced upon them on a daily basis by the Nazis.During the time they are prisoners, Rena never once forgets the promise to her mother to take care of her younger sister. There are numerous times when Rena unhesitatingly gives up her daily crust of bread in exchange for medicine or a much needed salve for Danka. And at times when Rena is able to ""organize"" an extra tidbit of food such as a tiny piece of potato peeling, she meticulously divides it and without exception shares it with her beloved sister.Although Rena is the stronger of the two sisters, Danka's strength emerges during the death march."
3,"Amazing story, needs to be re-edited","Started out very iffy. The author kept bouncing from 1st person to 3rd every few paragraphs, and was so confusing at first that I almost did not continue. There are several misspelled words along with double inserted words throughout the beginning of the book. Glad I continued, the author finally got it together and kept the 1st person scenario throughout the middle of the story and was much easier to read. The story was horrific and heartbreaking and must not be forgotten, just needs to be re-edited and glad I got it on the free list while it was still available.."
5,Survival in Auschwitz,"Rena Kornreich was 19 years old when the Nazis swept into Poland. She recounts her experiences under the brutal Nazi occupation of Poland, and her deportation, along with her younger sister Danka, in March 1942. to Auschwitz, where in harrowing detail she tells of the horrifying conditions there, and the preverse cruety of the Nazis.She tells of her promise to stand by her sister to the end, and describes the gas chambers and the cruel experiments on Jewish girls and women by Mengele.She recounts the logic of Nazi genocide...how any consistent Nazi plan had to traget Jewish women specifically as women., for they were the only ones who would be able to ensure the continuation of Jewish life.There is sound evidence that the odds for surviving the Holocaust were worse for Jewish women than Jewish men.[...]Rena tells how she and her sister survived against the odds, and the epilogue tells of the lives of those who survived, and their experiences after the war."
3,"Needs editing, especially first third of book","I am so glad I struggled though the first third of this book and hung in there. It is almost as if the remainder of the book was written by another author. The story, Rena's story, is exceptional and worth the challenge of the initial lack of editing.This is a story that shows just how much the will to live can make a difference. Rena was unfailing in her committment to get her sister home alive, and to do that Rena had to also keep herself alive. This led to constantly evaluating the situation and events around her. An example is Rena's time spent ""organizing"" (scavaging, trading, collecting) which helped Rena on several occasions.Rena's ability to remain fairminded and generous in her circumstances was inspirational. When Rena could share she shared and when she could help someone else she did. Remarkable story of courage and dedication."
5,Amazing Rena and amazing struggle to live,"It's my #5 book on memoirs of the Holocaust. All of them I discovered right here, on Amazon.The first one was ""Thanks to my Mother"" by Shoshana Rabinovici about life and survival by a minute in the Vilna Ghetto. Then was ""Alicia"", ""Cage""...Rena and Danka are two sisters in Poland. Rena promised their mother to be with her littler sister and watch her. And all she was doing in Auswitz was to keep Danka alive. Amazing woman and very very street smart. There were so many situations where most people would loose the will to live, but Rena kept finding the ways to save herself and Danka at the last split of a second. Over two years to be in the Death camp and survive!An amazing Courage to fight for Life!An amazing example for us all!"
5,Heart-warming & heart-breaking all at the same time.,This was the best book I have ever read. Rena is so awesome to write her story down so everyone can see what she went through. I couldn't put this book down the first time I read it. I have read this book over 20 times because it is so extrordinary. I recommend that everyone read this book. It will show how prejudice and hate can ruin your life. Read it!
5,Beautifully written story,"Last eyar I went to e Holocaust Museaum in Washington DC with my organization. My grandfather was directly involved in the holocaust, and I was very anzious to visit. A firend bought this book for me att he end of our tour, I read it in about two hours. It broke my heart, and filled me with joy when I read the ending and learned about Rena's and Danka's liberation. I HIGHLY recommend you read this book, it not only fills you with insight on what people went through at camps, but you're are placed in the story as if you were there. Its a wonderful book. Read it!"
5,Can't put this book down!,"I could not put this book down. Yes it has some editing issues, but they are so easy to overlook when it comes to how compelling the story is. Rena's story is told with a simple honesty and it is easy to imagine oneself in her situations. This book should be required reading in High Schools, as we can never and should never forget what we as human beings are capable of. The book shows we are capable both of tremendous evil and tremendous hope and resilience."
5,Sad but fantastic,"This is a great book. If you are interested in Nazi history, you should read this book. Rena is an incredible person and more people should know her story. I read this book in under 2 days, I couldnt put it down!"
1,A Cursory Account,"Frequently Holocaust survivors claim that Josef Mengele himself personally examined them upon arrival at Auschwitz (Finkelstein, p. 82). Also, often survivors say that they had direct encounters while the most infamous of the guards and the beautiful, but rapacious Irma Grese equally often is named as the evil woman they had to deal with. So again we read of such an encounter in Rena Kornreich Gelissen's memoir. However, for such a horrible experience, the account is reduced to a cursory, almost superficial, analysis. Alas, to firmly grasp the more diabolical and insidiously evil persona of Grese, one would be better served to examine ""The Beautiful Beast: The Life & Crimes of SS-Aufseherin Irma Grese."""
1,Poor video quality and overdubbed music,"All episodes of the first season and many episodes of the second season are in the public domain because CBS bought the rights to the series shortly after its cancellation and forgot(!) to renew their copyrights.As a result, these episodes have been unofficially released on DVD by many low-budget labels and rerun on budget networks on 16mm prints. It is very obvious that this DVD set was made from the inferior 16mm prints. There are annoying scratches, lines and skips throughout every episode.The original theme music has also been replaced by hokey-sounding generic music due to copyright issues. After watching 3 or 4 episodes in a row, this music will really grate on your nerves.Save your hard earned money and watch for Paramount/Viacom to eventually release the ""official"" versions."
2,Copy protected to uselessness,The copyright protection on the cd has prevented it from being used on all but one cd player that I've tested (my girlfriends car). In order to use it on a computer you have to agree to the download of a music player included on the cd (with no documentation) that prevents you from making an MP3 out of it. Nice waste of money.
4,A great read!,It shows that a bad situation can turn into something great. Funny and could happen to anyone. I would recommend it to any age.
3,"Light, Entertaining Read","This was a good light read, if you are just looking for something to pass that time you will enjoy this book. It wasn't especially funny or terribly deep, but it will keep your attention for a couple of days. I would consider reading other Stephanie Bond books after reading this one. For the reviewer who said the language was ""coarse"", well I can't imagine how, prime-time TV is more offensive."
3,Toody61,"This is a ""cute"" story of betrayal that takes one surprising turn after another. Not the typical ""bigamist-discovered"" tale that we have come to expect. However, for $1.99 on Amazon's budget electronic list, an enjoyable respite from the usual mystery."
4,Our Husband,"What a funny read, was a bit of an unbelievable story but sometimes it is good to read a light easy book."
5,Easy funny read!,"Lots of laughs and very entertaining. Actually a really good story, which I wasn't expecting. End up loving all the characters"
5,cute,I liked the direction this book went.I pictured Kathleen Turner as Beatrix and Gerald Butler as Brian . i cant wait to read other books.
4,Our Husbands,"I haven't quite finished it yet, but up to this point, I really like it. It is very easy to read and holds your interest."
2,trite,"This book was standard rodramedy (I just made that word up)....scorned women, big hunk comes to save the day, murder mystery...blah, blah,blah."
1,Waste of money,"I can't believe I paid 99 cents for this one. I've enjoyed other romantic mysteries by this author, but I just couldn't get into this one. I never made it past the three wives at the hospital. It's high star rating deceived me."
3,A nice read..,"""our husband"" is the first book I've read by stephanie bond and I really like her way to write.This is a fun book to read but not very serious.I liked the elder wife most. and the second, least because she seemed the most melancholy and the one we are supposed be sorry about the situation she in? I may not make sense here, but when I read I got the feeling that I don't like her much. and I really don't know why that guy fell for her!! She is very mean to him, partly I understand but...argh!I even liked her brother more, I wonder if there's a story about him?"
3,Good except for one place,"This book was really good... until the sex scene (which is the only place that defines this book as ""romantic""). I mean, really. Sex scenes ARE NOT necessary to ANY plot! Because of that, I won't be reading any more of Stephanie Bond's books."
2,Why I would not recommend this book,While the story line was enjoyable it could have been told just as vividly without the coarse language. Because of this I will not be looking at other stories by this author.
1,Our Husband,"This book stinks. Very poor writing, as if the author knows nothing about character or plot development. Pages and pages of drivel. No intrigue. No comedy. It's NOT funny -- and she does NOT approximate Evanovich, as stated in your advertisement. This book should never have left the publisher's desk. It simply stinks."
1,annoying,I am an avid reader and very rarely will I not finish a book. I stopped reading this book about a third into it because I found all the characters so pathetic and annoying.
3,QUICK REED,"This book is a quick read, has some funny moments, characters are not too believable but a fun read with a surprise ending."
4,Unexpected,"This plot had a more twists and turns than a maze. Great relationships forged by adversity. I thoroughly enjoyed the read, just wish it could have lasted longerThe ending left room for a sequel???"
4,Cute story,I found this story of women rather funny. I liked the way they interacted and eventually became friends. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a clean book.
2,Not for me!,Couldn't get past page 10! Silly. In fact can't even get to the no of words required for the review!!
5,Witty romantic mystery,Three engaging women draw the reader into a mystery with several twists and turns. Humor and good writing make this book a fast read.
3,Entertaining light read,"This is the story of three women who discover they were each married to the same man. All three become suspects when the husband dies and is thought to have been murdered. The women then come together to try and find the identity of the murderer.The book is described as a ""humourous, romantic mystery"" and, in my opinion, it is all three of those things, although perhaps a little lean in the romantic department. The main characters are likeable and the story entertaining with a few plot twists.Overall, an enjoyable read."
4,Twists and turns,Amazon thank you .... From start to finish I was hooked ever wanting to know who and how.... I then wondered how many people in the world do not know what their husband is up too.. or wife for that matter. The characters were believable all with their own personalities and suspicion over their heads.. I do not want to get too much away however I am sure if you read this book you will agree - Stephanie Bond is a very talented writer.
4,men,Fun story. Moves fast and holds ones interest. Have read other books by this author and will look for more by this same writter.
4,Hilarious,"Very fast read, enjoyed it immensely! Recommend for a rainy afternoon and getting a few good laughs. Could not put it down."
3,Easy simple read,It's advertised as humorous but I couldn't find any humor in it.It's a simple easy read when all you need is to clear your mind.
4,Our Husband,Our Husband was an easy read that kept me interested and entertained all the way through. Recommend it to anyone.
2,a waste of $,"I was drawn into this story based on the preview and the ratings. Unfortunately, after the first few chapters, there wasn't much comedy or romance. It just seemed to drag. I'm just glad I didn't pay full price.I gave it 2 stars for effort."
3,very entertaining,I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book..It was light reading but very entertaining..maybe a little predictable but still enjoyed it.
5,Sooooooo funny!,"This was a fun read. I really enjoyed this book and have recommended it to many of my friends. I have now started reading Stephanie Bond books, but so far this one is my favorite. Awesome!"
4,Always a good read,I love Stephanie Bonds books. This one I've read twice. Light and fun. I recently introduced my mom to them and she likes them too.
4,Fun read. I will buy more of her books.,I was looking for something light and easy to read before I fall asleep. This book was perfect for that. It's not a great work of fiction but it was fun and I have bought more of this author's books because I liked it so much.
3,Had potential,"It was a lighthearded book that had the potential to be really funny. Just when it lost my attention one of the characters would do or say something funny, then it was gone. It was a good book but easy to forget."
4,Our husband,Our Husband had me hooked to the very end. It was an easy read. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.
4,Our husband,realy enjoyed this book real people and real life humour and a good storykept your attention all through highly recommend this book for light reading
4,light hearted read,"Light hearted, entertaining read. The ending was a little cliche and ""wrapped in a pretty bow"" for my taste, but as I said, its a light hearted book."
4,Quick read,"Enjoyed this book. It was a quick and easy read. More importantly, it kept your attention and the suspense until the very end!"
4,Read this book!,Very charming and funny read. Book held my interest. I enjoyed the chemistry anddifferences between the three very different women.
4,Hilariously who-done-it that made me laugh out!,"My husband bought me a Kindle Fire for XMas and I have not stopped reading books since I got it. While I would look for new books at the Kindle Store I kept running across Stephanie Bond's ""Our Husband,"" and decided to read it. From the time I opened the book until the last page I could not put the book down. I was captivated by the way it made me laugh, all the while trying to figure out who the killer was. I had never read one of Stephanie Bond's books but cannot wait to read another one. If you want a light funny mystery romance to read then this your book. Loved it!"
3,Not a page turner,It was OK. I had no problem however putting it down and not picking it up again but my daughter had recommended it and felt I should finish it. It had some humorous moments.
3,Slow start but improves with time,Some interesting twists and turns in plot. Fairly predictable character behaviors at times. Ok ending.Am looking for another author of Sandra Brown's caliber. Haven't found one yet though.
3,Lite easy reading,"Book was predictable but enjoyable. Lite, easy reading withhumor. It was what I expected and wanted for an easy fast read."
2,"Light, easy to read",Lighthearted easy to read. Quite rpedicitable and characters not always believable and not much substance but it is a a good holiday read for the beach
2,So-so,"I didn't think it was all that great. From previous reviews/comments, it sounded very funny, but it seemed rather boring to me. I finished it, but I was glad when it was over."
3,Our Husband????,"I enjoyed portions of the story but found other sections annoying at best. Beatrix as the menopausal wife (only actual wife) was entertaining and believable with her reactions. Ruby's reactions were also believable mainly because of her low expectations from life in general. Natalie was the one I couldn't understand. Smart, independant yet she jumped from one relationship that was supposedly stable if beginning to pale slightly into a physical relationship with a virtual stranger while still proclaiming intense love for the man she thought was her husband. Legalities not-withstanding, she either loved him or she didn't."
3,Not What Expected,"This book had mystery, but not much comedy unless you consider the odd characters. It did show that people can change for the better. The plot was a little “over the top"" in believe ability and was a little too slow paced at times."
3,An unusual bond,Toss together by a common husband three very different women embark on a journey to find his killer.It was entertaining enough and the wives' relationships are the funniest parts yet the characters never reach their full potential and remain very cliche.
4,Great light read!,"I thought this was very entertaining and a very fun and different kind of story than I am used to reading. I really recommend it, especially for a vacation-type read."
5,Would recommend,"I would definitely recommend this book. In fact, I have been to my friends. Its a really good mystery, but is pretty funny, too. The 3 main characters form a strange ""friendship"" to locate the person that killed the man that married all 3 of them & stole from them. None of them really like each other, considering the circumstances, but stick together to find the killer. I will continue to recommend this book to everyone; men, women, whoever."
4,Good book.,Enjoyable and held my interest. You grew to like even the craziest characters. A page-turning easy read. Would definitely recommend.
3,Hmmmm,It was fine as far as it goes. The first half meandered on & on and then everything just resolved it self very quickly. Thought there was more of a story in there and in the end it was treated almost as a short story in the end. Characters were okay but even the conflict between them just seemed to go away - I'll just say superficial story and move on
3,A good mystery,The story was entertaining but not a thriller that I couldnt put down. I will read a few more books by this author.
3,Relatively entertaining,"I'm only half way through the book, but I can say that I find the three main characters interesting. Their personalities are well written and believable. I'm a tough person to please with books, but if I wasn't liking this book I would have stopped reading it. My rating my increase after I finish the book...we'll see!"
3,I liked it!,This was a fun read. I particularly enjoyed the characters of the 3 wives...I hope the author writes a sequel!
4,Our Husband,"This was a light hearted, easy read book. The story was somewhat predictable but still fun to read. Good book for a rainy day by the fireplace."
5,Very Enjoyable!,"I really enjoyed this book. I found myself not knowing exactly who to root for! Definately a book I would recommend, but only if you have time to read the whole thing, because you won't want to put it down."
4,Good story but wasn't funny,"I don't know if I just lost my sense of humor during this read or what but I didn't laugh once. There were a few cute moments, enough to make me smile, but I wouldn't have called this ""humorous"".I WOULD call it a great story, completely different from anything I've read lately. I am definitely a Stephanie Bond fan now!"
3,Light read but neither romantic nor a comedy,"I would categorize this story as a light mystery with a (VERY) little romance and mildly humorous characters. This is the story of three women who find out they are married to the same man just before he dies of mysterious causes. It is told from all three of the character's points of view (rotating at each chapter). I found the first wife completely unlikeable and the third wife pathetic. The second wife, the main character, was relatable but she did things that I would like to believe that no rational person would ever do, like telling the police that she is going to kill her husband. The police were inept and irritating and so were the lawyers. Mostly, the story was depressing.I think I would have enjoyed this book a lot more if it had simply been told from the point of view of the middle wife and spent more time developing the characters of her brother and the hero. It was well written and I saw no typos."
4,Our husband!!,Very good book. Not a typical boring ending. Enjoyed the plot and really loved all the characters. I would definitely reccommend it.
3,Our Husband,This book was not as funny as I thought it would be..It was good for a light read in the summer.I probably would not have paid full price for it.
3,mystery addict,This book is OK if you need a late night read because you cannot sleep. Not very well crafted but at least not as sloppy and soppy as some hack jobs.
5,Good Mystery,I'm always looking for a new mystery author to read and this book was funny and a good twist to the story. I will definitely read more of Stephanie Bond.
3,Our Husband,"The plot didn't hold me enought to have finished the book yet. It may be that I'm too busy at the moment, but there are always those books you can't put down, and this is not one of them. It is entertaining, but I don't see the comedy in someone being arrested for something she didn't do."
3,average book,average book - glad it was cheap - kindle does not work - web site does not work = what a waste of time
4,Good read,"good read, light and entertaining. Once I started I did not want to put the bood down. Interesting to the last page."
3,Not as funny...,I was sold on the idea that this was a funny novel. Did not find it so... but does entertain.
4,interesting twists,I found this a story with a interesting twist and hard to put down. I enjoyed it. kept my interest from the start and kept me guessing who did what.
2,Slightly Boring,"I bought this book thinking that I could use a light, good humored read after the last few reads being some rather serious, historical fiction. What a disappointment. To say that there are any ""laugh out loud"" passages is completely not true. The premise is implausible, the plot is lame, and the characters are not believable or well developed. The book skips from one woman's view to another's in a confusing format. I'll see it to the end, as I always do, and glad that the price was cheap. How this one stayed in the Top 100 for any length of time is any true reader's guess."
1,Our Husnabd,"Again, I did not order this book.You need to check your records as to what I have ordered. You may find thaT THEY WERE ORDEREDON THE nUMBER one KINDLE AND iT IS not MINE."
3,"Not a Great Book, Just OK",The premise of this book had potential but it did not live up to it. I read it hoping it would get better. It was just ok.
3,Easy read,"Cute, but rather silly story about three random women who have no idea their husband is having all these affairs."
3,Our Husband,The book was well written but has an unrealistic plot. The characters are somewhat unbelieveable. I would not recommend this book to my friends.
3,Our Husband,It was short and a quick read. The book was entertaining but not what you would consider a page turner.
4,Fun Read,This was a fun read! It was highly entertaining and kept me guessing right up to the very end! I am looking forward to reading more of her novels.
1,An author to forget,"I rarely buy a book without reading the reviews, and after having bought this one without doing so, will never make the same mistake again. What a load of unrealistic rubbish. Besides the weak storyline, the weak and unbelievable characters, the errors made by the author cannot be overlooked. Example: Beatrix was 10 years older than Raymond, yet met him while a debutante? Debutantes are usually around the age of 18 which would have made her somewhat of a cradle snatcher marrying an 8 year old. Even though I only paid $2.99 I feel ripped off. I will avoid this author at all costs in future."
2,Uninspiring and not humorous,"This story felt like a lame joke that never for to the punch line. There was some relatable character material in the middle wife, but all other characters felt stilted and two-demensional. I didn't find the story to be humorous or suspenseful."
3,OUr husboand,This book was an easy one to read that had a very predictable outcome. The plot of the story is very simplistic.
4,Our Husband ( a clever story),We enjoyed this book a lot (husband and wife).don't always agree on books. This one was a lotof fun to read. Re book Our Husband.
2,our husband,This is like reading a comic./ tabloidcomplete rubbish of no substanceonly kept reading to see if it was a joketotally predictable ending
3,our husband,"I am enjoying reading this story because I can pick it up when I have time and there is not a lot of detail to remember, i.e. it's easy reading. Having said that, there's nothing really to get your teeth into but it's a fairly humorous story and it doesn't ""tax the brain""."
2,Came So Close,"I got this book because it sounded like it would be funny. It started out that way, and I had high hopes for the rest of the book. However, once the husband was dead and found to be murdered, it went downhill.The characters could have been likeable, but I feel like the author tried too hard. The doctor is a decent character, but the socialite and the stripper come across more as caricatures than characters. The socialite has no idea of how the ""little people"" live and the stripper is written as a stereotypical redneck.Worst of all, the mystery never seems to go anywhere. I feel like the author needed reasons for each wife to be arrested, so she threw in things. Sadly, those things are not very believable. *SPOILER ALERT* And the wives don't even solve the crime themselves. The killer comes after them. *END SPOILER ALERT*I got through about 2/3 of the book before I just could not take any more. I finally skipped to the end to see who the killer was (which came out of nowhere)."
4,A cute storyline,"I enjoyed the writing style and characters in this book. I didn't see the twist of the ending coming. Funny and touching, this author brought together 3 very different women into a difficult situation and entertained me throughout her story. I kept wondering when things would clear up and how. I recommend this book."
4,Funny!,I really enjoyed this book. it is very funny and well written with a happy ending! i cant wait to read more books from this author
4,fun,This was a light hearted surprise. The characters were developed in a fashion that one felt like they might have known someone like them in their own life.
3,easy fast read,"One man living a lie until he suddenly dies. It is a surprise to all when three women show up at the hospital, each claiming to be his wife..."
3,fun with husbands,A fun read. Kept thinking about people I knew. Wondered who could pull this off and who was dumb enough to have it happen to her.
5,Gasping and laughing at the same time!,This was such a funny and exciting read. The twist and turns as the story unfolds and these three women are forced together will have you laughing out loud. The adventure was far from an ordinary mystery which made it unpredictable---just the way a good book should be.
2,Our husband (a humorous romantic mystery) by Stephanie Bond,"Very light reading, sort of fun, bit of fantasy. Never quite understood how 3 wives were called to the hospital, or why the police investigating the death were so slow. Requires suspension of disbelief."
3,our husbands,"Our husbands was fun to read. It wouldn't be given an award, but fast and fun reading in the summertime."
3,Every mans dream,This was a good story. I suppose part of it has happened somewhere in the world. I had a few laughs reading it
2,Funny,This book was funny but a little hard to get through. No hot scenes involved here but if you like the Stephanie Plum type humor then this book would be a good choice for you.
2,Shallow story,"Not well written, not well researched, not plausible. There are entertaining and even hilarious scenes though. I bought it because I thought the idea was interesting, but I was disappointed with how the topic was treated."
4,Funny,"Three women married to the same man. He didn't know how to say no. Old and rich wife, middle aged wife, and young barely out of her teen bra wife who's pregnant. A cop who thinks they all killed the husband. You will be surprised at who actually killed the husband. The story is about how these women bond together to try to find the person that killed their husband."
1,could have been better,"This book was not my cup of tea - maybe it's yours? I thought the title promised more than was delivered. It's an undemanding read - a book for the beach perhaps, because the sun oil and sand would not matter - it's not a keeper."
4,Entertaining.....,Time on treadmill passed quickly! An easy read. Could prove a lesson for some.. men and women. Good read.@
2,Lacks the humor,Did not like this book! Does not live up to what it promises on the cover! See no humor in the story of a cheating husband!
3,It was a nice quick read,"But nothing to brag about. I expected the story to be a little more interesting or funny for that matter, and instead I got a smile here and there and no burning desire to want to know more. It was a ice quick Read and that's that."
4,ENJOYED THIS BOOK,"I am not a morning person... but I have to give this book a lot of credit. I actually laughed out loud while reading this book at 6 in the morning. I never do that! It is a fun read! If you want a lot of depth, not going to happen... but I love the humor! So yes, I am going to continue to read her books. Thanks Ms. Bond for the entertainment!I really enjoyed this book. It was interesting and entertaining. However, it was neither particularly humorous nor a romance."
3,Cute story.,Thought this was a cute story but a little predictable. Characters were interesting and the story kept my interest. Would definitely read other novels by Stephanie Bond.
4,Cute fun,"The book was well written, kept me interested. Fun, light plot - was frivolous, nothing serious. But just what I needed to give me a break from school books! Would read something from her again."
5,funny,"The mix of humor and thriller is perfect! While reading, I feel part of the story and the tension keeps you reading on and on. This is definitely a book that should be read not only by women! Stephanie Bond enters my list of favourite writers! Thanks a lot!Lily"
4,Really good read,"This books kept me reading way into the night to find out ""Who dun it"". Very funny and enjoyable book."
3,"Okay book for $.99, Seems Drawn Out","Frankly for $.99 this book isn't bad. It has some great parts where you do feel invested in the story or find yourself laughing out loud. However, I felt there weren't enough of those moments to make it a truly great read. There were times where I found myself thinking: ""Seriously? Another twist? Get on with it already!"" Which may sound silly, as it is supposed to be a mystery novel, but I felt like it played out like a t.v. show that needed the constant cliffhangers or twists to bring viewers back for the next episode. Overall I did enjoy the book, I just think Ms. Bond could have left out some of the junk in order to better develop the characters and main plot line. All of the extra subplots seemed to bog down the book as it went on. Like I said, a decent read for $.99, but it isn't one I would go back and read again or pay more for."
3,I Must Be Missing Something,Cute. That's the most I can say for this novel. I must be missing something I didn't find anything to laugh out loud over. It is entertaining but easy to know how it will end. It is getting harder to find a novel that does not spill the beans way too early. Not in a hurry to get her next novel.
4,Great book,"This book started off slow for me (which is why I gave four starts instead of 5) but after the characters were all introduced and the mystery started, I could not put it down. This is a great book because it is a mixture of mystery, romance and comedy and can appeal to any reader. Deffinitely recommend reading this book!"
5,Great Read!!,"I absolutely loved this story. This was an excellent light read, especially for the summer, when you just want to sit back, relax and take nothing seriously. Ms. Bond is a wonderful writer creating memorable characters. 5 stars."
3,"It was ok, but just ok","Nothing special. Its a quick read, and entertaining. I read on my bus rides to and from work, so it kept me occupied."
4,Our Husband,"Interesting characters, good solid read with a few great moments. I found it entertaining and it kept my interest, but I could still put it down every once in awhile."
4,Not what I expected,This didn't go exactly how I planned but I thought it was a pretty good book. It was worth the price to me as I love to read...
4,Our Husband,This book was a great light read. I actually liked the characters so it made it more fun. Humorous and a sweet ending.
5,OUR HUSBAND,I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT WAS FUNNY AND EXCITING AND YOU WERE SITTING ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT. A VERY GOOD READ.
2,Fun read,"A fun read but not great literature. The plot is well structured but the prose is shallow. Enjoyed it all the same. A quick, fun read. Glad I didn't pay a lot of money for it."
3,Our Husband,"This is a cute story about 3 women divided by their common husband who pull together for mutual good. It was an easy read, good for relaxing."
4,Fun read,"This books was an enjoyable, quick read. The wives were all very different from each other. The chaos that their lives became as a result of their husband wouldn't be entertaining if you we're living it yourself, but it was entertaining in a book. There's some mystery involved too, for those who need that in a book. I'd recommend."
4,A Stephanie Bond Fan,"I absolutely love pretty much everything Stephanie Bond writes, so this book delivered another hillarious read that was hard to put down."
5,twists and turns,"Great fun read. Just when you think you have worked out what is going on it all changes again. Really good writing, and lots of laughs in between."
2,It's boring,I don't connect with any of the characters and I find the book to be a bit boring. Not her best writing
4,Our Husband,It was quite good. You never knew what to expect. He seemed the perfect person for all three women who were very different from each other. It was amazing that he chose such different types of women. He had to have known that eventually he would get caught especially since all the women were ending up in debt (that was bound to show up sometime being that the bills were mounting up and he was pawning items). It is no wonder he had a heart attack. I liked that the three women didn't like each other in the beginning (which is natural) but became friends. I also liked the fact that the one woman fell in love especially after being burned by the husband.
2,Escapism perhaps?,A super light comedy - could not relate to the first nor third wives at all - the second wife's character & situation a little more believable and I would have enjoyed a more in depth story about her with a lot less emphasis on the hardened first wife and the ditsy third wife. Too light for me.
4,our husband,Good light reading mystery and humorous book to take on a holiday. Well organized and easy to pick up and put down
4,husbands,"It was funny and a bit unreal, but made for an entertaining light read. I personally know my husband of 47 years so well that I have a hard time swallowing some of the wives nieve lives. Still it was fun to read."
5,Our Husband,"This is a great book. It had both humor and intrigue, with a touch of romance. It was easy to read and kept my interest. I was surprised by the ending. I would read more of Stephanie Bond"
4,Fast Read,Cute story. Fast read. Kept me guessing until the end. I enjoyed this book and plan to read more from this author.
4,Light reading and a lot of fun,"I just finished reading ""Our Husband"", and I'm glad I did. The book is well written, and the 3 female characters become YOUR friends somewhere along the way. You will be sympathetic to Natalie, Beatrix will annoy you, and Ruby will tickle your funny bone. This is not the type of compelling story to finish up in one night. It can be read at your leisure here and there when you have a few moments to enjoy yourself."
3,easy read,Enjoyable we book..had it on the kindle on my mob..easy read...have bought a few more books of this author...light entertainment.....
4,Great character development,"Many stories are written from the perspective of the heroine, or victim or detective. This story is written from the perspective of all three heroine/victims. I found the novel a mesmerizing train wreck in the first part of the book and then just flat out fun after that."
2,Quick & Easy,"This was a fun easy read. It has a cheesy ending, but it kept me wanting to read throughout the book. I don't know if I'd consider this book ""humorous""."
5,Awesome Book!,I love Stephanie Bond and this book lives up to her creative writing--I couldn't put it down! I highly recommend it...the only downfall is there weren't enough pages...
4,fun!,If you're looking for a fun easy read this fits! It will make you laugh - without a doubt! Enjoy
5,Great read from beginning to end,"This book was a great mix of comedy, romance, and mystery. From beginning to end it kept you laughing and wondering ""who dunnit"". The characters were multi dimensional and easy to love (and hate sometimes)! A great quick read."
3,Thrilling book,Thrilling and humorous book. Keeps reader going all the way to the end. The friendship that was forge by the characters were not all believable.
4,A Fun Read,"I have always loved Stephanie Bond books and this one does not disappoint. It is an easy read with just the right amount of mystery and humor. You don't have to be a ""rocket scientist"" to read this book and just enjoy. The characters are fun and the plot is entertaining."
4,Funny Premise with Unexpected Twists,"Three women find out that they are married to the same man when they are all notified that he is in the hosptital. The First Wives Club meets Thelma and Louise in this truly funny whodunit. A light, lovely, tightly written book."
4,fun easy read,Enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend this book to others who enjoy a Janet Evanovich style. I will be looking for other titles by this author.
2,Not Difficult to Put Down,I picked this up after finishing Connie Shelton's Charlie Parker and Samantha Sweets series. Our Husband was easy to put down to go do something else unlike the Shelton books. Our Husband's plot is interesting and I liked the characters well enough. It was just put-downable.
4,Quick read,Very enjoyable- glad my husband picked it. It would be a great beach or vacation read. Like able characters & unique plot.
4,fun,not realistic but was a good funny read. I would recommend it to people wanting easy reading with a cup of coffee
3,Our Husband (a humorous romantic mystery),Just an okay read for me on this one. A couple of really annoying characters plus a pretty unbelievable plot.
4,Entertaining,"I wouldn't call this book ""laugh out loud"" because there really wasn't anything funny in it. I mean, it wasn't a humorous read like Janet Evanovich, but the story was really cute, the book was well written, and the characters well developed and likeable. Each woman took a journey that made them better people, and the ending romance was satisfying. All in all I recommend this book."
4,Amusing entertaining & a surprise ending,"I thought 'Our Husband' was quite good, I found I did not want to put my Kindle down as the story worked towards it's completion.As I read for relaxation & often an escape from reality, I found 'Our Husband' contained all the elements I like when I read a book.While the situation seemed beyond reality the author made it seem perfectly feasible. Very readable & entertaining."
5,Great Product.,Works excellent. No noise at all. Helped alot esp during this last winter. Thanks alot will buy again from you guys.
3,not bad,is not a kind of book for personal study. be sure that you have a tutor while using this book.
3,IT'S THE ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT CHICKEN WING!,"The 50's was a time when no bug was safe from becoming the next giant menace to society. 'The Deadly Mantis' is a fairly good entry in this series but, not the best. The mantis itself is a little stiff in most scenes but, that isn't really the problem. It's just been done better in 'Them' and 'Tarantula'. There is some unintentional laughter to be had when the giant Mantis roars, you will recognize the sound as it was later used on ""The Munsters"" for their fire breathing pet Dragon who lived under the staircase! ....Here Spot! Here Boy.....LOL! If you are like me and can't resist these old B Sci-Fi flicks than you will be pleased to know this is available on Ultimate Sci-Fi classic collection volume 2. The DVD transfer is very good and there are a total of 5 films in the set."
4,Two wings and a prayer (or is it four wings?),"Despite the hokey appearance, this one isn't bad. The mantis is realistic, he's not bulletproof and he really just wants to be allowed to get back to the tropics. STEREOTYPE ALERT: Keep your eyes open (and your ears closed) for our female co-star, who seems to find a reason to scream everytime the rest of the cast runs out of things to say."
5,CREATURE DOMANATON,"THIS IS NOT THE TYPICAL FARE. NO BOMBS OR ATOMIC FOOD. JUST GLOBAL WARMING TREND. THIS IS ONE TO LOOK OUT FOR. AS GOOD AS THIS IS. (STOCK AIR FORCE FOOTAGE,) PLEASE SEE THE MST3K VERSION. SOME FUN WITH THE LITTLE PEOPLE. CAN MAKE A NITE OF IT."
3,Better than most 50's sci-fi monsters...,"I found this to be an entertaining black and white sci-fi effort. The 'Deadly Mantis' effects were above par for this type of film. The film kicks off with plenty of stock footage and in-depth description on the workings and locations of what was state of the art radar technology in 1950's USA.The special effects used include a combination of miniature sets and rear projection which comes off quite well. The effects never stooped to using footage of a real praying mantis matted in to the live action like in Peter Graves' giant grasshopper flick Beginning Of the End. In many scenes a large, animated, puppet-style mantis figure is used to create a more realistic effect when it interacts with the human characters.The acting and storyline are very typical of a 50's giant bug sci-fi flick. I was not disappointed with the flick, and while it's not Harryhausen, it still does the job on a rainy Saturday afternoon!!"
3,Okay for a laugh,"This was the first b movie i ever saw and i've been hooked ever since. Although not the best b movie i've seen, it's not a total rip-off. the beginning is boring, but the 50-foot mantis is hilarious. the funniest part was that they wanted you to believe that there were volcanoes in the north pole."
4,A 4 for What it Could be,"This book is a bit of a mixed bag. The basic story is solid and entertaining. The characters are for the most part well-written. The dialogue is even good. But the devil is in the details. 3 masquerades in as many weeks? There were other issues too, awkward sexual tension mixed with somewhat childish descriptions made certain parts of the book uncomfortable to read. It felt like a debut novel. I don't know if it is a debut or not but if it was not the author needs to obtain a better editor. The plot devices were very contrived and I was actually disappointed by the complete removal to the school. I was hoping more of an under-cover-student by day, London débutante by night plot. That would have been excellent. The book kind of vacillated between high school drama and bad spy movie never really deciding one way or the other. It was not a bad read, just not near as good as it probably could have been."
3,Okay book.....,"This book was an okay read. I probably won't read it again. From the book description, it looked like it would be a good, maybe funny book, but it was just lacking in a lot of areas, I thought."
5,Excellet book!,"I LOVED this book! I am not the type to read silly little romances, and this was anything but! I would highly recommend it to anyone, and I do mean ANYONE, since after I read this book I read a Newberry Award Winner, and then Camus' The Stranger. My only problem was the cover. I don't know about you, but I like to look at the cover so I can ""see"" in my mind what is happening in the book. But Kathryn looks like a puppet from Mr. Roger's Neighborhood!"
2,Another tedious (and silly) spy story,"While this book is not actually badly written, and is filled to the brim with those devices that bring us back to Regency romances time and time again, the authors are careful to never allow a speck of originality, logic, sense or history to mar the pages of their story. The writing is such that I will buy the next in the series (""Miss Grantham's One True Sin"" - due out as an ebook in September) but I would recommend giving this one a pass."
2,sorry not much here,"I am not a writer, author, publisher or anyone wishing to promote the sale of books. This one isn't worth the time or money"
3,Nice easy read,It was nice and easy to read. I expect to purchase and enjoy more books form this author.I kept the book on my kindel to read again.If you look for something to read on a bus or at the beach - this is it.
2,Are You Kidding?,"I want to address two things: first, we have this system complete with 20 room intercom units just like this one. It worked fine until about the 3-year mark. Then 12 out of our 20 units wouldn't work. Of course it's past the warranty stage, so out of luck there. Second, this is a bad price! You can definitely get these cheaper if you look around. $150 is an average price but you can even get it for $130 or so. At this price this unit deserves to be a paperweight! (mine are merely ugly room decorations that don't function...)"
5,Just perfect for what I needed!!!,This is my first staightner. It works just fine. Heats up quick!! Have no complaints!!!
2,broke right away,this straightener worked really good at first. i had really thick longggg hair and it straightened it pretty quickly. i had it for about two months and then it just stopped heating up. the handle would heat up and the little red light would go on but there was no heat on the ceramic at all. its really frustrating cuz i really liked it. i will not buy another revlon flat iron because this happened to my friend also.
3,no so hot,"It do not have this model hence the 3 stars, but recently purchased the Revlon flat iron that has a rounded edge for about the same price point. It could not straighten a baby's hair. My hair is wavy but not curly. The heat is so low and never fully come up to a temp that is useful. I was using an old Hot Tools model and did not want to spend big bucks on a ceramic salon iron but was very disappointed with my new purchase. Make sure your iron goes to 400 degrees f or you will not get a good product plus after research I found that plated ceramic irons can chip easily and reveal the metal plate underneath that snags your hair. In this case it really does pay to get a quality iron and you can get them a great prices on EBAY ( you don't have to spend more than $50). Don't waste your time on this."
5,ALL YOU NEED,"I read several reviews when looking for a flat iron and they terrified me. The only good reviews were for VERY expensive flat irons. Others warned of short life spans and melting handles. I bought this flat iron because it was afordable and I thought I would take my chances. Well, I love it! It has been all that I wanted and needed. It heats up very quickly, and the ceramic iron does not stick to your hair, even with heavy product use. It has an adjustable heat setting which has been the best feature for me. I have very fine hair so I don't need the iron to be very hot. I set it between 3 and 5 for perfectly straight hair. Other irons only have on/off, the heat from those would fry my hair.I have been very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it."
4,One of the best flat irons that I've ever used,"This iron works great on my coarse hair even on a low heat setting. Just don't be fooled by the newer version of this iron in which the word ""Ionic"" was added. The upc numbers are exactly the same. It's just a sales pitch to make the iron sound better. Heated ceramic material produces ions, so any iron out there with the word ""Ionic"" is no different than a plain ceramic iron."
5,Great product!!,This straightener works excellent! It heats up very quickly! (be careful!) Makes my hair stick straight in just a couple seconds. I would def recommend it for anyone with any sort of hair.
2,Works Well For A While,"I've had this flat iron for about 8 months. I only use it three or four times a week. It worked really well the first 6 months, but lately it doesn't seem to get as hot as it used to. Now it takes quite an effort to get my hair completely smooth (my hair is already stick straight, but gets lots of flyaways). My hairstylist uses the Chi and every time I go in to get my hair done I walk out with perfectly smooth hair - and it only takes him a couple of swipes with the Chi. The Revlon used to be that easy, but now I have to go over and over and over each section of hair in order to get decent results. I wouldn't recommend the Revlon for long-term use. It doesn't seem to hold up."
1,Not for use with CURLY hair!,"I read a ton of good review for this product so before I went to the salon and spent over $100 for a chi flat iron I decided to try it out. I bought a high end hair lotion to use with the iron and I was so excited to try it out. What I ended up with was not a head full of straight hair - I ended up with frizzy looking burnt smelling hair and a pretty badly burned thumb. I was generous enough to give this item one star because it does stay hot (see thumb), and I am sure someone with semi-straight or slightly wavy hair would be okay with it."
2,Silent,"Unless you are a die hard Laurel and Hardy fan, I would suggest you pass this item up. I expected to get Laurel and Hardy doing comedy together. Almost all the programs are silent and they are not the two in the typical comedy situations. You get tired of the piano music and trying to figure out where they are. So, I was not impressed with this product."
2,false advertising.,"Sons of the Desert (1933) is the crown jewel in any L&H; collection, and with Charley Chase as their stellar comedy costar, the boys reached the pinnacle of their unique partnership, playing a pair of Fez-wearing ""Sons of the Desert"" sneaking off to a convention in Chicago, but their wives discover the ruse with hilarious results. For L&H; fans, it simply doesn't get any better than this, although 1932's ""The Music Box"" shares equal status--and a 1932 Oscar for Best Comedy Short--in the L&H; pantheon. The remaining shorts on the disc (""Another Fine Mess,"" ""Busy Bodies,"" and ""County Hospital"") were produced during the prime of Stan & Ollie's sound-era success (1930-33), each boasting their own timeless bits and flawless routines. Abundant laughs are virtually guaranteed.The review is true,only thing is,these dvds don't contain sons of the desert,the music box,county hospital,or several others i especially ordered it for."
3,Just O'K,"Not as good as I was expecting, Laurel and Hardy are always great, but this disc has a lot of filler content."
3,content,viewing these dvds i found the quality was poor the pictures quality was not like most of the ones i have
1,Laurel & Haaardy 14 Episodes,Item contained the worst L & H later movies and a group of short silent films with either L or H alone with other actors. A great rip-off JP
2,This movie is nothing compared to them live!,What is wrong with Good Charlotte. I mean they should have never put out this DVD Joel's voice is quite obviously over worked and hoarse and I mean they just looked too hard. I have seen Good Charlotte live about 8 times now and this is in no way the quality of them live. This is a total rip off. I feel bad that I even bought this DVD I could have saved myself money and went and saw them live. Personally I would have been a lot more pleased. If you have to chose between this DVD and a live GC show...pick the show! Nothing can replace that! And if you can get backstage meeting them makes it even better.
1,GC Live,"I bought this dvd with my Christmas money last year because I was a HUGE Good Charlotte fan. I have to say that I am very disapointed with this dvd.One reason is because lead singer Joel Madden's vocals are rough and not plesent to the ear. He sounds like he has a sore throat. He also sounds like he's trying to be overly macho...which he's not. He's straining his instrument and it sounds terrible.Another reason is that they just don't sound good live. Billy Martin is the only one in the band that accually sounds GOOD. Benji and Joel are the only ones that anyone pays attention to on this dvd and that's a shame because the other more talented band members deserve attention too.I wouldn't recomend this dvd unless you are a HUGE fan of the band and collect thier merchandise. But if you only like a few songs or if you don't collect thier merch, then this is not the dvd for you. I think I wasted $16.00 on this hunk of crap dvd."
1,What?,"Thought Good Charlotte sucked and only people with no musical taste would pay money to listen to them. Well then there's Charlotte live....my god do they even play their own instruments.....doubtful. Sould be called Good Charlotte ""LIVE?"""
1,Did it do anything ?,I didn't know what to expect from this cleaner. It didn't seem to do anything. No directions came with it and there was no difference in performance after using it.
5,8 DVD set by the Wonder kids! A+++,"These are 8 hours total and are annimated with famous Christian stars narriating them such as Max Lucado, Rebecca St. James plus more! My kids love them! (ages 2, 7)Great buy!!"
5,My one year old loves it,"This toy is so cute and sturdy. He bangs it around all the time and it has taken a beating. Yet, it is still intact and the little people and animals are just perfect for chunky hands!"
4,a great way to inspire little ones,My Little girls loves this toy. She got this from the Hospital when she was admitted back in January. She loves to push this toy around and then dock the boat and play with the animals. She likes all of her little people's collection and this was just another great addition. What a great concept fisher price has with the little people's. Thanks fisher price for all the great products that allow children to explore their imagination.
5,wonderful toy!!!,"My daughter recieved this toy when she was about 1 1/2 years old. She is now 3 1/2 and still plays with Noah's Ark. We bought a lot of the Little People toys, and this was her favorite. In fact, we have handed down most of her LP playsets to younger cousins, but she threw a fit to keep the ark. The extra animal sets are also really great and worth the money!"
5,"Noah, Sarah and the two by twos!","I love this toy. I had requested it for my son's 1st birthday and he got two of them for his second (still 1 year old) Christmas. He continues to play with it and I had to get the two additional animal sets. It's really his favorite fisher price toy to play with. And I could add a few different renditions of the story of Noah to really use it as a teaching tool. He is almost 3 now and both he and his cousin love to play with the animals. I highly recommend this toy for so many reasons! It's well made, the animals are adorable and it's easy to see how children could imagine with this one.I also suggest for Christmas to get one of the Little People Christmas (creche) sets. It's another learning tool and a ""decoration"" that can be played with instead of the ornaments!-"
4,It's just part of a set,"When our baby turned one, we started buying her the Little People sets that are good for age 12M. At her first birthday party, we received a lot of Little People items, but most were for 18M and up. So we put them all away and only let her play with the things that are good for 12M which includes the Ark, which she likes to play with. She pretty much only picks up the animals and puts them in her mouth. She will walk around with them all day in her hands. I think when she gets a little older, she will love playing with this toy. It is a timeless classic."
5,My son loves this toy!,"My son got this toy when he was 9 months old. It's great! He walked around with the little flag for days- I don't know what the attraction was, but he just loved it. My son quickly learned what the different animals are and he makes their sounds. He also liked to just sit and spin the wheels that are on the bottom of the ark, push the ark around the floor and open and close the door. We've played with this toy almost daily for months. Now he's just over a year and still plays with it often. A great thing about this toy is that most of the other Little People animals can go well with it. Great for any little animal lover!"
5,Fisher Price Noah's Ark,"This Ark with the two extra sets of baby animals is a Christmas gift for our first grandchild. They are soft, washable, the perfect size for little hands...not to mention adorable!"
3,Cute product,"I purchased this product for my 1 yr. old grand daughter based on others' reviews. It's an enjoyable toy, but I spent $58.00 plus shipping and I was shocked to see how little I got for my money. I would suggest that you check out other websites to see if you can get it cheaper....much cheaper. I have found that Amazon is not a good place to shop for toys. Google and you will likely find the same product for less. Otherwise, a good toy."
3,Cheaply made,"This held my daughter's interest for a total of about 10 minutes. None of the animals stand up very well inside the ark, and you would think that this would actually come with a decent variety of animals, but there were just a few. The plastic is thin, and it just doesn't look like much quality work went into it."
3,Hard for younger ones...,... to figure out how to open and close the Ark... there are lots of separatep ieces.
3,not so great!,Our childred enjoy the animals more than the arc. The arc ends up being nothing but a storage container.
5,Great Toy,Great for pretend play and can even help teach beginning math concepts (2 by 2) if used properly. Cleans up nice due to storage component.
4,"Great toy, but where are the ELEPHANTS?","My toddler twins have been enjoying this for a long time, though we did have to store it for a while during the ""projectile"" phase. One of them enjoys lining up the animals and Mr. & Mrs. Noah along the table. But really now, what's a Noah's ark without elephants. We bought all the additional packets and found no elephants among them. Hear that Fisher-Price! Give us elephants. The set is colorful and durable and I do recommend it. It will be a while before my kids understand the story of Noah's Ark, but then they'll be able to act it out. Great fun."
5,Wonderful toy!!,"Our one year old son loves this toy. The animals are wonderful and the set closes up to one unit for easy storage. Neat features such as the hatch to put the animals into the ark and the ramp so that the animals can leave the ark help keep it very interesting for him. I know as he grows, the possibilities for his imagination to blossom using the ark, which has wheels to push it with, and the animals for play will be endless. The flag for the top of the ark is also very clever with a rainbow on one side and rain/lightning on the other. One problem is that if you are looking for the additional animals sets, they are very hard to come by at this point!"
4,Great for all ages,"This is a great toy. My daughter got this toy for her 1st birthday and now she's 4 and still plays with it. When all of the other toys get thrown out this one seems to stick around. My daughter loved this so much that I bought the pirate ship for my son. The only thing that I don't like is the arc will come apart. It will snap right back together, but only one side is suppose to open and instead it will come apart completely. That can be a little frustrating to a child, but not a huge deal."
4,This is really cute,"I bought this for my grandson Levi's 1st birthday. It is so cute. A rather large toy to with lots of animals and Noah. He loves to carry the animals around with him but doesn't play with the ark to much. But, he does play with those animals all the time. All the little people toys are really cute and pretty durable, you can't make a bad purchase with little people and I've bought several different sets."
5,Gift from Across the Miles,"This gift was for my Nephew's 1st birthday. Having no kids of my own and living about 5 states away, I had NO IDEA what to get him. I remembered playing with Fisher Price when I was a kid and thought this was very cute ( I love animals!). I read some of the other reviews about this product and found them to be very positive and decided on this for his gift. I'm so glad I did! My sister said ""He LOVES it!"". He takes the animals with him on car trips and loves to take apart and put back together the ark. I would recommend this product to anyone with small kids, and perhaps anyone not sure of what to get small kids as gifts."
4,A book with lots of great help for any man.,"This book has 3 sections to it. The 1st section has great examples of ""bad fathering"", the 2nd section has excellent examples of ""good fathering"". The 3rd section nicely ties up what we can learn from all this, and also includes a nice section on men as mentors. Personally, I got much more out of the 2nd and 3rd sections than the first. I found that there was a lot I learned from ""outstanding fathers"". The book holds steady, but starts a little too slow to give it 5 stars. It definitely deserves at least 4 stars."
3,Don't bother with this one brother!,"The first 9 chapters of this book are a waste of time. The author uses these chapters as a ""cookie cutter"" to describe bad fathering styles and good fathering styles and it is doubtful that anyones father would match the descriptions provided.There are only 2-3 chapters remaining that have any meaningful information. Save your money and have dinner with a good friend"
5,Incredible life-changing book for all of us,This will provide both men and women with the incredible insight to heal from past hurts. Jarema takes a solid experiential approach backed up with real life examples from his practice that will move you to discovering what is necessary to be empowered beyod your imagination.I highly recommend this book.
2,"Same book, different title","Tony Bouza was my commander before I retired from the NYPD on disability. A very bright and thoughtful individual, but each of his three books that I have read are retreads of one another. He wrote a book about intelligence operations that I want to read some day as I was a member of the NYPD Bureau of Special Services after Chief Bouza had served there.Buy and read one, the others are the same.Phil Zimmermann, JD"
3,Not convinced...,"...that the life of this battery is any longer than that of the battery that came with the Razr.My husband purchased this battery but it was too bulky to fit in his holster, so he passed it along to me. The battery life continues to be unimpressive."
4,Razr extended life battery,"All in all the battery is what you pay for. For me it worked great. didnt have to charge my battery for 3 days sometimes depending on how i used it. The only downfall in my opinion is the cover for it. It's very cheap, plastic of course, and the paint on it was rubbing off the first day i got it. but im not complaining cause it was only [...] bucks! and what a bargain for a good battery and a decent cover."
1,Junk does not last,This is a cheap battery it lasted less time then my smaller battery but was much bigger. Just buy a normal battery not this junk and you will not need to have an extended battery cover or make the phone any bigger. I have had other extended batteries that work better and they are worth it but this one is not.
3,good at first... average in the end,"This battery lasted forever when I first got it. Now that I have had it for about a month it lasts for about a day with average usage. That is still better than how long the original battery lasted though. It's OK. Didn't match the reviews that said it was ""all that and a bag of chips."""
1,Motorola Razr V3c replacement battery,very disappointed with this product. Motorola Razr V3c V3m Lithium-ion Silver Extended Replacement Battery 3.7v with Extended Battery Case Cover (Not Compatible GSM Cingular and T-mobile)did not work with the Motorola V3c phone.i now have lost my shipping money which i will be calling to get a refund on.now i'm not sure if i can trust Amazon for another purchase. you have lost my business
3,Extented battery may not be up to spec.,"I bought this battery to replace my regular battery on my Motorola RAZR V3m. I didn't notice any improved battery time since I still see only three bars left on the battery meter after two days, which is very close to my old battery. I almost alway recharge the battery every two days, so I haven't run down the battery yet. Maybe it will last longer even if the battery meter run into the last bar?"

2,Not for DS,"My sister and I have watched every possible movie/show, and read every piece on this show.We have all the games. However, they just aren't as fun/easy to play on the DS. Much better on other systems."
1,Not Legit,"As a Breitling watch owner, I can tell you they are the highest quality hand crafted timepiece in the world. Unfortunately, authentic, new Breitling watches CANNOT be purchased online. Before buying this watch, visit Breitling's website and find an AUTHORIZED Breitling dealer in your area to get the true Breitling ownership experience. They also provide a warning on their website stating that new Breitling watches can't be purchased online. Any watch purchased here will not truly be new and in some cases may have the serial number that identifies it to Breitling buffed off."
2,Flawless Interior Decorating,"I was very disappointed in this book. It basically divides interior decorating into styles such as traditional, contemporary, cottage etc and tells you the colors that are predominantly used in that style and the fabrics.It does not give any advice on HOW to do anything. I would not buy this book again---save your money"
5,Sexy & Stylish,"(michael's wife). I bought a pair of these in white (see through so wear appr. undergarments) and black because they are so comfortable and flattering to the figure. The twist tie front with wide band is great at disguising a little extra in the midsection, and the flowing material around the legs adds length. Wear with high heeled shoes or the bottoms will be dragging on the ground though."
1,young pony express rider,"""Young Pony Express Rider"" is a good read with plenty of excitement and history of the first pony express riders. It is full of adventure with young men delivering the mail in the west. I found it exciting, entertaining and well worth the time to read. I highly reccommend it to any young reader that would enjoy a good western tale and adventure."
1,Product has a design defect; save your money,"January 11, 2011: After trying two of these, I found (as others have noted) that the timer mechanism on this device is defective, rendering the product unreliable. Though the device may deter barking when it is powered on, the timer mechanism is so unpredictable that you will never know whether it is ""on"" unless you stand in your yard all day and stare at it [though seeing the power light in daylight is nearly impossible]. You simply cannot expect it to be on at the proper time.The manufacturer has confirmed to me that the product is flawed and cannot give an estimate as to when a reliable replacement will be available. I recommend to Amazon buyers that you steer clear of this device until you see some positive reviews posted AFTER this date. And to Amazon, I say: take this product out of your inventory!"
1,does nothing in front of the dog's face,"I bought this product to quiet our neighbor's dogs who bark viciously any time we go into our own backyard. I tried it out on my mom's border collie in the audible mode. I held the thing RIGHT in front of my mom's wildly barking dog and it made no sounds whatsoever- this is in the audible mode where it should emit a sound that humans can hear. I tried it in the other mode in front of the barking dog as well, but there was no effect on her wild barking. I decided that if this does nothing right in front of a barking dog's face, then it is unlikely to work from 50 feet away. I am disappointed and obviously returned the product."
1,Not Worth the Money Didn't Work,The dog barking hasn't stopped even though the device works.Don't waste your time with this unless you feel lucky that the dog will respond to this device.The dog was barking right in front of this and no impact to make him stop.Not worth the money. Try something else.Lentek Super Bark Free PRO Series
5,No bark,I have to agree. Take the time to adjust settings and give the product a week or two to truly make a decision on weather it works. On my dachshund it worked that day. On our friends Shellie it took setting changes and a week but worked in the end. I recommend this product
2,Worked for a little while,"This bark control unit worked for weeks, but then the dogs got used to it. I'm not sure about the exact working range for us. I'm not sure how well it picks up barking at the furthest range. We use it plugged into an outlet and mounted on the wall within a backyard screened-in porch."
2,"Worked at first, but then dogs got used to it","Worked at first, but then dogs got used to it. They just ignore it now. I'd like to return it."
4,peace...finally!,"I was skeptical but desperate when I purchased this item. However, after the first day there was an obvious reduction in the frequency and pitch of the barking from the three obnoxious yippy dogs next door. I even slept in the guest room which is closest to them to see if it lasted throughout the night; it works!FABULOUS!"
4,Bark Free,"This is the 3rd Bark Free that I have owned. The first 2 succumbed to moisture, but this one is supposedly rain resistant. The unit works great on nuisance barking of dogs, although I recommend using the wall wart instead of batteries. The unit eats ""D"" cells. The setup instructions do not tell you that the timer has to go through a whole cycle before it will turn on??? and the online tech help isn't much help. Amazon promised a free upgrade to 2-day shipping, but it still took 6 days."
1,"TERRIBLE product- even worse ""Customer Service""","I guess I hoped for too much when I saw this product. As an owner of three dogs in a neighborhood full of dogs, I was hoping that this would cut down on the noise. Unfortunately, it NEVER worked properly. The only mode that worked was the ""audible"" mode, and that is damaging to everyone's ears. I had to contact Amazon to assist with the return, as the seller would not even work with me, as the 30-day window had elapsed. Although I had contacted the seller in a timely manner via email, the seller would not even take that into account, because I did not follow up with an immediate phone call. I am VERY unhappy with this product, and even more unhappy with their ""customer service""."
4,It Works!,It stopped un-needed barking right away... If you want your dogs to stop barking all the time I recommend this product. On top of that they will still bark at things they should bark are to allert you to danger or people at the door etc. It worked on both of my little poodles... There Is one problem with it I have discovered though... It keeps turning itself off and is hard to program...
3,Weak Product,"Although I don't doubt that the product works to quiet dogs, the design is extremely feeble and it is difficult to use. I agree with other users on the fact that an ON/OFF switch added to the timer would be a much smarter approach to using the product. Although it is possible to find tricks to turn on the product (for example, setting the timer ON a couple of minutes after the current real time) it would be much easier to simply have a switch. As far as the barking goes, the dogs next door are indeed quieter since I started using the product. However, they still bark a little bit. I think a newer generation of this device, with a better, stronger design; an ON/OFF switch; a real weather-proof digital display (I have used the product for less than three weeks and the display is already a bit fuzzy!); as well as better ultrasonic speakers (to really quiet dogs down!) would greatly improve what today I see as a SOMEWHAT MEDIOCRE PRODUCT."
2,arf,This device is very hard to set up. I still am having difficulty figuring it out and I have four barking dogs that I want to train!! :{
2,The digital numbers are not seen anymore...,I purchased this item one year ago to use outdoors. I live overseas and the climate is mild over here.I can not set the time anymore because it is not possible to read the digital numbers.They are swiped off due to outdoor conditions.I wrote to the company.They said it is weather proof not water proof.Here is the info about this device in the sky mall.All three units are water resistant.So you decide....
3,not waterproof but seems to work at times,"I have an aggressive set of dogs on the other side of my iron fence, otherwise known as Holly and the Dog of Death. Even though I know they are coming, they have a primal bark that will blow you away. Nothing seemed to work...ignoring, scolding....Fed up I decided to try the bark free pro. Took a while to get it set to come on when they barked, but they did react to it, and it appeared to be working. Then it stopped working. Turns out it was full of water...so much for waterproof. Unit was toast after a couple months. I am desperate enough to get another. Maybe I will wrap in in a plastic bag this time. Good enough to try again."
3,Only Worked at First,This seemed to do the trick for about a week and then the dogs just ignored it and kept barking. You might give it a try but it was a complete waste of money as far as we are concerned.
5,My Favorite...and my son's,"Bought the CD. Bought the DVD. It's on in the car and at home on TV (respectively). My son is entertained...now if only I didn't have to listen to it 5 times a day, I'd actually say this is my favorite out of all the Greg/Sam Wiggles....now we just have to see them perform this live to complete the delivery of this title."
4,New Wiggly fun,"Pop Goes the Wiggle Nursery RhymesThe first new Dvd in some time form the Wiggles, the first song filled show with Sam Moran as Sam the Yellow Wiggle. Getting Strong in our opinion was more a skit filled then song filled (still good!). It's nice to see them rolling out the Dvd's again after a bit of a Wiggly lull. This new Dvd, is a bunch of Nursery Rhymes from all over the world. My son is 3 and still loves the Wiggles, we have all the Dvd and go to the shows when the are in the area. I would recommend the Dvd if your kiddos enjoy the Fab 4 of Australia. It is all songs/rhymes and not many skits. I have already recommended this one to friends after just one viewing."
3,Just Redundant if You're Watching the TV Shows Too,"A few months back, I would have given this five stars. My daughter loves it, and I really liked that it taught her some common (and some not so common) nursery rhymes that she might run into down the road. NOW, however, I'm a little miffed. The new television shows that just started airing a couple months back integrate all of the exact skits/songs from this video. As a result, the tv shows now bore the heck out of my daughter, who has watched the video a million times, and now misses the old dancing based skits she used to have fun with (Hot Potato, Do the Monkey, etc.) Perhaps I'm more let down by the changes in the television show than by this video on its own, but still, don't buy it if you're looking for something different from what's currently on television, or if you're wanting songs your toddler can learn the moves to."
4,Wiggles,My 2 year old and 5 month old love this DVD. We put it in the DVD player in the car for long trips and they clap and my wife and I sing along.
2,Weird,I usually love the wiggles but this one was weird. However my 2 year old was not bothered by the strange costumes and creepy jack in the box.
3,My favorite author disappoints me for the first time,"I am a huge Marion Chesney/MC Beaton/Jennie Tremaine, etc. fan. I own every single book she ever wrote, I believe, even some pretty obscure ones. I was so excited to see she was writing something new and got Snobbery with Violence immediately. You can imagine my surprise when I found that this new mystery is a total snore. The characters are bland and don't hold my interest at all, and this book lacks any of the laugh out loud moments of Marion Chesney's earler works. I'm going to try and hide my disappointment and go re-read the School for Manners. Hopefully the next book will be better."
3,A light bit of stuff.,"Although I found the plot a bit slow and meandering at times, the picture it provided of the social structure and mores of the Edwardian period was fascinating. The book is classic M.C. Beaton in that the diversity of characters is the strength of the story, rather than the plot. In all, this is a light bit of stuff."
2,Kindle Version is full of mistakes!!,"I purchased this book the other day and while the story isn't bad (it's not great, but not bad), the Kindle formatting is terrible. There are misspelled words all over the place, hyphens and blank spaces in the middle of sentences, no spaces between character dialog and almost anything with an apostrophe is almost unreadable. I'll becomes Ull, You'll become /oUl or yoUl, and so on. It's ridiculous. For $7 for an electronic download, they could have at least proof read and formatted it correctly. If this were a paper book, I would have returned it because of all the errors. This is the first Kindle book I've had this problem with but there are enough errors in this one book to make up for all the other books that don't have errors. Bad form, Amazon, bad form. If I were the author I'd be furious.If you want to read this, buy it in print unless you want to spend a good portion of your time trying to figure out what 1/3 of the words are."
2,Disappointing Kindle version,"I enjoyed reading the story. I did not enjoy reading the Kindle edition. My dear! fraught with errors! Don't they proof read these electronic conversions? For example, and these are scattered throughout the story, I'll becomes Ul or Hl; ifou means If you. In addition there are blank spaces within words and hyphens all over the place, whether appropriate or not. If you want to read the story, be prepared to take some time to translate. Surely, they can do better than this."
3,Light reading with charming characters,"Lady Rose Summer and her companion Daisy do remind me of the characters in the TV series ""Two Broke Girls"", the naive upper class lady and the street wise associate. This is a way to get a dose of likable characters and learn a little about the difficulties of Edwardian life."
3,"Slow start, but shows promise","Having never read anything from this author before, I didn't really have many expectations about the quality of her work. The story felt rushed at the very beginning, and contained several scenes that seemed only to exist to give background on the characters. While there's nothing inherently wrong with this, the scenes do nothing at all to move the plot forward.Speaking of plot, the book is subtitled ""An Edwardian Mystery,"" but the mystery doesn't make its debut until about a third of the way in, and the book was two thirds done before anything became truly compelling.Despite having what I feel to be a rather thin plot, shallowly conceived characters and a setting that is not immersive and only superficially Edwardian, I would not say it is a complete miss. For all its flaws, I did find myself engrossed by that last third, and it is enough to give me hope that my major gripes are just part of setting the stage for the series, and I will give the next one a shot."
4,M.C. enchants us with new characters to befriend,"I had a great time just getting familiar with the new characters in this new series. The story was a bit silly, but had some very charming moments. Every time I finish one of Beaton's books, I fear she will not write another soon enough. Look forward to Harry and Rose's next adventure."
3,.,"Duza wrote the story on note cards, half great material and half bad material. He them threw them all up into the air and published them as they lay.The parts that are good are really good but the parts that are bad are just boring. The style is schizo and so you never know what style the next page will be. This is both good and bad."
3,DBA = Daring Bizarro Adventure,"As I read this I wondered how of my friends would want to be associated with me if they knew I had read this book (and pretty much liked it). I answered myself ""probably none"". And now I'm going to make it public.Unique. Gory. Funny. Sick. Exciting. Sickening. Intelligent concept. Vile. Inventive. Weird. Weirder.You don't need to know more than the Amazon description tells you for you to learn what the book is about. If you have not been exposed to Bizarro fiction before, you should begin with one of the Bizarro Starter Kits. If you survive that, then consider this one.Duza's writing skills need sharpened, but the story made up for some of it. The illustrations by Mellick captured the descriptions and added to the pleasure.Though this book was better edited than some I have read in this genre, there were too many blips left. Please at least re-read before publishing. The lack of respect for the reader is annoying. Thank you."
2,better movie than a book,"this would make a grat movie... or maybe even better... a re write ofthe original story. everything about this book screams GREAT READ! but as other reviews have pointed out its a bit hard to follow. but if you can get past that, there are some very good scenes and the authors descriptions are almost to real at times (in a good way). my advice is sadly to skip this book but buy the second book 'Jesus Freaks' bythe same author. which is much better and a real kick in the pants both intelecutally as well as action wise. so ill sit and wait 'till the next installment in Mr. Duza's library..."
3,Art Nouveau tile C. 1890-1914,I was disappointed with the quality of this book. All the photos are either digital or downloaded from the web. There is a great variety of beautiful tiles but the images themselves are really grainy.
3,"Useful for the layperson, but don't rely on it.","First, let us say what this is not. This is not a lexicon. It is a theological dictionary. Which means he's interpreting terms for you. Those interpretations can be good, they can be bad, they can be speculative. You get all of the above in this work.Lexicons do this to some extent as well, but not as much as theological dictionaries do. This work can be useful if you're not experienced with the original languages. But if you want the best tools, learn the Greek alphabet and get yourself a lexicon. If you want something handy in one easy-to-use volume. This will work. But don't trust it exclusively, and don't neglect your own studies for his interpretations."
1,Save your money,"This book really is a waste of money. It's not worth the paper it's written on. I wish I could sell it. I'll never use it. I was totally surprised. I have the Old and New Testament Word Studies by Zodhiates and I do recommend those, but not this."
2,N.T. Word study,"not at all what I expected or was looking for, but that is not Amazon's fault. I should have known what I was ordering."
1,Not what I expected at all,I wanted the word study dictionary itself not pages of scriptural reference numbers. This is a companion to the dictionary not the dictionary itself. I wish it was made clear in the description. I needed this dictionary for school. Now I'll have to wait another few weeks for the correct word study dictionary to arrive.
3,Dont make the same mistake I did...,"im rating it 3 stars because it is what it says it is... an index. I will probably not use this though. I thought this was the dictionary itself, that was my mistake. This is an index meant to accompany the dictionary and the dictionary is meant to accompany the Word Study New Testament. All the books in this series have very similar titles and the same author, so look carefully before you buy.That said, this is an excellent series to have if you want to find a better understanding of the original Greek New Testament."
2,Not what we expected,"This is basically a dictionary where you look up a Hebrew or Greek word to find the English meaning. Works great if you read the Bible in Hebrew or Greek, but didn't help us at all with our KJV Bible. We were hoping for a reference that took English scripture and examined it using the original language so we could better understand the context and choices the translator made in creating the English version. This isn't it. For us English-only people, this was not useful."
3,OK movie.,I got this to see more of the country and films of Finland- where my husband is from. He doesn't really care for the movie. I thought it was OK. It's a bit drawn out and slow until the end. Nice scenery though. You really get a sense of how people used to live in remote areas there.
4,Enjoyment...,My special-needs son is a movie buff. Have gotten him one of these books every year since 2005. He gets lost in them for hours. It's amazing the amount of info he has mentally stored from this book.
1,Good idea poorly executed,"I bought this no-crank hose reel at Home Depot because I liked it's many features. After trying to hook it up properly, I'm going to return it immediately. This is a good idea very poorly executed. The hose connection is made of plastic and is positioned in such a way that it is very difficult to connect the hose to the reel. Worse yet, the connection for the hose is plastic and easily stripped! Those two factors combined make for a leaky mess. After I return this one, I hope to find a similar style hose reel with proper metal connections and will look much more closely for well positioned connectors. I would definitely not recommend this product, especially at the price!"
5,Knowing Her Place Teaches Me To Look For Mine,"Lorri Neilsen's journey through academia raises profound questions about education and the production of knowledge: who's knowledge is considered valid? After exercising great discipline and excellence in her studies, she comes to recognize ""the language of theory"" as a form of ""conceptual imperialism,"" which allows little space for lived experience.In her book, Neilsen draws surprising insights from a variety of processes and states of being, be it adaptation, writing, teaching, reflecting, or authenticity. Her poetic writing resonate long beyond the moment. More important perhaps, she provides writers, students, and teachers with encouragement to explore the unbeaten path, to dare to be curious and bold.Meaningful learning and research embraces integrity, passion, and compassion. Neilsen suggests not sterile objectivity, but engagement that demands and offers respect. An enriching and very pleasant read."
5,Keep this book within reach,"This is the kind of book that you want to keep nearby...when your perspective goes off a little and you're getting a little crazy, pretty much any one of the chapters will help get you back to basics. I really, really like this book. Thanks, Meghan."
5,Only expensive if it is NOT Tiffany.,"this is a great lamp, first i bought it i didn't realized it's Tiffany lamp, i just think it's expensive, but after it's arrival, it's SAFLY packaged, and you really can feel what you get is what was you were paying for! then recently, i just realized that it's Tiffany, i'm really happy!"
5,Very happy,The product was shipped and arrived very quickly. I was very happy with the product. The product was just as pictured. I would definately recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing this product.
2,Tiffany STYLE lamp,"Very upset this was a tiffany STYLE lamp, it listed it as a Tiffany lamp but its really a LEAD based paint tiffany STYLE, NOT worth the price, unfortunate it could have been a nice lamp ...returning ASAP do not want anything with lead in my home around my children!"
4,Much more than programming Gaim,"I always wanted to get involved with Open Source programming, but never knew just how. This book is a good introduction to the world of open source, with Gaim as the example. From learning CVS to setting up a build environment to compiling code to programming patches and plugins for Gaim, this book has a good overview of all of the above. I highly reccomend to anyone interested in developing open source applications."
3,Disappointed,"I expected this book to be a nice story about Egan's adventures as he worked on Gaim. Well... it is a story about that... with every single detail about how to write a Gaim program, from writing your first ""Hello World"" in C to writing your first ""Hello World"" Gaim extension to Gaim. This book assumes you know NOTHING about ANYTHING.If you already know how to write C and C++, and you know what a socket is, then this book is nothing more than a bad intro to GTK+."
4,This is THE book on the subject,"Seriously, the title says it all. It is a gem of another era, and an amazing piece of both maritime history and Americana."
3,"Attractive, sturdy but lack quality control","I purchased four pairs of these shelf brackets to complement the stainless-steel appliances in my kitchen. The brackets' finish is very attractive, as is the overall design. But, be prepared for some quirks. Two of the pairs were roughly wrought, and the two sides of each bracket were not square. The other two pairs were of better quality control, so I'd be on the fence if I were to purchase them again. In all, however, they look great in our kitchen if you can overlook the lack of straight lines."
2,"Disappointing casting, choreography and performance","I am comparing this to the standard format DVD edition staged by La Scala with Angel Corella. POB is my favorite company and yet they have botched this one. The production is miscast. Manuel Legris is terrible. The characters are insipid, and everythere is there, lack of passion. There is not even the finish and precision that is characteristic of POB. Watch the La Scala production and see the difference. This is not even a good alternate production to have, it is a waste of time and money."
5,Insightful DVD,"This is an incredible DVD.One thing that deserves comment is how well the digital restoration was done. From what I understand, this digital restoration set the industry standard.Secondly, you get to hear about Scientology from the source of Scientology himself - L. Ron Hubbard. This lets you make up your own mind. In an hour's time you're left with a firm idea of what Scientology is and also some knowledge that you can use in your own life."
5,AN INTRODUCTION TO SCIENTOLOGY: FILMED INTERVIEW WITH L. RON HUBBARD,"It was very informative & I enjoyed it! I have heard that it was colorized, and if so, remarkably so!"
5,Great for good work.,"I used these for stocking stuffers, but, I also use them for good grades. One card for every A on a test. I now will take one away for every B, two for every C, and so on. I think the grades will stay honor roll."
2,too high,This a not a good toy for a yugioh collecter because you want different cards from different sets not just from the same set pharaoh servent is a good set but you cant get all the cards you want in this booster box you should just buy booster packs of every single set or buy the metal raiders pack the 20 booster pack and get some booster from magic ruler blue eyes white dragon metel raider and pharoah servent so dont get this box the card game is great but when you get the same booster packs with the same cards if I were you i would actually get a tin the best tin is the red eyes black dragon so dont get this booster box it is A waste of money
5,a good pack with good cards,"this is a realy good pack, my faviorte is thousand-eyes resrict in which i have and also, you could get JINZO!,so how about you get it!!"
5,great fun but a bit too much,if you collect these cards like i do you will need to buy more cards to enhance your deck but they are a bit too dear for only nine cards in a pack and i cant see many people paying one hundred and twenty pounds for 36 packs although it would help you increase your deck a hell of a lot but if you think about it how many of the same cards would you have so realy you have paid all that money to only have about 60 cards that you wont have about four of plus only about 4-5 of the cards will be shinys so is it worth all that money for that big box of cards
5,Yu-gi-oh,"This is a very entertaining gift to play with your child. It reminds me a lot of war, with a deck of cards, it's just more advanced."
4,Excellent swiss watch,"The only issue with this product is that it did not include an instruction manual in the product box, which needs to be downloaded from Tissot's web page (after a bit of research to locate the adequate one....)"
5,Maybe his best album,"Torme at the top of his powers. Good mix of older and newer songs. ""The Real Thing"" which Torme wrote with Gerry Mulligan deserves to be a standard. The Porgy and Bess medley is a tour de force. And Torme offers the definitive version of ""Isn't It a Pity.""His passing was a tragic loss to music."
1,There is no master tape for this Mel album!,"The reviews of the CD of this Mel Torme album are very interesting in that no one realizes that there IS NO MASTER TAPE for this title. It's missing. Who knows what was used to produce the CD? Perhaps even a record. Actually NO CD beats a clean original LP properly played back and that's especially true of this Mel Torme album since the LP was cut from the master and the CD was produced from who knows what and apparently it's missing some of the album.Vinyl copies can be found, even 1A first pressings, for not that much money. Clean properly, play back properly and you're in the night club with Mel, Jonathan Janis and the others. On the CD? A glazed facsimile."
2,Software may mess up your computer,"I installed this device and it's accompanying cd software according to the included instructions, and it totally messed up my computer (running Windows XP). The software seems to be severely flawed because it first eats up all of my CPU usage (suddenly in task manager it says ""System"" is using 99%), then it messed up my Windows XP SP2 firewall, and then it disabled my Norton Antivirus. If this software wasn't from Netgear I would have thought it was a computer virus! Oh, and the wireless usb adapter doesn't work, of course. I had to switch back to my wired networking.The only reason I am giving it two stars instead of one is because it seems to work fine with another computer in my house. Go figure. Netgear's support and website aren't useful either."
1,Boring and Silly,"After seeing David Rothman on the Daily Show I was eagerly awaiting the publication of this book. I had mixed feelings upon its release: while its ignorance and paternalism made me repeatedly laugh out loud, it made me quite depressed to think that these people are the leading scholars in this field and that devoted so much of their lives to the writing of such drivel.As other reviewers below have noted, the Rothmans know no science. Will someone please explain to them that a hormonal disorder (endocrine) can be genetic?!?Moreover, the patronizing tone is just too much. But you knew that if you've ever met them or read anything else they've written (see New York Review of Books articles on organ sales for examples, which is also extraordinarily racist).Don't waste your time and certainly don't give anyone else this book, for the holidays or otherwise.I only wish Amazon would let me give it zero stars."
1,Irrelevant to the World Today,"Bought this hoping it would give me some understanding of all the scandals with doping. Waste of time and money.The Tour De France scandals of years back, the TGH steriods cases, Bobby Bonds, Sammy Sosa, east german swimmers, trck and field, etc. These are guys truly pursuing perfection. That was going after Roger Maris is all about.Not a word. Just a dry academic tome on history of endinocrinology. Blah blah blah.Anyone want to buy a used copy?"
1,disappointing,"I bought this book to understand the issues surrounding estrogewn use in women. THe reviews on this website seemed encouraging....The information provided was outdated, inaccuarte and useless"
1,Far from topical,"The New York Times Sunday magazine had a long cover piece about the pursuit of perfection among elite athletes today. Did they quote from this book once? NO. Did they interview the authors? NO. Why? Because this book has nothing relevant to say about any of the controversies going on in the world to regarding enhancement.This is a history lesson. Another boring lecture by boring people with nothing to help guide us through the morass of today and tomorrow's very real dilemmas.If you are looking for a guide to understanding the enhancement mess we are in today, look elsewhere. Policy wanks, politicans, doctors in the field, women facing the choice of whether or not to take estrogen, my advice to you is not to buy this book.But if you are for a very (!) a dry recitation of history and the history of endocrinology at that, then I guess this is your book."
5,Genetics for the holidays,"This is a book that is going to solve my gift-giving next month. Although there are many chapters of interest, the one that struck me as altogether original and fascinating was a discussion of what was coming down the pike at us in terms of genetics. The section on anti-aging through a better understanding of the genetics of the cell is worth the price of the book-- they are right that new interventions will not come full-blown and safe. Each of us will have to ponder what we are willing to risk in return for possible, but only possible, benefits. If you have friends who are ready to try anything and everything to look young, do them a favor and send this to them."
5,Fast and reliable service.,When I got my order it was professionally packed.I am pleased with fast and reliable service.Thanks
5,Probably the best Korean Melodrama to date,"A ridiculously tearful melodrama. Despite the medium grade writing and direction, picking nits with this film is useless. It is so well-acted by two beautiful Koreans it's freakish. First half is smiley RomCom, second half is face dripping, and I mean soaking wet, sad. Have tissue ready."
3,A great movie,"This was already one of my favorite films at the time that I purchased it, but there are two problems with this particular DVD: the subtitles are sometimes out of sync, and they are not accessible via the main menu. It is necessary to have a remote control with subtitle capabilities."
5,A wonderful love story!!!,"This has to be one of the most wonderful, charming, and the saddest love story that I have ever seen. A man finally found the love of his life, but lost her to Alzheimer's disease. She couldn't remember who she is and all the wonderful memories that she had with the man that she love, still he loves her and stay by her side. It's such a heartfelt love story and teaches you what true love is all about. I gave this movie 5 stars because any time a movie can make me cry and feel for the character it is a movie that is well done, not to mention the acting (especially the lead actor Jung Woo Sung) is excellent. I wished I could buy this movie for everybody to see, it is that good and it will bring tears to you eyes too!!!"
1,tore apart on the first day,"There were small holes on the sleeves upon delivery. They wouldn't be terrible if it didn't tear even more in one day and the wing fell apart and could not be put back together.The cloth is very cheap and stiching is done horribly. The company offered me a small discount for me to remove my comment. Didn't accept it, so no one else would spend this amount on a piece of junk."
3,"It's History, Kids!","Reading the posted reviews here, I noticed that some readers thought the booksimply a good read, others questioned the characterizations as hunk fantasies,women-hating cartoons, stereotypes, and so on, and still others looked uponMerrick as an instrument of one's coming out--a gay primer, one might say.But it's something else as well, because back when it came out, the Stonewallcoterie of White, Picano, Holleran, Whitmore, and others had not yet appeared.The Lord Won't Mind was more or less the first totally gay novel to appear inmainstream bookstores, right at the time that gays began to abandon the closetin droves. Whether one read it or not, it was part of the gay Zeitgeist. As mythree stars suggests, it's not, in my opinion, a literary work. One reviewerlikened it to a bodice-ripper: beauty, adventure, sex. True enough. But thebook is a part of gay history almost by default. It's worth a look."
4,Great love story!,"I first read this story in high school and was totally blown away. I barely knew about the 'gay world' and 'gay sex'. I knew I was on to something when all the 'popular' people laughed at me for even owning a copy of this book. The plot is straightforward. Boy meets boy, they fall in love, life gets in the way, they adapt and overcome, they get back together. The writing is fast-paced and engrossing. I found myself lost in the story too many times. I loved the character development the most. Both Peter and Charlie seem real and grow throughout the story, Their characters are not sacrificed to move the plot along which is the sad case in too many other stories. My only gripe is with grammar. After reading the book twenty-plus times, every little grammatical error jumps out. The writing is poor overall and that's why I took a star off. If you can overlook grammar, this is an incredible story that will lift your spirits and renew your faith in love for all!!"
2,"Big teases, but not a lot of satisfaction","This book was not a bad read and the sex was hot, but there's too many things about this book that keep it from being satisfying. One is that the characters all seem to relish being overly effeminate and can't have speak to anyone without calling them ""darling"". And both Charlie and Peter seem to think monogamy is some kind of quilt and they're fickle as hell. Toward the middle of this first book I didn't particularly care if they ended up together. Not a bad book, but there is so much room for improvement before it could be considered a great one."
4,Surprisingly well-written for its type,"In college I took an English class...We had to read books by people of all ethnic backgrounds (although, naturally, there were no white straight male authors on the syllabus). Anyway,when it came time to read fiction by gay authors, this book was mentioned in a short story by a man who described a bit of Merrick's writing style (of course, his discussion focused mainly on the no holds barred sex scenes). Being a writer myself, and always wanting to ingest new forms of the art, I bought it and was surprised at how well-written it was. The story is definitely soap opera/Harlequin romance in nature, but so what? It works in the context, and Merrick's erotic passages are some of the most excellent written no matter what your fancy is."
1,Bound are we (zzzzzzzzzz)!,"I first saw Boundaries on VHS last year in the unrated version so when it appeared on DVD I jumped at the chance to buy it - big mistake. The vhs version I have is the unrated version (however this review concerns the rated dvd), the dvd version is the rated, or as I like to put it 'nuted' version. Almost all the hot sex has been cut from it, even the pretty tame opening scene with the credits. I can't believe how much this film has been butchered. Thats the only word I can use. I thought the directing lacked zest but compared to this type of draconian slaughter-editing it deserves an Oscar...if you really want to see this film in all it's glory I very strongly suggest you pay the extra extra amount and get the unrated vhs version with all scenes intact and a more coherent storyline..."
2,Better stuff out there.,"Predictable plot, average acting, and an unsatisfying ending. If you want a thriller, look elsewhere. If you want to see a teenager trying to look hot and don't care about a good movie, then here ya go."
1,this murderer is a joke....very predictable.,"This movie is rather boring. It didn't hold my interest one bit. Here we have a sexy murderer that make these victims weak with envy that they let her kill them almost. Like wow.....give me a break. This movie is like Black Widow gone bad....very bad. There are better things to do then waste ur time watching this...like watching paint dry.Only those who only care about sexy but dumb teen murderer would enjoy this movie, which i have a hard time doing because i only enjoy good written and acted movie. Not fake predictable stuff like this."
3,luv 4 cheesy movies,"Not the best acting, but the plot is good. I have been looking for this movie for yrs and find it here for a good price."
5,Great Flaxseed,This brand of flaxseed tastes really good. I favor the golden flaxseed and sprinkle it on my cream of rice cereal with stevia on top. Yum!
4,Delicious and nutritious,"An excellent product inside, I just wish the packaging were different. Information recommends the flaxseed be stored in its opaque packaging. But it's just a bag. So I cut off the top and hope my clip won't slip off and I'll have flaxseed spilled all over the refrigerator shelf. Better packaging might be a shaker container like what's used for parmesan cheese, but opaque.The package is big and you have to buy 4 so even using some every day on my cereal, I will have flaxseed for a long time from this order. Store extras in the freezer, put the one you're using in the refrigerator."
2,Poor quality,"I didn't like the Bob's Red Mill golden flax seed because it had too many pieces of stems and dark, discolored flax seeds in it. I thought the price, compared to some other sellers, was too high. I will not purchase this product again."
5,"Tastes Good, Good for You","Flaxseed meal is very good for you and the Bob's Red Mill is the best. Do follow the suggestion to store in the refrigerator as the milled seeds will go rancid. If you cannot refrigerate and will not be using them in a few months, buy the un-milled seeds and crack them open yourself. They have to be milled for your body to use the great nutrients in them."
4,"Great product, annoying bag","What can I say? It's flax meal, it's healthy, and it's Bob's! My only complaint is that the bags sucks to keep closed, so i have to use a Ziploc freezer bag to keep it sealed for freshness."
1,10/8/12. Be careful,"I have never eaten flax before, and this last Saturday, I decided to add one teaspoon to my oatmeal. After the first couple of bites, my throat started to feel weird, and felt like it was going to close. With each bite, I started to feel worst and worst. After eating less than half of the oatmeal, I poured it out. I eat this oatmeal every day, plain, without flax. No problem. Next, I started feeling warm, my stomach was cramping, and I was puking. I never get sick like this!! I tried to call my doctor, but they were closed. Thought I was going to die."
3,Overprice,Product was fine with the exception it is over price and I don't like it because I had purchased before with Amazon.com and their price is lower....Nutricity has jacked up the price and I will not buy from them anytime soon!!!
2,Difficult to use,Transmit button is small and recessed. This makes it difficult for anyone with limited dexterity or some degree of handicap --- the very persons who would be most likely to need this item.
1,"Slow moving, too wordy.","I bought this to see what this writer was like. Unfortunately, he is not my taste. He's too wordy and not enough action or anticipation. Sorry about that Ed McBain."
5,The best photographs of the Ajanta murals,"The Ajanta caves can be considered among the wonders of the ancient world, both in terms of their artistic and their spiritual value, and this book captures the beauty and detail of the remarkable murals. If I were to make one criticism, it would be that it emphasizes the murals at the expense of largely neglecting the sculptures, which are magnificent in their own right. The book might better be titled, ""Murals of the Ajanta Caves."" I ordered it without seeing it first, and I was a little disappointed to see how few photographs were included of the sculptures. Nevertheless, the beautiful and clear photographs of the murals alone are worth the price of the book, and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone interested in the Ajanta caves, or in ancient Indian or Buddhist art."
5,Beautifully Photographed,"If you are planning a trip to India, you should consider visiting the caves at Ajanta. If you are planning to visit the caves, you should read this book before the trip. You will get a lot more out of the experience of the caves if you know the Jataka stories and understand the Buddhist iconography described in this book.Even if you have no plans to travel to Ajanta, the boook contains beautiful photograpghs which will make a nice addition to any collection of art books or, for that matter, to any coffee table."
4,Great Book - Arrived In a Timely Fashion,Great book. Taking me through all the ins and outs of E-Commerce. It's not perfect with some documented errata on the website. But more than adequate for any coder with a pulse.
5,Estou muito satisfeito de ter este livro !!!,"Dos ultimos livros que tenho comprado, assim como os da serie Head First da O'Really este livro superou muito as minhas espectativas.Como um livro de tutorial foi maravilhoso e me trouxe muito conteudo !!!Realmente vale a pena !!!"
4,"Ferro-Sequels High Potency Iron Supplement caplets, 100-Count","I have tried several iron supplements: this one works best for me, as it was the easiest on my digestive system."
3,The Packaging Was Created by Satan,"This med works well for my mom but I cannot say how much I hate the packaging for this medication every week when I prepare my mother's medication I absolutely hate the difficulty of getting those little green caplets out of the bubble packs. I have never dealt with a more unfriendly package and I'm a nurse, i've opened a few medications."
5,Ferro-Sequels Are the BEST Iron Supplement You Can Buy!,"I have been taking Ferro-Sequels for over 35 years with great success. As a busy music executive with massive stress levels 7 days a week, and with pernicious anemia running in my family, these were recommended to me by my doctor at the time, who was one of the premier internists in Beverly Hills and on the staff of Cedar Sinai. You only have to take them once a day, like a vitamin, I have never experienced any side effects or constipation, and have ALWAYS had stellar iron levels in my semi-annual blood tests! Any doctor will tell you these are truly the best OTC Iron tabs you can buy. Oh and these were the best price and great, fast shipping."
3,Not so great read.,"I am usually a fan of Melanie's books, but this one left alot to be desired for me. I bought it because of the great reviews I saw on here and because I really liked the previous books in this series. The story of John and ""Miss Parker"" held absoutely no appeal to me. The relationship seemed so one sided, even when Nina claimed to herself that she loved John. Everything was forced to me. I had a hard time finishing it, but I forced myself to do so."
5,A fascinating story,Lenin's Mistress is a fascinating story not only about his mistress but about a whole class of people who worked to achieve the revolution in Russia while Lenin was out of the country. The author makes his contempt for Lenin obvious.One of the best books I've read about this period in Russia.This book would also be good for people interested in Women's history.
4,iron suplement,this product really worked for me My red blood count went up from a 9 to a 12 after one week of using this product. taste bad but works grate.
2,expensive,"This is needed due to low iron. However, it is expensive and hard to remember to take at meal time"
3,Good iron product but tastes awful.,"I'd gone without an iron supplement for too long and was feeling the effects. Two friends recommended Floradix so I tried it. I found the flavor/taste to be awful and I could not drink it without diluting it with water. Wanting to get my money's worth, I didn't throw away the product and used up the bottle. After a few uses, I did feel better and I believe my iron levels rose though I did not have any blood tests to validate that. So, I give the product 3 stars for doing what it's supposed to do, but I cannot give it a higher rating because the taste of the product was so bad that I will not order the product again."
4,great mild iron supplement,I recommend this iron supplement to any one. It works. My only complaint is the taste. It isn't awful but it is intense. If you don't like strong flavors I would try the Floradix iron tablets. I think I am going to switch to those once this bottle runs out. It doesn't constipate me or give me an upset stomach and nausea like most other iron supplements I've tried.
5,LOVE IT!,I feel better every day. Had severe anemia and normalized in two weeks. It tastes so wholesome to me I wish I could drink it. I cannot tell you how great this is! Cost...cheaper than commercial vitamins. Priceless when it comes to my health!
5,Cool Stuff!,"It taste like grape juice and is a great product for hair growth. This is my second bottle. Finally, I feel wonderful, especially, with the iron deficieny complex I have sufferred all my life. Use in 4 weeks as directed."
2,Its ok...pay too much for what you get though,"This is simply a concoction of herbs plus cheap ferrous gluconate (you can buy a bottle 100 tabs of ferrous gluconate from your drugstore for about 5$). It hurt my stomach just as badly as the ferrous gluconate tablets did, made me constipated and that makes me cranky - especially when I spent a lot of money on this stuff...If you just want a liquid supplement, try geritol - its way cheaper and works just as well and honestly does not hurt my stomach as much as this did."
5,Excellent,"My anemia was so bad that I was light headed daily. I was so bad sometimes I couldn't drive or walk without my hand on someone's shoulder. I take a little less that the small dose 1x daily. I added pumpkin and sesame seeds, millet, quinioa, and lemon and lime juice to my daily diet as well. MY lightheadedness was gone in less than a week. A blessing from God!"
1,Disappointed!,"I bought this because I suffer from severe anemia and I am gluten intolerant. While Floradix make a statement that this product is free of gluten, when I received my supplement, it contained ""wheat germ extract"". This product is not for people who suffer from celiac or a gluten intolerance."
5,This is THE classic Ferrari book,This book contains the entire history of Ferrari up until the mid-70s. If you are a Ferrari enthusiast of the older cars this is a required book on your shelf. The book contains hundreds of black and white photos as well as several color fold-outs. ISBN 0878800190 is the third revised and enlarged edition of the original Ferrari classic. Note that there is a fourth revised edition. If you are a collector I highly suggest getting a 1st edition and a 4th edition for the comprehensive extra information.
1,A clear miss,"If you're looking for an aid for menu planning, food storage, and provisioning for serious cruising, this isn't the book for you. If you're looking for ideas for week-end cruising, then it might be more useful. If you're a live aboard cruiser looking to get ready for that three or four week passage, look elsewhere for advise. You won't find anything you don't already know in this book.If you're getting ready for your first overnight on your first boat with a galley, and if you've never camped out, never loaded a cooler, never used a microwave or a gas stove, then you just might find something in here you didn't already know."
1,Electrical short circuit problems,"1.0 Cu. Ft. Microwave in Brushed StainlessMy wife bought this product. The first one stopped working after one week or so. So She returned it and another one. Now 2 years later, it short circuits, and trips breakers.HAD TO GOOGLE SOME STUFF, BUT FOUND OUT.I REPLACED $15 OVERLOAD, SO NOW, IT WORKS FINE."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this microwave through Amazon in February of 2008. It is very good looking, very easy to use,but very unreliable. The turntable stopped turning after less than a year. After dealing with thepeople at Cuisinart over the phone, I shipped it to them, and they fixed it and shipped it back to me.But they insisted that I pay the shipping costs both ways, which were substantial and made the actual price ofthe microwave much higher. Now it has stopped heating. So, after less than 30 months,I own a large, good looking clock that used to be a microwave oven. And yes, the turntable still rotates.My first microwave was a Panasonic, which lasted about 16 years. This time, I plan to buy another Panasonic."
1,"An Expensive Microwave With the Name ""Cuisinart"" Should Last Longer","We received this microwave as a wedding gift about three years ago. Today, most of the buttons on the front of it quit working.Frankly, I'll go buy the much cheaper GE or Haier if microwave quality is such a crap shoot."
2,Don't Buy and make same mistake i did.,"Had this item on our Wedding Registry, since it matched our toaster oven and other Cuisinart products. Bad mistake! Had ignored other reviews of the breaking doors and having to return the Microwave by mail to get it fixed, if still under warranty. Shipping costs $50 to Cuisinart, they want a $15 dollar check for shipping back to you. There not getting any more money from me so I just took the $65 dollars and got a Panasonic Microwave. No more Cuisinart microwaves for me, fool me once........"
2,Sudden Death...,"Decent microwave, when it works. Really disappointing, just short of 2 years, the unit died. Light and timer ok... no microwaves, no turntable.Don't be fooled by the very attractive stainless finish... you'll be disappointed. We liked the appearance and full set of features.. until the unit died at a young age. Our previous unit, an old GE Profile lasted 10+ years. Based on web DIY guidance, I attempted a 20amp fuse replacement, no luck still dead. I've run out of time for DIY experimenting, I have a family of 5 that depends on a microwave, for fast easy food reheating. Farewell Cuisinart, you've lost me as a customer."
2,Great for the first 2 years! Beware - it will die and Cuisinart is no help!,"We have thoroughly enjoyed our microwave for the last two years. All of the settings were spot-on. It's easy to clean and it's beautiful - typical of any Cuisinart product. HOWEVER, heed the reviews - it will die after two years. It costs $40 for Cuisinart to even look at it - plus this shipping for you, the consumer, to send it back. It will take 5 weeks for the company to send the microwave back to you. They will not email you any of the return shipping information, so get your pen and paper ready to try to write all of the details. It's ridiculous. You can take it to your local repair shop (which is what I'm doing) and they will do their best to fix it and find parts. Save yourself a lot of hassle and buy a less expensive stainless steel microwave. This one is NOT worth it. Such a shame, too - because I've had the same Cuisinart coffee maker for 6 years and it's awesome. Oh well."
2,Hit it hard and it works,"Used the microwave for about 10 months until one day it wouldn't start. Instead when you push start it counts down the time. I found that smacking the top would occasionally get it to work, until the cook cycle is done. Put something in afterward and it's back to counting down. This microwave rubbed me the wrong way from the start. Wasn't intuitive and I'm not going to bother reading the instructions. Could never set the cooking power and time - just used the pre-set buttons. The start/stop buttons look the same and so I push stop when I want start - can't recommend a microwave that last less than a year and only operates intermittenly when smacked."
1,Broke 1 day after warranty expired,"This was a mediocre microwave, to say the least. I received it as a wedding gift and figured Cuisinart is a reputable brand so I should be fine but I was wrong. First of all, good luck heating something between 30 second intervals! Second, it doesn't heat food evenly. Parts are still frozen while other parts are steaming. Third, one day after our three year anniversary, it broke. Light turns on and makes a nasty buzzing noise but won't do anything else... Save yourself the trouble, go with another microwave!"
2,Measurements on website are incorrect,I ordered this product based on the measurements Amazon listed because I have a tight space in my kitchen. The measurements are several inches off on each dimension. I can only imagine that perhaps the measurements provided are INTERIOR measurements not exterior; since it was not specified I just ASSUMED they were exterior. Very disappointed. I cannot speak to how well the product works since I returned it.
2,Underpowered,"The ergonomics are good all around - but the only thing that should really matter in a microwave oven is speed. And this unit is SO SLOW! It's underpowered. Should be at least 1200, if not 1500 to match the professional look and feel. A 1000-watt unit is only good for a dorm room and one cup of coffee to warm up."
2,Looks Great But Noisy and Not Reliable.,"I bought this based on good experiences with Cuisinart products.Nice looking unit, but the performance and reliability is lacking.Noise: It is so loud that I have to shut the bedroom door in the morning to avoid waking my wife.Reliability: After one year the turntable started operating intermittently. Centering and balancing food on the turntable did not fix the problem. I made sure there were no obstructions underneath (and that the turntable was free to rotate). But the problem remained.Last weekend (at 3 years old) the microwave shut off in the middle of a 10 minute ""job"". The the sides and top were very hot and I am quite sure the magnetron is blown.I Do not recommend this product, but I still swear by my Cuisinart coffe maker and toaster oven."
1,china junk,"i bought this microwave @ bed bath & beyond 2 years ago .and today it blew a fuse. so i took the cover off and went to auto advance and bought a pack of fusescame home and replaced it ,well it just popped three more fuses. So there""s more chinese junk going to fill up our land fills.i have my mothers usa made kenmore i will use. funny this was bought in 1992 and still works."
2,"Great esthetics, very poor service","Excellent design. Stainless steel interior is a plus. However, after 2 weeks, the turntable started squeaking; no amount of cleaning helped. Also, the door edge chipped, so a corner is very sharp. Cuisinart has terrible, unfriendly customer service. To return it would cost $30 or more S&H, even if the unit is defective they don't pay any shipping. They were not helpful - never have been. This is their first microwave and there are few reviews, if any, so you'll have to hope you don't get a lemon as I did. If it had not malfunctioned (turntable) and chipped I would rave about the ease of use and overall design and give it 5 stars. Too bad it's still in ""beta"" test stage."
1,Cuisinart Bought from Store dies after two years,"We bought the Cuisinart, because of its name and reputation. Two days ago, right in the middle of heating rice for dinner, the turn table just stops, two lights pop on that there is no more power, even though the timer keeps running down. For the high cost of the microwave, I sure was expecting it to last longer than two years and two months. It came straight from a Bed, Bath, and Beyond, that my husband and I picked up ourselves, so for the gentleman claiming all the problems of the machines must have come from being delivered or possibly dropped, think again!!!!"
2,Died after 16 months!!!!,"We received this microwave from our wedding registry. We were thrilled when we got it and it worked fine for 16 months, then one died, I pressed 'start' and it totally shut off. I thought I blew a fuse, but nope everything else around it was still working. I tried other outlets and the thing never turned back on! Just like other people said, it just died on us. I thought cuisinart was reliable but I will NEVER buy that brand again."
2,Died after a year!,"Like some of the other commentors, mine died after a little over a year of owning it. Up to that point, it ran fine. Of course, it is out of warranty coverage, and so there is no recourse. I've been a fan of cuisinart for sometime, and I certainly didn't think I'd be having a quility issue so soon. I'm going to have to rethink buying from cuisinart in the future."
1,DON'T BUY!!,Very disappointed in the heating. Takes 90 seconds to reheat a cup of coffee. Solid foods heat uneven. Takes entirely too long to cook anything. Too expensive to return to Windsor. A bad choice!!
1,Not able to enter the cooking time!?,A microwave that has a numeric keypad but doesn't allow you to enter the exact amount of time you want something to cook? This is not understandable. I like cooking my veggie burgers 45 seconds each side. It cooks them just right. Problem: you can't just press 4-5-START on this microwave. You can only cook things in increments of 30 seconds. Give me a break.
1,Took money from my Family,"My wife bought a Cuisinart CMW-100 stainless steel microwave several months ago that has died and will not heat. This is not a little Ipod screen that cost me .62 that I got ripped off from Amazon.com, this was a major purchase whose failure took food out of the mouths of my family...Needless to say we will NEVER buy another Cuisinart product, but I now wonder the value of buying ANYTHING from Amazon again, maybe something under a dollar like an Ipod screen, but nothing ever major again. My wife will be trying to get her money back, I pray she succeeds...."
1,It Sucks!!!!!!,"This is absolutely the worst MicroWave we've ever owned. Unreliable, have to unplug and replug to reset it. It clanks it bangs, beeps way too loud and the noise it makes rivals the jets taking off from a nearby airport. I'm always afraid of waking my wife at night when I use it. This going in the trash as soon as I can make up my mind on what will replace it.This is the only Micro I have ever hated!"
5,So far i love it!,It's a little big for my counter top so i purchased a wall mount shelf. So far it's perfect. I like the features. It works well and looks great.
2,Problem microwave,"I've had two of these microwaves. I bought the first one (black & stainless) and loved the way it looked and worked. It just all of a sudden died after 3-4 months of use. I pushed the start button. It started for a couple of seconds, then shut off. I was able to exchange it at the store I purchased it for another one (white & stainless) for a little extra money. I didn't want to have to pay shipping to send it back to Cuisinart, so I went to where I bought it. After about 6-7 months of use, this one did the same exact thing. While it worked, it worked great, but I guess after having two die, I won't be getting another unless Cuisinart gives me one."
1,Defective,"I purchased this microwave approximately ten months ago. It has great aesthetics, but as others have noted, the rotating glass tray inside tends to wobble. This causes it to make clanking noises as it operates. After working as advertised for ten months it stopped. The digital display still works but the microwave is dead.Overall, this product costs far too much to only work for ten months. Looking at other reviews, this seems to be the norm rather than the exception. Cuisinart is defiantly on my black-list. Buyers beware."
1,Dead turntable - one year and one month old..,"I bought this microwave exactly one year and one month ago. No complaints until today, except it was pretty loud. Today the rotating turntable just stopped dead. Tried unplugging it, no good - still dead. Crumbs aren't an issue - it's very clean inside. A product at this cost should last longer than the warranty period - it's also a lot of metal to just throw in a landfill!! So much for the Cuisinart quality! Don't buy it!"
4,Cusinart CMW 100,"Felt a little sorry for this machine as most reviews pan it. I don't know if it deserves this or not. My first impression is it's a little dated looking. It is about a 6 year old design. I feel it is a bit nosier than the 10 year old Sharpe it replaced but not by much. The controls are different but not hard to get used to. The door handle is very different from other brands but again I got used to it in a day.What I love about it is the inside is stainless steel. Painted or epoxy finishes seem to ""rust"" or bubble after time.There was a comment made prior on not being able to clean the door. It appears very much like any other brand's door, looks cleanable to me!So I am keeping the receipt and box; if it doesn't last 10 years, shame on me. Really do love the interior!"
4,Not a problem to be found!,The microwave is a beautiful appliance with the chrome & stainless steel complimenting each other. Ease of use $ added features make this a very good buy.
3,lasted 2 years,"I didn't have a death wish for this one as I've had for others, that wouldn't die, but it gave up the ghost after only 2 years. It was fine, with convenient minute buttons, though hard to melt butter or boil water properly."
4,"so far, so good","We have had no problem with this microwave...it's been almost 4 months. We really like the stainless, inside and out, and appreciate how easy it is to clean. Admittedly, I was drawn to this model because it is stainless, but it works just as well or better than our past microwaves. The timer settings are a little annoying, but once you get use to it."
1,Poor workmanship for Cuisinart,"Ordered same product twice but returned twice, no fault of Amazon though. Microwave not put together properly at factory. If looking at front of microwave, both were dented and bowed on the right side and also bowed on the bottom, so did not sit flat on counter. Usually have no problems with Cuisinart but poor ""QC"" on Cuisinart's part."
1,Died and died again.,"The first microwave I bought died just before the warranty expired. No lights, no functions, no operation. I paid for shipping, it was repaired and has now died again a year later. The repair warranty lasts only 90 days, so my only option is to pay for shipping and repair based on what Cuisinart decides to charge me. A recall needs to be issued on these units and also on other Cuisinart appliances that have faulty electronics. I have also purchased a Cuisinart 6 bottle Private Reserve Wine Cellar. This appliance lasted 6 months before breaking down and being sent back. Now I use the replacement only on occasion because I have no faith in it. Cuisinart's products look great with the stainless steel. They just don't work. And they aren't exactly cheap."
1,Royal waste of money,"I bought this product based on the Cuisinart name, which I thought was a good one, and the fact that it had a stainless steel interior. The microwave arrived and was pretty to look at and worked well. And the interior was easy to clean. But, it lasted for about 6 months before it conked out without warning. It really was a piece of junk. Save your money and go for another brand!"
1,One month is all it was worth.,"We received this Microwave as a gift for Christmas to replace the 11 year old one that worked fine but was outdated. This CuisinArt microwave looked very nice and worked just fine out of the box for exactly one month. Now everytime you close the door, it turns on by itself and stays on. It just goes and goes and you can't press any buttons to stop it. The only way to stop it is to unplug the darn thing. Now we don't have a microwave because last week, I gave the old one to a good cause. This just happened so I can't comment on how the return of this product will be, but I would certainly steer clear of buying this junk and I would also recommend you NOT buying any small appliance over the internet. There are some purchases that are great to buy online but small appliances isn't one of them. Save your money and frozen food and DO NOT BUY the CuisinArt CMW-100 Microwave! It has a mind of its' own and is quite dangerous."
2,You're paying for the name,"I didn't buy this item from Amazon but thought I would give a review anyway. I have only had this unit for a year and all of a sudden there is no sound, when items are through cooking. No sound when I push any buttons, just all of a sudden died. This is a nice looking unit but for what I paid for it I certainly expected it to operate correctly for more than a year. Could have paid less for something that would have operated better and longer."
5,THIS BOOK WAS REMARKABLE,"I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS REALLY,REALLY,REALLY,REALLY SPECTACULAR!!!!!!!IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE BOOK I EVER READ!!!!!!IT WAS THE A LITTLE SAD BUT REALLY,REALLY,REALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Caution!,"I was quite disappointed by this book, full with bad examples, the girl steals, lies several times, is cruel with her mother and mistreats her brothers with no consequences to all this behavior. Then you have the birds that in the book are told to be the souls from deaths, are we talking about reincarnation? or they are simply demons? for sure there is nothing Christian about this. And is also quite sad, so this book needs a lot of guidance from parents."
2,Nextar MA570,I enjoyed using the player the three weeks that it worked. The FM side started to leak through while listening to a mp3. Then the battery started to loose it's capacity. I have sent it back and am awaiting a new unit.If you purchase this item retain all of your packaging if you need to return it.
3,"Eh its ok, for its price","This is an ok cheap MP3. It does work, ive had it for a few months and it still works, but it loads songs kinda slow, you can only view on song at a time unlike and Ipod. It does have a nice clip if you like to run."
2,disappointment,"The product plays wonder, but this product is not durable. I use it at work and at the end of every work day I bring it home. The usb charger connection doesn't stay in properly. I can't listen while the product charges and the usb connection is loose it won't lock in place. I would not purchase this item for a child."
5,Replaced a broken coffee pot,"I have an old coffee maker from the 1990's and I broke the coffee pot, I ordered this as a replacement and it was perfect."
1,REPLACEMENT PARTS,SEEMS SILLY TO SELL LIDS WHICH ARE LESS LIKELY TO BREAK THAN THE CARAFE WE WANTED THAT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE. lID WAS USELESS TO US...
3,Strap too tight,"I really like these shoes, but the strap was way too tight and they just didn't seem true to size...regretably, they're going back. :-("
3,disappointing though good price,"The ridged colored trim around the control wheel is kind of high and you need to be careful to get to the wheel and controls on it. Also, Nano tends to slide out from bottom (I carried it in my pants pocket and it had come out about a 1/2 inch or so when I took it out--it'd be better if bottom had an elastic to cinch it. Also, you don't have access to the hold button, though that doesn't seem like a big deal since it won't get jostled anyway, being covered by thick neoprene.Overall, it's functional but I wouldn't buy it again; I'd buy something similar with a thicker silicon, probably."
1,for novice only,"first of all, the book on my hand has only 256 pages. I double checked the ISBNs and they match. so i assume there is no ""simplified"" version of this book.i can only say, this book is for pure beginners with no engineering background. Technical content is extremely low. Most of the material can be found on the web.Font size is big and there are many photos (which do NOT necessarily help your understanding) to use up the printable space. appendix A uses up 20 pages and appendix B uses up 40 pages. both of them do NOT deliver any RFID information. seems to me the author is another newbie to the technology (even though he is a senior member of the technical staff at Hill Associates) and information given is bounded by the superficial marketing level. he doesn't contribute any ""insider's"" information. i think Klaus' book is much better in terms of, at least, technical content.to conclude: avoid this book if you need technical stuff."
1,Not worth the money!,"The book seems incoherent, repetitive, almost like glued together with materials from different sources? If the author understand the subject, he is not communicating."
4,Excellent Primer,"Clear, lucid, and to the point.An excellent introduction to RFID for both managers and engineers."
2,NO DRE,"I was really looking forward to this alblum because i thought dre would be producin the beats and other good cali rappers would be on it, but no. It dosent even sound like game rappin, ther are much better songs by him that r not on this cd, i feel that he should have waited n put out a better quality cd, because i kno he is capable of making one that is 5 star"
3,Good Lyrics...Beats Sound all the same.,"If it weren't for the beats....this would be a great album. However, The Game shows that he has talent. ""NeighborHood Supa Star"" is the best song in my opinion. Hopefully, his national debut under Dr. Dre's label is better. GG-GG-GG-Unit!"
3,NOT REALLY WORTH THE MONEY,I personally think game has come along way from this album to where he is now i mean on G Unit songs he rips it up but this album is pretty wack the beats and everything arent good id wait till his album under G Unit records comes out if you wanna buy games music im sure theyll be better producers and guest appearances on it
4,The game with a very good cd.,"The game with a very good cd. a 4 out of 5. Good tracks like Real Gangstaz,G.A.M.E., . Who The Illest, and street kings."
1,No se nada de este album...,PERO ME PICAN LOS HUEVOS Y NECESITO ALGUIEN QUE ME AYUDA A RASCARMELO PORQUE PICAN MAS QUE EL DIABLO!!!!!
2,Umm.....wow,"I think this was the most anticipated album of 2004, because he's a new member a G Unit in all but WOW!! I dont think any song on this album was produced by Dre or anybody from aftermath and g unit records. Its some uknown ""GARBAGE"" rappers rappin wit him. this is terrible, just like g-unit in exception to young buck. please dont buy this, if u are a big g-unit fan and you want to hear this, ""BURN IT"". dont waste your hard earned money PLEASE.AND DON'T FORGET THAT TUPAC CD PEACE!!!!!!!!"
1,This fake thug needs to take his a$$ back to Orange County,"Okay, before everybody flips out, this amateur rapper claims to be from Compton? Wrong, he potrays himself as a Compton thug but he's from Orange County, and has ghostwriters to back his weak skills up. Signing to G-Unit wasn't publicity enoguh for this guy, and now he claims to be the saviour of the game. His skills aren't normal, hard to believe its his own lyrics but hell no, it ain't. And coming out early and trying to mess around with established artists and leading characters in hip hop like Ja and Budden was a stupid move. This guy is the fakest hip hop act since 'Wack A$$' Vanillia Ice, and the commericalism revolving around him at the moment is due to his record deal with the Unit. His only track that made me think otherwise was 'This Is How We Do', but other than that, this dude is phony as it gets.Gurrila Black, stop dissin Biggie you tub of $hit!!"
2,Dr. Dre postponed Detox for this................bad move,"If it weren't for the solid production of Dr. Dre & Eminem, I would reccomend to leave this where you should see it..collecting dust..but it is worth listening to for the beats.That's it. The Game has no real feeling in his voice and his lyrics aren't catchy. Nothing but a big ZERO from this guy...just the first wack rapper from Compton who has no business being compared to Tupac, Eazy-E, E-40, Richie Rich, C-Bo, MC Eiht and the trues from the West. 50 Cent what are you doing puttin this guy with G-Unit and letting him drop his own album off the break? How dare you bench Tony Yayo for The Game?Yayo can eat this guy for breakfast!!!!Tony Yayo-We Need A Solo Album From You Badly!!!! Save the fate of G-Unit...please let The Game be a hype man in one of your videos..G-Unit can do without him... --Tony Yayo, 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Young Buck--drop an album with just you guys that I listed. Game is simply garbage that has been mistaken for talent...."
1,Sorry Game But Your Style Ain't Gangsta !,"Jt The Bigga Figga has released a compilation of some past Game Tracks, and i must say that it is very bad, you can really notice how bad Game's style was back then, i only recommend this for diehard Game fans!by the way he is NOT gonna ""save"" the westcoast, his poor efforts of trying to ruin 50's reputation prove how bad and immature and desperate Game really is...to all those who are interested in Game, he is actually releasing an album soon ! ""The Dr's Advocate"" i think it was gonna be called."
5,"Real Deal, you realize this isn't his debut, right?","Game's debut is The Documentary which is out in the middle of January. Yes Yayo's cd should be fire, but Game real cd isn't out yet. This isn't the G-Unit/Aftermath release. That cd is titled The Documentary"
4,anotha banger,"as always games does it again,just get it,and save me telling yous all how good it is........."
3,Hello everyone,Hey I am back. The old computer had a virus. This was a okay album that had a real West Coast feel to it. It was to generic and sounded like every thing else that was out from the West 5 years ago(When that stuff was not good) I was a fan of one of his mixtapes with Dipset on it. Is the new one better then this
4,Not Tha Documentary,Alright first of id like to say to all you haters out there game is the best out of the g-unit crew i mean listen to his lyrics and his flow no one...no not even 50 cent or banks can touch that....personally i dont even like banks but thats for another review....on to this album there are some good songs for game but he really just sounds different on this album...but not completely in a bad way he is still game and he still has game....but if you wanna hear him at his best either buy the documentary or buy a green lantern mixtape cd and listen to him where he really shines freestylin...i think thats why 50 made a truce with him over there recent beef because he knew that game would murder him if they started a full fleged freestylin beef....anyways buy this and anything that has to do with shady aftermath and gunit records that are simply the new death row....
2,Drinking Game,Bought the product and have not played any games in it. It is basically just a book of drinking games. Didnt like many of the games once I read through them.
2,Plot?,"I bought the book because I wanted to read a sexy book with the plot that's talked about in the blurb on the back cover. Forget it. By the middle of the book, I put it down. In the story, you even see a waiter and waitress together, but if you're waiting for the writer to get back to the plot, you're in for a looong wait."
1,Bassplayer from Mountain,"Yes he is very clever, hi is a great producer and far from cream and mountain this is something very different. Backing from jazz and R&B musicians he has produced a fine musical album. A collectors item for Cream and Mountain Fans."
1,A hellish descent into schmaltz,"Don't Worry Ma was a solo effort by the late hard rock bass player and music producer Felix Pappalardi that was recorded in 1979 with host of top session players--including Eric Gale, Chuck Rainey, and Bernard Purdie--who skirted around the thriving triple Z jazz (jazz plus snooze) scene of the time. Yes, this is the same Felix Pappalardi who played with Mountain and who shaped Cream's sound.After hearing this horrendous, wretched recording, one has to ask why? Why did Mr. Pappalardi think of even going into studio with the plan to produce this stuff? Why did the record company execs allows this session to occur? Why is this musical mess granted the dignity of an import pressing and release? Why would you want to ever play it more than once? (Curiosity is a powerful force, but beyond that. . . )One cannot imagine a worse version of Sunshine of Your Love or why this hellish descent into schmaltz needed to be shared with anyone, ever."
5,2 bad this dude isnt well known,"at the first time a saw this cd i thought i would be main stream garbage whats comin out these days.but from the first song till the last one this cd is bangingo check it out the incapp family.im a true fan.although he sound like down south rap but he,s actually from the mid-west.the best song is most definitly.FEEL LIKE IM A DIE SOON"
2,Hodges is an acrobat!,"He can wiggle and bend more scriptures than I ever thought possible! Consider Corinthians 6:8-9 which reads ""Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers. Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of god."" (and there must be two dozen others just like it) -- but NO, according to Zane Paul is talking about rewards here, not salvation. Give me a break! I can't stand a book that trivializes a truly complicated subject. But Zane managed to do it."
4,"Not compleatly it, but it?","This pendant is beautiful. I was looking for a peice like this, my namestone and my birthstone. (moonstones are very hard to find at a reasonable price, so this was perfect) The stones are clear, all though the amethyst is not pink/purple as in the picture but a light soft lavender and two moonstones are a deep rainbow. When I got it in the mail and put it on the chain, the amethyst in the middle is a bit loose. Not compleatly what I was expecting, but very pleased with it."
4,Students opinion,As an Architecture Student this book has come in very hand. It gives many details of design guidelines and is a wonderful resource book to own.
5,LOVED this video..can't wait for the rest of the series!!!,"What a GREAT video. I love how laid back and casual yet entertaining and educational it is. I can't wait for the rest of the series. Every parent should own this, and buy it for every new parent friend of theirs.Truly a gem, thank you Chef and Father!"
3,The Horse Soldier by Harold Sinclair is a gun smook and horse ---- shjoot em up batch of reading: Recommended to All.,"The Horse Soldier by Harold Sinclair and purchased through Amazon, was not as thrilling as the movie, but never the less very good reading. It did branch off into all directions at times making it a little hard to keep each part in prospective. The auther did bring all the pices together in the end. Thank you J F Current"
2,I really wanted to like it more.,"I was hoping that this pillow would be the answer to all my pregnancy sleeping issues and it just isn't. It's just not LONG enough...I'm 5'7"" but I have a long torso and the pillow just isn't long enough to go around me from shoulder to bottom comfortably. It is difficult to manuever around when you are switching positions in the middle of the night. The cover irritated my sensitive skin (I had a new one made in cotton flannel which helped) and to top it all off, it doesn't give enough support between my knees to stave off serious low-lower back pain. I think it would have worked better had I been shorter and if my legs were not quite so pudgy (the pillow squished easily between them). This pillow is definitely for a more petite woman. I did not find it worth the price tag."
1,Not worth the pricetag,"I was really looking forward to trying this pillow out, and had heard good things from other expectant mothers. However, I was extremely dissapointed after trying it out. As someone else said, the pillow isn't long enough. I'm 5'7"" and my head would hang off the end, so I'd need another pillow to support my head. There's not a lot of fill in the pillow itself, which made me feel less supported, not more. And it made shifting positions during the night downright impossible.I wish I would have gotten a big fluffy body pillow for half the price instead."
4,Good buy,This is a very comfortable sleeping pillow that provides snug support throughout the night. Its nice not having to adjust through the night 3 or 4 pillows around myself to remain comfortable. I only wish the portion that fits through your legs was thicker/fluffier. I still need to use another pillow in between my legs so my hips aren't sore in the morning.
3,Versatile & comfortable,"this body support pillow is comfortable, especially when you first use it. After a while, though, I got tired of how big it was (taking up 3/4 of the bed) and now switch back and forth. I'm also looking forward to using this for when the little one arrives. Overall, for what it is, it's a very soft, easy to position and I like how the cover zips off so you can wash it."
4,It's good!,"At first, I was dissapointed that this book was a comic. I read it anyway because of my curiosity that the writer of the comic is Peter David. I found that this book was quite fun. It has a good story and humor (When ""Bones"" saw a monster carrying its head) and much more. However, the drawings were not nicely done. There are some inaccurate colours and pictures. Nonetheless, this is a good collection for Star Trek fans!"
2,Over rated reviews,"This scope is an adequate scope for wild life or scenery, but for hunting and/or target shooting it is not up to standard. The scope feels light, the tripod is difficult to adjust precisely, and at the highest magnification the view is blurry/fuzzy. The light is adequate, but the blurry image is a big minus. Even for the price I would expect something a little better. Returned it for refund."
3,Barska Blackhawk 20-60x60,"This item is inexpensive because it isn't as good as the ones that cost 2 to 10 times as much. But it still works. It's light weight and seems rugged. It came with a hard case that was way better than what I expected, and a soft case that is nice too. The little tripod is cheep but works. I like it just fine."
2,This is built pretty cheap.,The optics are not good. It is a very cheap import. It gives me a head ache looking through this thing for more than 30 sec.The stand is very light cheap thin metal.. Useless really.If you are really really broke and just have to have something right now and you put all your money in to a good rife and scope i guess this will kind of work. It's ok at 150 yards if you have good eyes but at 300 its a lot tougher to see double hits and hits on black lines.You would be a lot better off and save your money up and get a good scope. Just step up a little. 250 to 300. you get what you pay for.
3,Not as good as expected,Not as good as expected. Was poor for use as you couldn't switch from one power to another. This is the first product I purchased from you that I wasn't happy with. This was not a good buy for the money. I usually shoot at a 200 yards and this doesn't works.
1,What Eye Relief ..,"For being a cheap(er) spotting scope, it would be ok other than at higher power settings (50-60x) it's like putting in your contacts. If the manufacturer would incorporate a glaucoma detector on the lenses, you could regularly have a checkup while viewing using higher power settings since you HAVE to all but put your eyeball on the lens to see anything larger than a pinhole. Hence the ""what eye relief"" comment. The tripod included is fine for the price. The case is nice for the price. Cheaply made of course but usable. A good Pelican case will be at least 1/2 the price of this scope.Returning to replace with Binoculars with tripod mount....should be much better solution for 50% more cost. This is first Barska product and doubtful will buy more. Should have just stuck with Nikon products that I already own and know their specs are accurate to make good buying decisions with."
1,Not what I expected at all.,"Expected a medium grade spotting scope with nice accessories. Instead, the optics set at 60x were hazy and the case was so beat up it looked as though it was used. Scratches, dings, dirt, glue, fingerprints were all over the hard case. Very poorly made and would not recommend this brand or this model. Could have done and will be doing business elsewhere."
1,questional performance?,"I bought this as a quick replacement for my high end Leupold which was stolen. Needed a spotting scope for a few months and plan on buying another Leupold when I return to the U.S. in 24 months. The best I can say so far is it works. Optic clarity is fair, light gathering at higher power is somewhat a disappointment even at the price. I have a feeling one good bump or drop will probably ruin the thing, Very light in weight and the body does not feel very solid. It was cheap and that filled my needs but I would recommend you move up in quality and spend the bucks for a quality spotting scope."
4,good buy,i was very surprised by the quality and also the prices for other scopes in dicks and walmart either being to over priced or poor quality. The hard case is very nice great for brining out in the feild i havent even took the soft case out of the plastic the only reason i didnt give this product a 5 was the tripod is basically useless its at a uncomfortable height when on a table and its not adjustable poor quailtu other then that I'am very happy with it.
4,BARSKA BLACKHAWK,"Perfect for my purpose which is spotting holes in paper at the range. No problems seeing targets out to 300 yards, has a nice crisp clear picture. Eye relief is pretty much non exsistent for me but really isn't a problem because I'm working from a bench. Great scope for the price!"
4,Very Good Spotting Scope For Money,"This was my First Spotting Scope and It's very nice has great field of view. I like that it came with a hard case, I wasn't worried about soft case. But it very crisp and clear. No Complaints, I will deffenetly be buying a another one with a larger more powerful field of view. I would refer this to anyone who loves the outdoors."
5,Serious Spotting Scope,This ones for the serious shooters who don't want to deal with the lesser quality scopes. A great product and a great price
3,Good- but VERY Limited Eye Relief,"Was surprised how good the construction quality of this scope was- especially for the money. Quite good.Only reason for the 3-star rating is the extremely limited eye relief- it is pratically non-existent and takes some getting used to practically having your eyeball on the lense. I knew this when I bought it, from other reviews- so it is as advertised.Takes some getting use to, but would still recommend for the money."
4,Does the job,"I like it! easy to use, excellent focus, the light is OK, it could have been brighter with a bigger lens. I don't care much for the included tripod, hence the 4 stars instead of five. I use a full size tripod instead. Good quality product"
5,Idries Shah on 'The Key of Solomon' and more,"This book, which is out of print and quite hard to find a copy of (took me 3 years to find a copy myself, and then finally it was through Amazon), is one of Idries Shah's more esoteric ones. In fact the book is not listed on any of the books-lists under his name (for instance you can look at http://www.octagonpress.com/~sufi/shahbook.htm).This book is truly a treasure-house when it comes to esoteric material and I can only recommend it.But I will also draw attention to some of I. Shahs other books, for instance ""Learning How to Learn"" and ""The Sufis""."
3,Too Big,The low power images are fine. As the magnification increases the crispness of the images deteriorate but not to unacceptable levels for the shooting range. The problem with the scope is it's too big and too heavy and the tripod is not up to the task. It's embarressing to whip out the Hubble Space Telescope and have it topple over.
3,Big Scope,"I bought this scope for wildlife viewing. I didn't realize how large this thing is. Trying to mount this scope on a tripod is like mounting a canon on a step ladder. It is best used on a car window mount. I suggest only using it on a hand cranked window. I made an adapter For my tripod that works like a window. Using a piece of aluminum angle 2 1/2"" x 2 1/2"" x 3/8"" x 3 1/2"". I drilled and taped It to match the treads on my tripod after the ball mount was removed. It works good though not as steady as a car window. The tripod that came with it is in no way suited for this scope. It would instead be a nice miniature tripod for a camera. The carrying case is nice,but the eye piece dust cover is junk. Lastly the optics are at best only fare. As you approach 75 power the image gets a little blurry. But the money is not bad. all and all, I am satisfied. Too want better is to pay more."
1,Don't buy!,"I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews... I saw this, loved the color and look and the price was right for me. I read the reviews and figured how bad could it really be??? BUT I WAS WRONG!!!! I regret every penny spent on this and every minute spent putting it together!-Pros:none-Cons:1.I opened the box to find multiple scratched and cracked pieces. It is not made out of wood but essentially cardboard! I guess you get what you pay for.2.The holes are at times difficult to line up and so the whole product at the end was kind of crooked and off balance3.Not sturdy enough to have someone sit on bench! I would worry the whole thing would just collapse on the person.4.The color is really off in the photo. It is not an off white but mor elike a light peach or powder pink color.I have to now find out how I can return this product. It really shouldn't have ever been sold on amazon in the first place!"
5,on point,"I liked this movie because, it was based on real events. I would like to have this movie on dvd but,it is only on vhs at this time. This is a great movie."
3,battery pack,Nice looking battery pack. Tyhe only drawback I see is that it does not seem to hold a charge too long. I use my camera sparingly and it seems I have to check this battery evvery few weeks and charge it.
5,Replacement battery,I purchased this battery to replace the original battery that came with the camera. We recently used it and it performed very well. It held it's charge as expected.
5,Eye opening,"While the study on cats is depressing (as a cat lover) I found it eye opening. It is more heart breaking because this is exactly what we have done to ourselves. We are literally starving our bodies and are falling apart. As our bodies fall apart, the medical community continues to label new diseases...so much so that a new set of diagnosis codes has to be created just to handle them and the ones they know will come in the future. As a doctor, I have seen people improve just by improving what they put in their mouths. Changing our diets to more whole foods...REAL food...makes a BIG difference! If you want to see what we are doing to ourselves and our children, this is the perfect place to start reading. Then...do something about it!"
5,awesome product,everyone who wonders the difference between raw vs pasturized milk and cooked vs uncooked foods & meats should read what this great researcher discovered when he did it.
2,pottenger's cats,"i gave this a 2 for 2 reasons:1. the quality of the printing shouldn't even get a star. i got the book and 40 pages in and it is not a very large book, the binding fell apart. it is of very cheap quality.2. the actual information is very informative and enlightening but there seemed to me to be things that didn't seem to add up and i really couldn't identify with suggesting that humans eat undercooked meat, brains and liver...yuck!!!"
2,too enlighten others,"I was very let down as to the quality of this dvd. The scenes are all the same and the snow is not real. I was expecting real snow scenes and real snow fall. The music was very good, only thing that was worth buying."
2,"Surprisingly bad, the worst in the Time-Life series","I've found the Time-Life series to be generally well done, presenting mostly introductory and basic material, but at least accurate. This volume is an exception. Despite conferring with Robertson, Jackson's main biographer, the author still repeats the myths about lemons, Jackson standing sole guard for his army, etc. etc. Overall the analysis seems light and the maps, which are very good in some other volumes, are too few. This book seems to me to only be worth reading for the illustrations. Skip it, and get Tanner's book instead."
2,Not that great!,"I just purchased this item last week to use at work since it's cordless. I work out on my lunch, and so I needed the straightening iron to touch up my hair afterwards. I have naturally curly hair, and use a straightener every morning. When I used the Revlon straightener today, I was very disappointed. It doesn't get hot enough to straighten my hair at all. It leaves waves in it, which is not what I expected. I would definitely not recommend this iron!"
3,Solid construction,"This drill index is solidly made but not precision. Bits can fit in holes up to 2 sizes smaller than the proper hole. Which was disappointing because that was why I ordered it. I have a fractional index they made 35 years ago and it is still solid and accurate, so this one should last. I can't see the nano-type stamped on the bits anymore and was hoping this index would keep them sorted - no such luck."
4,Hasn't changed much over the years,"I bought two of these to add drills which I've had for years, but never indexed. This index is very similar to ones 30 years older, with the exception of the hinge. The older one had a real continuous hinge with pin. Works okay, though."
1,waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this item was a gift for my father in law , it is as small as my palm , therefore a waste of time , he does not even have a bit to fit in it . the holes are so tiny. it cannot fit even a nail. waste of money , man power and time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! measurement are not what was described."
2,For a complete Copland piano music investigation only,"To be franck and straightforward, Nina Tichman can at no moment compete with the complete mastery in such works as the sonata and the variation achieved by David LIVELY on Etcetera (Piano variations, sonata and fantasy). Her playing seems to lack the necessary tension required by these works. The two volumes have the merit however to provide a full survey of Copland piano works, although I have not been able to find interest in them probably because of the described playing which seems to hesitate between low tempi and manierism. For an outstanding view of Copland major Piano works you need to hear David Lively first!"
4,Two strong characters,Margaret shows us that taking a chance leads into a life she would have never dreamed of. The mysterious Kieran is to dream about.
3,Disappointed,I enjyed the first four tapes in this six tape series. My disappointment came when I discovered that much of tape five and all of tape six were simply verbatim repetitions of earlier lessons. I felt cheated.
5,A sensational read for girls 6-9,My daughter is five and is spellbound by this book. A wonderful mix of fantasy and magic brought home to the life of a little girl and her cat. The illustrations are simple and effective. I am now going to look for other titles by this author. Bravo!!
5,:),"--Caroline is asking her parents if they believe in fairies on the way to the local museum when one appears in the back of the car! Her name is Hillary, and though she doesn't have wings and looks like a normal girl, she does indeed prove to be a fairy. --The family's months with Hillary are well portrayed in this fun and lively story. --Marisa"
2,Weber has sunk into the usual trap of an author who writes too many books,"I've read several of Weber's stories and been very pleased with them. However, with Primary Target, he has fallen into the trap that so many authors fall into when they write too many books. His characters have fallen into a pattern of patter that is cute and predictable, and become chummy as if they both speak the same way. His military exploits are not up to his usual snuff, as he spends little time on that end of things. This is the same sort of problem Clancy started to get into in his later Ryan novels and that Heinleins works suffered from starting with Friday. A huge disappointment from an author who has proven he can do much better. Two stars for a good story line and the beginnings of the potential for great techno-thriller descriptions, but I can't give it more because of the poor characterizations and short shrift given to the descriptions of the action."
4,"""Action At Full Military Power""","A stellar action novel! Hard-line Russians team up with Iranian-backed terrorists to bring chaos to the U.S., culminating with an assassination attempt on the President. The action scenes are masterfully done. Great drama leading up to the first airliner crash. The massive air/sea battle in the Persian Gulf was incredible. Very fast-paced and exciting. What happens at the Atlanta airport when everything goes to crud with Air Force One coming in is crush the armrest dramatic. Cord Macklin is the kind of President this country needs! Take charge fighter pilot-type that will push back when pushed too far. And what a push he delivers. Rest of the character development is OK. In some areas the dialogue didn't seem natural. But overall, Grade-A awesome book."
5,Something to read if your a Big #20 fan,"I thought that this book is ""The Real"" Tony. Describing how ""humble"" his beginnings was is very refreshing to read. After reading this, makes me even a bigger Tony fan as you get to know him as a person and not as a bratty race car driver. I highly recommend anyone who is a real Tony fan to read this. Reading about all of the names in sprints (Stan Fox, Rich Vogler,),silver crown, his rough tenure in IRL, and finally his rise in NASCAR it is a great history lesson."
5,WOW!! I love Tony even more now!!,"This book is great!! I would recommend this book to any Nascar fan, not just those who love Tony!! When I began reading this book--I absolutely could not put it down! Read the entire book in just one night. It is definitely a true look inside the life and heart of Tony Stewart. The first few chapters are a little hard to follow as he leads you through his start in racing but as you read on into the book and start hearing of all of his adventures in racing and with the media, you are just dying to know more. I just hope that Tony doesn't let it end here, I am sure that there will be more excitement in his life in the next few years and maybe he will write ""True Speed 2--A story of a Winston Cup Champion""!! I would recommend this book to everyone and want to wish Tony (if he happens to read this review)----GOOD LUCK IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP Race in 2002!"
5,Why does Tony act that way?,"That's a question that race fans have either heard or wondered a good deal over the past few years. To anyone who's followed the sport of NASCAR for a few months two things become obvious: Tony has an unbelievable amount of talent and he seems to attract trouble. Some are his doing and some is not.In ""True Speed"" you'll get a lot of background information on Tony the person and Tony the racer straight from himself. There are certain things in life that motivate us all. Tony explains his desire to succeed and attempts (successfully if you ask me) to explain what motivates him. If you've ever wondered why Tony acts the way he does, read this book and find out."
3,CHEAPLY MADE,"IT GETS THE JOB DONE, BUT THINK IT MAY NOT LAST VERY LONG. VERY CHEAPLY MADE, LID COMES OFF TOTALY OR ITS ON, DOES NOT JUST OPEN. I EXPECTED IT TO BEALOT BETTER QUALITY."
5,One of the best rollers ever .,"I recommend this product to anyone who wants big , sexy voluminous curls. These curls last all day . They don't even need any product to hold in. It's good for a night out . It's fast easy and beautiful.!"
1,Revlon Ionic hair roller setter,I don't like this item. It's too hard to set hair; the clips donot work for me.
1,picks won't hold rollers,picks won't hold rollers. there is nothing else to say. Very Disappointed. Nothing Else to say. Picks won't hold rollers
2,KK,"I would not recommend this item. The lid is really not attached just like the other people said. The worst thing are the pins to hold rollers on your head - they fall off very easily. Overall, I was not satisfied with the purchase and I returned it right away."
2,Too hot to handle & difficult to use,"I tried these for a couple of weeks; they were very hot to hold while rolling, the pins were very tricky to use, and becasue of their small size, they made made my mediun length hair too curly.Passed the set on to my sister who did not like them either, and have now given them to my niece who like anything that's free:)Wish I had tried the Conair flocked roller set instead."
3,Only okay,I have used the curlers once since i got them yesterday and i wasn't that impressed. They work pretty well but even after you use hair spray the curls only stay in for about 30 minutes. Then your hair falls flat. It isn't even wavy. I liked my friends' curlers but they were velvet kind of and they worked better. They were conair. The Revlon curlers don't hold your hair in because they are all plastic so your hair doesn't stay. Over all i wasn't that impressed. I would definatly return them if i could. And the first time they heated up they smelled AWFUL!I wouldn't recomend them to my friends.
3,Revlon Hairsetter,Having shorter hair the only curlers I use are the smaller and medium sized rollers. I could really use more smaller rollers and it would be nice if extra pins were included.It does curl your hair fast but not very long lasting.
5,Awesome Rollers!,"Having read all reviews, I decided to try this set based on positive feedback and price. I am so thrilled with the results from my first use! My hair is shiny, has held the curl( even on a summer day with an outside temp of 95 and major humidity!!). My previous set was Conair Velvet rollers and they never held the curl. The plastic on that set broke immediately, I feel this Revlon hairsetter is durable and easy to use. I recommend it highly."
3,not travel friendly,"Set is not travel friendly at all. Clear plastic lid broke within weeks. Also, rollers do not heat as fast as stated. I do, however, like the design of the rollers themselves. My fine hair doesn't stick to the roller like some I have had."
1,Horrible product!,"I don't usually write reviews but this product is absolutely horrible.When it arrived the top had already snapped off and I have yet to figure out how to snap it back on.There is no way to indicate when the rollers are ready - you have to guess.The clips don't work - they don't grab the rollers and, if you move, they fall off and fly across the room.I am surprised that Revlon is selling such an inferior product."
1,Very Unhappy,"The lid is not attached, so when you carry it anywhere, if you don't have a good grip all over it, the lid slips off and scatters the clips all over the floor. The ends are NOT cool - I have burned my fingers every time I used them. The clips are not tight, and adjusting them makes your fingers burn more. I'm online now trying to find another, different set. Don't waste your money."
2,Not What I Had in Mind,I did not care for the rollers or the fact that the lid is not hinged. Just not what I was looking for; they were returned.
2,Too hot to handle,These rollers heat up very fast and if more than 5 mins lapse they are very hot to handle and burn your head a little. Otherwise they work.
4,Definitely a good buy,"I have been looking for a good set of curlers at a reasonable price for a while, these are just that! My hair is a bit past my shoulders and usually will not hold a curl for any length of time over an hour. But the first time I used these, even after I brushed out my hair later that day, my hair stayed relatively styled. I did not leave them in very long as I usually also have trouble with my hair sort of poofing out for a while after I curl it if I leave anything in for more than a few minutes, but again, not the case with these, I had soft curls all day, even right after I took the rollers out. So I'm looking forward to really being able to use these and not completely frying my hair."
3,Overall good,I got these to replace a fifteen year old set that I loved!!! But it finally died. I was happy that it had the pins to hold the rollers instead of the clips becuase they hold much tighter and better. The only problem that I had is that they don't all heat evenly. Some get extemely hot to where they burn your fingers and then others will just feel warm. They still work and the curl holds.
4,End result not so good,"I LOVED these rollers. No kinks in my hair and long lasting curls. However, I have owned them for some time and when I went to use them this morning, I found that the whole back row had melted into the heat box. Now that I have to replace the rollers, I am wondering if this is the brand I will buy again. The safety issue worries me."
5,Impressed,"Having owned my first & only Hot Roller set for about 5 years, I was very impressed after using the Revlon RV261 Hot Rollers. My hair is very fine, with little or no curl retention, using this set my curls are smooth, and hold up very well. Easy to use, heats up within 10 minutes or less."
4,Pretty cool,"I got these last year because I was hoping not to spend a whole lot of time on my hair but have it look ok. They work great on my medium to long fairly thick hair. They leave my hair pretty curly. Who's idea it was to put the unattached PLASTIC cover on it??? They get hot enough, but they take a while to heat up. Overall i like them."
3,Disappointed,"I've been using hot rollers for close to 40 years and have never had the trouble I have had with this product.I store my rollers in a drawer and take them out every morning to roll my shoulder length hair. Inevitably when I pick the unit up from the drawer, the plastic top which is not attached, falls off and all the curlers tumble out. Also, the clips seem inadequate for the rollers. The clips are not secure and will work their way off the curler. I have tried using the clips in every position possible because the standard way doesn't hold the roller. However, nothing seems to help and they always pop off one by one to the floor with the roller close behind.The curlers do their job and curl your hair if you have patience with the clips."
3,its ok,its really hard to try and put the curls on after they have heated up because i seem to burn myself every time i try to get it right the product is a good product but should of made it easier to put them on l
2,Poorly designed,"The clear top or cover on this product constantly flips off if you pick it up to put it away. The rollers also fall from my hands constantly. I feel I have butterfingers handeling this but my daughter has the same problem as me. My husband asked what's wrong with us, then he picked it up and the whole thing ended up on the floor. I wish I purchased a different set."
1,JUNK ! ! ! !,"Ordered the rollers in Dec. Loved them at first. Noticed that they were losing heat as time went on. Come March getting ready to go out for my Birthday, turned on the rollers, blew dry my hair, went to roll my hair and the rollers were stone cold. Power was on. tried plugging it in to a different power sorce. and nothing... Tried them a few times after that and still nothing. I guess you get what you pay for. They were only 20 something. But I know I'm going to stay away from Revlon on my next purchase.Joan in Pa"
5,easy to use,These curlers are so easy to use and will actually stay in!The clips that come with them work great as I was a littleunsure about them. The cover is not connected at as it appearsbut doesn't outweigh the benefits of the curlers.
3,Revlon RV 261 IONIC Hairsetter,"The problem with this hairsetter is that it absolutely gets TOO hot.I love the style, and the curlers, but I have to wear cotton gloves to use this."
4,Good Rollers,"My wife as yet has had no complaints about it, I guarantee if anything was not perfect she would complain."
4,Very Good Hot Roller Set,"Wife said it's an excellent set, only problem she has with it is the case says she would rather have a flip top."
5,I like!,"I have asian hair. first time I used it, I left it in my hair for 30 mins (because I was running around) and the curls (more so waves) lasted the whole day!I did not add any products to my hair, no hair spray, nothing.I say waves because I didn't place the rollers for curls so they came out as waves.hair was soft, shiny.good product for the price. efficient at curling my kind of hair. (which is, and always will be naturally straight no matter what I do to it)."
1,Quit after two uses,Poor design; cheaply made. I didn't even bother to return it since I'd thrown away the packaging. NEVER will buy another Revlon product again.
3,Revlon RV261 20-Roller Professional Hairsetter,"This product was very nice, however, it doesn't work well with shorter hair. The rollers don't stay in. I purchased this for my mother who has a bit shorter hair. She is keeping it, but try as she might she is unable to get the rollers to stay in her hair in order to use the hairsettter."
1,Curlers burn hands and scalp; unit lacks thermostat,"This unit was bad in so many ways that I returned it after one try:-There is no way of knowing how long to wait before the curlers heat up--the booklet doesn't say and there is no way to tell on the unit itself.-The curlers are so short that it's almost impossible to only hold the cool end while manipulating your hair over the entire curler (there is a cool end and a very hot end to each curler)-The metal holders do not not hold hair on the curlers-The curlers burn the scalp-The cover won't stay on if the unit is shifted at all.Soooo-""one star"". I would have given it ""no stars"" if that had been an option."
1,not happy,"I am definitely not happy with this set of rollers. I purchased them recently because, after 20+ years with my previous set, I was ready for something new and improved. Well I tried them several times this week. I find them to be slow to heat, and then unevenly heated. Some of my medium length hair took the curl well, while other parts refused to curl. (Maybe the rollers are defective?) The result was a messy hairdo each time I used them, and I did try different technique/heating time each time I tried. I don't know, but I do know that I put them away today, and went back to my OLD curlers. They may not be pretty, but they do the job every time. I also want to say that the quality of the new product seems very ""junky"" to me. The old ones are much more sturdy. Sadly I threw all the packaging away when I opened them so now I cannot even return them. UGH!"
3,so slick they fall out,I am holding onto this with the hope that longer hair will allow me to use them. they are so slick that the roller just falls out . I am still using a handheld curling brush for now.
2,Incomplete Guide to Search Engine Marketing,"I found the title of this book and the book description to be a little misleading. I thought I was purchasing a book that described a complete approach to Search Engine Marketing and SEO. This book devotes practically every chapter to Google AdWords and only one brief final chapter on SEO/improving organic search ranking. In fact, the author even states that an entire second book would be needed to cover the topic. I thought I WAS buying that book based on the product description. On a positive note, this book is great for anyone just getting their feet wet with pay-per-click advertising. The author explains that this should be the first step in getting on the first page of a search engine, but I did not expect the entire book to be on this one subject. I just feel mislead by the book title and the way it was marketed."
3,Credibility concerns,"While not judging the overall content in the book, there are a couple of items that raise credibility questions.She suggests typing 'search engine marketing book' into Google (page 22) to see the placement of an ad for the book. It's not there. OK, so perhaps the campaign has been turned off -- was it unsuccessful? Low ROI? In addition, the findability website [...] does not appear in the first 100 organic results -- not a real confidence builder.The examples throughout the book seemed overly simplistic, e.g., chapter 7. To compensate, page 80 states that fully built out examples will appear on the website. Unfortunately I could not find them.The anomalies above gave me pause, despite the impression that the techniques in the book are no doubt valuable."
5,Great starting point,"As a beginner in the world of SEM, I needed to learn terminology and basic techniques. I have to say this book was an easy and quick way to accomplish both. It is for beginners and I will be using another book to learn more advanced techniques. Shows practical ways to organize a campaign from start to finish."
4,great value,"If you umpire like me, I do a ton of mask on/mask off throughout the whole game. This mini hat is perfect for this sort of umpiring. I have this for during the game (behind the plate) and another normal billed hat for umpiring on the bases.Solid value for the money. Overall rating would be a 4.One con - it is not fitted, only a velcro strap"
2,umps caps,"the hats that i ended up getting were 2 different styles. i was unaware of that. one style was better then the other. for 11.98 a piece, i sort of expected matching styles since i ordered them from the same site."
3,A mixed bag,"Final Cut Pro 6 is a fantastic tool; a mature app with great features and rock-solid implementation.Soundtrack Pro 2 (specifically 2.0.1), on the other hand, may be the worst piece of commercial, non-beta software (based on the severity and frequency of fatal/non-recoverable errors) I have ever had the misfortune to use. Of course, your mileage may vary, but I would advise anyone to think twice or three times about using Soundtrack Pro 2 for any sort of serious and/or mission critical application. Check the various boards/forums dedicated to Soundtrack Pro 2 and you will see that I am not alone in this estimation. Hopefully, Apple will soon see fit to patch this inexcusably buggy piece of software."
5,the best -- i use it everyday,"i use FCP everyday. i wish i knew more of the programs, but FCP and DVDSP and Comressor are my lifeblood.one day when i have more time, i'll write about all the reasons why."
5,Metabolift,"This is a re-order from a different vendor. Metabolift is an excellent product that I've used for many years. It provides energy without the jittery side-effects of some stimulants. I find it great for weight control, not weight loss. This was a great buy too as my local stores no longer have it in stock."
2,Metabolift,"I had high hopes for this product that it would take the place of energy drinks and the quick energy ""shots""..however it has not proved to do so. Since several people told me this really fired them up I took a chance and ordered a bottle, but since I have now almost finished the bottle there is no decernible difference in my energy levels or weight condition. On the plus side, there have been no side effects either, so I guess I shouldn't complain. It has proved to be a general waste of time and money..apparently it does work for some people, but it is a little expensive to have to buy a big bottle to find out."
1,rate the product,the product is very bad -----i used it now for about 3 weeks and i didn't lose even one kilo of my weight ---i can say that this is the worst product i've ever take
3,A Word of Caution,"I have been looking over a bunch of supplements recently after reading about the effectiveness of an ECA stacker but not being able to readily find the ingredients to make it myself. Anyway, I have not used Metabolift but heard of it, so sorry if this messes up their rating but one thing I want to warn any women who are on any type of BC-- this product lists St. John's Wart as a main active ingredient-- it's used commonly as a mood improver and to ward off depression. I looked into St. John's Wart before, it is HIGHLY recommended NOT to take anything w.St John's if on any form of birth control pill or patch. It can absolutely negate the effects of the contraceptive. I'm looking into Ripped Fuel instead (good reviews) and possibly hydroxicut, but of course not if they too have St. John's Wart."
3,body Lotion is too runny!,"While the Tea rose perfume is fine, the body lotion is virtually unuseable, as it is very runny (like milk!) and spills all over the bathroom."
2,Tea Rose Perfume and Body lotion,My daughter loves this perfume. She was thrilled to receive this gift for Christmas. The Tea Rose perfume is like the old fashion rose fragrance.
1,Bad,It smells so strongly and I have a headache...I don't like it...I don't recommended it.My husband hates.
1,never again,the spray was ok the lotion was water and had no scent. Must have been on shelf for a long time. Will never buy again
2,EWWWWWW!,This is horrible! The lotion is like creamy water and smells like roses and urine! I hate I spent a penny on this crape. Not worth a nickel!
5,Happy to find it at last,"I have used Tea Rose for years, I'ts the one fragrance people comment about when I'm near. "" I smell roses"" I have'nt been able to find it in local stores. Thank you Amazon."
4,Great product,"The scent is exquisitely rose-like. The only reason why this is not getting 5 stars is that the lotion for some reason is too fluid that one has to refrigerate it, otherwise it will flow too swiftly like bottled water."
5,Really good!!!,"I absolutely love this perfume! It is such a unique scent. My friends say to me that they know I am around when they smell the sweet roses. The only thing I was annoyed with is that the lotion was a bit too watery. It could have just been a one time product problem. However, I still recommend this product to anyone that I do not know. I don't want to run into people that have the same signature scent as I."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"What a waste - just a dumb, amateur stage show - couldn't get past the first few minutes. Had to stop it, and find another DVD to watch. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS ONE!"
2,Glad I Paid Just ... For It!,"I found this video at a major dept. store on a ... rack last year and decided to give it a chance. My daughter, who was 4 yrs. old, actually got hooked on it for a brief time, which surprised me, because I found it pretty ridiculous and the quality of the material seemed low-budget in every aspect. I had a hard time sitting through it. However, I've paid much more for popular videos that she showed considerably less interest in. I guess you never know what children will find entertaining, as this somewhat strange video proved."
1,"Uninspired, dreadful","Maybe I am cynical or jaded, but this video is horrible. It's uninspired, unimaginative, cloying, and very grating. The animal characters speak in jokey, ""cartoon-character"" voices, the type that grown-ups with no sense of humor think that kids like. Furthermore, the animals' dialog is nearly unintelligible because of the over-exuberant ""funny"" delivery. I found this video to be just horrid, made with no particular joy or flair."
1,dreadful excuse for kids entertainment,"this was horribl and it is NOT disney. It is a kids film that kids can't even sit throug, horrible"
5,Finally someone uses their brain,"The remasterd sound of the tracks is excellent!I might buy volume one even though I own all the tracks on other cd's just because of the sound. Some very hard to find tracks are on here.The oddball track is Felix-Don't You Want My Love?This track was produced in 92-93,and I wouldn't consider this a flaw."
5,"Grand indeed,superb sound quality.","An amazing collection of tracks with blistering sound quality.My 1500 watts 8 speakers with dual 15"" sub-woofers stereo multi-channel system is just kicking..my brick walls are not happy with the vibration but iam not easing the pressure."
2,narcissistically delusional,"All you Donovan fans can make excuses for this sloppily written claim to have invented the air we all breathed in the sixties, but wow, this book is mostly an embarrassing drag. For all the information that is useful, it pales next to the inevitable cringe that is just around the corner when he takes credit for his amazing prescience for everything imaginable. A gift from a flower to a garden? More like the gift from a turd to a punchbowl."
2,"A little flaky in places, but interesting","I like Donovan and have many of his albums and enjoyed this book overall. The writing style is simple and to the point and its neat to hear about his circle of famous aquaintances (e.g. George Harrison, Marc Bolan, etc). However, his bragging about all his ""firsts"" in the music world wears a little thin after awhile, as do his rather flaky references to meditation, astrology, etc. He and Linda were ""meant to be"" - how trite; really, is anything ever ""meant to be""? After 60 years of life, I guess I expected more wisdom than this! The book stops at 1970, so don't expect to hear anything about what he's done in the past 35+ years. Unless you're an avid fan, I'd pass on this one..."
2,Not the worst rock bio ever,"I dig Donovan, so I'm going to continue plowing through this book. It is not the worst rock bio ever. That award goes to ""No One Here Gets Out Alive"" by Jerry Hopkins and Danny Sugerman.I love this sentence: ""I had studied the Japanese paintings of Van Gogh and Gauguin."" Ah, so desu ka?A few of the many misspelled names:Alvero StreetWhyskey-A-Go-GoAli Akba KhanJoaney BaesWaight AsburyStevie Windwood"
5,who is Brian Setzer ?,"My dad loves this DVD. I didn't know what Brain Setzer looked like or that he played the guitar like a demon! I like the songs DRIVE LIKE LIGHTNING and the amazing guitar solos on MYSTERY TRAIN. This DVD is very very cool! There are lots of different types of tunes. Swing, rock and roll, rockabilly,and a ballard which setzer sings on his own with just a guitar. My school friends say, who is Brian Setzer ? I reply, watch this DVD and you will see the greatest rock and roll guitarest ever ! Five stars ! No more Britney for me. Not when i can watch this talented man and his swinging orch estra."
3,Horrid Mix!,"I don't know what the other two reviewers heard or saw in this DVD but as far as I'm concerned it's not worth the money. The video is film, and not top quality film at that. Not tape. The sound is mixed in such a way that at times you can hardly hear the orchestra or Brians background singers.If you love good sound and video, and have seen this orchestra preform in person as I have, you wonder how such great sound and video can be lost in a DVD transfer. The answer is in the end credits. The ENTIRE production was done in Japan. Sound, Film, Director, Entire production staff, Remote Facilities, Lighting, Everything.When the DVD was over I came away feeling like I had just seen a Godzilla movie and I didn't know why until I saw the end credits. And I get a kick out of Godzilla movies. I just don't want a concert to sound or look like one.Nuff said. Don't waist your money on this one. HOWEVER If the Brian Setzer Orchestra comes to your town, GO!"
2,Slower Setzer,"Brian Setzer, former Stray Cats frontman, and current big-band revivalist showcases his orchestra for his much-loved Japanese audience. While Setzer and his troupe sound well instrumentally, time has obviously not been kind to Mr. Setzer vocally or physically. He is visably heavier than we remember him at the time Jump, Jive and Wail was a regular feature in the Top 40, and has grown caricature like sidburns that put Elvis to shame. He is also developing jowls a-la Richard Nixon. Additionally, Setzer has obviously been on tour for a while before this performance was taped and his vocals pay the price. Final analysis, Setzer is still fun to listen to overall, but not fun to watch. His performance is nothing visually gripping and his full sleeve tattoos are beginning to sag. If you have to have a Live BSO product, pick-up the import only cd companion to this dvd."
4,Brian Setzer Live In Japan,I just received this DVD as a gift. Having seen BSO live 3 times over the past few years it is a great production of what his shows are all about. Fun Fun Fun! Love the rockabilly and a few of the songs he never performed live when I saw him. A must for all BSO fans. One shortfall is the multiple angle feature does not work for some reason. Thinking it was a flaw in the disk I got it replaced and that one does not work either. I'm at a loss for understanding this and I wonder if anyone else has experienced this? Rock on!
2,Not if color matters!,"I ordered these last year and was pleased. But we needed to replace them (our own fault) and so ordered again. Yuck! If your Callaway colors matter to you, you are not gauranteed a match. This 2nd set is more of a lime green and does not look good in my kitchen at all. Guess that is what we get for outsourcing everything to workers overseas, eh?!"
3,economy is right,for the price they are good. They matched my other Callaway stuff. Burner covers are not for me. I no longer use them after burning one.
5,Teachers Note!,"This is a wonderful book. Vold's sojourn to meet and capture the wisdom of these ""true originals"" is SO much fun, so illuminating. EVERY Teacher (of any subject) would not only enjoy this book, but would derive ""tips"" -- more like insights -- adaptable to any student. And there's a philosophical component that's heroic. Like a book full of Babe Didriksons or Amelia Earharts or Kate Hepburns... What a way to start the Golf Season!"
5,Hunh?,"I think the ""reviewer"" from Albany, CA has some kind of personal vendetta, or something -- this book, as we already said in previous review is a wonderful celebration of the early women golfers. We don't ""get"" Albany, Ca's criticism."
1,Boring and Self-centered,"Overly subjective and self-centered. Vold says she wanted to capture ""the wisdom"" of the great women golfers but what she's achieved here is a loving (and boring) portrait of herself. I love the game, I don't appreciate this kind of intellectualism."
1,Not true,Your prices are not true - says $163 for Georgia G9382 boots and cheapest is over $250. I seem to find this with a number of boots that I am looking for. They sound like good buys then when you open them the prices aren't the same.
4,A Timeless Classic But Not One Of My Favorites,"When I received this cologne I was shocked that the bottle had no labeling on it at all. I thought it must be a knock off trying to pass for Halston. I used to wear this cologne sometimes when I was younger and going out to the clubs, and I don't remember it being an unlabeled bottle. However, I recognized the scent when I put it on, plus all the photos of it on Amazon that show the bottle have no labeling on them either. Personally I feel that it suits a more mature gentleman and, looking back I remember the store clerk at Macy's saying that the first time I bought it."
1,if there was less than 1 star I would rate it less,it smells awful.It is just like this : [...] which we use back in my country to get rid of any strong smells from hand after working on oily or greasy things ... it is like 1$ for the bottle
1,halston1-12,"This cologne is absolutely not what i expected, the company that shipped it is not the problem, its the cologne itself it smells like my grandpa, do not waste money on this cologne unless your like over 50!!!"
1,a big NO NO,a big NO NO for this product...this left stains on my new white shirt...hate it and i dont recommend it
3,Old Man?,It smells like somthing my grandpa would wear so I ended up giving it to him. He was rather pleased by it. Youngsters please dont buy!!
2,This smells like dirt,The title pretty much says it all. I regret getting it. Maybe it's just not for me though...
3,Wakkk...,"This Doesn't Smells As I Though, I Would Not Recommend This At All, Dont Waste Your Money..."
1,Smelled Like Old Stock...Not What Fresh 1-12 Should Smell Like,"I used to use this cologne years ago. I saw it on Amazon for a great price with free shipping (Prime) and ordered it. When I got it, and first sprayed it on myself, I couldn't believe it was the same cologne. It smelled like older stock that had been sitting around for awhile. Returning it tomorrow."
2,halston cologne,"I did not know how the smell was before buying, so I just wanted to give a try. Well, the price is good, the box is nice only the smell is old fashion. I did not return it, but I am using it as odor at house sometimes."
4,"Smells great, but don't last long","My fiance loves this smell. Everything I get near her, she keeps telling me how great I smell :) The only problem with this cologne is that it don't last long at all. I like i&#8203;t, but I wish it last long, you get what you pay for."
5,PRICE PRICE PRICE,8 dollars what more can I say. This is a great splash on and a cheap one to boot.......So I bought it.
5,Nice for winter.,"Love this stuff, and always get compliments on it. Just dont be 'that guy' who poors the whole bottle on. Two sprays and you are good to go."
3,Not Like I Remember,"Another of my 80s cologne re-stock. I remember this as being more rich and musky (but might be confusing it with Z-14). This one is okay, but not something I am rushing out to wear too often.It is masculine and rich but not all that memorable after all."
5,great price for a great fragrance,I just wanted to try this one and it is really good.so much better than other deals I used to get in WalmartI strongly recommend it ! thanks Amazon!
3,Not bad,"The scent a bit strong for my liking. Though pleasant, too strong. I mist the air and walk under it...just enough for me without causing people to walk on the other side of the room.Certainly a great deal for the money and the size of the bottle."
3,Nice Cologne,"I had never heard of 112. While ordering Halston's Catalyst cologne, I saw this and took a chance. The fragrance is powerful but long lasting and you can't beat the price. I'm glad I took the chance. It was received timely and in the advertised condition."
3,as described,"You know your child wants these wings, he or she will play with them until they are shredded, and they come as described. The value is fine. Go ahead and order 'em."
3,"Great story, poor translation","A fantastic real story narrated with captivating simplicity. Unfortunately the translation often adds in an attempt, it seems to me, to increase flourish, which instead corrupts the incredible personality of the writer (it is an autobiography!). The introduction is so long, it feels longer that the book and full of useless personal opinions."
4,Zebras,Great book! It has valuable information and tells you everything you need to know if you are a starter. I learned a lot of helpful things from the book.
5,great value,"I needed help with raising finches, I unexpectedly had eggs laid from my finches and did not know what to do so I looked on Amazon and found a zebra finch book for 1 cent!!!!!!!!That is right one cent, and the book was in excellent condition and helped me greatly. I would recommend Amazon to everyone...."
5,ZEBRA FINCHES COMPLETE OWNER'S MANUAL,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. THE JUST STARTING OUT BIRD RAISER AND THE EXPERIENCED BIRD RAISER WILL BOTH BENEFIT FROM THIS BOOK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. I WILL BE REFERRING TO IT OFTEN. TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT KEEPING AND RAISING ZEBRA FINCHES. THE BEST BOOK THAT I FOUND ABOUT ZEBRA FINCHES. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
1,Not easy to use.,No spring to use for the handle. Hard to use. Makes it hard to fix your hair Don't waste your money.
2,Barrel to Large,"Although the barrel is too large for my hair. I think this brand of curling irons is great.The company not so quick to be helpful on the rod sticking until a review was posted. Problem #1 when your return information isnt published where I am purchasing an item and I have to track down your company name and looking that way a quick response to a return request as sorry our returns are no longer accepted after 15 days, check with the manufacture it isnt really helpful. Then only after a bad review do you offer to assist me, I will not purchase from you again.Should really work on Customer Service the first time."
1,"Don't order this iron, esp from this vendor!","I was really excited about this iron, and couldn't have been more disappointed when I recieved it.It was SUPER cheapy (kids toys are made better!) and really awkard to use. I hated it and won't ever use it again.To make matters worse, this is a retailer outside of Amazon, so returning it would end up costing me about us much as I paid for it (re-stocking fee, shipping, you have to contact them and wait for a return number - yet you only have 15 days to contact them, recieve the number and ship it.....they CLEARLY want to make it impossible so you just wont- always a sign of a company with crappy products).Just say NO!"
2,Hard to use,"I bought the marcel handle thinking it'd lead to more ""professional"" curls. The handle is incredibly difficult to work with, as you can only use one hand to use it, and you can't touch the tip of the iron,. I severely burned my neck and I could only get it to curl the bottom bits of my hair. It was just a pain to try to use on yourself...you really need a spring action kind unless you're curling other peoples' hair. I kept undoing the curl I had just put in when I tried to get the iron out of my hair."
3,One sided,"Nice flag, but was surprized to find that this applique flag can only be seen correctly from one side. (The front)"
2,Horrible Purchase,"this tea appears to be regular orange pekoe( mid grade -to low grade tea), totally not worth the money.However the worst part about this tea is due to the plastic bags in which the tea is packed. Lipton apparently assumes that someone wants to drink plastic with their tea... I ended up cutting up the bags and using it as loos leaf tea.Lipton's other varieties taste slightly better, for example their Bavarian black forest variety, beware of the plastic bags though. -"
2,"Average taste, bad bags","For something as alluring as the ""black pearl"" name, I really didn't find much difference between this tea and the mass bulk lipton tea packs. I'd say the only difference is the size of the leaves, which are bigger for this tea.However, the bags for some reason are poor quality despite each bag having a much higher unit price compared to the bulk one. Three times I've had leaves leak out and go into my tea and I've noticed that there are leaves in the box from another ripped bag. Maybe I just got unlucky, but I like my tea leaf-free. I'd give it 3 stars for average taste, 1 star for bag quality, so it averages out to 2."
4,OK for an easy to find tea.,"Let me start by saying I do not find regular Lipton tea very good, kind of like the Budweiser of teas, average, inexpensive, and easy to find (two stars at best). I read a review of teas a while back, and Black Pearl got great reviews, so when it turned up on the grocer's shelf I had to try it. The flavor is OK, clean and fresh, not the bold flavor the reviewer gave it. While it is far better than regular Lipton tea, it is not anywhere close to the english tea that I prefer, Whittard English Breakfast. I was going to give it three stars because it lacked the bold flavor I was looking for. But taking into account the price and ability to obtain easily, I give it four stars."
4,lipton black pearl,"Good tea for a grocery store tea. Has a nice aroma and color. The color is golden reddish, which is very pretty. Easy to oversteep and make bitter, I didn't like it the first time I drank it, but the second time I just didn't brew it as long. I Think the mistake I made was trying to make it get dark, it doesn't get dark, just develops a richer color. I save caffinated teas for in the morning to drink instead of coffee sometimes, makes me feel more hydrated. I think it has plenty of flavor, but, then again I'm not crazy about really strong teas."
2,Acceptable tea,"This tea, while a step up from ordinary Lipton black tea, is NOT a gourmet tea. If you want to taste what a great black tea tastes like try Tevana's black pearl or one of the 4-5 star rated black teas on Teaspring.coms website. Great black tea is expensive, but it is worth it. By comparison, Lipton's black pearl is quite bland, and lacks depth of flavor."
3,Decent tea.,"Nothing special here, but it's decent black tea. Certainly not the best I've ever had - average quality, good price. Not as rich or strong as other black teas. Love the pyramid bags!"
1,disappointing,"I was excited to see a reasonably priced pyramid shaped teabag by Lipton. Previous experience with this concept in teabag design was very postitive, rich-tasting. This paricular product fell flat in the taste department. If it didn't turn the water brown, I'd swear there was no tea in it. Even two teabags in the cup failed to produce noticeable flavor. I'm doubling them up anyway now just to finish off the case."
4,"Good, for American tea","While Lipton seems to have borrowed the pyramid shape idea from PG Tips, they have improved on the concept of the triangular bag. This mesh bag allows for more water to pass through and for the tea drinker to observe the handsome, long leaves. Black Pearl's taste is strong by American standards and definitely the best thing Lipton has going. Tazo's Awake boasts a more distinctive flavour, but either choice is a pleasant surprise for the supermarket shelves."
3,Good tea,the tea in the bag is good. The bag that contains the tea is not good. The string that contains the tea has a string that they have laminated to the bag. When you try to pull the string from the bag no matter how careful you are with the string it tears the bag ( so there are tea leaves in the tea).
5,"as good as loose leaf: aromatic, smooth, delicious","This black pearl tea is incredibly good--it is bold but smooth, aromatic, and full-bodied. Similar in flavor to Earl Gray, this is a great traditional black tea with no unnecessary frills.I have a few other pyramid teas by Lipton, and while I would normally never drink ""bag tea"", especially not Lipton brand bag tea, their line of pyramid teas takes it to another level. They are aromatic and contain a larger leaf. The pyramid structure allows the ingredients to steep properly and expand, unlike the regular envelopes generally featuring crowded bits of lowest-quality powdery stuff. So far all the pyramid teas get five stars! Cheers!"
4,yum for your cup,The Tea is quite good and has a wonderful aroma. The unique pyramid shape of each bag only add to its elegant packaging. ..
5,excellent everyday tea,"This is a most excellent everyday tea. From a fine full bodied iced tea in the warm/hot summer months to a soul warming tea in the winter, this is an excellent tea. I enjoy it in the afternoons during a tea break when I can collect my thoughts and relax a while. Not at all bitter and full of flavour and strong enough to please even my taste."
4,Nice table,"Very easy to set up and does not take much space when folded. Not for very heavy objects, however."
4,"Nice, but nothing like the picture",The top of the table looks nothing like the pictures. It comes in a single roll with slats that run sideways (short direction) across the the table and roll out along the whole length. The end slats clip on at the corners to the frame so you can pick it up by the ends.It came in two pieces (not 6 as shown in the images here) - frame and single roll of slats. There are no black plastic corner things as shown.Otherwise seems like a sturdy and easy to assemble table. Very light for its size. Comes packed in an over-the-shoulder bag.
4,Good camping table!,Pros:SturdyCompactQuick assemblyEasy to cleanCons:End caps on slats fall out sometimes when assembling.This table is large enough for 4 people to sit at comfortably. I have mainly used it for placing food on when camping.
4,Tailgating helper,This has been just great for tailgating. We look forward to having it for camping season as well. Great price.
5,Great for kids,"My daughters (21 and 40 months old) love their ""muesli porridge"". It has no added sugar, takes five minute to prepare and tastes great."
3,"Great, if you LOVE sunflower seeds!","I am impressed by the overall quality of the ingredients that go into this product. Very healthy, and I prefer to eat it without soaking as recommended. However, there are an overwhelming amount of sunflower seeds, so much that they overwhelm all the other great ingredients. I know it is an inexpensive filler and prices are skyrocketing, but after a few days, it gets really boring to eat when it tastes like nothing but sunflower seeds, bite after bite."
3,TWO OUT OF 3 AINT THAT BAD,"THIS TAPE GRTS DRAGGED DOWN TO A 6 DUE TO THE SECOND STORY, HALFWAY HORRIBLE. IT IS AWFUL, AND ALSO THE WORSE EPISODE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, IT IS INCREDIBLY BORING. THE FIRST EPISODE, WELL COOKED HAMS IS ALLRIGHT. THE THIRD EPISODE, EASIL KILL YA IS GREAT. AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE BY TIM ROTH IN THE THIRD ONE. WATCH THE FIRST, AND THEN FAST FORWARD TO THE THIRD, TRUST ME. END"
5,Great,This is my first large mixer and I love it! It works great. The item looks about 99% brand new!
4,Wrong Item,"Beware, this is not the Professional 5 Plus as listed, it is the Professional HD. Also, I should read ALL the reviews."
4,Kicks it all off,"This is the novelization of the first episode of Doctor Who. The Doctor has lots of help in this one, his grand daughter Susan and two of her teachers, Ian and Barbara.Ian and Barbara refuse to believe that the Doctor can travel through time, so he takes them into the past where they meet up with a tribe of cavemen. The tribe has lost the ability to make fire and the Doctor must decide whether to give it back to them. To make matters a bit more confusing there are two warriors jockeying for leadership of the tribe, so the Doctor needs to decide who to present it to. Oh, and of course everyone is threatening to kill the Doctor and his companions if they do not do what they are told.The Doctor is not as forceful in this story as in later ones, at times Ian leads the group, although eventually the Doctor always ends up back in command. A quick story and for once the Doctor does not have to save the world, just himself and his companions."
4,In the Beginning...,"Not a bad beginning. Although pretty basic, compared to some of the later stories, this one will be interesting and necessary for any Doctor Who fan. We're first introduced to our mysterious hero--a mysteriousness lost in the later books. It's interesting to see how this character has developed over the years. Again, not exactly a page turner, but a must-have for any Doctor Who fan."
1,Very bad,"I actually like B movies, but the problem is, this one is so horrible, it makes me sick. Usually B movies are entertaining in their own way, but this one just churns your stomach and makes your head hurt. Bad acting, bad story, and it isn't even ""funny"" bad, like some B movies are. Avoid at all cost."
2,Magnificently Terrible,"Pure comic genius. DVD was packed with terrible moments that strike fear into and shame into anyone who sat thru this movie. This movie gives hope to any up and coming film producers; anyone can make anything, and everyone will buy it."
5,zakk wylde wah pedal,"Not only does Zakk himself use this pedal on stage but he also uses it to record and you can hear it on any of his albums. This pedal is everything that you would expect it to be, it has a very deep muddy bottom tone and then when you rock it forward the high end of the pedal screams with precision clear tones. The range from bottom to top is very broad so you can get a wide variety of tones from this pedal. I would recommend it for anyone who likes a good wah pedal."
5,"RX-7, the book by Brian Long","Great book, all of the history is there. Worth geting, also makes a cool table book. lots of pics, and info on the Wankle rotary. only thing is it lacks a longer buyers guide. oh well, still A+."
4,Small but Pretty,I love this ring. I bought it for myself for Christmas last year and absolutely love it. I was disappointed in how small it was but I should have expected it because it is only 1/4 cttw.
4,"14k White Gold Round 3-Stone Diamond Ring (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity), Size 7","The 14k White Gold Round 3-Stone Diamond Ring (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity), Size 7 looks really good and looks like a very solid contruction, fits very well, a very good product for the price. The only issue is that it not came with a diamond certification. Thank You..."
4,Its ok....,"It is fine if you have hair that is mildly straight already, but i have wicked thick, curly hair, and its not as thin as i want it. It looks straight, but its not thin."
1,They don't last!,These don't last long. My daughter has had to buy three in a year due to failure of the heating elements. Clearly a design flaw.
1,Weak hair straightener..,"This straightener is horrible. It doesn't heat up enough even on the highest setting (freakin' 25!), which makes straightening hair VERY difficult. Such a disappointment, since it was super pricey. (I got it on a whim at Target.)"
3,Ok for the money,They were ok for the money ... i've now bought GHD flat irons ... at 10 times the price but amazing results !!
1,Horrible for thick wavy hair,"This flat iron is crap. I have thick hair, it's currently the only flat iron I have, and it takes several swipes to get it moderately straight. I've never gotten it actually flat with this iron, just ""styled"" I guess. It does well for now, since I have nothing else, but seriously DONT BUY THIS!!!"
1,Terrible,"I am really disappointed with this iron (and the smaller travel one). My hair's only a little wavy and responds well to most irons and products. However, for whatever reason, this iron makes my hair feel very rough and it just doesn't seem to work. It's billed as being ""ceramic"" but the plates are low-quality. I am pretty sure it's damaging my hair and I regret trying to save money with this crappy iron!! Don't buy!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"It is a very poorly made product and does not deliever. The plates are not real ceramic and after a few uses the ""ceramic"" coating starts to peel off. It does not distribute heat evenly and actually ends up burning your hair. Please do your self a favor and just pay extra money to get a good quality flat iron. I know that the chi might be a little over priced but it works way better than this."
4,Revlon,It is a good product but use it minimal else it will damage hair if u use it on a daily basis
2,Hard to use,I found it very hard to useThe temp is either too high or too lowdoes not serve the purpose of hair straightening
4,Wonderful,"Love this straightener - it lightly curls the ends of my hair under while straightening the rest...This was a replacement for another one, however. The heating element fried out in the first one... about a year after I bought it. Seemed a little soon, considering the price. Had that not happened - I'd give this product 5 stars."
1,DITTO,"A TOTAL piece of junk! I had same problem previously described. The spiquot has been nearly frozen since installing it. It has a single nut that holds the entire body to the sink, that constantly loosens and backs off because of the effort used to move the spiquot. I contacted Moen and all they did was send me a repair kit of various parts, but not for my specific issue, and no instructions. OBVIOUSLY, they've known of this design flaw and have chosen to do nothing more about it. After seeing that others had the same problem, it wouldn't appear worth the time and effort to rebuild the faucet."
4,interesting,i found the brief background of the german artist to be an interesting read. i liked his acoustic guitar playing in every song.
1,Literally burned my hair off,"I was given this product as a gift. I have been drying my hair for 20 years and know how to operate a hair dryer. I used this on the low setting and still it became so hot, I was not able to change the hair brush attachment without wrapping it in a towel. When I was finished drying my hair I looked in the mirror and realized it had burned off a good section (about 1 inch by 1 inch) of my hair in the back of my head. I was left with little stubbles of hair. I called revlon and was advised that they don't manufacture this hair dryer, the company Helen of Troy does and they use the Revlon name. If using this product be careful! I don't want anyone else to lose their hair. I'm only giving this product one star because I can't give it no stars."
1,CAUTION: BURNT HAIR,"Bought this dryer at a local drugstore. Loved it because it dries very quickly into a smooth, slightly curled style. Have always been a bit wary of it tho, because it gets very very hot...too hot to touch. But I dealt with that because I like the way my hair turns out with it. BUT THEN, today when I was drying my hair as I always do, I smelled burning hair. I looked down to see that the section of hair that I was drying had burnt off and fallen to the floor!!!! It was about 4 inches long. Just a small section in my longish hair, at the nape of my neck, but WOW. I threw the dryer right into the garbage. BUYER BEWARE!"
2,Hot Air Dryer,"This product has the power I need to do the job. Have tried some with fewer watts, and they don't do the job at all.I can even use this as a hairdryer, so there are fewer appliances to worry about.My only complaint is that the off/on slider switch is hard to move, hard to get a grip on it. The notches should be larger.I could not find it in my local stores, so was so happy to see it on Amazon, at a good price.I would buy it again."
1,Missing Refund,"ok, i ordered this product and never once received it, so i wanted a refund but never once got it back. so disappointed, this product would be rated a 5 because i used to have this product when i was back in high school but the expeirence i could do without!"
1,[Non-] sliding button makes RV440 unusable,"If only I could operate the button, I could make my hair look really good with the RV440. The barrel is nice and fat, and the bristles hold the hair just enough without tangling. For a few seconds I could see the potential for fat, smooth waves.But the sliding button is just too hard to slide. The button has four settings: OFF-COOL-LOW-HIGH. It's just possible to slide it from OFF to HIGH, but not HIGH to OFF, or any setting in between. And it gets too hot on HIGH.My first and last time to use it, I had done a section of hair on HIGH for about three seconds and it got so hot it was burning my scalp. Unable to slide the button away from HIGH, I had to hurriedly unplug the cord.What a shame to put such a POORLY DESIGNED BUTTON on an otherwise good styler. In all fairness, the unusable button and too-high heat on HIGH were the only problems I had. I did not have the other problems that other 1-star reviews cited."
5,Couldn't Live Without It,"This product is seriously the best thing I ever bought for my hair. I have extremely thick, curly, unmanageable hair. This product helps tame my unmanageable hair and makes it look soft, smooth, and healthy. I like how it is a brush and dryer combined- no trying to juggle the round brush and separate hair dryer, and I can do it with one hand.The only gripe I have with it is I can't figure out how to clean the barrel. Styling products tend to build up on the metal part, and it is kinda hard to clean since I don't think you can immerse it. But other than that, it's a great product and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone."
2,Works well...until it doesn't...,"I have had this brush dryer for about 4 months. I loved the way it dried and styled my hair. The end of the brush remains cool enough to touch, which makes styling easier for me. However, this week, the barrel stopped sticking into the base--both barrels... Now, as I try to run the brush through my hair, it begins to come away from the base, which makes the whole process problematic. I don't know whether my air styler is one flawed product out of a million, but, disappointingly, it has ceased to work well for me."
1,Broken after 3 uses,I have literally used this three times and the hot air is now broken. It blows cool air just fine but really? I have thick hair and I always dry my hair before using the styler so there is no excuses for this crappy product. Don't waste your money.
2,Good styling with extremely bad quality,"This type of brush works best for me to have smooth straight hair. But the quality of the product is worse than ever expected- it falls apart before even me touching it: the plastic tip on the brush would not hold at all And the brush hardly stays in its place while I dry my hair: I have to hold it from the plastic tip by my other hand so that it does not fall down, and every minute I have to bend down to the floor in order to pick up the plastic tip. It has to be there, otherwise the brush is too hot to touch. My first same item broke quickly, so I have been using this one for about a year. I and get nervous each time I have to use it. Unfortunately there are no many alternative products with the same brush. I hope I find a better brand some day (currently looking)."
4,Worked EXCELLENT for one year until it literally went on fire,Worked absolutely great with my frizzy hair. Creates volume and waves. Very easy to use for great results. Can't be used on the highest level because it overheats easily. It created light smoke one time when I used it for too long - my fire alarm went off. I kept using it on low for almost another year but eventually all the dust got caught in the back which can't be cleaned and a flame shot out.I love this hairdryer but it has to be replaced after a few months otherwise it can be dangerous.
1,Revlon Styler - too flimsy!,It is too flimsy! the smaller styler falls of the holder all the time. It styles well but i am sure it will not last a long time.I had a Conair one for years and it much better made. I do not recommend it<...>
5,Great Hair Dryer for Persons with Osteoarthritis!,"Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, BlueThanks to this Revlon hair dryer, I can blow dry my hair again. I have Osteoarthritis and cannot hold a regular hair dryer. It was easy to use and did a terrific job of drying my thick hair. Before my hair was completely dry, I added the smaller brush to style/smooth my hair. My hair looked great! This is a great hair dryer for everyone--disabled or not! I am thrilled that I found this dryer on Amazon, my favorite place to shop."
2,Torture Device Disguised as Styling Tool,"This styler seemed great out of the package, and it works well at drying hair. However, it RIPS OUT MY HAIR! Where the metal brush and plastic end meet, my hair gets caught and torn out of my scalp! This is an obvious design flaw, and although I try my best to keep my hair out of the crevice, at least once each time I style my hair, it gets caught in the end and rips out of my head. It also gets caught where the metal brush meets the handle, but not as often as the crevice on the end. The last time I used it this happened four times, so I am returning it!!"
2,Can you hear me???,"First of all, let's talk about the noise level on this thing. YIKES! That should be against some kind of consumer protection law. The blowdryer part is ok, but didn't like the brushes at all. I'll go back to my Conair stying brush and my straightener.Live and learn."
3,Great appliance but very unreliable,"I have purchased at least 6 of the Revlon RV440C or equivalent Revlon products over the past 3 years and only one is working now. When I placed the order in April, I ordered two, and one has a short and will not run on fast fan, hot heat. Now I need to order another ""spare"" as I never know when it is going to fail. But as you can see, I can't live without this hot air dryer as it makes hair styling much easier. If only the Revlon company could improve the reliability."
3,Bad curling brush .,"Had curling brush for about a month , all ready giving trouble , cutting on and off ? Although it is being replaced , hope new one will last awhile ."
2,Revlon dryer styler,"I've bought this before and should have known this wouldn't last any longer, there would be no improvements. The top piece has already been popping off andthe attachment has already started falling off like my last one. It is such a good dryer for my hair to dry and style at the same time, but they don't last. I've only had this one a little over a month and it's already probably on numbered days. Wish they would pay attention to complaints and improve on the item."
1,Air Vents Under Brush Blow Hair into a Mess,"The vents under the brush attachments blow hot air out. It's no problem for the piece of hair you're trying to curl, but it messes up the sections of hair around it by blowing them around into a mess. It's hard to get a polished look when the hot air brush is making a mess out of all of the hair you just styled."
1,Too Hot!,I found this product to be inferior. This product was so loud that I resorted to wearing earplugs for the first few times I used it. Also the barrel was so hot that I couldn't use it. I would never suggest this anyone purchase this product.
2,Don't use on fine hair,"I was disappointed with this product. I have fine, frizzy hair that is slightly wavy, and have used these type of stylers to eliminate the frizz and perfectly straighten my hair. I've always had good luck with these in accomplishing silky smooth hair with just enough volume, but this one was terrible. I think there was just way too much air power, as it only blew my hair around as I was trying to use the brush. In the end my hair was still frizzy, without the shine, and had WAY too much volume. Maybe it works better for those with really thick hair, but I don't recommend this for anyone who has fine, frizzy hair."
1,Overheater,"The first day I used this brand new dryer, it overheated after 5 minutes and never turned back on. Blow in it to cool it down? Forget it! I'd hyperventilate trying to cool it off enough to use it again. It would be easier to grow an extra arm and be able to hold a regular dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other, and use the new hand to separate the sections."
4,Seems the best,"It works to straighten, and curl long wavy hair. It is hotter than other brands (conair), which is why I buy it But it does get VERY hot and has burned my skin. Also, the handle can feel a bit loose from the hot wand part."
2,overheats and gets too hot,"I have this brush dryer. I have been using brush dryers for 16 years and have owned several different brands and types. All tend to overheat and don't last as long as regular dryers, but this one is the worst one I have owned. It tends to over heat and just shut down. Then one cannot use it until it cools down. If you use it, turn it off and then try to use it again, it often won't turn back on. It is also often difficult to hold because it gets so hot. I have even smelled burning hair even though I clean it. If I take the brush off and use the ""dryer,"" my hair gets sucked into it. When I can use it, it styles beautifully though."
4,Useful,"Excellent product and it was delivered on time. So useful for me because it gives me the opportunity to blow dry my hear with style, not just being flat."
3,Doesn't work for me,"I really have problems blow drying my hair straight without getting frizz, so I decided to buy a hot air dryer. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for me. It's not difficult to hold or handle, but it makes my hair frizzier than a hair dryer. Back to the drawing board!"
3,This dryer is OK,"I have bought this for my wife.Pros are that the power is very good.Cons: the air is very hot even at lowest position, attachment is not that handy."
3,hair,"I got this to replace one just like it I had had for years that finally wore out. This one, however, I can't keep the brushes on long enough to even dry my bangs. Luckily I can use the dryer with an unattached styling brush to dry the rest of my hair. It was exactly what I wanted but doesn't work right."
1,Used To Be Good,"I had a previous version of this item (same brand, same style)that worked great for years. It finally died and I ordered this one. Two weeks after the return window expired, it stopped putting out heat completely. Now I'm out $23, sadly."
4,Reasonable price and does the job,"I have used many similar products and find the Revlon Ionic Hot Air Stylers are the most reasonably priced and still a good product. They last a long time and are easy to operate and are ""balanced well"", which is important. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the screws in the brush wands tend to work their way out over a period of time and that is a nuisance."
4,Revlon Styler,"As described and delivered fast. Has three heat settings and does what it's suppposed to do. This styler dries and smoothes my shortish and very fine hair quickly; doesn't add a lot of volume but does eliminate frizzies and makes it look shinier than usual. Even on low heat the barrel gets pretty hot, so I haven't needed to use the high heat setting. For more volume I still use my hair blower and a brush, but I'd recommend this product for people who don't want to spend a lot of time on their hair."
2,"Great Idea, but needs cool shot","I loved this product for the first few months. I only used it maybe 1-2 a week. It's so fast and easy, and my hair alwasys had a great shine. My issue was that it over heated very quickly and after only 5 months the thing started smoking after less than 1 min of use and broke for good! I love the idea of this air brush, but obviously needs a cooling factor and over all better quality."
2,Could Be Bad for Your Hearing,"I bought this at Target since it was on sale for $16.99. I bought this to replace the one I currently owned which was a Wahl brand that had overheated on me. Well, I opened it today and it worked ok. It dried my hair and styled it at the same time like it claims it will. The only thing is that it was so loud I had to wear ear plugs while I was using it. It sounded like a leaf blower blowing in my ears. It was, by far, the loudest blow dryer I have ever heard. On low, it was tolerable but it would have taken me an hour to dry my hair. I am going to return it tomorrow and look for another one. I would not recommend this is you value your hearing."
3,handle,i love the attachments but the handle is too short and your hand ends up on the air flow vents
3,great product for short time,Great product for as long as it lasted. part that holds brushes in place broke after only l month use
5,Yay Revlon,"I love this thing. I only buy Revlon products because I've come to realize that they're stronger than other brantds. I bought it for like $15 at Kmart. I had one before but this one is new and improved and seems more powerful than the other. Its cool because it dries your hair, straightens, and gives it flip or curl. My hair is hard to handle because I dye it and it looks really dry when I style it. With this thing, I use it and it takes me only like 20 minutes to dry, and style my hair. The first day I used it people were like ""You're hair is so nice today! What'd you do!?"" Use this product with a syrum and hair spray. Thats what I find works best :)"
1,Waste of money - overheats - even smokes!,"Avoid this product - it cannot be used for more than 3 minutes without overheating. I used mine twice - for about 3.5 minutes each time. This includes shutting the unit off and on to reposition it. The third day I used it, it started to smoke! It is a piece of junk made with poor quality parts."
1,Don't do it,"I bought this item at Target (same price) because I wanted to straighten and style my hair in the same step. Looked like a good buy, but wasn't. I returned it after getting super frustrated with the product quality. It doesn't have a cool-shot button, so it overheats every few seconds and quits....wait for it to cool and it turns on again, speed up the process by taking off the attachment and blowing into it....huge hastle. I never did get my hair all the way dry with this product. The product I swapped it for was a Conair double ionic port dryer, with a cool shot button, we'll see how it goes."
4,Different to what i thought,"I really thought the brushes were harder, that was a dissapointment, but in all it gets the job done. drys my hair well"
2,"Not sturdy, not very hot.","The rotating barrel doesn't lock in place - or slips and starts spinning without pressing the unlock button. Not very warm,takes quite a long time to get a strong curl on even dry hair. Fine for super-fast touch ups, but that's about it. Happy it was only $20, but I wish I hadn't bought it!"
3,dryer,"Its decent and does the job, but it does not have teh same punch as my original one. even though its the same model number i guess its the luck of the draw!"
3,Get what you pay for.,"This product does not last long, keep that in mind if you have past shoulder length hair. Worked well for a few weeks and eventually the bristles started to bend."
2,Not as easy as it looks,"The whole unit is really bulky and quite large. I tried it once and put it away. Maybe some day when I have a lot of time to mess with my hair, I'll take another stab at it. Kinda funny..I bought this to save me time."
2,superficial book for boat building,"I have recently read (and bought) few books about boatbuilding and desing and this book has been most fruitless so far. First of allit is VERY short for the topics it covers (only a bit over 200 very, very short pages) and hence none of the topics are discussed in detail. Anyone who is considering of building his/hers own boat will probably want to read all books of the subject, since there aren't too many.There is however much better books for this subject. From early 80's there is ""Fiberglass Boatbuilding For Amateurs"" By Ken Hankinson which is much more profound text of fiberglass boatbuilding. It is out of the print (I think) so you need to find it used.This book is only one that is in print and covers fb boat building in practice (at least only one that i know). So If you can't find Ken Hankinsons book, this works as poor substitute."
3,Lack of pictorial illustration,"Most of the process are described in writing. Lack of pictorial illustration make this book ineffective. Poor introduction causes disorientation in the first few chapters. Not recommended for beginners. Good facts book for apprentice and small scale boat building workshop with some basic knownledge. Lots of ""pointers"" and ""how to"" but not really clear enough to build a boat."
3,Allen Pistol Rug,"Merchandise was as advertised, delivered on time. On the basis of this one purchase, I'd say the vendor is honest and reliable.With shipping costs, it was rather pricey, but that's my own fault for not paying closer attention."
5,Provocative,"This book was to me, a real blessing! I am a Messianic Jewish minister, and have studied this way since 1989. If only the Church at Large would study as Jewish people do, they would come to know what the True Messiah of Israel is like. Over the centuries the Church has lost sight of it's Jewish Roots. This book, I believe could help a believer SEE God and His Messiah in all new Light.I was indeed suprised and most blessed by the Maureena and her understanding of God in light of the Hebrew AlephBet.Shalom, Rev. Barbara Di Gilio, Mayim Hayim Ministries"
1,Simply Gawd Awful,"This is truly one of the worst films I have EVER seen! Buyer beware!!!!! A complete whitewash of history. For anyone who doubts that hoover was anything other than a monster, just go on the FBI's own website and read some of the complete archived case files they have online (I especially recommend the COINTELPRO files). I mean...the character of Hoover (as played by Ernst) of all people griping about tabloids invading the privacy of citizens!?! LOL! This man was wiretapping everyone from Supreme Court Justices, to civil rights activists, to average citizens!"
3,Not what I expected,Not what I was expecting but well performed. Hoover was a meglamaniac and that didn't come through clearly enough hoever
1,Unexpected,"We were very surprised at the nature of this movie. It was a pair of monologues in the person of Hoover and an aide, defending his principles and reputation. I didn't expect either an expose or hagiography, but did hope for a biography or at least a study of a major event, a la ""Lincoln."""
2,hoover,I made an error reviewing the book thinking it was this product.This is a dry stage play that lost my attention within in minutes
1,GOD AWFUL WATE OF TIME & MONEY,WARNING: This is an older film not the recent one by DiCaprio. Borgnine is a piece of wood. He sounds like a grade school student reading aloud. Save your money. Get the one with Leonardo DiCaprio. Thats probably the one youre looking for.
1,Far Right Gushiness!,"I'm all for character studies and for older actors to have opportunity to practice their craft. However, hearing one boring speech after another was just a mind-numbing experience. Sometimes plays with few characters and close to no props can maintain one's interest, but that same sparseness doesn't necessarily translate into an engaging film.In the extras, the director and producer make it clear that they love them some Hoover. They don't want to view him as a flawed or hypocritical man. This work is a love fest for a figure who probably doesn't deserve one. Bill O'Reilly is in the extras: Nuff said!This is the direct opposite of Whitaker's Idi Amin or Mirren's Elizabeth II. This work was dull and irritating. I found it to have close to no merit."
1,Not Happy,I cannot offer a review because my son still has not received the bookI ordered as a gift. I have sent an e-mail to Amazon who in turn forwarded to the seller but have yet to hear anything.Diane RossI would have left it with one star but it wouldn't allow me to do that.Can't rate a book if you don't have it.
3,Good For Pilots,"As its title promises, Practical Aviation Law is well suited to airmen looking to expand their understanding of the regulatory framework governing private aviation. It can be invaluable for pilots who are looking for a better understanding of the rules they must follow to maintain their certification. The book is best suited to non-lawyers. Aviation attorneys will need a more detailed reference for use in advising clients in legal and tax matters aside from the FAA regulations."
3,Practical Aviation Law,The book was very informative but not one that i would just go out and buy if I did not have to.
4,Excellent book!,"Although I find it sometimes a little too deep in the details, every chapter has a good overview of the technologies."
2,pictures too detailed,"The pictures in this coloring book were too detailed and small for the children (fourth graders) to enjoy coloring. However, it gave good exerpts with good information and facts underneath each picture."
1,This thing sucks but not in the way you want,This dustbuster makes me wonder how the company still sells these things. It takes FOREVER to charge and lasts all of about 3 minutes. Don't bother buying it if you want something that Actually works.
2,Blows the dust right in your face,"This dustbuster has a really annoying design flaw. The ""exhaust"" vent throws the air right in your face. Since the filter used is very simple (a sponge) if you vacuum medium dusted surfaces, some of that dust does in fact come out through the rear and is blown right into your eyes.Other than that, it does vacuum ok and is easy to clean but I would choose another one."
1,Not even worthy of one star,"I had this vacuum for a year of frustration and annoyance. It does not work well at all. I finally brought myself to throw it away. I agree with the other review that it is a dustblower, I experienced getting stuff in my eyes as well. Did manufacturers use to make decent products for reasonable prices or am I just getting old?"
4,great little vac,"i've had mine for a few months with no problem. for under $20, i don't think you can beat the value!"
1,DustBlower,All it does is take the dust from the floor and blow it straight into my eyes from the side vents in the unit. Its more of a torture to use it. It's a pain to clean out because all the debris that did manage to stay in the thing gets stuck to the foam piece in the dust bucket. Honestly a broom and pan is easier and less painfull.
1,Batteries die too quickly.,"I think we've had ours for five months or so. The batteries are so weak now that it'll barely pick up anything. I opened up the casing and it looks like it only has one rechargable battery...about the size of a single ""C"" battery. This wouldn't be so bad if you could maybe order a replacement battery, but this isn't an option, so whenever this dies you have to buy a whole new one. Great marketing by B & D, but very bad for our polluted planet."
1,blows dusty air right into your eyes,"I agree with the other users. The air that is discharged from the side vents goes straight into your eyes and nose. I have hard contacts so all of the small particles ended up between my eyes and my contacts and since I have allergies, my nose was all stuffed up after I used it. Finally, the dust ball in the back of my throat is really not a pleasant feeling either ..."
5,Very handy vacuum,"I have two of these vacuums, thats how much I love it! It's so much easier to use this handy little vacuum in corners, hard to reach areas, & for cleaning up the seats & floors in your vehicle. Easy to use, store, and charges quick."
1,Should have read the reviews!,This is a one stick dipper - not the product in the advertised picture. I was very surpised when I opened the package. Cute - but not what I thought was coming :(
1,Ehhh,I thought I was getting the cute little beehive and stick. All it was was one dipper. I'm confused and the advertisement is misleading. Unless the rest of the product is coming in later I'm a little upset.
1,Book offers nothing new,This book is more like a distillation of all the various magazine articles and interviews with Ralf Hutter over the last 25 years. If you are a Kraftwerk fan there is nothing new in here. The book by ex-drummer Wolfgang Flur has more dirt and juicy tidbits. This is a real hack piece of writing.
2,Not good,The good news is that this battery fits and works with the PSP. The bad news is that it lasts about half the time of the original battery. I bought it as an extra for a flight to London and it lasted about 2.5 hours.
3,My Sony Battery experience,"I do trust third parties for new games, as every game I have ordered from Amazon, Walmart, and Gamestop so far, have been 100% legit. There are some things I will not buy used, or will not buy from a third party. One of them being a battery. I do trust newegg with their products, and have not had problems with my Lexar 32GB Memory Stick Pro Duo card. My ""$40"" 2200mHZ battery is great, a bit over 14 hours of play in the darkest setting, a bit over 10 hours at the brightest setting(I'm looking at 10:15 with a 95% battery) and I have gone an entire day without having to charge the battery. Just get the sony battery."
5,good bidness,Every thing worked out fine gygyhh hjhghggh ghgfggghhh hhgghgfhh hhhhggggh hgghgfh hhhvhhgg hghgvhvhhcg hfhffggfvjffjvfhh GH gu ghu hh hh hhu guuibhij guy hhu vcg ghhh ghuh ghubj gugh hgghhu hugghhgg ghgrfhgt ghhhgbgg fugghhg ggvgghhh
1,DON'T BUY IT,"I am very frustrated with this purchase. The new battery DOES NOT WORK with the new PSP Slim (also known as PSP-2000). I've tried with at least 4 diff. PSPs Slim, no success. According the seller it would work, but it didn't. Besides,even using PSP-1000,it worked lesser than the standard battery. Another point: it is a little smaller than the standard one;if you shake your PSP it may turn off. I totally discourage this purchase."
1,Junk for PSP Slim,"Don't buy this from amazon, especially if you have a PSP slim. The other reviews are right. If you get the battery with the Japanese writing it will charge in your PSP but do nothing else. At least this is my experience."
2,Low on power.,"This product arrived very quickly but after an initial charge of about 8-10 hours, the battery only lasted about 20 minutes. Really unfortunate, but the price was accurate."
5,Wish I had had this before beginning Spiritual Direction,"This is the book I wish I had before I began Spiritual Direction. I recall being abble to ask only the most general questions. I had read a number of books about Spiritual Direction (I prefer Spiritual Companionship) but had read nothing of the nature of the actual interactive relationship. The chapter on What to expect from SD I found very helpful in retrospect. The issues around dual relationships (pastor/director) etc is well addressed and the book contains the codes of ethics of the two major organizations of SD's. I highly recommend this to anyone considering spiritual direction or already in it, or considering becoming a director."
3,Not quite what I was expecting,We had purchased another of the author's books (which is one of my son's favorites) and this was not quite the same. Definitely not appropriate for a two year old - at least ours. Lots of interesting activities for the slightly older crowd in my opinion. We tried looking through it once with my son but he was not interested. We'll try again later as he develops more reasoning skills.
4,"Great ""Unknown"" Album","Well this is the first album from Goodbye July (Paul Rjinders from Anything Box) and sounds amazing!. All the songs are really good, but my favorite is ""Salvation"". If you like synth or electro pop stuff, this is a great listening choice!"
5,Dub,"If your looking for dub get this, make sure its the 2 disc then your getting it all. I personally havent heard much of these dubs on anything else making this a one of a kind dub album. No b.s. all dub. Buy It cheap folks dont get scammed by these inflated prices on reggae music."
5,Hands For Healing-hearts for Love,"As healers we often forget to look at the best tools we have been given, our hands. ""Hands of Life:Use your Body's Own Energy Medicine for Healing, Recovery and Transformation"", reminds us of the blessing of touch. Reflective as well as informational this is a great book to give for a graduate going into the healing or teaching profession. We find ourselves starving for love and affection in our daily lives. Ms. Motz teaches that in this world where touch is seen more and more as invasive and suspicious, we can use the healer in us all to affect this attitude. We can teach others that touch is another form of nutrition that feeds the spiritual heart as well as the physical body. If you are looking for the best book on the subject of hands on healing, this is it."
5,"Encouraging, inspiring, uplifting and hopeful!","This revolutionary take on the healing arts is so fundamentally sound that I found myself wondering why no one had thought and said these things before! Julie's experiences and descriptions of how she helps her patients process their surgeries and illnesses and GROW through them are truly inspirational. Our bodies want to know and understand our choices, and Julie does the obvious: talking to the individual organs and helping her patients truly inhabit their own bodies. This book is SO well-written and moving - You may not agree with every hypothesis she presents, but you will definitely FEEL happy to be human as a result of reading this book!"
2,Not what I expected,"We thought this book was about spiritual self-healing, but it wasn't what we wanted."
4,good portable storage without jewel cases,"i've been looking for something like this for a while--that is a reasonable way to store cds and dvds safely without clunky and often broken jewel cases. this hanging ""file folder"" type setup is great. i would only recommend this product for the sleeves it uses, as you can easily fingd something cheaper to hold cds in cases. the sleeves are designed to hold 2 discs apiece, but they work great using 1 side to hold the insert booklet and the other to hold the disc and tray liner. there is even a spot at the top of the sleeve whichich holds the spine label perfectly. order more sleeves for s&h; cost only at www.atlanta-inc.com/promotionsuse code asd0206hfs"
2,.,"I knew things weren't going well when I got to a ""The End"" and I thought, ""I'm okay with that.""Doing an adult version of a choose-your-own-adventure is a great idea but in the end it was more fun to appreciate as a concept than to actually read. The story itself was a little flat but the worst part was that the few choices you were given were just linear A or B decicions. I expected a lot more from the people involved.I might have found this more entertaining, though, if I hadn't read Super Giant Monster Time! by Jeff Burk first. It was too good. Get that book, not this one."
3,Ocean of Lard,"I love the Bizarro genre and I also loved the Choose Your Own Adventure books when I was young, so my expectations for this book may have been too high. Disgusting things in books don't bother me, but that's ALL that this book is. Instead of ""Mind-**** Fest,"" the subtitle should be ""Gross-Out Fest."" I also found the choices that the book offers pretty dull, like ""If you choose to go South, turn to...."" I was expecting bizarre choices like ""If you choose to do the Chicken Dance, turn to page...."" While the premise is creative and enticing I really didn't have as much fun with this one as I wanted to."
4,don't expect to make it back to shore with your mind in one piece,"(Ash Lomen)A Choose your own adventure book for adults. This one contains a runaway pederast, a Pirate hunting for feces, a sexy Frog-Girl (who puts out BTW), horrible endings, high adventure and of course... an ocean of Lard.Set Sail... but don't expect to make it back to shore with your mind in one piece."
2,Ech.,"You know, it's a cute gimmick and all, with the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" tie-in, but the writing just wasn't very good. It's something a 13-year-old may enjoy...lots of maggots and poop and pus. Other than that, there wasn't much to redeem it. Kudos for originality, but I was hoping for just a bit more substance."
3,brings me back,"a pitch-perfect homage to the Choose Your Own Adventure books, heay on sodomy, massacre, mayhem and other fruity flavors that Mellick and Co. bring to the table. fun bathroom reading."
3,car works but sucks up batteries!,"both car and remote need batteries which seem to only last a week or so. it's really, really loud but what should you expect, right? if you have no problem with spending lots for batteries, then it's a great working remote car."
1,It was ok...,This toy would have been fun if it would have worked when we got it. The switch on it was broken and on Christmas morning it was no fun for my boys since it didn't work. I didn't bother calling to complain/return it since I only paid 3 dollars for it. But since Amazon asked me my opinion I am giving it.
1,Stinky and thin,"I ordered a case of these diapers thinking that they were the same as the Swaddlers I was given at the hospital. As others have stated, they are not the same. They STINK of baby powder and are much thinner than the others I just ran out of. Neither the box nor the advertisement on amazon disclose that these are scented. I would not have ordered a case of 234 diapers had I known that they are artificially scented! Do not like. These are going back asap!"
5,Love them!,"I have to say that I really love these diapers. I was lucky to receive different brands of diapers as gifts, so I was able to compare the different brands. I loved these the most! Compared to Luvs and Huggies (Size 1), these are my top pick! Why? I love the wetness indicator! My daughter would cry and cry, and knowing I recently changed the diaper, it was one of the things I didn't think to immediately check. Not to mention the times when we would change her and would not be sure if the diaper was really wet! These took all of the guesswork out! Because of this feature I will definitely be buying more of these in addition to the ones I received as a gift. I also like the way these diapers fit."
5,Best of Both Worlds,"I used these with baby #1 in 2010. So glad they're still around. They have BOTH ubilical cord cut out, wetness indicator, and they have never leaked on me."
4,Pampers work great. No leaks,I have been using pampers since my son was born. They seem to fit the best and I rarely have issues with leaks. Be careful purchasing such a large box. They last a while and now my son is a little too big for them. I don't want to waste what I have left so I am going to try to use as many as I can.
5,Love'em!!,These diapers are the only diapers that don't give my long 7 month old irritation on her inner leg. The price is unbeatable and its DELIEVERED!! Its a win-win!
5,Pampers Swaddlers are the best Diapers,Pampers Swaddlers Diapers are my favorite diapers. They are soft and pliable and getting them through amazon mom subscribe and save is a great deal! I have four kids and have tried many different brands but these are my favorites by far!
4,waterproof,"My son used these diapers during his stay in the NICU. Since then I have tried several brands and by far my favorite has to be pampers swaddlers. Some diapers didn't hold ""everything"" and clean up time was a mess. Swaddlers prevent leaking of solids and liquids with less occurrences of a diaper rash."
1,Disappointing,"I am very disappointed with this product - these NB pampers are so small that even our baby boy, who is on the small side at about 6.5lbs right now, has been miserable in them. He does much better with a size 1 swaddlers pamper, folded down on the top so it doesn't go up to his chest. In the NB size, if you want to prevent leaks you have to tie the pamper so tight that the baby is squeezed to a dangerous extent. I don't see how they can label this as universally usable up to 10 lbs. Save your money and go straight for the size 1."
1,Gave my baby a bad diaper rash,"I had the same problem as Lindsay. My baby developed a very bad diaper rash due to the far from soft inner mesh of the size 2 diapers. What seemed unusual is that I had been using the new born and one sizes without any problem, so I tried contacting the manufacturer to see if they had reports of the same problem from other parents, but it was impossible. Recordings and spaces to leave an e-mail message of no more than 100 words was all I got. On top of bad quality, bad customer service? No, thanks. So I switched to Huggies Supreme Comfort Fit and we are all happy now."
1,Not as good as you would think,"Although these diapers have a great absorbent lining, the mesh that is used to make this lining sticks to the infant's bottom. With my son it cause red irritation. I had to discontinue these immediately... I switched to LUVS and highly recommend them."
3,Don't leak but they stink of perfume now.,We use swaddlers because we don't have any leaks with them. Both Huggies and Kirkland (Costco brand) are rougher and tend to leak very often. Unfortunately the latest ones I got from Amazon and Target store have a very strong perfume smell. They didn't before. Who wants the diapers to smell so much. I can smell it through the baby's clothes. I'm going to look for new brand without a scent now.
4,Watch rising prices...,"I've watched this product over the last few weeks steadily climb from $38.99 to $39.99 to now $41.99. Of course, the free 2 day shipping offer might be new as of the increase to $39.99.If I can get prices comparable to Walmart and not have to drive to the store then I'll buy from Amazon. However, these insidiously climbing prices make the offer less attractive and applies to Pampers wipes too!As far as the product goes, the diapers have worked well over the last 4 months."
1,Beware of size 1-2: No wetness indicator.,"Size 1 has wetness indicator, size 1-2 does not. It is important to have indicator. If baby is crying, indicator really helps.Double check your diapers before you buy."
3,Two different diapers,"I have ordered this twice in the newborn size and gotten what appear to be two different types of diapers each time.The first time I got packages that looked like what the hospital gave us and worked the same. They had a light scent and didn't stick to any of the baby.The second order came in different packaging and look and smell different. They have this mesh on the inside that sticks to my boy's parts and the smell is horribly strong and chemical-y.I would order these again if I could be assured that I'd get the same product as the first order of NB diapers, but I don't want to put out the money and simply hope that the diapers will be the non-stinky non-mesh ones."
1,Buyer beware,"I didn't think to check the reviews, because I didn't realize that by going to size three our beloved diapers would be anything but bigger than size two. Immediately out of the box the first thing I noted was the smell, which stays on the diapers even once out of the box. We will be trying to find a different diaper when these run out. Such a shame, because we really did love the swaddlers in the smaller (non-smelly) sizes."
3,pinching fasteners,"It's a great diaper, except I just don't like the fasteners. With all of my babies, I've wanted to use pampers for their softness, but always end up switching back to huggies for the fit. The fasteners on the pampers diapers leave red marks on my babies thighs. The tabs are made of plastic and pinch their upper legs. Since I just ordered a huge box, I am now cutting the tabs in 1/2, which helps some, but not totally. I wish I could combine the softness of the pampers diaper with the fasteners on the huggies diapers."
2,DO NOT BUY,"I was for 6 months with Pampers Swaddlers DRY MAX. They are amazing, we never have had any issues (leaking). Then, we changed to Pamper DRY and in the first night my baby wet all his bed. We immediately changed back to the DRY MAX. Do not waste your money on this one."
4,Good product for Infant baby and good price,"Good product for Infant baby and good price.If there is a qty available of more than 234pcs and is economical, i will definitely purchase the same."
1,Too much Rashes,"I have received two packs 70 + 70. First pack works good, But while using second pack My Baby got Rashes. I don't recommend this item at all."
4,Roomier and Less Leaks Than Pampers Baby Dry,I have used both Pampers Swaddlers and Baby Dry for my newborn. I have never had a leak with Swaddlers (with Baby Dry newborn liquid poop often shot right up the back of the diaper and onto baby's outfit) and the same size in the Swaddler style seems to be a lot roomier than the Baby Dry style. There is a slim indicator strip on the front of the diapers to indicate whether they are wet inside but to be honest by the time I have taken pants off or opened up the onesie to allow me to see the indicator I am already pretty much clear the diaper is wet. One complaint is that the top layer of the inside of the diaper has netting that wicks away moisture (to avoid leaks and keep baby's bottom dry) but also serves to dry poop bits which makes them stick to baby's butt. Cleaning takes more time because you aren't just wiping; you are also scrubbing dried poop bits.
5,The best!,These are the only diapers that prevent leaks! I've tried all the others and none fit as well and keep it all in as well.
4,sizes,My daughter is small for her age. She needs a size 18 mo pull up but the smallest is a size 2 which is too big and they droop
3,The tabs break,I used these for my daughter and loved them but recently the tabs have been breaking off so I switched brands.
3,Not my favorite choice- Huggies Snugglers work much better!,"We have tried both the Huggies snugglers and the Pampers Swaddlers. For us, I think the Huggies hold in what would be blow outs much better. Also, everytime I take a Pampers swaddler off of my daughter, the lining is sticking to her. That can't feel good to have something stuck to her all of the time when wet- plus it is more likely to give her diaper rash. The Huggies are so much softer on the inside and the lining has never ever stuck to her. Everyone is different but for us the Pampers Swaddlers just didn't work for us."
5,"No Doubt, the best we've tried.","All I can say is these diapers do not leak and absorb so much it makes everyone's life easier, including the baby's. Thumbs up!"
4,Overall great performing diapers,"Pampers Swaddlers is, overall, a great diaper. What I like most about it is the extra stretchy tabs around the waist, which allows me to adjust the diaper to my baby as he grows. Consequently, the diaper just firs better than other diapers. My only complaint is that it doesn't retain and absorb leaks as well as Pampers ""New Baby"" diapers, which is better designed for this specific purpose. I've noticed that I have to change his clothes more often when he really bombs! The ideal diaper (5 star rating) would safeguard leaks like NB and have these flexible tabs...."
2,Bad Price,We love the diapers and have used them with all of my three children. However... the price here is a little high. You can get the same size box at Babies R Us for $35 plus they send you $5 off coupons in the mail... plus you can still use a manufacture coupon.
2,Blow Out!!,"Every time my baby poops it runs out of he diaper, up his back! I was not expecting this from Pampers!"
4,great diaper buy,I bought the wrong size and they did not fit the baby. I would like to return them for a size 3. Is that possible??? I don't have 17 words to provide.
2,Size not good,Bigger than expected. Size N huggies fit better. Would that kill them to put a wetness indicator? The cord stuff does not really work and I have to bend it to make it off the cord.
1,Perfume so overwhelming they were unusable,Had used swaddlers in the past b/c I loved the wetness indicator. Bought this economy box and have no idea why but these have a very strong powder scented perfume that makes my eyes water and itch and my nose run when I am in the same room with them. I don't normally have allergies either. What a waste of $50
5,Great Diapers!,I love these diapers! So sad that my son finally grew out of them because Swaddlers doesn't make a size 4. I found these diapers to be very absorbent and comfy for my little guy. I highly recommend these!!
4,Good quality diapers and great fit for my baby,"We have used swaddlers since day 1 and are very satisfied. They've always been a great fit and hold almost everything in. My daughter (luckily for us) sleeps 11-12 hours at a time, so the diaper is often full in the morning. But no mess!Important to note: while we are very happy with Pampers, we've also had stages where they didn't always fit perfect - translation: multiple ""blowouts"". Other brands might fit better on your baby. No brands seemed to fit for a two week stretch in her 8th month.We've since moved onto baby dry and cruisers and are also happy."
5,VERY SATISFYING,"These pampers diapers have been the best brand and size for my baby. There has never been a time when my son appeared to be wet, I actually had to check twice before I could determine that it was time to change his diapers. It is no gimmic, these diapers actually keeps the wetness away from your baby's skin. I am a very satisfied mom. At 3 months and 13pounds, I know it is just a matter of time to move on to stage 2, but for now my baby is quite comfortable in his stage 1 pampers and I intend to continue using this brand until he no longer needs to wear pampers. Excellent product."
4,Pampers,This was a great buy. We love the swaddlers and the price was very comparable.....We are content on this purchase and will continue to purchase Swaddlers Pampers from Amazon.com.
3,Smaller size,This diaper is smaller compare to what is specified on the pack. We faced leak many times with my 5.7 lb girl
5,top of the top,"Pampers swaddlers...Yes, they are expensive but you will go through less of them as they are far more absorbent than any of the leading brands. I like to think of them being ""pharmaceutical grade"" while other brands are ""over the counter"". Our newborn son had a butt rash for over two weeks, and after switching to swaddlers, within 2 days it was almost completely gone. We attribute this to the dry weave found in the diaper. It really, really works. Sure, the high cost might be eating into his college fund, but if it means Mommy and Daddy get to sleep for more than 3 hours at a time, it's worth it. Plus, I'm sure this will pay off by not having to spend a small fortune at the plastic surgeon to remove premature aging from lack of sleep. Give 'em a shot. You won't be disappointed."
3,Good but stinky,"I've been using the size 3 on my 6 month old and haven't had a blow-out, yet. But the smell of these, a strong faux baby powder, has really turned me off and I'm cancelling my subscription."
1,Beware of the 1-2 diapers,"While I love Swaddlers, these 1-2 diapers are actually about an 1/8th of an inch SMALLER than the stage 1 diapers. And they do not have the yellow stripe. So if you are looking for something a little bigger than a stage one, then this is not it."
5,YAY! Pampers Swaddlers Size 3,"I love these diapers. So glad they made them a size larger. The Baby Dry breaks my son's butt out, I think the dye in the crotch area... These are so great for breastfed babies, keeps all the poop in with the netting LOL...I wish they made them up to size 6 hahaha :)"
1,DISAPPOINTED! STRONG PERFUME and GAVE MY SON HORRIBLE RASH!,"We've been using Swaddlers Size 1 from the hospital) and have been satisfied them. I thought we were ordering more of the same, but these are a totally different diaper, we are very disappointed, and will have to get rid of the rest of the value pack after using a few diapers. First, the diapers have an EXTREMELY strong artificial ""baby powder"" scent - it gives me a headache, scents the room. Second, these diapers gave my son a horrible rash with blisters since less than three days of using. I changed Pampers to another brand immediately and the rash and blisters begun to disappear. Either way, I will not be buying these diapers again and will at least be testing with smaller packages before buying in bulk."
3,not as good as huggies,it was the first time i bought this diapers. there are good but not as much as huggies...
3,"Good, but not great","Overall, I do not have a major problem with these diapers, however, I do not necessarily recommend them for breastfed babies. They contain the wetness really well, but don't really do the job with a #2. We often have to change our 3 month old son's clothes with this diaper because the mess leaked out the side or up the back. I prefer Huggies Little Snugglers because they feel more substantial and also have a little pocket on the back that holds the mess in."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased these diapers because we were given Pampers to use at the hospital. They seemed to work well and we really liked them so I was very excited when I found these in bulk and at a great price! Unfortunately, I found this particular diaper to be a real disappointment. I find that my son constantly leaks and with almost every diaper change he also needs an outfit change. And yes, the diaper fits him well so sizing isn't the issue. Additionally, when the diaper is wet there is a very strong chemical smell that in my opinion can be likened to that of fresh asphalt. On the plus side, the diaper is very soft and has a wetness indicator stripe which I found to be very convenient when you have a squirmy baby. Sadly, I will not be buying Pampers diapers in the future."
4,Excellent Product for babies,I absolutely love this pampers swaddlers. keeps our baby comfortable and swaddling helps more than the regular ones out there. i would recommend this to anyone with a new both and above. must have for all babies
4,Does the job,I'm still new at this mom stuff so I don't really know how much of a review this will be. We have been using pampers swaddlers since day one with our 2 month old. We have been pleased with this product and use the pampers sensitive wipes as well. The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is because of the blow outs. We have had multiple occasions where our child has blown out the sides or up the back. I plan on doing some experimenting with huggies just to see if I'm not missing something.
2,Newborn is great,Newborn and size 1 are great but they are not absorbent enough for a size 2 baby. Try the Baby Dry they are better.
2,very strong displeasing smell...,"I've been using Pampers Swaddlers since daughter was born at the hospital. For some reason, the ones used at the hospital (size 1), and the newborn size i purchased also from Amazon seem much better. This item also doesn't leak, and has the nice blue line when diaper gets wet, but it has a very strong overwhelming smell, both when diaper is clean and when it is wet - almost makes me gag. Wonder if it's only on the Pampers with the Sesame Street characters on the band???"
3,"We loved size 1-2, but at 3rd one we got a problems","Size 1 was best diapers ever, so we went further on with a brand. Especially since the price is very close. As we got to a size 2, 3. I'm not sure there is possibility that we had little problems here and there but not as much. Summer came and we got on #3, heat rashes came up, we always used Vaseline and other products to avoid it, nothing helped. All kinds of other rashes came up. There was even this huge pimple that was or a private spot. It's not because we didn't change it enough, but I came to find out that Pampers uses chloride for a smell purpose, and that was a reason she was getting bad rashes. As soon we switched it to different ones that don't have as much stuff in it, it all went away. We are going with Huggies now, even though they leak time to time. I prefer dealing with a leak rather than a terrifying rashes. I never leave bad reviews usually, but I had to worn you in case it happens to your baby!"
3,Defective and low quality diapers,"I bought pampers swaddlers because I thought these were premium diapers with the color changing strips but this latest batch has a bunch of leaky diapers. I have found my baby and her crib all wet because the diaper does not seem to absorb any liquid. I have come across many diapers in which the color changing strip does not change colors even when it is full. Either the quality of these diapers has gone down or I received a defective batch. Also, my baby never had diaper rash before; the diapers in this batch are giving her a diaper rash as well. I am going to be switching to other diapers after this batch is used up."
5,Great comfort!,Great comfort for my baby!!! Plus the amount for The price you pay is unbeatable!!!! Plus its Pampers!!! What else could u ask for ;)
5,Love Pampers,We have tried pretty much every diaper brand out there and we always end up going back to pampers. Love them!
3,Thinner than at Sams,I ordered this through Amazon. I had previously bought the same item at Sams Club. It was two dollars cheaper (though the sales taxes make up for that). The one thing that I noted was that the diapers from Amazon were slightly thinner than the ones from Sams. They are somewhat expensive.
4,They're fine.,"No little reward number codes, like the ones from the store. [[[EDIT 12/21/2012: I was incorrect! There are reward numbers on the inside of the individual packages!]]]Although size 1 diapers were getting small for my daughter, these seem quite large. She'll grow into them, I guess. We haven't had any leaks as a result of the odd sizing.These still have the yellow/blue stripe, and we like that.They have sesame street characters, a little older than the characters on the size 1 diapers."
4,diapers,how do you rate diapers? they work.. they keep the poop in... what more can I ask for. the sizing is a bit bigger than Huggies labeled the same size.
2,Did not expect it to be poor,"I have been buying pampers for the past couple of months since my baby was born. It was wonderful.But this time, this one was little different experience.We see that the latest pampers package that we ordered, the diapers are not retaining much as the earlier ones.We felt that it was a duplicate product that the vendor sold (We usually get it from Amazon.com Prime) but this time it was a different LLC vendor. Next time on wards, we will try to purchase only from Amazon.com to avoid disappointments like this time."
4,Great newborn diapers,"These are the diapers they used in the hospital for my baby so that piqued my interest. At first I was using Seventh Generation diapers at home, but had several leaks and bad diaper rash so switched to these. The diaper rash is still healing, but I have yet to have a leak with these. It has that extra netted layer that seems to keep baby drier than other diapers. I'm sticking with these as long as I can get them at a good price!"
2,Pampers Swaddlers Size1/2 234 pack,"Nice size, good for the money for pampers diapers, but just did not work well with my daughter. Does not have band around the back of the diaper so with my daughter the poop goes right up the back. I just use up and up at target which do great with her and my money."
2,No more stripe?,"We just purchased a box of these diapers and there is no longer a wet indicator stripe on the diaper, which is disappointing. Even worse is the scent; these diapers have an incredibly strong perfumed smell. We usually buy the Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive, which have a milder scent. The regular Swaddlers smell almost overwhelming and aside from not wanting to be near them, I definitely don't want them on my daughter with that much perfume!"
3,"Don't have the moisture sensor like the ""sensitive""","When I was deciding between regular and sensitive swaddlers, someone else in a review said that they both have the moisture sensor. These DO NOT. I bought the NB 84 pack, and they DO NOT have the sensor. Pretty disappointed.."
5,5 stars for Swaddlers and Amazon's delievry,"I would only use Swaddlers for my newborn - they are definitely the softest & most comfortable for him. I also received this item quickly from Amazon - order date of May 29, delivery on June 6!"
3,"great for newborns, but too pricey","These diapers are great for newborns. My daughter was small and no other newborn diapers would fit quite right. After she got up to about 9 or 10lbs we started using cheaper brands. We found that Luvs, Target brand, and Babiesrus supreme diapers are as good or better, and much cheaper. Bottomline pampers are great, but there are cheaper diapers that are just as good."
1,"The mesh lining sticked to my baby's buttom, which almost got her a diaper rash!",I had the same problem as Lindsay and R. M. Duenas. My baby almost had diaper rash by the mesh lining. I called CS and the lady didn't buy my story!! She just don't admit that this high end diaper caused my daughter's diaper rash!
5,pleasantly surprised,"I have been receiving these diapers via subscribe and save (Great deal, was better when it was 30% off though), and this last shipment came with Size 1-2 diapers in the Size 1 box. This was definitely not a problem for me though, because my son is almost a 2 and I bought these only because they are way cheaper than 2's. Pleasant surprise! From my experience though, there isn't really much of a difference between swaddlers size 1, 1-2, and 2. Especially when comparing to Pampers baby dry. My sister's son uses baby dry size 2 and they look the same size as swaddlers size 1!I do agree with a recent reviewer that there is a strange chemical-like smell when the diaper is full, but it's not a problem if you change your baby when he/she is wet!"
5,Just Awesome!,"The diapers were received quick, exactly what I had ordered and the box was not beat up at all. Just Awesome."
4,Swaddlers Sensitive is Better,"This is a great diaper, it's our second favorite behind the Swaddlers Sensitive. It doesn't have the color indicator, though at this size you should be able to easily tell when the diaper is wet. : The fit is comfortable for our little one, the elastic doesn't bind and we haven't had any allergic reactions or anything."
3,Still Prefer Huggies,"I started out with pampers from the hospital but when i got home i started using Huggies because those are what i got for my baby shower. I prefer the huggies because it was a fitted size for my daughter. The stretch part around the thigh and waist were snug enough to keep the poop inside. But with the pampers, it was not snug, the poop will come out EVERYTIME she poop. So, i used up the pampers and went back to the huggies"
5,I Go Back...,"I've tried the cheaper brands to save a buck and have to say no matter, I keep going back to these. They hold more and keep baby cleaner. A few less changes and a drier baby make up the difference in a few bucks."
5,Great diapers,I love pampers. Especially the wetness indicator. Makes it easy to peek in and see if his diaper is dirty without having to undress all the way.
4,Happy mom,"I've only ever used swaddlers and never had much issue. So the diapers delivered to the front door is quite the convenience and at a great price. This was suggested to me, and I will relay the great idea."
4,Swaddlers diapers,"Pretty much what I expected. A little stiffer than I thought it would be. Has the yellow stripe that turns blue when baby has peed, which is always a nice reminder. Though I probably go through more diapers because of it, but maybe less diaper rashes? Fits well, does the job."
5,Swaddlers softness,Great diapers. Love the softness of them. Even better having the size 1-2 for that transition of 1's being too small and not quite sure if we are ready to go to 2's. The box has lasted me the right amount of time and the price can't be beat!
5,Love Swadlers,"Wouldn't use any other diaper, not even cheep costco diaps! Have only used Swaddlers on my 2 boys and love them."
5,Couldn't be happier.,This is a good product and even better price. Wish I had found this with our first child. We only use Pampers brand. The savings was amazing. Shipping means no late nite trips to the store to restock. Signed up for Amazonmom.com for extra savings and faster shipping.
4,Great Delivery,Nice to have the diapers within a couple of days!! The diapers worked well when we had to grow from the Newborn ones. Still does it's job! Especially with the characters on it.
5,good item-good price,"Pampers swaddlers have always worked for my son. My son is 2.5 months old and has switched to Size 1 from new born. I haven't seen any leaks with these and the indication of whether diaper is wet or not is even more useful.Will buy again, when needed :)"
5,Have always used Pampers,I loved using the swaddlers when my baby was little and was thrilled when they made them in a larger size. I wish they still had them for size 4 as well.
4,Diapers are diapers?,"We just went with the same diapers that our hospital had used. This diaper has a ""wetness strip"" that allows you to know if the diaper is wet or not. This keeps you from unnecessarily from changing a perfectly good diaper. Diapers did well keeping the wetness where it belonged (inside the diaper). You just want to make sure you do not have too many diapers. Our child grew faster than we expected, so we had to cancel the ""subscription"" feature before the second box shipped (we had received some diapers as a gift)."
5,Love Swaddlers,"I love Pampers, they fit my LO's so well, very few blow outs! I love the wetness indicator on the smaller diapers as well."
2,Cause redness / chemical burns?,"The hospital provided these to us, and the brand we bought didn't hold water (nurtured by nature brand) so we bought some to go home, too. But we found his diaper area getting quite red. We thought it was wipes so switched wipes and also switched over to Huggies Pure & Natural and the redness went away. However, those ran a bit small so had some poo leaks with some watery stool blow-outs so went back to the Pampers Swaddlers not realizing they had caused the redness rather than the wipes. Took less than 24 hours to reach the conclusion that they did for sure cause the redness. We're back in the Huggies now but we're going to buy the next size up when they run out. FWIW, if your baby tolerates these they seem to hold liquid, even liquid poos quite well, no leaks. So, I give them 2 stars rather than 1 star. The Huggies are softer inside and out, though, and seem like a nicer product, really. Just hoping moving up a size helps us. Cheers,"
1,DryMax does not work,"The old swaddlers were the best on the market, but since changing to dry max they are leaky and create flare ups on baby's sensitive skin. This product has rave reviews because it USED to be good. I wish Amazon would update the posting to clarify that they are now selling the new ""improved"" (sarcasm) swaddlers diapers."
1,Change for the worse...and to divert sales to the more expensive Sensitive range...,"New scent has been added to the latest diapers, The scent is overpowering, I would not call it a small amount. We can smell it through her clothes and even after an hour or more when on our baby daughter.Another thing no longer on the diaper is the moisture sensor which was incredible helpful to us.I wonder if Pampers are doing this to make us buy the ""Sensitive Diapers"" instead which are more expensive...Disappointing that such a dramatic change is made in a product. There is absolutely no need for a scent on a baby product...We will have to review our next purchase, and most likely switch to another brand."
1,Gave my daughter horrible rash,"I have been a loyal Pampers user since my daughter was born. Unfortunately, Pampers changed their diapers in December of 2009 and the new version of the diapers gave my daughter a horrible rash with blisters. It took us nearly 4 weeks to figure it out. I thought about changing diapers, but she had always been fine in Pampers and we had spanned two different packages. I read some other reviews as we needed to order more diapers and found others' talking about this horrible rash. We changed her to huggies last night and literally in 1 day her rash is healed with only faint marks left. I can not believe that Pampers changed their product without some notification on the packaging or website. If your child has a horrible, blistered diaper rash that is not getting better with creams - try new diapers for a few days."
1,LEAKS!!,"These diapers are horrible!! Almost all of them have leaked and left my poor baby with wet clothes. I was previously using pampers swaddlers sensitive which was working fine, so I thought 'how different can these be?' The price is definitely not worth leaving my poor baby wet!"
1,SO STRONG PERFUME!!!!!!,"Why is it smell so much?? I just opened up the box of diapers that I got it from my baby shower, and the perfume of the diapers gave me a headache right away. The box and the description of this product didn't say anything about the scent. Think about me getting a headache just opening a box of diaper, what's going to happen to my little new born baby??? DO NOT BUY THIS DIAPER!!! Unless you like the strong perfume smell that knocks you out. I am so disappointed with Pampers."
4,"love Pampers, but.....","Love everything about Pampers and this diaper. Love the bulk pack, and the subscribe & save. However, I've found once my daughter started sleeping through the night, she peed through these, and we had to buy a box of Huggies for overnight. These are great during the day and sensitive enough for her bottom, but you may want to look for the extra dry pack or do what I did, and get something else for overnight..."
5,excellent buy,I bought the same brand same size from Grocery & Drug stores to try out. Once satisfied choose subscribe & save from amazon.com. That saved me about 15% $$$. Subscribe & Save me time and I am worry free now that product getting delivered to my door step without me searching and paying more cost at grocery stores.
3,Rather use sensitive,"I switched from Swaddlers Sensitive to regular Swaddlers recently, but found the regular ones leaving a film behind. The baby doesn't seem to mind, but it looks a little slimy so it bothers me."
1,Disapointing,"We love pampers, but this order was late and my baby outgrew this size! The company never returned my phone calls or emails so that I could return the product. I recommend finding diapers elsewhere"
5,Pampers Swaddlers is the Best,"I have been using Pampers Swaddlers since my daughter was born. I have tried to use less expensive kind of Pampers, but my daughter developed heat pumps easily using it. When I switched it back, no more issues. My guess is that Pampers Swaddlers has the best air flow. I also use this overnight. It's totally soaked with urine when my daughter wakes up in the morning, but has never leaked.Amazon's subscribe and save also saved me time to order and compare prices every time the diapers are about to run out."
4,Lasted a good while,I bought this economy size box for my son when he was 1month old. lasted him almost 1.5 months which to me is great. Would recommend.
5,Not always cheaper than the store....,"Not always cheaper than the store but this time they were....amazone from ti,e to time does run great deals....ohh and they kept my kid clean....h00t!"
3,"Okay diaper, Target is better","The diapers are soft and flexible, but my daughter wets them through super fast. It's not like I want her to wear them for 12 hours, but they can barely go 6 hours overnight without wetting through, and even during the day she feels damp sometimes, like they are seeping out, and the diapers not even full or been on her for more than a couple hours. I tried Target brand, and they get a little stiff when full, but they don't leak, so I like them."
3,Okay,These have leaked as often as the Huggies for us. Usually out the back if she is lying down. We put them on as tight as we can without hurting her. Maybe these work better for pudgy formula fed babies.
2,Not impressed,"These diapers are very soft and the hospital used them so I thought they would be great. I think that Pampers must donate them to the hospital becuase these diapers aren't great.They smell and are way too perfumey. Also, these are the only diapers that have regularly leaked on us when my daughter has a BM. It goes out the sides or up the back. They don't seem to have as much protection near the edges as other diapers. I've tried Huggies Gentle Care, Huggies Snug & Dry, and Seventh Generation and prefer them all to the Pampers Swaddlers."
1,These have dry max but product description doesn't warn you,I have worked very hard to avoid pampers with drymax based on the AWFUL reviews (enough to prompt the CSPC to do a study). These diapers arrived with a tiny box on the inside packaging saying dry max. I am horrified. Beware.
1,Thought i had the upper hand when it came to buying diapers. WRONG,"Price and quantity is awesome. Quality is poor. I really think that amazon gets a lower grade of diapers. My baby poops through them, there is no wet line and when she pees a lot, the diaper falls apart and little clear beeds come out of the diaper and get ALL over."
1,Not Happy might be got wrong batch,"As a first time Mom i expect that Pampers will be the best for my little one however i was wrong with this pack of Pampers Swaddlers. The inside diaper pad that supposed to be super absorbent it was not. These diapers are not that good ! Found some of the Diapers leaked, The diaper leaked liquid everywhere. Some Diapers had their flaps broken and I had to use tape to put the diapers on my baby. Very, very disappointedI'm not sure if we got a bad batch or if this size is just made cheaper; but I wouldn't recommend them at all.With my son it cause red irritation"
5,Love Pampers,"I'm a second time Mom and have tried Pampers, Huggies, and Kirkland diapers. By far Pampers are the softest and the best when it comes to leaks and blowouts."
4,Powder smell,"Swaddlers are great when it comes to fitting and no leaks. The wet indicator is a plus as well. More expensive than other brands. I just don't like the powdery smell on it. Other than that, it's great!"
5,The best!!!!!!!!,These are the very best by far. They never leak even after all night. I have made the mistake of trying other brands and they all seam to leak or just not absorb fast enough.
5,Will buy it for my baby from now on,"I bought huggies and pampers cruisers before. Huggies diapers are drier, but a little bit too thick and too tight for my baby. Pampers Swaddlers fit better for my baby and it smells so nice! Much better than pampers cruisers."
3,Does the trick!,"I feel a bit strange writing a diaper review...after all, I am not the ultimate end user! However from my perspective they do the necessary work, and have minimal downside (leaks, etc)."
5,keep her dry,love these diapers. they keep my daughter dry thanks to the special mesh. they are very soft and nice for her skin. I recommend to get a bigger size if you are deciding what size to get.
5,great diaper,"I LOVE the wetness indicator stripe, it is so convenient! A month ago when we ordered a huge box of 1-2's they had the wetness indicator. i am so happy with them and advise all to buy this company product as its clean easy and does the job always!!!!"
2,very easy to leak from behind,"It happened twice already after one week's use of this, poopoo leaks from the behind and messes up the bed.It never happened before with other pampers or huggies."
2,BLOWOUT,"I love Pampers Swaddlers. I love the softness and there are no ""pee crystals."" However, my nursing baby has blowouts almost every day. It is frustrating that I have to clean clothes and messes when he blows a big one!"
4,Good,"Good product, though I would prefer Pampers adding a better scent . Can hold up till 4 hours, post that it will be soaked if very heavy peeps"
5,Arrived as scheduled!,As always Amazon Mom came through! Great box of diapers just as I ordered! With the discount comes out to much cheaper than you can find in the stores.
2,These are not normal Swaddlers - no blue line,"I ordered these thinking they were the regular Swaddlers, which they are not. Found they didn't have the awesome blue line wetness indicator, and said ""OH HELL NO"". So I returned them.Are way softer than the normal Swaddlers, which is OK, but I don't really like them. They almost felt mushy to me.I'm sure they work as a diaper, but man that wetness indicator is nice to have!"
4,Great product!,"We used this pampers for size N and size 1. It is a good product with a good price and what is best is that I don't have to run to buy more diapers in the middle of the night. This one box of 234 count, lasts us a whole month."
5,Best diapers,"They don't leak, they change color when wet and can last through the night. Great diapers and my baby girrl hasn't had any issues with diaper rash (knock on wood!)."
5,Recommend.,"I like this brand ""Pampers"". My twins happy stay dry. Especially good for day time.For the night I recommend Pampers Baby Dry."
3,What's inside is different from what you order,"Arrived at my door much faster than the estimated ship date and all seemed good till I discovered that even though the box was labeled size 1, the box contained about 1/3 size 1's, and 2/3 size 1-2's which are a little bigger (for 10-15 lbs). Other than that, swaddlers's work well, and the wetness indicator is a great feature."
4,A different kind of diaper this shipment,"I know that they clearly state your product may not be the same every time, but we were still disappointed to be sent diapers without the dry strip. It is so easy to know when our baby needs to be changed that way. They are by FAR our favorite kind, and we wish Amazon would send these every time."
1,Beware of diaper rash,My daughter got bad diaper rash from these diapers. 9 months later she still has the scar. Never bought pamapers and switched to chlorine free diapers from then on.
2,Great While it lasted,"These pampers were the absolute best!!! Never leaked, no diaper rash, wetness indicator, very soft, and pleasant smell. BUYER BEWARE.... pampers has redesigned the entire line featuring drymax. The new diapers are such a decrease in quality, I can't figure why the are working backwards. I understand joining in with green movement by creating a less wasteful product, however they really need to go back to the drawing board on this one. My daughter got her first touch of diaper rash so now we are on the hunt for a better diaper. So sad."
1,"Live and learn, right?",Our first diaper purchase was these with the hope they'd be easy on baby with their supposedly cloth-like texture. Rather than have a cloth like texture they just seem cheap. More than once my baby has pottied out the diaper. In the back there is no second band to keep runny messes in and if he sleeps more than a couple hours at night I am sitting there contemplating whether I want to wake him up and make him fuss for fear he will pee through the diaper. Not a positive experience with these diapers. I much prefer the Huggies Snug & Dry I switched to before I was even through this container of Pampers.
5,Swaddlers are the Best!,"NO LEAKS! Well, as long as you are using the right size! These are so soft and the indicator line is a big plus. They handle blow outs well, but no matter what diaper you use, blowouts will happen. They also keep baby dry, no rashes yet!"
5,Used both Pampers and huggies,"We've experimented with quite a few brands of Diapers and also products within those brands and i Must say that out daughter has enjoyed Pampers Swaddlers more than any others. Each baby is different and in my case, i believe the form factor the way the diaper is made perfectly covers her bottom so shes able to crawl, move her legs at an excellent motion without having discomfort. Huggies in my opinion, the material feels a bit more plastic and Pampers has more of a cotton feel to it."
3,Mixed emotions on this one,"I had been using the Pampers Swaddlers for a while and overall it performed great. The fit matched the weights listed so I had no problems there. No leaks around the legs usually, but my baby is also a little chunky. I did had blowouts even when the diaper was still a little big. No diaper rashes. I liked these better than the Pampers Dry and Pampers Sensitive. Pampers Dry seem too thin and filled up quicker. Pampers Sensitive didn't seem to make much of a difference for the price.But my major concern and reason I ended up changing it was the chemical smell. Once this diaper has pee, it seems to have a very strong chemical smell. We thought it was one of the batches, but the next box (and one after that) all had the same issue. I ended up switching to the Nature Babycare diapers. Since I was switching away from the mainstream diapers, I decided to go for compostable diapers."
5,Better!,"Pampers really improved this time with their new diapers. Some people may not know that Pampers just silently released a new ""model"", but these are even better than previous ones. They increased the total number of diapers and also brought back the wet strip indicator from before. It is amazing how nice this really is (instead of always grabbing the diaper to know if it's wet or not and possibly waking a baby). As other people have noted, they do have quite an odd smell...but I can deal with it since these are the best diapers for our little guy. We have only had a couple ""blow outs"" over the past 6 months of using them compared to 1 in 5 of the ""other"" brand."
4,The Best Choice,"I had my kids 13 yrs. apart and couldn't remember which diapers I had liked with the 1st child. I tried out several brands and decided on these. Then I remembered that I had done the same thing 13 years prior. These only leak on very rare occasions, they have a stripe to tell you when they're wet, they feel super soft, the tabs don't rip off, they hold a lot. I change my baby very often but overnite his diaper gets pretty full. These almost never leak. I can't say the same for some other brands we tried."
4,Esp. good for smaller babies,"I found that Pampers fit my little guy best for the first couple of months, though now I'm preferring the Huggies styling for the most part. The Pampers seemed to have more adjustable leg openings for when skinny little legs needed to be accommodated. As my baby has gotten bigger, the chunkier legs have seemed to pair better with the leg openings on the Huggies."
5,Great diapers!,Loved these diapers for my little gill. We went through many different styles before we settled on pampers. We are having less blowouts and such.
5,Love them,"I've been using these diapers since the begging. They are soft and reliable, and love the wet indicator, it is very useful during the first 2 months and afterwards it is still nice to have it."
2,Rashy babies,"These are causing more diaper rash than the Earths best diapers I ordered last month.We started with pampers swaddlers in the hospital, and we love the indicator line. After trying the Earths best diapers last month I missed the indicator line. But my twins are getting terrible diaper rashes and I don't like the fragrance added to these. At first it smells like baby powder, sort of, but once they soil the diaper it smells really weird. I would honestly rather smell the poo so I know they need changing.I am going back to the Earthsbest brand, I feel better knowing those are bleach free for my twins' skin too."
2,not impressed,These diapers were not Pamper quality. They were a cheaper (?) made diaper or the material that they were made from was. I was not impressed with these so went back to the Cruisers.
2,"Ok, not the best","Some of the diapers seemed faulty. Still usable, but the tabs wouldn't open all the way. This pack was more expensive than most I've bought on amazon as well..."
5,DON'T SKIMP ON YOUR DIAPERS!,These are the best diapers - and I have been using these since my daughter was born. The mesh lining in the diaper is fantastic and we haven't had any incidents of diaper rash yet!
1,"Product fine, vendor not so fine.","I have only purchased from outside vendors through Amazon a few times but I was very disappointed with the lack of customer service from Boom Baby. I received free shipping however I ordered the incorrect size diapers and they would not pay for return shipping. It was going to cost me $18.00 to ship it and an additional $7.50 restocking fee to get back another set of diapers, This was almost the price of the diapers themselves! I will only purchase through Amazon from now on and not from their outside vendors."
5,Do the job and haven't looked elsewhere,"Our son was started on these on day one, and they seemed to work great, and have never once had an issue with them."
5,These diapers are great,"Been using ""swaddlers"" since my daughter was born and have never had an issue. Having the blue line indicator is helpful too. We tried two other types of diapers in a pinch, and both didn't fit very well and seemed uncomfortable. These fit well and stay in place"
5,good deal,"I use pampers swaddlers diapers, they are very soft. I bought via amazon becouse this box of diapers is realy economy pack."
5,good value,Great value. Quick shipping. Don't have to drive everywhere to pick them up at the store. Gas is going back up and it is a pain to bring an infant to the store with you. You can't beat this.
3,no wet indicator,"pros: comfortable, easy to change, no leaking, soft.cons: no wet indicator, have to buy sensitive series."
3,Mysterious brown spots on every diaper,"I am a big fan of Pamper's Swaddlers. I have never had an issue with leaks or rashes.My only issues are that on my most recent order, all of the diapers had a small brown spot on the bottom. At first I thought it was from the baby, but I looked though the package and all of the new diapers had a spot. I've used this brand before and ordered them from Amazon with no spots.The other thing is that, as others have mentioned, sometimes the diapers have the wetness indicator, and sometimes they don't. On my previous order, all diapers had the wetness indicator, which I love. I placed an order for the exact same brand and package, and this time none had the wetness indicator. You just don't know what you're getting.The diapers themselves are nice, but these few quirks bothered me."
3,"Good diapers, cheaper elsewhere","Great diapers, but they are currently on sale at a significantly reduced price on diapers.com, even compared to the subscribe and save price."
4,the right brand,"great volume, very good diaper. it was an excellent fit for my baby and never leaked even at times when the diaper was engorged with pee"
5,"Very soft, has pee stripe and fits well","Overall, this diaper is a great first diaper to use for your newborn. I bought pampers because that's the only brand I had really heard prior to becoming a mother. I was very satisfied with how soft they are and how the elastic legs don't seem to be too tight for babies. As a first time parent, I also appreciate the wetness indicator. I became obsessed with changing my baby if I even saw a hint of the stripe. Now that he's 1 year old, I can relax a bit...These are the diapers I choose when I make diaper cakes for girlfriends' baby showers. They have a very white, fluffy and soft look to them... and I know the diapers will get used since they're considered a ""premium.""While I really like these, I also highly recommendHuggies Pure & Natural Diapers, Newborn, 72 Countbecause those don't have a scent. The pampers scent isn't very strong but it's noticeable whereas the Huggies Pure and Natural is odorless."
5,Love these diapers!,"There's a reason they give you this brand in the hospital. I've never had a problem with the swaddles, and if I have it's because someone (mother-in-law) didn't put the diaper on properly. I love the indicator strip that turns from yellow to blue when the diaper is wet, it can be difficult to tell when a newborn goes number one. I'm always amazed at how much these diapers hold everything in; I've opened up some diapers and I'm shocked there wasn't any sort of spillage. They are very absorbent as well, we've never had an issue with diaper rash. I particularly like the bigger box, it's astounding how many diapers a baby goes through. This box of 234 lasts us a good 3 weeks."
5,Very nice diapers,I order this one pack and it's good for one whole month and no problems of leak or rashes etc. I m totally satisfied with shipping speed too.
2,Wierd chemical smell,"I normally use huggies but thry have been leVing a strange BLUE INK stain on my son's skin and onesies ni ordered the pampers for my newborn daughter and they have a very strong chemical smell.They fit great, dont leak but the smell . . .I wont be ordering them again"
5,Comfortable for baby,"I tried these and huggies, and the pampers have a less papery feel to them. They also seem to fit better and don't leave red marks on the baby's sides like the huggies did. No issues with leaks or wetness."
4,"Slightly Disappointed, but good product","Have been very impressed with Pampers Swaddlers since we brought our baby home, but was disappointed when we received a different product with our second shipment. we had ordered the Pampers Swaddlers with Dry Max and received those on our first order and then the second order was not the Dry Max type (cool blue line on diaper when wet). Thought that this was what we had ordered. Overall product is great and keeps wetness away from baby better than other brands that we tried."
5,Swaddlers are in league of their own for Dryness,"Caution: Do not buy your first pack of Pampers Swaddlers diapers if you are not willing to pay a little more...because you will be hooked! We've tried to cut costs by buying other diapers, but nothing keeps our baby dry like the Swaddlers. The mesh lining is unique only to Pampers. The irony in buying the ""Baby Dry"" diapers was that our baby's bottom stayed wet.Pay less money for other diapers and you'll probably change your baby more often and fight diaper rash. Buy Pampers Swaddlers and you and your baby will be very happy."
5,Love it,"I love this product, I have tried several brands of diapers and this by far is our favorite. The fact we can have them delivered is wonderful. I have been telling everyone that I know would benefit from this!"
5,Best Diapers,"These are the best diapers I've used so far (also tired Luvs, Huggies & Target). The wetness indicator is nice (especially for new moms) but certainly not essential. I think you can go a bit longer without changing."
1,"wrong size, red butt",I ordered size 1 and received size 1-2.My daughter got a red butt after using them.I will never buy them again.
5,great price! great diapers!,I really like this diapers I received another brands as a.gift but this ones are definetely the softest. I recommend this diapers.
2,Caused HORRIBLE rash on my little guy!,"I like Pampers diapers, or at least I had in the past, but this last package we received caused a horrible rash on my son. I believe it was caused by the indicator strip and whatever chemicals are used to help create the color change to indicate when baby is wet. We had used Pampers swaddlers when he was a newborn and then again in size 2 before color indicators were standard on all swaddlers up to size 3, and had no problems. I gave the diaper 2 stars because even though they caused a horrible rash on my son, we had no other major problems with the diapers."
2,pampers size 1 234 packs,"The hospital our child was born used pampers and gave us an extra pack when we left. We liked it as it did not leak comparing with a couple other brands we tried using at the beginning. So we designed to stay with this. We also liked the indicator design. So we bought this bulk pack (size 1 234 pieces) when the stock was running low the first time. But the first week we were using it, it leaked 2 - 3 times already, not sure why this would be different that those we got from the hospital."
2,Good deal on diapers but they leak,"It was a good price for the amount of diapers we got, but disappointed that they leaked after only 3 hrs of wear."
3,wrong size,"first time buying diapers online but the price was so good i couldnt pass it up. but got the diapers and they were the wrong size. amazon was great w/ the return process and now i have, hopefully, the right size coming to me. they even upgraded shipping to next day due for free due to their error. fingers crossed its right this next time :)"
2,Horrible tabs,I would say that one out of every three diapers in this package came with faulty tabs that tore during the diaper change. And out of a 234 count package that is a LOT of wasted money and one very pissed off baby whose diaper change now takes three times as long. I'm extremely disappointed and will be trying others.
2,These don't have the wetness indicator (yellow/blue line),"For those of you that are buying Pampers for the wonderful ""Wetness Indicator"" (that yellow line that turns blue when they have peed), you will be disappointed when you get these.Read the reviews of the Pampers Sensitive equivalents and I believe those have the Wetness Indicator."
4,Love These Diapers,"These diapers work very well on my daughter. Have been using them since she was born and they are the absolute best. Super soft, don't bind or bunch up -- and hold her messes better than anything else. I've taken off one star because before she began solids (only on breast milk) there were some issues with messes going up her back - but honestly nothing else did a better job anyway. She's crawling now and they still work very well -- considered switching to Cruisers but why fix what isn't broken."
2,Not as pictured,"We love Pampers Swaddlers, but were very disappointed with the diapers that we received. The images on the website show that these diapers have the wet indicator stripe that we find very helpful. The diapers delivered did not have this stripe. The diapers were also thinner than the Size 1 Swaddlers we are used to. I suspect Amazon has an old lot of diapers they are trying to get rid of."
4,Best among the ones I tried,I like this specific brand because it has a wetness indicator that is very convenient in detecting a soiled diaper without opening the diaper
5,diaper savings diaper$off,I love these diapers never a leak and soft and gentle. However they can get pricey. Using Amazon and [...] with code diaper$off they are a great price.
2,Leak,I had a bad experience with this diapers. They leaked all the time on my baby's back. It was very annoying. Don't recomend them. They are missing the elastic band that the huggis have.
1,Size 2 diapers are much thinner and clearly an inferior product. I am extremely disappointed.,"They do not look and feel the same as size 1 diapers I got through subscription via amazon. I had this problem with size N that I bought through amazon. They were different from size N I got at the hospital and didn't fit too well but I gave these another try since its such a good deal price wise! Size 1 pack turned out alright but size 2 which I received recently is definitely of much inferior quality. The perfume is stronger, the diapers are thinner, the mesh often comes off and white particles stick to my baby's bottom too. I suspect either they are poor quality seconds stock or they are old stock which is why the deal is so good. I am planning on cancelling this subscription if I find that store bought pampers of the same size are of superior quality."
2,Mesh liner=pain and rash for new baby,"The liner does and always has caused problems with the baby's bottom. I don't buy them for this reason. Huggies cut his legs, so I go with LUVS when using conventional diapers. I can't see paying more for diaper rash. They actually did worse to prevent leaks than LUVS especially when the babe is down for a long nap."
5,Great for shipping elsewhere!,"This was a great price and a great gift for a new baby who needed diapers but lives accross the country from me. Would use this product again for the same thing, any new baby."
5,Love the diapers!,"I started using these diapers after using them in the hospital. I really like them. I've tried out several other diapers, and i find they just don't compare. I'm as cheap as they come. So after doing much research, i found that Amazon Mom offered the best price. Its very unfortunate that Amazon Mom is going to start charging for the service, as well as shipping after the free period is over. I'm thankful that i have this available to me until August, but after that, i would rate amazon lower, not the product, due to the price. I will most likely be shopping for diapers elsewhere after this time period is up."
5,love love LOVE!,"I have used these diapers from day 1 at the hospital & my son is now almost 3 months old. Haven't had any leaks, & I love the wetness indicator. My son hates being even a little wet, so having the line is so handy. I tried huggies because they were given as a gift & they leaked so many times. I got tired of having to change his outfits because of leaky diapers. So I switched back to pampers & I don't plan on using huggies again...never going back to huggies!"
4,Great Diapers,"Being first time parents and on a tight budget we tried every kind of ""inexpensive"" diaper we could find but it seemed like we were having blow outs and changing our son ALL the time! With these diapers we have only had a few blow outs and those were ones that no diaper could have held. A little expensive but with Amazon Prime and Subscribe and Save its a little cheaper and is totally worth it!"
5,Pampers: GOTTA LOVE 'EM!,"I'm a Pampers mom - so I'm sharply biased toward them. I wasn't ready to put my baby into Crusiers just yet because she was outgrowing her size 2. The 2-3 size isn't found in any of the stores in our area so I found them here. Now the price wasn't as great as I've found in WalMart or Target with a coupon; but her 2's were too small and she wasn't quite big enough for the 3's. This purchase was well worth every single penny, for the fit alone. The Pampers quality, softeness, and smell were already #1 in my book. They also keep her nice and dry! We love them!"
4,We have been very happy,"These have been great, they seem to keep 99.5% of the stuff in.As opposed to the Huggies we tried which just spilled everywhere.In extreme cases, you might get tiny amounts of leakage aroundthe legs. When he was ready for the next size sometime pee wouldget channeled out the top of the diapers when I was breast feeding.But this started only when he was getting too big for the diapers."
4,Soft and most of the babies like it,Pampers Swaddlers Diapers are soft and comfortable for the baby. Pampers is my favorite choice and I love the Swaddlers.
5,Best diapers out there,"According to the 3 different Pampers reps I spoke with, as of 2012 no Pampers Swaddlers from NB-3 have dry-max. It's only when you reach size 4 is that added.With that done, I've been a swaddlers fan since my LO was born and they have never disappointed me. If you get leakage or blowouts, the diaper is either too big or too small. Going up or down a size fixed that issue every time for us. They also hold so much liquid it's ridiculous! I've removed diapers heavier than softballs after a solid 9hrs sleep with NO LEAKS!Still the best deal out there too for the quantity and quality."
5,Best Diaper,"These are the best diapers! I used this for my first and now my second baby. I love how the mesh keeps the wetness away from baby, the thinness, and the wetness indicator. My only wish is that they made these diapers in larger sizes."
4,swaddlers,We've been using the pampers swaddlers for our newborn. We love the blue line indicator and the fit has generally been good but as my daughter is now 7 weeks old I have found she frequently goes through the diaper and we have to change her from head to toe. I am not sure if any diaper would be different but thats been our experience.
5,always pampers,"i use pampers for all my kids, never use another brand. swaddler is soft for babies, which is important because baby's delicate skin."
5,Big time Swaddlers with Drymax fan!,I know some babies have issues with dry max and I'm lucky that our son is NOT one of them because I really love these diapers. Never a leak or a blowout and the wetness indicator is great. I tried Huggies but went back to these because they are wonderful!
5,Pampers are a perfect fit.,For every derriere there is the perfect diaper. It just so happens that this diaper was an excellent fit. No leaks and it keeps baby dry. The diaper size is such that it is not an issue to pack multiple diapers in the bag without having too much space taken. I would recommend.
3,"Great Product, HUGE PRICE INCREASE...!","This product is great, I would recommend it anyone with a new baby. It is very soft, and the wetness indicator is great, especially for first time parents and dads.however, when I first got this with Amazon Mom and Subscribe and Save it was only $30, now it is $44, everything on subscribe and save and amazon mom has taken a price hike. I can get this at BJ's with their $2-$5 coupons for less now. (under $40)"
5,better than huggies,"I love these diapers! They fit great, don't bother my daughters super sensitive skin, and the blue line that appears when the diaper is wet is super convenient. I would recommend these diapers over Huggies any day."
4,Pampers Swaddlers,"Pampers Swaddlers are definitely worth the price. They are not only soft against my baby daughter's skin, but they also fit snugly also keep wetness away, minimizing leaks and diaper rash occurrences.While Luvs, Pampers regular, and store brand diapers, are less expensive, they often leak and sag. As a result, I end up having to either change my daughter more often or experience the trying task of changing her diaper and outfit when it leaks. Pampers Swaddlers have rarely leaked and are easily fastened for maximum comfort.I will continue using Pampers Swaddlers as long as I can and would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a soft, comfortable diaper for your little ones!"
4,An Outstanding Interpretation!,"Gospel At ColonusThis is an amazing re-creation of Sophocles' classical tragedy of the ""Oedipus The King"" which includes some of the most gifted entertainers of our time: Morgan Freeman, Clarence Fountain and ""The Five Blind Boys of Alabama,"" and many others of equal talent. This is a thoroughly enjoyable filmed version of the production that was given in Philadelphia in 1985 and which received raved reviews. It's not to be missed."
5,Love these lentils!,"I absolutely love these lentils. You get the high protein and fiber that you get from beans, but they cook very quickly. They are a very small lentil. They can be used as a side dish, in soup, and cooled then put in salads. Very versital.A 1/2 cup serving is about 100 calories with zero fat. You also get 4 grams of Fiber, with is very important in your diet. Along with 6 grams of Protein. Wow, fat free protein!"
5,Delicious!,"This is the first time I've had black beluga lentils after hearing so much food blog hype about them, and I have to say I'm not disappointed. The lentils are quite small (compared to the red, brown, or green ones I've had before) and have a good, rich, somewhat mushroomy flavor. They were easy to cook and held there shape really well."
5,Castle Donnington ? Imagine....,"Mostly musicians reviewing this film...i am no exception....i swear,right down to the hair,the bickering,lack of talent and high on misguided dreams of grandiose,..this was MY band...Still howl everytime i think of Vim and the boys... Excellent acting,wonderful script,well paced... It's a Brit-com...need i say more ? Just don't turn traitor on your music and work in a BANK !!!"
4,"Predates Spinal Tap, for me at least","For me, it doesn't really matter which one was released first, both Bad News Tour and This is Spinal Tap are great.And to correct an error in an earlier review, it wasn't Reading, it was Monsters of Rock at Donnington that the band played. I know, because I was there! And the scene at the end where the crowd storm the stage and attack the band? Almost happened! I don't know how much the band knew about it, but from where I was standing I could see about 10,000 people and only 3 were laughing! (I was one.) The rest of the people around me were booing and saying stuff like ""I'm going to F**king kill him!"". That's pretty much when I realised that I was over Metal. When you can't laugh at yourself, it's all over! And the band about three places up the bill? Scorpions! I can't watch Spinal Tap without seeing Scorpions all over it (if the album Smell the Glove isn't Animal Magnetism I'll eat my hat!), but Scorpions were dead serious!"
4,Hilarious satire of the world of heavy metal in the 80's,"Hilarious two-part spoof in the tradition of ""This Is Spinal Tap"", Bad News is made up of the cast of ""The Young Ones"" which aired on MTV back in the mid eighties after originally appearing on the BBC. These two episodes were first shown on another BBC comedy called ""The Comic Strip"". Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmundson, and Nigel Planer are hysterical as the hopelessly out-of-touch and out-of-talent heavy metal act, Bad News. Watch their rise and fall as they go from playing empty local clubs clubs to somehow getting booked at Castle Donnington, and subsequently being beaten off-stage by angry metal fans. A little slow at times, but fans of British humor and send-ups like ""Spinal Tap"" will love it!"
4,"These Bears Aren't ""Bad News""","Rock On, ""Bad News"". This video is great for those fans of Britcoms like ""The Young Ones"", ""Bottom"", or ""Filthy Rich and Catflap"". It has most of the same actors and even if you're not familiar with the comic genius of Ric Mayall, Adrian Edmondson, or Nigel Planer, you'll still appreciate this spoof of sorry cliched rock bands. This is the truly British equivalent of ""Spinal Tap"" with just as much venom but a bigger heart as well. The only question I have is ""Where's the DVD?"""
5,This product this great,This product works great after i finish scrubbing my feet putting this on helps soften any callus or corn that i have then the next day its almost gone plus it smells good like peppermint candy.
3,"Fun craft, maybe not for drinking from","The mugs are smaller than your average coffee cup, and you are not supposed to paint near the rim where you might put your mouth(?!?!). That is difficult with small children at the helm. The real problem was the brushes were squished and flat and the paint could not be applied smoothly or neatly with them. Maybe if we had had our own painting accessories it would have helped. I eventually pulled out some Q tips. The kids didn't care, they had fun anyway, and it was a gift for their father that they got to make ""themselves"". I just told him to use one for holding pencils or something and not to drink from it. You also cannot put these in the dishwasher, or your paint might wash off."
2,Overpriced,"This product is overpriced for what you get. It comes with two mugs and tiny containers of basic paint colors with paint brush. My two daughters were thrilled to use this kit, but I thought the paint went on poorly. I can't imagine even attempting to make the cups look like the ones pictured on the package. Once the painted cups dry for 2 hours, you need to bake the cups in the oven for 1/2 hr. to set the paint. This seemed like a waste of energy. Also, I think the company could use better packaging by avoiding the huge solid chunk of styrofoam -- certainly not environmentally friendly."
4,Good Auto Insurance Expose' and good read,"Mr. Andrews has written a fictional, but very interesting novel on the auto insurance industry. You will never see the ads on tv about lowest price again without thinking about how they get the price lower. The book is even more interesting because Michael was a manager for one of the bigger auto insurance companies and has insider information.The book holds your interest and makes a good read. Fair amount of excitement."
5,Golden Panflute Melodies,"Golden Panflute MeldiesIt was as equal to my disk Feelings, 20 golden panflutemelodies Thatcher was demmaged and that I lied verl much."
1,Wall Flower is what it has become,"This product is something nice to look at. The first one I purchased came damaged so I returned for one that worked. the rhinestones are not secure on the product and the lights don't work great. My daughter loves pink and fluffy things, I thought this would be good for her room, but she never touches it for the talking part or even looks into the fake mirrow that I thought would be real glass. So it is now a Wall flower just up for decor.....Disappointed!"
3,Decent tray,"I have this tray bought from BedBathBeyond. It works and it only cost 10 bucks, actually 8 bucks because of the 20% off coupon that they send bimonthly. Can't expect much for 8 dollars but it does its job, my first one broke when a glass fell on top of it, the wood split, surprisingly it broke the fall on my glass and there was not even a scratch on my glass. I have another one now."
2,it's ok,They arrived with some noticable scratches and color differences on their tops. I expected them to be new and the tops looked a bit worn or used in some way. Decided they were functional at least and didn't want to hassle with sending them back...
2,"Flimsy, poorly made","This product is pretty much what it's advertised to be ... except, if you're looking for something durable that will be able to handle regular use, look elsewhere. The wood if very lightweight and assembly is low-quality (what you'd expect to find in street markets and Chinatown-type settings)."
5,INFINITE REVELATION,"You cannot imagine how understanding the Hebrew has changed my life, and empowered me to know what, and how supreme Life is. Combined with the New Testament Word Study, this will enable you to see into the Spiritual domain, and enthrall endlessly at the genius and pre-meditation of YHVH's relished Infinite meaning(s) of His name(s), passions and intense paradigms; making His own self-Existent and Eternal Expression personal to you."
4,Very good reference about power supply design,"Regarding the content, I'm still reading the book but it is very interesting, I bought this book because it is a very good reference as far as the power supply design is concerned"
5,Very thorough and readable,"The book is so clearly written you can open it practically anywhere and read just the items of interest.Concepts are supported by properly simplified schematics.All the math needed for your own designs is shown and explained, but in such a way, that if you do not need the math right now, you can skip it.Half the reason I bought this book was to learn to build switching power supplies, the other half was to learn analog design in general. The book is excellent for both purposes."
4,Deep and thorough,A very good book that covers most of the power converter architectures. An excellent addition to your personal library.
4,A very good survey book,"Pressman's book is one of those good reference books that belongs on every designer's shelf. It contains a broad sweep of the subject, and is very useful when doing a topography trade study. But the best is at the ends of the chapters, where Pressman has referenced his sources. One can then investigate the more detailed source material.The limitation of Pressman's book is the lack of depth in the subject. That means this is not the only book you'll need. You will also have to get those references, because the information in this book is really only excerpts from the thirty years of developments summarized here. But that limitation is really Pressman's charter- a summary of the art and science of switching power supply design."
3,Not what I expected,"Although a good primer on the basic switching topologies, with an excellent chapter on inductor and transformer design, I couldn't help but feel that this book is more than a little outdated (which it is, at nine years old). There was no mention of synchronous or polyphase switchers, inductorless converters, charge pumps, high-frequency designs...and the section on MOSFETs left out what I feel was a great deal of information about paralleling and load sharing. Many of Linear Technology's app notes go above and beyond the material presented in this book...and they're free."
5,An easy read that clarifies men's motivations and fears.,"Five Keys for Understanding Men, has helped me to look at men differently. The light is now on as to what drives men's psyche. Although some of the information is somewhat shocking, I'm glad to be more enlightened about what makes men tick.I think I'll be more compassionate towards men's basic needs as a result of this read. However, don't get too excited guys I've still got my standards."
2,Alright,It had some good insight on men. Till the very end was when they explained it more. I felt like the book was mostly unrelated quotes and not so much in mind insight.
3,It's all about the Freud.,"Dr. Malone relies heavily upon Freud's psychoanalytic theory... If you haven't had at least an Intro to Psych course, it may bore you to tears. If you're not a huge Freud fan (me either), then some of it may be hard to swallow. Still, there's a lot to be said about the way women tend to emasculate men. :-) All in all, the book wasn't bad."
2,Five Keys for Understanding MenL: a Womans Guide.,"Written for the under 40's. Most of the contents (for older women) come under the 'duh' category.As an author I was looking for some facts in black and white. Men respond to a situation because of this set of physiological responses. This proportion of a man's proclivities is due to the inherent masculine, that proportion to his own personality. Men are sensitive to this kind of stimulation while the other doesn't even appear on their horizon.How much of the feminine 'tend and befriend' are they susceptible to? How much reciprocation might there be? Or will the response be protect and defend?None of this was available.As such it went into the e-trash as soon as possible."
2,No information on sugar amount.,"There is no information on how much sugar is in anything in this book, it's lumped in with carbs but I want to count sugar specifically. Otherwise this would be an amazing book."
3,Good Diet Counter,"This book has pretty much everything you need diet-wise, giving you calories, fat, sodium, exchanges, etc. It also included protein, which was something I needed to keep track of as a pre-weight loss surgery patient, so that was most helpful. I wish it covered a few more foods-it always seems like I need the information on the one thing that's not there.But overall it's a solid guide."
4,Yep,"I love Grant Morrison Doom Patrol soo much, but this one is not as good as Tha Painting that Ate Paris is. Buy that one first, then this one if you can.The little bit at the beggining with them at group therapy is one of my favorites though. Danny the Street is cool, but maybe a bit too random w/o purpose, and the alien designs and overall story from Persephone onwards is really creative and cool, but lacks luster as far as the detials go.I would recommend it though."
3,wtf!!??,you can see morrison is still perfecting his craft at this early stage of his writing career.... not quite as good as the first two books....
3,Expected Better Quality For The Price,"It is nice that older editions can be reproduced for those of us who are reading out of print literature and doing research.However, the quality of the reproduction is ok but for the money one should expect something a little better. They should scan at a higher resolution for text and especially images.If you don't care about higher quality then this type of book is ok."
3,"Less complicated,","makes a better read. As usual, good Key west color, good writing and plotting that is more focused. Alex is less of an observer this time and the reader benefits. One wonders about the time line. In the books months pass, while here years go by."
1,Not worth the money...,"This dvd was not worth what I paid for it. There's little information that isn't already known by most. You would do much better by buying a good biography of HM Elizabeth II. The whole thing seemed cheap, from the quality of the video footage and audio to the over-used news footage that everyone has seen 100 times."
2,Oops,"Does what it is supposed to, but wire is too short for my purpose. About two feet long, it's hard to reach very far from a battery."
1,Garbage,"Not long enough for a practicle application, got very hot when i was able to feed it through to hook it up and then burned out...Pure garbage!"
5,Did the job!,This adapter did the job. Wasn't to impressed with the insulation but it did the job perfectly. I would recommend this product!
5,Good Product for my use....,"After having read some negative reviews I was skeptical, but after buying one I am very satisfied. First, the ""cigarette lighter"" style receptacle works good. It is not too tight and works smoothly as well as making good contact. It has a rubber cap to cover the outlet when not in use. Also it is not too flimsy as it is made of plastic but seems durable enough. The clamps have smooth jaws with no teeth which may be an issue when clamping to battery posts. It is fine for me as I am clamping on to the binding posts of a bench top power supply which are threaded and smaller than those on a battery. The cables are not super long but are plenty long enough for my use and are of a reasonable gauge (16 or 14 gauge? not sure}. Haven't had any issues with the cable connections at the clamp (I read that others have). The price was very good. About 5 or 6 bucks I think. Will definitely buy another if the need arises."
5,Two Feet Long 14-Gauge Wire,"In all four previous reviews and in the product description there is no mention on how long these cables are! In the picture they look pretty long, and you would think length would be a primary concern. So, from the back of the product packaging, once I received the product, here you are: 2 Feet long, 14-gauge wire."
3,Not great but the price is right,"Works as advertised. As noted in the other reviews, the lead length is a little on the short side and you might need an extender for equipment designed with the intent of being connected to the console. The clips don't have any 'teeth' and the grip strength is fairly weak. You can't pull on the leads at all or they will come off."
3,Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter Adapter,Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter AdapterWhen I first looked at the product the cable length looked longer than the real thing... It works pretty well but I was disappointed with the clamps which are too small and the tubber cover for the socket was broken with no damage to the packaging... I guess for the price I shouldn't expect a whole lot...
4,"A must have for any ""prepper.""","A must have if you are a prepper. It lets you hook up any battery and use devices that are 12v capable, including inverters. The wires are heavy guage and everything seems well built. I HAVE NOT put this product to use yet."
4,Simple and sturdy,"Instant 12v receptacle, not much more I can say about it. the leads are a little scrawny but comparable to similar products."
4,Good Quality,"Not bad, decent Chinese quality, gets the job done. The actual cables (not including plug and clamps) on mine are 29 inches. Clamps have strong springs and open to 1 inch."
3,"OK product, pitifully slow order processing by supplier",The product is ok as far as being useful for what it was intended but it isn't any good if I have to wait 1.5 weeks to get it. This didn't come from Amazon's warehouse so I can't blame them but they should sell products from companies that process orders as quickly as they do. This item showed to be in stock from the beginning so there is no reason it should take over a week to be processed and shipped. Will avoid items supplied by this Non-Amazon company in the future.
2,My bad,I should have read what this was better before ordering it....I hope to get use from it...but not to bright.
5,"Very nice, must-have item.","Well made and durable. This is an inexpensive, must have item for campers, outdoorsmen, or hobbyists. For this price, it is worth it to have more than one."
4,battery clips,wires could of been a little more heavy. clips are ok and the plug in is made very nice. if wires where a little more heavy i would of given a 5 star
4,Great product but slow service,Product was as described. However it came a week late so wasn't impressed. The quality of the product was great.
5,Easy to use,"I got this for several reasons to use if power is out, for by car ready emergency bag.It worked great for both. I have an adapter to convert to a plug in it worked good with this, I also tested a cook pan powered by a plug in lighter and it worked good also."
4,Let's Get Ready To Rumble!!!,"Awesome album by a great surf band of the sixties! ""Boss"" is without a doubt the best surf instrumental I have ever heard! It rocks big time! I was quite impressed with the musicianship of this group! The sax/guitar/drums/bass interplay is just wonderful! I was also surprised at how young these guys were! To play like this at 17 & 18 years of age is rare! If you love the early surf sound,this album is for you! You won't be dissapointed! Turn on your sunlamp,open up a cold beer & enjoy a ""wild weekend"" w/ The Rumblers!"
4,Johnny Cash Anthology,"Purchased originally for ""Johnny Cash - Half a mile a day"" documentary included in special features.Enjoyed both products and am very happy with purchase. Satisfied with delivery,etc."
4,Great sampling!,This is a great DVD of the music of Johnny Cash. The video clips are from some of his best performances. It can truly be called an anthology. Songs from the early years through the nineties are here. The interviews with people like Merle Haggard and Waylon Jennings give insight to the man named Johnny Cash. I would highly recommend this to anyone who even has a slight interest in the music of Johnny Cash. The one thing I dislike about this collection is that I would prefer that they would not have spoken over the beginnings and endings of the songs. I'm glad that this was released while Johnny is alive so that he can be encouraged by all the kind words spoken about him and the influence that he has had on people in and out of the music industry.
5,Excellent,"I can't get enough of Johnny Cash, I'm glad I purchased this DVD.Lots of Johnny in his younger days. A lot of his hits uninterruptedThis is a must for any Johnny Cash fan."
3,pro carpenter,"Over the years I have bought 3 of these saws, however the new version is heavier and less well balanced than previous ones. Also Porter Cable have chosen to sell the saw with a canvas bag instead of the sturdy plastic case it came in before (the new saw does not fit in the case that the previous model came in either). The saw barely fits in the canvas bag with the zipper straining to close. Furthermore you can't put a spare blade in the bag because 1) the bag is too small and 2) it would shred the bag to pieces. This is a problem because you don't want to throw a spare blade in with your hand tools or in the back of your truck. Perhaps consider the Milwaukee instead ??"
2,Broken saw,"Bought this saw four months ago. After about two weeks the keyless blade change quit working. Then today was using it, left it on a saw horse, saw got bumped causing it to fall. When I picked it up the depth adjustment was broke. Disapointed that porter cable did not make the saw better. Saw has great power and is balanced well."
1,Would give it a zero for safety,"I bought this saw online and the first time I used it, I nearly cut off my hand. The blade guard is so poorly designed that it will only free the cut material if used left-handed. That's ridiculous -- you get a left hand blade so you can view kerf better.Second, this ""professioal"" saw does not accept diamond arbor blades, has no framing hook and no after-market arbor blade flange conversion.Bottom line: Overpriced, unsafe amatuer-grade saw. I returned it and lost $30 in shipping, but value my digits and extremities more."
2,definite quality problems,"This saw is not an appropriate replacement for the model 743K, in fact its not even in the same league. After just 2 days on the job the keyless blade change broke rendering this saw useless, and the dust nozzle is too small .... all it does is stay hopelessly clogged. It works fine if all you do is cut perfectly dry lumber, but what contractor is able to do that on a daily basis? The rip guide attachment in only good to around 8 inches where as the model 743K has a 12 plus inch rip capacity with the exact same rip guide. Take a professionals advice and buy a 743K if you can still find one. Porter Cable really goofed on this one!!!"
2,Great Saw... until you drop it.,"I've owned my own a residential construction business for over 20 years. As you can imagine, I've seen and used my fair share of circular saws. Porter Cables previous circular saws (743 and 347) were among the best I had ever used. So I was very happy to buy a few of the newer MAG saws when they came out.And they performed wonderfully... for a while. All three of them have broken where the table meets the depth adjustment guide. Yes, they were dropped. From 3'. It should go without saying a commercial duty tool should NOT break so easily.The repair guy at the local tool store that caters to contractors said he has seen 100's of these with the same problem. So, I am back to shopping for the older ones on eBay."
3,Returned it.,"I had the same problem as the first reviewer-the saw only works right if you're using it left-handed. I didn't have any safety issues, but the saw got stuck right after each cut-before I had moved it through the wood. When sawing right-handed, you hold the material on the left side. If you're cutting anything other than long rips, the blade guard will jump back against the wood you are holding once the sawed piece (on the right) falls off. This is what causes problems-you have to force the saw forward again to get it through.I got this saw because I thought the blade left was a good thing for a right-hander. I still think it could be, but the blade guard needs to be designed differently.I still give this saw three stars, because other than the guard issue, I liked it. Of all circular saws it felt the best in my hand and I know PC makes good tools. I'm sure the blade right model is a great saw, although I ended up going with a different saw-with a brake."
3,"Overpriced, poor quality","After researching my options, I selected this saw for several reasons. I liked the way it felt, I had used the 325 before, I have several other tools from Porter-Cable and it received top rating from Fine Homebuilding in 2004(?).After using it to cut 10 boards, the blade clamp self destructed. The saw blade that came with it has dished and hits the guard. The sight does not track with the blade.I did buy the saw locally and it is under warranty, but I am now on my third blade clamp in less than two weeks (partially because it took 1 week to receive the replacement). Traditional, bolt-style blade clamps are available [...], which I will surely be buying. I really don't know what else will go wrong once I get to use it.I bought a HD77M to replace it, no problems with that."
2,Stripped quick change bolt,"Do not buy. It's a nice saw, but the quick change bolt strips easily, and the repair shop near me is unable to fix it. Cheap part, expensive failure."
2,Won't cut straight,"I don't understand how it can be this way, but...I just can't get the saw to follow a straight line. I've used lots of circular saws without this problem. A friend in the trades tried it (to show me it DID cut straight, it wasn't the saw, and make fun of me) but had the same problem. It pulls to the left!"
4,No More Boring Veggies!,"This was a great choice because it shows you how to make healthy vegetarian meals that are not boring. The meals are delicious, colorful and healthy. I do not think I would of put together any of the recipes without the help of this book."
5,Fantastic!,"I love the recipes in this cookbook, especially the veg-head chili! I would definitely recommend this book to my friends and family!"
2,disappointing,"I'm not that familiar with Rachael Ray, so maybe it was my mistake, but I found the cookbook to be really disappointing. It's mostly pasta, soups, and salads. Very few recipes just of vegetables. None with tofu. Many of them require cheese. I can believe that the dishes only take 30 minutes to make and that they're all vegetarian, but they're not necessarily very healthy and the book lacks variety."
4,Thanks Rachel Ray,"I have previously read many of Rachel Ray's cook books and had always wished there was one with more vegetarian recipes. Well, this one is just that. Simple, 30 minute meals that taste great and are easy to make."
4,Not bad,I've enjoyed this cookbook since receiving it. It's very simple prep and mostly everyday products which are easy to come by. Written in true Rachael Ray fashion.
2,good for non-vegetarians only,"I'd recommend this for people who don't know what to feed their vegetarian guests.The book is unhelpful for most vegetarians. The book's not bad, but it's not very good either. Ms. Ray doesn't offer much in the way of ingredient substitution suggestions or interesting commentary, and the number of truly interesting recipes is very limited for the money, especially if one's been cooking vegetarian for a while. The recipes also tend to call for a lot of ingredients one doesn't have on hand. (The soups are quite good, and some of the supper snacks are interesting, but she leans too much on risottos and pasta for main dishes.)Rose Elliot's ""Vegetarian Fast Food"" has only 4 main ingredients per recipe, keeps her recipes short, offers ingredient substitution suggestions, and offers interesting commentary on most of her recipes. Christine Ingram's ""Vegetarian and Vegetable Cooking"" has an amazing number of recipes, some very simple and tasty."
5,Elis is a goddess,"We bought this CD in Japan and listened to it everyday for the next year. The only other reviewer of this disc should have listened past the first two songs and should have had a Japanese friend read him the liner notes that explain the poor quality of the original recordings on these (and only these) songs. They were taken from a live album recorded in Sao Paulo when she was 20 years old (and they're still great despite the distortion). The CD samples three or four songs off some of Elis's best recordings, including Elis & Tom, Aquarela Do Brasil and Elis Regina in London. I haven't seen a better compilation of her music. In short, this CD kicks buttock and it is a travesty that the only review (to this point) gives it one star. The price tag through Amazon is a bit steep, but if you're ever in Japan you can pick it up at a Tower Records for about 20 bucks."
5,SONGBIRD REGINA,"One of Elis's best compilation albums, every track is great. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
3,Over priced Japanese Import,"This C.D. has a live chirpy kind of upbeat fell to it. I too agree with the first reviewer in that the first few songs aren't of a very high quality. Why couldn't they have chosen something better? I have to skip the first 6 songs but from there it does get better. This set of songs has a generous playing time of 80 minutes, but for the extravagant price it should have been excellent throughout. Elis' carrer lasted for a number of years and numerous recordings. There still are quiet a few good songs. The recording quality is up to the high Japanese standards."
1,Worse than amateur,"I ordered this from an Amazon[.com] competitor, and was horrified by the distortion in the recording, at moderate volume levels. A replacement didn't sound any better, so it may be the recording. The first two tracks were awful. I didn't listen beyond them. A lot of amaterur recordings would sound better than this from: Universal International, a UNIVERSAL MUSIC COMPANY, marketed by Victor Entertainment, Inc."
4,Its Gladware,What can I say its gladware but you get a lot in the amazon package (6 sets of 3) for a very competitive price. Definitely recommend just ensure you get the type you will use most often as the sets are exactly the same you don't get a variety as you might in a grocery setting. Definitely recommend.
4,Drops of Corruption,Jason Hardy does a great job in his first contribution to the Shadow Run series.His unique twists make Drops of Corruption a must read even for the passive Shadow Run fan.
2,Very little Shadowrun here,"I am a huge fan of Shadowrun. Have all the books and have read many of them more then once. As a result, I had this book pre-ordered as soon as I heard about it.Many of the other books are about successful runners or beginners that become successful. This story started with an interesting idea: A successful runners that had fallen and was now living at the bottom.Unfortunately, it had very little to do with the Shadowrun universe. The items that make this story setting unique are missing. Very little magic used, almost zero cyberware and very little matrix running. 90% of this story could have easily happened in modern day.The funny thing is, the author claims to have done research into SR yet seems to have missed the whole essence of what makes this setting interesting.Overall I am disappointed. As a die hard fan I would still buy this book for no other reason then to show demand for Shadowrun products, but if I could do it again I would leave the book on a shelf unread."
4,A dream book,"In planning the vacation home we hope to have soon, we bought this book and a new one called SECOND HOME. Adirondack Style is more of a dream book and includes historical information about the style. It's also limited to one style, of course. The book called Second Home works on a couple levels as a dream book but it also includes information on shopping, building, decorating, and so on, and it shows a wide range of second home styles around the country. We like both, but if we had to pick only one, it would be Second Home. (A book called Cabin Fever is fun, too, but limited to very rustic styles.)"
4,A nice look at one style,"As I just wrote in a review of Cabin Fever, this book, too, is a delight to look at. But it is limited (as its title says, of course) to one style that is a bit more rustic than what we have in mind. Still, this is a lovely book to peruse. As we gather information on vacation homes, our favorite book is a new one called Second Home, which includes visits to everything from oceanside homes and lake cottages to mountain cabins. Second Home also includes information on how to shop for a second home, how to decide what location is right, and tips on building, decorating and so on. I've never met a vacation house book I didn't like, and I like them all. But Second Home is our favorite because it has such variety of home styles and helpful tips in it."
3,Handsome but limited,"In looking for ideas for the second home getaway we are planning, I came across this book and added it to my collection. It is handsome but, as the title would suggest, limited to one style. If that is your thing, fine. In this genre, the book that keeps rising to the top of the little stack on my coffee table is called SECOND HOME/Finding Your place in the Sun (or Fun or something like that). Second Home shows rustic styles and romantic cottage ones, too, taking me on a little tour of the United States as I turn the pages. The author obviously did his homework, too, because Second Home is filled with information on how to shop for real estate, evalute an area, decide what you want (and where you want it), etc."
1,Left in the lurch,"The Tekton Plaza Girder and Panel building set seemed a brilliant choice for my son. However, upon arrival, the set was strewn about the box and most of the building pieces were missing. Customer Service at Bridge Street Toys said they couldn't help me and referred me to the manufacturer. Customer Service at the manufacturer said she would have to get back to me and sounded skeptical that such a problem could occur. After a few days, she assured me that the missing pieces would arrive in time for Christmas. We received nothing and have heard nothing. I've given up and have since ordered the set from another toy company. We're awaiting delivery. I anticipate that my son will love the building set but my review reflects my exceedingly unsatisfactory treatment. I don't know who was ultimately responsible for the poor service and lack of responsiveness but others buying products from this company, take heed."
3,Disappointed with the windows and doors,"My expectations must have been too high. My son LOVES construction/building sets of all kinds. The Girder and panels are great, but the windows and doors are merely made of vinyl film strips, like the old 35mm camera film. If they made the windows and doors out of plastic, I could recommend this toy, but I can't suggest buying this item the way it is now. He assembled a building once, and never touched it again. He's back to the old reliable building toys we've purchased elsewhere. It's okay, but not great. I wouldn't purchase it again, and not going to expand this collection at all. I do not recommend. Sorry."
4,Excellent product with One Major Problem,"I searched for this product many years. When I was a boy (the '50' & 60's) this toy was prized by children and I spent many hours of my childhood building things using the girder and panel building set. I had a great wish to locate this for my two grandchildren now that I am a grandfather. They love toys like the old-fashioned Tinker Toys and Erector Sets. I was elated when I found this on Amazon. One complaint. Many of the holes on the panels that allow you to snap them onto the girders are not punched out. This truly takes away from the satisfaction of building and rebuilding when one has inspiration and ideas to build. It is very frustrating. Mostly, the item is excellent. Just the one major problem on the one I was sent."
2,OKAY...,"The dial part of the watch stands quite far off of your wrist -- makes it look a little odd. The band, however, is really nice and I liked the clasping feature."
4,Sort of a grab bag,This compilation covers about the whole range of Bennett. The first disk is the typical NYC big orchestra with too much reverb on Tony faire. None-the-less enjoyable. The bulk of material came from a 1975 album. The 2nd CD is a more intimate NYC studio session with the Ruby Braff/George Barnes Quartet. Very nice. The 3rd CD and the 1st half of the 4th CD is the Bill Evans/Tony - Together Again album. It includes all the original cuts plus a couple of alternates of each cut. Sublime is the best way to describe these CD. The mastering is bit better on this CD than earlier releases. The last half of the 4h CD is sort of strange yet fun date Tony had in Buffalo. Buffalo? Bennett is backed by Marian and Jimmy McPartland and their band. The rhythm section is great (Charlie Byrd on guitar) but the horns sometimes sound like a clown band. I think maybe they were trying to do Dixieland but it sounded more like clown music. Fun nonetheless.Sort of a weird compilation but I enjoyed it.
3,A bit disappointed,"After 10 years of hard use, including 8 trips to Mexico, the binding of my first edition of this dictionary was beginning to get loose. It has been a thoroughly satisfying book so I bought the new 3rd edition and within the first year the binding is already coming apart. This is a big book and needs to be really well put together to stand up. Unfortunately it is not built strong enough and clearly will not last like the old one has."
4,Dictionary/CD-ROM,"I purchased the dictionary/CD-ROM package and have been very impressed. The CD-ROM does not need the CD every time and is very easy to search. It is NOT a translator, so you need to know every base/root word. It also doesn't have phrases, for example you have to look up ""qué"" and look through all the meanings to find ""qué tal."" If the program is open, you can also double click any word anywhere (web page, document, etc.) and it will go to that word in the dictionary.The book contains everything imaginable, and I haven't been through all of it. It even has internet lingo in Spanish. I have found myself using the CD much more than the actual dictionary. The CD by itself is fine on it's own, but only for $15 more or so I bought the hard copy dictionary just in case. Great product."
1,Sloppy workmanship,This Dictionary was everything it was supposed to be but the back cover tore off the second time I opened it. Cost to much to send back but I wanted others to know.Richard Pleger
5,Excellent Rock Albumn!,Soundgarden meets Freddie Mercury is what describes this guy's voice. One of the best rock bands I've seen or heard for many years!!
1,Meh...,"Compared to ""Holiday man"" I didn't like this album.But I didn't give it too much of a chance before I sold my cd collection..."
3,Not of the same quality as whole bean Cool Beans coffee,"I have bought whole bean Cool Beans coffee in the past and loved it. The flavor is great. However, these pods did not have the same great flavor. I expected a little loss of flavor because of the nature of pods, but these brewed a fairly weak cup of coffee without a lot of flavor. It wasn't bad, just not up to my expectations from other Cool Beans products."
5,A handy intro for the uninitiated landsman,"I purchased this book on the strength of a recommendation from a review in the Block Island, R.I. local paper (much of the book involves settings in the Block Island locale). As one with minimal experience with fishing and the sea, but a modest interest in both, I found the book provides a well-paced intro to all aspects of the world of the fisherman, both commercial and recreational. The author leavens the book with a number of human-interest stories, and his limited excursions into non-fishing matters (politics for example) are stimulating."
4,Rational or rationale,"Cheryl Hall's book opened up avenues in my attempts to establish a democratic value for imperfect, everyday conversation and disagreement. Most of these seemed a long way away from the demanding ideals of ""rational critical debate"" in the public sphere. This book allowed for an alternative perspective, restoring passion to some degree of legitimacy. What was a little frustrating was a somewhat fuzzy conflating of eros, passion and sentiment - but that may just have been my failure to descriminate."
2,Not too exciting,"I purchased several of these books from this author and my boys were never interested in them. The illustrations are simple, fabric, pictures and they are not very interesting. The price is inexpensive, however, but I'd buy something else."
4,Great addition to your Spanish library,"This brightly colored book is great to use as an addition to a Spanish curriculum.The sturdy pages continue to wow my classes of ages 3 all the way to 14 years old. If you'd like to introduce your child to Spanish, I might choose an animal, colors, or shapes book before this one, and you might want to get something they can WRITE on or color rather than just look at.Overall, I think it's great to know ANY word (especially toys, which are everywhere!) when you're trying to introduce a second language to your child. It's a big endeavor, and this book helps!Sra. GoseAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 & Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 2"
4,Blind shrimp???,"Having had the oppurtunity to hear Happy Family several times in the packed living room of New Guild Co-op in Austin, Texas, I gotta say, this is one cool album. You haven't lived until you've heard ""Big Ass on Fire.""-----""Call the foreign legion. It's perverting the region. Burning ever burning but it never is consumed."" I don't know what kind of music this is, maybe the closest you can say is that it's like X on even more drugs. Whatever it is, it's a great time and it documents one of the coolest (yet hottest) summers of my life. Way cool. Rock on, Cindy."
3,Toddler relates to this book,"This is another book that I would have rated one star less if it were purely up to me, but my toddler's enthusiastic reception of it elevates it from a ""poor"" book to a ""pretty good"" one. Simple text and pictures depict children engaged in activities toddlers relate to: playing in water, knocking over blocks, playing dress up, etc. While it may not be a masterpiece in my estimation, it is a fun and interactive book, very suitable for toddlers."
3,"Light on mystery, heavy on drama","This is the first Sister Joan mystery I have read, and it likely won't be the last. It appeared to me, however, that the meat of the mystery story took a backseat to other issues, namely Catholic/Protestant relations in a small Scottish town and how Sister Joan got along with various townspeople and the monks of a nearby monastery. The issue of the legendary ""Black Morag"" was, I thought, a bit silly, but necessary to introduce the clandestine romance between two young people, which the Sister Joan eventually discovers.As a novel, ""Sanctity"" is a good read and does offer enough suspenseful action to keep a mystery fan occupied."
4,Allan Clarke,"Allan Clarke's second, third, and fourth albums compilation is pretty wonderful! Though Clarke's solo works didn't have too many hits, it's still great to listen to especially since he's one of those people who have that distinctive voice. Many people do not listen to Clarke as much because they like The Hollies better (frankly, I like The Hollies better as well), but his solo works are worth listening to!"
1,Allan flops on his own,"Allan Clarke's second, third, and fourth solo albums suffer from the dreaded ""bland"" syndrome of solo singers attempting to break out of the group mold, with generic production of the ""serious"" kind; in other words, boring. In the case of Allan Clarke, his talents were always best within the confines of The Hollies, even during the band's lean years in the late '70s, when Clarke slipped in and out of the band whenever he felt like it. These solos recordings are not bad, just lacking in the charm and appeal of his best work with The Hollies. You're left asking yourself why you bothered, when listening to The Hollies is so much more enjoyable."
5,16 gauge titanium CBR,"Beautiful piece of jewelry, I never take it out... except for job interviews :) I've had issues before with jewelry claiming to be titanium but ending up causing allergic reactions, but this is perfect."
5,a sweet little book,"This is perfect for a girl's first slumber party, it has recipes and fun craft ideas, the tone is light and easy for an 8 year old to read on her own and feel like she's throwing her own party. I really love this writer's books, always nice!"
1,"Narrow focus, possibly misleading information.","The book is a primitively produced 'text' on installing radiant floor heating in new constuction using copper tubing embedded in a concrete slab. The book features type-written, photocopied pages; amateur, hand-drawn illustrations; and home-made covers. The pages are bound using some type of do-it-yourself manual binding machine. My copy was missing page 36.The content is narrowly focused on copper embedded in concrete. The subjects of other materials, installations in existing structures, or installation in structures other those using concrete slabs are mentioned only in the most tangental manner.In addition, reports of copper catastrophically (at least financially) corroding away when embedded in concrete abound, although this reader has had no personal experiences with copper in concrete. But the author's actual experience with radiant floor heating seems so limited I find it hard to have any confidence in his recommendations."
4,Excellent how-to guide,"I have a previous version of the author's book and was pleased to see that the latest edition is even better. Following the authors guidelines, I have completed a sucessful radiant heat system for my home. The authors suggestions and detailed descriptions provide much help in the actual layout and selection of materials. I would recommend this book to anyone who is considering a radiant heating system in their home."
1,An engineer's view,"I felt the material included in this book was not useful and in some cases, very questionable. I would not buy it again and do not feel that it was useful."
1,CD Stomper software a bust!,"I purchased the CD Stomper software over 6 weeks ago and have not been able to get it to work properly on my Win XP system. The tech support number is long distance, only M-F, and the staff is unreliable. I was told a new version would correct my problem and after waiting 4 weeks, the new version still would not work. Now, the patch to correct this problem will be out soon they tell me. YIKES!"
3,"GoOd PrOdUCt, Bad SoFtWaRe!",hi. i just got my cd stomper! it works fine. bit the only thing that doesn't work good is the software that comes with it. if i was you i would go out and buy a different software to make labels.
3,"Cool, but...","...the software could be better. I have done a lot of desktop publishing and work with graphics programs, and the software for CD Stomper is not very easy to use. I also tried to buy additional labels at local stores, and couldn't find any labels by Stomp. So I bought another brand with the same layout, but found that their measurements are different.If the Stomp software could accommodate other labelling brands, and add more functionality, this would be a terrific product. Otherwise, you may want to investigate other CD labelling brands, as they all do the same stuff."
1,CD Stomp Label maker,"Prior to Avery taking over this wonderful labeling system it was the best around.The new paper sheet system gets stuck in my printer and I have three of them (printers), I wish that they would have left ""greatness"" alone and just changed the product name.This new system is totally unreliable and from time to time useless.Mitch Zorich"
5,All band students and alums should read this book,"Kerstin has compiled a wonderful book that is more than ""just"" the history of the UMMB. The book (especially the photos) captures the true experience of being a member of this amazing organization. Current members or alums of a high school or college marching band can relate to the stories. The book can easily hold the attention of anyone interested in history, education, and/or music (and anyone who has participated in a Drum Major Academy/Band Leadership Training seminar). The Power and Class of New England is a truly unique group defined by its history, with its excellence maintained and improved upon year after year by the band members and incredible staff.Lisa M., Clarinet/T-bone UMMB, 1989-1993"
5,Amazing,"This book is about the most inspiring part of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Minuteman Marching Band. Unless you have attended a football game in the past you have not witnessed the Power and Class of New England. At my first football game I was astonished when I saw more people in the stands during the half time show than were present for the entire game. The history of the band is quite amazing and is a story to be enjoyed by all. From the 4:40 practices to sleeping on gym floors the dedication and pride shown by the members of this organization should be enjoyed by all. Two enthusiastic thumbs up, way to go Kerstin."
2,This is not a child themed book!,"This is a lovely book with gorgeous illustrations and I'm sure that I've seen a film with a similar theme, but kidnapping, blackmail, hostages are not child-centered themes for picture books! What are we trying to teach our daughters? That being forced into a relationship for years against our wills is okay? This book was sorta creepy to me, but I love the idea of the seals dancing on midsummer's eve"
3,quick read,I received this book as a gift. It's a quick read with some parenting advice and food for thought. Good for a one-time read. Not something I'd hang on to and certainly not worth the list price on the back cover.
3,Coffee table read,"This is a sweet book written by the author/photographer. It's short, sweet and simple. An ideal sweet gift for a Dad, and idea for your coffee table."
4,"Nuclear fallout, Rave scenes from hell and of course, The End of the World","These are just a few of the broad topics covered by Jeremy Robert Johnson's excellent collection of short stories. Each story has a different feel, but they are all well-written, and take the reader through a range of emotions in a few short pages.Jeremy Robert Johnson's stories are very strange, but they are all easy to follow, unlike other ""Bizarro"" authors such as Carlton Mellick III, whose writing style itself is just bizarro. JRJ's writing style is concrete and fresh, each story a separate entity with its own set of rules, which makes for a wonderfully entertaining read.He mentions such authors as Palahniuk, Selby, Ellis, and others as giving him inspirations for writing. These three are some of my favorite authors as well, and JRJ will most likely be added to that list once his novel is released."
4,HIGHLY READABLE STRANGENESS,"I've had the pleasure of meeting this author at a reading, and I can say with some visceral level of confidence that he is an immensely intelligent guy. Also weird--and twistedly funny. I think all these aspects figure very naturally into his writing. This is not a mainstream work of word pablum. It's not the all-loose-ends tied up product of an essentially finished and dead at heart artist living in Lower Manhattan on yesterday's glory. It's the work of someone whose wings are still wet and claws sharpening. Emerging, luminous and potentially dangerous fiction. As I ask my smart friends, why wouldn't you want to read this? Ya scared?"
5,Bizarro at it's best,"I have a decent library of about 25 bizarro books, and this is probably the best out of a bunch of bests.As an avid short story fan, the stories presented here tickle me in all of the right places with their unique personalities. Personal favorites include ""Disassociative Skills,"" ""Snowfall,"" ""Luminary,"" ""Saturn's Game"" and the ""Wall of Sound"" novella.While I do enjoy most of the bizarro I've read, I tend to enjoy the ""softcore"" side of it, and this collection delivers just that. A big brother who's philosophical and glows with bioluminensence. Doped up teenagers cutting themselves open. Weird, but not overly so. Mellick and the like have their place in my heart, but Johnson has truly won me over."
5,"Strange, Different, Weird and Horrific.","Jeremy Robert Johnson's name even sounds like a serial killer. His writing is like Burrough's Naked Lunch on twenty-hits of acid and nuclear bong hits: this dude can write.The writing isn't bizzare to the point that you think he's trying too hard and he makes it flow nice and smooth while conjuring the strangest visions in your mind while reading these stories.I term this Surreal Horror, to me at least, and good enough that I went right out and ordered a copy of Siren Promised. I plan on reading everything this guy has to offer.I haven't read Carlton Mellick yet, and can't compare, but if you want something different, well written, that will buzz your head and make you think at the same time, then try these stories.Thumbs-up to Morten Bak, the artist responsible for the killer artwork on the cover: defintely the kind of book you prop up somewhere where you can gaze into the cover after reading it.Five stars!"
2,Its just so so,"Its a good beach book or something of that nature. The writing is mediocre as are the stories. Its not aweful, but you won't be moved very much or wowed or what have you."
1,Amateurish and derivative,"I'm surprised this book has so many 5-star reviews here. In fact I'm surprised this book was published at all. The writer is full of himself, to the point where he actually waxes philosophical at the end and offers tidbits of insight on each little stinker in this book. Fittingly, I read the entire thing on the toilet. The best advice I can give here to someone interested in this is that in the beginning of the book, the author dedicates his work to Rand, Selby, Wallace, Burroughs, Vonnegut, Welsh, Williams, Palahniuk, Barker, King and Elroy. Read them instead of this. They will indeed show you what words can do."
5,The end is at hand.,"Jeremy Robert Johnson is not going to take you to a happy place. In his collection of short fiction, ""Angeldust Apocalypse"" the reader is taken for a ride into a world that's broken and screwed up and yet, you enjoy it anyway. Each story is well written, well placed in the collection. None disappoint. These stories are drug crazed, death crazed and simply crazed. Fans of the bizarre will enjoy this collection very much. This is a good first taste of Mr. Johnson's writing. If this collection is any indicator what's to come will be even better. Physically the book also presents well. Easily readible type, fantastic cover art by Morten Bak. And the ever tempting promise of new works by Mr. Johnson. All in all a good read and worthy buy."
5,Great Short Stories,"I bought this book reluctantly, because I am not fond of short stories. I am more of a novel reader. However, I was amazed at these short stories. What struck me was what Jeremy Robert Johnson knew what not to write. His stories didn't seem different for the sake of being different. He didn't hype up the drug references or any kind of gore. The stories were just good short stories that showed a different world that one could see happen.I am jealous of this writer."
4,The first excellent short story writer of my generation,"This book is a sustained psychoanalysis of the generation born between 1972 and 1980. He takes our anxieties, spins them into nightmares, force-feeds them back to us, and makes it look effortless. As such, he has drawn comparisons to Burroughs, but this can be misleading - the similarity is thematic and not stylistic. As odd as it may sound, Johnson's brevity and clarity reminds me of O. Henry. These are perfectly-edited little hand grenades.My favorite in this collection is second story (""Dissasociative Skills""). If I'm not mistaken, Johnson is riffing on ""Patriotism,"" Yukio Mishima's masterpiece short story about hara-kiri. If Mishima's story is a study in aesthetic nihilism and physical ecstasy, Johnson supplants it with AN-aesthetic nihilism and suburban torpor.Of course, for me, the body-horror thing gets a bit overwhelming for me at times. This guy has a wonderful mind, and I'd love to see him write something other than ""dark"" fiction."
4,great artist - great cd,"I had never heard of Jason Aldean until I heard ""Johnny Cash"" on CMT. Wow, I was missing a great talent! The title song is just incredible!"
2,"Aldean Not ""All That""","Another diminutive overrated Country singer in the model of the #1 overrated -- Kenny Chesney. Why do these small guys with only moderate talent get signed to major label record deals and become ""stars""? It kind of boggles the mind. There HAS to be more talented and more interesting male singers out there than this. Listen to Aldean try to sound sincere while fighting sinus problems in ""Laughed Until We Cried"". And watch ... that will be a HUGE hit with radio stations following their orders. You just scratch your head, laugh, and start heading for Austin, I guess.""The worst singer I've ever seenWas some short guy named Jason AldeanIn a cowboy hatMan, I laughed at thatThe little dude thought he could singSporting a couple of ladies earringsLooking like some bratWith a voice so flatOh, man, he was willingBut my ears, he was killingThe Chesney legacy has no prideI laughed until I cried"""
4,Good CD,Jason Aldean has great music and this CD has some really good songs on it. I do think the music in his first CD was much better. A lot of the songs on the new CD are slow to me.
5,Better than I expected!,I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed many of the tracks as much as the ones I hear on the radio.
4,A Splendid Little Story of the Splendid Little War,"This book is the real deal. It's a story Spanish-American War from a real participant's view, instead of some long-winded pseudo-intellectual pedagogue.Unlike the more famous [and high ranking] participants, such as Theodore Roosevelt and George Dewey, who wrote about their exploits, Charles Johnson Post was a private. He was a combat veteran who successfully dodged Spanish bullets and survived the Cuban campaign only to nearly die in the horrific quarentine camp which awaited the returning soldiers.Not only did Mr. Post write a great story, but illustrated the scenes of the war.My reason for not rating this a 5 is that there were not enough of Mr.Post's artwork and for printing copies of his water colors in B&W;!"
2,What a disappointment!,"How anyone could take the most facinating subjects in the world (the Nicholas Brothers) and make it dull, dead, BORING is beyond me! But this author has done it. I hope she has another career goal, because her writing is just awful and she conveys NO excitement, fun or even history. She glosses over Fayard & Harold's actual history and instead focuses on describing each tap step of each routine--and even to me, as a tap dancer, DULL! I want to hear their stories, for goodness' sake. I KNOW their dancing!"
5,Superior and Detailed Account,"Eldon Hall has done something rare with this book. He has taken a very complex subject, nearly forgotten due to time, and made it utterly relevant and engaging. For anyone with an interest in either space or computer history, this is a vital book.It is somewhat technical (I had no idea how they made rope memory modules, an early ROM format before this book for instance), but Hall is very careful to explain things in terms that an average reader can readily understand.The book itself documents the Apollo Guidance Computer from conception through numerous iterations and changes, to final successful lunar landings. Although the AGC capabilities seem trivial today, the AGC was the world's first Integrated Chip computer, and had enormous hurdles to overcome. In the end, of course, we know that Hall and his fellow employees at MIT did a good job...what I didn't know before was exactly what they had to do and the challenges they had to overcome."
