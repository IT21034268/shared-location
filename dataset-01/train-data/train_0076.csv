5,keds,Love them have been wearing Keds for yearsand they never let me down. My 10yr old daughter also loves hers.
3,Keds shoes- not what I expected,did not wash well... price was great but doesn't seem like the same Keds that you buy in dept stores. Not real happy with them.
2,Long and narrow.,I purchased a pair size 7 1/2. The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes. These shoes are very narrow.
5,Shoes,Purchased these for my 75 year old sister who had been looking and looking for some navy keds. She loves them.
2,Runs small!,"I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on, they hurt my feet. They are extremely narrow - returned right away."
1,Quality is lacking,"I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time, but needed to replace. I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality. I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart. They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take. I will be replacing these, but will not purchase another Keds shoe."
1,Terrible Quality,I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart. To late too return them now so it was a waste of money. Very disappointed in the quality. I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality. Will not buy this brand again.
3,Keds women's champion sneaker,"I purchased this tennis shoe for my 87 yr old mother as she wanted a pair like the ones Ked's made 25 years or more ago. The shoes arrived very fast in the mail to her, but the rubber sole much thicker, not like the ones originally made by Keds. Also, she is always a size 9.5 narrow, this is the size I ordered, but they were too short. If she kept them she would have had to have a size 10. Unfortunately, these shoes are made in China,so who knows what you are going to get. Why don't we have these shoes made in the USA where then the size would be correct?"
4,Women's Keds,I really like the Keds sneakers.. I ordered Navy and they look black. I would order again but in another color.
3,"Keds Women's Champion Sneakers, not great","This type of sneaker is not a durable quality sneaker at all. I have purchased at tag sales old Ked's sneakers for $3-$5 dollars which were much more durable. I save this pair purchased for going out on business trips or the like since this type of Ked's sneakers wouldn't last a week with my daily work chores, sad to say."
1,Navy blue Ked shoes,These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue. The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received. I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds. Very disappointing.
2,Not so washable,"The shoes were an amazing fit, but when I washed them--in cold water, I might add--the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas. Perhaps, it will wash away next time, but I was more than miffed."
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!!,"Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight, it has a bluish tinge to it. The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway....i.e., the inside is merely the raw cut. The first time I washed them (in cold water), the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper. Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker....I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence. Very sad indeed."
1,Color makes a difference in what shoe you get.,"I wasn't looking for a good walking shoe, just a specific look; (surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers). Since newer reviews seemed generally positive, I thought I would take a shot. Unfortunately, these aren't acceptable even for light use. Very tight and feel like cardboard. Note: I purchased the navy. The description says ""soft terry lining"" which these don't have. BUT if you look at the different colors shown you will see that some colors DO have a terry lining (red for example) while others (navy, black, denim) clearly don't. I am assuming that the positive reviews are for those colors constructed as described. Sending these back."
1,Mislabeled,"I have worn Keds sneakers for many years, always ordering size 6.5.The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5, but this sneaker is at most size 5, or it is a child's sneaker.Very disappointed."
5,"Total satisfaction, works perfectly, everything ok, this product its ok, and it can be recommended for others users without doub","Total satisfaction, works perfectly, everything ok, this product its ok, and it can be recommended for others users without doubt"
4,Keds black sneaker,Love the black lower edge color. I have a couple sore spots after wearing all day. The past keds fit a little better. Wonderful shoes otherwise.
3,A classic -- but they run a little small,"The Keds sneaker is a classic, same style as always, and worn by everyone. I was surprised, however, that they tend to run a little small! My foot is between 9.5 and 10 in size, so I bought 10, and I can't wear them with socks. I am trying to stretch them with shoe trees in hopes of being able to wear them more often. I have to say, that's a little disappointing."
4,Wrong Size,"I previously had the same Keds sneaker. Liked them. Ordered a medium width, not a wide width. Had to return them."
5,comfortable and lite sneakers,Product arrived as promised and in good condition. Great shoes for around the house without the weight of the heavy athletic shoes.
3,Keds Oxford,"Not what I wanted, but I didn't have an inside label picture of the inside label which makes a difference when buying Keds. I took a chance and from now on will look for the ""correct"" label. Not all Keds are created equal, some have more support, better fitting; this shoe isn't one of them, but for messing around in the back yard, they are okay. For long time wear, spend more."
2,Average,These shoes are not as good as they used to be. Very little support. The sole is very thin. Definetly not worth the price.
1,Had to return!!,Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit. As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return!!
2,keds womens champion sneaker,the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
2,Wrong display picture!,"Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe. Also in another picture, the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside. They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before."
2,Sent the wrong color,"I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds. In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones. Also, I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet, but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me. I can't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny. So be warned. I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived. I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered."
5,Awesome,The one thing I was worried about was in the description it did not say about subtitles. The movie is in japanese and has english dubbing as well as english sub titles.
3,They took the heroism of the girl away!,"It deserves 2 stars, (but I only give it 3 because I am a Die Hard L fan.) If you liked reading/watchign Death Note to route for Light, you would be sad to find him not in this picture.The book was better.The movie was sexist. Why is it the female (girl) who has to make mistakes and be corrected and ""saved"" by the male hero? In the book, the girl was the heroine who brought the villianess to repent her ways. This movie brings a boy (Near) to take her place."
2,Not good.,Definitely not as good as the book nor anime. Has a bit of a different storyline than the book.
5,Love this movie !!!,I was so happy I got it I wanted to watch it for a long time and I'm a huge death note fan and the movie was great so everything was awesome :)
5,Very Much Love This Movie,"I love all three parts the acting is great and the story line is awesome. You must buy these three movies. And Ken'ichi Matsuyama - the guy who plays the character L in all three parts - is so unbelievably beautiful, it's aching (like I just want to reach through the screen and...) I really envy the person who steals his heart."
2,5 star thriller,"As a Jack Reacher fan, Lee Childs continues to impress the reader with great story telling ability and always provides outstanding technical information."
2,It's Okay!,"Well, I read it but it was tough to finish. John Culbertson certainly admires the 5th Marine snipers but they weren't the saviors that he makes them out to be."
2,Disapointing,"This book seemed to me to be a platform to fire off complaints and accusations at other more famous snipers in Vietnam than anything else. I understand that there were other snipers served in Vietnam, just tell the story and leave it at that. Don't make your story your personal soap box against the government and Carlos Hathcock. There was some good story in here, that is the only reason I give it two stars instead of one. I don't reccomend this one."
1,Propoganda and hearsay,"I purchased this book thinking that it would give me either:a) a personal glimpse into the world of the Marine Sniperb) a report of stories and circumstances of the Marine Sniper from an objective source.The book offered neither of these. It appears Culbertson is writing from the perspective of one who was there, but had little involvement. He speaks at the beginning of the book, of a get together with some of his sniper buddies many years after the war. One gets the impression this book was written as a result of this get together. I would like so much to have read about the authors experiences rather than much of the politicialy commentary and Marine propaganda that the book expounds upon. The book really taught me nothing about what these men went through. It represents the vague recollections of the author's and other experiences. Not enough meat in it for my liking."
1,Another opinionated book by this author,"Here we have yet another book by Culbertson. It's poorly written, has a tendency to jump around, and is, basically, a biography of this man's lover, Tom Casey. It's sad, really, how much this author tries to make a martyr out of Casey. As a sniper in the U.S. Army, I've read just about every book about snipers, and this book, along with SHOOTER by Jack Coughlin are by far the worst written. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
4,Truth wins in this Book,This Book is a no-nonsense story of what it was like to be a scout\sniper in the 5th Marines in 1967-68. The Author was there and gives the Reader the feeling of being there too. The Book also attempts to dispel some of the outrageous myths and stories about Snipers in the Nam. Every War has both its authentic Heroes and its phony Legends. Vietnam was no different. This book has a lot of Truth in it and if that is what you are looking for it is a must read. I would have given it 5 stars if the writing had been better. The run-on sentences and the skipping around in the story line took away from the overall rating of the book.
5,the truth will set you free,"Culbertsons book is a military club best seller because it shines the light of truth on much of the exaggerations and out right lies that have come out of the vietnam war. When Culbertson speaks of himself in combat action with the rest of his fifth marine buddys he is using a writing technique called a ""flashback"" . many combat veterans see past events like a movie where they view themselves merely as a participant. The reason many of the stories in the book seem disjointed is because each sniper team operated with different units in different places during the same time period. This is the most technically accurate portrayal of the Fifth marines in Vietnam that exists. This book also contains the names of operations , list of snipers, and battles that were led by specific officers . Check out the usmc history annals on these events and you too may learn the truth about Vietnam."
1,"Poorly written, bitter, amateurish","John Culbertson is a novice writer who is so desperate to fill pages that he intentionally tells the same story twice; at the beginning and the middle of the book, because the story ""bears repeating."" He blethers on about hippies, Army Generals, The President, the Military-Industrial complex, college professors, the Army and Navy, REMF's, until he reaches the conclusion that himself and his close associates were the only true patriots in the war. The saddest part is that he has logged on to the Amazon review pages and gave his own book a 5-star review (check it out)."
2,not very intruiging,"I had a hard time finishing this book. It was very repetitive. Just simply two peoples accounts of the same incidents. It was only so so. The only thing I found to be of interest, was the mention of the Lake City Army Ammo plant here in Missouri."
2,a curious book,"I picked this up at the airport and read it quickly. Lightweight read, nothing deep. Generally poor writing, on what could have been an interesting and insightful series of events. The author repeats himself a few times and I got the impression the 'book' is a combination of a series of essays, often on the same topics/people/events. The author is in desperate need of a good editor and guidence. A fascinating theme but the result is disappointing. Nothing outstanding and full of the usual American fixations. Lacks historical depth and feels very one-dimensional. Still, it passed the time on the flight, which is all that one can ask of this genre."
3,Good good....,"I just finished this book and I have to say that it was very interesting and even suspenseful in some parts of the book. BUT, it was kind of hard to understand fully because there was a lot of confusion during the first 5 chapters or so. The rest of the book, however, is very well written and I think I would like to read other books concerning snipers in Vietnam."
5,Don't shy away...,"Don't shy away from this tool just because its made of Beech instead of rosewood. I have one of these and one similiar made by Lee Valley tools. Though not as pretty as the rosewood models, they are tougher than they look and work well. I have several marking gauges(I think 5), mainly because I tend to use the same dimensions a lot, so I have them set to the most common ones I use, with a couple to use with other stuff. Saves time and besides I like looking at em. HaHa. Every serious or want to be serious wood worker needs at least one of these. Much more accurate for layout than a pencil, especially for mortise/tenon, and dovetail joints. Highly recommend."
1,outdated info,"dont bother getting this guide. game and info are outdated. asherons call the original game is far superior to this sequel in character stats development, pvp, and world map."
1,This book is obsolete,"As of the June patch, when Crafting 2.0 was implemented, there is now no longer ANY part of this book that is helpful to those new to AC2. It's not the fault of the author or publisher... all the stuff has been changed, and very much for the better!If you are new to AC2 and want overview info and advice, you're best bet is to look at the fan websites: www.fallenkingdoms.com, ac2.warcry.com, and www.ac2hq.com. Turbine's AC2 site, ac2.turbinegames.com, has a lot of good advice as well.So save your money, don't buy this book... unless they put out a new, totally revised edition."
3,Good Effort,"This is probably the best of the Wishbone Ash albums made without Martin Turner. Word has it that Andy Powell set out to make a follow-up to the famed 1972 Argus album. He didn't succeed, but it's a decent effort and does have more Wishbone Ash feel than the other albums Powell has made under the Ash name."
3,just OK,"Wishbone Ash's classic era (the first 3 albums) had hints of metal, prog, and folk without really embracing any of these fully. They also combined nice harmony vocals and tasteful musicianship on every instrument. By the mid-70s, they seem to have scaled back on most of these elements that made them stand out, and become a rather bland, forgettable rock band. ""Illuminations"" claimed to be an ""Argus for the 90's"" (Argus being their third and most popular album). Sadly, it doesn't quite deliver. It's not bad, merely kind of forgettable - there's some nice bits here and there, but it doesn't really rock much or stray from mainstream (classic) rock enough to be memorable. The only other post-70's album I've heard by them, Bona Fide (from 2002 with an almost compelte different lineup) rocks a lot more, and while remaining in a general classic rock context, does it well."
3,Superb direction and acting,"First and foremost, I would like to appreciate the effort that has been put in by all the cast and crew of the film to make this film extremely watchable again and again and again...Secondly, the performance given by Ms. Shilpa Shetty is laudable. I mean, she is such a treat to watch on screen. Even Abhishk and Salman have put in a wonderful performance.Last but not the least, Revathi, the captain of the ship (sorry for using the cliché) has put in a lot of effort to make the film look simple, real, and stunning (at least to the Indian society). Of course, the mail plot of the film is inspired from the Hollywood flick Philadelphia. But the characterizations, screenplay are trailer-made for bollywood movie goers.Despite the fate of this film at the box-office, i recommend the film to all. Though there is another film ( My brother Nikhil) based on the same AIDS concept, i think, Phir.. is better."
5,This one takes you back!!,"I had no idea how far this CD would take me back! I'm just 25, so it only took me back to middle school, but I was so excited to hear all this wonderful music that they rarely play anymore. I can't even remember the last time I heard ""My Forever Love"", but it is so beautiful that it just may be my wedding song. It doesn't matter how many years have gone by, all of these tracks are still jamming! So many hits on one album. Definitely a party CD! Please pick this one up. You will NOT be disappointed!"
2,"Great subject, mediocre verbiage","Elizabeth The Queen Mother by Grania Forbes offers an array of photographs that are fun, but the writing is wretched. The author is one of these writers who begins every third sentence with However. And that gets really tedious, a sign of an insecure and inept writer. While there are some fine photos which cover, naturally, the entire 20th century (the subject was born in 1900 and still lives!) their chronology in this book is immensely flawed, as if seemingly by a mixmaster. You are led to believe it's chronological, then you are fooled to the point of aggravation."
3,A Royal life in pictures,"The biggest value of this book is it's photographs. The story is superficial, and tells little of historical interest about a woman whose life encompassed the entire 20th century and then some. It is best described as a 'coffee table book'. The written parts separating the photographs are rather sycophantic in tone, and not all that useful.If one wants a complete story of this woman (and she had a fascinating life) the Shawcross book ""The Queen Mother: the Official Biography"" is much better. But the photographs are really lovely, and many of them haven't been published before."
3,too many cooks,"four songwriters who also sing writing in all manner of tag teams with plenty of pop smarts, and solid playing, but way too clever and ultimately self defeating. great hooks are pushed aside by another hook, then another, then another until you forget if this was the same song.each song must have at least five parts, and there's no guarantee they'll be related. a killer melody followed by a silly one sung in an affected voice. all 10cc stuff is like this, very frustrating. it's impressive on many levels, but you won't play it thrice."
4,Against my expectations,"This record was a huge record for me - I loved the way it was crafted - tones, textures, syncopations. Scant weeks after I got this record, the rest of 1976 happened and dinosaurs like 10cc were put aside for more relevant and angry music. I've returned to this record (in my mind only) over the last few years, but only now did I break down and buy it. The remastering work is excellent, the songs still sound fresh, and there's much more of a Zappa/Beefheart thing going on than I ever realized back then. Who mentioned XTC? It's a good point, because there is a craftsmanship that went into their music that happens here also. There is a HUGE difference between good craftsmanship and tedious self-indulgence, and this record has remained on the good side of that fence.A big surprise, but a very welcome one."
3,"Great Games, but there is a better book out there","I think that most people would be better off with another book, ""Nezhmetdinov's Best Games of Chess."" For some reason Amazon.com doesn't carry this title, but it is available from other chess sites.Anyway, this guy's games are incredible, and very entertaining to play over."
4,Swiss watch without the price of a swiss watch,I'm a big Oris and Tag guy. I wasn't sure what to expect from this product but when it arrived I was extremely pleased. Great quality and craftsmanship. I will be purchasing another Invicta watch.
3,Chronograph watch,"The watch is simple, but specific with details. Heavy and not cheap, at least the material. However, it fails to glow at night or allow the owner to tell the time in dark locations."
3,Nice but can't see dial in the dark,Great watch. Cannot see the dial well in the dark. Instructions are vague.Dial is too cluttered. Runs great. Good price.
3,"Nice looking watch, but has problems","I own the Invicta 3913, and has been my daily wear for nearly 4 years now. Unfortunately, after about 1 year, the date stopped turning on this watch. I have tried playing with the crown for the date adjustment is controlled with one click out, and then a turn. However, the date function no longer turns. I have tried to contact Invicta support but received no response.Outside of this issue, I do enjoy wearing this watch. It looks nice and has held up to some pretty rough thrashing over the years. I am into some very active sports (snowboarding, mountain biking, etc.) and have a pretty aggressive approach to them. This watch is still ticking.3 stars because while I do enjoy wearing it, the date issue and Invicta's lack of response to me was disappointing."
4,3913 II Sport Watch- Invicta,"The watch is great and good looking, but the only thing my husband didn't care for was the big, white lettering on the black dial."
2,bad sound,"The speakers have a nice design and are easy to handle. Practical, quick set up, nice travel case. However they sound tinny, if one turns the volume up the membrane starts to distort, the sound is thin and has no body. I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Review for Altec Lansing XT2,"I am not particularly happy with the product. The sound is really tinny and cracks up midway up the volume range. The audio performance should have been better with a speaker priced close to $80. The only benefit is that it runs on USB as well, but then the sound output drops to half. Overall, will not recommend to others."
2,Not What I Expected From Altec Lansing,"While Altec Lansing makes great speakers, I was a bit disappointed with these as they lacked ""power"" and volume. Now it could be the sound card of the laptop I hooked them up to itself but I know when I plug in my Bose noise canceling headphones, I get tons of volume and rich sound.I've held on to the speakers but to be honest, after using them once or twice, I've tucked them away in a closet and haven't used them yet."
2,Not too impressed,"I purchased these speakers to be used with PowerPoint video presentations to a limited number of attendees, so I was not looking for super-powerful speakers, which not surprisingly, these certainly are not.The setup was puzzling, as the new Lenovo Windows 7 did not recognize the USB audio output, necessitating 20 minutes of Control Panel>Sound setup (I am not quite sure how I got them to finally work -scary).The troubling issue is the cost! at $175, I was expecting higher-output, higher quality speakers. My old Dell desktop give-away speakers seem to be as good as these, you know, the ones that seem to stack up with all the old computers one seems to have over the years. But, I love the tiny carrying case, and ease of traveling with these, so i will keep them. Seems like they would be worth maybe $30 tops, certainly not $175."
3,Decent sound in a small package,"I did not realize these were intended for notebook computers and come with their own traveling case. I use them with a desktop and the sound is okay. They are powered through a USB connection, so I don't have to use the included power adapter -- that saves one wire and plug! I usually try to avoid Logitech because of several bad experiences with their software and drivers, but there is no software to load for these speakers."
5,Good Value,"I ordered these speakers for $26.95 plus shipping from the ""All"" store. The price was soooo much lower than all of the other stores, I figured I would get a reply saying that the price was mistake.I promptly received the product, as advertised and in good condition, and it appeared that fulfillment was done by Amazon as Amazon was listed on the return address.The speakers sound great by my self-admitted unsophisticated standards. I cannot explain the low price, but given that I received the merchandise, I cannot complain."
2,Nice laptop accessory,"Sometimes you'd like some music for a group where you don't have a formal music set-up. These laptop speakers do a nice job. On a vacation in Italy, all the laptop music, even from the internet, was ringing out. Good volume and tone.Update: Didn't last long. Died."
1,Not as loud as my laptop's built-n speakers.,"Definitely too expensive to be such a disappointing product. If you're looking for loud, keep looking. I wanted more volume from my Dell Vostro 1500 for watching movies. This was $50 down the drain."
3,I'm not as enthusiastic about this DVD as the other reviewers,"Maybe I'm bad at following directions, but I found this DVD a bit hard to follow even though I can see that the movements are simple. Some of this is due to viewing it on a small laptop screen while standing up: often the two practitioners are filmed from a fairly far distance.I know that Qigong is supposed to be very good and I'm sure I'll ""get it"" in time, but as the header says, I'm not that enthusiastic about this DVD.It's also too bad that the menu doesn't give one the options of going straight to a particular move or sequence. It's ""all or nothing""."
5,Qigong for Beginners,"I am a person that does not like exercise. Since Qigong is good for the immune system, and I heard it was good for asthma, I decided to give it a try. The deep breathing along with gentle stretching was not at all strenuous. I must say my breathing appeared to be better after the exercises. Along with these exercises were different head, face, and leg massages that would trigger accu-pressure points. I found the DVD very relaxing and informative."
5,Absolutely wonderful practice,The beginning practice on this DVD is easy to follow. The program is energizing and really a good stretch at the same time.I can only recommend this DVD!The second Disk is a documentary of Qigong in China. If one needs any proof that this program works the 90 year old Qigong master in the documentary has the agility of a 30 year old man. I have never seen a man of this age that has retained this amount of body coordination and flexibility. Really amazing!Thanks for making this wonderful material available to people outside China.
4,great DVD! completely satisfied!,"If you've had some exposure to Tai Chi or Qigong, this is a great DVD for exercising on your own. But I recommend this for a beginner with some caution -- be patient with the pacing and listen carefully to the underlying philosophy to get the most from this.Good production values and well thought out.Haven't yet watched the documentary on the 2nd DVD but this might be a good place to start for the true beginner."
3,A Teaching tool but not a guided qigong practice,"I possess a 15 minute guided qigong practice that I really like. This DVD offers an extra presentation of the authors time in China and is interesting but the DVD is an instructional teaching session whereby the author and his wife DEMONSTRATE THE MOVEMENTS- after doing some introductory warm up moves/poses/stretches the author gives the viewer 16 more movements which are to be practiced randomly to replicate the chaos in the human universe. I immediately went to the web, and ordered another one of Dr. Chen's Tai Chi GongFa Dvd's. His are a guided experience where you do the same routine with him for as long as you like. There are 5 levels and I went from 1 to level 3. I would not have purchased this first DVD had I realized, it was up to me to memorize 20 movements and to make up my own routine-a little too advanced for me at this time."
3,"Good, but confusing to follow","The documentary that accompanied this set was marvelous... To me, it alone was worth the price! What had me so discouraged was trying to follow the Qi Gong instructions. I had so much difficulty in trying to do the 'opposite' of what I was seeing the instructors doing: like following instructions: take your left, then your right, now with your left, facing them and 'seeing' the opposite. The exercises were perhaps simple enough and easily learned...but for me it was just too difficult to translate 'doing the opposite' of what I was seeing. I realize others may not have this problem, but I thought I should at least present this as possibly confusing a number of other people. I have a couple of other Tai Chi and Qi Gong tapes but they don't present the same challenge... you ""do"" what you are ""seeing.""...without having to constantly translate left and right."
4,Good introduction.,I like the man and the method he uses to teach QiGong. The location is peaceful and he does a good job.
2,If you're hard of hearing like me...,"DON'T buy this product if you expect it to be closed captioned as it says in the product description:Format: Closed-captioned, Color, DVD-Video, NTSChttp://www.amazon.com/Qigong-Beginning-Practice-Beginners/dp/B00049QPII/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1213912253&sr;=8-1Buyer beware! This product has NO closed captions and hearing impaired people will NOT be able to read what is being said in the background."
4,very relaxing,"I don't really buy the whole ""chi"" healing power but it is very good for concentration and relaxation. The tape is very long (an hour and one half) and seems to be pretty well made."
3,Long Winded,It takes forever to get through the moves and they are separated to much. I like there video for cleansing better.
3,Oigong Eight Brocade Begining Practice,"Not what I expected - this is not an Eight Brocade exercise, but is a different set of exercises. It is not bad, but not what I was looking for."
2,not for novices,Too much on one dvd for total beginers. Also thought I was purchasingLee holden picture on front looked like him. I tried but had a hard timefollowing . Have returned this one.
3,Ok but not their greatest work.,"I now have this cd, Diva Nation, and Hormonal Imbalance by the Four Bitchin' Babes. I'd rank them Hormonal Imbalance #1 with 5 stars, Diva Nation #2 with 4.5 stars, and this one 3rd with only 3 stars."
4,THIS IS JUST FANTASTIC MUSIC,"from the time when just ice partnered with krs one....this will satisfy you. it's classic, hardcore yet socially conscious. a good listen!"
5,A Timeless Musical Gem,"35 years ago, the Beatles released their landmark album 'Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band', and the world of popular music would never be the same. The album sounds as if it were a dream the was forged into Lennon and McCartney's minds, make an album, title it after an imaginery group, and try to be that group on the record(and let Ringo sing lead for the first time). With just a look at the album cover, it makes you think that this could be something more than an album, it could be a soundtrack for the generation ansd generations to come. The Beatles certainly raised the bar musically with their arrangements and experimentations on this album, but they also showed that change could be a godd thing, and when you are tired of being the same band on every single record, try being another band."
4,DeLuxe,"Nothing much to add about the album, all is being said already. I ordered this one, got it and asked myself: what is the meaning of ""[DELUXE EDITION]""? It was just a plain and simple cd: jewelcase, cd with standard tracks, booklet, nothing more."
5,The Beatles is best!,I have all the albums with The Beatles - and now I buy them remastered cos they are worth havingin the best possible soundcondition.........don't you think?This is their best album along with Abbey Road.
5,mono mix is very different,"Up until ABBEY ROAD, there were seperate mixes for all BEATLE tracks -- one in mono, and another in stereo. The Beatles normally would sit in on the mono mixes, and leave the stereo versions to George Martin and crew. There are many marked differences between the two versions of this classic album, most notibly during the finale of GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING, SGT. PEPPER REPRISE and A DAY IN THE LIFE. If you are a student of the stereo version, you will easily pick out all of the changes. A very interesting listen, and quite a rare piece of vinyl to boot."
4,great but don't believe the hype,"This album certainly has some great tracks: ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,"" ""Good Morning, Good Morning"" ""She's Leaving Home,"" ""A Day in the Life"" etc. However, once we get past all the mumbo jumbo about how important it is, it really doesn't compare to the two previous Beatles' albums Revolver and Rubber Soul.Did it make rock n' roll art for the first time? Of course not. Robert Johnson was art. Muddy Waters was art. Elvis was art. Bob Dylan was widely recognized as art (and was playing rock) a couple of years before this. And, of course, the Beatles were art on their previous albums. And, thanks to George Martin, little on this album really ""rocks"" anyway. Ultimately it's a really great orchestral pop album (and Frank Sinatra and others certainly made orchestral pop art a long time ago).Did it inaugurate the psychedelic era? In 1967? Are you kidding? By then the it was practically over on the West Coast.So, in other words, buy this CD for the music, not the hype."
3,Sgt. Pepper's still rocks!,"Although somewhat disappointed that a few of the original songs seem to be recorded differently than on the original album, the clarity of the music and lyrics are as clear and fun as ever. I keep it in my car permanently and listen to it whenever I need to ""let loose""!"
2,Still no definitive version on CD and probably never will be...,"The only thing I cared about when I picked up the new remastered version of Sgt. Pepper was getting to the reprise and finding out if someone finally had the sense to restore the missing elements of the reprise lost since the original mono LP release. They didn't.The reprise of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" is supposed to be the great rock and roll lead-in to our huge finale, and it is absolutely essential to have - in fact, the whole effect hinges upon - Paul McCartney yelling his head off at the end. With that missing, the song is ruined and it remains so.I haven't found out yet on these ""remasters"" if they've restored the missing harmonica on ""Thank You Girl"" or thrown out that horrid dry guitar on ""I Feel Fine"" and ""She's a Woman""....if not, we'll have to rely on those otherwise unnecessary Capitol version CD releases, but as for Sgt. Pepper...no salvation."
2,Sgt. Pepper,"As is noted at least weekly in these reviews, Sgt. Pepper is perenially overrated by Rolling Stone, VH1 and other polls. This is largely due to the nostalgia of the times by the polling audience as opposed to the music itself. The title track is actually good and the close of the album is good, but there are too few bright spots in between."
5,Not as good as Pet Sounds,"All though Seargent Peppers is a classic, as well as Revolver, the White Album, and Abbey Road, none can match the Beach Pet Sounds. The Beatles are the best group of all time, but in terms of the best ALBUM, none can match this . it's simply too beautiful; every song is fresh, and is from the Heart. How can you compare Within You Without You to God Only Knows, which even Paul McCartney admitted was the best pop song of all time?"
3,THE MOST OVERRATED ALBUM IN POP HISTORY,"Regardless to what you have heard this is not the best album ever made or even the best Beatles album(The White Album has to be the best).Paul Mcartney heard the Beach Boys""Pet Sounds"" and was influenced to make an album that musically broke all the barriers in pop music. Unfortunately for Mcartney, you can't get any better than ""Pet Sounds"". Sgt. Pepper has to be the most overrated album in pop history. Save your money and buy ""Pet Sounds"" instead."
4,Cut the last track,"""Day in the Life"" was the perfect ending to a great album. Why add a little ditty at the end with the remaster? Sure maybe vinyl was a little confining, but didn't it's limitations allow the artist to choose the best and discard the rest? There should be an option on a CD or DVD to have access to extra tracks, but not part of the original. Maybe a ""hit play again to hear added tracks"" option."
2,how oarful!!!!!!!!!,"When my mother plays this albun she is 'all over the place' . when mah fatha cums in da barthroom jibbering 'when ah get aulder loosening mah heir man, Years from now' I think hees attit again.There is nogood songs here at all and there4 this CD is bleeding oreful!!!!!!!Eric Sykes. age 4"
2,MUSIC REMIX ALTERED THE MUSIC,"REMIX CHANGED INSTUMENTS AND VOCALS PLACEMENT BY ALTERING, AT TIMES THE VOCALS AND INSTRUMENTS RELATIONSHIPS FROM FOREGROUND TO BACKGROUND. SOUNDS LIKE THOSE DOING THE REMASTERING THOUGHT, "" IF WE MAKE THESE CHANGES IT WILL SOUND EVEN BETTER"" THE SAMENESS WOULD BE BEST AS THE BEATLES HAD IT JUST RIGHT. IT SOUNDS DIFFERENT, DISAPPOINTED."
2,"The Cover is Great, the Music Drags","It is primarily nostalgia on the part of 40+ year olds that results in the high ratings for this album. The times were different and the cover of this album was a breakthough. Unfortunately, the music contained herein wasn't so inspiring, as it is dominated by ditties such as With A Little Help From My Friends, Fixing A Hole, and When I'm 64, and supposed innovation on Lucy in the Sky, Mr. Kite and A Day in the Life. Other bands were producing much better music, and this record really hasn't stood the test of time. Sounds dated. 2-stars."
1,Won't Play On A Computer,"I can't comment on the music quality because I can't get it to play on my computer. The file format is .exe, not .wav or .mp3 or .ogg or any standard audio format. I can't believe they used a proprietary .exe format that only works with Windows! I've tried four different music players but the only thing that will play is the little video. My computer can't see the audio files to rip them to my harddrive, either. The same holds true for the remastered Revolver CD. Very disappointed!EDIT: I found a keyboard hack that allowed me to access the audio tracks in .ogg format and rip them to my HDD. So it can be done, but nobody should have to spend hours researching the internet just to play a CD."
4,Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band CD,"Had forgotten that the Beatle's sounded so tinny compared to tadays sound, buyt overall I enjoy the CD. Thanks!!"
3,You had to be there,"If you grew up in the sixties and liked the Beatles at all, you'll want this. If you didn't, you probably won't ""get"" it. Not their greatest selection, but Lonely Hearts Club had its own sound at a time when the Fab Four were 'evolving.'"
5,"Best Beatles album, best ever abum","Many bands experiment, some fall and some become great. The Beatles were already great, and with Srgt Peppers they became greater, the greatest. This is the best album of all time. The Beatles' music belongs with Mozart, Beethoven and Radiohead. It is better than Tscikovski. It inspired bands such as Oasis, and they are awesome. Anyone who can inspire amazing bands are immortal as musicians.Srgt Peppers will stand the test of time, will live forever. If you have any patience listen to this album 100 times non-stop and it will be 'getting better all the time'."
3,Not among their best,"Have a feeling that my dislike of this recording relative to other Beatles recordings is the hype. Not a bad record, just bloated with lots of ordinary songs. Yet I was lead to believe it was their masterpiece. What a crock. The Who Sell Out, another ""concept"" record released that same year is far superior. On the plus side, Lovely Rita and A Day in the Life are wonderful, but 2 great songs on a Beatles record? Heck, Let it Be had more than that. Perhaps judged in the context of it's time it was great, but so were Abbey Road and Revolver and they still sound great. I won't go into ""Within Without You"" because I if I do I will have to dock it another star."
3,Wonderland Wallop,a gallop thru a wonderland with wallop. truly a landmark work making a story-like effect and great tunes to boot!
2,Excellent recording; FAIL on packaging,"This is a great CD - the sound is crisp and clean. If you have an older CD, then this is the one to get.EXCEPT.Whomever decided to save a few bucks by replacing a jewel case with a cardboard sleeve should be taken out back. The point of the case is to PROTECT THE CD. A cardboard sleeve not only doesn't protect it, but it actually damages it. Wherever there's a seam in the sleeve, the CD will get scratched. Wherever the seam is glued, glue will leak out onto the CD when the package sits in a hot delivery truck.This is what happened to me. The CD arrived scratched and covered in glue. Fortunately, the damage was on the data track, so I had a chance to listen to the music before I had to return it.I will avoid buying any CD/DVD/BluRay that comes in a non-jewel case like the plague. Sure, it is eco-hostile (plastic never goes away, it just floats in the great garbage patch forever), but there's no point in buying a plastic disk only to have to return it."
5,What ? You haven't got it ?,"I won't do a deep analysis of Sgt. Pepper here. But whatever some might say, in the next centuries people will still be talking about this album, and there must be a reason, don't you think, folks ? A good one (but not the only one!) is that it contains 20th century's greatest piece of ""popular"" music, ""A Day In The Life"". I do mean it. Nobody else had done something like this and nobody else ever will."
5,"Wonderfully creative, poetic, timeless, suberbly artistic","When this album came out unfortunately I was not a teenager nor a young adult. I wish I had been at that age, when it would have been best to appreciate this truly ground-breaking album. I was a child and couldn't take part in what must have been a frenzy of rushing to buy it, and a fascination of listening to it over and over. It was truly unique, and still is. It is incredibly creative and innovative and was way ""ahead"" of its time. I heard the Beach Boys just quit working on their album (not sure which) at the time Sgt. Pepper came out. They were so impressed with the quality of Sgt. Pepper that they had no heart to make what they knew would be a lesser album. I only hope that some day I might write something as creative as what the Beatles wrote. The music of the Beatles will live forever!"
1,TERRIBLE,how nerdy is this band. here you will get some of the worst songs ever created. sgt pepper lonely hearts club band is a terrible song as is the rest of the album. only recomended if you have bad taste in music ie rap linkin park or backstreet boys type garbage. not even worth the 1 star amazon forces me to give it. singed joe fleck.
1,Bunch of rip off artists,This album is a rip off Pink Floyd's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. The beatles copied Pink Floyd and this is the reason why Pink Floyd are better. Simply a weak and disgusting effort. Best avoided.
2,dated and over-rated,"Compared to most other Beatles albums, this album now sounds dated and does not show the Beatles at their best or most creative. I have to say it is one of my least favourite Beatles albums, and I would urge anyone not to make this their first purchase, try Rubber Soul or A Hard Day's Night instead.Lucy In The Sky is a decent enough pop song, Fixing a Hole is quite good, but there's little else here of note. It's a bit of a sloppy album, and the Pepper concept is a little pathetic.I'll get shot down in flames for stating these opinions I'm sure, but I stand by them, it's a heavily over-rated album. Ask a room full of Beatles fans what their favourite Beatles album is, and very few would say Pepper."
1,car crash victims don't sing and play the bass,"Hi, my name's Scott, I'm 12 next spring I have been studying all Beatle litterature and theirown sleazy CDs and I have come to find without a single shotgun doubt that PMC was really killed beyond reecognition after the infamous carcrash that took his life on wednesdaymnornnng at 9 o clock.Listen, grandiose naysayers and other friends, you just can't go on pretending he's still the same today as he was burns of the Past Age' - the man is really no more, he is exit, finito, passed on to the merry pastures, he's friggin dead.See why Heather Mills was so upset when she found out she married an imposter.Cheers Bob, here's to ya!Scott"
2,Sgt Pepper revisited.,I bought this remembering what I thought about the Beetles and boy was it a disappointment. My gosh they weren't very good were they; rather amateurish and just not very good musically.The songs were good and I did enjoy revisiting the album which I hadn't heard in over 20 years. But the one thought I came away with was that they weren't really very good and one wonders how they came to be what they became.
2,Sgt. Pepper,"""...they use so many instruments that no other artist of their era could think of?..."" No one had ever played of a sitar? They were the first to use a symphonic orchestra? The statements made up by people regarding this album are incredible. There are three good songs on this release. At the going download rate of 99 cents per song, I might buy this if it were marked down to $2.97."
1,DRM Rip-off!!!!!,"The CD is totally worthless to me since it won't play in my computer's CD-Rom. It has the Compact Disk logo, but doesn't conform to the required standards for that logo - totally unethical! I use my computer as my stereo, and never would have purchased this CD if I'd known that the publisher doesn't comply with compact disk standards."
2,Should Have Been A Single 45 rpm Record,"This should have been released as a single with side A - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Side B - A Day in the Life.The rest of this offering is just mediocre - Within You Without You, Mr. Kite, Fixing A Hole, etc. Anyone who says that they are just discovering the Beatles and are impressed by this is exaggerating. It's just not that great."
3,3 top tunes...,"I give this Beatles classic 3 STARS because I love 3 tracks on the album. The first track ""SGT PEPPER"" rocks. ""Getting Better"" has a helluva sound to it. ""And A Day In The Life"", IS THE MOST INSANE THING I ever heard."
4,"Clarity & Sound A+, Song labeling F",The album is fantastic for sound quality and clarity. However I was very disappointed to see not one of the song titles displayed on my JBL stereo in my `07 Camry Hybrid after the sticker on the outside of the album bragged about how they had taken extra steps for Ipod song labeling. Granted it is not an Ipod player however other albums show the song names just fine.
2,"C'mon, Beatles! WHAT WENT WRONG??","The songs on here are really funky. they have the weirdest songs that nobody really likes. i think that they had potential for this cd but they wanted to do something different. they sure did and it turned out to be bad! sorry, just an opinion!2 best songs: Day in the Life & With a Little Help....2 WOrst songs: within you without you & benefit MR KITE"
1,Ordered New CD...received USED CD,"I ordered a brand new copy of the Sgt. Pepper's cd. I paid the brand new price. I received a used CD. It had no plastic covering, and was labelled ""USED"".I don't think this is right. And there seems to be nowhere to complain except here."
3,Adequate,"Although O.K., it's nowhere near the top of the list of the best albums of all time. While there are some good songs, fans new to the Beatles (i.e. those NOT being influenced and swept away by nostalgia for their youth) consistently find that too much of this album is weak (Little Help From My Friends, Fixing a Hole, Mr. Kite, Within You).Admitedly, this album offered some breakthroughs (printed lyrics, artwork, etc.) and therefore was influential, but it doesn't even rank up there with Abbey Road; much less Dark Side of the Moon, Are You Experienced, or Pet Sounds. 3-stars."
3,the emperor has no clothes,"if this were from any other band, it would be one of the Top 100. As a Beatles album, it sucks. I know that I""m blaspheming, but you heard it here."
2,CLEARLY OVERRATED,"Why so many people keep saying this album is so great ?? It's nothing more than the great Beatles playing around with studio techniques and, consequently, losing all their spontaneous creativity. The sound is very bad, RIngo Starr's drums are worse instead of better !!! Most of the songs try so hard to be great that they are boring most of the times ...I prefer even the album ""HELP"" or "" ABBEY ROAD"". I admit that the album opened up possibilities for rock."
5,An Absolute Must,"At the time of the initial release of Sgt. Pepper, there werw NO SINGLES released from this album, yet almost everybody knows every song. What else needs to be said?....."
5,"The Beatles I know, But whos Fred Durst?????","This is a great album by the beatles, great music and as always great song writing.If you haven't already brought this record I would recommend it no matter what music your into.The only negative review on this album is by the guy below whos into Fred Durst and that says it all."
5,My first Beatles album! BILLY SHEARS!,"Ahh, the memories. Buying this cd for 29.99 at HMV when I could have gotten it at Future Shop for 18.99! Oh well, it was worth it! Best song on Sgt. Pepper is, hands down, ""A Day In The Life"". That alone was worth the 29.99 (plus tax...34 something) This is the kind of album where you listen to the whole thing once and you already love it! Well for me anyway. (Revolver took me a few listens for me to eventually love). This album is a must have for any Beatle fan, and the casual music lover. This review is ""getting very near the end."" So ""sorry but it's time to go!"" Long Live Pepper!"
1,Non-Functional CD,The product (CD) would not function in any of my three CD players. It malfunctioned in the same manner on all three players. I can only assume that poor quality control on the part of whatever organization produced and or shipped this product allowed this faulty product to be shipped. I returned it.
4,great but flawed,"Better than Revolver but inferior to Abbey Road and most of the White Album. Like the White Album, it also contains filler- Within You Without You has it's place on the album, but when listened to on it's own, it sucks. Same for She's Leaving Home, Getting Better, and When I'm Sixty Four."
5,The Greatest Album Ever...No Question,"I'm 18 and the biggest Beatles fan ever. All that needs to be said is that Sgt Pepper released on June 2, 1967 changed music. People my age refuse to believe that if the Beatles had not come to America and played on the Ed Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964, music would . When the Stones followed and released Satisfaction, the English Invasion started. Thats why we have Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, etc. Back to Sgt Pepper, this album is sheer genius. John Lennon's A Day In The Life is one of the greatest songs ever. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds was also a different sound. Mr. Kite was taken from a circuis poster. I want to know who, other than them, would do that? Anything anyone has done in music was first done by the Beatles. The only concept album that even compares is Pink Floyd's complete masterpiece ""The Wall"". Sgt Pepper is the greatest and anyone that thinks otherwise just doesn't understand."
1,a bit twee for my tastes,"There are some ok tracks on it like A Day in My Life but most of it is pretty poor, somewhat dated and a bit ""music hall"". Not really suited to modern tastes. I'd go ahead and buy it if you really like that 60's music hall feel. Personally I like more heavy guitar type music like you find on ""Revolver"""
1,This album doesnt deserve the hype,"I use to be a big beatles fan but even then i hated this album. Its kind of weird that i dislike Sergeant Pepper so much because I really liked the Stones Their Satanic Majesties Request and Pink Floyds Piper at the Gates of Dawn. To me those albums had more beauty and imagination. Sergeant Pepper is just very dull and cutsy.The songs are all trite and petty,the album has no mood and little atmosphere. The songs are so childlike that I cant imagine kids enjoying them.The main problem that I have with this album is that its just not interesting.Even the cover is dumb. It has no beauty or darkness, it is pure silly drivel. Even A Day in the Life is dull and well, lifeless. I appreciate the fact that this album broke barriers and helped turn rock music into an art form but that doesnt mean i have to like it."
1,Terrible Album,I don't see what is so great about this album it () big time a guy from my work told me to buy it he said it's amazing.I wasted my money one this junk piece.I would recomend buying The Velvet Underground/Nico now thats an amazing Album and a Great Band.I read in a magazine that Lou Reed hated this Beatles Album.I agree with him 100%.People out there dont buy this LP its a waste of money.And probably the worst album from 1967
1,"Quaint, but over-rated.","This is the album self-deluded Beetles fans love to point to as their work of genious. Lemon and McCarthy were alledgedly at the top of their form.Oh, come now!It's a quaint period piece; a relic of the sixties. The music sounds dated. It's nostalgia, but nostalgia ain't art!You'd do better to get ""Pet Sounds"", written, arranged, and produced by a REAL genious: Brian Wilson. It sounds as fresh and sophisticated today as when it was first released.Future generations will revere Brian Wilson's music the way Beethoven's is revered now. The Beetles will be a mere footnote in history if they get mentioned at all.Save your money, and pick up ""Pet Sounds"" instead; you'll be glad you did.- Mean Mr. Mustard"
1,Rock's worst mistake,"The idea of this being the greatest album of all time! It's a joke! Before heaving yourself onto the ""Sgt. Pepper's"" bandwagon, consider investigating some other, substantial music. If it's art you're searching for, consider Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue,"" a brilliant, more popular album that is light-years ahead of this corny, pompous horse dung. If you're in search of ""rock as art,"" consider Led Zeppelin, a band whose best albums make this seem like the stuff of a middle school talent show. So please, before polluting my monitor with phrases like ""the best album ever"" and ""the finest rock in history,"" find out what's out there. You just might be blown away."
1,The most overated album in rock and roll history!,"I just don't get why anybody likes this album! It makes everybody's best of all time list and it is unlistenable. Does anybody that rates this or judges this actually listen to it or is it just considered great because of what it ""supposedly"" revolutionized. There's only one song worth listening to more than once (We all know that's A Day In The Life). C'mon, Lovely Rita, I'm Fixin' A Hole, Lucy, Friends. This ain't Rock and Roll and I don't like it! Give me Pet Sounds any day! Give me The Village Green Preservation Society and I can listen to it for days on end. If I had to listen to Sgt. Pepper I'd probably have to be sedated. God Save The Kinks!"
1,Concern that this CD was not the original product,"I had purchased this CD so as my wife turned 64 we could listen to the classic words of ""Will you still love me when I'm 64?"" Neither of the CD's delivered actually included the song with the original words. There were no words with the music. I was credited the purchase price back, but am puzzled why the version you stock is not the 'classic' original? Thank you if you can give any clarification. Walter Sleeth"
5,Forget When I'm 64,"People focus far too much on When I'm 64, by far the weakest track. Obviously, A Day In The Life, Sgt. Pepper, Friends, and Lucy are great. Two of the their most underrated songs, however, are Getting Better (mutilated on TV) and She's Leaving Home. Kite, Rita, and Good Morning are really good for throwaway tracks."
1,skimming the brim,"Call in critics, legends and biased fans. This record has been OVERBLOWN TREMENDOUSLY for ages and ages.It is entirely passe and lacklustre with mediocre themes and lack of continuity. I have always felt this record had been better left in the can. Fxing a hole is the only decent song if it weren't tempted at boring wallpaper music.This is a BAD RECORD, best avoided.Thanks for the review."
1,"Sgt. Pepper, Beatles Album","Maybe i'm just too old but I bought this album due to all the praises it has received expecting to hear classic Beatles. I was very disappointed with it and gave it to my daughter for my grandkids. They didn't like it either & it now sits on a shelf. I really like the ""old"" Beatles & also have their # 1 Album which is OK. As I said, maybe i'm just too old and the fact that my favorite music is Chicago type blues by Muddy Waters. John Lee Hooker, etc. might color my music enjoyment."
1,The Beatles WORST album,"This album is worthless. If you're Born after 1970 then Dont by this album, This album is for OLD people. Please there are alot of bands better than these 4 dirty looking british scallys. I could Not find one decent song on the whole thing,I love old school music but this is horrible. Songs like ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" and ""Good Morning, Good Morning"" are Horrible and Unoriginal. ""When I am 64"" and ""Within You, Without You"" Are laughable. Music is suppoed to be Entertainment, This album is boring and Worthless, When I listen to music, I wanna Be entertined, I dont Wanna listen to this worthless execuse for an album again, and by the way I checked this album out after hearing how Good and INFLUENTIAL it is, Sorry to break the chain for you beatles fans, this album is the worst album I ever heard. For all those looking for good old school music, Buy something from Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and The Rolling Stones."
1,SGT. PEPPER LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND,"DISAPOINTING. SANDY FARINA'S SONG WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE CD. IF I KNEW THIS, I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHESE THE CD."
3,An okay CD,"I'm wasn't born when the Beatles were writing their songs, but I like some of their songs. It's nice to see a Cd where not all the songs are love songs - I have nothing against love songs, but they get boring if there's nothing else on the radio. Anyway, the Cd's good, but not phenomenal. Abbey Road is better, if you're looking for a Beatles Cd. But this is the next best Beatles Cd after Abbey Road, so if someone likes the Beatles (and they already have Abbey Road), this Cd is a winner. Otherwise, stick with Abbey Road. There aren't that many Beatles songs that are significantly better than each other, but some Beatles Cd's are better than others."
2,Sgt. Pepper,"This is a remastered version and it seems that not all the original songs are on this, also Paul's voice overpowers everything else, someone should tone him down unless it was his idea hmmm....... I will not buy any remastered versions again."
5,Dollars and (common) cents.,"I'm going to rate this CD based on a $1 per song cost to total cost for the entire CD (Apple and Rhapsody charge $1 per song).I love the Beatles. I own every record. But based solely on $1 per song value (Amazon is currently charging $10 for the entire CD), it's worth $8. Why? The songs: Sgt Pepper, With a Little Help, Lucy in the Sky, She's Leaving Home, Sixty-Four, Lovely Rita, Sgt Pepper (reprise), and A Day in the Life. These are the songs I'm sure you've heard on the radio and they are great. Is it worth it to pay the extra $2 to get the entire CD? Sure, because it's the most influental album of all time (according to the 'experts') and because no Beatles songs are available on Apple or Rhapsody at this time. As well, the intent of the Beatles on the Sgt. Pepper album was for the listener to hear the music, from beginning to end, in one sitting.Hope this helps.DariumJune 2007"
2,"Sgt. Pepper, Track by Track","The opener Sgt. Pepper, is a good song, as the Beatles have decided to copy Jimi Hendix' distortion and style, but it's followed by Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, which is NO psychedelic adventure.We next enter a lull, as Getting Better and Fixing a Hole are weak, as other reviewers (who nevertheless give the album five stars) have noted, but we get a little lift with She's Leaving Home.The album then falls off a cliff with Mr. Kite, Within You Without You, When I'm 64, Lovely Rita and Good Morning. As other reviewers have noted (but still give the CD 5 stars because it's the Beatles), these are weak tracks.The CD recovers strong with Sgt. Pepper reprise (but its the same basic song) and A Day in the Life.Altogether, not nearly a great CD, but Sgt. Pepper and A day in the Life deserve a star. Oh well."
3,Disappointed,"Received in good condition and quite promptly with no glitches on the disc.I found the sound of the remastered CD to be surprisingly poor in light of the bright '#1s' and 'Yellow Submarine Songtrack' mixes of recent years. Though more bassey and the vocals more to th fore, the sound otherwise was almost muddy and required significant equalization on my part.My 'Nero' ripped and sound-enhanced copy proved more crystelline and definitive.The video add-on was stylishly produced though too short and insubstantial to be worth further discussion.The CD outlay itself however is well designed and quite informative."
3,6 MONTHS,"apparently they were recording this album for 6 months...so you would have expected something truly amazing.but in my opinion it is no where near the best beatles album.abbey road is so much better.the 30 seconds in the middle of ""a day in the life""(p macartney sings) is worth the money on its own."
5,The Alpha and Omega in popular music,"I don't even know why I need to rate this. This is without any doubt the greatest and most significant piece of recorded music in the 20th century. If you don't have it, you should buy it."
5,What can be said?,"This belongs in everyone's top five recordings of all time.Music as we know it would not exist without Sgt. Peppers.The recording techniques, the clarity, the variety of this recording inspired many who probably have nothing else in common and many of whom wouldn't even call themselves Beatles fans.It brought many other types of music into what was starting to become a predictable format. It changed everything!"
4,"undeniably influential, but...","This album certainly expanded the boundaries of what pop music could be, but in doing so strays a little far from the roots of rock for my tastes. I find the almost complete absence of George Martin's name from other reviews to be vexing. Lennon, McCartney and Harrison all do their part, to be sure, but I don't think George Martin gets enough credit (not just for this album but for The Beatles, period). In short, it's a must-have, but on the whole, give me Revolver."
5,Come on...,"... can anyone trule give this CD anything less than 5 stars? It's pure Beatles, pure genius, pure perfection."
4,Really a four-and-a-half!,"Some have called this the greatest rock album of all time. I am not sure about that. The album is definitely the greatest in terms of freedom of expression, since all four guys took an active role in creating this masterpiece. Apart from the music, one must appreciate the artful colors of the cover. ""Sgt. Peppers's.....Band and A Little Help From My Friends"" are two awesome songs rolled into one. ""When I'm 64"" is a great tune, as is my personal fave ""A Day in the Life"". Of course, who can leave out ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"", a song so great that Elton John tried to tackle it, as did William Shatner? In all, this was the Beatles' most creative effort, and offers a variety of themes, tunes, colors, and whatever else you might think of."
5,"The Beatles find their sound, one of the greatest albums","One of the greatest albums I ever heard. Unbelievable songwriting. Instead of ripping off American R&B and Rock artists they truly have their own sound with this album. Even though this wasn't the first concept album, this is the blueprint for all concept albums to follow."
3,"Good,but not Great","With the hyperbole surrounding this album,one would think the discovery of the silver chalice of music had been made.To the contrary, this is several rungs down the list of the Fab Four releases.Which is not to say this isnt a great album.To be sure,the creative juices were running high(along with the Beatles themselves),But a careful listening to thier previous 2 releases(Rubber Soul, Revolver)would show that much of the ground herehad already been broken.Unlike those 2 albums,however,this one was elaboratly produced,taking over 600 (!) hours to completethese 13 recordings.As a result,the effect is much more calculated than one would surmise from reading the rhapsodicreviews found here and other places.As it is ,Sgt. Pepper is a delightful pop listen,worthy of attention but not awe or reflexive genuflection."
4,Doesn't quite live up to the hype...,"Don't get me wrong this is a fine album. ""Sgt Pepper"", ""A Little Help From My Friends"", ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" and ""A Day in the Life"" are great songs. Still Sgt Pepper isn't perfect- I don't care for ""She's Leaving Home"" and ""Being For the Benefit of Mr Kite"" is just weirdness for weirness's sake, as opposed to John Lennons usually sublime musical weirdness. And I never really bought this as a concept album- the Beatles actually did a better job creating an album that transcends its individual songs with the B side of Abbey Road (which is my pick for the best rock record ever.) Still this is a classic with some really great music, and no CD collection would be complete without it."
5,How could they record this in months...,I have been listening and exploring this album for two decades and it is still fresh and triumphant. This album is one of the finest accomplishments in man's history. I can not wait to share this with my infant son one day.
5,THIS THING ROCKS,"This album is my favorite Beatles album by far, and should be yours too. It has great songs, and is a very influential album. I recommend this to anybody looking at the Beatles for the first time, and also current Beatles fans that have not yet experienced this album."
3,"Sgt Peppers not as good as Magical Mystery Tour, Yellow Submarine, or Revolver","""It was novel at the time, but now sounds pretentious.""""Sgt. Peppers was a ""concept"" or ""story"" album, which was a fad that year 1967...the beach boys did one too ""pet sounds"" they both suck, but people say they're their best albums of all time.""Beatles Expert :)I totally agree with those two quotes, it is very overrated and one of the most known albums and the one that everybody talks about, but albums such as Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine, and its predecessor, revolver are much better. Now if strawberry fields and penny lane which were supposed to be on Sgt. Peppers it would have made it a bit better but it still wouldnt have compared with the Beatles other albums. With A Little Help From My Friends and Good Morning Good Morning are two very good songs, the rest of the albums tracks are songs I'll occassionally listen to, but they really aren't that good of songs."
5,The Four Horsemen Triumph Again,"The argument over which Beatles album is best will never end with this album vying with Revolver etc for the title.Personally I think it's Abbey Road but Sgt Pepper is very close,and if in the right mood maybe my favorite.These things change ya know!Now the songs,not a weak one among them as the Beatles perfect psychedelic music and make rock music a bonafide art form.As the reviewer states no one took rock seriously until Sgt Pepper though an argument could be made that Revolver also did. The album itself is a melange,yes a melange! of quirky english psychedelia,rock and old style english pop that some would say is the blueprint for brit-pop along with Revolver. Musical escapism at it's best and a testament to the unsurpassed musical genius of the Beatles.Buy!!!"
2,UNFUFFILED EXPECTATION,"Bought this album with the greatest expectations. What a lack of expectations ... Of course it is good. AFter all, the Beatles are playing it !!. But, playing what ?? The album is so confusing, so much overdubs, tre drums production is awful. It's no the beste Beatles album. So what for printed lyrics ?? THios does not necesarily turn all the songs in it into master pieces of pop !!"
2,OK,"It's not that this album is so bad, it's just not as influential as uninformed listeners and meaningless polls hold it out to be. An album with Within You Without You is tough rate 5 stars."
3,Decent,"This album is completey overrated. All of McCartneys songs are way too poppy and cheesy. The album is Okay, but it is not a real masterpiece. If you want a true piece of art listen to any album by Pink Floyd starting from Meddle to The Wall. If you want some real rock and roll get a Stones album like Let It bleed or Exile On Main Street. This CD is WAy overrated."
3,Really Nothing Special,"Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad album. It's even just about good. But great? No, I'm sorry. The Beatles were not great. Lennon and McCartney were not great writers. They didn't have a great turn of phrase, or any unique insight. The Beatles were not great innovators, they were just good at spotting where things were going early, and stealing the idea for themselves (scousers stealing? Surely not). If you want the album that everyone bought, and the band that everyones sister fancied (ooh, sounds suspiciously like Boyzone!) then buy this. But if you want dynamic radical, ground breaking beautiful music, look elsewhere. The emperor's not wearing any clothes Mummy! The Beatles were NOT great.(I know you're all going to hate me for saying this, but someone had to. Just try to keep down the expletives if you email, I've got a wife and kid!)"
2,Sgt. Pepper,"The oom-pah band behind behind When I'm 64, the fumbling sitar on Within You Without You, and the orchestra behind She's Leaving Home don't exactly make for great rock music. Perenially overrated, this will always be a controversial album. Overall, many releases from the late 60s have held up much, much, better."
3,Most overrated album of all time,"This is a classic case of misplaced admiration, which starts a bandwagon into motion which so many seem compelled to jump upon. Who knows what got it started. It doesn't really matter. Now for the truth.Sgt Pepper, Lucy in the Sky, A Day in the Life, are good songs. Not great songs. Just good. The rest of it is boring, forgettable mediocrity. Shouldn't the ""greatest album of all time"" offer at least a wee bit more? This is not a knock against the Beatles. McCartney and Lennon truly deserve the accolades they're received as songwriters. I suspect those two got a laugh over the years at all the praise for what they probably secretly consider only an average work.You want a truly ""great"" album, from the same era? Try ""Aqualung"" by Jethro Tull, or other Beatle albums, at least four of which are better than Sgt Pepper."
2,The Undisputed Champion of Overrated Albums,"I fell for the hype myself a long time ago, but it didn't last long. Apart from A Day In The Life and A Little Help From My Friends, who really listens to this anymore? It's pretty damn fluffy and incredibly pretentious at the same time. A triumph of production to be sure, but stuff like Lovely Rita or Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite haven't aged at all well and led to further silliness like Magical Mystery Tour. The most thoughtful track is George Harrison's Within You And Without You, but even that is a tough slog to sit through. Antiquated and often cutesy arrangements are also a problem, and maybe a product of too much acid on everyone's part. If you want prime Beatles, go to Past Masters, Abbey Road, parts of The White Album, and a couple of tracks of Let It Be. This is really overblown and not worth it at all."
3,(not)The best album in rock history?,"When i first heard this album i thought i was going to find a musical icon, a masterpiece of rock pshycadelia as every rock music critic and Beatles' fan say. The result of my listening, except for a few tracks, like 'Fixing a hole' and 'Sgt Peppers Reprise', wich woke me up, is that i felt asleep for the complete record's duration.The problem is , beside that it sounds like the tipical british pop sound of that time, is that there is nothing you could take out from the set that would stand out, for example, 30 years from now, or even today.This record is not 1/2 as good as Hendrix's 'Are you Experience?'or Pink Floyd's 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn', music gems of that year, there was a lot happening elsewhere, and the Beatles sound had lost the freshness of the first records (specially 'Revolver', which i love). I'm sorry but this record is the tree that blinds you from seeing the forest."
2,Sgt. Pepper,"""If it weren't for Sgt. Pepper, progressive rock would never have existed""?. I doubt it.This is an OK album with a few good tracks like A Day in the Life that can be had on the various greatest hits compilations without having to deal with songs like Within You Without You. 2-stars."
2,Tremedously Entertaining!,"No, not the album - which is fair, but the herd of biased and unthinking reviewers that will give any Beatle album 5-stars, despite the fact they contain songs like Within You Without You, or Mr. Kite. Simply hilarious!As for Sgt. Pepper, A Day in the Like is a classic, but it alone isn't worth 5-stars.2-stars."
3,"Style Over Substance , and So Overrated !","I'm afraid this has to be the most overrated album of them all . Ironically it is the cutting edge technology of the time that the Beatles were using that makes this album sound so dated today .The majority of these tracks are lightweight , with a hint of the cartoonish about them , but I'm afraid too many gullible people have swallowed the hype that the entertainment business has dished out to the public , to perpetuate the golden goose that is the Beatles . Talk about the tail wagging the dog !"
3,OVERRATED,"A day in the life is amazing.With a little help from my friends is very good,but the rest is yust ok.Rubber Soul,Revolver,Magical Mystery Tour,The White Album,Abbey Road and Let it be are all much better.Sgt.Pepper`s Lonely Hearts Club Band must be the most overrated album of all time."
2,The Most Overrated Album in Music History,"Almost the entire album is mediocre and not worth a purchase. The lyrics and melodies are infantile and grating, not to mention repetitive. When I hear songs like Lovely Rita, or Good Morning, Good Morning, I cant help but think they are best suited for kindergardeners. The one exception to the album is ""A Day in the Life"", one of my favorite songs of all time. This song is brilliant beyond description or compare, and redeems this album, making it a necessary purchase, unless you're willling to tape that one song. Why this unbelievable mediocrity is so praised is beyond me. When you hear it I'm sure you will agree."
1,Sgt. Peppers Lonely Heart Club Band missing!,"In my opinion, this was the worst mastering I have ever heard of a classic album. Especially a Beatles album. Vocals and instruments faded in and out or are missing altogether. Doesn't anyone listen to these before they are sold to the public? The poor mixing and production were no where close to the vinyl original in what I consider a blasphemy. I know this album by heart and as a long time musician I am sorely dissapointed."
2,Sgt. Pepper,"Far, far, far from the best album ever made. People say it captures the feel of 1967 psychedelia, but not as well as Hendrix's ""Are You Experienced"" or Cream's ""Disraeli Gears"". People say it is the world's greatest concept album, but it's not even in the same league as Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"".The fact is that there are some good songs here (A Day in the Life, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) and some poor songs as well (Within You Without You, When I'm 64, With A Little Help From My Friends, Fixing A Hole). Average them all out and you get a slightly below average album. 2-stars"
5,1967...where were you!,"Right on Mr. Ford. This album, even if you hate it is worth the respect of serious music lovers, yes even classical music lovers. I do not own a Bob Dylan album, but I respect his talent and his influence on pop music and society. Think he influenced the Beatles at all?!?!? Sgt. Pepper is not my favorite Beatle album, but it is a classic and a must have for any one considering listening to the Beatles catalog. Because it is so far removed from MTV, it seems trite or maybe out-dated, but believe me, in 1967 it was a master piece of gigantic proportions, and is still five star listening material. It changed the way everyone made or listened to music. Yes, there is a reason why the Beatles are still popular, but do not hate them for it. Listen to their genius. Sgt. Pepper is good listening because it is well produced, well written and performed, and yes...it takes you back a little if you are old enough to have been there in 1967!"
5,Most Influential Rock Record Ever Hands Down,"Bluesisbest you are so right man,that Ford guy is way off base. To use popularity as a basis for negating a work of art is the logic of the ignorant. Sgt Pepper is easily one of the finest rock albums ever,light years ahead of anything the Stones,Hendrix,Who et al ever did. Simply put Sgt Pepper influenced directly or indirectly EVERY rock/pop record released post-1967. Many who dismiss the Beatles do so because they eclipse their own favorites. Sgt Pepper is an exercise in artistic supremacy,I once read that the Hollies producer on seeing the recording of 'Day In The Life',almost cracked up ala Brian Wilson. They have NO competition."
2,Had More Potential,"If Fixing A Hole, She's Leaving Home and Within You Without You had been replaced by the best songs on Magical Mystery Tour (Hello Goodbye, Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields, All You Need is Love), which was released only months later, this would have been a 4 star album. There are a few good songs here though. The best is Sgt. Pepper."
1,Pretentious tripe,"I am a big fan of progressive rock. What I don't understand is how people can rip Yes, King Crimson, etc to pieces and how they can be barred from entering the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Yet, this pile of pop-garbage is hailed as the greatest thing since sliced bread. This album stands as a monument to the self-righteous, bloated image of the horrible baby-boomer demographic. How can people say this is visionary music, and in the same breath deride a true genius like Robert Fripp? Face it, the Beatles are nothing more nor less than the 1960's N'Sync. And why are all Beatles cd priced so high? Because they know they can fool the conumer into buying this tripe. This disc makes a good coaster and nothing more. Don't waste your money. Thank you for reading this."
5,vjb,any review of this that is not 5 stars is not even worth reading.this is and always will be one of the greatest of all time.what else is there to say?
4,The Greatest Album Ever? Surely Not...,"Could this possibly be the most over-rated album in history? I personally think there is a possibility of it. Sgt. Pepper is a great album, and one that everyone should own. But it does have the odd moment where it goes down hill - and, strangely enough, it's always Macca's fault. The album opens with the playful 'With A Little Help From My Friends', in which Ringo excels himself. But 'She's Leaving Home' and the truly abysmal 'When I'm 64'? What was McCartney thinking?! These two tracks should have been left off the album to make room for 'Strawberry Fields' and 'Penny Lane', the greatest of both Lennon and McCartney's songs. In a way, listening to this album brings a strange sense of foreboding - because they went from such a great album to the truly hideous 'Magical Mystery Tour'. Nuff said."
4,Good... but certainly not the best,"This album seriously is awesome. It has some of my favorite beatle's songs on it such as lucy in the sky and a day in the life, but still I would not crown it the best beatle's album ever. I would recommend that you buy abbey road if you don't already own it yet. That cd simply rocks."
4,It's not THE ROLLING STONES but it is the best,PEPPER is an ingenius album for sure there's no doubt about it. But it doesn't compare with any of the stones albums. This album is great though.
5,Sgt. Pepper's,"ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! Just gotta add my name to the list! This is the album that changed rock' n' roll a second time, both by the Beatles. It's incredible what this band did, including the producer George Martin, using a four-track recorder. This album was a representation of what this band could do in a studio. ""Revolver"" was the transitional album of a touring band into a studio-only band. ""Sgt. Pepper's"" is where the fruition of that effort materialized. My favorites are: ""Sgt. Pepper's"", ""Getting Better"", ""A Day in the Life"" & ""When I'm Sixty-Four"". Song-wise, this is not their strongest album (there's more than one weak moment) but there is something magical here. This is the album that Paul really began to flex his muscles within the band; creatively, he was strong, but he also really began to exercise himself as the arranger & musical director of the group. This fact, & the death of Brian Epstein, are two of the reasons why the breakup bells began to sound. Long Live Beatlemania!"
2,Pressing Problems,"I give this two stars for the quality of the audio and vinyl pressing, not because of the songs on the album itself. I ordered six of the new vinyl remasters and Sgt. Pepper was one of them. All of the others sounded absolutely amazing, but this one sounded atrocious. The bass won't come through without serious static, the highs sound like they're scratching on the way out of the speakers, and it just sounds horrible. Now, I don't think that all of the new Sgt. Pepper albums will sound this bad, this was just a problem with my particular copy. Buyers should beware that there have been some fairly widespread issues with the quality of these new vinyl pressings. Open and play them as soon as you get them so you don't way too long to get an exchange or refund if you happened to get a bad copy."
4,A Day in The Life.,"This album took pop music in a new direction and is one of my favorites.""A Day In The Life"", makes the album. And ""Its Getting Better"" is almost a perfect pop song. Some songs don't stand up as well as others like ""For The Benefit Of Mr Kite"". And overall it isn't as strong as the Beatles greatest album Ever ""Revovler"". But its definately worth adding to your collection."
5,One of the greatest achievements in modern music!,"The Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was quite possibly one of the greatest album's ever. The production by George Martin was revolutionary and his production techniques still sound fresh to this day. The songs have seamless transitions into each other and every track is memorable. My favorite's on the album are With a Little Help From My Friends, with it's playful lyrics and laid back beat, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds with its trippy lyrics and psychadelic melody, Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite with its carnival like sound, a great vocal from John Lennon and marching bass of Paul McCartney, When I'm Sixty Four with it's sped up vocals and lyrics about old age, and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise) with its screaming guitar breaks. This album is one of the most memorable of all time and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good album young or old."
2,"Absolutely, Magical Mystery Tour is far superior","Test yourself; sing as much of this album as you can, and then Magical Mystery Tour. The latter is much stronger, with several more memorable tunes, and sounds fresher today. A good bit of Sgt. Pepper's is too cutesy and novelty doesn't wear well. Ground breaking at the time? Sure. But that was then and this is now."
4,an engaging beatles album,"I don't think any Beatles album lives up to the hype but still, you can not help but love Sgt. Pepper's. The Beatles' songs-writing was able to creating a picture with words and sound (Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, A Day in the Life) as well as produce simple, concise pop songs that were both catchy and poignant (With a Little From My Friends, Getting Better). More than thirty years after release the album's tails of sexy meter maids and leaving a mundane home-life have offered some serious escapism for all of us lonely hearts."
3,"Least Fave Beatles Album, love the band","A Day in the Life is good, some other songs are, too, but I think Rubber Soul or Magical Mystery Tour should have been the Beatles 'Album of the Year' award winner. (R.S. in `65 and MMT in `67). I know that this was the most original concept but I don't see where it won album of the year. I love the Beatles, so it's not a crime for me to say this. But other Beatles albums should have won the '..of the Year' award."
3,Ignorance is bliss...,"Sgt Pepper's is what the more ignorant of music fans list as a great album. They say it's the best because they think they're supposed to. The title track and Day In The Life are okay, but the rest can drag mightily. Abbey Road and Revolver beat the crap out of Sgt. Peppers. I'd even rate Let It Be, The White Album, and Rubber Soul over it."
4,wow,"It may not be the best Beatles CD, but I have a hard time picking out a better album that is not by the Beatles (as a band or solo). If you like classic music, you'll love Sgt. Petter."
4,Iconic Beatles Album - a must-have,"This is one of the most significant albums The Beatles ever put out and is one of the most important releases of popular music ever. Musically it is diverse with bitter-sweet ballads, whimsical love songs, rockers and vaguely psychedelic cuts jumbled together showing the various routes The Beatles would follow subsequently.Of the songs ""A Day in the Life"" and ""She's Leaving Home"" stand out as evocative and powerful ballads while there are a number of more up-tempo feel-good numbers also included. All in all the content is excellent and many of The Beatles best-loved songs are to be found on this album. There is something in this album for everyone but it is unlikely that many will like all of it. It is not the greatest of Beatles albums but certainly ranks as one of the most interesting and important. Recommended."
4,Tour de Force!,"""Sgt. Pepper"" was something of a transitional album for the Beatles as it gives a nod to psychedelia and mainstream pop. Listening to ""A Day in the Life"" is akin to taking an acid trip while ""She's Leaving Home"" is almost a variation of ""Eleanor Rigby."" This amalgamation of the ""newer"" and ""older"" Beatle sounds make for an interesting listening experience. There's not a bad cut on this album and George Martin's production talents also shine here. The booklet that accompanies this CD makes for interesting reading too. Although ""Abbey Road"" is a stronger, more straight ahead rock 'n' roll album, ""Sgt. Pepper"" is a more colorful and interesting album. If nothing else, SP gave rise to art rock and it rightly deserves all the accolades it gets. Truly, SP is a classic rock album that sounds as fresh and innovative today as it did back in 1967. Even if you're not a Beatles fan, this is one album you'll want to have in your collection."
2,All Time Overrated,"While it can be argued that this album may have proved to be the major catalyst for the flower power generation. As far as I am concerned it's the most overrated piece of vinyl ever released. I also love all the bloated, pseudo-intellectualized analysis put forth in an effort to legitimize the worth of this over produced mass of noise. The final insult is that real rock groups like the Stones wasted time, effort, and my money trying to immitate it rather than dismissing it as the flash in the pan, ""latest thing"", tortured opus that it actually represents in the continum of rock music."
3,That should really be 3&1/2 stars,"While this is a great album,it certainly isn't the best. The best ones were The white album ( I don't care what anyone says about Rev.9) Rubber Soul and Revolver.-In my opinion.I too am 15 and I don't think people who grew up during the 60's & 70's get how truly awful most modern music is. Especially when compared to stuff like this."
3,Revolver & Rubber Soul both much better than Sgt. Pickle,"Don't believe the hype about this Beatle collection ... yes, it has amazing peaks at its beginning and ending, but it also has incredibly-low valleys in-between. John Lennon himself never thought much of this album, or how it became to be known as a ""concept"" album--The Wall by Pink Floyd is a concept album, not this. What bogs Sgt. Pepper down are the middle cuts (I was about to talk about album sides) ""Fixing A Hole,"" ""She's Leaving Home,"" ""Mr. Kite,"" ""Within/Without You"" ""Good Morning"" these ALL sound so uninspired and subpar especially for a group as talented as the Beatles--maybe too much of the lysergic, eh lads? ... Get ""Revolver""--a TRUE Beatle classic, then check out the almost-just-as-magnificent ""Rubber Soul."""
3,"This album is not art, and it's not good either.","Sargent pepper's is a real let-down. Once you get beyond the cover art and the psychedelic sound (which only a hippie-brought-back-from-cryonic-freeze could relate to) the rest of it is just McCartneyesque mush with one song by Harrison on sitar. This is actually worse than the White Album when it comes to a divergence in sound from the three main singers. With a Little Help...is probably Starkey's best, but that is not saying much. I'd opt for Abbey Road, if you don't have it yet."
3,Overrated!,"Good, yes, but there are at least 5 better Beatles albums. Lennon seemed to have some interesting input; McCartney crooned out some cheesy songs, but nothing outstanding here, A Day In The Life being the sole exception."
1,Another remaster disaster,"Almost every 'remastered' CD I have bought is horrible, and worse than the original releases (with the exception of the Dire Straights CDs).As is the case with the Genesis Trick of the Tail CD, there is no bass, and the highs are exaggerated beyond belief, accentuating sibilance to the point of extreme irritation. DON'T BUY THIS CD! Try to find the older version.I am incensed at this recording and how once again the remasters are a failure.Be sure you understand what ""helpful"" means before you say this review is not helpful. It doesn't mean you agree with me!!!!!"
2,Vaguely Interesting Mis-Fire From Usually Consistent Band,"George Martin's pristine production saves this disappointing follow-up to the classic ""Revolver."" Song content consists of embarrasing odes to travelling shows, imaginary bands, and psychedelic songs about plants and nature, all with negligable emotional resonance. Band quickly saw this artistic path as a dead end and headed for more rewarding territory on ""The White Album."" Still beloved by a minority for some obscure nostalgic appeal, it's lasting influence is only visible in such minor performers as Lenny Kravitz and Klaatu."
2,knock off,"This album sucks. It's a total rip off of Pet Sounds. What, did Ringo write the whole thing. They should have kept Stu Sutcliffe. Enough Sitar already. Plus, what the heck are marshmallow skies. Who is this Mr. Kite guy anyway, and what posseses him to waltz with a horse. Really, now."
3,"Quite good, I say...","No doubt about the relevance and importance of this Beatles record,but it's not the greatest album ever made.Still,it is a very good album with some beautiful songs.The Lennon songs(written by the man himself)are the greatest songs.Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds(the LSD song)is truly stunning as is Day in the Life.My favorite song is Within or Without You with that Sitar sound,which came from the Beatles trip to Sitar legend Ravi Shankar.The McCartney songs are not even close to the Lennon tracks since they are pretty cheezy and not experimental.Important,very important,but not a masterpiece.It is also not a typical Beatles record,cause if you listen to their best of records(I've got the album 1)not a single Sgt. Pepper song is included.Not that that's a problem though.For Beatles starters I would recommend the great 1 album that shows a more recognisable Beatles sound."
2,no respect,"The lyrics are about all that this band had going for them. This by most definitions is NOT rock music- this is pop, plain and simple- it's this nonsense that led to the untalented Ricky Martins, Lou Begas and Backstreet Boys of today.Plus, I cannot respect a band who fires their original drummer (Pete Best) because he was too talented."
2,Not so big ...,"The Beatles were great. In the greater scope of their work, I don't think this album is so much better or worse than the others. Much to the contrary, I don't like it. It has so much studios gimmick running around, we can't possibly know who is playing what in each track. Boring, indulgent and mindless album."
4,Must have seemed like music from another dimension...,"Due to my age I was never able to exeprience this record upon its initial release, and thus I can only attempt to appreciate the level of psychadelic awe in which this surely produced in the first wave of listeners. For those in the mainstream who had no knowledge of avant garde music this must have surely sounded like a musical gift from a strange and distant dimension, and I presume that changed many listeners' perception of reality and art."
3,A good album BUT!,"I feel this album rests on the quality of 2 songs. ""A DAY IN THE LIFE"" (BY FAR THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM) AND ""GETTING BETTER"". There is alot of filler on this album after those 2 great songs. So I don't think as a whole it stands up to the truly great ""Revolver"". Which I really believe is their MASTERPIECE!!!"
3,What remastering?,"A friend of mine bought this cd today and brought it over to my house. We compared his new ""remastered"" copy with my original. The only difference is that his was louder. That's it. No clearer, no more noticeable bass or drums. Nothing. Don't waste your time buying this ""remastered"" version, since you're not missing out on anything but a few decibels. The reason I still give this a 3 star is because it is one of my favorite Beatles albums, and is well worth your time to listen to."
4,Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"The main reason I got the Sgt. Pepper's album is because of the accolade that it's number uno on Rolling Stone's magazine of ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time,"" but I don't agree with them. It's a matter of opinion of course.You have your slow catchy melody ""With A Little Help From My Friends,"" a song I first heard by Joe Cocker, you got the classic ""Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds,"" you got your optimistic ""Getting Better,"" you got the spectacular rhythm of ""Fixing a Hole,"" and the rest of the songs take you on a creative journey. Other catchy Catchy songs that I liked were the wonder of ""When I'm Sixty-Four,"" upbeat ""Lovely Rita,"" the brilliant ""Good Morning, Good Morning,"" and the extraordinary last track."
1,Bad pressing quality,"My copy of SGT Pepper had similar quality problems as described in other reviews -- horrible surface noise, one channel cutting on/off, spindle hole off center so doesn't spin properly. I returned it -- the second copy better but not great.Also had similar issues with the White Album."
4,Good But Overrated.,"The Beatles were one of the best bands around back then and still are today. It's essential and most of the songs are good but it's extremely overrated. I'd pick Revolver or Abbey Road over this any day. It was very unique for the time, that's why it's more popular. Some people don't like The Beatles because they think they're overrated. Their music is popular for a reason and most of their music's good, even their most overrated. It's not the very best though, their music before Sgt. Pepper doesn't get as much attention. Rubber Soul and Revolver are amazing, those are five star albums. Fixing A Hole, She's Leaving Home, A Day In the Life, When I'm Sixty Four and Sgt. Pepper are the best and are great songs however Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds and With A Little Help From My Friends are overrated in my opinion. After all this was one of the first albums in psychedelic rock and it popularized the genre but now it sounds outdated in parts. Revolver holds up with age much better."
5,A true rock-n-roll classic,"It's hard to figure out what *hasn't* been said about this album. ""Sgt. Pepper"" was a real departure for the Beatles, branching out into such highly experimental production techniques as back-masking (cutting up tape and intersplicing it upside-down and backwards to obtain completely different sounds). There are no particularly weak cuts on this album, but some rank higher in my ""list of favorites"" than others. My absolute favorite track is ""Lovely Rita Metermaid,"" for its interesting counterpoint and harmonic structure. As with most folks, I love the opening cuts, ""Sgt. Pepper/With a Little Help from My Friends,"" but am especially fond of the more raucous ""Sgt. Pepper (Reprise)"" that comes later in the album. If I were to create one of those ""desert island disc"" lists that you see periodically, ""Sgt. Pepper"" would absolutely be included. This is a ""must"" for any album collection."
3,Production trumps Content,"For me the mark of a great song is its ability to stand up to any interpretation, arrangement or production. Perhaps that's why there have been so many covers of ""Yesterday"". The songs on ""Pepper"" do not meet that standard. Many people feel this album is a pinnacle for the Beatles. While that may be with respect to their innovation in the studio, without the dazzling production many of the songs do not hold up. Proof of this can be seen on Elton John's cover version of ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"". In the pop combo arrangement it loses all effect. Lennon's witty, arcane lyrics are propped up by the equally arty arrangement. This album is a step down from the previous ""Revolver"" where production didn't overshadow the strong songwriting. Here production is a crutch for some of the weakest songs the group ever wrote."
2,Not their best,"When Sgt. Pepper came out I was 12. I liked it a lot back then. Now that I've been exposed to life I see how blatantly self-indulgent the Beatles were in this album (the fans' feedback was permanently removed from their process after 1965). But still, Sgt. Pepper is an okay effort. The tracks from this album that have stood the test of time are ""Getting Better"" and ""Lucy."" But nothing on Sgt. Pepper ranks up there with the power of such songs as ""In My Life"" & ""Yesterday."""
3,Sergeant Pepper,The list of albums from this era that have stood the test of time better than this is simply too lengthy to mention. Maybe it sounded good at one time but there is better 1960s music than this.
4,Unity of emotion ....,"33 years ago I was struck by how I had just listened to a musical work and not a collection of disconnected tracks by a given artist. After untold replays the realization slowly came to me ... the unifing emotion of this album ... as nearly as I can define it in a single word ... the emotion that cried out from each track ... is loneliness. Of course you may not feel it or feel something quite different. But that is what makes this a ""concept"" album and one of the greatest of the rock era ... that it is a single opus."
1,One word: Outfake!,"This caused a storm of controversy when it first hit the collector's market in the late 1980's. At that time, Sgt Pepper outtakes were very few and far between, so here comes this LP which promised alternate mixes from the LP (not just the usual alternate mixes from the released MONO version). So I bought it (my seller almost stopped me because I was such a good customer, but didn't want to say anything with another customer close by) and take it home and give it a listen. This is nothing more than a poorly done remix of the Pepper LP to give the illusion of being outtakes, but are nothing of the sort. Whoever did this should be ashamed of themselves. Bottom line, this album is absolute garbage. Don't buy it, buy the Anthology CD's instead for the real thing."
3,The most spoiled album in rock and roll,"This album was spoiled to death in the studio! The trickery and excess junk used on this album is too much! The songs are mediocre, only ""A Day in the Life"" sticks out as notable. You would expect better from this otherwise wonderful band. Only the Beatles could have gotten away with this overindulgence. Most of the songs seem to be the product of excessive drug use. Where did such magnificent writers get the idea for songs like ""Fixing A Hole"" and ""Good Morning Good Morning"" ?"
2,"The Stones ""Exile on Main Street"" is a far superior album","""Peppers"" can't touch ""Exile"" as an album and should not be even considered among the top albums of all time. The Beatles work depended on heavy studio production, and this album is no exception. Go to the Stones section and pick up any one of their myriad albums and you will not be dissapointed."
4,NOT the best album of all the time...,"... but the Beatles' 1967 masterpiece, ""Sgt. Pepper,"" is still an excellent addition to any collection. The album has been overhyped with the-greatest-album-ever cheerleading, but that honor goes to the Beatles self-titled double-album (""White Album"").That being said, this one is too indulgent, with such lackluster pieces as McCartney's 'Fixing a Hole' and Lennon's 'Good Morning, Good Morning' thrown in with such classics as 'When I'm 64' and 'A Day in the Life.' Also, this album was meant to be heard as a whole, and until it's reissued with ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""Penny Lane,"" it's not a whole. Buy this after you have 'Beatles 1' and 'The White Album.'"
2,Buyer Beware,"... because while the beginning and end of Sgt. Pepper is good, the valley in between is very wide. It's as if the producer put the weakest songs (Mr. Kite and Within You Without You) exactly in the middle of the track listing. Beatle fans make excuses for them such as ""they are different"" or ""if you listen to it 10 times it starts to get not so bad""...but they are weak..."
2,Beatles on Drugs,"So I bought the mono box set and heard this album for the first time in its entirety. I was prepared to be disappointed and was still disappointed. With this box set I've gained a new respect for the early albums while later work is hit or miss and this album misses for the most part. Little help from my friends is a good song that Joe Cocker made fairly great. LSD is a great song don't get me wrong but the only other one I like is a Day in the Life so I can't give this more than 2 stars despite all the hoopla. I've listened to Rubber Soul for the first time also and it is really a great album though I still think Revolver is better, Revolver being a stunning work in my opinion. Magical Mystery Tour is actually (much) better than Sgt Peppers but it came out after so doesn't get groundbreaking credit... or something. I just find the Sgt Pepper songs lacking, self-indulgent with little redeeming value."
2,Shameful Packaging,"42 years later and Sgt. Pepper is as brilliant as ever...enough said, further accolades superfluous. However, how can anybody justify the sale of such an iconic cd in a cardboard envelope? Shame on you Amazon and E.M.I.! Would a simple, elegant crystal cover have cut that much into the bottom line?"
3,"Good, but doesn't live up","My sister is a huge beatles fan and i've heard so much about this album. It seemed too poppy and is not a concept album by any reach of the mind. Though, she's leaving home, getting better, and good morning, good morning are my favorites on the album. Lucy.. A day ... blah blah blah. My love for George Harrison proves well with the crazy within you without you, my favorite. Its good but the most essential album is revolver or rubber soul"
3,Whaaaaaaatttttt???????,"This is a good album, but no the greatest of all, this is nothing compared with the dark side of the moon..... if you want to listen to something really good, try New Model Army, Pink Floyd, David Bowie and the list goes on."
2,Sgt. Pepper - 1967,"""I gave Pepper five stars because I don't believe that the Beatles are capable of making an album with less stars."" Oh, please.First of all, there are a number of Beatle albums, although good, that don't rate as high as some of the best works by numerous groups of 60s & 70s including Led Zep, Pink Floyd and Hendrix. What unbiased reviewer would rate ""Yellow Submarine"" 5 stars?As far as Sgt. Pepper - the first track is great. The last track is great. The middle of the album is very mediocre. Two tracks can't save the album, but they each get a star. And this album has dated over time. It sounds old, while the better 5-star albums still sound fresh."
3,A powerless and no volume album that is retarted,"This album was written by a freak in Lennon and a retard in Mcartney. I mean who care about Lucy with her damm diamounds in the sky! What the hell does that mean anyway. Face it it was also over rated even as a concept album, The Best album of 1967 was THE WHO SELLS OUT it had power volume and it made a sense. Yes it was on the acid side a little but it always stayed as a good rock album. The little radio commercials were a great concept by Townshend and Entwistle. Plus THE WHO had a better drummer a better guitar player a way better base player and a great front man . So all im saying is that this album and the beatles suck and are over rated. I mean WHO lasted longer?"
3,read on...,"sgt. peppers lonely hearts club band is without a doubt the singular most overrated album in the history of popular culture, music, or rock n roll. it was recently rated as number one on rolling stones top 500 greatest albums ever. no. no it should not have been. revolver is without a doubt the definetive beatles album. although this album changed many things in the way music was made. the production, the overall concept, the whole thing changed music forever. but still i ask myself how, and why. sure there are some real good cuts on here. the title track, lucy in the sky, little help, and a day in the life are really the only good cuts on this album. of course if you're trying to collect all the essential albums every band has ever made, of course you need to get this. but if you're just getting into the beatles, get revolver, or the white album"
4,Find yourself a mono copy of the LP and then compare the 2...,"Many differences between the mono and stereo versions. See for yourself, its fun!"
1,"I mean, really. . . .","Give it up, folks. You people have liked what you have been told to like all your lives and, by God, Sgt. Pepper is the big daddy of all ""must like"" cool things. Get a clue. Break away from your generic ""originality""!"
2,Dated,"If you were around in 1967, buy it for the nostalgia. If not, I guarantee you that it will sound old and dated relative to today's music, as well as the music of the 90s, 80s, and 70s, and even some of the good music of the 1960s.Track by track:Sgt. Pepper - good, really rocks, sounds good even todayHelp From My Friends - datedLucy - touted as psychedelic, but not reallyGetting Better - adequate song now used for commercialsFixing A Hole - weakShe's Leaving Home - not rock, weak orchestra backed songMr. Kite - very weakWithin You - self indulgent song that Paul/John had to let George put on the album64 - weak, vaudeville like song. Doesn't belong on a rock albumLovely Rita - adequateGood Morning - zzzSgt. Pepper - good, but just a rerun of track oneDay in the Life - two unfinished songs by John and Paul that George Martin spliced together. OK.Altogether was OK in 1967, but dated 35 years later as expected."
1,Worst Album of the Millennium,If people had been making albums for the last 1000 years they could not have made a worse album than Sgt. Pepper. It's that awful. But go ahead and defend it if you must. It does make for some catchy commercials.
1,Over-inflated Piffle!,"Just try getting through Mr. Kite or Within You Without you. A condescending middle finger to the fans that appreciated of them as a rock and roll band. By this point in their careers (read:millionaires), the Beatles knew the cound serve any pretentious **** they wanted. They just didn't CARE. Search Yoko Ono for the for the complete artistic emasculation of John Lennon."
1,A Day In the Life / plus 12 other songs,People often offer the opinion that the artwork was the major breakthrough of this album. I agree. It couldn't have been this music.
5,Freshly Remastered and Miraculous,"Without debating the merits of the original music, the remastering on this CD is nothing short of phenomenal. No, it is not an exact recreation of the original, compressed 4 track recording on vinyl. That muddy warm sound was state of the art for its day, but that day is over. This newly remastered CD sounds so fresh, so cutting edge, that it unchains the original LP and makes it relevant again. Sgt. Pepper has been called the greatest rock album of all time. Now 21st century fans will be able to judge for themselves. It's still one of the baddest kids on the block, the rocket launcher for all modern rock."
5,This album doesn't need my review,"This album is a classic and doesn't need my input, but I felt the need to respond to ""A Fair and Balanced Rater"". Assuming your review isn't a joke, you might want to check your calendar: Sgt. Pepper's Loney Hearts Club Band was released June 1, 1967 while Dark Side of The Moon was released March 2, 1973. I'd be interested in hearing your explanation as to how The Beatles ripped off Pink Floyd."
3,cool,"this is a good one, although i feel like the title song is a little uninteresting, i love what it leads into, ""A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS"" is a fun time song, one of Ringo's best. i love ""LOVELY RITA"" its sweet and innocent just like the beatles are known to be, i wish music today was innocent like this. ""WITHIN WITHOUT"" id say is a little strange but it is really cool, its not radio worthy but its pretty cool, ""FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE"" is just plain wierd, its interesting. i love the album cover, its packed with things to look at, this is a great album, its a classic and always will be remembered as such"
5,review,"Remastered, who could ask for more? The music is clearer and well I am a Beatle fan, had to have it."
5,The Greatest Album Ever!,"I was reading the other reviews here, and the kid is the only one who gets it right. This is a terrific album! If you're like me and the weird, trippy Beatles music is your favorite, this album is for you! Don't listen to those other people, they're crazy! Buy it and enjoy it!""A Day in the Life,"" is my favorite Beatle song, by the by."
2,Disappointing,"While it is certainly a matter of taste, this CD is rather boring. Being the great tele player that he is, Redd could have done much better than this piece of typical draggy Nashville sound. If you like good tele playing that sounds like hell then get yourself ""The Nashville Guitars"". Only the title song ""No stranger to a Tele"" comes remotely close to the awesome sound of the guys of ""The Nashville Guitars"". The rest sounds more like Chet Atkins forty years ago. Disappointing."
4,Great Bakersfield Style Guitar,"While I didn't like all of this album as much as his first one, Telewacker, No Stranger to a Tele is still a must own. If you love the Bakersfield sound that Redd supplies to Merle Haggard and his band the Strangers, then you'll appreciate this album. My favorites are the instrumentals, especially the title track (which pays homage to Haggard's Mama Tried). But Volkaerts vocals are superb too. This is just a good time album that's fun to listen to and will undoubtedly find it's way to your CD player over and over."
1,HUGE WARNING,"These cards are not The Writing Road to Reading Phonogram Cards that are used with the Spalding Method. They are written by Myrna McCulloch and used for The Writing and Spelling Road to Reading and Thinking Method, which is very different from the Spalding Method. There are a few similarities - but I can't use them in the classroom.The Writing Road to Reading Phonogram Cards"
3,"interesting and clever, but fairly shallow","I Was A Teenage Fairy by Francesca Lia BlockBlock's unique, trippy poetic prose fills this book about a spunky fairy that helps two teenage models/actors that were molested as children by a photographer. Playing with Peter Pan, the supermodel culture, and fairy folklore (changeling tales, glamour and obsession with physical beauty), she creates a modernist tale that is more about the dreamy writing style than substance. Grade: B"
4,"Fashion model finds inner confidence, finally.","Though not as satisfying as the Weetzie Bat books, I Was a Teenage Fairy is a very enjoyable and memorable book. The main character, Barbie, (yes, she is named after the ubiquitous fashion doll), is taken on a journey dealing with pain, loneliness, confusion, abuse, and inner turmoil--you know, everyday life for most of us. What is different about her journey is the people that she meets along the way. Think independence and personal acceptance. Fans of Block's writing will not be disappointed. When someone mentions the name ""Barbie,"" perhaps because of this book, the doll won't be the first image that is thought of. In all, a great book, and a great introduction to Block's style, if you are new to her writings."
2,"nice try, francesca","I have read close to all of this authors books but this one left me disappointed. Block's lyrical writing fell short this time. I felt like I had read it all before. Enough about the jacaranda trees, Francesca, we get the point. Purple trees in LA. Maybe I didn't like this book b/c the writing style was just an attempt at recreating her other books. A lousy attempt. Or maybe it's b/c I live in LA and I know what it's like already. But it all just seemed to cliche to me. The stage mom and the uninterested girl. It's been done. I really didn't feel that the characters developed at all. They were presented and weren't displayed in any more depth for the rest of the book. Oh well, there's always Weetzie. (However, if you've never read any of her books before read this one. You'll enjoy it b/c you won't have such high expectations. And then read the rest b/c it will just get better and better.)"
1,A truly disappointing effort from a remarkable writer,"Readers of Francesca Lia Block's gorgeous, lyrical prose will be sorely disappointed by her latest novel. This book contains little of the offbeat charm and irreverance of Block's earlier works; even her normally beautiful language seems stilted and pretentious. The characters in the novel are one-dimensional and Block, usually so good at evoking emotion, does not seem to be able to rescue them from the confines of the page. Much of what makes the novel so disappointing is the feeling that she has rendered all of these characters much more fully and luminously in her other works. I'm not sure if Block is finished with the Weetzie Bat series, but if she is looking for a new series of characters, she hasn't found them in ""I Was A Teenage Fairy."" Those new to Block's work should try ""Witch Baby,"" ""Cherokee Bat and the Goat Guys,"" or ""Missing Angel Juan"" to glimpse this extraordinary writer at her finest."
3,not my favorite of Block's so far,"I enjoy Francesca Lia Block's work because of the beautiful language and imagery. 'I Was A Teenage Fairy' did not disappoint in this area, but this was definitely not my favorite book of hers so far. I liked the idea of Mab coming to Barbie and Griffin, who both experienced the same trauma in their lives, and their differences in dealing with their pain. The idea of a tiny fairy living in your purse or your flowers like a constant miniature best friend is comforting and made me wish I had one! 'I Was A Teenage Fairy' was a quick read (I read it within 24 hours), the language and imagery as always making the book a great escape, and had a satisfying happy ending. I would recommend this book to fans of Block's work, but maybe not the best book to start out with if you've never read Francesca Lia Block before."
1,Very disappointing,"I have been a fan of Ms. Block since Weetzie Bat, and I anxiously await the arrival of any new book. Unfortunately, IWATF was a huge disappointment. Her choice to give her main character the painfully obvious name of ""Barbie"" seemed like a slap in the face. How unoriginal. And the name of the book itself was irksome, a goofy title where magic could have been made. On the whole, I found no truly loveable characters and felt everyone was too spoiled to care about. Violet and Claire continued the trend, and now I hope upon hope that her next book will return to the punk rock slink-chunk charm of Weetzie Bat or the lyrical mystery of The Hanged Man or the inspiring magic of Girl Goddess. Anything but this."
3,"Short, Not so sweet, and to the point","This book for me was just okay. I t was kinof flat, and didnt have much adventure or intersting parts in it. The book centers around barbie, griffin, barbies boyfriend,(all rebel teenagers) and Mab, a fairy smart allec. Mab was the only reason i kept on reading. without her, the book really would have been bad!"
5,"intricate, touching and beautiful","I may no longer be a teenager, but when I saw this book, I could not resist purchasing it and reading it at once. I became captivated with Ms. Block's work through Dangerous Angels (the Weetzie Bat books, so much an influence that I named my beloved cat ""WitchBaby""). I was a Teenage Fairy kept me equally as spellbound. Blending horrific reality with imagination and beauty, Barbie and Mab are a wonderful pair. This is a gorgeous book, that I recommend for anyone."
5,Wonderful,"I loved this book almost as much, or actually, as much as her book Violet and Clair. I could see and feel and touch Mab, the fairy. It was really amazing and I feel now as if I have a Mab that lives with me. I read it in less than a day (in class....:) It was really great, and I would recomend it to anyone who believes in fairies."
5,Not for immature or naive kids,"I've read most of the other reviews about how this book is horrible and so forth and so on because of the subject matter. While this book probably shouldn't be on a list for 12 and up, if a kid is honestly still so naive by the time they are entering highschool that they can't handle this book, maybe its good they are being exposed to the world. The book discusses sex, drinking, being molested, nothing more than is talked about on Oprah or Dr. Phil. Parents may not be ready for their 8th grader to be exposed to this, but its definitely the real world. I read this book going into the 7th grade and it didn't hurt me to read it, it just opened my eyes to a life I had never experienced. The book is well written and will suck you in if you are open minded enough to read it."
5,full of glittering and lyrical smiles to lift your heart,"at the age of 15, this is one of my very favourite books. i loved it so much i had to go out and buy it. this book is full of emotion and if you read it, it will forever enthrall you. this book taught me things that no person ever could. i love this book so very much, and i suggest any teenage girl (whos really a faerie on the inside, like myself) read this magical book."
4,fairy of a teenage girl,"I Wasa a Teenage Fairy by Fransesca Dia Block was a very magical, invigorating, bizarre, and startling story. I loved this story. It had a realistic feel with a fairy tale twistThis story is about a girl, Barbie, who is forced by her mother to model. Her mom didn't make it as a model and thought she could fix her mistakes through her daughter. When she was about 8 she met a fairy named Mab. Mab was about 4 in. tall with a 8 foot tall sex drive, she had the attitude of a girl with permanent p.m.s.Something happened at one of her modling shoots that would change her forever. Barbie wanted to tell her mom but couldn't, Even if she wanted to her mom wouldn't listen. If it wasn't for Mab all of Barbies feelings would be locked up inside.16 year old Barbie, more beautiful than ever still being forced to model. Barbie meets a some friends and enimies that will change her life always.This was a great book and I recomend it to you who have just read my review."
2,Disappointing,"I love all of Francesca Lia Block's books except for ""I Was A Teenage Fairy"". This book doesn't have any of the magic or silliness of Miss Block's other books. The only character that was remotely interesting was ""Mab"". I hope the next book is better then this!"
2,Fairy Tale?,"I'm sorry, but I can't follow the crowd on this one. I really didn't enjoy it. I found it disjointed, distasteful and disappointing. Let's face it, the fairy type creature Mabs was a bitch. She was never happy, was constantly whining and was generally in-fairylike. I mean, fairy tales are supposed to be uplifting. All little girls either want to be a fairy or a princess. Had they met this Mabs character they would all narrow that decision down to being a princess.And what about the main character? Miss snooty model? I don't know, there was something off putting about every character in this book. Even if they all do live happily ever after by the end, I see divorce, drugs and alcoholism in their futures. Anyway, I would suggest this book to nobody and am even feeling leery about passing it along to Value Village in case some poor sap picks it up for $2.99."
4,Realistic,"First off, I am an avid fan of Francesca Lia Block and have read basically everything she has ever written. I read this book for the first time when I was 13, and was stunned at the beauty of Block's honesty. The murky quality of narration is accurate of any coming-of-age story, especially one dealing with the issues addressed in this book. Block's ability to weave fantastical themes into real, contemporary life awes me every times. The discovery of honesty and strength at the end of the book was not only beautifully written but also very powerful for me as a girl struggling with her own life."
5,The best book for fantasy lovers!,"If you would like to read this book you better have alot of time on youre hands because once you start you can't put it down I think this book is addicting! I reccomend this book for 13-18 readers it has a bit of swearing but it makes it better and more interesting it is a bout a fairy who finds a friend the friends name is Barbie, Barbie is the main character. Barbies mother, Ms. Marks puts Barbie under tons of pressure to be a model and become famous But Barbie doesn't like all of the photo shoots The book makes you feel like you are Barbies best friend Barbie grows and she picks up a Boyfriend along the way! I think this is a super book aND IF YOURE A TEENAGER THIS IS A ROMANTIC FANTASY!"
4,It was a great book!!,I think this book is a very cool book! At first though it was sort of boring but then it got very intrusting and turned out great! I like reading wierd books like this one!
2,My first experience with Teenage Faries,"I've never read anything by this woman (girl?). This book was like... Beverly Cleary but ""modern"". It wasn't very involved and seemed like it would have been more accomplished if it had been a children's story book complete with illustrations and such. It was like she started writing this book for a group of friends as a christmas present - complete with allusions that only they can understand in unmentionable detail - and she decided to publish. It left me the whole time wanting more. She gave everyone an out, even villains (Washed-Up-ExModel-Mother and Molesting-Fashion-Photographer) who some people would rather see horribly punished for their crimes against the Pop-Teen-Set... it was a great piece of pop culture that seemed to be written in an unaccounted for MiddleSchool style... I wanted so much more."
2,Eghads,"eeek. Let me start with Block's writing. It is completly prestentious and skin deep. I have read so many of her books and am yet to like on of them. She makes me feel like she thinks we will fall for her big, overly descriptive words. To tell you the truth, I don't think there's much going on underneath the visuals and words of this story or any of Blocks peices. They are very sad tales with insanely happy ending. They are written to cater the teenage mind, as if the teenage mind is a model wannabe idiot. It seems to me that the author assumes we arn't paying attention to the words... that's my opinion..."
2,Argh! Read this!,"I love faeries. they are beautiful amazing creatures that allow people to escape reality. So, as you could expect i was instantly attracted to this book. I regret that. I had my mother buy it for me, and when i got home i read it in about an hour. the beginning is amazing. truly amazing. but the end is weak and dumb. i expected more. the boy barbie hooks up with is extremely vulgar and wrong. this book is not about a faerie or a girl. its simply sexuality. i am 12, and know a lot for a child my age but even for me... this book lakced a good ending. poor. dont buy it."
1,Poor Reading,I bought this book for my 15 year old grand daughter and decided to read it before I gave it to her. I did not think the book was well written. It also was very sexually explicit and not appropriate for someone of that age.
1,"depressing tripe, definately not for young adults....","My review is geared more towards parents and/or other adults being asked to buy this book by their children-this book is just plain horrible! This poor young girl, Barbie, has a wretched stage mom, and a completely uninvolved father. She's forced by mom into modeling, left alone at 12, then molested by the photograper!!! Her mom's answer to this is ""life is full of problems, deal with them"". Even the fairy, Mab, says horrid things to her, and encourages her at 16 to drink, smoke and have sex!!!I cannot believe this is on middle school reading lists, and I'm no prude, this book shouldn't be suggested to anyone under 16 at least. None of these adult subjects are handled in this book with any sensitivity-just titilation value.Horrible! this book is rancid :(no stars."
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this book because of all the great reviews. I returned after looking through it a couple of times. None of the patterns inspired me. I found them quite frumpy and old-fashioned looking. That can be O.K. but if you're looking for more modern or stylish design, this is not the book for you."
3,Nice Patterns - Too Tricky,I have been looking high and low for knitting books that offer simple patterns. I don't consider myself a beginner knitter but I also don't feel up to knitting an Aran Sweater.. no matter how beautiful they are.The book isn't outdated by any means and there are a lot of interesting patterns for experienced knitters but about two for a beginner.My suggestion is to go to www.lionbrand.com and find free patterns there.
5,"benny scott , belgian fan of the 50's music","Great compilation !!!Most important fact : these are the ORIGINAL MONO RECORDINGSof most of Pat's great hits ( with the exception of April Love,in stereo on the CD, but exactly the same version as on the original 45 PM in mono. This means that the song was recorded in stereo but originally released in mono, but was not re-recorded in 1959 ! )Today most of Pat's big hits are released in the re-recorded stereo-versions of 1959. Only the German "" Big Bear Family "" company issued a boxed set "" The Fifties Complete "" containing also all the original mono and stereo-re-recordings of 15 songs.This double CD "" Pat's 40 Big Ones "" was probably issued with the permission of Big Bear Family Records.A REAL MUST for all Pat Boone fans who want the original recordings in true mono !!"
2,Pat's 40 Big Ones,"Purchased this album more than a month ago and have still not received it. Therefore, it sounds terrible. Kinda like the sound of silence."
2,The nadir of Yoko's post-Double Fantasy catalogue,"I am a huge fan of Yoko, I always defend her. However, I felt this album ""Starpeace"" was probably her weakest album.I do think there is one great track though, Hell In Paradise, I would rank that in my Yoko top 3, but besides that, there's very little to recommend off this. Songs like Remember Raven and Children Power are among the weakest, most banal tracks Yoko's ever recorded. Only 4 tracks off this album appear on the 100+ track Onobox, and Yoko doesn't have that many albums.Avoid this and get ""Walking On Thin Ice"", her greatest hits set, which has Hell In Paradise anyways. This album sticks out like a really weak sore thumb in between Season Of Glass/It's Alright and Rising/Blueprint For A Sunrise"
5,Love it!,"It was so much fun to play! Out of my 100 games collection, it's in the top 20 despite its an old game. Its graphic isn't bad. In my opinion, PC game should be about fun. It provides that!"
5,Outstanding!!,I got these some time ago for my spoiled rotten beagle...and he's even more spoiled now...a bit thinner but still overly spoiled! They're wonderful and very few calories.
3,Too Small,"My dog loves pig ears (what dog doesn't)? These, however, are too small for my comfort. I have a Great Dane, and am always afraid that she'll swallow it whole (or mostly whole), rather than chewing it. So far we haven't had any problems, which is good. I'd like to see the product come in a size meant for giant dogs."
3,"Tasty, made in USA, but not very durable....","These seem tasty, my dog loves them. They say they are made in USA and all natural, which is good.However, my dog devours these ears in about 20 minutes. The other pig ears we bought in the pet store take him 2-4 days to completely chew up... But these don't even last an hour.FWIW, my dog is a 3 month old doberman."
2,Smokehouse pig ears with no smoke...,"Smokehouse 100-Percent Natural Smoked Pig Ears Dog Treats, 24-PackI was disappointed in the quality of this product. The pig ears where supposed to have been ""smoked"" but they have zero smoke smell and almost smell a little on the spoiled side. The pig ears cost $1.25 each when you buy them in the 24 count bag which is the same price I can buy non-smoked pig ears locally at Petco and Pet Smart. Also the size of the pig ears are on the small side compared to similar products I have purchased in the past at the same price from other suppliers. There is nothing really wrong with the product, my Boxer will chew them up regardless. I guess I was expecting a higher grade pig ear based on the Amazon product description than what I actually received."
5,AMAZING!!,"This CD is now my all time favorite. When Deep Forest made their first album, I totally loved it. Then they made their second.. and though it was good, it missed the deep trance like feeling I got from their first, same with the third and with the Enigma albums... this CD is wonderful! It starts out great and ends awesome! Any fan of Deep Forest, Enigma, Sacred Spirits... you have to own this album... I can express to you how wonderful this cd is! Buy it... you wont regret it!"
3,One man's perspective...,"I'm eternally grateful to Dannion Brinkley for having written his books and sharing his three NDEs... amazing stories. He comes down on the side of challenging times ahead, backed by the accuracy (so far) of 117 predictions the ""Council of Thirteen"" has given him, along with the forecast. Not all in depth NDEs do so. I'm not 100% sure of ""channeled"" entities such as Abraham, Adam and Pursah. Could it be that those on the other side are as subjective as we? Nonetheless, Dannion gives us what he believes is a set of ""rules"" to live by, useful, I'm sure. I kind of like to figure out my own ""guidelines"" based upon the facts as shared by various authors. To me, the facination of NDEs comes from the sharing of the description, not from the preaching that follows."
4,Another challenging workout! I love Jari!,"This is another straightforward and challenging workout from Jari Love! I like that you can do just the cardio workout, just the strength training workouts, or the combination workouts. They aren't as long as some others out there which is important for me since I have a toddler and need to get in my workout and get going to my other responsibilities.I like that modifications are offered and that in the beginning of each segment they tell you how many reps and sets you'll be doing. For me, it helps me mentally make it through set 3, knowing there are only 4 sets, for example. My only wish was that there were different ab segments. The same two ab segments are used for each combination workout. Other than that, I'd highly recommend this for all around intense workout for both cardio and strength training!"
4,Not bad,This isn't a bad workout. It gets your heartrate up but a lot like workouts I have done before. Not too advanced but more intermediate.
3,Not as good as ER1000 but still a good workout,"I really enjoyed ER1000 and wanted to try another dvd from Jari but this one just didn't do it for me...Like some other viewer said, it's very repetitive - I didn't think it'd bother me but it did... you do 6 sets for almost every move and each set is lengthy, so it kinda put me off as I was looking for variations, working in different areas.In her cool down section, she didn't stretch the upper body at all, which surprised me as there were a lot of shoulder workouts.It's still a good workout though"
2,Not her best work,"LOVED Jari's Ripped 1000 and this was a disappointment in comparison. BORING, repetitive, and not as tough. Still a good workout, but definitely not her best."
5,short and sweet,"short, simple, and I like that you can alter the moves for whatever level you are at! I use this three times a week."
2,Not what I thought!,"This video will provide a hard workout, but it is very high impact. There is a lot of jumping in every segment! Anyone with joint issues should avoid this one. And though you can modify, if you are modifying almost every activity, your workout will suffer. Also, maybe I did not read carefully enough to know that to do the program to its fullest potential, you need an aerobic step. I do not have one and do not want to get one. I did the workouts without the step and it was odd. You can pretend to have a step, but it throws things off. Finally, the routine is boring. She does the same exercise for as many as five sets per side--way too much for my attention span. I may use this once in awhile, but I have other DVDs I like much better."
1,Get Extremely RIPPED! 1000 Hardcore,I did not like this DVD. I have never purchased Jari Love DVD before and probably will not purchase any more of her workouts.
5,Brilliant,"I have most of Jari Love's dvds and this is definitely one of the best. I cannot recommend it enough. I also have a lot of other fitness dvds and Jari Love is simply the best. If you are considering buying a fitness dvd definitely get this one, you will not regret it."
2,Everything described in the review doesn't arrive with order,"The review talked about the CD-ROM and work book that comes with the book. These were offered at my local bookstore, but did not arrive with my order.Amazon told me the work book would have to be ordered separately, from an outside website.Don't order from Amazon if you need the other two items."
4,Great condition and fast shipping,"Book was as described, in very good condition, and shipping was fast. I would recommend this seller and will use again."
2,mediocre,"I read this book after reading the review of others. I have to say this book will not go into my library of books to keep. I really expected alot better from this author, since his books continue to sell despite his death.The book had little action, and did not excite me. I found the confrontation at the end to be the most exciting part of the book! Really thought it could of used more action throughout.Most of the book was building its way to the final 4 chapters, guess what I am trying to say was that I was really just plain disappointed by this author."
4,Good purchase,"Color and size exactly what I anticipated. Very easy to attached to its matching bedframe. Comes mostly put together, required a lot less time and thought to complete than I was expecting. Is lightweight but solid, a good purchase for the price."
1,Very very suspicious reviews.,It appears someone is falsifying reviews for this book. Most of the reviews are written in broken or odd english. Most reviewers have either reviewed no other products or have only reviewed other products by the publisher. Not sure what's going on here but very very suspicious. Buyer beware.
3,Disappointing,"It literally is a book of contracts, with no explanations. While not mentioned in the marketing materials on Amazon, the CD-ROM is MS Windows only (buyer beware). A better book is the Nolo.com ""Web Software Development: A Legal Guide"". It provides a CD-ROM with contracts in standard formats, plus highly readable explanations of the issues involved."
5,useful,"I cannot believe how much this book helped me over the course of developing my office. Things were always a mess when dealing with compuer software paperwork but this bundle really saved my life, i never thought that i could get such an efficient workforce by getting them to use this set. I am vry satisfied, my work sped up and i'm orofiting even more,i find this book very useful and a must for every office"
5,Nothing Else Even Compares!,"This book is excellent!Ignore the negative review that was given by that one person, if you check his history, you'll notice that he has given poor reviews of several other books sold on Amazon.com... Some people just have nothing positive to say about anything in life.This is a great book and I highly recommend it."
1,Worst Murder Mystery Book Ever Written!!!!,"The only thing shocking about ""Shock Radio""is how horrible it is. It is poorly written, predictable, full of excessive gore and has no decent characters! I managed to read the whole novel, but I had to force myself to do it. The main character is so rude and stupid that 50 pages into the book I was hoping the serial killer would kill him! Don't waste your time on this one, you'll regret it! Overall- Pathetic!!"
5,Excellent Evaluation of Modern Music,"An exceedingly well researched and elegantly written text explaining the social and cultural impact of electronic music and especially synthesizer technology on musicians of all levels. This is a most important piece of work, and while written at an almost ""academic"" and scholarly level, is a book every modern musician will find valuable."
1,Not at all what I ordered,"The description for this item is ""4M glow in the dark stars assorted stars pack of 16"". In the picture it is a package with a circle full of stars. After you click on it, it is a completely different picture with a moon and several stars. When I recieved it I got a moon and 5 stars. And I ordered two of these so I paid more than $13 for something I could have paid $2 for."
4,Great and lasting glow in the dark stars,Bought this set to decorate up the room for my baby boy and I really love it. It was bright enough in the dark yet not too bright to make my boy sleepless.
4,Grandsons Love it,I bought these to take along for the boys (ages 2 & 4) on a recent camping trip. They loved them. At age 2 they should be very closely suppervised with these but he enjoyed them just as much as the 4 year old. They made a circle of the glow sticks around a big tree and thought it was great.
1,Maybe I use it wrong,I pasted it on my son's ceiling. The room is generally pretty bright but they just doesn't glow at all at night. :(
4,Good book for information on natural materials,"This book is helpful if you want to know how to use and care for natural materials in and oustside the home. There were some good photos featuring modern interiors but not very many photos relating to modern retro, as I had hoped for. I would recomend this book to anyone wanting ideas on using different types of natural materials for their home."
2,Not that Great,"I would have enjoyed this more if they had gone into greater detail on what the materials they used are, and how to achieve more natural finishes etc..."
4,World Machine,"Although ""Something About You"" will always hold a special place in my heart because I danced to it when it hit the scene in the 80s, the rest of this CD has a great mix of jazz and funk. Well worth checking out if you like a mix of music styles. I recommend this CD to any music lover. Good quality recording and CD.CA Luster"
4,Simply incredible!!!!,"Level 42 is simply incredible and the fact that they aren't more popular often baffles me. Yes they are big-- but with such incredible playing and songwriting they were on another level indeed (maybe even Level 42! ), when compared to their peers-- they should have been HUGE!If you want great, commercially accessible music, with great musicianship and production, World Machine is a must have.If you love music, World Machine is a must have.The double disc is great because it shows how incredibly talented the band is live and in the studio."
4,"Not their best, but still worth owning","""Late Again"" is not the most popular PPM album, nor does it contain much that has made it to a ""hits"" or retospective collection. It does, however, contain some wonderful material. ""Moments of Soft Persausion"" is absolutely beutiful. Take a few minutes and listen to the sample from the album listing. ""Rich Man Poor Man"" is, in my opinion, one of the best songs PPM ever recorded. With the refrain of ""A rich man eats when he wishes, a poor man whenever he can"", I expected it to show up on ""Songs of Conscience and Concern"". It didn't. That means, this is the only album which has it. It, alone, is worth the purchase price of the album."
5,Great recording!,CD in excellent shape and arrived very quickly. Good to have again a recording I enjoyed so much so long ago.
2,"Revisiting ""Late Again""","I recently listened to my cd of this after several years. With the perspective of hindsight, it seems like they are groping for a way to stay relevant as musical tastes change. 40 years later, the sound is simply disappointing. I remember getting the greatest hits album in high school and wondering why ""Too Much of Nothing"" was on it. It seemed so out of place. Now I understand.It is interesting to hear their version of ""Reason to Believe"" - a great piece of material. The two Paul Stookey tunes - ""Hymn"" and ""Love City"" are the best thing on the record. They sound true. While his solo version of Hymn on a later album was a little better, there is an introspection about this version that can't be matched.Thank goodness for ""Album 1700"". That brought them back around to their classic sound. And, although it is clearly a minority opinion, I really enjoyed ""Reunion"", certainly much more than ""Late Again"""
3,"Did not meet my hope, and expectations.","It does not do any better than the processor that it replaced. I have upgraded this old XP computer as about as much as I can upgrade it. Getting this processor was the last element in the puzzle. Off line, it is fine, just as the 1800 processor was, but on line, it functions about the same...slow. Understandable. It is an older computer, and an older processor. Even so, although it did not meet my hope, and expectations, it works."
4,A great way to relive Olympic memories,A great way to relive Olympic memories. It's hard to remember the stars of past Olympics unless you go back and review these tapes.
1,"Predictable, boring, flat",This book was awful. Her characters are too flat and unrealistic. Her dialogue is stilted and her plot is unbelievable. Her sucess and multitudes of positve reviews is baffling.
2,"Cliche, cliche, cliche.","While some confusingly bitter reviewers angrily state that the story is ""stolen"" from that horrid show Buffy, I'm afraid the story is Amelia's. It would seem that her talent peaked with her last book, ""Demon in my View"". Honestly, if you want to read more by this author, skip this book and continue on to her fourth one."
3,Shattered Mirror,"This book was an all right book. It confused me greatly. I liked Sarah, who was an excellent page-stealer, and Christopher's sister, Nissa, who seemed expertly created. However, Christopher and Nikolas both annoyed me. Christopher was too cocky, to I-Know-You'll-Love-Me. And Nikolas was an excellent villian for a while...until the author completely changed directions in making him a caring, loving Vampire. It drove me crazy, espeacially as Atwater-Rhodes made the witches more and more ""bad"". They seemed to become gradually worse than the vampires, while I had wanted it for once to be the other way around.Although I reccomend READING this book,I wouldn't BUY this book. It's a great addition to Atwater-Rhodes' collections..."
5,What did I think?,"It was a good book. It is by far better than the other two. I was pretty surprised at how much she grew. And I do have a message for Amelia, should she come across this - Don't listen to other people who try to set limits for you. Break past their boundaries and do what makes you happy. Whenever someone tries to set a limit for you, it should only inspire you even more. And when someone either passionately loves or passionately hates your books, it means that you have a very controversial, but very good book! And you have ""it"", the charisma that people like Stephen King, Justin Timberlake, and The Rock have. Don't ever listen to people who tell you that ""you can't."" They just aren't worth it.I also wonder about the people who put bad reviews on this book. Could it just be envy?"
3,Worst book I have ever read.,"The book is bad from begining to end. We all know Miss Amelia is a young writer, but has she ever heard of a thing called pronouns? Her writing frustrated me and got on my nerves. She keeps on writing ""Sarah...Nikolas.."" in every single sentence. Then, she combines to many things into a sentence in a really bad way. The story did not seem interesting to me at all. If you're an ignorant gothic kid you'll enjoy this book, but other than that you will hate it! It's an annoying book and she needs to add more detail to her writing. I never want to open this book ever again in my life!=_='"
2,well...,"This one was better than the other one I read from her (Demon...)... better, but not great. I picked up this one because a friend was completly crazy about her. The plot twist was great and seemed so original... and then i read the other one and my illusions were shattered. Just finding out that Demon came first is a dissapointment. I feel sorry for this poor author because all her life from now on she'll be reminded of these terrible works of fluff. Make way, much better writers are on their way."
5,Shattered Mirror,"This book was really good and I would suggest it to anyone who likes vampire books, romance novels, and/or action books. It's very interesting what Amelia portrays vampires as."
3,It's ok....,"The first two books In the Forests of the Night, and Demon in My View in my opionion were much better than this one. I was just about to put this book down when something happened to keep me reading. Didn't hold my attention because I can't remember what it was now :( I will go ahead and read the next one since i've come this far, but if you want a really good series on Vamps/Witches...don't read this one."
2,Two and a half stars,"I would if I could give it two and a half, but the book as I have noticed from other reviews, yes there are a lot of storylines taken from Buffy and other horror writers, which is what upsets me. I'm kind of offended that she hasn't yet written something, well original, I am hoping she makes an improvement sometimes in the future. Her writing is stronger, it's her creativity is what needs work. The whole Buffy thing just annoys me. It's too unoriginal for my say."
5,Thriller,If you love reading vampire books then you gotta read this one. This story line is so different that it keeps you locked in. It's different to read a story abiut vampires from a hunter's view.
2,Not really that good . . .,"While the plot seems interesting and the poetry is pretty good, The author's style is forced and rushed. MAybe if Miss Atwater-Rhodes wrote the book over in a couple of years, I'd give it a try."
3,Improvement,I was impressed with her effort in this book. It was much better then her last which I was disappointed with. Though she lacked some elements like character build and her ending was exactly like Demon in My View so I give it three stars.
4,Slow beginning --- good ending,"Being that i am a big fan of Amelia, i really liked this book. The book began kind of slow... but it was worth it.. by the middle i got hooked.. the story line was pretty cool.. and NOTHING LIKE BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER... theres more to it.. i du not regret buying this book... it was really cool"
3,"Not too shabby, but not great","Yes, Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is a talented writer, but somehow I think her writing lacks personality. Also, as another reviewer said, she lacks originality. I'd recommend this to younger readers looking for a taste of the occult. If you're looking for romance, you're not going to find it here. Although SHATTERED MIRROR *does* have more romance than Atwater-Rhodes's two previous novels, it's nothing spectacular. For example, she needs more description in kissing and falling in love and such. But then again she's just a kid, so she hasn't learned everything there is to know about writing yet. It's worth the read at any rate, even if you only read it once."
4,remarkable but a little bit disappointing,"This book was I think, a little bit of a let down. I wanted to see some of the old charactors we all cared about. (Risika, Aubrey, Jessica, Fala, Ather, Jagar) The only familiar charactors were Dominique and Caryn. You heard about Nikolas being so strong and everything, but if he was, why didn't we hear about him in previous books??? I didn't like the newer charactors as much as the old ones. One good thing about the book was its length. It was longer then the previous ones. It was also written better too. Overall this book is a good one, except I prefered Demon in My View and In the forests of the night."
4,Breathless...,"That is how the end of this book left me. All of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's books affect you in different ways. The stories are the same, but different. I have enjoyed them all, and my respect and admiration for this girl grows with each of her books. I like each one better than the one before it."
4,Best Yet,"So far this is the novel i can tell she had taken some time to write. It was great until the conclusion where she used the same ending as Demon only in different words.Her writing had progressed extremely well in this novel and I praise her for it. She took her time until the ending where she rushed.Though I found Sarah to be annoying with her overly confident persona. And it resembles Buffy the Vampire Slayer too much.Those looking for an average written book, this is a recommended pick."
4,Interesting plot,this novel was not at all amelia's best but it was a very interesting novel with a mixture of love and hatred among peers and creatures! she didn't quite have that same dark haunting style in this novel and that is what i like best about her writing so i was a little disappointed but it was a pretty delicious novel to read. If you are into romance and breaking the rules
5,Excellent Horror,"This book was a short but sweet book, filled with vampires, action, and a little bit of romance to top it of."
3,Exciting with unexpected ending.,"What really stuck with me as a message in the book is that it's hard not to judge people and that there are two sides to most people. Sometimes it's easier to think in terms of black and white with the evil villian and the hero. Here the villian turns out to have a sensitive side?It's a really interesting plot, the way you can't tell who's evil or not. It's a good idea but the ending stumped and kind of upset me.It's an interesting book but the ending largely upset and creeped me out so I only gave it 3 stars."
5,good vampire book,"I thought this book was excellent. Geared toward teens, it expresses some of the emotions they feel many days. Sara, the main character, mirrors how some of us feel, confused. I liked the vampires, especially Christoper. The book flows smoothly, and is easy to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read 'The Last Vampire' series by Christopher Pike or just likes vampires."
5,# 3,"i just finished Shattered Mirror. Let me just say WOW! it was awesome, Sarah was one of the best characters ever developed. Sarah and Christopher seems so cute together. it shows a gentleness abt the vampires u dont see in the other books. saying that some choose not to kill. u also learn abt the other lines, something i'm VERY happy to know now. it bothered me that u didnt know a lot abt the vampire lines other than Silver and a little bit of Mira. Christopher, Nissa, Aleksander, and Sarah are awesome characters i hope will show up in other books. Amelia is my Fav. author. and i cant wait for her next book. Aubrey still rocks and we hope for a return."
1,Disappointed,"I have to say I am very disappointed in this writer. After reading her last two books I expected her to improve in her writing. The ending didn't really catch my eye. It seemed weak, maybe a little weaker then Demon In My View's.I think she needs to go into more depth. There's just not enough.I do wish her luck and hope for a change. Something different I hope. It be nice if she could go outside of witches and vampires. It would be a change, variety is more."
5,best book on car crime,"Considering not big choice that we have today in books about car crimes, I purchased this book and I'm very glad. It's an excellent quality book (as all the books of Willan Publishing) and contains all the detailed account on this specific type of crime. I even found the seperate chapter about theft from car which is not considered under ""car crimes"" in my country, we have it separately. This book is useful for criminal lawyers(like me) and for criminologists because the book gives information interesting for any of the people mentioned above."
5,great drill,"great drill at a great price,has a lot of torque and high speed. drives screws real fast also.black and decker is awesome"
1,I returned it. It burnt out after 1 use.,"It was way too fast. I may have tighten something too much to get it to loosen. Overall, good."
5,Bought several copies for around the house,"In order to have the same caller id and dialing functions, without learning new commands for different models of telephone, we bought a total of three Sony SPP-ID975 telephones, to put in the home office, in the living room, and in the family room."
1,Terrible Phone,When I purchased this phone I thought a Sony was a good product and the phone wasn't a cheapy. However the phone CONSTANTLY channel searches/found channel which breaks up your conversation and you can't hear. Sony said when this happens to move closer to the base but you could be standing 1 foot away and it does it. Whats the purpose of having a cordless phone if you can't leave the base?? Called Sony CS Support and because it was no longer under warranty they gave me some troubleshooting to try. One of them was to replace the battery which was done and didn't help. I will never purchase another Sony product. I don't believe you get what you pay for with Sony. Do not recommend this phone at all. I know 3 people that have this phone and the same thing happens to them also.
2,"Great features, terrible battery life","This phone, when it works, is wonderful. Caller ID, nice backlit display, excellent sound quality. But the batteries only last a few days before requiring a recharge, and this is with very light use, less than one hour per day.This is my second Sony cordless phone, and the second to have poor battery life. I doubt I'll buy another."
2,miscellaneous ramblings,"Ergonomics and appearance are much improved over some other Sony 900 mhz phones. The lighted LCD in the handset and base unit are great. Overall functionality is excellent.Speakerphone is good and the layout of the base unit is intuitive, attractive, and simple.Sound quality was a big disappointment. There was crackling on the handset and the volume seemed to oscillate on its own. I exchanged the phone and the sound of the replacement was no better. I moved both phones to different locations and it did not seem to matter. I then exchanged the phone for the Sony SPP-SS966, which is Digital Spread Spectrum and has much better sound quality but is not as attractive or as ergonomically correct. It boils down to a choice of form or function - I chose function."
2,visual basic,not for me way over the basics win 32 api is a dauting subject not the books fault most likey mine
2,Not that good as others have rated here,"Because of the good ratings here I bought that book since I thought that Dan Appleman's book was too difficult. To my mind Jason Bock's book is not so good since it is not suitable for absolute Win32-API beginners. He starts with the exceptions, critical things and so on. Often he writes, that something will be explained in another chapter. This is a bad design of a tutorial. He has some good tips and tricks in that book, but if one is a beginner with Win32-API he must read too many things a few times until he understands them. Dan Appleman's book seems to be a little better for beginners."
4,Excellent book to get you started actually doing it.,"While Appleman's book continues to be the definitive =reference= book. This book offers some real world examples of how to use the Win32 API to not only do things that you can't do with VB intrinsic commands and controls, but also to subtantially boost the performance of things you could do with regular VB. Specific examples are worked through and type conversions are explained within this context.I'd recommend it to anyone that's thinking the API might have something more to offer than current directory information (they'd be right).I wouldn't use every example in real life, but there are plenty I would use, and all are excellent examples of what can be done.DISCLAIMER: I was a technical reviewer on this book, and, as such, am somewhat tied to Wrox and the quality of the end product. Rest assured, however, that I don't get any perks from this review, and the opinion is mine and mine alone.Rob Vieira, MCSD, MCT"
5,Excellent Book for API Beginners!,"Personally I thought this book was great for progammers just starting out with the API or Applications Programmers Interface. The examples are well laid out and the code is mostly bug free. Yes this book does not have the depth of some other earlier mentioned books, however it is important to realize that this is a tutorial. Because this book claims to be a tutorial it should be rated on how well it teaches the subject. Personally I think the author did a great job and I learned a significant amount from this book."
4,Pure Entertainment from the Golden Age of Hip-Hop,"The Pharcyde has changed quite a bit over the years, they have become a lot more polished and smooth, but this is still my favorite, thoughHumboldt Beginningsis a close second. The high pitched juvenile humor manages to do the trick even after repeated listenings. The last track is a classic old school anthem well worth the purchase price alone. Highly recommended to anyone, especially if you are into West Coast or early 90's hip hop."
5,Freestyle geniuses...,"Passin'me by 4 Otha Fish are the two best songs...yeah, what guy couldn't admit to feeling that way at some point in his life? This album is so dope, definitely one of the best hip-hop albums in the last few years. Their style is so crazy, and their freestylin' is unbelievable."
5,Classic,"Surprising to see young hiphop heads picking up this album. Anybody will tell you this is a classic album and it was ahead of its time. It sound fresh even though it is almost a decade old, and my oldass cd (with scratches) that I bought back when it was released still gets played. Check out their second release, more commercial but good."
5,"Kickin beats, explosive lyrics","I didn't think it was possible to stuff so many lyrics into one album, but The Pharcyde proved me wrong. They aren't just lyrics you listen to though, these lyrics entertain you from start to finish. And the beats, well to sum them up I'll use the words fun, entertaining (just like the lyrics), and classic, I mean come on you just got to love the ""Passing me by"" the song that was so overly sampled by Joe & Mystikal in their ""Stutter remix"", and you can't forget about other classics like ""Soul Flower remix"" and ""Pack the pipe"". The whole album is good, and after listening to this it's hard not to be in a good mood."
5,You don't have this cd? Are you crazy? Buy it now punk!!,"The Pharcyde's 1993 release, Bizarre Ride to the Pharcyde, is the definition of the early 90's hip hop, mixing the Native Tongue sound with a distinct west Coast attitude. this cd doesn't get old, it's as good in 1999 as it was the day it was released. Even the skits are funny. Actually, even if the rest of the cd sucked, this release would be a classic based solely on the greatest, most humble, hip hop song ever, Passin' me by. If you can't relate to what the guys are saying, you either haven't lived or you're in denial. But the whole cd is dope, from beginning to end, each song a different manifestation of the Pharcyde's individual and collective unique personalities. You've never heard a cd like this before,but I guarentee if you love hip hop or at least have an open mind to other kinds of music like hip hop, you'll agree that this cd is a classic. So buy it now, and take the bizarre ride."
2,For Beginners...,"This book is an all-around puppy manual for the beginner. There were few novel ideas and the majority of these ideas seemed ""gimmicky"" by Bash applying his own monikers to techniques. Graphic illustrations (drawings) were remarkably poor. An experienced dog owner may find more use in one of the other dozens of books on dog training."
5,DogSpeak,This is a great book. I borrowed it from the public library and it was so helpful I wanted my own copy. It came in excellent condition.
3,Good General Info,"This book will help you understand why your dog is misbehaving, but it doesn't reallt provide enough info to help you correct the behavior."
4,Murders review,"Murders on Elderberry Road, A Queen Bee Mystery is an easy book to read with interesting charachers and situations. I believe that many readers will enjoy the ladies of the Queen Bee Quilters."
1,retarded saddle blanket seat covers,"Finally got the new seat covers and they didn't fit!! Doubled checked the order, all numbers and the picture is correct. Truck info is correct and seat covers are wrong!! It is a totally retarded design!! They send you one sheet of generic instructions that don't apply to these seats and show no seatbelts at all. There is no way to put the covers on over the attached seatbelts even though the ordering picture shows them doing that. Even the fit around the console between seats not comprehensible (and cheap plastic material). The design and instructions for these are worse than bad. Do not buy -they will not work!"
4,One of the best sources on Bonny & Read,"I bought *THE PIRATE TRIAL OF ANNE BONNY & MARY READ* in order to write a paper about these women for my Western Civ class. Out of the four books I read about pirates, *THIS* book provided me much more information on these women, by far. It's not large, so it's very easy to read - and provides straightforward, well researched facts in a no nonsense writing style. I found information in this book that I'd never read anywhere else, and the complete transcript of their trial was extremely helpful to me, because it saved me the time and trouble of ordering a copy. Ms. Tamara Eastman states at the end of this book that she is coming out with another book on Anne Bonny and Mary Read very soon. I am anxiously awaiting the next book, because I really enjoyed *THIS* one.Stephanie C. Cambridge, Massachusetts"
4,Nice job,I've seen a lot of trashy myths when reading about these girl pirates but I really liked -The pirate trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read- The whole book is presented in an easy to read style and the authors have done a great job of telling these two ladies story in such a way that it is very well understood by the reader. Another thing I like about this book is that I didn't have to wade through a bunch of -B.S.- stories like you do in a lot of other books about lady pirates. Instead of telling the same stories over again these authors have provided very good facts about them that they've found in their research. The complete trial notes are an added bonus to an already very good book. I recommend this book.
2,Definitely NOT what I expected,Not certain what I thought I was getting but there is no music on these DVDs. Totally a documentary that isn't even authorized.
1,Crap - $20-something bucks & 2+ hrs of my life I will not get back,"Don't bother! I am a huge Bon Jovi fan and this was absolute crap! I should have read the fine print before purchasing, as I did not realize that this was unauthorized DVD about the band. Crap, crap, crap. Very disappointed."
1,Waste of Money IMO,This is simply an unauthorized documentary x2.If you like that kind of thing I guess its ok but theres no Bon Jovi authorized material included at all.IMO a total RIP!
1,What a rip off!,"Very disappointed. Someone appointed themselves to be an ""insider""! This is old information and does not even have any music on it and is not authorized by Bon Jovi. Do not waste your money. Not as advertised!"
2,"Another Theory about ""The Ending"" to ""P""","So many have been disappointed with the unresolved ending to ""P"" that I think it can't be an accident. I would be willing to bet Grafton had her usual final chapter, tieing up all the loose ends with her traditional book-ending ""report"" -- and that the publisher/editor said ""let's try an experiment and drop it and maybe resolve it all at the start of the next book"".Sort of like Janet Evanovich ended one book with our leading lady in bed with one of two lovers and we had to wait til the next book to find out who.If it were an experiment, I hated it. And ""Q"" better straighten it out !!"
2,P is for Peril,"I'm like the other reviewers. I'm the first in line to grab up Grafton's new book as soon as it hits the streets. With ""P is for Peril"" something strange is going on. Kinsey does feel like Kinsey anymore. Is Sue Grafton tired of her main character? This could happen. The book almost feels like it was written by someone else using Sue's name. Does this happen in publishing world? I will read the next book but I'll get it from the library."
3,P is for Perplexed,"I feel that the ending left too many questions unanswered. Loose ends everywhere. . .where is Miriah? Where are the jewels? Guess I've read too many novels that lay it out and don't leave many unanswered questions, or not obvious ones. It's like the book was supposed to be 299 pages, so that's where the story ended."
2,Who wrote this book?,"I have read ALL of Sue Grafton's alphabet series books. This one was by far the most tedious, uninspiring and frustrating! There was no consistency in the storylines and the ending, well, what WAS the ending? It was a relatively long book for Grafton and the ending should have been wrapped up a little more neatly. I love the Kinsey character, yet she seemed to be different in this book -- almost another personality. I'm wondering if Grafton really wrote this book? It certainly didn't seem like her writing at all. I'm being generous giving this book 2 stars."
2,"If it works, don't change it","The ending was totally not a Kinsey ending. Also more boring details and less of Kinsey's antics made this Grafton work under her standards. Grafton's writing skills has improved but her content lacks character and enthusiasm. The book is a disappointment but I haven't given up on Grafton yet. Hey Sue, if it works, don't change it."
4,P is for Perfect,"This is one of the better ""alphabet series"" one's and to think she still has ten more to do before it is over. ""P"" is action filled, keeps going until the ending. I personally could have done without the extra story line of her would be boyfriend but hey. The ending is very good and according to other reviews they don't get it (suggestion--read it again) it is clearly spelled out for you and it is quite obvious. Anyway this was a fun read and highly recommend it, and I hope her future books are as good as this one."
2,P is for PTTTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHH,"Have read all the series and really enjoyed them, but this one leaves me cold. Characters lack the usual full development, and the ending is the worst in the series."
2,A far cry from her usual level of entertainment...,"If this is what Otto Penzsler feels is ""non-stop action,"" I'm going to have to pay less attention to his reviews. I agree with Amazon's review, which refers to the ""plodding pace."" I could barely finish this book, and wouldn't have if it weren't Sue Grafton. The plot was so thin I figured it out immediately, and it was so easy to see through Mariah that I couldn't believe Grafton had the nerve to make it so obvious. I have greatly enjoyed all the books in the series up until now, but in my opinion, this is by far the worst. Very difficult to care about any of the colorless characters, and I found it hard to like even Kinsey in this book. If this were Grafton's first novel in the series it would go nowhere. Sorry, Sue!"
3,Pretty good until the ending which didn't make sense,"Kinsey Milhorne is back trying to find Dr. Purcell when she is hired by Dr. Purcell's ex-wife, Fiona. Kinsey investigates current wife, ex wife, business relationship of Dr. Purcell. The story has another side story re: a potential new relationship for Kinsey that has a surprise end but has nothing to do with her current case. Enjoyed the story until the whodunit was exposed and didn't really see the motive."
3,Grafton Comes Through,"I've been disenchanted with the last batch of Grafton's novels, but yea! this one was pretty good. To those of you who thought the ending was abrupt and perplexing, go back and re-read the last chapter. The answers are there. And you'll also understand why the book is called P is for Peril."
1,P was not up to Par,"Sue Grafton is one of my favorite authors, but I wish I had skipped this one! I agree with the other readers about the ending. It seemed very vague to me, too."
3,Where's our Kinsey?,"This book certainly does not exhibit Sue Grafton's superb writing style in which the previous Kinsey Millhone mysteries have grabbed me from Page 1. The plot was interesting enough, though not nearly as intriguing as the sub-plot involving Mariah and the Hevener boys. However, I felt like knocking Kinsey on the head - ""Hello, is anyone in there; why don't you check her credentials!!"". Perhaps Ms. Grafton was rushed to publish the next in the series. As much as I love the continuing saga of Kinsey, I'd much rather wait for a really good storyline. Still, the book was enjoyable and worth the effort of reading."
3,OK...whodunnit and why?,"I agree with other reviewers that this book seems to be missing a final chapter. I found myself reading back over sections of the book, searching for clues since there are too many unanswered questions. And what was the point of setting this story back in the 80's rather than current times? I'd love a chance to talk to Sue Grafton about this book."
3,Not At All Impressive,"Having waited quite a while for this book to be published, I sat down with much anticipation to read it. Unfortunately, like most things greatly anticipated, it didn't quite live up to expectations. While entertaining and somewhat familiar in tone, it was also not as well written as I have come to expect from Ms. Grafton. My biggest problem is with a ending that I saw coming a mile off. While not necessarily disturbing in and of itself, combined wtih the fact that the main characters seemed to be lacking depth and the secondary plot was MUCH more interestng than the primary, I finished the book without satisfaction and no hurry to get to the ending as is usual with Ms. Grafton's previous work. All in all, an uninspired outing for Kinsey Millhone."
3,Publisher on drugs?,"I read and enjoyed this book as I have all in the series, however, the Kindle price is a joke, right?"
1,"""P"" is for Pointless","What was that? I've enjoyed Sue Grafton's A through O books over the past year, but this was sub-par. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. The book just (mercifully) . . . ended."
2,"""P"" is for Predictable""","Perhaps by Z, Ms. Grafton will give her readers a quality story. I'm forever hopeful (even after 15 mediocre attempts) because I think her heroine, Kinsey Milhone, deserves better. Certainly, we readers do. If you want a quick summer read while you're at the beach that won't take too much attention away from the ""sights,"" then this is perfect. If, on the other hand, you'd like to be challenged by a good plot or moved by deep thoughts and emotions, may I suggest another author. Maybe ""Q"" should be for ""Quit""."
3,So-So,"First, I did not like the ending at all!!!Second, two stories in one...Tommy was too predictable!!!This was okay...maybe ""Q"" will be better...lets hope!!!"
4,Unexpected ending!,"Private Investigator Kinsey Millhone is hired by an ex-wife to investigate the disappearance of her former husband. The investigation into this disappearance pits past and current wives against one another, as well as the extended families involved. Dow Purcell, the missing man, has no known enemies and was generally well liked ,particularly by those at his office where he oversaw a very nice nursing care home. While this mystery begins the story, the most interesting part of the novel involves the two brothers Kinsey meets when she decides to rent office space from them in a nearby location. Who are these brothers? Where are they from? Who is investigating them? These questions form the fast paced second mystery in this Kinsey Millhone story. This is a great diversion novel, reads quickly and holds your attention easily. The ending is unexpected!!"
2,Where is Sue Grafton?,"I was incredibly disappointed in this book. The writing style was not what I was used to in previous books. Gone was the light touch. Instead, the dialog seemed like something out of a grade B romance novel. The usually flowing and descriptive prose was flat and awkward. The humor that is so important to the character of Kinsey was nowhere to be felt. The only way I could finish the book was to pretend that I was reading a novel written by someone else with a character similar to Kinsey. Even then it was hard going. This book made me wonder if,in fact, Sue Grafton wasn't too busy to write it herself and just provided the outline of the plot and characters to someone much younger and less gifted to fill in the details. My advise to a new reader of Sue Grafton is to read all the other books of hers and forget this one exists. You'll love her that way."
1,P is for Peril on Kindle,"This quite interesting book in Grafton's generally excellent series was fine until I got to the end of the kindle version. The ending is missing! Kinsey is left in peril, and there's no wrap-up as usual for the series."
2,Long Rambling Read With Fizzled Out Ending,"I've to date read every book in the series (except ""I"" and ""Q"" which I'll read soon). Of these reads, this one is the most uninteresting book I've encountered. It's as if the author tired of the subject and decided that 350 pages was enough and... oh, well. At least the characterization of Kinsey is still intact. I'm sorry - I don't wish to write a negative review but the weak ending (and the lack of the ""Respectfully Submitted"" report) is what ruined the read for me."
1,It was the first I read but...,"This was the first Sue Grafton book read so I went in with an open mind. The writing is drawn out but the mystery is even worse, it seemed all over with nothing really tieing together. I kept waiting for some expose or conclusion. Then the 2 brothers seemed totally pointless. It seemed like they'd tie to the other crime.Maybe it's just because this was my first novel, I got annoyed when half through I realized it was set in 1986. Odd since it was written/published in 2001 and until then all references were as if the story was taking place today. That's her choice I just wish the time frame was specified at the beginning."
2,P is for DisaPpointment !,"My title makes as much sense as her ending! Although I have always enjoyed the Grafton ABC series, this was a huge disappointment! The ending is...........well, not there! And, although I do prefer to ""figure it out on my own"", I seek that finality of conclusion that is lacking in this book. I truly believe that the publisher/printer has ommitted the final chapter!"
4,Comparatively bland....,"This is the first Sue Grafton novel that I have read. I was skeptical at first, but I grew to care not for Kinsey Millhone, but for many of the other characters in the book. Even the eventual murderer had some wonderful traits. The plot is well conceived, interesting and well-played out. It held my attention, but it did not make me want to run out and buy another Grafton novel. I read Koontz's ""From the Corner of His Eye"" previous to ""P"", and the Koontz book is much more compelling. In conclusion, read this book, but borrow it from the library instead of buying it!"
5,Couldn't put it down.,"I am surprised by some of the less than positive reviews of ""P is for Peril"". I was thrilled to get back in touch with Kinsey and couldn't put the book down. Two mysteries going on at once - one interesting and one making me a nervous break for Kinsey's safety. A surprise your ""stomach drops"" ending. Another winner in my book."
2,Disappointing,"I love every other book about the alphabet series, but this book disappointed me. In fact, the last several books (say, from ""L"" on) have seemed too short and underdeveloped compared with earlier books. Like many other readers, I thought a lot had been left out. I figured out who did it and why as soon as she described these characters, and I think it would have been interesting if she had developed the lesbian relationship instead of alluding to it on the last page. A lot of other characters appeared and then disappeared, such as Dow's daughter Blanche. Why did Kinsey never consult the psychic? Why did she even interview Blanche? Why did Sue Grafton even write about it? Very weird, and I have to agree that this book seemed rushed and ""cranked out."" Sue Grafton is very talented, and I hope she gets back on track, instead of simply describing peoples' appearance and home decor, as she seemed to do this time around."
3,Perilousless,"Kinsey is still on target as the well woven individulist, who follows her own complex cloth. But, the story dropped a major stitch. - The peril was not due to Kinsey's mis-selection of a case for detecting, but the ordinary consequence of seeking a new office and the subsequent knowledge this action brings. After debating her options with Henry, her beloved landlord, Kinsey leaves her decision in doubt. So unknowningly, Henry puts himself into the ""peril"" and it is along this course that the chosing of peril SHOULD have been given more life and scare for both he and Kinsey. Additionally, a bit more NEW information of Kinsey's past/future is due all of her devoted fans. Grafton is too good to have pressed this jacket so shiney and thin. Maybe her stated decision to complete the alphabet in 18-month stints, rather than annually, is a decison well made.I await Q is for Quarry, because every at bat did not produce a home run, even for Sammy Sousa. (SMILE!)"
2,P is for Pain,"No one is a bigger Sue Grafton fan than I; but this book disappoints. The characters are boring and the book is so cluttered with descriptions of every house, street, the weather, the ocean, etc. It took Grafton nearly two years to bring this book to the market and then she forgot to write an ending. This book will be donated to my local library, (along with a lot of others, I'm sure); so go to the library or wait for the paperback."
3,Not up to Jack PAAR,"Well, I thought it would make for an excellent start to the Summer reading list. But I was sadly mistaken. Unfortunately, Ms. Grafton left us like the proverbial bride at the altar with her finish to this novel. While it could keep your attention for the most part, it lacked full credibility in all of the sub-plots.Despite the results, including leaving the reader decide what happens to whomever, I will still avidly await Q Is for ------, whatever the q is."
2,P is for Paltry,"I feel better now that I have read a few of these reader's reviews. I finished the book and I'm looking for more, saying to myself, ""That can't be the end."" So I decide I must have read the last few pages too quickly and reread them. ""Sorry, Ms Grafton, this book needs a new ending. You forgot to give the killer a motive."" I will give Ms. Grafton credit on doing her homework about medical fraud and billing for Medicare. I am a medical doctor and bill Medicare for procedures. It is as confusing as she depicts it. I have read all of the books in this series--great books to bring to the beach --light and fun--so I will hope the next book will improve."
2,Where have I read this before?,"I know that I have read this plot and a lot of the details before. It bugged me the whole time I was reading it, but where? Considering the cost of a new hardbound book, I'd like a NEW plot. The first half thr dullest thing that Grafton has written. It improved, but over all I would say that it was a waste of money."
2,The ending [is bad],"I got to the last page of this book and expected more. The book was pretty good, but the ending wasn't what I was looking for and definitely not so soon. What happened to the last few pages?I have a signed copy and I thought that maybe for it being signed it was abridged or something. I spent 2 days reading it and then getting to the ending like that. If any more of her books end like this, I won't be fan much longer.I just hated spending hours reading this book and then it ending so abruptly."
2,The true mystery in Peril is what happened to the ending?,"P is for Peril started out good but slowed to a grinding halt. The sub-plot with the brothers really could have developed into a good story but it was not allowed to. Also as many others have stated, what happened to the ending? Read the last chapter twice and I am still not sure ""who done it"". Which could be intriguing but instead causes frustration for the reader. The style of writing is different in this book too. Less humor and descriptive narrative than in previous books. It would appear unfair to not recommend this book to longtime Grafton fans. However for newcomers start at the beginning with A is for Alibi, you wont be disappointed."
3,Get Kinsey into the 21st Century!,"As a devoted Grafton fan, I was somewhat disappointedby ""P"". In addition to the dry humor one expects (whichwas missing), one usually learns something about a new topic(which was missing).The characters seem to bounce back and forth which necessitatedre-reading, to find out who was who. Other than the sub-plotinvolving the brothers and Henry uncharacteristically willingto bop one, this was not one of Sue's best.Will I read the rest of the 'alphabet'? No question, as I havefaith in Sue and have had too much past enjoyment. Maybe she'lleventually get a cell phone and, who knows, bop Henry!"
3,P Is for Peril,"Though not Grafton's usual style, I can only hope that Q comes quickly and wraps up P. P needs an ending, it was great until the last chapter."
1,THIS JUST IN: KINSEY MILLHONE LOSES HER VOICE!,"I just read L through P in one week. L through O were well told, light, funny, witty and worth the dollars I paid for each of them at the used book store. But P is for Peril marks the first book by Grafton at her new publisher. Grafton evidently forgot to cart along her former editor, who was largely responsible for Kinsey's quirky voice and character.In P is for Peril, Kinsey has lost her voice completely. Grafton has drafted someone new to fill the vast void the last editor filled so well. The voice is now serious, stilted and silly at best.The old Milhone is sorely missed, having died in O. O is for Oh, my, goodness, please bring back Kinsey!P is for Presposterous!Sue evidently has followed the old Lawrence Sanders suit (he had some flunky named Vincent write drivel in Sanders' name) and left the writing to some underling whose voice in no way mirrors Grafton's witty, light and clever one.Goodbye, Sue. You lost a once-dedicated fan...."
3,Terrible ending,"I just finished P is for Peril. It was entertaining (but I found myself skipping over unecessary details). I felt much more could have been made of the sub plot (the brothers). It really didn't add much to the story. My biggest complaint is the ending, if one can call it that. Yes, we know (spoiler) ....but are never told why. All the complicated goings on at the nursing home, characters that seemed guilty, just dissolved. I was left extremely dissappointed!"
3,P is for Peril,"I think this is one of my least favorite Kinsey books. I dont know if it was the subject, retirement homes, or the characters but I was bored. I did however like the sub story with the two brothers. Too bad there couldnt have been more of that. Still looking forward to when the next book comes. Kinsey forever!"
2,Perturbed!,"Am a Sue Grafton fan, but this one left me cold. Too many sub-plots that never really came together and the final chapter didn't even pull it together; left me with too many unanswered questions. In fact I wonder if possibly the publisher left out the final chapter. Grafton usually does a great job of tying up all the loose ends into a tidy conclusion. Not so this time!"
3,Not the Strongest Entry in the Series,"What Grafton seems to have here is enough material for two Kinsey short stories, with some walk-ons from her supporting cast. Neither of the two cases is particularly engaging, and Kinsey herself doesn't seem to learn or grow this time out, and we don't really learn anything about her that we don't already know.Grafton can still outwrite most of the detective writers around with one hand behind her back, but this outing is definitely a bit shorter on spark than the usual."
1,Very Disappointing,"This was a very disappointing novel from Sue Grafton. In addition to being very wordy (is she paid by the page?), Kinsey Milhone is quite dislikable. She finds fault with nearly everyone she encounters, especially the very young and those responsible for them. Were this Sue Grafton's first in the Kinsey Milhone series, it might never have been published."
1,Graduate Thesis of the James T. Kirk School of Reading....,"While the book itself was quite good, I could not get past the awful reading by Judy Kaye. This was by far the worst audiobook I've ever listened to. I'm sorry I bought it. Ms. Kaye reads with ridiculous pauses that brought me back to the overdone acting of William Shatner in the original Star Treks. I do not recommend this Audiobook. Read it on hardcopy."
3,Not her best,"I just finished reading this book and it was good but not how she usually writes. I kept forgetting I was reading a Kinsey book. It was not like her others, which I have read, at all. In a way it was kind of boring. And the ending was weird. I have no idea who the killer was. She did not say. I will look forward & buy her next book but this one just does not rank up there with the others. I totally agree with the first few reviews."
2,Least Favorite of the Series,"Having read all the books in the series, I must say this is my least favorite. I read it on my iPad and when I got to the end of the story (or lack thereof) I thought it was a technical glitch. After a bit of googling, it turns out there is no conclusion, no final summary from Kinsey, etc. The reader was left to figure it out for themselves (which was not difficult).Interesting literary technique, but had no value add in this case."
1,My 1st and probably last Grafton read,"I listened to this story on unabridged audio and the ending was so lacking, I honestly looked to see if there was a tape I had yet to listen to.The author goes into such extreme details as to tell the reader that the character used the restroom, (like I care, like it has any bearing at all on the story), but then ends the story abruptly, without details or any real explanation at all.Thank goodness, it was only $1 at the used book store (I can see why). Give me Nevada Barr or Elizabeth Peters any day over Grafton."
3,Is a chapter missing?,"I'm a big Kinsey Millhone fan and, as expected, really enjoyed the P issue. But only untill I got to the very last sentence; is a chapter missing? Up to O, Sue Grafton has ended her Kinsey mysteries with an epilogue, concluding with the words: ""respectfully submitted, Kinsey Millhone"". In the paperback edition, there is no such conclusion and I must admit I still don't know who the killer is. I figured maybe it was an author's trick, like a weird teaser. I hope it is and that she will give us some clue in Q."
2,read at your own peril,"Well, as far as books go this was not really that bad of a read. It just didn't grab me and not let go as most of Grafton's works have. As usual I very much enjoyed the Kinsey Millhone character. In fact I wish she were a real person so I might meet her some day. But the overall plot and especially the ending just didn't do it for me. The first few pages held some promise. Missing doctor; ex wife hires kinsey; young current wife seems indifferent; teenage daughter is out of control...so what else is new? You get the idea. Kind of intresting, but it just bogs down and just seems too contrived for a SG alphabet mystery tome. Again, I must remind you to keep this less than flattering review in perspective. Because Sue has done better, P is for poor."
2,P is for Please do an Epilogue,"Ms. Grafton's use of epilogues to resolve issues is a trademark that is sorely missed in this book. When I finished the book, I was left unfulfilled. The two main plots never intersect (there are actually several other subplots regarding the relationship between Dow and his family members). I was left with numerous questions such as Dow's relationship with his employers and their relationship with crime, and Krystal's daughter and her relationship with Dow and his money. While I can guess at most of the main points, I would appreciate not having to guess. Please tell Ms. Grafton to go back to epilogues. In fact, I would love to have one posted to her website even now.I also found Kinsey's relationship with Dow's first wife totally unrealistic when Kinsey was hired by Dow's second wife.Like others, I enjoy Ms. Grafton's style and wit. But this is surely her worst of the alphabet series."
4,First Grafton,"I was recently in a Borders books when Ms. Grafton was speaking and picked up her book to commemorate the event. My mother read the book first and then forced me to read it (which is only fair since I forced her to read Janet Evanovich's series).Kinsey's capers in this newest Grafton are light and entertaining. It's not a novel that's going tax your brain or cause you to pull out the notecards to keep things straight but it will keep you guessing. Grafton is good reading for those lazy rainy days or for times when you want to unwind. Funny, humorous, and entertaining.Kinsey's hot on the trail of a missing doctor hired by his ex wife no less. The old harridan is making Kinsey regret her hasty acceptance of the hefty money but that's not the only complication Ms. Milhone is going to have to face before she can take this one off the books. Grafton will keep you guessing. Don't be surprised if you like the killer more than the client."
4,Aren't you being a bit hard on Ms. Grafton?,"I agree with most of the critisms others have posted about P is for Peril(the ending is vague, I'm not sure of the killer's motives,the book is padded with endless desciptions of rooms, and Kinsey seemed to discover clues as if she were pyshic) However, this book is not as bad as they would have you believe. The subplot with the Hevenger brothers is the more exiting and menacing part of the book. Fiona is a great character. (She should have been in it more) I laughed out loud when Kinsey was hiding under the desk in the nursing home. While I agree it is not the best in the series, I will still be buying Ms. Grafton's next novel in hardcover. Respectfully Submitted Don"
2,Entertaining to Awful,"In the beginning, I thought this was the best novel that Sue Grafton had ever written. There was a great plot, numerous twist and turns and just enjoyable reading. Then the end of the book came and what a disappointment. It was confusing and left you feeling that you had just wasted your time reading the book."
3,An unfinished work?,"While Sue Grafton's writing style sparkles, as usual, with wit and vivid description, I couldn't help but think that the author should have kept on writing until she actually finished the book. The book contains a plot and a major subplot, and neither one is brought to a satisfactory resolution. Questions remain unanswered, loose ends are not entirely tied up. In fact it occured to me, some time after I read the final page, that heroine Kinsey Millhone had not actually told us the identity of the killer or the motive! Perhaps Grafton is being avant-garde; like many of her other fans, though, I would have appreciated a closing note ""Respectfully submitted."""
2,P is for Poor,"I am a devoted fan of the series but this one is either not completed (no ""respectfully submitted"" synopsis at the end) and for most of the book, it seem that Sue Grafton is still trying to figure out what the story will be about - much less how it will end. Very unsatisfying and NO character growth for Kinsey Millhone. No correlation between the title and the plot that I can see. Yeah she eats at Rosie's, skips the gym and eats junky sandwiches but almost as a gratuitous bone thrown to the reader. My advice is to borrow it, check it out of your library or wait until it's in paperback. It's not worth the hardback price.Sue Grafton should be allowed one dud and this one is definitely it!"
4,Still entertaining,"I disagree with the person who says ""perhaps Grafton was hoping readers would take an interest in the aged"". Why not? Is good reading only good if it's about the young? I, personally, cannot discriminate based on age and found that this latest Grafton mystery was very entertaining. In fact, her description of the residents of Pacific Meadows was both stirring and sweet - especially when I think of my own aging parents. On the reverse, she hit the nail on the head when she describes Blanche and her children. I felt as if I were there. This is a good book, with an insight that is great. I couldn't put it down - although I agree that many questions were left unanswered."
4,Another GREAT Kinsey Milhone Novel,"Sue Grafton writes another GREAT Kinsey Milhone story. Between dealing with a delinquent teenager, the ex-wife of the missing person and the ex-stripper and present wife of the missing person, Kinsey also has to deal with a romantic advance that takes a deadly turn.Dr. Dowan Purcell is the missing person and a suspect in Medicare fraud. Unfortunately, he hasn't been seen in nine weeks even though the police have conducted a thorough investigation. Strangely enough, it's the ex-wife who asks for Kinsey's help to locate him.The ending doesn't completely wrap-up the crime but, all in all, it is worth the read..."
2,Has it Ended Yet?,"I was very unsatisfied the ending or should I say non-ending of this book. I even went to my local book store and scaned several copies to make sure my copy wasn't missing the last several pages. As avid Sue Grafton readers know, Kinsey always writes a summary of her report at the end of the book. This ties up all the loose ends. This book left us all hanging and my only hope is that Ms. Grafton's next book is titled Q is for Question no more the ending of P . . . I will clear it up for you in this book."
2,Not the Best in the Alphabet series,"Like many of the other reviewers, I've read all of the alphabet series. This installment ended very abruptly and did not seem finished. I was very disappointed in this book. I hope that others who read this as their first Sue Grafton novel will try another before judging the entire series."
2,Q is for I Quit!,"Oh, I am so disappointed! I have faithfully read this series from A-O and been thrilled with the writing, story and characters. Wow, what a change in this book. It rambles, seems to be missing sections and yikes, the ""ending""! I'm sitting here saying ""why did I spend the last few hours reading this book""? Either the author is burned out or it was a editor's hatchet job. I wouldn't even consider purchasing Q, at best I'll borrow it from the library. Bummer!"
3,Not Her Best,"I really didn't find either storyline to be compelling, and from the way they were wrapped up (or rather, not wrapped up), I'm betting the author didn't either.Quite disappointing from Ms. Grafton."
3,My perception of the ending.....,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxif you think about the ending......the very last page almost.......it is implied that Crystal and Nica are lovers.....motivation for bumping off the hubbyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4,Grafton never fails,I enjoyed this book most entertaining a good read.. holds the interest of the reader. Another Grafton novel that keeps one up all night.
1,where was the ending?,"I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED HER BOOKS, BUT THIS ONE JUST ENDED..HINTS AND I THINK WE KNOW WHAT THE CONCLUSION WAS BUT AGAIN, WHERE WAS THE ENDING?"
3,Alphabet Author,"The MarginI believe this is my last alphabet mystery. Not because Grafton isn't a good author, she is. For me the newness has worn off and that is only because no one single protagonist, i.e. Kinsey Millhone can hold my attention, therefore my interest, beyond four or five novels. Except Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series. I guess there are always exceptions. Anyway, there is nothing new to learn about Millhone and for me that is a big part of why I like to read-to learn about the characters.In ""P is for Peril"" there are sufficient surprises to hold your interest all the way through so don't allow what I said in the first paragraph to discourage you from checking it out from your local library.Marvin Wiebener, author of THE MARGIN and soon to be released THE MORIAH RUSE."
4,Probably has some of the best lines of the series,"The fact of the matter is that I pretty much love all of the Kinsey Milhone adventures. While some are better than others, I feel that Sue Grafton has a pretty good feel for popping out a more-than-decent mystery and this is one of them. I also feel it has some of the sassier writing Sue Grafton has dealt out along with another mystery. It's more white-collar tan I prefer, but it's still Kinsey and it's still fun."
1,"""P is for Pedantic""","This is the first Grafton book I've read. If it's any indication of the quality of her other books, this will be the last. Some of this book reads like a printout of driving directions from mapquest...""I took such-and-such road to another road and stopped. I looked left and then turned..."" who cares??? She drones on and on with minutiae which drag out the story and bore the reader. The rest of the book is like reading the weather forecast, as the reader is subjected to minutiae regarding the clouds, the mist, the rain. Big deal. Who cares? Boring. Pedantic. Predictable."
2,Unreal Characters and Plot,"I'm a Kinsey Millhone fan, but this novel is warped. The subplot destroys what could have been a good one. So Kinsey's attracted to Tommy? I could not believe she would change that attraction to her dumb-dumb vigilante mode INSTANTLY--on the word of a total stranger! Why didn't she at least go to Texas and nose around? Then she wouldn't have been suckered by a femme fatale con artist, who herself was unreal. (The ""insurance investigator"" is so smart and sharp looking, but with a dumb low-life brother?? Come on.)I guess Grafton wants us to think Kinsey's infallible, but no one is, and that's why we have a Constitution and courts, folks. Where's Grafton been? Last I heard, juries were convicting the retarded, the insane, and the innocent, and these poor (people) were getting death sentences--ESPECIALLY in Texas. Come into the real world, Sue. Put Kinsey back in jail a while, and let her see what's really going on."
3,Huh?,"I love Kinsey Millhone and have read every book in this series. What I love most about them is that Kinsey doesn't take herself seriously and knows that we aren't taking her seriously either. It is fun light reading for those times when you don't really want to use your brain too much!This book, however left me feeling like I had missed something. I reread the last chapter three times and still felt like there was some connection I wasn't drawing. When every other ending in the Alphabet Series has been tied up in a neat little bow, this one left me feeling unsatisfied, and frankly, unhappy."
3,Getting a little musty,"I love Sue Grafton's books, but this one disappoints. The plot is skimpy and just peters out. I think Ms. Grafton needs to take a long vacation and come back fresh to her series.--Lan Sluder"
1,P is for Pretty Darned Boring,"I have read every book that Sue Grafton has written and looked forward to this latest release. What a disappointment. This book was SO BORING I had difficulty staying awake to finish it. I never did figure out what the entire plot was supposed to be about. And for heaven's sake, who was Anica? I must have dozed off during her first introduction. To sum it up, Despite the fact I bought the hard copy edition, I have no desire to pass it on to anyone else. 1 star is too high of a rating. Shame on you Sue Grafton."
3,P is for Perplexed,"I waited axiously for this book to be released as I have with all of the Alphabet Murders. After finishing ""P"", I quickly logged on to Amazon to see if my book had the right number of pages! I was sure my copy was defective and was missing a chapter. I read the other reviews and found most people felt the same way. Where was the ending? Did one person do it? Did two? Both scenarios were suggested but not proven. I was very disappointed in this book and I'm hoping ""Q"" answers my questions."
5,P is for Plenty Good!,"I don't understand why everyone is so confused about the ending of the book. Duh, it's as plain as day! I stayed up all night reading, and am eagerly awaiting Q....."
1,P is for Painful,"I've read/listened to every other Kinsey Milhone story and liked most of them, but this one really disappointed me. This is the only Sue Grafton book I would say was a stinker. It was rambling and crammed with dull details and I had to make a real effort to finish the book. I listened to the unabridged audio version and when I got the ""end"" I was afraid that perhaps I had listened to the tapes out of order and had missed something. The narration was also pretty flat.It was lacking in the usual wit and cleverness, with too many characters to keep straight, vanishing plots, a whole book of red herrings. Kinsey came off as pretty unlikeable. It was as though Sue Grafton got tired and decided to just stop where she was and say ""The End"".I hold out hope for ""Q"" but will read the reviews before buying instead of after. New readers to the series should start with ""A is for Alibi"" and just skip ""P"" altogether."
2,Disappointed,"The story wasn't bad, it's just that the book ended abruptly. There was no resolution to the main story line and no ""respectfully yours"" comment at the end. I felt like someone grabbed the book out of Sue Grafton's hands and sent to the publisher."
2,Where is the end of the story?,I had a PDF copy of this book from a friend and when I got to the end I thought I was missing the last few pages because there is no killer identified. So I went to The kindle store and bought the book only to find there is no end to the story. This was confirmed by a friend with a copy of the book. So now I'm frustrated that I read the whole bloody book and the author opted to not finish it. I feel ripped off after going and buying the book again for $7.99 and I still have no resolution. Grrr. Very disappointing. Especially after really enjoying the series up until now.
3,Grafton digresses a bit with this effort.,"A good read, but not quite 'up to' the quality of her earlier books in the series. It's difficult to 'get to 26' and keep them all up to her standards of excellence; however, without doubt, Sue Grafton is at the very top of my list of sleuths."
2,P is for Peril,"Sue Grafton's latest started out fine, but I was a little disappointed with the ending. I read the final chapter twice and was still wondering ""who did it"". My question is, who and why? In previous books, there has been an epilogue ""Respectfully submitted by Kinsey Millhone summing up her findings. I loaned the book to a friend and she came up with the same conclusion. I sincerely hope ""Q is for Quarry"" answers some of these questions."
4,P is not for pat,With each book it seems Grafton becomes a bit more sophisticated. Unlike her previous books which the perpetrator gets hers or his; this book doesn't have a pat ending. Her characters are believable and entertaining. She gives them depth in such a masterful way. In the real world could this crime really ever be solved? She can't put her next one out fast enough for me.
3,not one of her best,"I got to the last page of this book and expected more. The book was pretty good, but the ending wasn't what I was looking for and definitely not so soon. What happened to the last few pages?"
3,Color Me Disappointed,"I have been a fan of Sue Grafton's for years. I forgave the ""M"" debacle because it seemed so personal. However, this one, I'm not so sure. I do not like a book where I have more questions after I've read it than when I started. And, IMHO, the ending was entirely too abrupt. I turned the page to see if there was more. I was horribly disappointed to find the pages empty. I hope ""Q"" is better."
2,Where's the rest of it?,"I am a huge Grafton/Millhone fan, but I was left wanting with this latest novel. The main plot, itself, didn't really ring true. The subplot was much more interesting, but was so brief that I was disappointed even with that.The ending seemed tacked on. I felt that Grafton was in a hurry or tired of writing and so just threw it together. I also didn't like how it leaves the reader hanging - who actually did it, anyway?I'm still a huge fan, but I'm not impressed with the ""P"" novel - let's hope ""Q"" is better."
3,I don't get it,"Perhaps this should be on a Grafton message board, but I did not understand this book; to the extent that I went to Borders because I thought my copy did not have all the pages. The Amazon page shows 384 pages and my copy ended at 370 and the line '...until Jonah arrived'. What's up? Kinsey, seeing Anica and Crystal together apparently had an epiphany, but I certainly missed it. Is that really the end of the book? Along with one of the other reviewers I thought the two brothers were superfluous to the plot; it's almost as if Ms. Grafton had to fill space.To me, very jumbled. Sorry."
3,Fun and Frustrating,"The alphebet series has provided many hours of enjoyment. This latest installment is entertaining with an interesting plot and amusing characters. However, the ending is abrupt and provides only a single obscure clue to the killer. In fact, the clue is more of a mystery than the book itself. Very unsatisfying!"
3,Loose ends,"This was a good book, but it lacked the crisp answers we are used to seeing in a Grafton book. It had a good basic plot line, but the obvious red herrings detracted from the story. The ending, while interesting, did not wrap, or tie in, all of the story lines and subplots. A good read, but not the emotionally taut novel O is for Outlaw was. Still, it held your interest even with the predictable ending. I'll buy Q when it comes out."
2,Not her best,"An interesting plot but ms Grafton lost my interest quickly as she did not convey any depth to her characters. Usually she creates tension not only by the mystery and danger in her books but also holds your interest as you wonder about the characters thoughts and motivations. Sadly not this time. Still it remains a reasonable read if you're bored. But you might find yourself flicking forward as, I did, hoping to find a more gripping part of the story and sadly not finding any."
3,Disappointing and self-indulgent,"This letter mystery goes no where. The characters are unappealing and uninteresting, the ""case"" has too many parts, and the B story is contrived. All in all, it wasn't worth the effort to read."
2,"P for ""P U""","The only ""peril"" in this book was the disappointment at the end. I have read A through O and have enjoyed them and was looking forward to this book. What a disappointment! I would not recommend this book...rather turn the TV on and watch another rerun of ""Lavern and Shirley"". If refunds are being given, where do I get in line for mine? Let's hope ""Q"" returns to the quality we expected ""P"" to be."
3,Skip this one and wait for Q,"As a long-time Kinsey Millhone fan--from A to O, I was disappointed by this entry into the series. While Kinsey is an enjoyable heroine and the 80s were the last heyday for traditional private eyes (before cell phones and the internet) the story here was lacking Grafton's great character development. Very few of the characters were appealing and nothing much happens of interest in Kinsey's personal life. The plot is pretty slow going until the end when everything gets solved in an unbelievable rush and in a very unsatifying way.I gave this book three stars since I am still Kinsey fan despite my disappointments in plot and character development. Here's to hoping ""Q"" will be a return to Grafton's winning formula for Kinsey."
3,P - Is for pondering,"I liked the book until the end. I was left with too many unanswered questions and I felt cheated. I spent time and energy reading this book that left me asking questions.You had twist coming at you from a lot of areas, which is fine, but very few are ever worked through. This bugged me and left me frustrated.This is the first of the series that I read, and I am wondering do they all end this unfulfilling?If so, I think Q should be Quit, please."
3,Not the best Grafton I've read,"I'm in agreement with some of the others. This book just does not do it for me either. I'm a great Kinsey fan and usually Ms. Grafton's story are fast-paced and exciting. This one just isn't I figured out the stuff about one of Purcell's wives right from the beginning, so that probably didn't help. I found the stuff about double-dealing in the Health Care industry intersting, and that is why I gave this book a 3 instead of a 2. I also liked the chrasimatic landlords that Kinsey was involved with, but again, all that transpired there was pretty predictable as well.I will contine to read the series, but I hope Ms. Grafton gets her drive back again before ""Q"". I'm finding the series is losing momentum."
2,P is for Poop,"I have enjoyed most of Sue Grafton's books, but this one totally disapointed me. Where was the epilogue? I know all books don't wrap up in a nice little package, but hers usually do. I felt I was missing an entire chapter. It was a nice rollercoaster ride that ended in poop."
5,Sequel to J is for Judge,"New readers might want to know that some of the characters and action (set in 1986) follow from J is for Judge, rather than from O is for Outlaw (the one about her ex-husband) and in fact she gives away the ending of J is for Judge. If, like me, you buy every Grafton without even waiting for the paperback, then there's no problem."
4,"Good product, good price","Arrived quickly, decent condition, works great. Just plug it in and go, didn't even have to install anything or set anything up. Finally, I can use my cd drive again! :)"
3,Unless you've got an unending budget this will do.,I think for the money that Kenwood is offering a pretty good package. I am not an avid movie watcher but just have a theater to entertain guests. The quality of the Kenwood system is middle of the road. If you are looking for the best shop elsewhere. If you are looking for good enough at a realistic price this is it. As a sidebar the speakers are a little bigger and heavier than others at a comparable price. This is not a bad thing but don't let the store sell you on the universal wall mounts for them.
2,It's all about the BLOOD and GORE!,"Saw was good, because it was creating a new genre and it was original and on a league of it's own. Saw 2 is not as good in my opinion. It's very disturbing at times, because it's so graphic and violent and so much blood and gore that by the end of it I was repulsed by it. Why was this low-budget horror film so bloody successful?! They are already making Saw 3 now. The cast had very little appeal to me in this film. Yes, it is shot in Toronto and I did recognized my friend Ho""Oyster"" who played the cop and he just had two lines. I guess I am not really into this kind of nasty gore feast. I prefer horror films that have more intricate storyline and not ""cutting up body parts kind of stuff"". It's got a niche market and it works for that target audiences. I am not looking forward to see another Saw."
2,SAW II,"whoa this movie was so disappointing, the premise of this movie is so awful with no developing characters they just get killed off like some bad slasher movie..weak"
2,Hollywoodized,"This series has a lot of potential going for it, but unfortunately this film is hampered by an illogical screenplay. Does anyone remember Stigmata? Saw II has the same style cinematography and editing (which is quite irritating), minimal character development(which is a key factor to building suspense), one predictable horror movie cliche after another, the fact that they show the mysterious killer all through the movie(whose brain fart was responsible for this catastrophic mistake), sadly the scary factor goes quietly down the drain. One good thing Saw 11 has going for it are the death scenes that are sometimes interesting, nasty and inventive. Saw II tries real hard to be a good film, but the MTV style direction and pacing(think a childs attention span) eventually pulls it under. Watch the far superior and original Cube instead."
5,Great Movie!,I loved the first saw movie and this one was even better. I think this is one of the only cases in which the sequel was better than the first. This was the best movie I have ever seen.
4,Saw II--The Reprieve,"If you liked ""Saw,"" you'll like #2. Twists and turns, revelations and plots, plots-within-plots, and a resolution that begs for Saw III.I liked it, especially late at night with a cold drink and some popcorn."
3,Question,Not a review but a question. Does this work on UK Playstations as only SAW III is available on Region B for some reason?
4,Really good,"I actually enjoyed it more than the first one. I knew there would be a twist ending so I was looking for that right away. And I was still surprised at the end. Add that to some really gruesome scenes and you got yourself a good horror movie. I'm not saying it's the best horror ever, but I still give it a 4 out of 5."
3,NOT AS SHARP AS THE FIRST SAW,"I was a bit disappointed in this sequel to the blockbuster Saw. Don't get me wrong, it's better than the vast majority of movies in the horror genre, but I was not blown away by it as I expected, I figured out the twist early in the movie. Wahlberg is very good as is Tobin Bell, honestly, if you get even descent acting in movies like this, it needs to be appreciated, verdad? The ways Jigsaw comes up with to torture his victims is inspired is suppose, but i really didnt like the setting, it looked like a tacky stage set, I just kept thinking, wow the producers must make so much money of these films because they spend a buck fifty on the sets and all the no name, mostly very bad actors, I especially disliked the female cop, she was awful and the dumb Morequa that played the narcotics dealer, I mean where the F do they find these people?..overall, NOT as good as the first, but still recommended if you are into this sort of thing."
4,"Slightly worse than the first one, still a very good thriller","The weakest among the 3 entries so far. There are still a lot traps and is still enjoyable to see how gruesome they are, though not as good as those in the last movie. Still an important and must entry as the storyline is connected to both the last and the next episode.If there is no comparison to the first or third part, this single movie will be a good one.It is just the other 2 are soooo good."
4,Very good transfer...but could be better.,Good movie with a quality picture and sound...although I think the first Saw looked and sounded a little better. I am pleased but am also hopefull that I will be blown away by a title's transfer soon.1080p Sony LCD
2,Saw 1 was good this was not,This was nothing compared to the originality of saw #1.the plot sucked and the acing was nothing to talk about.
2,fail to fit in the franchise and sadly the top box office of all SAW,poorly filmed with no good directingand character develop in a wrong directionso it might be entertaining by all the bloody gorybut this film is a biggest failure in all seriesbtw the plot was written for a scary moviebut IGN took it in
4,in my opinion 4 stars b/c its actually a good sequel,"Great sequelI saw this movie in the theater and I really enjoyed it! It is in my opinion way better that the first Saw. It keeps you guessing the whole movie and just when you think you have it figured out, another twist develops and you're wrong again. I really loved it and look forward to adding the DVD to my collection.Don't get me wrong the first saw is ok but its rare that a sequel is better than the first...I just wanna say you have 2 types of people on amazon, the type who really likes something and the type who hates on everyone for liking it, not because they think its bad but because they don't want to jump on the wagon like everyone else and admit its a good movie..."
2,Saw has become Blunt,"After seeing the first Saw I was so looking forward to this one. But I had my worries. I loved the first one, but unfortunatly this doesnt come to the standards of the original. I have noticed how people have compared the original Saw to the film Cube with its similarities. Saw 2 not only has similarites, but looks almost exactly like it. People locked in a house full of traps, entering the first room to get to the second. Sure this film is a lot better than Cube, but it could have done a lot better than this. Throughout the film when something big is about to happen, it just comes across different death scenes like slasher films. Saw is NOT a slasher film. Saw 2, however, follows in its footsteps, finding an easy way out. Its like they just want to get this film over with. Saw 2 still has a neat ending but also added something a little silly to it. Not half as good as the ending to the original. Overall, Saw 2 isnt rubbish. It just seems a little pointless."
2,Let's not play anymore little games!,"There are no surprises in this second Saw movie anymore. Again Jigsaw the Great has created a mysterious sadistic masterplan to have his victims appreciate their lives a bit more. This time however watching the movie you simply don't believe the story anymore. I think the first Saw was splendid, but they should not have made a sequel. (SARR)"
2,Worse than New Kids On the Block!,"This sequel to a great film is the type that teases you for the first 60 minutes, then tries to surprise you at the end and recap all of the previous scenes. This movie wasn't much fun to watch at all. While there were a few intense and gory scenes that were pulled off really well, most of the story lacked originality and the acting by Donnie from The New Kids was only mediocre.By the end of the movie, you just won't care about the mystery anymore, and when you finally figure it out, you will care even less. A real dissapointment from the first SAW."
3,"Good, but not like the original","Saw 2 is not quite as good as the first one but it still does a pretty good job of pulling its own weight. Once again the ending is very unpredictable. The death traps are as good as ever, but it does not have the original taste that the first Saw movie has, but still a very entertaining movie to watch."
3,Filler,"Not the best fil I've ever seen, not the worst. Saw 2 has it's moments but my primary disagreement is the lack of subtlety in the attrosities commited. the first was inticing more because of the anonimity of the jigsaw killer, not to mention the low scale puzzels involved, that it was more plausible an occurance. number two, while still task appropriet, left some of the subtle charm out of the gore, and lacked the realism opting more forl hollwood glitz & glamor."
2,An Extremely Disappointing Sequel,"The first Saw, while gross and distasteful, is pretty good. This very disappointing sequel, however, takes the disgust and gore to another level. Most movies these days, like Saw II, Hostel, and Wolf Creek, are more interested in making its viewers vomit rather than concentrating on a decent horror plot. The twist is so expected, even if you can't figure it out, that it doesn't have the same effect as the first movie. While the twist is mildly clever, the completely disgusting effects doom this movie from the beginning and it never fully recovers; a terrible movie."
2,Dumb people in house die,"SPOILERS***********Here we go again. The bad guy wants people to change their ways, so why not open a counseling center; no, instead through some source of funding and high understanding of electronics, etc...he puts together grand schemes in which people get killed. The ending of the movie was a complete joke. Why would one of the abductees work for someone that tried to kill her? She was thrown into a pit of needles and still she plays along; I think she would have just given up. Innocent people die around her and she doesn't care to help them. Also, the people in the house work against eachother for some odd reason,rather than help eachother out. Where did the bad get the nerve gas and antidote. Nothing like that is explained. I think in the next movie they should have everyone work together and then defeat the bad guy/girl. Finally give us some satisfaction."
1,Wow. This movie sucks bad.,"Its about a bunch of people who are locked in a house and die in different ways. No seriously. Thats it. If you enjoy watching people die with a little soap opera plot attempt thrown in....this is for you. Its violent. Big deal. So is Shindler's List and we're not calling that a horror movie, now are we? The JR High kids should love it."
3,"ENOUGH OF THE DOUBLE, TRIPLE DIPPING!!!","This isn't so much a review of the ""Saw"" series itself as it is my gripe about the franchise release on Blu Ray disc. When I first got into the series, I bought the DVDs, only to see a subsequent ""unrated cut"" released shortly thereafter and even, in some cases (as was with ""Saw III""), a ""director's cut."" Being the fan that I am, yes, I bought whatever newer version came out and took the older versions to the used CD stores... What is the studio waiting for with regards to ""Saw: Uncut Edition,"" ""Saw II: Special Edition,"" and ""Saw III: Director's Cut""? Enough is enough! My all-time favorite movie trilogy is ""The Lord of the Rings,"" but as tempted as I am to get the upcoming Blu Ray release (as I know it will be visually stunning), I refuse to shell out one dime until the extended editions make it to Blu Ray. The same applies to the ""Saw"" series and any other franchise."
2,Saw was SO much better!,"Kind of boring, not as unique and creative as the first ""Saw."" Wouldn't recommend."
2,Creating/Ruining a Franchise,"The biggest problem with the movie is that it's a painfully obvious attempt to cash in on a surprise hit.Of course, most of the greatness of Saw was made by its twist ending. In this one, we get another one. It's a twist I found extremely disapointing and unnecessary. (But of course... it was put in to say there will be another one...)What made the first movie so great? It didn't follow a formula. What made this one bad? It follows a formula.Whereas the first one did so much with so little, this one does so little with so much.I can't honestly believe that they thought the movie was going to be better by simply multiplying the number of victims.What we get here is a bunch of pretty WB type faces, reacting overly dramatic, getting unexpectedly killed one by one. How original...Let's face it folks... it's been done before...This isn't Saw, this is Final Destination...How disapointing..."
5,Suprise Ending!!!!!!!!,I was excited to see this movie since Saw was soooooooo good! I loved this one too. Very creative with lots of twists and turns! It keeps you on your toes.......... The game keeps you thinking from beginning till the end!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great thriller!!
4,Not as good as the first but real close,"The main difference in this movie is Jigsaw. In the first one you didn't know who he was and saw very little of him. In the second you see quite a bit of him. This is both a plus and a negative. On the positive side jigsaw is a very interesting character and is played very well. But on the other hand the mystery of, who is he?, adds something to the first movie that this one is missing. This installment has just as many well thought out traps and Scenario's. And yes at the end you get just as much of a suprise as the first. One other diffence between Saw II and Saw was that in the first one I was able to guess nothing! But in the second I was able to guess one or two things. Nothing major though.If you like the first Saw go rent this one right now!"
2,Logic be damned,"No wonder he gets away, the cops are so stupid. When dealing with a manipulator, why begin by allowing him to control the rules and location? If the participants are victims of bad cops, why are they punished? Too stupid to be enjoyed."
2,WARNING: NOT ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIO,"Despite the fact that this is the widescreen ratio, beware: THIS DVD CROPS THE ORIGINAL FILM.Lion's Gate Home Video has apparently made a corporate decision to crop all widescreen films from their theatrical aspect ratios to the 1.78:1 ratio of 16:9 widescreen TVs. While this means a somewhat negligible picture loss for Saw II, which had an original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, it's still ""reformatting to fit your screen"" that should be warned of on the disc package and before the film itself."
2,A Pale Reflection of its Parent,"Having enjoyed ""Saw"", I was looking forward to seeing the sequel. More of the same. A plot with twists. Slightly unrealistic characters but, nonetheless, a good edge of the seat thriller.Unfortunately, ""Saw II"" was a bit of a letdown compared with its predecessor. The plot was too far fetched and the traumas often too predictable. It's one of those cases where the child fails to live up to live up to the parent. The end is obviously left open for a further sequel. However, I can only hope that the producers resist the urge to continue down this path unless in possession of better script."
2,Not as good as the first...,"Saw is one of my all time favorite horror flicks. The plot is so clever, the acting is right on point, and the dialouge flows nicely. But Saw II is a complete mess. Whereas the first one seemed to focus more on a well written script and thought provoking plot, the sequel focuses more on shock value. I guess it depends on what you find entertaining. If you enjoy lots of blood and gore than you'll probably love it, but if you like a plot with a little bit of depth than this isn't the movie for you. The only highlight for me was the ending...which sets up a good opening for part 3."
5,A Rare Sequel Thats Even Better Then The Original.,Saw II is the rare sequel that you find thats even better then the original (and the original was great). The story is easy to follow and full of suspense. The story twists and turns at every corner to the point where you think just about anything could happen. The acting was great and full of known actors. I dont quite understand the poing of Beverly Mitchell who is a decent name in acting and plays such a useless role in the film. The DVD extras on this film are well worth getting the DVD. They have a making of each of the torture devices section. They tell you just how each of the effects were accomplished and its really interesting. there are other good bonus features too. You wont be dissapointed with this DVD!
2,Messy...but not in a good way.,A long time ago there was a movie called Seven that was clever and disturbing beautifully made and had riveting performances.Those days are long gone.Now we get horror movies hurriedly slopped together for a quick buck.The filmmakers think up a few nice twists for the ending and pad out the rest of the movie with a bunch of jerks wandering around a house falling into various deathtraps like idiots.As a fan of the glory days of 70s low budget horror films I have to say there's nothing all that shocking here despite some really annoying flashy editing gimmicks that dilute the effect of gruesome scenes.The cast is unlikable and the killer mastermind practically catatonic(imagine Christopher Walken in his place...that would've been creepy)so there's little to hold your interest between predictable death scenes.Good twist at the end but not as good as the orginal and a good horror film should have more to offer than a climatic surprise to be truly scary.
3,Unbelievable Plot makes this one just a gory DEATH FEST!,"Special Effects, Gore, Violence, a serious DEATHFEST. Yup this movie has a lot of that stuff but has problems with characters that are not believable. Would you cut off a big chunk of the back of your neck to see a number (what if you cut off the wrong area of your neck?), or ask, or even threaten other people around you to read it? The plot twist made the movie even more unbelievable. I don't want to give away some of the plot to explain just what I mean, but there are several unrealistic character moves like this that takes away the scariness of the movie. The First SAW had my heart thumpin fast!! IT really made me feel that hypervenilating feel. SAW 2 did not give me that same uneasiness as the first movie. The characters and plot of SAW are more believable. NOT a bad movie, has more death and gore, but definately could of been better!!!!"
1,Saw II DVD,i was very disappointed that the movie did not have a cover and i bought a brand new copy of it
1,No where as great as Hostel,"How does anyone say the Saw movies are better than Hostel,these movies don't deliver anywhere near the amoount of carnage that movies like Hostel and Wolf Creek do. These movies are soft enough for elementary kids to watch. The gore doesn't match up to Hostel and the story doesn't match up to Seven. This movie doesn't deliver on either level its suppose to."
3,Better then the first one and has some distrubing and scary moments,Better then the first one and has some distrubing and scary moments but it still dosnet mean it's a great movie. I would sat I liked it but it dosent come close to being the best horro film or a classic. The acting is not the greatest but it's better then the first one. There is more of a story in thsi one and there are not pointless charactors and it dosnet drag like the first one. Overall it's worth watching to see a gory disturbing and scary film.
4,A Horror Movie Legacy,"Not to bore w/ all the details that others have written, but can anyone see this as being one of the horror movies that has 7 sequels spun off of it. Hollywood has lost it's flare when it comes to horror flicks, but SAW is one of the films they got right this time. True, there wasn't enough blood and gore, but the suspense and plot compensated for the lack thereof. I'm sure we'll be seeing more of Jigsaw's protege in the future. If there's one lesson to be learned form this movie, it's that ""Patience is a virtue""."
2,saw 2 -ok-2.5 stars,"saw 2 -ok-2.5 stars, February 14, 2006Reviewer: James M. Hawk (columbus, ohio United States) - See all my reviewswhile saw 2 is fun and entertains, it actually lies to its audience about PLAYING BY THE RULES. I am not buying the quick explanation that so many movies do because they try explain the movie like we did not already know. its a slap to the viewers intelligence and renders the movie ultimately cheap. mtv camera cuts really do not help the effect or tone of the movie. I just think we deserved more. hopefully the SAW 3 will bring a finite feeling to the franchise."
5,A Little Better than the First Saw,"The acting went from below average in SAW to pretty decent in SAW II. The story was similar to the original and there was plenty of gore as well. I enjoyed the flick Hostel a little more than both SAW films, but this one will sit proudly in my DVD collection right beside the first SAW."
3,Fun little gorefest,"Not in the same suspense league as its predecessor, but this one is fun in the ""how many gross ways can you kill someone"" vein. Overall stupidity of the characters is a huge drawback, but it has enough scenes that make you groan or look away that it is an alright pick for a dumb grossout film."
4,"Yep, It's Good!","I was highly skeptical going into this film, but the tight plot, excellent writing and taut suspense completely won me over. If you liked the first Saw, or enjoy crime thrillers with a horror twist... you will like this film."
4,SAW II,"Look, I know that a lot of people discredit the Saw franchise because a) they can seem to be normal slasher flicks or of the like, b) it is a franchise that seems to be in it for the money, not necessarily the development of the plot. However, if you happen to have a more conservative outlook on crime and punishment, then these movies might be for you, if you do not mind extreme blood and gore that is. However, if you do decide to get these movies, just watch it from the first one, otherwise you kinda kill the thrill, but that's just me."
3,"oh yes , their will be blood ...","This follow up to the first saw film is good but not as good as the first one . Unlike other revewers i'm not going to blow the ending for you ... however , i would like to say i ""saw"" it coming (tee hee)!I just hope saw 3 doesn't crap out and turn out like the screem films (who's GHOSTFACE now ?) I know JIGSAW has cancer , but when he does die I hope he comes back as a FREDDY or CANDYMAN like monster who would be some what like the SPECTOR or GHOSTRIDER from comics .He would be able to single out anyone and teach them to appreciate their lives ... threw hellish games in side their own minds !... or if if he doesn't die and reveals he never had cancer in the first place ... that would be cool too because that would mean he's been playing games with people for his own amusement just like HANNIBAL LECTER !"
4,REMEMBER THE RULES !,"Darren Lynn Bousman's 'SAW II' is without a doubt one of the best sequel's in horror movie history! You can officially add 'SAW II' to the short line of excellent horror movie sequel's such as 'Halloween 2''Friday the 13th part 2''Evil Dead 2''Aliens' & ofcourse the more recent 'The Devil's Rejects' While not quite the masterpiece that part 1 is,it's pretty damn close & yes there is plenty of blood. The very beginning of this flick is disturbingly great!"
3,Saw II,"Jigsaw is at it again in this sequel to the do-you-appreciate-your-life saga. Five people are trapped in a house with no way out. There is toxic fumes coming out of the vents, and these fumes are slowly killing the victims. The antidote is around the house somewhere. Like in the first movie, we find out a little something about each person there. Meanwhile, a detective is looking for his son, who is in the house with the other four.This is bloodier than the first. Is it better? Maybe. The ending will shock you as it did me. From the sounds of it, there's going to be a Saw 3.Watch Saw 2 and judge for yourself. I, personally, thought it was just ok."
5,This book is amazing!,I am 17 and I have read and reread this book. I have also done research trying to find any other information I could find on the Doss family. So far my search has not been to rewarding. I have not found what I am looking for. Anyone that has any information on the Doss family I would love to know what happen to them! It is my favorite book and I have never felt such a wonderful love of reading then when I read this book.
5,My Inspiration,"Over five years ago, on a homeschool fieldtrip, I came across a pile of discarded library books. The pile was going to be taken to the recycling factory, the next day. An avid reader, my interest was not only in the amount of books sitting there in boxes, but also in the many old and worn looking books. Being told I could look through and take any books I wanted, I quickly picked up one called ""The Family Nobody Wanted"" by Helen Doss, and continued looking. On the way home I started reading the book and haven't put it down. Since that cloudy day over five years ago, I continue to read and enjoy the story of Helen Doss and her wonderful family. I am inspired over and over as she displays constant joy and patience in her children. I've always wanted a large family, and with her as my hero, I hope to one day be a mother to twelve children also!"
5,Excellent service,"This book was received in excellent condition as it was listed on Amazon. Also, the book was received in a quick manor. Thanks!"
5,The Family Nobody Wanted,What a wonderful book. I first read it in the 1960s. The story inspired me to adopt my son from Vietnam in 1973. Unfortunately I had my original copy stolen many years ago and never thought that I would be able to obtain another copy.THANKYOU Amazon.
5,Inspiring,My fifth grade teacher introduced me to this book back in the late 60's and I must have read it a dozen times. It is a wonderfully told story that inspired and influenced me in many ways. I highly recommend this book for readers of all ages.
1,High hopes and disappointment,"The MFC 5440CN purported to have all of the features I could want: networked scanning, faxing, and printing at an affordable price. And I could even use it on my Linux system thanks to the drivers from Brother. My hope in this product has been steadily diminished. The scanning still does not work in Linux. Since upgrading the firmware on board, I have lost scanning functionality even in Windows XP. The ink runs out QUICKLY. I run multiple cleaning cycles just to make print-outs legible. Often, entire lines do not print, and the lines that do print have terrible white lines running through the text. If you prefer to spend time using the product rather than troubleshooting it, do not buy this product."
1,THIS IS JUNK,Do not buy it if you don't like going to get ink once a month. And guess what if you do not have ink you can't fax or scan either.
3,Okay for the price,"I was going to order this printer, and had gone through the checkout, and when I looked at the final screen, the shipping was approximately $60!!!! I bought a lesser Brother model for my parents last Christmas and they have had great results.Beware of the shipping!------Shortly after my review Amazon started carrying the printer again instead of through a third-party. The shipping cost problem has been fixed. I now own one of these and it has been decent for the price."
4,"Excellent, however it can be improved",Everythig works fine with exception of the scanner software.This has to be fixed by BROTHER.
4,Superior customer service,There were some issues with the product at delivery and we were truly impressed with how quickly and fully the service unit addressed our concerns to our 100 % satisfaction. I would certainly return to this vendor.
1,Poor quality and design,"The black ink works after just 18 months, cleaning many times, try ahcohol to clean it, still not working ,had to throw whole set away, very bad product, I will never buy any Brother product again.The design is that when any ink run out, you can not do anyting, and even you do not use, the ink dry itself, (it cleaning every few days by itself, using your inks)."
2,NOT GOOD,I bought this printer last year and was excited in the begining because of the network feature. My excitement faded away when I started using this printer. Printer quality is ok even if you use the best quality option.
2,Useless for envelopes,"Scans fine, prints ok. Haven't really noticed the obsessive self cleaning or abnormally high ink usage but I HAVE only successfully printed about 20% of the envelopes I have tried to print (about 20 out of 100!!) -- I even went for the more expensive ""for inkjet use"" envelopes thinking it was the cheap ones I was using that was jamming it. 1 prints fine (although not necessarily first), 2 come out, but they are smeared and printed on a slant, and then 2 just jam up completely. It is about to go out the window... I could live w/ the cumbersome loading of envelopes (and 1 at a time), but then for it to either ruin or eat them is infuriating."
1,Brother MFC-5440CN,"Incredibly poor user's Manual. Nothing on how to use the scanner function (refers you the CD -- most multi-use machines have a very easy to use scanning function -- NOT this one!Paper jams easily.Response time is slow.Printing quality has been the least satisfactory of any I've evwer used. I'm planning to use the rest of the ink supply, toss this machine, and return to a more dependable multi-purpose device brand."
1,Prepare to break the bank buying ink,"The print quality is good, but it uses all colors when printing (even though we only print in 'black'). Then when one of the colors gets low (about once a month or so) it won't print incoming faxes anymore - even though you have plenty of black ink!!! I absolutely dislike this machine and will never purchase another brother product like this one... unless I hit the lottery and feel like blowing all my cash on colored ink that I never see."
1,Don't buy this printer - much better out there.,"A money pit is right! This printer just isn't worth it. There were at least 3 times where I bought ink and even though I only used the printer 3 or 4 times over the course of 4 or 5 months, the ink was gone and I'd have to buy refills again! It appears the ink must be allowed to evaporate somehow, and furthermore if you run out of one color the whole printer is useless until you refil it! Regardless of whether you're printing in B&W;!Don't waste your money on this; there are much better printers out there."
2,Shuts down most functions if any ink cartrige runs low,"This printer wastes ink and shuts down when ink runs low. You can't even send a fax if you run out of one of the inks. Also, mine shows that the ink is empty when there is actually ink left.I recommend a printer from a vendor that is working to help you and your business, noe one that *seems* to be focused on getting you to buy un-needed ink.You can, however, put black electrical tape over part of the cartridge to continue printing and faxing when it claims ink cartridges are empty."
2,GREAT PRICE-GOOD COPIES-POOR QUALITY,"Purchased this machine about 6 months ago. It worked great until about 2 weeks ago. The red ink stopped printing. The Brother repair shop thinks it's either a bad print head or a faulty circuit board- he's unsure as to which...Yes, it's covered under warranty, but I'm reluctant to keep it after repairs. I probably printed less than 2 reams of paper before the problem started. Fax works very good; Scanner works OK but the paper port software is mickey mouse. B&W copy speed on best quality is slow, on normal quality it's slightly better. I will probably sell on Ebay at a loss, count my blessings and buy the Canon Pixma that I debated on before the Brother purchase."
5,Brother is the best,"I just got back from returning a lexmark 7100 series all-in-one.. (for your own good NEVER buy ANY lexmark printers, scanners, faxes, or especially all in ones) and I returned the piece of crap because they charge me another $130 to buy a lexmark printer server.. well I had already spent $80 on a print server about 6 months ago and I was NOT about to buy another one for $130.. so I take a trip to staples, and return the product, I started looking around the store for a BETTER all in one, and there it was.... the Brother Multi function, I spent $10 more on the Brother instead of the lexmark AND within minutes the Brother multi function was set up, printing, copying and faxing.. I can tell it what number to dial and fax something to somebody from downstairs on my laptop. This is simply the best buy in its catagory..ok, I am off to put my print server on[...]now.. have fun and I seriously hope you buy this product."
1,Do not buy this printer,I bought this printer less than a month ago and its already not working right. The paper keeps jamming.The paper tray is jammed and won't come out of the printer. I tried using the other paper feed and I get the same response that the paper is jammed. I wish I had paid attention to the amazon reviewer who mentioned the paper jam problem. This is my first and last time buying Brother.
2,Simple[minded] pantheism for preschoolers,"Arthur Schopenhauer once said, ""The chief objection I have to pantheism is that it says nothing. To call the world God is not to explain it; it is only to enrich our language with a superfluous synonym for the word 'world.'"" So it is with this very sweet, very shallow New Age book for tots. If you teach a child that God is present in a tree, then better not take him to a lumber mill. Illustrated with impressionistic oil paint daubings."
5,"Simple, but not really","The authors remind us all in a pure and simple way what the mystics and philosophers have tried to tell us for centuries. If the world could understand this simple message, we could tranform ourselves overnight, and live is bliss and peace. Thanks for waking me up, again"
4,"Get real, people!",I can't believe the uberPC people posting here. The truth is that there ARE stupid people and people who do stupid things. Get over it.
4,"Listener's Are Richer for Russell's ""Poor Man's Dream""","Tom Russell's ""Poor Man's Dream"" was my introduction to the artist several years ago and it remains one of my all-time favorite records. A gifted artist hitting his peak. Personal favorites include ""Veteran's Day"",""Spanish Burgundy"", and ""Blue Wing"". Fans who have since become fans of later albums will enjoy hearing these with the backing of a gifted band. A great intoduction to Russell and a must for die hards."
5,A true classic recording,"This is a great example of West Coast Jazz of the 1950's with an East Coast flare. The rhythm section is impeccable, a perfect groove provided by leader of the session Stan Levy on drums, tasteful comping and soloing by pianist Lou Levy anchored by the huge sound of bassist Leroy Vinegar. The horn line is in rare form with Conte Condoli on trumpet, Frank Rosolino trombone and long tall Dexter Gordon on tenor sax. My personal favorites- Monk's ""Ruby My Dear"", a perfect framework for Condoli's warm trumpet sound and ""Stanley The Steamer"", a cookin' blues feature of chorus after chorus of hot steamin' tenor sax by Dexter. Rosolino shines through out. The charts are a perfect blend of West Coast Cool and East Coast Heat. I first heard this album as a young man in the 1950's and lost track of it until the 90's. It has held up very well over the years. Great recorded quality, a warm to hot mix of some great classic jazz. Originally on Bethlehem records. Very cool cover art."
3,I like the older stuff better...,"when i first heard making bones, i had no idea it was red snapper. it's more focused on the hip-hop element and puts their usual vanguard jazz sound on the backburner. it's a strange mixture of ambient jazz-fusion, guitar noise and trip hop. this is not a soft and slow record. the music is noisy and the speed is usually breakneck. real drums and bass are looped and tweaked into an effective mix of creepy space jazz and electronics are layered to add depth. a couple of tracks feature trumpet and trombone and a few have rapping or soulful vocals. the main problem is that it's not something i could listen to everyday. what's more is that it isn't as good as most of their other releases."
4,WE'RE NOT IN BIRDLAND ANYMORE!,"RED SNAPPER IS A BAND OUT OF ENGLAND THAT DEFINES ITS MUSIC AS ""F__K-OFF JAZZ"". EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS I'M NOT SURE. WHILE ADMITTEDLY THIS IS NOT CHARLIE PARKER'S MUSIC, IT IS JAZZ NONETHELESS, ALBEIT ACID-JAZZ.THE RED SNAPPER SOUND IS A MIXTURE OF BREAKBEATS, ROCK, PUNK, RAP, AND TRADITIONAL JAZZ INSTRUMENTATION COMBINING BOTH LIVE INSTRUMENTS AND ELECTRONICS. SNAPPER'S MAIN TRIO CONSISTS OF RICHARD THAIR--DRUMS, DAVID AYER--GUITAR AND ALI FRIEND--DOUBLE BASS. THE GROUP IS JOINED ON THIS CD BY MC DET WHO RAPS ON 3 RATHER INTERESTING NUMBERS. BEST TRACKS--BOGEYMAN, THE TUNNEL AND SUCKERPUNCH. LOW POINT, ""IMAGE OF YOU"". WHILE ITS NOT BAD, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO FIT WITH THE REST OF THE MIX. OVERALL A GOOD PARTY CD."
3,Not worth 3 twenty-piece mcnuggets,"this cd has 4 good songs on it, the rest are so mediocre and the good ones don't make it worth the 16 bones it takes to procure it. my advice, go buy some chicken mcnuggets instead...and demand that they give you more sauce than the alloted 3 packets. Keep rock'n and reach'n for that rainbow."
3,Cute but really small,"I ordered this costume despite not knowing what size 1-2 meant. I had hoped that it meant one to two years, but when I received it, it actually was a size 6-12 months, which is far too small for what I needed. The costume was very cute and looked well made, just be aware that the sizes are very small."
4,Green Mansions,"a highly mystical book, parallel with the rise of existentialism in Europe, it is a real portrait of the temperature of europe at that time. an anti-romance unlike most, it deals more with the soul than the heart, bringing to light the animal and spiritual in the hero's evolution from youth to man. all set against the unrivaled beauty of the Amazon. very interesting book."
3,"Great insight, no citations","While this biography offered some good insight into the life of Eleanor Roosevelt, much of it was conjecturing ""she may have, might have"" etc. and little is cited save a blurb at the end of the book. I read this as part of a undergrad history class, but I'm certain there are better out there."
1,Osama probably uses this film to encourage his men,"Ha,ha,ha... I cann't understand why americans ask stupid question such as why Muslims want to kill them. This film is the answer."
1,How did Samuel Jackson get caught up in this mess,"This movie was derivative, rediculous and stupid. I wish I had my $7 back."
1,Disgraceful!,"This is a piece of disgraceful American jingoism, implying that all Arabs are evil, and that only the US can save the world. And the inference is that it's a true story - IT'S NOT! It's Stars and Stripes fiction of the most racist kind. And to cap it all, it's a huge waste of talented actors. It's the responsibilty of reasonable people to make sure that the young and naive never see this tripe. They could end up believing it's true."
3,"A Bit Contrived, But Entertaining","This story gets the viewer involved with it right away never lets up, with good performances all around, although Tommy Lee Jones stands out a bit above the rest. Samuel L. Jackson is always good and so is Director William Friedkin.There are some outstanding action scenes in the first 30 minutes and the 5.1surround system gets quite a workout. After that, the story settles down into a court battle.Its politics are typical Hollywood: the government is corrupt with the main villain the National Security Adviser who burns a video tape that would clear a U.S. Marine colonel from being framed for murder. It gets even more dramatic when two other witnesses lie and make justice look almost impossible to attain in the case. Throw in the usual PC race card, and there you have it. But, dramatics aside, it's an entertaining story."
2,"Unoriginal, Unrealistic","Prior to seeing this movie I was expecting an entertaining, quality show based on the cast alone. Unfortunately I was greeting with a tired script, bland characters, and an unrealistic portrayal of the military. Only ""The General's Daughter"" makes a bigger mockery of the service than this film does. If you want to get a quality, film about the military with good acting, get ""A Few Good Men"" instead."
3,"Not the best, but worth seeing once","This movie is on my very short list for an Oscar nod - for best sound. In the opening Vietnam sequence you could hear all the soldiers yelling and screaming as the camera panned in a circle showing all that was going on. This and other fine examples of the proper way to handle sound for a film can be seen in this movie, granted you have a state of the art home theater system or you saw ""Rules of Engagement"" in a modern theater with SDDS, DTS, or THX. There was some good performances (Guy Pearce, for one) and some pretty good action sequences. Worth a look."
1,Is this for real?,"Is this supposed to be a true story? The way the ""oh no we've ran out of film"" ending suddenly comes up, with all the text about ""what happens next"", you get the impression that it is.But it's not, is it? As another reviewer says, the implausible plot makes fools of some good actors trying their best.Would have been better if it had gone the ""A Few Good Men"" direction and placed Jackson as a man doing what he needs to do but not following the rules as they are written down.disappointing, dismal, dismissed."
1,Racism posing as 'art',"Rules of Engagment is quite possibly the most racist film I've ever seen. Now that stereotyping Hispanics, Orientals, Jews, and African-Americans is considered 'racist', filmmakers have decided to bash Arabs and Muslims, the one one ethnicity and religion it is still perfectly fine to smear with stereotypes and bigotry. If you enjoy seeing how racist films, then this is for you. If Paramount had put even ONE Arab in the movie that wasn't a bloodthirsty religious fanatic, then I might be a little kinder. ADC was right. This is offensive and racist."
2,NOT ONE OF THE BEST !,"A VERY GOOD OPENING SEQUENCE MAKES YOU THINK YOUR IN FOR A VERY GOOD FILM BUT A VERY BAD STORY LINE SOON PUTS END TO THAT,THE COURT ROOM SCENES DON'T GO INTO ENOUGH DETAIL A VERY BAD FILM FOR SUCH A GREAT CAST SAVE YOUR MONEY"
3,"The real take on ""JAG""","I liked this movie more than most critics. Tommy Lee Jones' performance was good and Samuel L. Jackson did a good job portraying a military officer caught up in a political mess. Its not a ""great"" film but it is very entertaining."
3,Tough call to make...,"I liked this movie and I didn't like this movie. It's a very interesting story, but at times you have to suspend belief. The action is great, but there could be more. The acting is very good, as you would expect from these two actors, but it could have been better...Basically this movie could have been more than it was. If you're a Sam Jackson/Tommy Lee Jones fan then you should have this in your collection..they bring out the best in each other.The courtroom scenes just didn't work in my opinion...if you're into that kind of thing pickup A few Good Men...The movie is very watchable and it is in my collection, but it's not at the top of the shelf...best way I can put it."
3,"Great Possibilities, Poor Ending","Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson make a great team, and the storyline has great possibilities, but they're all ""left by the side of the road"" because the ending has no 'punch', no force. For the last five or so minutes of the film, the viewer is disappointed repeatedly when the expected retribution(get 'em back) is unrealized, and a mushy, ending is served up for the viewer to mull over. ""The Tape"" is never ""found"" by the defending attorney(Tommy Lee Jones), and the hero(Samuel L. Jackson)is neither vindicated on screen nor found guilty of the main charge of murder. Go figure. What a great and thrilling movie it could have been. I had expected better from James Webb, whose previous work( eg., Fields of Fire, The Emperor's General) is well drawn and executed, making for engrossing reading.The visuals are very well done, especially the scenes from Vietnam and Yemen."
4,Make that 4.5 stars,"I avoided this movie at the theaters thinking it was just another military movie that would likely bore me to tears. Then, after hearing all of the great reviews, I decided to see if I'd missed anything. Well, I discovered I had. This is a very good film.The action in the beginning was excellent. The character development and storyline were much better than I had hoped. And, I groaned at the thought of having to sit through court room scenes since they can be boring. Not so here. The court room scenes added to the tension and were of an appropriate length. And the performance of both Samuel Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones, were top-notch.I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in a darned good, thought-provoking story."
4,PERSPECTIVES,"The directorial career of William Friedkin is very peculiar. After FRENCH CONNECTION and THE EXORCIST, he was one of the kings of Hollywood; 15 years later, he was directing cheap horror movies. So one can consider his last movie RULES OF ENGAGEMENT as a kind of resurrection. I'm personally glad with this come-back, William Friedkin being a first-class action movie director.RULES OF ENGAGEMENT is an excellent movie you can rent with the eyes wide shut and believe me, it's pretty rare nowadays. The movie will please the courtroom movie fan as well as the war movie buff. If you are looking for acting performances, Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Kingsley play here multidimensional characters and even the suspense fan is going to like the way William Friedkin plays with the nerves and the sense of observation of the audience.Images and sound are perfect and the featurettes are, for once, interesting and instructive.A surprisingly good DVD."
1,Tripe,"I personally felt soiled by this outragous piece of jingoistic propoganda. The plot concerns an American Marine who is put on trial for allegedly shooting at civilians in an Embassy Siege.Our intrepid hero calls on the services of an old Vietnam War buddy to defend him against a conspiracy of politicians and military sell outs who want a conviction to improve Americas reputation.In the end out hero is vindicated and it is shown that the various women and children who were killed, were in fact armed adversaries who deserved death.The films images and plot reminds one of a Nazi propoganda film rather than the normal US adventure style movie. Although made prior to September 11th the images of Arabs is designed to inspire hate and fear. This is truly a revolting film"
1,"""Worst Movie Ever Made?""","They do not allow you to give 0 stars? Well they should. This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. And I do not like that Samuel L Jackson even did it!!! And the fact that he is a minority himself; and supposed to be so COOL!!!!!! There is not one redeeming character in the entire movie!! I came across a pile of free, old VHS tapes, and after I watch the movies I donate them. But I was thinking of destroying this one. Although, I still may donate. So another unsuspecting viewer can decide for him or herself."
1,garbage,"A ""heroic"" american saves his country men from oh so ""violent"" ""terrorists"" by massacring them. The american government then tries to scapegoat him because it cares for its image in the arab world (yeah, right). The racist garbage in this film shows the true colors of americans. If they really want to see murderous and barbarian terrorists who want to violently massacre civilians, they only need to look as far as the nearest mirror."
1,The film is hideous spitting at dead Arabs and Vietnamese...,"Americans really managed to make more racist movie than most nazi propaganda works. Glorification of a butchery Vietnamese POW , circus ""trial"" in which American butcher is fined for shooting but not punished for killing. If you support killing ""well armed civilians"" , you probably won' t be supprised by film in which SS troops are crushing resistance in Warsaw Ghetto with flamethrowers and after that Jewish rabin is supporting their act at Nuremberg trial."
1,racist claptrap,"Great movie if you want to see 'wogs' getting shot by good 'ol downhome rootin tootin all american 'heroes'. A load of old tosh if you want historical accuracy or a reasoned balanced view of the world outside the US borders. Oh well, keeps the patriots happy I suppose."
1,a trash,"this ""movie"" is a story of a proud marine commander of United State of America who sweeped of the Yemen savages to protect american citizens... well, what do you expect? one more thing, what makes you more angry is, this ""movie"" doesn't EVEN have a plot!"
2,How was this so bad?,"This movie had two top stars and a pretty good plot, but somehow turned out horrible! It seems like something went wrong in the editing room because this movie is choppy and seems to jump around without and reason or planning. The ending leaves so much to be desired from a movie that promised a lot. Two stars because of good depiction of war, and the fact that I like Samuel Jackson so much. Ive seen a lot of movies recently and this is by far the worst."
5,USMC!,"An excellant film! Why? Because it not only shows what men do under heavy fire, it also shows what they would really do. Not just have it sugar coated for the audience. Looking at the opening part of the movie, one can tell that it is Vietnam. Without words this sets the tone. You can just tell that a battle is going to happen. When it does the images are real. Later on in the film there is another battle taking place and this seems to be one of the most realistic I've ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson plays a Marine in charge of a rescue mission to save an American ambassador. When he orders his men to fire into a crowd containing men, women and children. Jackson is sent to trial. Tommy Lee Jones must some how prove that Jackson and his men had been fired upon from the crowd. A very real story centering around Marines, and a realistic view of war and every other day stuff helps give us a good view of men who risk there lives for others! Great sound and sound effects editing! Grade:B+"
3,guy film,"I agree with the earlier reviews, except to say that if you haven t read them, you don't know until the end of the film that it is missing a climax, and enjoy it more. premise of file makes no sense. still, that is not exactly unusual in movies; what is more irritating is threads that go nowhere. we keep expecting a nifty ""save"" for col. childers, a last minute heroic of some kind, that never happens. at the end , you want to say ""hey, that can't be IT! where's the rest of the movie? (Its in little ""afterword"" sentences written on the screen)."
3,Too many Holes,"I am a fan of both Samuel Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones, however the plot holes seemed to outnumber the bullet holes in this feature which spoiled any enjoyment I received from the excellent background and effects. It always puzzles me when millions of dollars are spent on a movie, and nobody bothers to notice obvious problems with the storyline. How the soldiers who opened fire on the crowd didn't notice whether the Yemenese had firearms or not is beyond me. Don't you have to look at someome to shoot them?"
3,Starts Good.,"The beginning of this movie made me think I was in for something special. The Vietnam sequence was exciting. However, I was quite let down when the trial came. Even with the talents of Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel Jackson, they couldn't pull the weakly written trial scenes out of the mire of boredom. It lacked a lot of information and left me feeling that there was much to be desired. The acting pulled this two star movie up to three stars. But this movie is proof that even with great actors, there is no substitute for good writing and directing. Kind of like a football team with great atheletes and Wade Phillips as head coach. Mildly entertaining. Wathch this movie only if you are an avid Jackson or Jones fan."
2,Bummer!,"I am so dissappointed! This film put my favorite actors together and it didn't live up to its potential. The first half was absolutely lousy, and deserved zero stars. The second half was better, but not enough to redeem this one. Rules of Engagement did not satisfy me. It was corny, unrealistic, predictable, and it lacked intensity. What a waste of a good cast. Its R rating reflects war violence, and some language. Leave this one on the shelf. Let the previews satisfy you, because the movie will only let you down."
5,Great War Drama,"I am so angry that I had to wait until Sunday to see this movie because my mom had a headache and dragged me into Return to Me, which bored me more, and I'm only 13, so everypme has a right to be surprised I understood and liked this. It has great camera looking, and a deep, rich storyline, in which Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones fight the courts about the murders of nearly 90 Iraqis. Highly recommended.* * * * (out of * * * *)"
1,What an artful brainwash!,"Colonel Childers (Samuel Jackson) is ordered to go to US embassy in Yemen together with his marines with a peacekeeping mission where he breaks the rules of engagement and gunnes down around 83 unarmed civilians many of them children and women. The words he used ordering his men to open fire was ""Waste the m.......rs.""In the court he says ""Innocent people probably died. Innocent people always die.""This sentence in my opinion is a superb brainwash that enters your brain and you do not even recognize it. Because he uses the word ""die"" where you may as well use ""kill, slaughter"" etc instead.What happens in the end?Well watch and see.."
2,Don't bother,I am a HUGE fan of Tommy Lee Jones and I only advise you to see this if just seeing him makes you happy. This movie felt like something you would see on TV on those womens channels. It is slow moving with so many unnecessary flashbacks it gets annoying. Looking at the cast you would think it would be great but it simply isn't. It has a week script and the actors even look bored. If you have to see it to get your own opinion go to the library and check it out for free.
3,"Gripping, but flawed","Rules of Engagement is a gripping courtroom thriller that has a lot of plot holes just as soon as you start thinking about all the situations that occurred. It has two things going for it: terrific acting and fine direction from William Friedkin, and both elements are able to withstand the flaws.The film's best parts are in the first half hour, featuring two riveting action sequences, involving the jungle hell of Vietnam and the rescue of the ambassador in Yemen. The rest of the film can't quite match this in intensity, but then again, that only goes to prove that Friedkin can stage an action sequence.The ending is when the film starts to lose steam. No major revelation occurs, the entire trial moves in a straightforward, routine manner, and in the end, it feels anti-climactic, as if though nothing huge was accomplished."
5,It Has It All,"Great actors, excellent acting, intriquing storyline, action, moves at a good pace, keeps you interested, entertains....and the sound quality of this DVD is one of the best. What more could you ask for?"
1,Worst Military Legal Drama Ever,"I am a Captain in the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps. I thought this movie was one of the worst legal dramas ever and even more worse, it took a worthy subject matter and destroyed it. There is no way in HELL that Tommy Lee Jone's would have won that case. Frankly, the only reason we want him to is because eventually we get to ""see"" the missing tape which appears to justify Samuel Jackson's actions. No lawyer would ever start an opening statement by asking forgiveness for being late because he'd been throwing up. And to base your closing arguement on the fact that you and your son would not be alive if the accused had not saved you so he must be found not-guilty is absurd. Rules of Engagement present interesting and comlex issues for todays Judge Advocate and the Commanders he or she serve, but this movie does not come close to exploring this deserving topic. Very disappointing."
1,Look elsewhere,"I recently purchased TV SlideShow Studio and spent many hours creating a presentation that would be shown at my daughter's wedding reception. What I found after the effort was that, despite periodically saving my work -- or so I thought -- NONE of my work was saved.Abacus Publishing's Tech Support, after waiting more than a week after I asked how to get a file to save properly, finally responded -- by noting that the problem was apparently known, and the problem would not appear in the upcoming Version 2 of the product. That, of course, did me no good whatsoever; I paid for a product that does not function properly.There are some very nice features in this product and it offers much promise, particularly given its relatively low cost. But if the presentation cannot be saved, what good does any of this do?Look elsewhere if you're seeking software to put together a presentation of your photographs."
1,Very Buggy!,"I recently purchased and installed TV Slideshow Studio 2.5 ... it was a BIG mistake!Every time I tried to select a transition from the transition screen by double-clicking, the program aborted with a 'memory could not be read' error.When I tried to create a VCD slideshow(NOT a VCD disk), the compression progress screen would abort with an 'Invalid Pointer' error.This program has many nice features, but it's definitely not ready for prime time! Save your money!"
3,"Strike ""Naughty"" From the Title","""Nude"" doesn't exactly apply except for a few breif moments. ""Naughty"" didn't even have a place in the title. If you're into breasts, you'll love this, but if you like more full nudity, spend your money on something else."
3,Ok,"This movie was well made, but is a somewhat poor description of Jim Morrison. If you really want to know about him watch a documentary."
1,The Doors,"I, AGAIN ORDERED THIS PRODUCT TOGETHER WITH ANOTHER DVD AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED EITHER OF THEM. IM VERY DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THE LEAST AS I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM AND OF COURSE I HAVE PAID FOR THE PRODUCTS.I WANT MY MONEY BACK OR TO HAVE THEM RE-POSTED OUT TO ME."
5,A well told story,"I hate wide screen letterbox formatted DVD's. I do not own one, nor do I ever intend on owning one. I did not purchase a 27"" television so I can view 13"" inches of picture. What IS the thinking????"
4,"Good movie, great quality.","While the movie in VHS was very good, the DVD edition flat blew me away. The songs sound terrific and the scenes are crisp and sharp. Excellant choice for your library."
4,Good....But Not Great...,"It's a very watchable movie, but tells little about what made Jim Morrison tick. Scenes where whe are supposed to get an idea of where Jim got his inspiration are VERY vaugue. Also (not to say Jim wasn't interesting enough for a film to focus on him - he was.) It hardly tells anything at all about the rest of the band. I have to admit, I did not know much about this band before seeing The Doors. But the soudtrack and concert scenes were MORE than enough to cinvince me to check out their music and get me hooked! ....A good flick, but I doubt it's any more then semi-ficticious at the least"
3,He should've done more research..,"As a huge fan of The Doors, I was disappointed by some parts of this film. If you like the band or Jim's poetry and you're debating whether to watch this or not, I'd say go ahead and do it. However, I think you'd get a lot more out of reading a book about them instead. The most annoying part of the movie was how Stone kept putting in Doors song quotes in places where it just didn't work. For anyone who isn't familiar with their lyrics, it'd seem like a regular script, but it bothered me to no end when Jim jumps on the car and says, ""I am the lizard king.."" and the, ""Blood is the rose of mysterious union"" part. Val Kilmer is amazing as Jim, though. Fantastic. So the main reason I only gave it three stars was because of the hokey lyric add-ins and the fact that it wasn't a terribly accurate movie."
3,special edition...please,"I know there are a lot of viewers that are The Doors fans who hated this movie because of inaccuracy issues, but this movie, regardless of truths or untruths turned people on to The Doors' music by intensifying a mystique already surrounding Jim Morrison. I'm sure the surviving members didn't complain about the movie when they received ballooned royalty checks from all the new sales of their material. It's all about entertainment and art (and money). Anyway, this DVD gets three stars not because the movie is average but because this special edition doesn't have an anamorphic screen. WHAT A CROCK!! Why did I even bother selling my old version to get this new version for a few unnecessary extra scenes. Thanks a lot ARTISAN."
2,Doors Movie about par with Light My Fire,"The movie has some great entertainment value in the scenes it depicts. Obviously it is over dramatized for visual effect. This alone causes it to be a distortion of the truth. As far as all the reviews saying check out the real Doors videos and books by Ray etc. Please realize Ray as much as Oliver is trying to make a buck.......although he skews things in a more positive light.........his video's books, etc. are a promotional desire to see you purchase. Don't buy this nonsense. Listen to the CD's....and leave it at that - therein lies what is was all about.....and all it is.........the rest is as fictional as fact........all of it.........for commercial reasons."
2,Jumpy,the movie tended to jump around a lot in time periods which to me is very confusing and takes away from the substance.
4,Good movie,"This movie is a very insightful look into the Doors and Jim Morrison's life. However, if you really want an accurate history I would read Riders on the Storm by John Densmore."
2,Bored out of my gourd,"Oliver Stone's and we all know about him, rendition of a quasi biography of an influential 1960's rock band. We are treated to behind the scene understanding of what makes Jim Morrison, Jim Morrison.The movie dragged on and on and on with psychedelic filler. Most of the actors were sleepwalking through the script, especially Meg Ryan and Val Kilmer.Doors - Soundstage Performances"
1,Surprisingly tedious,"The best performance in the film was Kyle McLachlan's Ray Manzarek, even though his part was small. Val Kilmer lacks charisma in his portrayal of the late charismatic singer Jim Morrison. How can a man who is perpetually stoned and wrapped up in his own little world be interesting or charismatic? I found Kilmer's Morrison unlikeable and unwatchable. The Stone/Kilmer Morrison has no redeeming qualities - casually and carelessly hurting everyone in his path with his selfish, hedonistic lifestyle. I actually fast-forwarded through quite a bit of this film because every scene was just ""more of the same""."
3,Sums up everything that's good and bad about the band,"The Bottom Line:Oliver Stone's massive biopic of Jim Morrison is ambitious, by turns fascinating and repellent, engaging and dreadfully dull, effortlessly stylish and maddeningly pretentious, and ultimately hard to recommend--just like The Doors themselves.2.5/4"
3,doors movie,"This movie was pretty good, although it focused way too much on the stoner part ofjim morrison and not on his likeable side. also, it shows the doors recording light my fire, and touch me. it completely skips strange days, waiting for the sun, morrison hotel, and their best album, L.A. Woman. we start to believe that jim morrison was just a drunk and a stoner, and forget about the great music he made."
2,AN INACCURATE POTRAYL OF A ROCK LEGEND FOR SURE!!!,I saw THE DOORS after I had read LIGHT MY FIRE by RAY MANZAREK and I could see why he hated it.The movie THE DOORS focused in my opinion way too much on JIM MORRISON'S self-destructive tendancies not on how the group made thier fantastic music. Don't get me wrong VAL KILMER while he's potraying morrison does the best he can with the inept script his performance besides the music is the only thing that saves this film from being a total disaster and don't get me started on MEG RYAN I thought she definatley was a lame PAM COURISON to say the least. I felt that OLIVER STONE did'nt really research THE DOORS either and it shows so all in all read LIGHT MY FIRE by RAY MANZAREK for the real story not this movie.
2,"Long, Boring, No Focus on Music","The Doors is not the best movie. While the begining of the movie seems to promise something good, and the end of the movie has you walk away with some emotions. After this first hour of this nearly two and half hour movie, it becomes boring.There is hardly any focus on the music. Besides the concerts, events of the movie seem pointless. Their only point seems to show how crazy the singer was. Jim Morrison, the singer and main charater, was just a crazy idiot, and thats not what he was in real life. The last thirty minutes will respark interest, but does not save the movie at all.I would recommend someone to rent this movie, not buy it."
5,The Doors (special edition),"Although I have never agreed with drug use at all, I have always enjoyed the music of Jim Morrison and the Doors. (and many other groups of the 60's and 70's)...I also love the acting ability of Val Kilmer, and he is awesome in this role. The movie is very well made, the music is fantastic, the storyline is wonderful, yet so sad...I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes the Doors..."
2,Bad DVD quality,"The video resolution is very poor, I in fact have to watch the DVD in ""zoomed"" mode in order for it to make it fit the screen."
3,Overlong & indulgent--but Kilmer is brilliant,"This overlong biopic of Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer) is most interesting early on as it details the rise to fame of the Doors. Soon, however, Morrison surrenders himself completely to drugs and the film spirals into a long series of repetitive scenes in which Morrison abuses himself and others. The main reason to watch this film is Kilmer's incredible performance. To impersonate a man whose look and sound are so well-known without descending into characature is a true acting achievement. Unfortnately, writer-director Oliver Stone dotes on Morrison's sophomoric paens to death and self-centered spiritual explorations so minutely that he often comes across as an unquestioning syncophant. The greatest narrative achievement of the film is showing how such a self-destructive person can maintain a career--at least for a while--through the efforts of those around him who feel that the talent he offers justifies the garbage they have to put up with."
2,The Boors,"I should preface this by stating I really do NOT like Oliver Stone movies (other than Natural Born Killers), for some reason I feel very disconnected to them. And he does it again with the Doors. On the recommendation of my son I watched this on a borrow and I have to say I watched the entire run of the movie and still know NOTHING about THE DOORS. The movie is instead filled with psychedelic filler of the highest order and Jim Morrison comes off as nothing more than a sullen drunken crybaby.All the relationships seemed forced and nothing about this era or group seemed interesting at all, and I have to think that's simply not true in real life. A lot has been made of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison and for all the hype I've heard I can say I was mildly let down, which could be more a fault of the script since NO ONE not even the lead had any type of depth or worthwhile backstory, so what more can an actor do? I actually thought Meg Ryan was the stand out, and that doesn't say a lot."
3,Fiction Not Fact,For a director who tries to show Jim Morrison as a poet who turned to philosophy and music to discover the truth about himself I have to say I am dissappointed because Oliver Stone created a drunk egoistic poser. Jim Morrison was the lizard king not a sex machine.
2,First half hour is ok,"This movie was ok in the beginning. It was somewhat interesting watching him get messed up and stuff but after two hours of the same thing it was just too much. I doubt much of this movie is true. So if you want to see a movie glorifying jim morrisons' drug abuse and ""super deep"" lyrics this is right up your alley."
3,"Snakes, Indians and Witches...","is what this movie should have been titled. Jim Morrison appears drunk and high in 99.9% of the scenes in this movie which I found dissapointing. Val Kilmer does a GREAT job as the Doors frontman. Maybe it's because I grew up in the late 70's, but I didn't really understand Oliver Stone's need to show us what it's like to be on acid and all the while reciting weirdo poetry like Morrison does in this movie...I mean, what's with the indians, snakes, etc? I would have prefered a straight story on the band, this movie is about Jim Morrison. It's an interesting and different movie that's for sure. The dvd menus are cool...like something from the 1960's."
4,An Inaccurate Yet Entertaining History of The Doors,"The Doors is one of music's most enduring rock groups, led by one of the 20th century's most interesting personalities Jim Morrison. The movie, directed by Oliver Stone, is not a biopic, more of an ""homage"" to the life, and the character of Jim Morrison.The movie details his life, and his rise and fall in music, culminating in his death at 27.The DVD features the same features from the earlier Special Edition, including Oliver Stone's commentary. Included are 43 minutes or so of deleted scenes and a couple new featurettes.Highly recommended."
3,Jim without soul!,"Good film from the USA, but this movie can't show the reasons! This film isn't include Jim's soul."
2,It could have been so much better!,"Oliver Stone should really give up making movies about history. I never wanted to see this movie, but when you end up in a video store where you've seen nearly everything...that's about the only way you'd pick this one up.I think Val Kilmer did an alright job, but everyone else seemed to be portraying some cartoon of who they thought the people were.I am a Doors fan from childhood (had a lot of older brothers), so I wish the movie hadn't been made because people that don't care about Jim Morrison's memory will just believe that's how it really happened. For those of us who care, we only need to hear the music.Watch the movie, but realize their life wasn't about drugs and getting out of control. That was a consequence of Fame."
4,Pretty good!,"I love the Doors especcially Jim Morrison, and if you are a fan like me, watch it. But, just to warn you, don't let these exagerations about Jim take you over. Mr. Morrison was not like Oliver Stone had written about him, and it makes me sick that they make him look like such a bad guy, when in reality, most of that didn't happen. But, Val Kilmer was the best choice the play Jim Morrison, and all together, the movie was GREAT!!!"
3,Entertaining as a movie but hardly factual.,"Oliver Stone has a creative imagination and uses it well in this biography of the legendary '60's rock band ""The Doors"". Unfortunately, Stone forgets that most of the people portrayed in this movie are still very much alive and have a much better memory than he does! The music is fantastic, Val Kilmer is pretty good as the legendary Jim Morrison (a little too pretty maybe as Morrison always looked a little rough around the edges!) but I hope nobody leaves this movie thinking this is how it was. Buy ""The Doors: VH1 Storytellers"" to get a hint of what this band was about!"
4,a mystical shine to the film,"The life of misunderstood rock star/poet Jim Morrison is delivered through a hazy 1960's filter and the remaining Doors given the sketchiest of treatment. A movie worth seeing if only to hear the timeless music and feel traces of the the free tumultuous time. Though little insight is given into Morrison (he is lightly shaded as an obnoxious drunk, musing poet, charming wit and lost soul) there is a mystical shine to the film. Val Kilmer is an astonishing doppelganger of Morrison."
4,Entertaining But Not 100% Accurate,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. It had its ups and downs, but it's still entertaining. It gives us the history of Jim Morrison and the Doors. But it's not exactly true the whole way. Would still recommend."
2,Did I get the right DVD? Aspect Ratio problem,I wonder if something is wrong with my DVD player... it seems this film wasn't encoded as anamorphic (to fill my widescreen TV like all other films) but they burned the letterbox onto a 4:3 encode. So I see the picture surrounded by black.Also the soundtrack sounds flat... I read somewhere that you have to enable a 5.1 track but I haven't found that option.I picked this up at a flea sale eager to relive my first experience with this film in a proper theatre many years ago... so far no love! I wonder if I got a non-special edition disc in a special edition box.
2,The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack,"I have watched other Oliver Stone movies before and liked them. I don't know what he or anyone else was thinking when they made this movie. It was a mess. Maybe I need to be drunk or stoned to appreciate it.This movie was very poorly written. I agree with an earlier reviewer that it makes Jim Morrison look like a drunken jerk. It was either way too long or way too slow. Either way, it did not hold my interest. Meg Ryan was a doll in other movies of hers. But in here? She just could not live up to the material. She was definitely a poor casting choice in this movie.If you like The Doors, I am sure that there are better choices out there than this garbage."
4,A visual and aural feast...,"This movie is driven by the psychedelic music of the Doors. In many of the concert scenes, the music is visually translated into colors and motion. The movie itself is more about Jim Morrison himself than the Doors however. When broadly displayed like this, Morrison's contempt for the order of society is obvious. Val Kilmer should've been given better parts after this movie because his performance is the best of his film career."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"For anyone who is interested in seeing this movie, you would be better off reading any of the books out there on the Doors, or listening to their music. Your money would be better spent that way instead on this movie. This movie was inaccurate and poorly made. Oliver Stone, even though he had help from the remaining members of the Doors and other people who knew Jim Morrison, didn't know what the truth was even if it bit him in the behind. Jim himself is probably rolling in his grave because of this movie and how he was portrayed as a stoned, drunk, abusive jerk who couldn't keep his pants zipped, even though he was talented and highly intelligent. That part, obviously, was forgotten. I personally hope that Mr. Stone is proud of himself for accomplishing that feat.In conclusion, this movie is an insult to Doors fans, the remaining members of the Doors and those who knew them, but most importantly, to James Douglas Morrison."
2,Bad,"I know Oliver Stone has won 2 Oscars for his screenwriting...but that doesn't alter my opinion that he is one of the worst screenwriters going. This movie confirms that fact as much as anything. Norman Mailer in VANITY FAIR called this ""one of the all-time bad movies."" And Val Kilmer carries himself like a handsome guy, but his face actually isn't that handsome. Jim Morrison was a really handsome guy. They needed someone with Morrison's looks and charisma to play the lead. Kilmer does have the mannerisms and voice down, but it's not enough. I didn't give it one star, only because the music is so great to listen to."
3,special edition...please,"I know there are a lot of viewers that are The Doors fans who hated this movie because of inaccuracy issues, but this movie, regardless of truths or untruths, turned people on to The Doors' music by intensifying a mystique already surrounding Jim Morrison. I'm sure the surviving members didn't complain about the movie when they received ballooned royalty checks from all the new sales of their material. It's all about entertainment and art (and money). Anyway, this DVD gets three stars not because the movie is average but because this special edition doesn't have an anamorphic screen. WHAT A CROCK!! Why did I even bother selling my old version to get this new version for a few unnecessary extra scenes. Thanks a lot ARTISAN."
3,Immaculately done!,"I for one am a huge fan of The Doors.I thought it portrayed Jim in the first half of the movie then it took a down turn.I think the last half was reflecting his bad side which is why it didnt gain much publicity.All in all i truely recommend viewers to watch it, even if youve heard of the Doors but havent got a good idea on who they were.This movie will help you."
3,Opening The Doors,"This film does more than scratch the surface regarding the band The Doors. However, it is far from comprehensive. The fact that some fiction was applied to the film was a bit disappointing. The heavy focus on Jim Morrison caused the other band members to be distant. It is essential viewing for any true Doors fan, but I have found books on this subject to be more informative. The film is reasonably entertaining, and the special edition interviews are good viewing.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
3,Oliver Stone,"This hasn't aged well since I first saw it in like 1997 in high school. Oliver Stone directs this power film starring Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison, front man singer for rock group The Doors. The main thing here is the rock star excess of jim Morrison played well by Kilmer. The rest of the band takes a back sit in this cool chiller about Jim Morrison who rocked the late 60s and early 70s. The Doors' music is no longer shocking after living through the rise of black metal and the punk revival. I would recommend it to anyone, though a masterpiece it's not any more. I still enjoy Doors' music reissues on CD."
3,good but not the real story,"the movie was somewhat true ... the fact that morrison had a lot of troubles but it was not entirely correct. Alot of important facts about the doors were left out.. such as how jim and pam met and so on. HOWEVER it was entertaining for the fact it was about us. It really did let me down in a lot of areas but thats hollywood!Anyway if you like the doors watch it for the doors...then form your own opinion...thanks, Ray Manzarek"
1,This is it ???,"When I first time heard about this movie, I wanted to see it. 30.12.98 my wish came true, and I saw it. And I have to say I was really disappointed. I don't think Jim was anything like that ( but Val did look like him ), too much naked women, ""John"" didn't look like John, ""Robby"" didn't look like Robby, ""Patricia"" didn't look like Patricia, everything happened too fast, and Jim DIDN'T drink his blood ( read NO ONE HERE GETS OUT ALIVE ).'This one lonely star is from the music."
2,could have been much better,"Oliver Stone, a great director in general, really slacks off in this one! I understand Kilmer as a choice for Morrison but, Meg Ryan as Pam...only in a dream world.All the dates and many facts were either wrong or excluded. Stone even turned to making things up to fill time and help move the story along. All in all a very good story but, not nearly an accurate depiction of Jims' rise and fall"
1,This Is an Inaccurate Movie,"Oliver Stone's portrayal of the Doors and Jim Morrison is extreme and in many cases untrue and exaggerated. He takes the events of the Doors and binds them into cliche rock band problems that never happened. The UCLA film by Jim Morrison was never that extreme, and there were a lot more inaccuracies in the movie. If you want a true account of the Doors, read Light My Fire by Ray Manzarek."
1,A Travesty,"I can only say that this film is, as Manzarek calls it, ""atrocious.""Silly, Hollywood fluff that has Jim Morrison probably rolling over in his grave to this day.There are so many inaccuracies about his character and events in this film, that it's hard to take it seriously. The worst is watching Kilmer strut around 24/7 in some exaggerated, drugged out looking stupor throughout the film. The worst is the way he speaks, as if Morrison were a stoned surfer (""like, dude"").Just an awful, awful film and typical of Stone's directorial decline.Avoid at all costs. Watch the Doors' music DVD's or read the books if you want to learn about or listen to or watch the Doors."
2,Is the Aspect Ratio Correct?,"I picked up this 2 disc 15th anniversary edition (THE ONE WITH THE PURPLE COVER) a couple years ago when it was being blown out new for $6 & just got around to watching it. It's one of those ultra wide & short wide screens, & it seems to me that the tops of people's heads are frequently cut off; I'm wondering if Lions Gate messed up on the aspect ratio during mastering as has happened with a few other films. I no longer have the original version to compare it with, but I strongly suspect this was messed up."
2,"Boo, Hiss - Fake Widescreen","The movie is interesting and I think Val Kilmer did a good job. I rate this so low because Artisan just put big black bars on top and bottom and then calls it widescreen. This is FAKE widescreen and is a bad, bad, bad thing."
1,"""the doors"" HATED IT!","this movie is hogwash. oliver stone blew it with this one.With subject matter as the doors a really good film could have been made. its filled wth inaccurate information ie jim didnt quit film school stone did! the surviving Doors in documentaries state that stone missed the boat, morrison had addictions he also was talented but by the look of this film you would never be able to tell. Val kilmer does look and sound alittle like jim morrison but he never seems to let us want to care anything about him or his art.the movie is a mixed up mess ""IS EVERYBODY IN"" Gee i hope not!"
1,"negative ""one,"" really","be serious: Val Kimler playing Jim Morrison? Oh, be real. Oliver must've been WAY stoned. But instead of being so negative, here's an idea: how 'bout a ""two CD-set"" of...um...say, ""Helter Skelter"" with Pee Wee Herman portraying Charles Manson? And then you could drag out J Lo to play Squeaky Fromme, and keep the ""reality"" in high gear, eh?"
5,Captivating,"This film takes you through the history of the Doors starting in Vanice Beach California where they break through and rise to stardom.Perfectly cast Val Kilmar as Jim Morrison and his girlfriend Meg Ryan take you through the wild, ride of the life of Jim Morrison and his band. Along with the evolving music of his band and the rising drug addiction that influenced the future of his life. It flows through the timeline showing all the true aspects of Jim's poetic personality.Fabulously portrayal of Jim Morrison and very entertaining."
4,"""Out here in the perimeter, there are no stars...""",this movie made a Doors fan of me & the new edition has lots of extras & 5.1 sound. I think Oliver Stone did a wonderful job for the most part with this movie; looks so realistic which I think was one of the great things about this & JFK. Val Kilmer gives the performance of his career & I think the whole cast was great.
2,"It was OK, but...","I have read about a dozen books on The Doors. Needless to say they are one of the GREATEST bands ever to enter the human ear. In fact, I personally, believe they are the GREATEST band ever (Yes, even better than the Beatles), so I'd have to say the movie was not what it should have been. The Doors were art. The movie was not. The movie prefered to concentrate on the (semi-fiction) ""antics"" of a mentally unbalanced Jim Morrison, instead of the poetic side. Also the movie did not live up to it's own title! It's called ""The Doors,"" not ""The life and times of Jim Morrison!"" It should have concentrated on the band more (not to say Jim was not a very interesting person...HE WAS!!!) Anyhow, other than a few lies (ok, more than a few) it's overall an entertaining movie. Watch it for Val Kilmer as Jim (EXCELLENT performance!!), watch it for the WONDERFUL concert scenes, and watch it for the great soundtrack, but don't count on a truthful account of the greatest band EVER!"
1,"Did the Job, now it doesn't.","It's not much to look at, but the trimmer does a great job of cutting ear and nose hairs very close without pulling. I've only used it for a short time but so far I'm happy, and it's far superior to other rotary clippers used in the past.Update after about 6 months of use: Not worth the trouble.It lost it's sharpness and the speed of the cutter often stops or is so slow that it pulls on your hair. Changed batteries multiple times, but it's not a battery problem. I will try to return it."
3,clipper,"63 years old and I have nose hair, product preformed better than I expected, would buy another when needed. Now have a good day"
4,chronicle of one man's growth of faith,"One Hundred Tons of Ice is a chronicle of one man's growth of faith as he witnesses the events of life and nature with an eye to reality and a heart bent to Heaven. It is an inspiring book that will encourage you to see God at work among us in ways previously unnoticed-- new revelations of old gospel truths. At times it challenges the mind, but unfailingly feeds the soul."
3,"Fast paced, but needs work.","It has an exciting pace, the parallel plots unfolds nicely, but beware: 1. Nautical lore is excruciating. I could not visualize much because I don't speak the lingo. 2. Stock characters are very unoriginal. You've seen them before if you've read one mystery in your life. 3. The crimes portrayed in this book are kinda small when you think about it."
5,About the weirdest book around,"I remember the first time I saw a Little Penny commericial - I couldn't change the channel fast enough! That's how much that puppet spooked me! I remember thinking - Nike expects to sell shoes by scaring the heck out of people? Good Luck! I mean, I couldn't even sleep at night thinking Little Penny was under my bed. Some of my friends told me that the commercial tv spots were supposed to be funny and I said, yeah, I guess they are pretty funny...if you're WEIRD. All that aside, I found myself so focused on Little Penny (is he a spirit trapped in a doll? is he a figment of the real Penny Hardaway's imagination? is his skin warm like a persons?) I couldn't help but read this book to look for some answers. All I can say is - that woman who wrote this - Stacy Wall...let's just say, I wouldn't like to see the inside of her head. Move over Dean Koontz, there's a new King in town (and I'm not talking about Stephen King!) I'm talking about Stacy Wall!"
2,L'il Penny is selling sneakers,"I've been a fan of Anfernee Hardaway since his days at Memphis State. IMHO, he is the among the best players in the game today, allbeeit, he has been plagued by injury lately. This book is NOT about Hardaway. It's about some puppet that these Nike guys MADE UP. I don't think Penny had anything to do with it. It's all about selling sneakers. I think Penny should not wear Nikes anyway. My last pair fell apart after like two weeks. Maybe I don't have a sense of humor, but I didn't get this book AT ALL."
3,"Funny, but as Penny would say, ""You missed a free throw""","Stacey did a nice job of writing about the funniness of Little Penny and some funny things about puppets in general, but clearly she doesn't know ""squat"" about basketball. (No offense, ladies, but time on the hardcourt is necessary to understand the ""mind"" of the player).While this book is hilarious, it needs some scenes like this:Penny: Lil' Penny, I am exhausted.Lil Penny: Why?Penny: I was driving the lane for the full 48 last night, then Bigs hit the J to put us in OT!Lil Penny: No way!Penny: 12 more minutes of PT, then I was off to the l-room to ice it. But check out my stats: 12, 12 and 8 trays. Butter!Lil Penny: Ice!Overall, good book, but get some REAL stuff in it, then it would be great. Start by hanging around the court and take it from there."
4,"Great juice, horrible price","My local health food store has these for $6.89 a bottle... $6.89 x 6 is $41.34, cheaper than the $45.84 directly from the manufacturer, and that isn't even counting the insane $25 shipping cost.Now of course, my local health food store probably isn't anywhere near you, but my point is, ordering this product online seems quite pointless, especially factoring in the shipping, unless you live in the middle nowhere. Considering this is direct from the manufacturer themselves, you'd think the price would be something reasonable.As for the juice, it's quite delicious, and I try to have several glasses a week."
5,I Love This Thing,"I used this thing for the first 2 years of grad school and it was excellent. I hauled huge quantities of books and notes around all the time and the thing is like new. And it is really waterproof. When I got a new laptop this year, I ordered the laptop version and I love that too."
4,Great Organization Tool!,"I bought for my wife because she is starting grad school. The bag is made very well and has an easily adjustable strap for comfortable over the shoulder carrying. The key holder is great because, with a purse my wife would search for hours. There is a good amount of storage and many deep pockets that are not exposed to the world. Great bag."
5,Great Bag,"I got the large size at first, and once I realized that it was way too big. The material feels nice and durable. I don't think that I'll get any damage to this unless I do something excessive to it."
2,Not as advertised,"I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i've taken it on, it isn't very comfortable. I got a strap pad, hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists. When i bought the bag it didn't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this, the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy."
5,Buy this bag.,"I have had this bag for a few month's now. I try not to go anywhere without it. The medium is perfect size for books and a laptop. I also use it for an overnight bag filled with clothes, alcohol, and still room for a netbook. Timbuk2 also has some cool accessories to go along with it like a bottle opener or an external pouch that goes on that strap that can hold most electronics."
4,Good for the Symphonies,"This collection has good symphonies that show any beginner what Mozart is about. And it is cheap. And you can find it at certain stores so you may not have to even buy it online. Symphony 40 is close to about the the darkest material Mozart ever wrote. Symphony 38 has some nice wind parts and shows strokes of strength. Symphony 36 is a full-speed dash that is simply put-fun. Symphony 29 is complete on this cd. It is an earlier work and lacks the wind instrument power and strength of the later symphonies but is it comes thru crystal clear on any sound system, just like the other ones. Symphony 41 has a grand and speedy finale that is one of the best renditions I've heard, Scholz is great. However the piano concertos aren't all that great to me. But for a beginner it is a good start. It's a 2 cd set, and it's great for the symphony one."
3,A mixed bag,"This film has some good material mixed with a lot of questionable assertions. It paints with too broad a brush. Much more contributes to our social ills than traumatic birth experiences alone (which, according to the film, means typical in-hospital births). I, and I'll bet you, too, can think of specific counterexamples to their claims that a difficult birth can permanently shape a person's personality and basically mar them for life. There's so much more to the picture - people's upbringing, what they are exposed to in school, their neighborhoods, and other social settings, and so on. Birth *may* be the start of it, but it's certainly not the be-all and end-all, and as another reviewer wrote, humans are far more resilient than this film suggests."
3,The New York Vocalist Remains A New Jack Favorite,"The New York vocalist, and one time member of the Sophisticated Gents (at age 17), Jeff Redd, released his debut, A Quiet Storm, in the year of 1990 on Uptown/MCA records. Though, it didn't cause much noise; Redd displayed a strong, soulful voice and very professional delivery, and had some fairly good new jack songs and romantic ballads. Redd's responeses from late-night radio shows were solid (""Love High"" and ""What Goes Around, Comes Around.""), the only positive thing that was missing was a big hit."
2,Wire Separators,I wasn't very pleased with this product overall. I was expecting some nice alluminum/metal wire separators and instead these are cheap plastic separators. Putting them on isn't the easiest because the bolt tries to fall out whenever you go to put them on. I didn't even bother to leave them on for this reason. I found a parts car and took some of the factory wire separators off of it for my 82' Supra.
1,Melted,"Look great and go on easy, but about a few days after i put them on most of them warped or melted from the valve cover heat which ironically is right where the spark plug wires go on most cars."
2,Highly Disappointed,"Being a Sony fan, I was really excited about what looked to be a great phone at a great price! Sony really let me down w/ this one, I just purchased this phone, disappointment soon followed. It started off great (for the first 5 hours of usage)...Now I can rarely use this phone as it ALWAYS shows ""Scanning Channel""- When that shows in the display, the phone is completely useless both w/ incoming and outgoing calls. I have owned this phone for less than 48 hours--tonight it is going back from where it came. Save yourself some time & money--don't buy this model!"
4,First cordless I have had with good reception,"This is the first cordless phone I have had, where I have had no interference trouble. Other cordless phones I have tried in my apartment consistently disconnected me in mid-conversation. I hear great on this phone (I am hard of hearing) no matter where in the apartment I roam. I hear great on the terrace, which was impossible with other cordless phones I have had. The volume control is a great convenience. My only complaint with this cordless phone is it is somewhat pesky to clear the caller ID list. There are three steps involved. This is my only disappointment. As far as cordless phones go, this is definitely the best one I have had."
2,Unreliable...,"When this phone works, it's fabulous. It allows me to store dozens of phone numbers, any of which it can call with a simple press of the jog dial. It looks good, and provides caller identification. Unfortunately, this phone doesn't work about 30% of the time. All too often, when I pick up the handset to make a call, the screen reads ' CONNECTING' and the phone is dead. Also, sometimes the names and telephone numbers will become go from being represented on the screen by letters and digits to unreadable symbols. All very strange. Thank goodness I have 2 other telphones in my apartment."
3,pineapple print,"The pineapple print was just that, a print. Don't know what I expected but it just wasn't as good quality that I wanted. I have however framed it and it doesn't look bad."
1,Help WHO choose?,"These medications should not be ""chosen"" by the patient. Considering the side effects and withdrawal symptoms associated with all of these medications, they should not be ""chosen"" at all. This book is very misleading and could be very dangerous to the general public. These medications do have their place in society, but only at the discretion of a fully-informed psychiatrist along with his full testing and evaluation of the patient."
1,Alarmingly deficient,"This book is deficient in providing information regarding the well documented and real risks in SSRI antidepressants. It seems little more than a restating of drug company propaganda. It does not adequately discusss the risks of akasthesia, tardive dyskinesia, risk of suicidality, sexual dysfunction, neurotoxicity, and other numerous side effects. The public is ill served by further reassurance that these toxic agents are safe and effective. The book is also deficient in discussing safe, effective alternatives to SSRIS such as St John's Wort, SAM-e, Omega 3 oils, dietary and lifestyle changes, psychotherapy, and spiritual work.Ronald Feintech, Ph.D."
3,Justice - Hears To The Future,"Justice, one of the lesser known masters of drum `n' bass, shows off his stuff with HEARS TO THE FUTURE, a short album that expands his music into new directions, from the downtempo cinematic atmosphere and Arabic singing of ""Two Thousand Moments"" to the pumping house of ""Cycle II."" There's plenty of juiciness to be found here; even the wack MCs of ""Wack MCs"" don't sink the track (though I obviously prefer the instrumental version). The electro vibe of ""Beat Drop"" is pure rhythm, which contrasts to the emotional lyrics of the more layered and musical ""Faith + Reason."" ""Monk Rock"" is a short, looped jazz interlude, but ""Suburbs"" gets us back to the breaks for which Justice was rightly known."
3,"Interesting Movie, Horrible Quality...","Otar Iosseliani is a fascinationg movie director. His earlier movies (made in Georgia) are simply amazing. Beatifully filmed in a mixture of a new wave and neo-realizm styles, unique and touching. Brigands - Chapter VII was filmed after Iosseliani left Georgia from France. It is a work of a mature master who agains draws his inspiration from his beloved Georgia. The only complaint I have is to the quality of the DVD recording. It looks as if the image was transferred from a roor VHS copy. What a shame! Iosseliani deserves better! Just look at how lovingly his earlier works (four movies) have been presented on DVD in both France and the US."
3,They just got too big,"The effect of touring the USA can be seen here. Van Leer openly admits that they were strongly influence by the Amercian taste for over produced Musak and that Focus were diluted by that genre. Having said that, there is still a glimpse of the raw majesty of other albums like Moving Waves and Hamburger Concerto. In retrospect it seems that Hamburger Concerto was the peak and Mother Focus was the beginning of the slide towards the departure of Akkerman and the abortive attempts to carry on without him. The heart rending ""No Hang Ups"" is still played by the ""Jan Akkerman band"" (on their recent tours to the UK in 1987, 19888, 1999 and 2000)and the haunting Focus IV is almost a worthy successor to Focus II and Focus III. Worth the admission price for ""No Hang Ups"" alone (although the version on Akkermans solo album ""10,000 Clowns on a Rainy Day"" is better)."
3,A mixed bag.,"This is not Focus' finest hour. Such claims could be made of Hamburger Concerto or even Focus III. This recording is not without it's merit however. The problem lies in the inconsistency in the compositions. The This Van Leer and Jan Akkerman compositions are up to the standard that one would expect of these two brilliant musicians(Bennie Helder aside). Where the passion and fire in the performances between the two is not as evident as on earlier recordings their efforts are still exceptional. The difficulty lies with the Bert Ruiter compositions. I Need A Bathroom is a blues number with inane lyrics about the need that is made clear in the title. The other Ruiter compositons, Soft Vanilla, Hard Vanilla, Tropic Bird are nothing more than Fuzak. There is one composition by a Paul Stoppelman that is quite good. Overall, it's a good record, not a great one. Still it's worth the purchase but start with Hamburger Concerto (which is now back in print) or Focus III (which is not)."
5,Great,"I'm quite disappointed about the other reviews,we are talking about a remarkable album,very sophisticated,very interesting and after all these years still fresh,I liked it very much then and nowadays"
2,didnt fit,"this shoe was unusually wide for A width, thus I had to return. Returnining is always a pain for me."
2,too wide,"size 10N. LifeStride used to fit, but these seemed to wide for me. Liked them, but returned them because of fit."
4,Great comfortable sandal,"This is my second pair, in as many years. Comfortable, nice hieght and affordable."
3,GOOD LOOKS,"This shoe looks great with various outfits, including shorts, skirts & capris. Not true to size. I ordered a 7W but shoe fits like a medium width. Very rare for LifeStride shoes, most wide widths fit perfectly."
4,Complete and Accessible Textbook,"We recently selected this book for an undergraduate course in reading diagnosis. It covers a variety of assessments, such as oral reading analysis, running records, and phonics. The directions are easy to understand, detailed training models are provided, and blank examiner pages can be photocopied for individual use. The book is also reasonably priced for college students. The book does not get into much theory and research, but it provides practical, hands-on experiences for college students."
5,Overlooked Gem,"Pirandello is best known for his plays, but he wrote some excellent short stories, and also novels, such as this comic masterpiece, It's not as modernist as his plays, but the writing is fast, crisp and witty, with some genuinely intriguing characters. I really enjoyed it, and was glad to have discovered it in this excellent translation."
2,Not funny at all,"I can't agree with the preceding review. We must have read two different books. I read Pscal at fourteen and I found nothing funny in it. All I found was a hardly decent, terribly slow story, told in the usual boring language so dear to Italian novelists (I read it in Italian, by the way... Maybe the translator did Pirandello a great service, who knows?). It is a book that lacks life entirely. Although the story is plausible, there is no oxigen in it. Besides, it repeats pirandello's themes over and over again. OK, we know, according to him it is impossible for a man to know himself and not to have less than ten personalities at a time. We have heard this song over and over again! I mean, Pirandello dissected the same bloody theme for at least a thousands times. Why the hell couldn't he explore other themes and dilemmas as well? That is the chief problem with Italian literature: it bores readers to death."
2,Disappointing Biography,"I just finished listening to the unabridged cd version of this book. I do have to say I was very disappointed. From the beginning and through out the book it seemed the author had it out for James Madison. He definitely laid on the negative more then the positive of this founding father's life. I understand to get a balanced view the bad comes with the good, but this wasn't even close to balanced. IMHO this was written with a bias. I recommend passing on this book. And in my opinion this questions this author's credibility for his other work. I know I won't purchase any of his other books. Such a shame."
3,A Short Biography of His Service,"The author gives a review of Madison's service and Presidency but not a full biography. There is good information on how the political landscape changed during his Presidency and how Madison, the consummate politician navigated through it. The book is not very deep personally (like say an Ambrose book) but does give a good review of Madison's public service."
1,Lame..,Why in a book about Madison does the author feel the need to bring up the Vietnam War?Why in a book about Madison does the author feel the need to bring up how wonderful FDR was?Why in a book about Madison does the author feel the need to bash Republicans on every page while the Federalist come off as Saints descended from heaven.Can you possibly guess what political affiliations this author belongs too???I was jarring on every page to have this idiot pontificating on things that have NOTHING TO DO WITH MADISON!!!!
4,A character,"Garry Wills proposes that James Madison's talents and characteristics that made him a good legislator was what made him a nondescript President. This argument is not really pushed in the book; but instead is more of a pretense, so Wills can write a character analysis of our fourth president. Fortunately, Wills is not only successful in this; but also, inspires further interest in James Madison.Personally, I like this book. It a quick and easy read for anyone just beginning to read about this particular founding father. Wills does not go into great detail or focus on Madison's whole life; instead he creates a good impression of who his man was during his Presidency. Anyone who is already well read on American History or looking for controversy will not find this book satisfying. However, those who are interested in the ""little golden book"" of James Madison, they have found it."
4,Madison's Mediocre Presidency,"This book is written as part of the ""Presidential Series"" and as such the author is sort of obliged to focus on the Madison's Presidency. Over and over again, we are told about Madison's naivete and provincialism. The author is likely correct in calling Madison a feckless and mediocre president, but I think he is anti-Madison.For instance, Wills gives credit to the military leaders for battles won in the War of 1812, whereas lost battles are blamed on Madison, his party and his appointments. Author Wills final conclusions about Madsion seem correct, however. There is alot of scissors and paste in this book. At least 50 instances ofparagraphed quotations from various politicans, diplomats etc. Practically nothing is said about Dolly Madsion or other close friends who may have advised him (except for T. Jefferson)."
3,Mr. Madison's short biography,"Poor Madison. I think he was a good man, but he wasn't a great president, and his personality certainly pales in comparison to some of the other presidents of his time. (My favorite part of this book was actually a Jackson story that wasn't really related to Madison at all, except that he was president at the time - during the Battle of New Orleans, Jackson heard that the mayor of New Orleans was considering surrendering, and he said he'd blow up New Orleans if they did surrender.) However, Wills manages to provide a good overview of Madison's life and presidency. I liked that he was able to admit to some of Madison's failings, as well as his victories - I sometimes feel like biographers get a little biased about their subjects, and Wills obviously didn't do that. While not extremely detailed on many of the major events that Madison was involved with, this is a good summary of Madison's life and presidency."
3,"Adequate, but not Wills' Best","Wills has written a balanced overview of Madison's career, striving to put the presidential years in proper perspective with his earlier legislative career. However, this is not Wills' best effort as he displays an ambivalence regarding Madison throughout the text that leaves readers somewhat unsatisfied."
2,"informative, but seemingly partisan","After reading this book I came away with more information about Madison than I expected, which is a good thing. With that being said, however, I felt as I was reading that the author was not only pointing out some of the failures that Madison had (which were numerous), but also took the opportunity to bash Jefferson as well. It is interesting to see the author praise Madison for his early work (when he was more of a federalist) and then criticize him for nearly everything after he started thinking more like a republican. I don't think the author had to be so critical of Madison to get the point across that Madison was a much better legislature than an executor."
3,"Little President, little book","Garry Willis's biography is a short, brilliant biography of a short and brilliant man. It covers the breadth of his career and conveys a great sense of the man's personality and his place in American history, and at the same time avoids the pitfall of hagiography; it does not hesitate to point out Madison's flaws, and one can read it and come away with a sense of having learned something new, even if one is already familiar with the era. Any reader of early American history will find his time well-spent with Willis's biography."
1,Hardly impartial...,"I'll admit I couldn't stomach finishing this book. I greatly admire Jefferson, and Wills' narrative gives such cursory treatment of Jefferson and Madison's motivations in the context of the events of the day, that it hardly comes across as impartial. Denouncing Jefferson and Madison's principled and active stand against the Alien and Sedition Act, and jumping to a 21st century perspective to offer a defense of the Act - really! And to say that Jefferson and Madison were obsessed with attacking Hamilton, while Hamilton was indifferent or friendly to them? Even a little reading of history would throw that claim into doubt."
5,This is the ultimate self-help book!,"This book changed my life. Through the wisdom of the author, I was able to change my entire attitude about life. Emmet Fox explains how we can replace fear with faith. He also explains the true meaning of faith and how we can use it to let go of negative thoughts and actions. He explains how we create the circumstances of our lives by our thoughts. This book freed me from the ""victim"" mode I was in and taught me to live in peace and harmony. As a result, I have expericed many miracles in my life. I thank God every day for Emment Fox and his teachings."
3,Less scientific,"What made CSI very special in my view was the scientific analysis of the evidence, which is almost absent from this 7th season. Without it, this is just another police and crime series. I keep watching it with pleasure because the stories are good, but something is missing."
5,CSI Seventh Season,"As usual with this series, it's great. I don't always get to watch the series during the regular season, but do always buy it when it goes to DVD. It's laid out nicely and easy to follow."
4,CSI: A Seventh Season Review,"In its seventh season, CSI is as strong in it's story-telling, as it wasin its first season. The stories were original and kept the viewerinterested. The miniature-killer storyline was an especiall good nail-biter. CSI seems to have kept its high standards, unlike other showsthat slowly die out."
5,CSI Series 7,A great thriller..marking another series and more drama in the world of Crime.... After Series 5 this has to be the best series with the Minature Killer dumb-founding even Grissom! Tushay to him as the standard template of Hero vs Villan (Hero winning in the end) really aint everyones kettle of fish. CSI Series 7 is action packed and will keep you guessing till the very last disc...
2,devided rating,"because the series is good as ever. the quality of the jewel cases is lowest quality. when i took out the dvds for the first time, the plastic broke at 50 different spots and was completely destroyed. so 5 stars for the series, 1 star for the casing."
5,As long as Grissom's there. I'm a huge FAN!!!!!!!,"I love all the old seasons, this one is no exception. The cases actually start getting more hard to guess though, I used to be able to call it half way through the show, now it keeps me guessing til the end."
1,Review of Shipping offer not Item,I purchased this item in early December for Christmas. It qualified for the Super Free Shipping deal they were running at the time. It took over three weeks for this item to be shipped. I didn't receive it until Christmas Eve. I will NEVER use Amazon again unless they improve their so called FREE SHIPPING Offers. It was not worth the headache or anxiety that it caused.
1,Amazon Unbox,"This service - although a great idea - BLOWS! It took me over 5 hours to download 4 episodes of CSI. I'm on cable and pay an additional 15 bux a month for the ultra high speed service.I can think of many ways to improve the interface, however right now I'm so frustrated with just trying to download my episodes that I just want to bash my head through the wall.Great idea Amazon - however, needs MUCH improvement!"
2,Review Pai,"Amazon should expose the subtitles languages avaiable in this dvd; I'm aware that it is in english ,considering I'm buying it in a foreign site, but it should be done.Thank you"
5,Trying to capture the glory,"The difference between a Deadhead and any other person is _________ (fill in the blank). From that point, trying to convince someone who isn't ""into the Dead"" that there are many shining moments in the group's history can be tedious and belabored. Bottom line (to any argument to convince) is you need to sit yourself down and listen to the music yourself. This show from 1970 is a prime example of the Dead shining. From the acoustic set into the electric tunes, the show is a great view of the Dead at one of their many peaks (yes, there were many valleys as well). So, as a reviewer, I am biased...I love the Grateful Dead. You, on the other hand, get the discs. Listen. Listen. Listen. Then, enjoy!"
4,Great playing / questionable sound,"I am not a Deadhead, but I believe they were one of the best liverock bands ever. And what other reviews have stated regarding theaccoustic set offered here (disc 1) are true. Fantastic, and presented in STEREO. But BUYERS BEWARE, Discs 2 & 3 are in MONO!And even though the band really cooks throughout the whole set,those MONO discs do detract from the overall listening experience. I don't have any problems with mono recordings, butthere is no BASS here, and the drums are very much in the backround. Rating docked one star for the sound of the 2 electricdiscs, not for lack of the Dead's profuse enthusiasm."
5,one of the best of the Dick's Picks series,"On CD1, the Dead do a gospel song (""Cold Jordan""), which is pretty weird (although not quite as weird as ""Okie from Muskogee"" with the Beach Boys). Marmaduke (John Dawson) from the New Riders joins them on vocals. I don't even like gospel, generally, but I'm very fond of this track.The rest of the acoustic set is also very nice. The electric Dead on CD2 and CD3 is also strong. Good Lovin'/It's a Man's World from CD2/CD3 feature Pigpen, but aren't his best performances, IMO (get the amazing ""Hard to Handle"" from ""Fallout from the Phil Zone"" to hear Pig and the band at their peak).Sound quality is very good."
2,"Nice looking watch, bad strap design","I love this watch. I wore it all the time. But the strap is held onto the watch part by a thin material and two screws. The material ripped and it looks like I have to order a new band. I hesitate to bother ordering a new band however, knowing how bad the design is. Very disappointing considering how attractive the watch is."
1,unfixable broken band,"Christmas gift to husband, band broke in mid February. No one can fix it. To send it back to company costs over half the price of orignial watch. Afraid that the band will just break again,so spending that much to replace it is impractical. Several watch repair and jewelry stores all say they can not repair or replace band because it is held on by two small screws or brads, not like normal or most watch bands. It was too expensive of a watch to last less than two months. However it is beautiful and the time piece, the actual watch, works just fine. There should be some way to replace the band."
1,Editing errors and poor screen captures,"I just purchased XML for Flash and am disappointed in the quality of screen captures and editing in the book. The second sentence in chapter one has an editing error, ""How can you store your data so that is simple to use but also adheres to web standards?"" The screen captures are frequently illegible and practically worthless. I won't purchase another freindofed book until they develop a quality product."
5,"UNA VOZ QUE INSPIRA, GRAN TALENTO, LA MEJOR VOZ DE TODAS","UNA COMPRA DE LA QUE NO ARREPENTIRSE, LEJOS LA MEJOR VOZ, INSPIRACIONAL, REALMENTE SIENTO LO QUE DICE Y ME LLEGA AL ALMA. GRACIAS CHRISTINA AGUILERA POR CANTAR Y POR EXISTIR, ERES LEJOS LA MEJOR, NADIE SE TE PUEDE COMPARAR. MUCHAS GRACIAS X-TINA."
3,Christina Aguilera: My Reflection,"I don't see any reason why fans of the singer wouldn't be thrilled by this release. It's an excellent, high-energy performance, shown here on DVD with terrific audio/video quality, courtesy of Image Entertainment. 3 stars."
3,"Disappointed...still a Christina fan, but couldn't get excited about this one","I thought that this DVD was sort of boring. How boring? Enough to have given it away, since I knew that I wasn't ever going to want to watch it again."
5,BUY THIS DISC NOW!!!,"This disc is FANTASTIC. Buy it NOW. I can't say enough good things about this disc. The video quality is excellent and her voice is as spectacular as it is on her CDs. I've seen many of her live performances, and this one is certainly her BEST. This disc is a MUST for any Christina fan!!!"
2,Christina's poor musicianship,"Usually the reviews that I read here are helpful and true but this is the first time I felt the reviews were completely wrong. Christina's dance troupes are good and musicians have performed well too but Christina's singing isn't good. She has sung out of tune at a few places. I don't think she's at par with Celine Dion or Mariah Carey as I thought earlier. If you have seen the videos of Celine's or Mariah's live performances, you'll know what I'm talking about."
5,One of the Best DVDs. . . . Ever!!,"This is Christina Aguilera's concert which aired on ABC in December 2000. This DVD is amazing! She performs songs off her ""Christina Aguilera"", ""My Kind Of Christmas"", & ""Mi Reflefo"" albums, and some other songs not featured on them. Lil` Bow Wow appeares in 2 songs. Dr. John is featured in a Christmas song and Brian McKnight duets to a Christmas song with Christina. This is probably one of the best concerts. . . .ever! It is full of great songs, NO LIP-SYNCHING, lots of fireworks, hot;cool settings, & CHRISTINA's FABULOUS VOICE! (...)She is amazing & the only other people that can TIE in with her are Jessica Simpson, Mariah Carey, & Whitney Houston. Buy this-it is extraordinary. It also feautures the music video to ""The Christmas Song"" and Spanish music videos of:1) Genio Atrapado (Genie In A Bottle)2) Ven Conmigo (Solamente Tu) (Come On Over Baby)All I Want Is You)3) Por Siepre Tu (I Turn To You)*Take my advise-it is #1!(...)*"
5,Laugh out loud!,"Laugh out loud! This book telling the story of Ellie's late in life third pregnancy, and April's birth, is not only funny, but mirrors the struggles that late in life, unexpected pregnancies can bring! Worth reading!"
1,never recieved item,they sent me the totally wrong item. when i tried to reach them by phone they said i had to email them. so i did. never got a response. their website is horrible. you cant click on any of their contact us links. never never buy from them. very upset!!!
5,"Enjoyable, Educational and Most of All,...Inspirational!","This is a book that I constantly go to for photographic inspiration ever since I purchased it back in 1995. The photos are classic and the words are a pleasure to read for whatever reason you need, be it for pure enjoyment, to learn something or to break from a photographic rut."
4,Jean Redpath in a different light,"I've always enjoyed Ms. Redpath's efforts to showcase the traditional music of the Scots. Here she broadens her frame to include both Scots and others who have ""left the land"" to make their way to Canada. A deep sense of an immigrant's heart is here present, and poignant."
4,Rutherford B. Hayes,I am enjoying the writing skill of Hans L. Trefousse. I read Presidential bios as a hobby. Most bios are very lengthy and dry. This book gives enough information but not too much. It could go into more detail. It has been a quick read for me. I will look for more Presidential Bios. by Hans.
3,He sounds too good to be true,"It seems that every Presidential biographer strives to make his subject out to be the next Washington of Lincoln, implicitly or explicitly. The same is true for this book about Hayes. While Hayes has usually fallen well short of that lofty mark in many assessments, he seems almost to acheive greatness in Trefousse's book. I found myself repeatedly asking if this man could be this good and insightful why isn't he considered one of our best leaders. In short, Hayes seems too good to be true in this slim volume. I was particularly disappointed in the chapter on the 1876 election. The book is a good overview of the issues Hayes faced but it has little depth or analysis. It also has piqued my curiosity to read more and determine if Hayes was, in fact, this good."
5,A Good Introduction,"If the lives and administrations of the U.S. Presidents are an interest of yours, then this series of short biographies is for you. At right around 200 pages, the books in the series give a good introduction to the fascinating men that have held this office.I especially enjoyed reading the author's discussion of the disputed election of 1876, and how it was very similar to what happened in the election of 2000. Even down to the state of Florida being one of the contested states. But in the end, Hayes was the president even without carrying a majority of the popular vote.The books in this series give a great overview of the president and his administration. For some, this will be enough. But for others, there could be enough interest generated for them to read more indepth biographies.Highly recommended"
3,Flawed,"Too many minor factual errors and too much mediocre writing. Obviously, Schlesinger--or any other editor--never saw this work before it was printed."
3,"Flawed, I agree","I enjoyed how Trefousse provided alot of insight into the type of person Hayes was. But, he didn't spend enough time on what the administration was like. Also, the author was very repetitive and seemed to be writing as if his audience would be high schoolers. It seemed a little dumbed down from other titles in this biographical series."
2,Leaves a lot to to be desired,This book does a good job of outlining President Hayes life but it falls short in other areas. It does not give a sense of the country and how Hayes affected it. It suffers from being far too brief and does not even hit all of the highlights in his life. For those who want to get a sense of the president that is about all this can be used for. If you are looking for something that gives you information on the corrupt bargain or the start of the Gilded Age this book falls short.
4,Its not horror...,"I loved this little film but I felt the cover of the DVD didn't do it any justice. I'd rather they have used the original movie poster for the cover as it would have a lot more impact. Yep, the cover makes the DVD out to be a horror film which in truth, it isn't. Its probably a marketing technique to try and convince horror movie fans to buy the disc. Buy it only if you'ver seen it."
2,Not what I anticipated...,"Although the actors' portrayals in this film were well done, the film itself failed to strike a chord in me entirely. I believe that the actual topic of the film was tip-toed around as it took too long to get to the actual story. There was too much socializing and partying going on which abaded the true topic. The ending was extremely poor as it simply states the official outcome of the film's premise rather than take you through the meat of the process which is what would've been the real point to the film. If you really want to see this film I would not recommend purchasing it but rather renting it, if possible. Good day! :)"
3,Requiem movie,"This movie will not offer horror movie thrill or suspense, but is total Drama. I am however glad i ordered it though based on the fact i enjoy the music and dance shown on it. It is in the german language though and can be read in english in the typed version under the picture while viewing. Earl"
5,"Thanks, Camp!","Camp Motion Pictures has done us all a favor by unearthing this strange yet entertaining gem from the awesome 80s. Jon McBride directed and starred in this one, which plays out like a really bizarre sitcom. Even though it's called Woodchipper Massacre, there are not any splatter or bloody scenes. It is full of offbeat humor though and you just GOTTA love that consumer grade vhs camcorder look! At times you almost feel like you're watching someone's home movies. The special features are also great, and they include interviews with the cast and McBride. Pick this up if you are a fan of SOV films or, dare I say it, bad 80s fashion."
2,"old release, incomplete","This release is from 1993, since then the entire TUBE BAR calls have been released, all 105 of them. They can all be purchased in MP3, CD or DVD+CD in the 35th Anniversary collection.MP3:Tube Bar Prank Calls 35th Anniversary Complete Collection [Explicit]CD:Tube Bar Prank Calls 35th Anniversary Complete Collection [Explicit Content]DVD+CD:Tube Bar Prank Calls 35th Anniversary Complete Collection [DVD+CD] Dolby/DTSThis album actually has been re-edited, re-issued and re-mastered in 2013 under the title of:Tube Bar Prank Phone Calls Vol. 1 [Explicit]There is also a 2007 newer version by the BBB's in CD:TUBE BAR"
3,You're nothing but a f***in' bum!,"This CD features the legendary crank phone call tapes made to ""Red"", the owner of The Tube Bar. Some guys with nothing better to do would call up Red and ask him to page someone with a name like ""Al Coholic"" or ""Ben Dover"". As often as not, Red would fall for it, although he would often mispronounce the name they asked for. When Red didn't get fooled, he would go off on a profanity laced tirade on the caller. The callers actually come across as a bit cowardly, because Red would challenge them to meet him and fight, and they would never show up. The CD also features the same guys calling ""Tom"", an Italian grocer, and ""Judy"", a barmaid. These people would also go off on profane tirades against the callers. The crank callers aren't actually funny at all. The humor comes from hearing the obscene tirades that the angry victims go off on. Here is the track listing:1. Tube Bar - Red2. Red's Crapper3. Tom4. Interlude5. Judy6. Red Again"
1,"Great juice, bad price","I buy this stuff every week at Publix. I have seen a ton of health benefits and the high potassium helps keep the water weight down. Also, it is delicious to drink, especially the type with blueberries mixed in.Having said that, I pay $5.15 for a 32 ounce bottle. $5.15. Yes, and with sales tax, I'm sure it's closer to $5.75. Come on, Amazon. This is a friggin' rip off."
1,Unreasonably priced on Amazon,One can buy the same 32 oz Bottle from grocery store for $9.99 thus making a 6 bottle purchase to $59.64 even after paying sales tax it will be much less than $75.36 +shipping. I dont know why would someone buy it from Amazon.
1,rip off,I was getting the Langers fresh pressed pomegranate juice at Rayley's(they recently stop carrying it) for a little over 5 bucks this is 16.67 per bottle...please
1,Pasteurized?,This product description does not say whether this product is pasteurized. Alton Brown on Good Eats says that if pomegranate juice is pasteurized you lose a lot of the antioxidant benefits. I would likely change to more stars if it is not pasteurized.
5,"Laugh, Laugh, Laugh","Once again, Coleman Barks translating Rumi equals a huge blessing in my life.I was thrilled to learn that these stories from ""Mathnawi"" are translations of Rumi's ""Couplets"", teaching stories poetically told. These are stories created to be retold, read aloud, discussed, debated, unfolded, sniffed, thrown in a river and caught several miles downstream with the laughter still gurling forth... as well as the ""a-ha's"" because naturally, with Rumi, humor is a valuable source of personal growth and reflection.This section touched me deeply:""Pay attention to your mean thoughts. That sourness may be a blessing, as an overcast day brings rain for the roses and relief to the dry soil. Don't look so sourly at your sourness. It may be it is carrying what you most deeply need and want. What seems to be keeping you from joy may be what leads you to joy.""""Don't call it a dead branch, call it the live, moist root.""Ahhhh, how I treasure all of the words in ""Delicious Laughter""."
5,what a talent,"I saw Iris a few months ago and she sang ""Our Town"" with just her voice and a guitar. It was amazing and it reminded me of just how good this CD really is. The final cut, ""Higher Ground"" had me of all people walking around the house singing as if I was in a church choir. Her voice twangs and fluctuates between notes effortlessly and is as smooth as cotton. It is a welcomed addition to the likes of Nanci Griffith and Emmylou. Open you heart to this CD."
5,Stop what you're doing right now and order this CD!!!,"If you are looking for honest, unpretensious writing look no further. You won't find any Ooh! Ooh Baby! fluff or any faux- romantic gimmicks in this work. I consider myself a pretty tough guy but I get a lump in my throat everytime I listen."
4,Northern Exposure got me started......,"I first heard ""our town"" at the end of an episode of Northern Exposure and couldn't figure out who was singing or title of the song. I searched for months and finally thought of the net.....long story short I discovered Iris Dement, what a great CD, I just love Our Town, she sings how I wish to remember my town in N.Dak......"
4,Icon,"Iris is an Icon of country music. Her voice is powerful. Her lyrics tormented and true. This is country. Not cross over. Not want to be rock. Country. No sense evaluating each and every song, since they all are forceful reminders of what country meant at one time. A good purchase for any collection."
4,Album review,"I purchased this for my wife, who quite enjoys it. Her favorite is the first song Let The Mystery Be. Mine is Our Town, which I first heard at the end of the last episode of Northern Exposure. You can find a couple of Iris DeMent's performances of the song on the internet, and the Northern Exposure scene."
5,"Iris DeMent's voice is pure ""Americana"" at its best!","Iris DeMent's songs are pure, personal reflections of her humble upbringings presented in an easy listening style with some of the best string music backups I've heard, especially the Dobro (including Jerry Douglas on ""Infamous Angel"")! Her voice is unique, like Dolly, Burl Ives, Rod Stewart, etc., being distinctive and easily recognized. As John Prine attests: ""Iris has a voice I like a whole lot, like one you've heard before-but not really.""The last song on this album is sung by Iris' mother, Flora Mae DeMent, as a salute to her musical inspiration to her children. I love it!"
3,Not as good as I expected.,"Iris Dement has a wonderful voice, but on this CD she does a lot of songs that don't suit her voice at all. Our Town is a great song, as are a few of the others, but overall if I'd heard the CD before buying it I probably wouldn't have."
5,iris's voice,"need i say more? this album is wonderful. our town, let the mystery be - two of the best songs ever written. and higher ground - LOVE it that her mother sings along. joyous."
1,Know what you might be getting,"Iris Dement has an interesting voice but to me the twang seems a bit exaggerated, almost a caricature of an Appalachian accent. It probably passes well enough in the places where she holds concerts and they don't know any better.But what turned me off the most is her harsh criticism of Christianity and clearly hard left politics. If you are a Christian and enjoy listening to someone scoffing at your beliefs then this might be your music. If you are a communist or socialist then this is definitely your music - songs that Trotsky would love.I'm disappointed really. I wanted to like Iris Dement after listening to Our Town but I just couldn't stomach all the progressive drivel in her music."
2,Too Much Twang,"I bought this CD for the song ""Our Town."" While I love that song, and I also like ""Let the Mystery Be"", this CD reminds me of the type of singing they used to do on HeeHaw. Warbly, twangy and overly sentimental. Not my cup of tea at all."
4,excellent album,I really enjoyed this album. I heard it at a friend's house and immediately thought I would like to own a copy. Iris Dement has a distinct and unusual vocal style and the whole album is very mellow and enjoyable.
5,Don't let it pass you by,"Had the great pleasure of hearing Iris Dement live last nite in a concert in a small club here in Bloomington, IN. Her sweet twangy voice coupled with her honest (joltingly at times) lyrics, her calm, and at times very funny stage presence, made for one great evening. If you get the chance to see her perform live near you, get there, now. You won't regret it. Opening for her was Jason Wilbur, a lead guitarist for John Prine, and a talented singer/musician in his own right. A truly magical evening. This CD is wonderful for many reasons, all stated here by others quite succinctly. You spend more then this every week at Starbucks-buy this CD and learn for yourself why her reviews are all so good."
5,Defective Dog,"This guy was actually friends with Johnny and Kamal, and they all recorded calls around the same time. I forget why none of his calls made it to the first CD, but if you had one of the original jerky boys dubbed tapes that swept through colleges and high schools the northeast before they got a record deal, you'll remember a few of these tracks from there.Defective dog is insane! Possibly better than any call Johnny or Kamal ever did, just because it's so mean. That woman must have been fuming for months, maybe years."
1,Crap,do not bother. This is the most talentless blithering dribble I have ever listened to. go to the bus stop and listen to some idiots talk. that's what this is like
2,Shut up!,"After the Jerky Boysfirst albumwas a big success in 1993, every fly-by-night record company released their own CD of crank phone calls. This CD is a case in point. The cover even goes so far as to mimic the artwork and lettering of the Jerky Boysfirst album. The CD itself features a couple of guys making crank phone calls. The main character on the CD, ""John Musacha"", is strikingly similar to the Jerky Boys character ""Frank Rizzo"" (they are angry working men with similar voices). After 13 crank phone calls, the CD ends with several answering machine messages you can theoretically leave on your answering machine, though I doubt that anyone would. Despite the lack of originality displayed here, there are a handful of chuckles on the album."
2,will it ever show up?,i would thoroughly enjoy having replaced this cable from the one my cats chewed to a slow death if it would ever show the eff up. USPS sucks.
1,Poor reproduction,Much of this book was not legible. A poor reproduction. I've since re ordered and received the same title by a different publisher and it is a far superior product.
1,Poor Quality Reproduction,"Apparently, there's been no improvement in the quality since 2007. This has to be the worst reproduction of a book I've ever seen. Half the photos are just dark ink blotches and many of the text pages are overlaid with black vertical lines. Save yourself some grief and choose another publisher for this book. This version should be removed from Amazon's offerings."
3,A Unique and Exotic Experience,"This is one of my favorite films. It's definitely in my top 10 list. I first saw this film in 1998, and it made me want to go to Paris. Just watching this film, you actually feel like you're there in this strange, odd, and artsy underground worldin Paris. The music is dreamy and exotic and so are the strange mix of characters; French, Russian, African. The interwining stories are bizarre and interesting.I've been a fan of Claire Denis ever since I saw this film. She's quite talented and grew up in France and Africa. Her understanding and realistic portrayls of Africans and peoples of the African dispora is refreshing and tres gentil.I would recommend you watch this unique film."
2,and.....?,"This movie was obviously striving for some chic art house feel, but it ended up ignoring plot ties. You sense the director was aiming to have the paths of these characters traverse and have some deeper meaning. however, the movie lacks any real sense of direction. you can admire the acting, but the story can only carry out their abilities so long as it stays interesting...which it didn't. granted, it was based on a true event, which usually benefits a plotline. ultimately, i was bored with the story, the cinematography was bleak, and the overall theme was muddled. not a complete waste of time, but definitely not the first choice on my ""must rent"" list."
2,Built for an adult with chicken legs.,Very small. It felt just right as elbow pads...lol. Tight and constricting. I'm not that big a guy either...180 lbs. Definately not a one size fits all item.
4,lightweight and effective,I bought these pads thinking that the padded areas were very thick but when they arrived they were normal sized and I began to have doubts.That is where I was wrong because with actual usage on the volleyball court the padded areas were extremely effective when contacting the floor area.Beautiful design and fit and I will recommend them.
4,Good product,"I can't see why others have complained about this product. It is well made, easy to install and does the job. I could not find the seperate components for less money with free shipping, well worth a benjamin. For my installation, in the skirt of my 5th wheel trailer, there is a small problem, it is not totally waterproof at the rear, but then it was not designed to be installed in a wet location. A few big globs of Goop fixed the problem and I no longer have to cram the cord into a small box compartment. The instructions were confusing and almost illegible, but if you need instructions for a job like this, get someone else to do it. I would give it 5 stars if it had been waterproof."
4,Nice upgrade,"I installed this mod on my RV a couple of weeks ago. It was very easy and works well though I do have some negative comments:1. The instructions are less then clear as there are at least three ""versions"" of how to install this mod. Mine required the one on the back side of the page, but I still made some alterations2. There are parts and pieces to do all three version - and you have to buy them regardless which inflates the cost of the kit3. The instructions recommend that you use a 2.5"" hole saw - it's too big tho will work but be REAL careful how you drill the attaching screw holes or risk not having enough meat to hold the mod in place. Measure THREE times, cut once (or use a smaller hole saw4. The attaching machine screws are too short and carbon steel. You need at least 1"" stainless steel screws - especially if it's for a boat and even more so in salt water.Do the mod - it's better then dragging a long wire out of a tiny hole, leaving access for --- mice!!"
4,"Very Durable, Adapter Plate Did Not Line Up","This kit was easy to install and so far is very durable. I like the standard Twist-Lock style plug. The ""Mouse Hole"" that it replaced on my trailer had a bolt hole pattern that did not match the adapter plate. Not a big deal, just drilled some new holes and it worked great, just wanted to let people know, I was caught off guard by it."
2,You can sleep on this one,"This is definitely Masta Ace's worst album so far. I was extremely disappointed when I bought Sittin' on chrome because I know that this mc has a huge potential and I was expecting something more than a below average album from him. What really is a turn off is that the production on almost all the tracks is wack and uninspired. Even if Ace is still nice on the mic, this effort is far from his most achieved works and a feeling of mediocrity is present throughout the album listening. I would strongly advice you to sleep on this album and to purchase instead Masta Ace's Slaughtahouse. This record is a true hip hop classic and it shows Ace at his best."
4,Very good CD with a few classics,"This CD has a few great songs on it, and the rest is mostly good. The INC Ride, Sittin on Chrome, Born to Roll, and many others are great tracks. Unfortunately someone jacked this CD from me a couple months ago but I'm probably gonna buy another copy soon. That's how good it is!"
2,limited history,"I expected this book to be more about the Osage people and not so much about the white settlers of Pawhuska, OK."
3,Intruiging,"This album is really hard to classify-it sounds VERY dated, a real relic of the late 70s. Contrast this with how far-ahead-of-their-time tracks on the band's 1974 release ""Sheet Music"" sound.Yet, there is something intriguing about this batch of downbeat, mysterious tunes. Lots of wounded stories told here. Those who delighted in the earlier albums, particularly the eccentric contributions of Godley and Creme, may not be too pleased with these selections, with their often MOR stylings. Though, these tracks still have an insidious quality to them. Best for hardcore completists. Others, beware."
1,Stinks,"I don't usually write reviews, although I use them constantly to decide what items to buy. That is why I purchased this perfume without knowing how it smelled. All the reviews talked about how wonderful it smelled and the glowing compliments they received when they wore it. That was not my experience. I wore this perfume twice. The first time I thought maybe it was just me and it didn't really smell as bad as I thought. So, I wore it the second time and ended up having to wash my arms to get the smell off. I don't know if this has been anyone else's experience, but I wanted people to know before they purchase this item that not everyone likes it. It smells like someone who has worked out and sweated really hard and then tried to cover it up with dime store cologne."
1,PEEE YOUUUU,who would know if this stuff works... it stinks so bad you have to shower before it has a chance.
4,I've been hunting for this childhood favorite for ten years,"I recall really enjoying this book as a young adult, but all I could remember about it was the cover illustration, basics of the plot -- a girl stricken by polio for whom her parents buy a recovering racehorse -- and the back flap copy: ""There he stood, tall and proud, like a king on a hill."" For ten years I have been hunting for this book under the title of ""King on a Hill""! Terrific story of perseverance, of both the girl's struggle with her affliction, and of the petrified parents, to whom most of the well-horse care falls until the girl can perform the tasks herself. Ably accompanied by an estimable equestrian artist with pen-and-ink illustrations. Ultimate heroic ending!"
2,Works but is too rigid,"This cable works fine. I love the Neutrik silent plug. But the cable itself is too rigid and too short to be practical for the typical performance. What were they thinking? If you want a flexible cable, this cable is not for you. I gave mine away and made my own."
2,"Probably my fault, but what the heck....","Well, I was looking for a book to help me out with Freehand 9, not to mention how to incorporate it with Flash. This was not the best of books. No offense, if you're a print person, then this will be a good book to have. If you work on web and multimedia, then this book is not what you're looking for. It's well written, but not much help to what I was looking for."
3,Comprender mejor Freehand,"un libro impresindible para aprender a utilizar todas esas herramientas de freehand que no saltan a la vista con solo utilizarlas. Pero que sin embargo posee ejemplos demasiado basicos y simples de diagramacion que no muestra el real potencial de Freehand, pues lo hace ver muy infantil e impractico.Tambien necesitaria tener mas informacion sobre el trabajo de freehand con las impresoras postscripts, e imprenta en general.En definitiva un gran libro para partir, pero uno malo si lo que se necesita es aprender nuevas tecnicas o trabajos mas profesionales."
1,A Manual by any other name,"This uninspired book left me floundering around looking for something worth remembering or retaining. Fortunately, I also picked up a copy of the Visual Quickkstart book on Freehand, which is an excellent book. Avoid this thing like the plague"
3,"Decent overview of important queer items, but...","This enormous tome is a fairly good basic reference for people who are unaware of many items within queer culture or queer history; however, if you're craving an in-depth look at any of the subjects contained therein, you'll need to find another book.What this encyclopedia does is to very briefly cover a huge list of popular and obscure names, events, organizations, movements, et cetera that have been in some way important to queer culture/history/et cetera. There are many (black & white) photos, great quotes, and fascinating tidbits of trivia, and although I did not read it cover-to-cover, I received quite an education.It's a standard encyclopedia format, which doesn't lend itself well to sitting down and reading through; however, it's great for randomly looking stuff up, flipping through, or specifically seeking something out."
1,Alternate history is a better category.,"Poorly researched and written. Sources are poor, and in all, a dismal book."
4,Quite Good,"This is the first novel that I have read by this author, and I have to say that it is pretty darn good!! The suspense in this book is plenty, and it really keeps you guessing what is going to happen next with the characters. I have found that I have become somewhat concerned for the characters in this book, this is how real the author makes it sound. Excellent book to read on those cold nights with the fire roaring."
2,Disappointed,"I agree with the Publishers Weekly review: The novel is, as expected, long on details of firefighting and its incipient hazards, though there is little mention of the real and enduring conflicts between the investigative arm of firefighters and law enforcement.I am disappointed in the book. It appears that Mr. Emerson took advantage of the 9/11 tragedy to incorporate some of the aspects of 9/11 into his complicated plot."
3,A little disappointing,"John Finney, the main character in Vertical Burn, is rather flat. The plot plodded along at a pace that barely kept me interested. I probably wouldn't have finished it if not for the fact that I'm a loyal Emerson fan. The book's highly detailed accounts of firefighting were obviously written by a pro in the field, but this was done at the expense of the phenomenal storytelling Emerson is so capable of. I wanted to get lost between the pages like I've done so many times with Thomas Black and Mac Fontana. This didn't even come close to happening as I read Vertical Burn."
5,Great!,As always...Earl Emerson wrote another mystery with finesse.Can hardly wait for the next novel.
5,I loved this gun,Im not a competitor or anything so I only use this gun for target practice i.e. shooting cans or targets. It's pretty powerful for a pistol. I love the laser and the flashlight feature however the silencer is useless becasue the sound of this bb gun cannot be muffled. After a while of continuous shooting of this gun It might start to hurt your hands every time you reload because this is a spring powered gun. It comes with glasses which are a nice safety accessory
5,Easy to use,The most important thing I was looking for in a label was ease of use and this product is great. I am a heavy user and the features that are incorporated into this device are extremely useful. I particularly like how the cartridge ribbons are sold everywhere like Staples and Office Depot. Therefore I never have to worry about having to specially order them.
4,Great Labeler,easy to use and the labels are common enough to find in store on island. The price was just right.
4,organized!,"this is a great little printer. i have not tried too many things on it, i am not too technically advanced, but my neighbor figured it out immediately. one thing i did to avoid wasting tape between items is just to string along each title with only a space or two between them and then use scissors to cut them apart afterward. my shoe boxes have never looked so good!"
2,"Works great, but....","Works great, but the leading edge is too long. What I mean is that before the label is printed there is about an inch of wasted label which is good for the manufacturer so that we have to replace tape sooner, but I consider it a waste."
3,flown a foot backwards,"although i love a few songs on this album such as the title song is very soothing and easy to listen to. but after seeing what they did on saturday night fever i figured this would be out of this world, but it was a huge disapointment in that regard, i feel they took a small step backwards on this one, theres nothing wrong with it in whole, but its not near as good as saturday night fever or even main course for that matter.overall: i think i expected way too much from this one, but if you dont have it id say u should still get this one, it is worth it..."
4,The Bee Gees Biggest Studio Album!,"In the difficult position of having to top ""Saturday Night Fever"", the Gibb brothers surpassed themselves and created their biggest hit studio album of their careers, including three more #1 hits, making six #1 hit songs in a row! ""Tragedy"", ""Too Much Heaven"" and ""Love You Inside Out"" were all top hit singles. ""Spirits (Having Flown)"" was a large hit single overseas. All songs are Barry dominated vocals and he is at his falsetto best. However, ""Stop (Think Again)"" is a tad long and a little bit tedious, but the following tracks go right back to their upbeat best! Succeeding in avoiding any dance songs (disco), the Bee Gees out-do themselves. These songs are truly funky ""R & B"" numbers, a solid match for any rythym and blues band. ""Until"", the closing solo track may not be equal to their earlier hit ""Words"", but Barry's voice accompanied by the electronic harpsichord makes for a delicious ending."
3,It's No Main Course.,"This CD is good. But, it will never equal ""Main Course"" or 2 of their non hit producing CD's (Mr. Natural & Life In A Tin Can). More than likely the reason this one was so popular was...The year it was released some rock & roll stations was referring themselves as The Album Rock Station as one of Indy's local station's did. So ""Spirits Having Flown"" album had every song played. The tunes are good. But, just like another reviewer quoted basically, ""Why does Barry have to scream""? Who knows? So if your into a lot of screaming and whining in your music. Then this albums for you!"
5,Bee Gees - Spirits Having Flown,"This is the best album from Bee Gees even after hearing for more than 30 years...Songs like Reaching Out, I'm Satisfied, Stop (Think Again) are all very everlasting songs as Too Much Heaven, Tragedy and Love You Inside Out. It is worth to buy again although I have a local print copy..."
3,"A WarioWare rip-off with a ""hip"" vibe","The Good: 200+ mini games, good sense of style, multiplayer is a plus, downloadable contentThe Bad: Gets old fast, everything feelings like a sample instead of a gameI played Hot PXL back when it came out in Europe and I have to say it felt a lot like Wario Ware but with its own sense of style. While some of the games are more grotesque and leaned toward teens and adults the game is still fun for a while. Some of the mini games range from dialing a number in a certain time to steering clear of a pink pixel for 3 seconds.While these 200 some mini games are fun you can blow through them in one sitting. There is a downloadable content pack available that has an extra 70 mini games or so but these don't last long either. While multiplayer mode is interesting it's over too quick. There really isn't much to say here but to play it. There a bunch of 3 seconds mini-games; go figure. If you're bored with the recent mini-game compilations then pick up Hot PXL."
5,The demo was fun...,I've played the Hot Pixel demo on a PSP and I liked it. It definitely made me want to buy the game and I think it's worth it.
3,Omnivore - Black Smoker,"Omnivore's second album, BLACK SMOKER, tkaes a much different tack than their first. Instead of house, they delve into downtempo jazz, the distillation of which can be heard in title track. But after that moment of jazz, the album gives way to big beat breaks, with the hard hits and scratching of ""Just Keep ****in'"" or ""Showbiz Legend."" But, truth be told, the jazzy bits are great, the breaky bits, not so much. ""Still Hears Voices"" treads a middle ground with the deep beats and a nice melodic line, while ""On Holiday"" wobbles its way into funk. The deepness intensifies with ""Nodzilla,"" which destroys everything with its radioactive stomp, while ""I'd Rather Have You"" tosses in some climbing horns. Not bad, but not too impressive, either."
2,There are Better Forecaster's Out There,"It tells time and the temperature without a problem. However, the forecaster function is always wrong. It will be in the 80's without a cloud in the sky for days, and the clock will be showing rain clouds on the screen."
3,"OK, but....","Nice looking unit, just the right size. But to view max highs and lows requires taking off the battery cover. Resetting the max highs and lows was a pain. If you are not interested in the max min feature, it's OK."
2,Inconsistent storyline,"I read the book after having seen the movie. A book is supposed to give more of an insight into characters and the storyline than the movie can convey, but if a book is based on a movie (not the other way around) I would expect to see some consistency. I have to note one major mistake in the storyline from the book: Both in the book and in the movie, the Terminator tells John and Kate that Kate sent him back, not John, as the future John was dead. However, the book clearly shows the future John Connor sending the Terminator back through time (right in the beginning chapters). Unless there's something I'm missing here, that's a pretty bad blunder. On a positive note, it's still fun to read!"
4,T3 for english,"John Connor, now older, is still a target for killer cyborgs from a possible future. The human resistance of the future has also sent back a Terminator, who saved Connor's life before. John's cyborg assassin, a Terminatrix(T-X), is far more advanced than anything ever seen in previous models. If he doesnt survive, the future of humans is lost. His only hope lies within himself, a girl from his past, and a Terminator(who looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger).I thought it was a good book and helped further explain the movie. It added more detail to the scenes. Its action packed and hard to put down. This novel will be a favorite for any terminator or schwarzenegger fan. While the movie may not be as good as the others, the book is just as good as any."
5,Terminator 3 rocks,This book is the most thrilling and exciting book ever. It has awesome details to show the reader what is happening in the scene combined with an all ready spectacular plot this book is awesome and deserves all the complements it gets.The book tells an awesome story and has amazing events that will keep the reader reading intensly. The movie was also great but I think that reading the book before the movie sort of ruined the ending but all in all it was okay. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes to read and is a fan of the terminator series.An those who like the Governer of California.
3,"Pain to put together, but pretty good quality.","Our son received this for Christmas. My husband was deployed at the time so little `ol me had to put it together by myself. Get it out, read directions, seems simple enough. Um, no. This was the hardest dang thing I've ever had to put together. I used an entire bottle of dish soap and had to stand in a chair with all my weight on the pole to get it in. I ended up having my mother-in-law come over to help get the backboard on. But I will say now that its together it isn't coming apart. My son seems to have a good time with it. He is 2 and can make the baskets on the lowest setting. I have it outside and now the net is falling apart (and my neighbors stupid dog popped the ball). The net we can live without...but I do need to find another ball for it. Overall I think its just ok. But good quality and will last a child for a few years since it does get pretty tall."
5,great hoop,"my son loves this hoop, as well as his two younger sisters! we have it indoors for now and we love it!"
5,perfect,"This was easy to put up, easy to adjust the heighth and the 4 year old loved it. I think this will be around for a long time"
4,Lots of fun but hard to put together,My son loves this hoop and the best part is that it grows along with him. It was difficult to get it together though and it really took a lot of effort to assemble it. It's a great hoop though and seems to be holding up nicely.
4,Simple assembly.,"But... lots of brute force required. No screws really, just shove this part into that part, rinse and repeat. Feels pretty solid, especially when filled w/ water."
1,Water & mold damage to my carpet - watch for leaks!,"Be aware that this stays up and stable because you fill its base with water. I would recommend that you keep it on a hard surface - not carpet! Ours had a small leak which went unnoticed and caused water and mold damage to the carpet and padding underneath the toy. I was even keeping an eye on it (I'm overcautious about stuff like that), but it still got me!One-star review to highlight the issue for future users of the product, and to serve as therapy for myself as I deal with the mess this toy left behind for me."
1,A JOKE to put together!,I have spent over an hour now trying to put this together....I am soooo ready to throw this in the garbage! Not worth the trouble! I don't know who thought this was a good idea but they were wrong!!! I have never had so much trouble putting anything together! I am pretty sure I am not going to be able to put it together so chances are it is going back now!
5,Fun for all ages,"Beware: this is very hard to assemble, but it will all be worth it when you see your kids enjoy this."
3,Basketball,"I like the basketball goal, but I would have thought a real basketball would have been sent. The ball which was sent is very low quality. My 2 year old grandson loves to play ball and will enjoy this item."
4,sturdy & fun,The 3 yr old who plays with this enjoys it immensely. It was a little hard to fit together but very sturdy and can provide fun for an extended period of time due to it's ability to grow with the child.
4,Dylan's basketball goal,Dylan - age 2 - loves this basketball goal. The picture on the box was the only instruction he needed.
5,my son loves it!,I shopped around for a 'grow with me' basketball hoop for my son and this was the best one by far for the quality and cost. We'll have it for years to come . . . it has brought so many smiles to his face!
5,FP I can play basketball,"I did a lot of looking and researching and reading reviews prior to purchasing this and am so glad I did. This was so, so, so easy to put together. Forget about the ball that comes with it, you will definitely want a better ball so you may as well order one if and when you decide to purchase this product. My grandson is only 2 years old and can already made baskets at the lower level. I am pleased that as he grows (probably on up to 7 or 8 years old, he will still be able to use this on the higher levels. Very pricey, but the construction of this products will last for years.The net may have to one day be replaced. We use it indoors and outdoors."
5,Great toy!,"This hoop is well built. My godson (2 1/2) loves it and his older sister (7) likes it too when its adjusted to her height. Solid toy, i think it will last for years."
4,Don't really know yet.....,"waiting to hear from the kids on how the grandkids like it! So far..... nothing bad, but they have been buzy playing with the puppy I also gave them!"
1,I can't put it together!,"This looked so cool on the website, but I can't put it together! It's so frustrating! I tried pushing on the post to get it into the base, hammering it, hitting it with a baseball bat....no luck. I give up."
3,Wish it was made of recycled plastic,"I would feel much better if this large plastic toy was made of recycled plastic. Aside from that, our 4-year-old has a lot of fun with it. The adjustability of the height of the basket is great, as is the ball return. Directions for assembly not great but it's pretty intuitive."
5,High quality,We did our research and this has been a high quality purchase well worth the price. Our son will enjoy this for years to come! Great overall buy. No doubt!
5,My great grandson loves this,It definitely takes two people to put this together. You best read the instructions too. My grandson was looping the basket before it was completely put together he was so excited. He will be 2 in March of this year 2013. He and his friend had as much fun playing in the boxes it came it and literally tore the boxes to pieces. The basketball game was shipped so there were two big boxes. You will not be disappointed at all. We filled the base with water. Once it's too large for the house it probably should be filled with sand for outdoor use.
3,Families on the Fault Line,"This book is in good condition, but there is writing on the pages and the cover looks fairly damaged. Overall, it's useable."
3,A scholarly look at literary romantic literature,"A difficult book to rank as it was not written for the general reader (like myself). Erudite? Absolutely. Witty? In parts. Sustainable interest? Here is where the student of allegory and medieval romantic tradition would probably rate the book a 10, while the laymen will rank it a 3. I compromised with a rating of 6. Definitely worth a look for literary scholars interested in this field of study or Lewis devotees interested in perusing his academic work."
5,Stunning!,"This is an incredible release by Carol. While every song is terrific, a definite standout is her version of Madonna's ""Live To Tell"", which is simply gorgeous!"
4,Same as the more expensive Japaneese release.,"This CD is the same as the much more expensive Japaneese release except for different art work. If you like Van Halen and like to dance, buy this CD. It is a much diferrent take on the original songs. It is one continuous medley of Van Halen songs set to a contemporary dance beat. VERY original! You should give it a try now that you can buy it without it costing you an arm and a leg! Great stuff!"
2,substandard item,I had this product for 5 weeks and it has officially stopped functioning. Trying to get customer assistance from Sunpentown is worse than pulling teeth. I do not recommend this product.
2,sorry excuse for an appliance,"received item damaged and defective. the item clearly looked like it was refurbished. although only the outer box was damaged the interior was filthy and used. it ran for 10 mins and then stopped working. manufacturer did not deny it was refurbished, they just said to send it back for a replacement. very questionable practice. I don't have the time to deal with this type of issue. very disappointed and upset with this low quality ice maker purchase."
1,portable ice maker,"I DO NOT recommend this item to ANYONE! It was sent to me NOT working and now they won't refund my money, they want to send me a new one! No thank you. Company is horrible to deal with and attitude is terrible too! Buyer BEWARE!!!!!!!!!"
4,Beats dashing to the store for Bagged ice!,"This is my first portable icemaker, but it has worked great fo me. Sure, you have to run lemon juice through it at first and toss out the first few batches of ice to avoid poor tasting cubes, but it has performed well up to this point. This icemaker had the best customer satisfaction rating of any of the icemakers in this price range, and I would buy it again. It Makes quality ice fast!"
1,Save your money...,"I purchased this item last year. The first one wasn't even completely assembled. The water leaked out all over the counter and floor. My husband took it apart and the hoses weren't attached. It made ice once and I returned my new unit to Sunpentown for another. That one worked for several months without a problem. Then the ""needs water"" light kept coming on and it would not make ice. I did just read on another site review that if you tip it backwards, sometimes that will help. They should enclose that info in the instructions. I finally gave it away on freecycle. I love the concept of this appliance, but would like to find one that worked without have to do rocket surgery."
1,Supertown IM-100 Portable Ice Maker,"Don't waste your money, please. It did make ice for a few months, noisey and kept me busy unloading it to the freezer, but after a few months, it started making a loud buzzing noise, and getting hot where the motor area was. Then I only would use it if I was nearby, didn't trust it, didn't want a fire. I could turn it off and back on and sometimes the buzzing would stop, but never completely. We finally put it on a dolly and took it outside, where it is getting snowed on, and rained on until it gets taken to the dump. Save your money for a new fridge with ice maker or buy bags of ice for about $2-3 per bag. To ship to somewhere for service too expensive, too heavy, not worth the trouble."
3,Questionable,"I bought this ice maker for my boyfriend's boat for Christmas. It worked for about 30 minutes and kept saying ""add water"" when it was full. I called the customer service line the first few days and got nothing, not even a voice mail. I tried again a few days later and spoke with a very nice customer service rep who is sending a new unit. Seems the freeon or something was inoperable. The exchange process has been easy so far. I hope the new one works better and produces more ice than troubles :)"
1,Very poor quality,The Ice Maker worked for about 3 months and then just quit.The manual is poorly written and incomplete.I recommend you do not buy this unit.
4,thought provoking novel,"The narrator looks back to when she was 12 years old. She's new to the neighborhood and determined to meet everyone in her apartment building. The premise makes sense. Her level of inquisitiveness is wonderful. She knows nothing about autism. With the help of the adults in her life, she attempts to make sense of the autistic 4 year old in the upstairs apartment. While this narrator seems old for her age, I felt this was because she was looking back. I found her forays into the dictionary to be what middle schoolers might do. Thought provoking book. I found the book to contain wonderful passages. I do not have any first-hand experience with 4 year old autistic children so my opinion may be way off. I have recommended this book to teachers of students with ASD."
3,"Good, but not that good!","I was disappointed in my Cobra :-( Initially, was excited; however, found that the system locked up several times. When the signal was lost, it was a long time and several episodes of rebooting to regain the signal. Not very productive when trying to ""find your way"". Returned the unit and reviewing other GPSs for future use."
2,they could of did better,I guess when this album come out they were trying to adjust to the 90's. I only like one song on here. And that song is can he do it like this. THat actually sounds like them . The other songs song like experiments.
4,Best of the post-Godley-and-Creme era,"10cc's first album without two of its original members, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, is a perfectly agreeable effort, if a bit straightforward for longtime fans. ""The Things We Do For Love"" is a memorable single, and the epic ""Feel The Benefit"" recalls the band's previous inclination to totally change styles in the middle of a song. But beyond that, most of the songs are straightforward late 70's pop. There are novelty songs here, like ""Modern Man Blues"", but nothing so bent and memorable as ""Rubber Bullets"" (from the self-titled first album). So, if this is your first 10cc CD, you'll probably find their earlier ones more eccentric, while if you start with the early stuff, the middle of this disc may drag.IMHO, the really neccessary 10cc CD's are this one, ""10cc"", and ""The Original Soundtrack""."
5,Classic Album At A Great Price!,"I ordered this product from Amazon and received it very quickly. The CD sounds excellent, but the CD jewel case was cracked and the hinge was broken. The price was right and the case is easily replaced."
5,Three words: FEEL THE BENEFIT,"The whole album is great but I think ""Feel the Benefit"" is their ""Magnum Opus"" however, my wife's favorite song is ""Modern Man Blues"". Should I be concerned?"
4,Almost every one of the songs has got it own style.,The 2:nd track is the best. The 1:st and the 2:nd track were the hits of this record. The other tracks are mostly very or quite good and for a 10cc collector this album is without any hesitation a must. The extra tracks are ok too.
3,Ok album...but buy Rubber Bullets,Another strong entry in their catalog...wordsmiths that can create a tune and lyrics to bounce your leg and sing along. Wish they would get more credit for their contributions.
5,Karin Herzog Cleansing Mild,"This cleansing milk is light and creamy and leaves your skin soft and clean. No residue, rinses off easily."
2,Beauty that doesn't last,"Watch is very pretty when new, but a few months later the mesh band got discolored and the mirrored border inside the glass started to peel, which resulted in ugly black marks. Never before had I had this kind of experience with Skagen."
2,Skagen could be better,"The watch works fine, but the band is discoloring as fast as two weeks later. It's a pretty watch and a pity watch."
3,Nice little book but....,"It's missing the brain! Considering this is part of a ""Radiology Pocket Atlas Series"" one would think that they would include the brain; after-all those of us using these books would expect it in there. I'd give the book 4 stars because it is quite detailed (minus the missing section) but there's another similar sized/shaped book that has all the body parts including the brain!"
2,DON'T BOTHER,"While I agree, every woodworker can use one of these, this one ain't it. It is NOT all rosewood as the manufacturer would have you believe. Only the face is. The slider is some cheap hardwood poorly stained to resemble rosewood. Again, Crown products are far superior than Footprint's. And in this case, less $$$. Matter of fact, you can get these for about $25 at your local WoodCraft stores. And their brands are cheaper and better quality (all rosewood for one)."
4,Footprint 1877 160200 Rosewood Mortice/Marking Gauge,I've been doing wood working for a number of years and seen the value of using a marking cage. I finally decided to actually go buy one. I've looked at and tried a few and this one had the features I wanted including the double pins. The price was right and have used it now several times and I'm satisfied with its performance.
3,An OK show,"This show gets a thumbs up for one reason, the Japanese match with the great Sasuke and company stealing the show completely. RVD puts on a spotfest, Pit Bull 2 wanders around the ring for 20 (!!!) minutes no selling, and it ends with a big fat DUD. But still despite all its short comings it gets a thumbs up for historical reasons and for the Japanese guys."
2,Barely Watchable,"What Pioneer Entertainment did to the Barely Legal PPV is horrible. They edited out all of the promos and interviews, including the Terry Funk package and even the streamers thrown before the Mic. Pro match. It's a damn shame they edited out all that stuff just to save some money of the VHS tape. As a fan you are better off finding a copy of the original PPV and saving your money."
3,RVD and M-Pro save in a BIG way,"The Michinoku Pro match is freakin' amazing and RVD/Storm is just okay (both guys have had much better), but that's it. The Eliminators' match is a squash with some highspots (not as well done as the MPro), the Douglas/Pitbull match is just too long and boring as hell, Taz/Sabu is a VERY dissapointing match, the 3-Way is too drawn out and there's not much...you know, wrestling, and Funk/Raven is good for Terry's bleeding but it's not really a match. If you're an RVD junkie, go ahead. If you've never seen Japanese lucharesu, go ahead. If you're an ECW mutant you'll love this, but otherwise just don't bother.Oh yeah, and the special features are nil, but the footage quality is surprisingly good."
4,ECW Barely Legal review,"The Eliminators-The Dudley Boys-World Tag Team title match was short but sweet. The RVD-Lance Storm match was not great but pretty good. The Japanese 6 man tag team match was pretty solid for a 6 man tag team match. The Shane Douglas-PitBull#2-TV title match was slow but still a good match to say the least. The Tazz-Sabu match was a solid,back-and-forth match. The Terry Funk-Sandman-Stevie Richards-3 way fight was a hard-hitting,hardcore,nail-biting,heart-stopping,bloody brawl. The Raven-Terry Funk-World title match like the opening match,short but sweet. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10."
2,The one reason not to get this.....,"is that they removed the Sandman music, which was EPIC. If you can watch the original entrance and not get pumped up by the crowd singing in unison then something is wrong with ya ;) This dvd/tape listed here does NOT show you that entrance in its original glory. The fact they edited this ppv...to me....ruined it. What they did by editing this dvd is like peeing ona monalisa painting."
1,Disappointed,"Hmmm, how to start this? I had hoped this would be a ""pop up"" style tent. But no, the assembly was much more than I expected, no doubt hindered by the useless instructions that baffled 2 engineers and a physicist! The item tore in one place during assembly and in a second within 2 minutes of being used for play.We are boxing this puppy up and sending it backDavidIthaca, NY"
4,Popular in Brooklyn,"I had to read this book for school and it was pretty good. The only reason it is popular in Brooklyn is that you can't find this book anywhere else and since over 75 people had to read it for school, and our teacher suggested getting it here, everyone bought it."
4,"Excellent for identification, but not for general information","The book does have an introduction talking about the broad classifications of types of oaks, history of oak usage, historic management of oak forests, etc. But this introduction is short, and then the book gets into the nitty-gritty of identification. Not just red vs. white, but every single documented variant the author found in his extensive research. For all but one of these oaks, the author visited and examined a live specimen himself."
3,Good Musical - Need the Book,Room 77 is a relevant musical addressing teens' issues at school. Looking at encouraging teens to be more genuine as believers / followers of Christ.[...]
4,Not all THAT Bad,"See also the reviews under the IMPORT version of this album. I owned the vinyl album of Azure d'Or for many years and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is more pop oriented and upbeat than the earlier albums and kind of marks the beginning of the decline of Renaissance in my opinion. That said, I sometimes am not in the mood for the more melancholy strains of Renaissance and Azure d'Or fills in quite nicely at those times. People whose devotion to Renaissance is based on the earlier classic-pop works seem most disappointed with the later albums, but IMO a mediocre Renaissance album is far better than some very good works from other artists. I have been without this album for about 5 years, since my turntable broke and was pleased to learn recently that it is on CD. Can't wait for my replacement to show up."
5,Excellent,This is an often underrated release by Renaissance because they have chosen to tighten up the songs to 4 or 5 minutes. Gone are the long orchestrated pieces of earlier releases. But Annie's voice is as good here as it gets. This is now available as a U.S. release
1,BAD,"simply put, this album is terrible. This is not anywhere near the high standard of these guys. Nothing worth anything. Stay Far Far away from this."
3,Cookie cutter prog,"Renaissance (at least this incarnation) sound like early Genesis mixed with Heart. They may appeal to both sides of the fence, incorporating more complex time changes with radio-friendly accessibility, although neither side is completely breached with this lukewarm direction."
2,Disappointed,"The product description implied that it would prevent your lap from heating up when using a laptop. HOwever, it does not do this. It needs some modification, like maybe a layer of foam to keep the surface cool."
5,"Solid, useful product","I've been using the Lapworks Laptop Desk Ultralite for a few weeks now. I have a Macbook Pro that gets ridiculously hot after a while but this product has really helped keep the heat off my lap. The laptop fan doesn't turn on nearly as soon as it did without using it. It's definitely more effective when used in the 'folded' position where there is a space between the computer and your lap. I was surprised to see how rugged this thing is for how light it is. It's even strong enough to use as a tray when I move the laptop. This is especially effective since it has very 'grippy' rubber pads that keep the laptop from sliding off too easily. I've used it to travel, putting it inside my laptop case with my laptop and it took up almost no additional space and added negligible weight. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase and I recommend it highly."
3,Ok - but wouldn't buy it again,"This lapdesk is ok - but I wouldn't buy it again. It is very light weight and easy to use. My main issues with it are that the rim edge is very thin. When wearing shorts and using the laptop on the lapdesk, the plastic edge digs into my legs. My other issue is that it is somewhat flimsy. Resting my hand on the edge when using a mouse with my laptop - the edge bends down. I'm wondering how long it will be before the plastic gets a stress crack. On the plus side it's one of the few lapdesks that is wide enough to use a mouse with the laptop without needed some sort of attachment or addon... I hate the laptop trackpads so always use a wireless mouse with my laptop. I just wish they would redesign with slightly thicker plastic and put a wider rim around the outside edge - then it would be pretty much perfect."
4,Lapworks Ultralite a simple solution for a hot lap.,"This product filled my need, it is very light, folds into a compact shape that fits into a computer case. It separates your lap from a hot computer reasonably well, a small pad place under the Ultralite improves comfort. The desk stand feature makes for more comfortable use of my laptop when I'm using it on a desk or table in a motel.My laser mouse works very well on the provided surface. It is smooth shiny plastic and I thought it could be a problem but that was not the case.The price seemed a little high but, since it is well built and does the job I still feel it is a good value."
3,Intimo men's classic Silk knit tank top,The XXL seemed small as if it was just an XL.Amazon did a good job with packaging and shipping.Overall good quality.
3,Don't expect that silky smooth shine.,"The knit is quite course. If the tag didn't say ""silk"" I would have thought it was satin. Nonetheless, I'll keep it. The price is ok and I bought it just as a pajama top anyways."
3,ok for the price,It was ok for the price since I paid $10 but it did not fit as snug as I hoped and the silk fabric catches and get runs pretty easily. I still prefer microfiber to silk.
4,Very silky and wearble,"I bought this top for my 18 year old son---thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc. It is. He likes wearing it, but he says he would never wear it alone. It is a wee bit too 'feminine' to wear on top. Would I buy another one? I don't know. I think for him, the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile."
4,"Thank you, Carmen Sandiego","I first encountered Mary McCaslin's song ""Way Out West"" while playing Where In the USA is Carmen Sandiego? with my daughter. Her haunting yet hopeful voice and lyrics stuck in my mind. What a delight to find so many fine original songs here as well as outstanding covers of ""Things We Said Today"" and ""Blackbird"". I heartily recommend this disc."
3,informative but creepy,"At the moment my 5 year old daughter is fascinated with the workings of the body - she says she wants to be a surgeon! I got this for her, and it does contains lots of basic and informative information about human anatomy and the systems that run the body. My only complaint, and it is a pretty big one, is that the illustrations actually creep me out. My daughter does not voice this opinion, but she was reserved in her reaction to the book. The illustrations are supposed to look like a child has drawn them with crayon, but they are presented as drawings of the very same girl who narrates the book, but she is missing her face, or her face is part skull, etc. It just struck me as a bit jarring, and I'll be interested to look at other books for the same age group on this topic. Also, the reproductive system is conveniently skipped, which would be of enormous interest to the kids, but force the folks to have a longer bed time story!"
5,The best book of anatomy for children,"This is the absolute best book of anatomy for children. I looked everywhere for a book for my 3 year old daughter, that wasn't too advanced, but at the same time remained interesting. This book would be great for kids up to 8 years old. It explains all aspects of your body such as a discussion of how your skeleton holds up your skin and, at the same time, protects the softer insides of your body. It also discusses your how your muscles work, how your body receives energy from your food, and how your heart, lungs, veins, and arteries all work together. It's a great discussion starter. I really can't say enough about this book... It's just great!"
4,Fun introduction to the human body,"I saw this book in the library and ended up buying a copy. We used it as part of an ongoing series of classes about the human body for kindergartners. It is great for this age group and younger, but probably too babyish for anything beyond kindergarten."
3,Lacking important parts,"I was very hopeful about this book after reading reviews, but I find it lacking very important body parts. It doesn't have anything about the digestive system, which seems a real oversight for children. My 3-year-old is the most interested in where her food goes and why she pees and poops. Why leave that out?"
2,Very Creepy Illustrations,"The text of this book is okay, but the illustrations are very creepy. Each aspect of the body is illustrated on the body of the girl telling the story. It is very odd looking."
1,popcorn was disgusting!,"I was very dissapointed in this product. It was stale, had no cheddar taste, and was just completely unedible. Had to throw it away. Very expensive for something that did not have good quality at all."
2,too expensive,"I'm sorry to vent on the Stylistics, certainly others are guilty of this, but $33 to get all the Stylistics hits is WAY too expensive. Sorry, love the Stylistics, and the Spinners too (whose double CD anthology is around $30 too). Why is something like Lionel Richie and the Commodores 2CD Gold $13.99? Oh well... I'll wait."
5,was hoping for...........,"A little disapointed that songs from a good album back then.Lets put it all together had more than one song too pick from too be one this compilation.And also the (heavy)album had some too.But anything is better than nothing since there is virtually nothing on later reissues from this label on this artist.Which I still too this day don't understand.Their is people out here all over the world who would buy once they know they are available.The albums I mentioned and(you are beautiful).Three that would bring good money too this label.But it does have some not on previous hits albums.So pick it up you will be happy you did.And its good background music when company is over,or at work or in the car.Everyone of all ages and cultures know this music.Its music that will be around forever.Generation too generation.A Legacy,something unfortunately todays music cannot say."
3,Music Lover,"The Stylistics are truly an American classic vocal group, in the best of the best doo-wop and Motown traditions. I grew up slow dragging to most of the tunes on this CD. Like the great Motown recording, behind every great artist was the band; in Detroit it was the Funk Brothers, in Philly it was MFSB. Not to slight the awesome writers, arrangers and producers; I called out the musicians for a reason. Please note there appears to be at least one imposter track on this CD. Although the great Russell Tompkins, Jr. is definitely singing (all of the parts), the music is not the original track. If my memory serves me ""Hurry Up This Way Again"" was not recorded with digital instruments; I don't think they were that prevalent in '82. As this is one of my favorite Stylistic tracks I am disappointed; but there are so many other wonderful tracks (original recordings) on this CD, I leave to you to make the determination."
3,"First CD of 2 great, second less than memorable. Performance is good, songs just not good.","The first CD contains memorable songs, top hits that are quite recognizable. Second CD contains average songs, performed well by a talented group that was one of the tops of its time."
5,Definitely among the ten best CDs ever purchased.,"Even though this is the more expensive, get it because it has the more complete set of songs. I just purchased two more as gifts. If I were told I could only keep ten CDs, this would be among them. the sound is so smooth and relaxing, I can't believe I lived thirty years without it. The Stylistics were quite simply the best."
3,Good DVD but what about the 5.1DD?,"This seems to be a very nice DVD . Only thing is that I can only listen to DVD's in 5.1 Dolby Digital. Sounds to me like you can only get the DVD in stereo or DTS format, kinda [is bad] that way, I was hoping for 5.1. This DVD doesn't get such a high rating from me due to this fact"
3,My Opinion on this Eagles Video,"I like this concert video of the Eagles alot, but only on VHS because the sound quality on my DVD version is poor & whoever heard of having to use a DTS decoder just to watch,and listen to a DVD perfectly,which gets very costly!!! I also am curious why ""Hell Freezes Over"" is the only video that the Eagles put out on DVD? I've thought that they would put out a collection of their classic music videos on DVD & VHS as well!"
2,Deceptive advertising...,I was so excited to order this DVD after putting together my home theater system with a high end DTS (5.1) amplifier and sub-woofer. My high expectations were dashed when upon opening the package I quickly realized I've been had. Not only was there only one song that was on DTS but the particular track was on audio only. I don't mind buying something for as long as it is what I had expected. You made this item appear more than it really is by attaching the DTS label.
3,"More Eagles Stuff , This all you got?","I like this Dvd It was ok , but all that revamp of old songs kinda left me cold . i just wish there was more eagles concert stuff out there i know that the record companies have it & the eagles very popular i wondered why they have'nt yet. if they taped the 30th anniverary tour that would be a killer to see & even the 1976 tour with randy you know one you see on VH-1 the Hotel califorina /seven bridges road that would be awsome to see it. although this in the present somewhat i'd like to see more eagles stuff out in the future please."
5,Eagles - Hell Freezes Over DVD,"This is the best concert DVD I have experienced. The DTS version brings this show to life better than any other concert DVD I own or have seen. I make nearly every guest in my house experience at least a couple of songs. Crisp, clear, defined and smooth channels lure you to crank it up. Of course, I don't want to forget the music, these guys are tremendous artists. Enjoy."
5,Eagles DVD Great x-mas present!!,"I know there are plenty of reviews. But after getting it as a Christmas present, I must say something because I am so impressed with this DVD. I am now very appreciative of two things; 1) the Eagles as musicians; 2) the quality of the DVD, video and sound-wise (DTS!!). With all members playing their own instruments which included 12 string acoustic and classical guitar, and some switching between instruments, I couldn't help but be impressed I took them for granted when they were around in the 70's. Now I am touched with their provocative and thoughtful lyrics and impressed by the high level of their artistry as musicians performing the songs that they themselves wrote. Who does that anymore now? I recommend this DVD to anybody. BTW, it really helps if you have a nice home theater set up with large screen and DTS sound capability."
5,AWESOME!!! Perfect audio!!,"Unfortunately, it was not recorded in an higher quality of imaging, since it was a 1994 show, but the sound.... OWE!!! Awesome!! Perfect!!"
5,Best concert DVD available......without doubt,"If you are thinking about buying a concert DVD this should be your first. I read one bad review about this DVD and that guy must not have true DTS cabability, because the whole concert is in true DTS. Buy it even if you are not a big eagles fan."
2,Mediocre - New views of show based on Felder's Book,"I enjoyed reading Don Felder's book, Heaven and Hell. In this book he described some of the behind the scenes issues of this performance. When he was asked to be a part of this event and of re-joining the Eagles, he did it. When Glenn and Henley came back, there became this huge control thing happening. At once, the equal pay amounts were thrown out the Window. They were all told where exactly to stand. Felder was moved to the extreme right. If you watch this video, you seldom even see Felder. When he is seen, he is the one who is smiling and enjoying it the most as well as Joe Walsh. When Frey Sings he never sings to the audience but moves to the side which makes me gather that he is and was trully uncomfortable with this part of performing. Henley is way too monolithic. Just way to serious. The performances were ok but not relaxed enough. Also, the show starts way to slow...."
2,This DVD Ruined The Eagles for Me,"Ok. I loveD the Eagles. There was a better than 50/50 chance that I had one of their albums in my car. When people hated on them (there are A LOT of Eagles haters out there) I defended them wholeheartedly. NO MORE. The only Eagle I did not despise by the end of the DVD was Joe Walsh, who may be the sweetest old man ever. The only reason this DVD did not get 1 star is that the Eagles are still awesome musicians.The Eagles should be heard (NOT THEIR INTERVIEWS) and not seen.P.S. Timothy B. Schmidt is the worst. I miss Randy Meisner."
2,This isn't DTS,"I was looking forward to this disc until I tried it. While it really is a good quality disc, only one track was recorded in DTS. I don't think it justifies the monicker or the extra expense. Both my player and receiver would display DTS/DD playback. I thought it might be my equipment, so checked the fine print and only the last track, ""Seven Bridges Road,"" is recorded in DTS. The rest wasn't even DD. Ironic that someone could comment on the how others aren't capable of appreciating DD/DTS when he wasn't listening to either."
2,good if your diehard into them,"If you have all their albums, know all their lyrics, then maybe this is for you, but if your like me, and have heard about 5-6 of their radio songs throughout your life, then you might not like their other stuff. I thought this was WAY SLOW! And way boring. ZZZZZzzzzzzz Not only were the songs soppy slow, but the band was too: they sat on chairs! This reminded me of one of the bad bands you see playing in a casino bar lounge at 2:30 am in the morning in Vegas. Don't get me wrong, slow is not always bad, For example, I think fleet wood mack is way better at this genre. This is just sick, bring a pillow"
1,DTS Only??? This STINKS!!!!,"Who is the genius that decided this should only be released in DTS?????? I may not be completely state of the art, but my Dolby Digital system is very nice, and I am not spending hundreds of dollars to upgrade any time soon! This is the only DVD I have come across that I could not listen to in 6 or 2 channel Dolby, my only option here is 2 channel non dolby. Because of this, this disc is worthless to me. I'm glad I only borrowed it, because I will NOT be buying it any time soon. Even the new Don Henley DVD has both DTS ***AND*** Dolby Digital Sound. What would it have hurt to do the same here? This is unbelievably thoughtless!!!!"
3,Not much going on,"Not a particularly ""exciting"" event but worthwhile. They missed many of their better songs in lieu of lesser songs like Pretty Maids or Wasted Time. The Last Resort, also a lesser tune, was actually pretty good. Hotel California was the highlight. I enjoyed Joe Walsh the most in his goofy sort of way, although he wasn't as silly and goofy as I've seen in other events. The whole affair was very subdued with only three songs really rocking; In The City, Life In The Fast Lane and Get Over It. I enjoyed their ""Last Farewell"" DVD more, I would recommend that instead of this one."
5,Worth waiting 14 yrs for...,This is the best musical DVD of all time! Play it on your large screen TV...
5,Video-Eagles-Hell Freezes Over,"Great DVD. Wonderful concert. Wish there was more song,didn't want it to end!!!"
4,Good one to relax,"This is a very good DVD to own - especially if you are an Eagles fan. The DTS recording makes it very good to listen too... and watching all those your favourite stars - Dan, Timothy, Glen and Joe (now turned oldies!) is fun! Especially the pre show documentary is very good. Shows the frustrations because they went rusty in 14 years, and their step by step composing is cool to watch. Well, they could have added some old videos also along with it - just for more fun!Another noticeable flaw is the moment you start playing it, the program starts without any warning with Dan Henley speaking.Other than that, this is a good piece that will stay attractive in your DVD collection! Go for it!"
5,A Must Have,"Absolutely the best DVD I have ever heard or seen. First of all you start with a great band and great songs. Then you combine it with the best production of any DVD and you have a standard that makes other DVD's seem ho-hum. The sound is perfect and demonstrates why DTS is the only way to go. The camera work is fantastic, the up close shots are so clear that you feel you are right on stage and part of the band. The song list is great and the arrangement of Hotel California is classic. If you missed the concert then this is the next best thing and you can play it over and over. Can't wait for their next one."
3,DTS? Give me a break! Where's the Dolby Digital 5.1?,"This is a great concert, with a stellar reproduction of all of the Eagle's greatest songs. DVD is truly amazing in it's video and audio reproductive capabilities. However, there is no reason not to put on a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack along with the DTS, given the capacity of a disc. I would have given 5 stars if they had just been big enough to bow to the majority of DVD owners out there who have to listen to this Eagles concert in PCM stereo mode just because some idiots wanted to make a point about competing formats. The customer loses again."
2,5.1 ADVICE,Be careful when ordering this DVD. It is recorded in either DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1. Make sure your RECEIVER processes DTS otherwise buy the Dolby Digital version. Most all DVD players read and send a DTS & Dolby Digital signal to your receiver but make sure your receiver processes DTS and/or Dolby Digital before you make your decision. I have the DTS version but no DTS processer and had to select the enhanced stereo setting. On the other hand the sound is still impressive. So far no other DVD I've purchased compares in overall quality. I'm convinced this is the best way to enjoy music. I've stopped buying CDs and only buy music DVDs now. I'm waiting for my old classics to be re-mixed to 5.1 sound with some clips from concerts.
3,Eagles Hell Freezes Over,The visual quality wa great but the voice quality was terrible. The instruments overpowered the voices which really takes away the whole effect of the harmonizing of the Eagles. I would not recommend this CD
5,Sensational,"This piece is perfect! I wouldn't change a thing. The ""Eagles"" were just ad they were before. Talented and true ""Artists"".If you love the ""Eagles"" you'll love this Musical Masterpiece.Cindy"
3,Hell freezes over,This video was very old but i found it informative about the band & their reluctance to tour without new material.(Not just another oldies band)
5,Excellent Work lots of favorites,DTS makes a big difference on this DVD if you have the DTS converter. Great sounds really surround you. Much better than the sound of the CD. Hopefully a lot more concerts will be coming out in the DTS format. Would be great for CD's as well
5,Amazing!!!,"Absolutely amazing! One of the best dvd concerts that I have, crystal clear picture and fantastic sound. Acoustic rhapsody!!! So full of emotions, Eagles take you to another dimension. Great voices, great guitar sounds!"
5,great performance,"These guys are so talented. This concert shows what gifted artists they all are. If anything, they are better in this concert (in about '94) than they were before they broke up. The camera work is so good at showing their hands at work on the guitars, and the keyboards and percussion. You would have to be on stage with them to see their talent as well as this dvd shows it. It is a pleasure to see such gifted artists. I have watched it many times."
5,Damn,This is the best of the best. I would like to see another concert by The Eagles. The DTS experience will make you want to convert all of your DVD's to DTS. Spend the money on the equipement to enjoy every ounce of this performance.
5,Smooth soft rock,"I think the Amazon reviewer has it about right. This show doesn't feel like a ""reunion"" or a ""nostalgia"" event at all; it's just a good show, and the boys look like they never stopped playing in the first place. They're in complete control of the material, and all the songs go down smooth. The visuals are good, the sound is good, and Don Henley's self-importance is little more than a minor irritant. If you like the Eagles' music, or if you're like me and can get into most types of music shows, as long as they're good, you'll enjoy this DVD."
2,dvd,"love the eagles but this is a poor quality copy we received, so we went to a store to get a copy"
5,YOU MAKE YOUR OWN HEAVEN AND HELL ON EARTH EVERYDAY,WHAT A PLEASURE TO SEE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND DYSFUNCTIONAL AT THE SAME TIME MUSICAL GIANTS OF ALL TIME. THE SOUND WAS CLEAR ALL THE WAY THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE GUITAR SOLO ON TAKE IT EASY. NICE TO SEE HOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER.
2,DTS not for DVD early adopters,"My AV receiver is about 2 years old. It does not have a DTS decoder. Most of the newer ones do. This DVD is one of the few DVDs in the world (maybe it's up to about 4 or 5 now) that is recorded in DTS and not Dolby Digital also. If you don't have a DTS decoder, all you get is PCM stereo. What's the point of buying a DVD if you can't listen to surround sound? Sure as hell not to see in high resolution all of the wrinkles on Don Henley's face. If you don't have a DTS decoder, don't bother. Buy some of their CDs and get the same audio experince."
3,Not as good as Farewell,I have both DVDs and I disagree with those that say HFO is better I thought it had too many slow songs. Farewell has 3 hours of music and is very well done. No contest! The Eagles are the best why not get more concert for the money.
3,Not a very dramatic music dvd..,"I first saw the Eagles play in concert when I was 16, some many years ago, and paid 98 bucks for the ticket (not a trivial amount for me back then). They arrived late on the stage, but they made up for it, with the beginning riff to 'Hotel California', 'Life in the fast lane', and 'Life is good' by Joe Walsh.This DVD is somewhat of a miss from what I have grown to love about the Eagles. Their performance, with the entire band sitting in chairs while carefully expressing their craft, is a subdued experience of audial heights. I would have liked more life in this performance, not a bunch of old guys acting geriatric.On the other hand, the songs are rendered as only the Eagles can render them. If you are looking for a rollicking performance by one of the greatest bands, then maybe another DVD is more appropriate. But if you are looking for a more serene listen to a classic group, then this DVD might be right for you."
5,AWESOME DVD (dts).... A Must Have!,"I wasn't a huge Eagles fan until now. The first time through, this DVD gave me goose bumps on every cut. The audio is the best I've heard and if you have a dts decoder, you must buy this DVD. There is hardly a day that goes by without me listening to at least a few cuts....I just don't get tired of it. Buy it and enjoy!!"
4,Hell Freezes Over,If you like the Eagles you already know you need this book. Very detailed songs with tabs so you might get busy turning pages as you follow along. Songs in the book are dead on accurate with what you hear on the radio. A must have for the Eagles fan.
3,Untrue to Their Roots,"As good as the production of this set is, I was truly disappointed that so much of their earlier music from the first three albums was omitted. ""Lyin' Eyes"" and ""Take it to the Limit"" were most notable and not a single cut from one of the Eagles' best albums, ""On the Border"", was performed."
5,Great music is forever,"This is a 1994 concert of my favorite group from my old college days (late 70's). They are still great musicians. I also purchased their Farwell Tour from 2005, and both of these are great presentations from great artists. This is real music(not syntesized as so many Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga current performers use)but real guitar, real voices. I think old and young will enjoy the Eagles."
5,Brings back memories,Awesome quality. I purchased this DVD because I lost my original while moving. It looks and sounds great. It shows clips when they meet at the studio and has some interviews with the singers expressing their excitement to be together again. Great concert by the way. Eagles Rock!
5,Timeless harmonies and musical talent abound!,"A great entertaining look at one of the best bands in the land. Overlooked and under appreciated, The Eagles still have all of the great talent to release chills and goose bumps when listening to their music. This video is a great look at how the band brings it all together to put on an outstanding show. You get the appreciation for their hours of rehearsal and attention to detail...the sense that they want to truly put forth their best effort and not settle for some sloppy feable attempt. Old classics are blended with new works, once again show-casing the band's wonderful harmonies. They may not be living life quite as fast as Life in the Fast Lane, but one thing remains for certain: The Eagles' music will go out of style when ""Hell Freezes Over."""
5,can't wait to see it!,I have enjoyed this concert for years on laserdisc. I can't wait to see and hear what DVD does to it. I'm sure it will be spectacular.
5,Another great buy and addition to my collection,"Simply great, sounds very nice with my home theatre speakers with it's dts digital surround. Video quality is superb especially with a use of super video digital cable."
3,"Close, but no cigar","Great songs, great musicianship, terrific production values and sound production, but the band plays as if it is merely turning in a very perfunctory performance.Don't get me wrong. I love the Eagles and have always loved listening to the Hell Freezes Over CD. But this DVD, which features the band's comeback performance for an MTV special, somehow left me cold.The band seems merely to be going through the motions and there is no fire in the gig.It does have its highlights though -- the splendid reworking of Hotel California, Joe Walsh's turn on Pretty Maids All In A Row, the first live performance of the then new song Learn To Stand Still and Timothy B. Schmidt's always-amazing I Can't Tell You Why.On the plus side, the surround soundtrack is among the best you'll find on a music DVD."
5,Hell Freezes over,"I have always been a fan of the Eagles, but never saw them in concert. This DVD provides a wonderful view into where they were and how they created all those great songs. I also was amazed to find out that each one of these guys was so talented. This DVD is worth every penny."
5,Excellent reference disc for DTS audio,"This DVD is my favorite reference disc to show off my DTS audio system. The Eagles have never sounded so good.The program itself is the same one that aired on MTV back in 1994. Image quality in the beginning (behind the scenes interviews) is horrible. I was worried the whole DVD would look this way, but once the concert started, the quality improved dramatically.The audio is the best thing about this disc. The DTS audio track cannot be rivaled by any other DVD I have listened to. The stereo track is decent as well, but I got the disc for the DTS track.There aren't any extras on this disc, except for the interviews in the beginning and a DTS only song.Bottom Line - If you like the Eagles, get this disc. If you have a DTS sound system, get this disc to show what DTS can do."
2,Not a happy camper ...DVD #1 was MISSING,DVD number 1 was no where to be found in the packaging!!! DVD number 2 was very well done. I would have given AT KEAST 4 STARS if the package had contained ALL 10 DVD DISKS!!! I hope that Amazon.com will let me know how to get in touch with rhe merchant (was NOT Amazon) so I can TRY to get DVD number 1 sent to me...
3,Reminiscing,"It's nice to be able to watch the old games, but there are several that should have been included. I would have traded the overtime win against Pittsburgh for the House of Pain Monday night game. The playoff game against the Lions and the 44-6 game against the Cowboys were fun to watch at the time, but I wouldn't put them as top 10 in Eagles history."
1,Customer Service Problems,"My company pruchased this unit 2 months ago. During a Board presentation the projector went down. We determined that it was a bad bulb and that I would get a new one. At first i thought Infocus had great customer service until i was told continuously that I would have a bulb shipped ""next week"". I heard this for two months, calling twice a week. Finally, i asked to talk to the manager when they told me the bulbs were still not in. Miraciously they came up with one. What are the odds of that????? I was getting the run-around. Very suprised by this. I thought they were a reputable company."
3,Pretty Good,"This is a decent mix CD. If you're into the DJ Kicks series, there are certainly better disks to get. But whether you like the Stereo MC's (I don't) or not, this is a fun blend of hip hop beats and silly breaks. Its definitely a party record. Not very well mixed, but again, that's not really the point. If you're looking for a fun, fast paced CD mix of some good hip hop/ big beat, check this out."
4,One of the best in a Great Series.,"This cd has it's faults, it doesn't always flow the way you would like to think a mix should. I have come to reguard this as just another opinion in a very diverse whole of musical styles and influences. Hear the influences are mostly intramental, in a funky groove, uptempo, or in latin time. Drum and bass are thrown in at sparse intervals, rappers appear often enough to make the mix interesting and somewhat enjoyable(I question the inclusion of ""Pharoh Intellect""). You can find fault with the mixing style but for me it didn't get in the way."
1,Yuck Dogs,"These were really awful. After reading the great reviews on the worthing vegetarian hot dogs and meat I was real hopeful, but they were just gross. We do love the morning star veggie dogs though. They taste a lot closer to the real thing. These veggie dogs were very mushy and just broke in half when I tried to take them out of the can. Very disappointing. We are a vegetarian family of 6 and no one would eat them."
4,One of the best veggie hot dogs out there,Worthington Leanies are the best veggies hot dog IMHO. But they aren't widely available. Veja-Links is the next best choice. Pleasant hot dog taste with the right texture. They grill up nice and will get that crusty outside. There are 10 in a can and they are only about 5 inches long so I often use one and a half in bun. Only 50 calories a link. We buy a case at the beginning of summer and eat all them summer long.
5,mmm..mmm..mmm great!,"I have been eating veja-links for over 12 years. I have ate them since I was about 7. They are great, I can no longer eat real hot dogs because they taste gross now. Veja-links have totally ruined them for me and that I am glad! Pop open the can and eat them cold or warm them up (boil, microwave, grill, etc.) I love them on a hot dog bun with ketchup and real mayonaise. It will not disappoint!"
5,vegetarian meat!,"I have been eating vegetarian products for most of my life! For a vegetarian hot dog these really aren't to bad. Taste great mashed and mixed with mayonaise, used as a spread!"
3,Veja - Links mimic real weiners,"Veja-Links taste like real weiners. They are a little softer than a real weiner, but not as soft as Loma Linda Big Franks. Also, they nor real weiners have the savory flavor of Big Franks to me. Some people don't like their veggie dogs soft. For those who want their veggie dog to taste exactly like the real thing, I would reccomend another product from this same company - Morning Star Farms veggie dogs. They're in the frozen breakfast section of your local grocery store. They are firm just like real weiners and they have the exact same taste. However, I prefer Big Franks to both of these veggie dogs."
4,Very good system for the money.,"I bought this to provide sound for my 50W DVD/Receiver. This is my first experience with home theater so I was very careful not to spend to much. So far, it is very good.I have it in a mid-sized living room and the sound is enjoyable. I am satisfied with the price. We can listen to music through-out our house with it.I would buy this again if I was looking for a lower-end starter system. Good results."
4,Very good for small room,"This speaker system, if you already have a good receiver that gives out 100 watts per channel, then these speakers will meet your needs. The 8 inch sub woofer compliments the 4 3-way satellite speakers and the 1 center channel speakers."
3,"Almost Worth the Money, Certainly not a Penny More","I got a $200.00 gift certificate to spend at Amazon.com and needed surround sound speakers, so I bought by price... Now I wasn't expecting Bose quality here, and my expectations were not exceeded. For the money I got a great subwoofer and decent center channel, but the four satellite speakers were pretty weak on sound quality... about the same as having four clock radios around the room. So, my advice? Save up a little more and buy at least the next grade up."
3,Just OK...,"I really like this author, and was somewhat disappointed in this book. It kept my interest, but was lacking on the suspense. Sure, the reader wants to figure out who the killer is, and the clues come slowly, but never once was the hero in any danger himself. A kindly old doctor slowly send him the clues to figure out, but that is about it. Not my favorite, but if you are a fan of Kellerman, give it a try."
3,Okay...,"Here's my review system--I score on four categories and average them together for the number of stars. The four categories are: character development (are the characters deep and complex, plot (is it interesting), voice (is the narration smooth and engaging) and cliche level (is it predictable.)Character development: 5 stars--Kellerman is very good at getting inside the head of his charactersPlot: 4 stars-- It took forever but there was a nice twist or twovoice: 5 stars-- Very easy and pleasant to digestcliche level: 3 stars-- The crazy serial killer and the non cop protagonist has been done a bitand this one didn't bring a whole lot that is newI like psychological thrillers and this one was pretty good."
2,Droning,"Audio Book review - It wasn't the worst book, but it was very long and droning. However, it was only 5 CDs long, and that is a rather quick read. Something about the narrator or maybe the lack of a gripping plot, made it feel much much longer. In the end it became oddly confusing and I kept trying to remember who all these characters are and what their relations were to one another. Only because it was so long and so full of holes and twists, it became almost boring and hard to pay attention to. However, I can see that Kellerman may be a good writer of other books, so I will give him a chance and pick up another audio boook. It was a good enough book that I kept listening to it. However, I kept listening hoping that something would happen and that all of this time would have a pay off. I was wrong."
1,Not a Good One at All!,"This was perhaps the absolute worse Jonathan Kellerman going!I have read at least two-thirds of his novels most of which are quite pleasing and entertaining, some more wierd than others...Not good at all! Really!At any rate, I agree completely ( as does my wife), who feels as did a recent reviewer; it would be incredibly fantastic to find that this novel was not something from his distant past, that was now thrown in for a quick hit....It was formal, unlike any other of his novels, truly BORING X 10, and we barely got through it on a relaxing summer vacation.Both of us felt it was just terrible at best! Rent it on audio book at the library, that way you can stand the horribly slow plot culminating in a relatively exciting (much needed) ending...."
1,Worst Ever,"I was a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman, that was until this book! A see-through plot and ""the Club"" was just bizarre to say the least.Hopefully the next book I read by Kellerman (if I read one again)will be better as this was a waste of my time!"
2,Not up to par,"I didn't enjoy this book much - we spend too much time ""in the narrator's head"", with long drawn-out, repetitive thought processes. The plot was disappointingly predictable, and the tension between the main characters, the detective and Jeremy, was sadly lacking. Kellerman can do much better.."
3,Not His Best,"I'm a long-time Kellerman fan, but I didn't care as much for this novel. It is extremely slow-paced, which is not necessarily a bad thing if there is some feeling of direction or plot movement, but it seemed missing here to me. The story seemed meandering and obscure, and I didn't find the characters to be compelling."
2,So who cares?,"The main characters were all people, if I met them in actual life, I would do my best to avoid if I had a choice--either boring or worse. When Jeremy first observed the elegant dining club located in the strangely abandoned warehouse district, I thought I was in some King/horror clone. The story just never got moving, either in plot or character development.Maybe Jonathan needs some advise from his wife Faye."
1,I just can't believe he actually wrote this,"I am a huge Jonathan Kellerman fan - have read everything but this new book is just incredibly boring. The language is very self indulgent and where plot shoud be, there are just endless descriptions of people or events that don't really relate to the story. The only thing worse is the reader of the audio - flat, dull, the story may be putting him to sleep and his ""female"" character voice is just terrible. I was also offended by the need to use stereo type descriptions of Asian characters in the book. Very unusual and I'm so disappointed."
5,"""Dude"" in beginning of Disks 4 & 5","Didn't anyone notice that at the beginning of Disk 4, Track 11, just a couple minutes in, David Birney slips in a blooper? Prune faced nurse, blah, blah, blah. They say, ""You're important to me."" They're saying they need to get together for lunch, and one of them says, ""Let's do that ... **Doooode.**"" Totally, out of character for two dead-serious soap-opera, intellectual type doctors. Hilarious! But odd no one's mentioned it. He does it again on Disk 5, track 10. They're having lunch in his office, and they chide each other for not eating enough. ""I'm fine. So am I, **Doooode**!"" Anyway, great book, at least on audio. I picked up a couple themes that seem to come up more than once with Kellerman, but don't want to spoil the book. ~ Linda"
2,How Lame Is This Plot?,"How lame is the plot of THE CONSPIRACY CLUB? So lame that even Kellerman realizes it. Because he takes this ""plot"", with the same red herrings, twists, and ""the old switcheroo on who the real killer is"", and recycled it into half of his next Petra Connor series entry, TWISTED."
2,New shrink just like the Old shrink,"I'm a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman and have read all of his books. The plot of this one is a bit too familiar. Psychologist help police solve brutal killings. And there's even a Robin-esque woman by this side, but not too involved in the murderish goings on.I hope he brings back Milo and Alex -- why try to remake the original characters, when they are already done so well."
2,Not What I Expected.,"I suppose not liking this book is my fault. I was expecting another Alex Delaware and didn't realize this was a ""stand alone"" type of novel. Maybe I didn't give this one a chance, but I don't think Conspiracy Club comes even close in character development to the Delaware series. I wouldn't recommend your purchasing this one but borrowing from your public library. The story line isn't even that imaginative nor able to captivate and hold your attention for the length of the book."
2,Boooring!!!,"Is this reall written by Kellerman?? Why do authors DO this; abandon a character that the public likes....see Patricia Cornwell's HORRIBLE Isle of Dogs when she dropped Kay Scarpetta...where are Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis?? One reviewer referrred to them as ""stale"" ??? Not to me; I want more. I'm glad I checked this out at the library instead of wasting my money. I hope he or his staff reads these reviews, This character is weak and the whole story is simply NOT what I was expecting. Mr. Kellerman please bring back Dr. Delaware!!!!!"
4,Loved Jonathan Kellerman,I love his books and this is just another one in a long line of good novels. Thank you for your work .
2,Not up to Kellerman's standards... do you think he had a ghost writer?,I was disappointed in this book. It was not up to the usual standards of Kellerman's work.... no flow for me. I have been an Alex Delaware fan since he first started years ago... this is the first book of Kellerman's that left me cold. Hope this isn't a trend.
3,didn't go anywhere,"I hadn't read this author. He's a good enough writer I got to about 100 pages, but it didn't seem to be going anywhere. Might read something else of his eventually."
1,Nothing like the others,"I, too, have been very into the Alex Delaware novels and was so excited about this one coming out. I was also disappointed when I found out it had a new main character (after I checked the book out), but was willing to give it a fair chance. I had to fight to stay awake almost 100 pages into this book, as it went nowhere! Arthur Chess is such a pointless character and the conversations they have are as boring as a forced lecture in college. Bottom line, if you have not read the previous books with Alex in them, go back a few in the series and read those. Save yourself the time on this one!"
2,Jonathon! Why the pretentious writing?,I have read every one of Kellerman's books and also have multiple degrees in English. So why am I running to the dictionary every 3 pages? Scrofulous? Remora? Come on......It detracts from the storyline and is pretentious. Give me Alex Delaware and easy reading anytime.
1,Very disappointing.,"I hoped that with a new protagonist, Jonathan Kellerman would once again come through with a goodd read, but I found this as bad as most of his recent Alex Delaware novels have been. There is no comparison between the early Alex Delaware novels. The Butcher's Theater (the best) and his recent books. Maybe he shoult take a rest."
2,Second-rate,"As tired as I've gotten of Alex and Robin's love trials, I couldn't help but miss that dysfunctional and self-important duo while reading ""Conspiracy Club."" This book's main character, Jeremy Carrier, never comes to life and his adventures sound like Kellerman is phoning it in. . On the plus side, Kellerman's writing is as always a cut above the usual and he has good control over detail and pacing. Unfortunately, the women in this book make even stick figures like Robin seem complex. The scenes in the conspiracy club are cartoonish and about as menacing as an afternoon in a nursing home rec room. Bring back Alex and his rich boy, can't commit melodramas! As much as he gets on my nerves, at least he got a bit more to him than a ""tragic secret."""
3,Try Again...With Lower Expectations,"I really wanted the THE CONSPIRACY CLUB to work. I struggled through the first half of the book and waited for it to set the hook and give me a reason to continue reading. There wasn't one to be found. I even committed the cardinal sin of mystery/thriller readers and skipped ahead to get a jolt and a clue of what was going to happen. Even that failed to excite me to read further. I want desperately for Kellerman's latest to be up to his high standard and be the 5-star thriller other readers have reviewed, but for now it isn't. So I'll try again...later...and lower my expectations. Maybe that will work."
2,Clinical and Borning,"When I first read the Amazon review of this novel, I was intrigued. Never a fan of Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels, I thought I might give this a try since it ""re-invigorates a number of tried-and-true mystery conventions,"" was ""gripping"" and ""intricately plotted."" I found this novel to be neither gripping nor intricately plotted; in fact, I found it tedious and quite boring. The main character of Dr. Jeremy Carrier is neither appealing nor likeable. He came off has whiny and little self-involved for my taste. Yeah, yeah, I know he's just been tough a terrible ordeal, but please!"
3,You should do better.,"A decent story but too wordy and full of itself. I found myself wondering about this book when I wasn't reading it but when I picked it up, it was predictible and left too many ends dangling."
2,Boring,"The author is reusing a similar plot device than in ""Twisted"": a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything. That is a poor strategy for a mystery novel, because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes.The narrative in general is not Kellerman at his best, either. The characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do.A small part of the book talks about Brazil, and Kellerman simply invents a couple of Portuguese words making them sound Spanish: (""favilla"", ""favillitos""). One wonders how much of the author's research is similarly fictional.In sum, a book carelessly executed."
3,entertaining but kind of depressing,"""The Conspiracy club"" is told through the eyes of Jeremy Carrier, a psychologist at City Central Hospital. Throughout the story Jeremy tries to come to terms with the brutal murder of his girlfriend, Jocelyn. Other murders in the area occur in the same fashion and it's apparent that a serial killer is responsible. Although, Jeremy is a primary suspect for the murders and is harrassed by the police, he begins to investigate the murders himself to find the killer. He begins a friendship with the eccentric Dr. Chess, who is himself interested in the causes of bad behavior and evil.I found my first book by Kellerman to be entertaining,but has a depressing tone throughout and contains characters that seem a little one dimensional. Still at times, Kellerman seems extremely insightful in his descriptions of human interaction. I plan on checking out some more books by this author."
3,Not his best!,"I read everthing Jonathan Kellerman and I'm a great fan but this outing was not his best. I agree with many of the reviewers who were dismayed by the lack of character development of the CCC members, the long drawn out path to the final conclusion, the somewhat irritating and whiney main character and the quick resolution of the plot. The story line was great but the execution was puzzling. But--as someone else said--Jonathan is allowed a stumble or two. We still love him!"
2,THE CONSPIRACY CLUB,"If this was my first Kellerman novel I would have been captivated. Kellerman has a unique writting style which I believe captivates and keeps his fans coming back for more. But Conspiracy Club was not his best. I was disappointed by the lack of development of the ""Club"" members characters. I also found Jeremy Carrier rather boring. Though it ended with Kellerman flare, I fear it was a case of ""too little too late...""not his usual page turner.But Kellerman cannot please everybody all the time, and he is allowed the odd bad book, as long as he follows it up with a smasher like Therapy."
2,Story took way too long to develop,"Very dissapointing. As a huge fan of the Alex Delaware novels and Jonathan Kellerman's style of writing, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I found the main character, Jeremy Carrier, to be sad, whiny and an all around boring guy! The story took forever to develop and by the time it did I had stopped caring what happened. He spent too much time introducting characters that ending up having little or nothing to do with the plot. I was surprised at some of the twists near the end, but they weren't enough for me to recommend this book. I finished reading it only to find out ""who done it"". I recently read his new novel ""Therapy"" which I would recommmend along with most of the other Delware novels."
2,What happened???,"In the past I have found Jonathan Kellerman to be my favorite author, having read every book he has ever written. Conspiracy Club, however, does not live up to his previous works. The plot was weak, the characters even weaker. I found myself bored and thrilled when it ended. Mr. Kellerman, please go back to your previous style, this was simply not worth reading."
2,The Conspiacy Club by Jonathan Kellerman,"I have been rading Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels for years and I have really enjoyed them. I was so disappointed by his new novel The Conspiracy Club. It moved so slowly it was painful. There were no interesting characters. I can't even remember the ""hero's"" name. This one wasn't worth the time. I was glad when it ended."
1,unabridged reading untenable,"I have always found that a good reader can make a mediocre book more interesting and a bad reader exposes weak prose in a few moments. This audio book has the one of the worst readers ever and writing so poor that even George Guidall would be hard pressed to keep me listening.I agree with an earlier reviewer's thought that this book seems to be from before Kellerman's Delaware success. The use of latin names of diseases without a translation and clumsy use of language (When was the last time you found the term ""jimcrack"" in a novel with a modern setting?). And, this book suffers the worst of Kellerman's other novels: endless and pointless mental dialogue by the lead.All in all this audio recording is a must avoid."
2,Shouldn't Reading Be Fun?,"This is so wordy and difficult to read, that it wasn't even worth finishing. I was VERY disappointed in this author, since I usually enjoy his writing."
5,Really good!,"I'm a big Alex Delaware fan, so I was unsure what to expect from this new Kellerman. But it turned out to be a great read. Really enjoyed it!"
2,"Alex, Come Home","When I saw a new Kellerman book, I snapped it right up and went right home to read it. I kept waiting for something to HAPPEN!! Guess what? When I finished it--still nothing. And Jeffrey was not even an interesting character. Why do authors who have great books and great characters have to leave them behind and do something DIFFERENT? Bah Humbug!!!"
2,Bring back Alex,"Hard to get into, I am accustomed to getting into one of his books and not putting it down until I finish it. This book is taking me weeks to finish. It just has not grabbed my attention. I say, ""Bring back Alex Deleware!"
1,Disappointment,"I love J Kellerman's books, and couldn't wait to get my hands on the latest one. I didn't mind that it is not part of the Ales Delaware ""series"" - I very much enjoyed Butcher's Theatre, and Billy Straight. But this latest book is so incredibly longwinded and boring! I cannot get into it, I do not care for any of the characters, and I am now on page 278, and still haven't found anything interesting in this book. I will finish it (sometime), just because it is by Jonathan Kellerman. But I think it will go to the 2nd hand bookshop straight away - and I still have all his previous novels, and reread them again and again. PLEASE - no more Dr Carrier!!"
4,"Great value for a cute, useful book","I bought this book as a gift for someone who likes artichokes, and they are very happy with it. It contains lots of recipes for different ways to incorporate artichokes into your cooking. The person liked it so much that they requested another copy to give to one of their friends.The book is adorable also, it's cut in the shape of an artichoke. It's a paperback, but the front and back cover are very sturdy. It's a great gift idea, or a good buy if you love artichokes. You can't beat the price, give it a try."
3,Good while it lasted,Have had this machine for about 14 months. Worked great until recently when it just stopped working. Unsure I will buy another.
1,Unhappy about the coffee maker seent to me.,"I expected a brand new coffee make, not a refurbished one. This machine has some drawbacks, on two different ocassions I experienced luke warm coffee. I am extremely upset that I was sent a refurbished model without my knowledge."
3,"Works great, but not for too long","My wife loves this coffee maker, but... They last no more than 2 years so as long as you know this going in, you won't be disappointed. We're on our third one and keeping our fingers crossed this one lasts longer than the first two."
2,"Makes great coffee, Bad Electrical work","just threw mine out, sent it back twice, the third time it quit, Cuisinart refused to cover under warranty...even though it was the same exact problem. The Coffee pot just fades away electrically....until it does not turn on anymore...lasts an average of 9-12 months. Never buying Cuisinart electrical appliances again."
2,"Works great, then quits","Our Cuisinart WAS a wonderful coffee pot. We loved the ability to have fresh coffee for several hours. But, unfortunately, one day it just stopped brewing. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Customer service tells you to leave it unplugged for 30 minutes and then retry. That worked at first, but now it doesn't brew at all. I'm going back to a less expensive coffee pot that actually works when I turn it on."
3,one of the better Ellie Haskell novels,"I've read four books by this author, three of them about Ellie Haskell, resident of Chitterton Fells and member of the Library League. In some ways I thought this was the best of them all -- Mrs. Malloy is hysterical here and the premise revolving around romance fiction is funny as well. But there are also minor problems. The mystery itself is confusing -- lots of people die, but not necessarily of unnatural causes, and the tension never really builds; the depiction of the village's two librarians is lazy and stereotypical; and two of Cannell's best characters, Freddy and Jonas, are not here -- they are away on a camping trip!Despite the problems this is a fun book. I would recommend it if you are a fan of the author, but not if you are mainly interested in reading a challenging mystery."
2,Uneven cozy mystery,"This is a cozy-style mystery: written about the happenings in a small village, with a lot of emphasis on the characters. It has a good deal of dry humor - sometimes so dry you almost miss it. I managed to slog thru the whole book, hoping it would get better, but it really didn't. The pacing of the story was very slow, and there was no real sense of suspense or building towards a climax. The high point was barely a bump in the road. There were just too many subplots and points that distracted my attention, most of which didn't have enough of a payoff in the end when the threads tried to come together (and many of them didn't link at all) I suppose some of the plotlines were intended to be red herrings, but it is overkill when you're completely distracted and bored by long tangents that have no satisfactory resolution."
1,defective copy,"i just received my copy of this book from amazon. it is clearly defective. the editor's introduction has been left out completely, and probably about half the pages of the text itself are missing. amazon should do a recall of this book, assuming the other copies out there are the same."
1,Don't waste you time...or money!,Found this book to be a totally self-serving testimonial to its author. A quick skim indicated not much of value - or interest - in it...so I returned it.
2,"Good foundation, but weak execution","I was excited to read this book based on the everyone's comments. However, by the end I quickly realized it lacked the takeaways one expects.It talks in length about how to promote yourself, but it fails to drive home the distiction between those who promote gracefully and those that just brag. I was expecting to learn this difference based on the title.It never happened. So I give it two stars based on some good content, but no more given it misses the mark."
3,Good for useful nuggets but might be familiar if you are have previous knowledge of elevator speeches,"In a nutshell, this book is about elevator speeches. If you have studied up on this subject before than this book may not prove to be all that ground breaking. If not, then you should definitely pick it up as it covers a very important topic in the business world and provides valuable nuggets sprinkled throughout.I didn't care all that much for the format which was essentially a bunch of stories of other people, which is all nice and dandy but I could have analyzed the same stories and concluded everything on my own without her interpretations but I am still not quite so sure about how to convey my own success. Her examples covered mainly CEO's, Presidents, etc. so no wonder their story sounds amazing!! Gee, wouldn't have guessed.I also got distracted by several spelling/typo errors throughout her book, it becomes even more glaring when the book is covering the topic of effective communication."
3,Well told,"This book was surprisingly well written. I picked it up on a whim and enjoyed it mostly for its subjective nature and flawed, gritty characters. I won't reveal the plot of the book, but suffice it to say - if you're in the mood for a down-to-earth, gritty picture of rural america, check this one out."
3,not as good as the cover art,"Someone (Talking Heads, perhaps?) once said, ""Words are a trick to make people listen to music for longer.""That's the problem plaguing this album. It has wonderful guest vocalists, and the idea of pinning beautiful voices singing relevant lyrics to smooth and ethereal drum-and-bass cuts has a lot of promise.But lyrics alone won't save a middling musical effort. This disc could have been a lot more, especially given the talents of all involved. The bottom line is, if you focus in on the music itself, there just isn't that much going on, and many of the tracks are repetitive and overly simplistic. It has a certain charm, but as far as vocal electronica goes, there are things that are musically a lot more compelling out there."
1,Don't buy the book...,Don't buy it because you may want to purchase the product. The only strategy that I want to figure out is how to get my money back for this waste of an optic disk.
1,Slow.Slow.Slow,Slow.Slow.Slow.Enough saidI really wanted to burn Hemingway alive (but...that's out of the question)Plot was awfully developed.
1,This book did not even deserve one star!!!!!!,"This ""novel"" was the worst ""piece of literature"" I have ever read. If you can spare yourself from the agony of reading a hundred or so pages about an old man and a fish, than do so. This book brought the worst period of my life to a dramatic climax. I was more miserable reading this book than when my wife divorced me and my parents disowned me. I now have no one but at least I don't have to read this book anymore. Thank you god."
1,THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA,"The Old man and the Sea is a story about a lonely unlucky old man who never loses his faith even thought he has not caught a fish in over 80 days. Even thought his fishing partner, Manolin, was ordered by his parents to leave the old man, Santiago Still continues to fish. And then one day while he is out fishing the amazing happens, he catches that one dream fish. The Old man and the Sea does not deserve the praise and adoration it gets. This book deserves to be cast adrift from the landmass of literary works.The Plot of this story is slow and dull with little action. In this book action is like a slug slowly climbing up a steep hill, it takes for ever and ever to get to the top. For Instance, when action comes it drags on and on. Action in this book is like running backwards; it takes forever to get anywhere..."
4,Papa at his best!,"This is one of those rare novels that a fan can read and re-read every few years without any loss of enthusiasm. The story is a simple yet profound one about struggle, loss, and the human condition. The flow is strong but not cumbersome like some of his other books and is as refreshing as an icy glass of Carribean rum. Find out for yourself why this work cemented Hemingway the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954."
4,The Old Man and the Sea,"The old man and the sea is a short but invigorating book. Its about an old man named Santiago and his habbits for fishing. He has been fishing all his life, but lately he's hit a bad luck streak. The olny one left that has any faith in him is a young boy. Read this book and enjoy a new look of life from a desprate man, and the enormous fish he tackles. Learn courage, and a sense of dignity and being humbled all at the same time, from this timeless classic written by Ernest Hemingway."
2,Definatly Not A Favorite,"This is the first Hemingway I've read and I have to say that I was disapointed. I did like the scenes with the boy and the old man but that was about it! But when he is at sea for five days I got tired of reading it and wanted to stop the book. As one reviewer said, ""The story line was dragged on..."". That sums up exactly how I felt about the book. When I learned it won a Pulizer I was even more surpirsed. When I talked to other people they felt that he deserved a Pulizer for his other books and maybe they just gave him the Prize because they felt they needed to. I'm not sure and I'm probably wrong. To me, it seems that you either loved it, or hated it. I've talked to people who think this is the best book ever and I've talk to people who didn't like it at all."
2,This book has no storyline.,"Philip Pullman, my favorite author, once said that a lot of novels get so wrapped up in showing off beautiful writing that there's no story, and the story really should be the most important thing. I agree with him. This book seems like just an excuse for the author to explain his view of the world, and life, &c, &c., and the author forgets to put an interesting story in it. Luckily it doesn't get too boring because it's short. I also hate fishing, and I hated the author's writing style, which sounds like it's trying so hard to be simple and profound. The author also sounds snobbish and superior at times, and at other times like he's trying to show you, look at this character I've created, isn't he wonderful. For a novel with deep things to say and beautiful writing AND a great story, try Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass."
2,I didnt like it,"This was an extremely boring book to me. I had to read it for school in 8th grade,and I almost fell asleep reading it. I think a big part of it was that as an 8th grader i didnt understand a lot of the hidden meanings of the book. I didnt like it also because it was very slow going and the end is a dissapointment to me. Also, none of my friends liked it either"
2,Great symbolism...not overly interesting story,"This is a book of great descriptions and great symbolism. It's great to write a book report on but if you're not a Hemingway fan you probably won't enjoy it. It's a good book to see if you like Hemingway or not but not a great book otherwise. Must read for Hemingway fans, read it once just so you're familiar with it otherwise."
2,"In this corner, a 1500 pound Marlin...","My fiancée hated this book; she told me it nothing but fish and machismo - futility personified as a short novel. After absorbing the story, I cannot agree with her. While it may appear to be nothing but a fight between an old man and a big fish, it is more. It is struggle. It is pain and perseverance. It is the acknowledgment that sometimes defeats look like victories, and victories defeats.That being said, I can now also say that I am not a fan of Hemingway's choppy writing, his overly overt masculinity, or his cavalier attitudes towards death and pain. But it is worth reading, especially if you like the things do not."
2,"Come on, folks. Seriously. I'm reeling it in.","Wait, no i'm not. Yes I am. Wait, no I'm not. This book sunk even below the low level of literary decency that i have come to expect from Hemingway."
3,A demonstration of an old man's desire to catch a fish,Overall I thought that the book was a little bit boring. But what I really liked about the book was how an old man was determined to(catch a fish) acheive his goal no matter what obstacles he has to overcome. Before arriving back at the town the old man wonders if catching the fish was worth it because of all the trouble he went through but he has accomplished his goal that he once thought was impossible. And at the very end of the novel when the boy is laying beside the old man is dreaming about the lions(he has accomplished his goal and he is a happy man)
2,bland story line . . .,"quick synopsis for those of you who havent read it and are considering it: an old man is pulled around the ocean by a fish, talking to his HAND (yes, his hand) and ends up almost dead for a fish that eventually gets eaten by sharks. There you go. Sound good to you? No. I kept wondering what would possess a man to write and publish a book with a story line like this. I understand all of the religious imagery, and all of the symbols with the mast, and everything, but this book really sucked! But, I dont really think that it deserves 1 star. If you want a good Hemingway read, I recommend A Farewell to Arms. That is a great story."
3,A Book... What's there to say?,"The Old Man and the Sea is a story about an old man named Santiago and his love for the sea. It showed his satisfaction for conquering his goal, however there was nothing to show of it but bones. But..... this book was also kinda long... even though it was only one hundred something pages, it should have been about 35, without such drawn out descriptions, and still pass for a ""classic"""
3,It wasn't that good,"The book THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA was a short novel. To tell you the truth that is about the only thing I find good about it. The many allegories and ways to interpret it left me completly confused. The over all theme was a cute idea, an old man and the love for the sea and the boy, but I think it could have been written in a better way. Like I said it was short which is a definate plus when it comes to required reading. Maybe if I could relate to the book or the story line I would have enjoyed it more. Maybe I'll like it better when I am older."
3,Not My Cup of Tea,"To put it bluntly and honest I found ""The Old Man and the Sea"" incredibly boring. It's surprising that a short story could have such descriptive, drawn out parts. This is why the story lacked interest for me, the descriptive words took up most of the book not leaving much of a story line. Another factor for the dislike is that it's all about fishing, and since I don't like fishing the dislike is obvious. Many people say you have a look beyond the fishing for the symbolism, but considering I couldn't get into the story and that I have a very literal mind I didn't see any of that. I'm sure it was a well-written piece for those who can enjoy that sort of thing, but it wasn't my cup of tea."
4,A Strange Tale About A Man & A Fish,"This is a strange monologue about an old man & a fish. The old man Santiago is down on his luck, having endured 85 days, without a catch. He believed that his luck will turn and continued going to sea. Indeed, his luck turned put for the better and he caught a huge Marlin, which he battles with care and respect. Finally after 3 days of struggle, he lands the Marlin with a sense of profound victory.However, on the journey back to the port, the dead Marlin was attacked and devoured by several schools of sharks, leaving a skeleton of the magnificent fish. The old man went to bed tired but without much despair.So what was the moral of the story? Your luck will turn out better if you are patient, but regardless of your attempt, you cannot avoid fate.Did I read that Hemmingway won a Nobel Literature prize on the strength of this novel? In my opinion, it was undeserving. But it was a good attempt."
3,Pretty Decent Read,This book is about a man who lived all of his life on the sea as a fisherman. He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the gulf stream.He had gone 84 days with out catching a fish.He went out to sea one day and cought the bigest fish which was 18 feet from nose to tail He stayed 2 days and two nights in the sea fighting the bigfish no food he would catch fish and eat them raw no salt.
2,You call this a masterpiece?,"For barely 100 pages long, this thing that enjoyed worldwide claim is hardly a page-turner. It is so dry and uninteresting, full of repetation, boring description. The author does lack of the ability of using dialogue to tell a story. The dialogue or monologue is, at best, pretty weak. The book is certainly over-rated. The reason that it won the Nobel Literature Prize is what it claimed politically."
3,"Definitely a slow moving plot, like an old man would be","Although I did find the ""waiting for interesting things to happen"" bit of this read to be tedious, I think that is what Hemingway was trying to portray...how much patience and tedium a fisherman must endure just for those brief moments of excitement when he ""outwits"" a fish. The sad irony of course is that he himself is then easily outwitted by the sharks. It is depressing how all our hard work and accomplishment can be so quickly eaten away by theives. I agree that the reading was mediocre."
5,I got it!!,"In the tradition of great Ernest Hemingway books, The Old Man and the Sea is another success. In my opinion the book was written and very descriptive. The caracter Santiago was close to being an excellent example of a Christ-like figure. The last chapter of the book you get a good comparison of Santiago to Christ on the Cross. The book really shows the similarities. Manolin was also a interesting representation of a disiple. He looked up to Santiago as Jesus' disiples had done. I would very much so recommend this book to anyone it is easy for kids to read but still entertaining enough for adults."
4,Somtimes I would get lost in the story.,I liked reading this book. I was always trying to think what was going to happen next. Most of the time it had me wanting to now what was going to happen. When he caught the fish I thought he was going to get the fish on the boat easily. I don't think I would try that hard to caught the fish. When he describ the fish it drew a every vivid picture in my head. I didn't think he was going to live. When he finly caught the fish I thought he was going to make it back. I think for how old he was he strong to caught large fish and not be dragged in.Seth Hahlen
3,I believe it had an intriging implied meaning.,"The old man in the sea had a very intriging implied meaning, yet the story line dragged on. It is a spirit lifting book. I believe that it can teach the human race not to be materialistic, and that there are much more important things in life."
4,Battles with Life and the Sea,"The Old Man and the Sea, by Ernest Hemingway, is a short novel about an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago, the many struggles he faces in his life and his main conflict with a large marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. The details of this novel are very specific and to the point. It does not seem like Hemingway used any special techniques to try to attract the reader even more towards the novel. However, the novel was still enticing, and clear; unlike other authors, Hemingway did not keep me bewildered throughout the whole novel, and then surprised me with a bad conclusion-it was the opposite of that. I liked that Hemingway used various themes like courage, loneliness, defeat, and others. I also liked that Hemingway used very detailed descriptions of everything he talked about, and he used very simple language, comprehendible to everybody. I found the novel interesting from beginning to end."
4,The old man and the sea,Does not disappoint. A GREAT story!! My favorite Hemingway book and I believe his most beautifully written. Lives up to its reputation as a MUST READ CLASSIC.
4,the old man and the sea,"""The old man let him hit the fish and then drove the knife of the oar down into the shark's brain."" This quote from the amazing book ""The old man and the sea"" by Ernie Hemingway makes you stand at the edge of your feet. The author did a very good job using imagery because during the whole entire book I was able to picture everything in my mind. For example, in the part were Santiago is fighting for what he wants I could feel his emotions. One thing that made me love this book was the theme, which is so aspiring because it teaches you determination and how to endure pain and it also shows you how anything is possible. I really recommend this book who loves to read for the reason being that it can relate to almost anyone because every human being has come to a situation were there just about to give up. Ofcourse you would have to read this book for your self and I guarantee that you wouldn't resist buying it.E.T."
2,It doesn't hold my interest,I bought this book in preparation for a visit to Cuba that included a visit to Hemmingway's home. That was 4 months ago and I still haven't finished the book. The only reason I might go back to it and finish it someday is that it was written by Hemmingway and it is considered a clasic.The subject just doesn't speak to me.
4,Very Interesting,...The book The Old Man and the Sea is one of the best books I've read. The reason is it is an adventure and I LOVE adventures. The adventure part is cool. It is about an old man and his fishing trip. He was out on the ocean for at least 84 days. On the 84th day he caught a marlin. This book is also very descriptive which is sometimes hard to understand. This author likes to make people understand that the person that suffered was very strong.
4,A Classic Tale of A Fisherman and His Prey,"In my opinion, The One Man And The Sea is one of the great books by Ernest Hemingway, if not in all literature. The struggle between the fish and Santiago (the fisherman) shows that humans aren't always the greater force. At the end the struggle taught him a lesson, and also thought me a lesson. It taught me that everyone struggles, but there is an end to that struggle. He had a lot of courage and determination to get the marlin. The relationship with Manolin and Santiago was a good one. Manolin was there for the old man at the end. Overall, it was a good book, and it was a pleasure to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fishing or the sea, like my uncle. I hope you read the book and enjoy it as much as I have."
2,Man + Fish = Book,My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.TWO STARS for your book Ernest! One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)! Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up!
1,This book isn't worth the paper it's written on !,"Santiago, an old fisherman, is the main character in the dreadfully boring book The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway. The short, choppy sentences ruin the plot which is Santiago trying to catch a fish.If you haven't read this book yet, then don't. You're not missing anything. The main and only real conflict is that he's an old man and he hasn't caught a fish in almost 3 months.This book couldn't possibly be at all interesting. However, if your trying to die of boredom this is the book for you. If you do choose to read this book, may the force be with you"
2,Disappointing,"The book is a classic, I'd highly recommend it, but this edition is full of spelling and punctuation mistakes. I was disappointed in that, because it's a paid book, not a free one. I expected better."
3,Truly Hemingway,"A breathtaking story. If you want to understand Hemingway's philosophy, read that story. The only thing, not typical are the missing women, but in that story, they won't do anyhow."
4,Not the best book for school.,"I had to read this book for a school project, and it wasn't the best choice. Yes, it's short, but it's also very slow and not very interesting. If you have to choose between this one, and another, pick the other, because this book just isn't a good choice to do a project on. If you're reading it just because, then go ahead, it's easy to understand."
5,MARVELOUS READ,I CANNOT BELIEVE ALL OF THOSE FOLKS WHO GAVE THIS ONE STAR.TRY GOING BACK AND READING IT AGAIN.GREAT READ.
3,Required Reading is Boring,"The Old Man and the Sea is one of the worst books I have ever been required to read. The first chapter put me to sleep. I found the fishing examples and language hard to follow since I have no interest in fish. The one thing that I found interesting about the book is the way Ernest Hemmingway wrote it as a reflection of his life. Hemmingway, like the old man, had not had much success for a while in his career. The entire story is left free to interpret it how you wish. Fatalism takes place when the shark eats the fish, Endurance takes place when on page 64 it says ""He was comfortable but not suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all."" This book is considered to be one of Hemmingway's greatest books. With this stated I might venture to read one of his books again but not for a while. I think that this book would be far more appreciated by someone who is into deep thinking. Myself...I like the point of the story cleary stated."
2,Sentimental,"What do Saddam Hussein and the American reading public of the 1950s have in common? They both loved this book. Its easy to see how Saddam saw his own predicament in this sentimental story of an old fisherman landing and losing a legendary fish. Hemingway was not, unfortunately, a good novelist. Hemingway's best short stories are some of the finest in the English language but he doesn't seem to have been able to sustain character and plot development sufficiently to produce really good novels. Even this short novel displays Hemingway's weaknesses as a novelist. Even worse, it is sentimental beyond belief, without any of the clear-eyed irony or insight into human nature exhibited in the best short stories. This is a weeper for middle-aged men. See any of the great Nick Adams stories for comparison. While this book appears to have revived Hemingway's career, at least in terms of popular readership, it really shows the decline of Hemingway's powers."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to read this acclaimed book but in honesty, was just disappointed by it. Not that the writing style isn't good, not that the story isn't interesting. Yes, as many critics say, the book touches on many topics of human personalities, flaws and qualities. But when they say ""touch on"", that's really all it is. If you are looking for insights, for inspiration in any of these topics, I think you are better off reading Herman Hesse. So much that it's clear to me that the level of awareness that Hemingway had was quite lower than that of Hesse. Where Hemingway saw that there was more to man than his action and thoughts, Hesse saw emotions, yearning and melancholy.Perhaps 50 years ago, with the level of consciousness society had, this was a good novel. But today, the main value of this book is the details of fishing at the time."
4,Not as bad as my fellow teenagers make it seem to be,"This novel is not my favorite, and it is not(in my opinion) my favorite Hemmingway novel; however, after reading all the worthless reviews by other high school students, I knew I had to make a comment. This novel is a brilliant story about a man's personal victory. It is also an ingeniously analogous to Jesus Christ's struggle. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I got bored the second time I read it. Did you kids even pay attention in your english classes?"
3,"Moving, but also a bit dull.","There is nothing inherently wrong with this book. It actually moves along quite well. At times Hemmingway's sparse and arid prose is maybe a little too one dimensional to sink your teeth into, but he gets his point across. We understand quite well the degree of Santiago's persistence, and bad fortune, yet he still persists. There is zero pretension in this novel and that makes the simplicity of the fisherman's life that much more authentic. If you're a Hemmingway fan you'll like it. If not, you won't... 'cause it treads the same stylistic grounds."
4,"""The Power of Hemmingway""","The title and cover of the fabulous book, ""Old Man and the Sea"", give you reason to believe that the book is all about and old man fishing (at least thats what i thought!). Suprisingly, after reading the short, easy to read, book, and discussing it in great depth with my wonderful teacher (hi- Mrs. M :)!), my perseption of the book changed completely. Throughout the novel, the reader is introduced to the old man and his daily fishing activites. Hemmingway writes the book so well, that the reader feels as if she's experiencing all that the old man goes through. I hope you enjoy the novel as well as i did!"
4,A classic!,Fun book to read while sitting on the beach or on vacation. Makes you feel like you're on the end of the line with him!
4,don't read the introduction.,"What a great story, but the introduction gives it all away. It would have wrecked a lesser book. It took alot away for me. I'm done with introductions, i'll read them in the rears from now on."
3,Hemingway's weakest work IMO,"I didn't really like it as much as I thought I would. I love Hemingway's style of prose, but I have to admit that I just didn't really like this novella very much. It would have been much better as a short story in a collection or anthology instead of a full novella. I'm not saying its bad, its just that I had high expectations because I love most of Hemingway's other books(For Whom the Bell Tolls is my favorite), but this felt weak and repetitive. I dunno, read it for yourself and find out. Nothing is wrong with the binding or the paper or the printing. It isn't an exceptionally strong binding(I wouldn't recommend it for a library, I slightly tore a page the first time reading it because I turned it too fast) but it is on par with most book bindings and paper qualities."
3,The perfect book for high school reading,"This is my first Hemingway story, and was pretty pleased with it. I have always been told that his writing gets right to the point and that he's not a ""flowery"" writer, so I wasn't surprised to see how long this story was. On the surface, the story was very exciting, even more so at the end when he battles the sharks. As I was reading it, I would get so excited whenever he ran across another shark I didn't even want to read those parts. I was really rooting for Santiago, and felt totally gypped at the end! In terms of reading the story for just ""more"" than the story, I found that the themes are very easy to identify and talk about so that would make this a great ""discussion"" novella, and it's no surprise that this is a frequently read book in school. This is an excellent starter book for those who are interested in reading a story for more than face value. It's not too long and it's themes and symbolism aren't too vague to understand."
3,"Water, water, everywhere!","""The Old Man and the Sea"" is a narrative with a complex perspective. Although our class has differing opinions on the enjoyability of this novel, we can all admit that it is a great classic for a reason.It lacks spark and action -- or does it? While it might not be as exciting as ""The Hunger Games,"" it does explore morality in a subtle way."
3,I liked this book,This book was fine. I enjoyed the book and I was rooting for the main character. I was hoping that the main character will win the fight. I do not want to give too much information about the book. I hope you enjoy reading this book
5,Quintessential American Novella,"The Old Man and the Sea is an iconic short novel by one of America's most recognizable twentieth-century authors - equal parts compelling narrative and profound universal truth. Hemingway spins a tale that can be taken in at face-value, read metaphorically, or interpreted philosophically. Essentially, it is a man-vs-nature tale, but as it deals primarily with the old man, it comes across a bit existential - not the pessimistic existentialism of someone, like say, Kafka, but the optimistic existentialism of someone who knows what he must do and does it, and although the old man might not be in control of the outcome, and might even expect it to end badly, he refuses to abandon his task. The work is short, and can be digested in a few hours, but oh, what a beautiful way to spend an afternoon."
4,Autobiographical insight,"So much of Hemingway's work paralleled his own life, this story is no different. Santiago the old man losing his ability to fish as he did in youth; Hemingway the aging writer without quite the literary prowess of his earlier years. Yet both of them are tied by the unpopular opinion that they have one 'big one' left in them. As the pages turn and the story unfolds, the reader discovers the poorly kept secret that they were both right. A lyrical story of poignance and import. An elegy for our greatest narrator. Well done."
1,"God, This Boring Book About Fishing Should Be Banned--","it could be single-handedly responsible for narcolepsy. But I guess since the bigshot Hemingway wrote it, we're all supposed to nod our heads and smile and say ""way deep novel symbolizing man's struggle against nature"" like subjects in The Emporer's New Clothes. Well, I for one will not call invisible talent talent just because it was written by ""literary"" royalty. Please, spare yourself the misery of this dreadful waste of trees. Hopefully, it is no longer required reading like it was when I was in school."
1,0 stars!!!,"What was the point in this book? The guy sat in a boat for God knows how many days to catch this fish. Yeah, happy day, good for him, but who cares?!"
4,Life's struggles should never get you down...,"This book left me feeling - no matter what, I should never get down about life's struggles. The old man in this book struggled for days to get the big marlin, only to lose it on the way back home. He hoped the marlin would bring him success and fame - however in the end he realized that was not the point of his mission. It was a great book to put my life back in perspective! Better than any self help book..."
2,! WARNING! Hemingway Fans Only!,"OK book, well developed and deep symbolism. WARNING: this book may be extremely dull to those who seek action and suspenseful novels. This book doesn't exactly capture you, but tugs you along. I recommend this book only for: Hemingway fans, those who like symbolism in a novel (this one is perfect for u guys), speed readers (read it and you'll find out why), if you have to ( book report, required by a class). If your one of those people that is always reading, ex. once they finish a book they look for another good one, what I call a ""relaxed leisure reader"",this is not for you! Also one last thing, if u do read it, make it a ""bed time book,"" so you can focus easier on the symbolism, details, etc."
2,"Have Not, if it's all the same to you","I am no fan of The Old Man and the Sea, but it's worth publicising more widely the little-known story of its genesis. The Old Man and the Sea was actually an allegory of Hemingway's doomed attempts at wooing Norma Jean Baker (Marilyn = marlin: geddit?). He saw himself as the ""evolved"" being of man against the ""shark"" of his contemporary Arthur Miller who nipped and nipped and was the ultimate victor of her affections."
2,feet or old man?,"I just have a brief comment on this so-called ""legendary"" American novel. It has been a while since i read the fun little book, so it might deserve a second glance. Nonetheless, i'd like to say that in my opinion, one should be able to remain awake during a ""good"" book. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case with Old Man And the Sea. Though it's symbolic references may be partially interesting, what is the use of a book if it can't even keep you awake or inspired. Simplicity may be able to be used to an advantage in some cases, but i found that in Old Man and the Sea, the attempt was a flailing and defeated one. I won't criticize Hemingway himself because i have yet to read his other novels, but i must say this was a particularly big dissapointment. Authors hitting closer to home to being ""legendary"" american novels would be Kerouac or even Fitzgerald."
4,Efficient service,"Although the book didn't arrive as quickly as I would have liked, it was in excellent condition as promised. Would definetly use this service again."
3,Old man starts to get old after a while,"Old Man and the Sea is a very intresting book. Actually it is intresting in the first fifty pages. After that the excitment of him catching a fish, turns into something entirely different. For almost the rest of the entire book, the old man is being dragged along behind the never tiring fish. Frankly, it starts to get boring. Even with the occasional exitement, such as the giant fish jumping from the water, this fator of it seeming to drag on, brings it score down to only a 3."
