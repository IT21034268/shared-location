3,May work for you,"This book contains a few chapters on introduction to the Java programming language (which are by the way very good) but it is a reference book, and if you are looking to learn Java buy something else. I find that I never use this book (accept for the afore mentioned chapters) but many people around me do, and find it quite useful. If you are comfortable useing the api docs, use those, but if you prefer to use a book by all means try it."
3,Dry reading,"It gets three stars for being so comprehensive. However, it really is a dry read. After trudging through the first five chapters I turned to Bruce Eckels excellent and lively work, which, aside for a few odd comments on pass-by-reference, is a far superior introduction to Java. Even so, Flanagan's work is an extremely useful and precise work. A worthy addition to any wood-be Java programmers bookshelf."
1,"Incomplete, badly organized, terrible index","Avoid this book. Although there is no indication on the cover, it completely skips major sections of the language, such as everything pertaining to Sql and databases. It is organized around package names, which makes it difficult to look anything up. The index is incomplete and doesn't indicate what pages classes are actually defined on.(...)"
1,use the sdk documentation instead.,it is much better to use a jdk documentation which you can download instead of this reference book.
2,One of the worst books I've ever read!,"It's hard to find what you're looking for. There are no good descriptions, no good examples. I find it pretty dry and useless. Java Unleashed book is 10 times better than this one."
1,Pathetic and no sign of any syntax except for first few exs,"Its a sad book and is not for a beginner for ofcourse.The author assumes the reader to know the basicity and thorough terminology of OOPs Its plainly apathetic attemt and nothing but a java in a bumbshell,only the price is not a bite otherwise guys stay away from it or you will be disappointed and your spirits will be done if you really need to learn java"
4,A Must-Have,"This book is a must for using JDK 1.1. The first half of the book clearly explains the new 1.1 features. The only problem I have is that the last half of the book is just a listing of the API. This just pads the size of the book, because all of the information is available on-line. I guess it's supposed to make you feel like you're getting much more than you are. For the price, however, you are still getting more bang for your buck than any other Java reference book."
2,Not worth it,"The title of the book is misleading. You would think that now that you have that book , anytime you face a new concept in Java you will refer to it and ""bam"" you've got everything figured out. Very untrue. The thickness of the book accounts mostly for the large Java API , and not all of it mind you. The author will let you know that the rest of the API is listed in his other book ""Java Foundation Classes in a nutshell"". But why would you want to buy two books to have the API when it's already online. And the chapters that precede the API listings are very short and stingy on information , but these same chapters can be easily found in any other book and a little more for a cheaper price maybe."
3,Leather Bound Complete Sherlock Holmes,"It is a leather bound hard cover and the leather is very thin. Not like your typical leather bound bibile which is all leather and of varying sturdiness. Concerning the wear of use, the book appeared sturdy enough but I couldn't tell because the seller shipped it to me in a paper thin plastic covering without any stuffing, cardboard, or any kind of protection. So whether the book was sent damaged or damaged during delivery I cannot say. The binding was split from top to bottom rendering it useless, difficult at best."
5,Best pinball simulation of the 32 bit Generation!,"If you are a video pinhead, I highly recommend this title. There are four tables to choose from, each with reasonable physics and great replay value. The music and sound effects provide plenty of atmosphere, which is a crucial element of many a good game. If you do not own a Sega Saturn, I believe a couple of these tables were re-released for the iPhone."
3,Die Trying- Die Trying,"This is a good to great CD, 4 or 5 of the songs are great the rest are good. A must have if you are a fan of Trapt, Smile Empty Soul, Linkin Park, or AFI."
3,The Bad Boy Side of Pop Punk,"not too terrible i guess , actually pretty good. But sadly not at all original! it's pretty difficult to distinguish one song from another. there are a couple of filler songs but hey it's better than average (barely). but after all is said and done there is some hope for this band cause after all they are pretty talented they just seem to put themselves in that strict mindset of how pop punk is ""supposed"" to sound."
3,Papa Roach with a new name?,"I loved the single oxygens gone and i read the reviews that every loves the band so I got the cd. I was sadly dissapointed. They can right semi catchy music but nothing is new and original here. If you like papa roach and need something to get u by inbetween this is the cd for you. But if your looking for something new to try out, skip this one. No new inspiration here."
2,Nothing special,"How would I describe this album to someone who has never heard it? Pop-punk combined with nu-metal. And yes folks, that's pretty bad. The album itself contains a few redeeming moments, even if the style the band presents is pretty stale. The second signing to Papa Roach's imprint El Tonal (formerly New Noize; home of Alien Ant Farm), Die Trying's primary goal seems to be biting the style of a band that was never too original or creative to begin with. The bulk of the songs sound like Papa Roach b-sides, and with a song featuring Roach's frontman ('Conquer The World') the band doesn't seem to care about distancing themselves or creating a unique style. All of the songs sound the same, that is every single song. There is no variety on here. The opening track 'One Day At A Time' is the only standout. If the album's single 'Oxygen's Gone' excites you, and you don't mind hearing 11 other songs just like it, grab this CD."
1,Someone Kill Die Trying And Make Them Happy,"Well kids, this cd is stuck in my cd player, but only because my cd player is a peice of sh*t, and so is this cd. This band thinks far to highly of themselves, ""Oxygens Gone"" is the only decent song, and it gets old. ""Dirty Dirty"" has to be one of the stupid f*cking songs I have ever heard. But then again, no song tops the others on this downward roller coaster of a cd, if you want to call it a cd. I prefer to call it a coster to set my drinks on. Do yourself a favor, and don't buy this cd. Don't let ""Oxygens Gone"" mislead you like it did me. The saddest thing could be, I only spent 7 dollars on this cd, and it was the worst 7 dollars I could have ever spent, especially since the sh*t from my a*s sounds just as good in my cd player, and atleast it won't get stuck."
5,"New Band, Great Music","Die Trying has just gotten some air play, and has done a very great job on their first album. It's a great album if you like bands like Papa Roach. Some of their better songs are Oxygen's Gone(first single), F**k You, Conquer the World, and Dirty Dirty. Over all a 5 star album. Hope they keep on putting out more like this."
4,A Better than Average Alt-Punk Offering,"Die Trying is a step above their contemporaries because of intelligent song writing and diversity through the album. However, these songs are still not truly amazing on the album. However, live these guys are amazing. After seeing them in concert with Evanescence, Revis, and Depswa (all three bands being better than Die Trying, but still...) I was convinced that this album would be great. I was a little disappointed, but it has a great re-listening value. Also, instead of being caught up with childish antics (Sum 41 and Blink-182), being the voice of pop/rap oriented kids who like to jump around a little bit (Good Charlotte), or singing about sweaters (Weezer), they present a darker side of alt-punk. All in all, a good debut. I look forward to bigger and better things from them. They have the potential to improve greatly upon this."
2,The older one is better,"As an English assignment, we had to compare the older version to this one, and the older one is clearly much better. The acting in this version is horrible compared to the 1961 version. Sydney Portier is clearly the better acter as all the other ones in that version. So, if you have already seen this video, do yourself a favor and rent the older one for a more enjoyable performance."
1,boring soap opera style film,"I just can't see why this gets good reviews. It's basically a long, drawn out story about the life of a black family in the mid century. Save time and money, pass over this lemon. No action, simple, unintelligent storyline (wah wah....it's so hard being black, etc.), and dry acting....I'd rather see Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon. If your looking for a touching story of the hardships blacks have faced, pick up Mississippi Burning."
5,the definitive version,"I have seen this video more than ten times, and I have beenmoved to tears every single time. _A Raisin in the Sun_ is a greatplay, and this video gives you the closest possible experience to seeing the play performed live. A couple other reviewers ... found the acting dry and inferior. I'm dumbfounded by this reaction. Danny Glover and Esther Rolle are absolutely brilliant. By contrast, I found the 1961 version starring Sidney Poitier to be overly melodramatic in tone. When Poitier as Walter Lee breaks down, he raves like a lunatic. When Danny Glover breaks down, it's scary because he is so believable. As a college professor, I have shown this video to many classes and have always gotten good reactions. If you want to see a great production of one of the monuments of the American theater, I can't recommend this video highly enough."
4,a useful collection of case studies and key papers,"This book offers a large number of case studies from the areas of research and technology development in various industries. It covers most the important concepts of technology management such as ""core competencies"". It follows the traditional model employed in business schools: learning from others' experiences by means of case studies. Particularly relevant are the sections on ""heavyweight teams""."
4,A Good Time,"This is a delightful read. A sweet and humorous tale of a bright, but slightly neurotic poet meets adventurous girl scientist. Her research on parrots in their native habitat and his guilt over throwing his screeching parrot out the window, leads them both to Equador.I love to read a novel in which I not only enjoy the story, but also come away with a little more knowledge than I had before I started the book. The descriptions of Equador and it's terrain did just that. One does not have to be a bird fancier to enjoy this story. This book was well worth the time and money. I plan on sending my copy of Elsewhere in the Land of Parrots to my daughter who happens to have one of those screeching conures in her living room."
5,Birds of a Feather,"Jim Paul's novel is a very enjoyable read. For anyone who has seen the movie ""The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill,"" this novel adds another dimension to that experience by explaining the native origin of the parrots as well as the ""civilization"" origin. Intermingled with the story of the parrots is a charming love story of a woman who is investigating the parrots in their native habitat and a rather grumpy, lost soul who has contributed to the fate of parrots who are released far away from their natural home. I would highly recommend this book; in fact, I've already given a copy to each of my children."
4,Love in the Land of Parrots,"This is a very sweet story of romance set against the land of parrots in Equador. The story alternates the lives of two individuals and their quest for self-realization, purpose and ultimately love. It is a rainy-day novel or bedside buddy, the kind of book that can easily be put down only to be thinking about it and then eagerly awaiting that rainy day or end of the day when you can snuggle back up and head to the land of elsewhere. The characters are not flashy, heroic or larger -than-life but they are endearing, identifiable and a tad bit quirky. It's that quirkiness that sets the pace from beginning to end and is sure to capture the hearts of bird lovers as well as those for a yen to travel to distant, exotic locales in search of intrigue, adventure, and love."
1,Don't bother,"Unless you live in a cave and never heard of 'watercolors,' don't bother with this book. It's written for 2 yr. olds and has no new imformation. The whole thing is about 60 pages and is the size of Pop Tart. Do yourself a favor and just go to your public library and get a book on painting there."
4,One of the best and cheapest shumps available!,"This game is really fun and was under $10.Galactic Attack is well worth buying,Saturn has some great shmups that went unnoticed like this game.GA has great special effects,cool atmosphere,and a nice set of weapons/guns.The explosives and backgrounds are beautiful,one thing great about the Saturn is that it handles 2D really great,it was made for it!GA doesn't have any slowdown whatsoever,even with all the bombs and shots going everywhere.This game is a must have if you own a Saturn or just love shmups,I just recently discovered them.This game is kind of hard to play if your not use to playing them like me.I recommend Galactic Attack to anyone who owns a Saturn and actually likes to play great video games like this one."
4,Great Deal and Service!!,"Great deal, service was as promised (received new pair and in perfect condition in specified time).These have some prescription (wish this was posted before buying them).Otherwise, very happy with my purchase (comes with a nylon case and silk, cleaning sheet)."
1,"This book is a waste of time & money, no quality control","Do not buy this book. The code is full of bugs and does not appear to be tested by the author. You will spend ... and waste many hours trying to get the code to complie. The code is not very well explained in the text. Overall, the book is very disappointing, and really a huge waste of time.O'Reilly have a big turkey here. Save your money - buy something else."
1,Plenty of non-working code,I lost a lot of time reading this poor book and trying to run incomplete code. The line followed by the author is very confusing. He is always trying to approach a lot of things at the same time. I think a better help with working examples would be Java Distributed Objects by Richard Soley. I would give a zero-star review for this.
5,Wow,"For years the Maazel/Cleveland recording of the Roman Festivals has been a classical guilty pleasure of mine. Very exciting music, played extraordinarily well, and despite the piece's reputation as ""classical junk food"" I found it a wonderful listening experience.When I saw that the Penguin Guide made the relatively unknown Gatti/St. Cecilia recording one of their top picks (the only drawback of the recording being a too-wide dynamic range!) I thought ""Yeah, right..."". But the whole disc is an amazing accomplishment- Festivals, Fountains and Pines. I had no idea this orchestra could play like this.Gatti's performance of Festivals lacks a tiny bit of the adrenaline rush and raw ferocity that Maazel brings, but only a tiny bit. Gatti's is a more ""rounded"" performance; little touches make it feel more paced and less ""assaultive"", if you will. But it lacks no excitement. It's perhaps more highly detailed than Maazel's, and in every way it's compelling and ultimately satisfying. Highly recommended!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book before the previous two reviews were posted. I puchased the book based on the expectation that I would be able to use it to learn RealBasic. The author takes you through many theoretical problems without leading one step by step in designing a program. Whereas the description of the book states "" If you've never programmed before, the book offers both a primer in REALbasic ..."" I found this tottally unture. For the programmer new to RealBasic I'd reccomend using the online tutorials and staying away from this book."
3,"Good, but outdated","This covers some really good information, and really expands on what is found in the included documentation, however it is woefully out of date, and only getting moreso with the impending release of version 5.0 next month. If it covered a 4.x version, I'd have given it at least a 4, 4.5 if I could."
1,Too many words,"My programming experience = nil. I am not counting AppleScript, HTML, JavaScript. When I bought this book I was hoping to get some help. Reviews were great. I found that: the purpose for writing the book was to show off the richness of authors vocabulary. He didn't want to teach. He wrote it to ramble about RB, his point of view on certain aspects of RB. He doesn't explain almost anything in a simple, straight forward way. The examples of code are very limited. I retyped more than ten of them and not even one (!) of them worked! Program either froze or crashed or just didn't compile. I am better off using the Developers Guide from RB and Language Reference. Some tutorials on line are also helpful. This is an example how a ""guide"" shouldn't be written. I am just a beginner - I may be wrong. The book might have been written for RB gurus. I didn't learn almost anything from it."
3,good supplement for experienced programmers,"I'm a professional programmer who recently started using REALbasic. I wanted a book to tell me how to do specific things - not teach me programming.This book, by itself, is not the book. But then neither is the documentation that comes with REALbasic. Whenever I wanted to do something different, I found myself flipping between this book, the Developers Guide and the Language Reference. Usually I needed bits of info from each.In fairness, perhaps a cover-to-cover reading of the book would have given me a better foundation with the language. As it is, if you want to get started fast and learn as you go, this book is a useful supplement - but not a complete reference."
3,Real Basic: The Definitive Guide,"Although a good book, I found it to be way out of date. So far in fact that some of the basic code statements and controls are no longer referenced by the same name. It is specifically written for the MAC, but as you know Real Basic is the same for MAC, Windows and Linux. But this book has a specific MAC flavor. It wasn't much use to me."
1,RealBasic is not definitive.,"After wishing for many months for a programming language similar to Visual Basic for the Macintosh , I was immediately pleased when I heard of the RealBasic announcement. I looked for books on the application and then heard of RealBasic-The Definitive Guide. Great! I thought I would finally get down and dirty with RealBasic on the Mac. Unfortunately I was disappointed as I read this book it became apparent that it was more a computer science tome on OOP. It lacks useful practical information on RealBasic and any useful illustrations to back up the facts, as most VB books do. In fact it is mostly a rehash of the manuals RealSoftware gives away free on the web. I found myself consulting the manuals with this book in hand to make any sense out of it. My conclusion, caveat emptor."
4,A must have reference.,"REALbasic : The Definitive Guide is a must have reference to the REALbasic language, possibly more complete than Real Software's own documentation. While it is a great beginning guide for the experienced programmer who is new to REALbasic, the beginning programmer will stay confused throughout much of this book. It dives right in explaining the syntax of the language with little explaination of how to use it. A more step by step approach would have been more easily understandable.That being said, I would recommend this book to anyone who is serious about programming for the Mac OS, but expect to use it as a complement to other learning sources, not as the main learning tool."
2,Intermediate Level and Up,"The editorial introduction claims: ""If you've never programmed before, the book offers both a primer in REALbasic and an intuitive approach to the concepts of programming itself, as you quickly reach the ability to program every aspect of REALbasic."" I would caution prospective purchasers against believing that this is the ideal introduction to REALbasic. Although this book is the most comprehensive of the third party publications on REALbasic, it is definitely not the starting point for beginning programmers who want to learn to program with this user-friendly development environment. Probably the best introductory materials are the company's own comprehensive set of materials. This book would be useful after one has mastered the rudiments of the program."
3,"Whoops, where's the errata?","While ""Linux Programming by Example"" is very educational for someone who is new to Linux Programming, the book is marred by endless typographical and programming errors. I have gone through the first 9 chapters and my error count is easily over 10 by now.Que gets bad marks for not providing *any* errata for this book. While someone who is at least mildly proficient in C should be able to fix the bugs, providing an errata would show dedication to quality. The code can be downloaded from Que's site easily. The code all compiles correctly and comes with Makefiles omitted from the book.All in all, this is a great book for learning programming. The book goes into enough depth in several subject areas to give the reader a taste of what can be done in linux. The book is definitely intended to be one that you read cover to cover."
4,"A more recent ""edition"" is available","""I bought the book and started to read: Page 3 says: ""To see the code for this book, go to ...and type ..."" Apparently, the link is broken.""I think this book is ""discontinued."" The author Kurt Wall wrote another book with Mark Watson: ""Linux Programming Unleashed"". I guess you may download some similar code at this new book's site: http://www.quepublishing.com/title/0672320215#"
5,Catapult Your Understanding,"For many mastering K&R marks the end of their investigation of C, this is a mistake. K&R is only a milestone and Linux Programming By Example shows you this.While armed with the book you will be able to put together almost any program you heart may desire. Making it truely a book that takes the skilled programmer and shows you why you bothered to study so hard."
4,Pretty good book,"The general idea of this book is: ""Here's a few examples, now go read the man pages"". Which I don't have a problem with.However, this is NOT a book for beginning C programmers. It mainly focuses on system calls, signals, processes, and the like. I think it should be used as a POSIX geared supplement to ""Advanced Programming In the UNIX Environment"".By the way, pages 134-135 contains a typo. In the paragraph ""The Access Bits"", 1 is execute, 2 is write, and 4 is read. The author corrects this in a later paragraph.All in all, I'd say it's a good book for users looking for more insight into UNIX and Linux development."
2,poorly designed figure,"Luke Cage is cool. He is a badass character, and the comic that comes with this figure displays that well, and is what more of the Marvel Legends' comics should be like.This figure, however, is lame. Mine has soft plastic in the legs, and the torso barely moves. The chain-belt was lose, and his head barely has any mobility. It just doesn't seem to work very well. (Don't even get me started on his left hand. NOT human looking.)"
2,Misleading and Disappointment (otherwise good),"As my title suggests, I was disappointed in seeing that 85-90% of the book was about the author's product (3rd party library of PL/SQL packages). So if you have not purchased the software, book is not useful. Only the first 3 chapters are about packages, the rest about PL/Vision.I am a HUGE fan of Steve Feuerstein's books, but this one was a disappointment. If he takes those chapters out then it would've been 5 stars, but I can only give him 2. Sorry Steve.Gio"
3,Not a book I would keep refering to.,"Being a Feuerstein 'fan' I bought this book hoping to learn a lot more about PL/SQL. I did learn from it, but not a lot. For those familiar with 'Oracle PL/SQL' and 'Oracle Built-in Packages' from the same author (both of which I highly recommend) Advanced Oracle PL/SQL is just not worth buying."
4,Spooky Ambiofunk,More on the groove ambio waxy side. Leaves the listener... if still able to think... waiting for the climax. PERFECT MUSIC for late night heroin parties
1,Dented,"The item was sent in a manilla envolope and was damaged dents in the screen its ok where the plastic is not dented.I also expected a hard frame, just a sheet of plastic.Too expensive and too damaged for the price...Mr. John L Sanchez"
3,Good Product,Bought this for my wifes grandfather. He has a degenerative eye disease that is cousing him to lose his sight. His eye sight had gotten so bad that he could no longer see the text in his books. This magnafier did help alot. I will say that it is a little funky to use. You do have to adjust it a little to be able to read through it. It does work well after you get it set in the right spot for your eyes.
3,Literalist biblical evangelism,"I found it difficult to give a numerical score to this novel. As hard science fiction I found the Apollo-related story outstanding. Woven throughout the story, however, was a Christian theological plot that to me became stronger and increasingly heavy-handed until the end of the novel. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it is not for me. Towards the end I almost felt as though a televangelist was standing in my house pushing upon me a literalist view of the bible that I do not subscribe to. If you do not mind a sermon incorporated into every part of your life, and you like good science fiction, you will enjoy this book. Otherwise, you may find it difficult to suspend your disbelief, particularly in the last chapters.I am not saying that this is a bad book but it is not for everyone."
5,Much more than a visit to the moon!,"This book started as a fictional moon landing, but blossomed into much more. It ended-up addressing the possibilties of how man may have advanced at one time, before our modern age of technology. It also addressed the depravity man could have reached at that time. I enjoyed the thought-provoking concepts the author weaved into the fabric of the book, as they were an interesting take on a time that most people view as primitive, but really may have been much more. Exactly what am I referring to? Well, you'll just have to read the book to find out. You won't be disappointed."
3,There is no fence........,Great alternative history book. The book is a strange brew of Christian beliefs and Science Fiction. It shows some insight into the Apollo moon missions.
1,"Forget it, unless you are a bible-thumper","I picked this book because it combined a couple of interests of mine (alternative history, Apollo moon missions, etc.) The first 3/4 was a decent science fiction treatment of a Apollo mission gone bad and the struggle of some astronauts to survive. Not Heinlein but solid enough to keep me skimming through. The end, however, turned into a total Christian bible tract as the author turned from a fairly solid and technically sound story (at least in science fiction terms) to a tortured effort to connect what had come before to a literalist interpretation of the bible. I guess you if you are into that but it is really not worth it if you are not. Basically you are asked to throw out all scientific reason at the end and embrace Christian mythology. Yeah....that kind of attitude would have put man on the moon........sigh"
2,Great for a while!,"This product was not cheap enough for the trouble and I only paid $7 for it. The first one I received DOA, the seller (Tech for less) was great and I received the replacement product within days. This one worked great...for about a week and a half then it would cut out randomly on my PC at work and my Mac at home. The hardware would shut down, then power back on, I just gave up on it and bought another brand. Once again I learn that you get what you pay for!"
4,Great little device that works well,I was a little Skeptical at first with bluetooth add ons with Windows but the product works very well. I have been in IT for quite a while so I think I have seen a lot of products and their claims for simplicity.Buy this and you should be quite satisfied.Tom Secreto
1,Book has mistakes,"This book (like TOO many of these study guides) has obvious typos and annoying mistakes.For instance, on page 188 here's what it says:32. answer (C)blah blah blah...That fits (A) pretty well. Watch out for choice (B). It looks reasonable...but it doesn't quite work, since the author doesn't make such a definitive statement.HUH????? WHAT ABOUT ANSWER (C)?????When you go to their even-more-annoying web site, you can not find where they have bothered to publish any corrections.I'm sick of this nonsense from these books. They're expensive and they should hire editors."
2,Good but outdated,"To be brief, this is a great book, but you will almost certainly want the newest edition of it."
4,Quality Built Alternator,Works as advertised. No problems. Excellent price at 53 dollars versus 107 dollars at the auto parts store.
5,Great Read!,"You will not be disappointed reading this book. I checked it out of the library and will now go and buy the book. I absolutely loved this book. Instead of it being a story about two people, it is a story about three couples. There is suspense throughout the whole book and you won't want to put it down. You will fall in love with all three couples. I wish there was sequel to it."
1,Complete Junk,"I ordered a bunch of these candles to accent our front windows. None of them worked worth a darn. The metal parts on the candle don't connect well with the metal in the base. Thus, the candles don't light up at all. They take a lot of fidgeting around with in order to get them to work. And they seem to need adjusting every few days.I would avoid these at all costs."
1,Battery powered candle,"I really thought I bought more than one for $7+, I had to go back and check my order on why I would pay so much for just one candle. It was for One. Went to the local thrift store and found 5 battery powered candles for $2."
2,Cellulite Patch,"I only recommend this product if you can afford to buy it every week. The patches are supposed to be used 2-3x per week & there are exactly 6 patches. Also, while you do see results in a week, it is only in the rectangle-shaped spots you where you used the product. Looks a little strange to have smoother skin only in those areas. The Nivea good-bye cellulite gel-cream & fast-acting serum are more effective at a reasonable cost."
3,"Product no good,","believe what the other people tell you, these patches don't stick well. at first they do but if you move it or rub against something, it'll never stick again! they also don't do what they're supposed to. stil got my dimplies. at least the seller ships fast."
3,OK but better the cream/gel,"The patches are OK, the gel feels nice...but they won't stick to your skin so would move and could be see through clothing. Better to purchase the cream /gel."
4,Cute gift for new couple,I gave matching mugs to a newly engaged couple. They loved it! Everyone seems to like coffee mugs and this is a nice size.
5,Wife,"I bought one of these as a gift for my wife at Barnes & Nobles and she loved it. And then she broke it, and then she cried, actual tears! It was her favorite! This was the only place I could find one. Guess who was a hero this Christmas!!!"
1,Careful when buying,"This appears to be a new movie bases on the previously released series of movies. However it is not. It is simply a retitled version of series #3 ""REVIVAL VILLIANS."" A new name and new DVD cover but the same movie. So if you already own #3 no need to purchase this one."
5,Sugar Creek Gang : Race Against Nightfall,Sugar Creek Gang Race Against Nighfall was originaly called Revival Villains and I now have two copies of the same movie. I'm not sure why you changed the cover and the title for this episode?
4,Nice Ice,"A well crafted tale of world saving and a complete turnaround for the series after the abysmal Treachery's Wake.Our three returning heros Regdar the fighter, Lidda the rogue and Hennet the sorceror are mostly who they were previously. There are some continuity problems with Hennet but nothing as egregious as previous continuity errors have been so I'm much more forgiving. The one-shot ice druidess was nicely developed, continuing with the tradition of the iconic characters being supporting casts almost to the better developed guest stars.There is nothing special about the plot, but it is well crafted and does a great job of projecting the cold to the reader. The dungeon crawl late in the book was actually entertaining and had some surprises. For once Regdar and Lidda didn't run in like complete buffoons, Lidda actually did some scouting.A bittersweet triumph, a return home and a nice night's reading is complete. This is the best iconic D&D book since Oath of Nerull, also featuring Hennet."
4,Good clean entertainment,"I Love the story, it was a clean movie that had humor, suspense and love. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a possible romantic alternative to real history,"
1,Not an instructional DVD,1/2 hour of Danny Morris playing with his band. No instructions on how to play or any techniques. I am a new beginner and it was not that helpful at all.
3,A Fine Book Badly Edited,"This is a very good introduction to C# but it's full of nasty little errors that the editors didn't catch. If you're new to the C family of languages the errors can be confusing.For instance, on page 162 Mr. Liberty writes: ""myIntArray = new int[5]"" and then states: ""This declaration sets aside memory for an array holding five integers."" The array really holds six integers. On page 223 Mr. Liberty states that ""In Unicode (as in ASCII), a lowercase letter has a smaller value than an uppercase letter."" Actually, in ASCII, ""A"" is decimal 65, and ""a"" is decimal 97.There are other problems like these, so, if something doesn't work quite right, don't take Mr. Liberty's text as gospel. Try some alternatives. It's surprising to see an O'Reilly book with errors like these."
3,It is a good book but it is somehow confusing!!!,"I have read this book twice except for the last two chapters, and I skip chapter 13.It is relatively easy to understand the concepts and the organization is relatively good. However, it would be better if the author could have summed up the main keys in each chapter in a conclusion or summary. I have to take notes here and there in the book to remember the key points. There were also a couple of errors in the book.I think it is a good book for a beginner with some basic background in C/C++."
1,"Buy ""C# Essentials"" Instead.","Book is fluff and filler without much useful information.If you want a C# language refrence or you want to learn C#, look at ""C# Essentials, Second Edition"" By Ben Albahari et. Al.Jesse Liberty clearly writes books to make money, not because he is good at it. This and his ASP.NET book have lots of filler and little valuable content. Both books are going back to O'Rielly with a letter of complaint.I can strongly suggest Albahari's book, it is incredibly concise, about 1/3 the size of Mr. Liberty's book, and it covers far more of the C# language than Jesse's book."
3,This is not THE book for experienced or inexperienced,"This book goes too much detail into intricacies of language syntax while the examples are too basic and confusing. Some times the important syntactical explanations are too vague and confusing while the infrequently used items are explained in too much detail. I have found that Wrox books are doing a much better job with explaining the concepts and their examples are more in depth and easier to understand. However, it does cover most of the .net concepts and some topics like Threads are covered in an extremely helpful manner. I find this book to be boring to read but will keep it as a reference, as overall, it is not a bad book."
5,Great book for learning C#,"This is a great book for learning C#. The first part is an excellent tutorial in the language, just right for experienced C, C++ and Java programmers and for advanced VB6 programmers.The second part introduces how to use the language to create .net programs. This is a bit superficial, but his goal was only to provide an introduction, and it is a very good introduction. For more detail on really building advanced applications you will need an additional book (like his book on ASP.NET).The third part of Programming C# goes into advanced topics you won't easily find elsewhere, with excellent coverage of (for example) threading, remoting, reflection, streams and so forth.Liberty writes well, his examples are terrific, and he makes complex material easily understandable. Further, he supports his book on his web site where he provides not only source code but a discussion center where you can ask questions.I highly recommend this excellent tutorial."
4,Not for those with a C++ background,"My background is in C++ with some experience with Java and no experience with .NET. I didn't fully realize how similar C++ is to C# until I finished this book, and I think my money would have been better spent buying a book on .NET.This book is 600 pages, but only the first half covers C#. The rest goes into using Visual Studio 2005 and various .NET classes, which applies equally well to any of the languages Microsoft supports. I didn't really learn anything new about C# that I hadn't already read in the various online tutorials. That's not a knock against the book - the information is all there - but if you know C++ and you're buying the book to learn C#, don't bother.Instead I'd recommend:1. Read an online tutorial or two on the difference between C++ and C#.2. Download Visual C# 2005 Express Edition (free) and create some examples on your own. The IDE is very good at funneling you into using the right syntax.3. Buy a book on .NET."
1,Not well put together,"I work through every example in a book to make sure I'm not glossing over important details as I read. What I found in this book was a real mess of code from one example to the next. Many times the code examples appear to be building on each other as you progress through each chapter but if you actually work the examples, you find that variable names are different, naming conventions are all over the board, and you end up spending time trying to figure out what changed instead of focusing on what you're supposed to be learning. It also felt like a lot of the concepts were just being tossed into the text instead of being treated thoroughly. I will say that I just had to stop after chapter 5 so it may get better but I'm really disappointed so I'm giving it a low rating."
3,"Okay book, but it could have been much better","Being a java programer for a while let's me understand this book. for all those reviews out there that say this book is great for beginners, I say NO WAY!! This book is definitely not a beginner book. it jumps into topics like inheritance and polymorphism extremely early for beginners to understand. I have to say that it definitely has some straight-to-the-point examples, but I guarantee the new guys you will have no idea what is going on. I still can't find any better books than Deitel books, you pay almost double the price of this book but it is definitely worth while if you are willing to learn programming. Also this book is a little vague on certain topics and does not talk at all about what is considered good/bad for good programming practices. I have not finished reading it but that's what I found early after reading upto chapter 10."
5,a good book,"Not everyone with mastery of a subject can teach it well. Mr. Liberty can, and does in this book. If you have a good understanding of C++ OO programming and are at least vaguely familiar with the concepts of COM/DCOM/COM+, then this book will be a gentle introduction. You can quickly skim through the first several chapters and then slow down for the main course. If you have no prior programming knowledge, you may find the learning curve a bit steep."
5,Second Edition,"I just bought the second edition and I'm sure that this edition must be better, but I don't know how. Coming from VB programming and wanting to learn C# because it pays better, I found this book to be exactly what I needed. I now feel comfortable doing C# after about 3 weeks. I know that anything I am able to do in VB that I can also do now in C#. Just a great training guide."
1,Not enough depth,"This book isn't simple enough for beginners, neither is it advanced enough for real programmers. I recommend you check out ""Mastering Visual C# .NET"" from Sybex instead: it is a much better book."
5,The best overall C# book to date.,"This is simply an excellent book, and probably the best overall C# book on the market today. Jesse has a very comfortable style of presenting the salient points of C# in theory and practice. This has to be read, and thereafter referenced, by any programmer working with C# (including the 2005 Beta versions), or planning to do so. Furthermore, source code and other info is available on Jesse's website."
2,3RD EDITION IS FULL OF TYPOS,"I returned this book after 2 days because of the numerous typos and other glaring errors.The ratio of obvious errors to good tips is about 1:1 for the first three chapters and I assume this holds true for the rest of the book. I don't know if these errors were introduced in the 3rd edition or if they are carry-overs from previous editions, but the number of errors is just unacceptable.If the errors and typos are corrected, this book would rate at least 4 stars."
1,Poorest O'Reilly book yet,"I wouldn't buy this book. It doesn't cover C# in nearly enough depth. Coverage of ASP.NET and ADO.NET is almost non-existent, and even the core C# language isn't fully coved: there's no coverage of date and time handling, and other critical language fundamentals are missing.The Sybex book ""Mastering Visual C# .NET Programming"" is much better."
2,Editorial problems and shoddy writing ruin this book,"If you want to see an example of why not to buy this book, see the ""complete"" code listing of example 13-3, which ends (abruptly!) on page 331. ""Abruptly"" means the end of the code segment is not shown! Sure, you can go to the publisher's web page to get the ""real"" complete code segment, but why should you? There are many examples of this in Liberty's book. A number of the examples, when followed to the letter, do not work. A number of other examples don't tell the whole story, and so you are left guessing about something or other. One gets the impression that this book was done in a real hurry, with little or no editorial oversight. I don't have a recommendation for a good alternative to this book, but I am definitely looking!"
2,Too Many Topics,"This book tries to cover way too much stuff in 500 pages. I think it would have been better as solely a C# syntax book (comparible to Thinking in Java). Instead it attempts to cover syntax, applied programming in the framework(web and windows forms), ADO.NET and other CLR topics. The first section is C# syntax and is ok ... could be more detailed. The sections on web/windows forms, and ado.net are overview at bests and are useless."
1,Confused and assuming,"I found this book one of the most confusing I've owned and I've bought 20 books in the past two years. The Author has a choppy writing style that leaves me highly confused. An example is the chapter on delegates and events...a short introduction, a complex example, a little more complex example, then more of a complex example...too much code samples and not enough concepts! I think a book should explain a basic concept with a short example first, then develop upward. Out of my collection of a few dozen books, I'm sad to say this ranks the lowest."
5,The best introduction to C# and .NET available,"Liberty's Programming C# is not only well written, it is a complete and thorough primer on C# programming. He begins with a terrific tutorial on the language, taking you through all the fundamentals, and making sure you are comfortable with class, interface, struct definitions and usage. He does not assume you already understand object oriented programming, but teaches the concepts as you need them.The second part is a good introduction to using C# to program .NET applications, including web services, web apps, windows applications, and the use of ado.netPart three is a real treasure. Here Liberty teaches the advanced concepts that are difficult to find elsewhere. He explains attributes and reflection, remoting, streams, asynchronous i/o, threading and so forth.The examples in Prog. C# are excellent; well thought out and on point. Liberty provides source code and other material on his web site.I can't recommend this book highly enough."
5,Good beginner book,This was my first C# book and it really helped jumpstart my career. I believe I purchased this book around 7 years ago. I've been professionally developing since 2005 and this book came in handy when I first was starting out.
4,"Programming C# Helps,","I Do Not Regret Buying This Book, Will Help Broaden Your Knowledge Of Language. I However Don't Understand Why New Old Computer Books Prices Stay So High While Their Information Value Decreases Quickly."
4,Good treatment of C# and a good overview of .NET,"This is a review of the 3rd edition. I am a diehard C++ programmer making my way into the world of .NET and C#. Bought this book to get up to speed on both.About half the book is devoted to C# and there is a good treatment of the language along with tips for C++ and VB programmers making the switch. The second half of the book consists of an overview of the major parts of .NET, including ASP.NET, Winforms, web services, the CLR, remoting, etc...I'd recommend this book as a good initial overview of C# and the .NET technologies to anyone coming from the Win32 platform SDK and C++ world. Very readable with concise code examples."
2,C# for dummies,"This book provides a lot of ""what?"" information, but not the ""whys"". After finishing the book, you are left with a lot of disconnected ""facts"" about C#, without a real understanding. I don't recommend this book for serious, thinking programmers. The Stan Lippman book is WAY better."
4,Great Book,Great for the new C# programmer. You really need to have an understanding of programming concepts to get the most out of this book though.Very good examples of ADO.net and real-world applications.
4,Excellent books for Beginners,I've read a number of books on C#. This book is defiantly the best place to start learning C#. Don't expect miracles. This will just get you started. And you wont loose interest half way through.
5,5 for 5,great book covering most of the details needed to have a solid understanding of whats going on behind the scene and on the scene.
2,Full of mistakes,"I read the first half of this, and found an error every other page, ranging from typos and missing brackets to plainly incorrect observations about hashing.I suspect the book was rushed to the presses without much proofreading."
4,Very thorough and descriptive. For beginners as well as advanced readers.,"Very easy to read, covers all the relevant topics. Advanced readers can skip the first half of the book."
4,Mother of ALL C# bOOKS,"Hiya ALL,All I can say is that this is the mother of all books. I like the way its written. But its a bit of hard at the beginning. I would have liked a soft start. But anyway, a goodbook."
4,Good stuff,The product is great and I was very happy with it. I would buy it again and again without any problem. The prices are good at Amazon and you can't go wrong
4,This is a great travel cup!,"I received this travel cup as a mother's day gift, and I love it. I read with interest the other reviews, and I have never had a problem with leakage. Of course, ANY cup will leak if left on its side, and the tab on the lid is for splashes, not spills. I love how it fits into my car's cup holder, and it fits comfortably in my hand. Also, I like how the sip hole is very near the rim of the lid...I have had spills with other mugs because my mouth did not conform to the shape of the lid. All in all, a good choice."
2,Cheap,"These doors are not worth the asking price. They shouldn't cost more than $100 or so. The upper halves are fine, but the lower halves are cheap as hell. I just installed these doors a month ago. The hardware in the handles is already rusting, and the handle latches and mechanical parts are not assembled very well.The reason why I gave these doors two stars instead of one is because when properly aligned, they seal VERY well, so I'm not getting rained and snowed on, and my Jeep is nice and warm this time of year.Do yourself a favor and buy some steel lower halves at a salvage yard, if you can find any. They're fairly hard to come by, but they're worth every penny. A pair of them usually runs about $100 or so cheaper than the cost of these second-rate doors. Why didn't I buy steel halves? Because I couldn't find any within a 150-mile radius, so I thought I'd try these on.Buyer be warned: don't waste your money on this junk."
5,Though it has been fun to roam...,"This was my favorite book as a child, right up there with ""But No Elephants"", also from the Parents Magazine Press. I had the entire book memorized and now, at 25, I still remember quite a bit of it and think of it often.I've saved my copy and I can't wait to share it with my children some day. It's a fun rhyming story with wonderfully entertaining pictures."
5,Great case for Motorola KRZR,"Very happy with the look, quality, and features of this carry case for the KRZR K1M. Definitely recommend."
2,OK for a limited audience,"If you are an experienced C++ programmer with extensive knowledge of the Win32 API, MFC, ATL and COM and you somehow obtained this knowledge without using any of the recent previous versions of Visual C++, this book is for you. Most of the information about the IDE is very basic and similar to previous versions of Visual C++, but the examples are fairly complex with little or no explanations."
2,Only Buy this if you know windows programming,"This book will only be useful to you if you already know Windows programming, and just want to learn how to use the GUI and Wizards. I have been programming iN Unix c/c++ for a while, and all I am lookign for is a that describes how to use/create some of the basic objects in Windows, I would love to hear of this book if it exists."
2,Average book,"This book is a quite good one to learn a bit of C++ pogramming, but for more details I would read a better book like ""Teach yourself Visual C++ in 21 days"" or other books you can buy at amazon!"
1,Nobody I work with likes this book,"This book was a great disappointment. Many of the examples deliberately bypass the automation features of VC++6 so that the reader has a lot of typing to do to try them out. While this may lead to better understanding of what's going on, it's not a lot of help to a new user trying to get started as quickly as possible. I also found it badly laid out, for example finding out how to create a tabbed-dialog screen was very frustrating until I learned that the author refers to these as Property Sheets. There's no mention of tabbed dialogs in the index, and once you know that you should look for ""property sheet"", the information provided is sparse. If you want to try to create a DLL, forget it... there's 4 pages on how to tell the AppWizard to set up the project, and a couple more about debugging, but zip about what the call and return sequence is for a DLL function."
3,A good intro book for Visual C++ v6.0,This book is a good introduction book to Visual C++ 6.0. It is written in the not so technical style so the reader does not get lost in the details. Recommend to all who have not used the Microsoft Visual C++ before.
1,"Too much emphasis on simple tasks, too shallow.","It has a comprehensive description of what menues and buttons you must type in order to use any function but it doesn't explain useful things like how to work with dependencies (with projects). Typical of Microsoft. The book is intented to be for intermediate programmers, but explains tasks too simple even for amateurs and at the same time assumes that you understand complex things (for advanced users)."
1,Structureless manual on the Visual C++ interface,"It is difficult to understand who could have use of this book. For those who master the programming interface of Visual C++ it is unnecessary, and for those who want to learn it, the book is too unstructured and confusing. The titel points to programmers, but nowhere the word ""algorithm"" appears. The lack of algorithmic programming structure is also reflected in the general structure (or lack of) of the book. As an example, toolbars are introduced before dialog boxes and the Class Wizard is explained too late. The book gives examples with detailed solutions with support of the attached CD-ROM, but no problems and exercises are found. I looked for a book to recommend my students on the Visual C++ interface, but this book is actually not a text book, but a sorts incomplete manual."
5,edit resource and source code when we're delete menu resourc,"edit resource and source code when we're delete menu resource it has error,How we're delete it?"
5,All-Weather Cruiser Tire,"I have been running a set of CS C241 tires on my 2000 Schwinn Cruiser Supreme since 2001 and they are still going strong. These tires have at least a couple thousand miles on them and the wear is barely negligible. Their performance in rain and snow is outstanding compared to all other cruiser tires I have used over the years. They are super stable at low speeds, as well as at high speeds on a straight roadway. This past Summer I had them wound up around 60MPH running down Colorado Highway 7 from Riverside to Lyons. Don't try this at home, kids! They even handled the curves in the canyon at speed relatively well, though the transitions were a little jumpy, as they should be with the tire's blocky profile. When the set I'm running decides to die, they will be replaced with the same tire."
5,Excellent road and dirt tire.,"I owned one of these tires when I lived in Arizona and loved it then, so I bought another and once again enjoy smooth cycling. Both times I have installed in the rear position replacing inferior stock mountain bike tires, both with blown sidewalls. These tires have excellent traction on both dry and wet surfaces, although the tight tread seams to throw a bit more road spray. I ride year round, traction is good in snow, only wiped out once on ice. Highly recommend!"
4,Found these tires locally,I found these nearly identical tires locally at a department store that starts with K and ends with MART for only $17.99 each... Their being sold under the Schwinn name but tires are made by innova. Tread is 100% identical. Blackwall sidewall fits same dimension rims as stated on here.I do love the tires though. I put them on my dads old late 60's Schwinn bicycle and they fit like a dream. The original tires finally bit the dust so to speak with cracked sidewalls. Still hold air though haha. Thought I would hare my findings. I have also seen these identical tires in whitewall and blackwall at another similar department store that ends in mart and starts with W for a cheaper price than Amazon...
5,Great Tires for Commuting,"It's just the perfect, affordable, road tire for a 26"" bike, with some thickness to hop on off and of curbs, bumps. potholes when necessary."
5,Exactly what we look for a long time,"I have a FELT MP with wide wheels and these tires are perfect.I find them cost a lot and I realized that part of the original are the only one who has the width specified for my bike.If you're looking for a TIRE wide, soft, this is what you should buy."
5,Totally Awesome Soundtracks!,"Wow! Let's see, ORIGINAL Star Trek (with William Shatner's voice over!!!!!!!), some Star Wars, all of Lost in Space, Babylon 5 theme (only one tho, pooh), and my favorite = Buck Rogers in the 25th Century!This is far and away my favorite of the Sci-Fi Greatest Hits series, although Volume 4 is also good ... um, actually, they are all good!"

3,Sweet <3,"Haha, I actually bought this a long time agobut I was really into Cyborg 009 then, so I HAD to have the cd(so I could get ""Genesis of Next"" out of my head, lol).It's very cool ---> it's got the whole techno sound goingand it just really grabs your attention.It was my 1st Globe cd, but if you've had a Globe cd before this,you should kind of have a feel for whether or not this is something you'd want; whether it's something different or not.Keiko's voice is amazing. I totally reccomend it <3"
1,Litle plastic bowl of death,This product and similar betta are little plastic bowls of death. It is way too small has no filtration. Bettas should be kept in tanks with proper filtration and aeration.
4,A decent tutorial for semi-beginners!,"The book is a decent tutorial. Quite a few people have commented it is no good for beginners. However there are different levels of beginner.I have used scripting languages and keep my own web pages. I understand the basics of if ..then and Loop's. I was therefore pretty much a ""Beginner"". i enjoyed this book (it's a while since I first used it) because it was about the level I required to move ""up"" to more complete programming. I now use servlets and components and get a great deal of pleasure from programming and solving problems. I think this book was set at a high enough level to keep my interest through the learning process, several others were good but so plodding that I could not sustain the enthusiasm to keep going.Im short, if you have used some scripting, maintain web sites and have a decent idea about computers then it will probably be challenging but rewarding. ""Comlete and Utter"" Beginners will find it assumes too much prior knowledge."
2,not for beginners... even if JAVA is a second language,"I have experience with other computer languages so I wasn't looking for a CS101 book. I was looking for what was described on the back cover, ""a comprehensive tutorial introduction"". My opinion is that it does not offer that. I've been introduced to C++ and it looks like it would benefit programmers coming from a C++ background."
2,Disappointing,"Not up to the standard I came to expect from ""Practical C Programming"". This book requires an existing knowledge of C, at least, and even then you're behind. It frequently refers to topics which haven't been covered yet, notifies you of confusing exceptions before you've even understood the basics, and the coding practice is bad for an introductory book. I'm not a code warrior, but neither am I stupid, and I'm disappointed by this book."
2,not for beginners,"This book commits the same sin of most Java introductions, it assumes you are familiar with OOP concepts & programming. The preface said it doesn't but it does. Also, there are very few complete examples. In some places there are very few examples of any sort. No programming book worth it's pulp should be so devoid of examples. Last, the book is far too wordy & not enough nuts & bolts. Not a good reference or intro."
1,Bad customer service,"I received the case in a timely manner, however, I was not satisfied with the product. I contacted the customer service department regarding their return policy and received a very unprofessional response from Tassie. I will NEVER purchase anything from this company again and I would not recommend anyone else to either."
2,Heartwarming Story but Terrible Acting,"After reading other positive reviews, I was led to believe that this was a well-done, heartwarming story. The story line is fine, but the acting is appalling. It was almost painful to watch. This movie was a big disappointment."
3,It was good,You could tell it was a older movie had some poor quality in some places of movie but overall a heart warming good christmas spirit movie !!! I was very pleased with the short time it took amazon to get it to me ! I had it within 3 days of ordering and i did standard shipping
2,Not What I Expected,"I was disappointed with this one...the storyline was okay, but I was surprised at the amount of foul language. It says ""not-rated"", so it's a little misleading. If you're particular about what your kids see these days, I'd skip this one. I would not consider it a good, ""family Christmas movie"". There are too many that are much better to fill that category. If you find it at a library or rent it for a night, you might want to see it, but it's not worth the selling price."
3,Keep on Truckin' this Christmas,"What a great story... Two brothers must find a common bond to bring joy to a town down on their luck. And we are not talking about the girl that they both love.When it comes to Christmas movies, this is one of them. This movie warms my heart.Plus can you go wrong with a movie staring the guy who wrote, ""Joy To The World?"" Cause Jeremiah really was a bullfrog.The only sad thing about this movie is that there is no soundtrack on CD format."
4,Been looking for it for years.,"I actually saw this movie when it first came out. I was 14 years old. I've been trying to remember the name and find it ever since. I'm now 31 and just found and ordered it, I can't wait for it to come. I remember it as being a wonderfully touching movie about two brothers at odds with one another. A movie that shows how people who really love one another can put aside their differences and come together. Once again this are just what I remember from watching this movie more than 15 years ago, I can't wait to get it!!!"
1,Awful,This has got to be one of THE WORST Christmas movies of all time. Not a lot of happy stuff in it and doesn't get you into the holiday mood. It does have a 'happy ending' as you'd expect from a Christmas movie but really it is not worth the time to watch it. I actually threw it away after I watched it as I knew I would never watch it again!
2,"OK, but not necessarily family material.","This movie had a fairly good plot. However, it is not necessarily good for the whole family. There are a lot of swear words, and there is one off color joke which was totally unnecessary. Ray is a total jerk throughout the whole movie. I just felt sort of flat at the end as I don't feel it resolved things very well. Could have been good if it they had developed the story line a bit."
3,Not for Family,"This would have been a good movie.It had a nice story line with a good ending.It taught some good lessons about Family,forgiveness,and making something of your life.But with all the swear words, barroom scene and a off-color joke, it wasn't good for family and it took away from the goodness. I won't be watching it again."
4,John Schneider Christmas story,The dvd was a great story and my daughter will watch anything that John Schneider is in. This is a nice family movie.
3,Christmas Past!,"I bought this movie simply because it sounded interesting. It was an okay Christmas. Not going to be one that I watch every year but, okay."
4,Remembering past Christmas movies,"I have started collecting the movies we watched as our kids grew up. This was a movie that my son liked. (It had the Duke Boys in it and a semi truck.) The movie does have a good story. It deals with family problems and how they overcame their issues, along with helping others."
5,John and Tom Reunited In A Great Family Film!,"This movie is great for the family. There is a little bad language in it if I recall correctly but it's still a great movie, nevertheless. It was the first time John and Tom were working together since the ""Dukes"". I purchased it and would definetly recommend others to do the same!"
2,Dissappointed.,I have used this type of opener before and had great results.This one does not work on all types of jars.
4,they switched to initio chip,they are now shipping w/ a initio firewire chip. I have not found anything bad written anywhere about this chip. Someone on some forum noted that he called macally (they also use this chip I guess) and macally had run tests to confirm that the initio chip ran well.Anyways it has initio now not oxford. Oxford has such a good reputation and is a more expensive chip than initio. . .
1,PURE RIP-OFF ! !,"Amazon.com and five other companies advertised this product through BizRate's Web site as a 400GB external Hard Drive Combo!!! I fell for it and all I got was an empty plastic box that had a sticker on it that said hard drive sold separately!! The box is just a kit with connectors, a fan, and a cover for a hard drive...not worth $68.00. I'm sure this review won't be posted!!"
2,Deja Vu all over again,"Basically a rehash of other books he has written(the others are a rehash of each other). Of some value if you have not read the others. If you have, dont waste time or money."
4,Good but pricey flavored tea,This is my preferred flavor over plain lemon and raspberry ginseng. The sale price made it worth the purchase.
5,Love Green Eggs N Ham,Classic Dr. Seuss - excellent purchase for my growing teens who sometimes like to re-capture youthful events with mom.
4,"Great Stories, marred by forced commercials","I would have given this DVD 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that you are forced to watch (or fast forward through) several commercials before you get to the DVD menu. There is no way to jump directly to the menu. This is highly irritating, and Universal should be aware that it doesn't make me want to buy any more of their DVD's. However, the Dr. Seuss stories are still fabulous, of course."
5,Dr. Seuss - Green Eggs and Ham and Other Favorites,"The movie never changes it has always been good. But most inportant, the price was right, and the service was great."
4,Thought provoking,"Read this book originally in the late 70's and have reread it many times since up to just the past weekend (June, 2004) It's a mixture of mysticism, science fiction, etc that makes you think and re-evaluate your beliefs."
4,2150 A.D.,"This book is a wonderfully refreshing look at spirituality, and the possibilities that lie within each of us. I particularly enjoyed and have felt freed by the non-judgemental philosophy depicted. I have a request. Does anyone out there know where I can get a copy of the original edition? The later edition had some significant changes and I am really interested in reading again the original. If you know of a copy, e-mail me at flaskows@mail.sandi.net. Thanks."
1,One of the most worthless books I have ever plowed through.,"I make it a point to finish reading every book I start. This one was a chore. The only reason I can see that any informed person would want to read this book, would be if they have read/absorbed everything else in the New Age sci-fi genre"
4,Take a chance on this book,"While the basic story can be defined as fiction, the underlying message rang so true to me. If you are willing to suspend belief and take a chance on this book, I believe you will find it to be a story and way of thinking that will stay with you for a long time"
5,Macro Living for Micro Man,"This book has changed my life time and time again. Each time I read it, I learn something new about opening your mind or ""expanding macro awareness"". When I first read it a few years ago, I didn't believe the recommendation from my friend. He told me ""This book will change your life"". He was right. If you can get your hands on a copy, read it! It has a bit of a slow start, but after a chapter or two you just can't simply put it down without it popping into your thoughts again and again. It is a good one to read more than once because it has a lot of good info that could be missed the first time & it has a great sci-fi spin!"
5,Far reaching ideas for society,This is a superb book. I owned this book in the 1970's and am impressed by the Macro concepts spoken of. I would hope this society could come into being by 2150A.D.
1,Makes me horribly nauseated even with food,"I hate these vitamins, I do not have a sensitive stomach at all and these vitamins make me horribly nauseated! I actually threw up in the kitchen sink it hit me so hard and fast. Tried again a couple days later, same thing. Tried again after a couple of weeks and same thing! Will not ever buy these again. Very disapointed as I had high hopes."
3,"A little good, a little not so good","First, the bad news first. It made me nauseated and sick to my stomach about 10 minutes after taking it. Not a nice feeling to start your day!But, after it passed, I felt great. Energetic, alert. It was a noticeable difference in my mood and energy levels. And I'm someone whom is very sluggish and beat so it's definitely worth it.So mixed bag on this one.Good luck and Best wishes to you all!"
1,Causes Vomiting,"Same result as another reviewer. My wife tried this a few times and got violently nauseous. I thought she was just crazy, but then I just tried one this morning. 10 minutes later I was in the bathroom throwing up. Something is wrong with this product."
1,do not buy,"this multivitamin makes me vomit. i have been taking ""one a day"" for several years, also centrum and some supplements. none of them ever made me sick. this one, no matter if i eat before i take it, or not, if i take it while i'm eating, or a little bit after, it always always makes me sick. it's terrible. i went online to look at some reviews to see if i'm alone in this, and i am not. google it and you'll find other reviews with the same problem. makes me wonder what they put in this one...."
5,Great Boost,I like these vitamins. I can really feel the difference in energy on days where I forget to take them.
4,bought for mood swings,I was having issues with it being close to the time of month and feeling like I just want to scream and cry at people because I was getting to be so irritable just by little things. I asked a friend what I should try for mood swings and she suggested this. I have been taking it for close to a month and it seems to be working. I am not as moody as I used to be. I have not felt naseous taking this. I try to eat something first and then take it. Also these pills are big so if you have trouble swallowing big pills I would recommend that that you break it in half. I usually find myself having to swallow alot of water. Overall I think its a good buy but I haven't really noticed my energy level increase though. I will continue to take them to see if I notice any other positive effects.
1,DO not ever buy this,Vomits as just like everyone said. I had brought women's one a day vitmain (the other kinds) and I thought this one would be the same but improve with Active Mind and Body. I ate lunch and took this vitamin one hour later.. I vomited! NOW I feeling sick but not as flu-alike. DO NOT TAKE ANY OF THIS VITMAIN IF I WERE YOU. Stay away from this one!!!!
1,Made me very ill,"I hadn't read any reviews before I tried this product but I have had the same problem with it making me vomit within minutes after taking it. I had tried the One a Day Weight Sense and had a similar problem with it making me nauseous but it never actually made me vomit like this one. In fact, my stomach was so upset that I didn't feel safe eating for the better part of the day. About 2 1/2 hours after getting ill I ate an apple and managed to not get sick again but my stomach was still churning. I definitely won't be trying this again."
2,Good with the Bad,Ordered 2 bottles of the One-a-day Women's multi after finding them rated one of the best multis for women...but got extremely sick to my stomach almost 10 minutes after taking it with my other morning pills. Was not used to having to eat with their consumption as I've used a powder vitamin from Vitamin World for years (has unfortunately been discontinued). Won't make this mistake again. MAKE SURE you eat something when you take it.
4,It sure has got me lovin' their music!!,"I first heard the title track ""Fireproof"" on the radio, so I shortly after that bought the CD. I love it. I would say that my definate favorites are ""A Shame,"" ""Fireproof"" and ""Echelon"", although I also like that Stay Up song and Light at my feet. I haven't really heard their earlier stuff from the ""Above"" album, but since I love their music now, I think I'll give it a try!!<Vapor>"
5,Re-release of Pillar's second album,I actually owned the original Fireproof album back when the band was on Flicker Records before signing to MCA Records to re-release Fireproof on that record label. It was my first time buying a Pillar album and I heard their song Firefproof at a christian store and had to buy this album. I wasn't disappointed by what I heard but the original Fireproof album is alot different than the major label version. Fireproof has been mixed by the producer of Godsmack's records so its more hard and heavy and the album booklet is alot better and even features there new drummer Lester(there previous drummer Brad Noone left) but he isn't on the record as Brad is. Its actually an awesome record to own and shows that Pillar was matured since Above as it makes alot of references about being a Christian and living your life for God. If you like POD then you'll love Pillar.
5,Awsome young men with solid convictions,"These young men give solid proof that you can be yourself and still love Christ. From the dreads to the tattoos and piercings and the sweet hard rock, their music reaches out to anyone that loves good hard rock. Each song from Fireproof to Shame reaches out and touches you. The beats are contagious and this new release brings out the best of an already great cd. The dvd is an interesting peek into the concerts Pillar has presented. Pillar is ready to explode into the mainstream music sceen and take their place next to the all the greats."
5,PILLAR WILL ROCK YOUR WORLD,"Pillar is the definition of modern, vold rock music. Fireproof is an in-your-face decleration that they will never bow down to false gods (furnace story). Excellent stuff. If you don't get this, you're missing out."
4,"Catchy songs, nice DVD, watch out.. here comes Pillar!","I liked the first release of Fireproof on Flicker Records, but this one is a touch nicer. Remixed and some nice touches make the songs sound fuller and pack more of a punch. True fans will be happy to see that all the songs are virtually the same as far as the whole sound goes, and that the message is still intact.Being around the Cincinnati area, I'm glad to see that WEBN has added it, would love to know what all those FROG heads think about the words: ""I extol the Almighty.""Peace."
1,pillar review (band in General,"Even though Pillar is an alternative christian band, it is NOT metal. nor is it good. The Best way to describe this terribly generic band is boring, dull, and way to simple.However there ARE some great alternative christian bands out there.Here is a list of christian bands that will better your music collection for the better. (in no specific order)1.BLINDSIDE2.Thrice3.The Showbread4.Pedro The Lion5.He is Legend6.Brave Saint Saturn7.Chevelle8.Underoath9.Me Without You10.Becoming The Archetype (for you power metal fans)If You still enjoy Pillar im sorry if i offended you but im just telling you that there are more talented bands out there then the ones who play at Aquire The Fire and Creation. Also check out endeavor form seattle. on www.purevolume.com or www.myspace.com"
2,Pillar = Christian Linkin Park,"This is my sincere opinion, and actually I would rank meteora similiarly (3 stars), because both feature catchy (not deep) tunes, and lyrics that don't require a second's thought to interpret. I will always listen to Linkin Park instead, because I prefer rehashed teenage angst to preaching."
2,Pillar Fireproof remix,"I am a huge fan of Pillar, so when I heard that they released a remix of their Fireproof album I immediately bought it. Now I am not so sure I should have. I am afraid that I am somewhat dissapointed by this cd. I noticed very few changes to the songs, but the changes are there though, even if it might only be a few extra words here and there. The biggest difference is that they changed the order that the songs play in. And as for the dvd, it is just ok. The quality of their music during the concerts they show you is really poor. If I had heard them in a concert I would have never bought their cds. The interview type thing on it isnt too bad, but to put it frankly I feel that I wasted some hard earned money on this cd. Don't get me wrong, I love Pillar and I still think this cd is great, but if you are short of cash you might not want to buy this one unless you are a hard-core fan. Oh ya, on the bright side their new cover is pretty cool, so is the symbol on the cd and dvd."
4,"This album is ""Stinkproof""","I had a little hesitation on the 2nd album. I had the slightest doubt that we were going to get a clone of the first album. I can say without a doubt that the only similarities that this album has to the first one is a zeal for God and great production values. This boys took the rock,rap, and melody meter and threw it out the window. I did hear a little POD sounding kind of stuff which is why I only gave them 4 out of 5, but I'm convinced that these guys are definitly missionary minded and want to encourage new and old believers alike with tunes that will challenge Christians everywhere. Great stuff guys. I haven't stopped playing the album yet."
5,great cd,"Probably their best cd. Stay's close in sound to secular music. Older cd, but worth the buy."
5,Freak from the Underground,"This is the best rock cd there is from the best rock Band there is. Every song has great meaning. The Lyrics are very catchy, you will be singing them all day. Fireproof is deffenatly a cd you do not want to leave out of your collection. For more information about Pillar go to pillarmusic.com also be watching for their remix cd out june 10th."
5,This CD Blows my MIND!!,"For months Ive been looking for a christian band that rocks like this. Ive purchased Cd after Cd and nothing...At last!! I purchased this one. OH MAN!! They know how to do it. The energy is just amazing! The lyrics are just as great as other christian bands but the difference is the phat beat!, awesome guitar work. You have to get this CD. This is the Cd in which I will now judge all others. Thanks"
2,Too Copycat!,The CD was ok but it sounded a little too much like P.O.D. for my taste. It's not very original but it is somewhat fun to listen to. I don't regret buying the albumn but there is better out there.
5,One of the best Rock CD's ever,"Pillar's mainstream debut, Fireproof, has turned out to be one of the best rock albums ever. I recommend seeing them live as well.Just awesome!"
5,INCUBUS JUST GOT BEAT!!!,"WOW!! This C.D. is just plain AWESOME! The lyrics are right on too! They speak of living the life of a christian, to changing your life for Christ!The musical talent has increased too. Brad continues to rock with his double kick, Kalel has upped his bass that in some songs compares to Primus, and Noah has made the guitars even better. Buy the C.D.! It is the best...support the men!"
3,Good but not great!!!,"If u like P.O.D. or other such christian rapcore bands this is another great example of how just even a few good songs can make a decent cd, although not every track is great the title track as well as a few others make this a good buy!!!"
2,no detail on DOM and XSLT makes this a weak book,"In my opinion, the most important tools for building XML applications are DOM and XSLT. This book covers neither of them. It only covers SAX and CSS which are poor substitutes. While SAX has some advantages over DOM, it does not help with outputting new XML which is a common need."
3,"Technical Overview OK, Communication Poor","I bought ""Building XML Applications"" expecting a ractical hands-on approach, a demonstration of XML capabilities by way of actual examples. And while I found the book to be, in general, technically useful, the book is weighed down by a writting style that is, at best, verbose and redundant. There is so much of this stylistic padding that it becomes rather tedious to get past the crud. I understand writers sometimes get paid by volume, but if you have nothing to say, say it! Overall, a good source book (as long as you don't try to actually read it)."
2,Weak Application prototypes,"The book explains, as other XML books do, the basics of XML. Discussion in this book is mainly focused on how to use SAX parser to read XML data and there is no discussion on DOM. The contents, specifically the examples in the book are not really helpful to ""build"" applications but understand how one might use a SAX parser to parse an XML document.A good ""101"" book for someone trying to understand how to use Java and XML."
5,This song ROCKS!,When I hear this song at a club I can't just help but dance! This is the ultimate dance song for people who love to have fun and let loose!
5,Funky Techno with a Retro Flava,"I was first introduced to this song was when I was watching season one of the showtime series Queer As Folk. In episode 18 Scene 5, Brian Kenny enters the bathhouse looking for a little action, and ends up unexpectedly running into Dr Dave(Michael Novatney's beau) Uh oh!.. Will Brian tell his best Friend Michael that Dr Dave is being unfaithful? Or will Dr Dave come clean? The song is a perfect for this particular scene, and had me wanting to know who sang it."
4,Noodle away,"Bilger calls himself a gonzo journalist, and it may take just that type of writer from the fringes to head out in search of folks who eat squirrel brains or play rolley hole (a marbles game). Yet he proves greatly sympathetic to his subjects (more so than gonzo god Hunter S. Thompson, for example). In the hands of a Faulkner or a Flannery O'Connor, the tales of bullfrog farmers and coon hunters might have become Southern gothic grotesqueries. But Bilger paints them in vividly human colors in ways that might even make you want to go noodling for flatheads (a most unique method of catching catfish). This is a fun look at the lives of people we rarely encounter."
4,"Noodling for Flatheads: Moonshine, Monster Catfish, and Other Southern Comforts",I enjoyed the Chapter on cock fighting. That one chapter made the book for me. For someone who has a passion and interest in Southern redneck arts and passions this book is a recommended read. The remnants of a backwoods culture come to life in vivid form.
2,"Bad design makes it inconvenient, but it does sort of work","1. The push-button switch will get turned on when it's in your bag. It should have been made with a slide-switch.2. The spray nozzle is behind the fan blade, and when the fan is stopped it is usually covering the nozzle. (The nozzle should have been positioned lower so the fan blade can't interfere with it.)3. Why is the screw-off lid on the bottom? Why not make it more like a regular spray bottle where the nozzle and fan come off with the lid, and the bottom is just a standard bottle?"
1,was broken,"bought it to use at burning man and was looking forward to it, but when i popped batteries in there it never worked. very disappointed."
1,Disappointed,"With the hot summer we've been facing I thought this would be the perfect product to cool my boys off during their soccer games. At almost $9 it seemed a little expensive for a spray bottle and fan but it's a niche product and the price wasn't outrageous.We took it to the first soccer game and it wouldn't spray. The fan would turn on but without the water it didn't have the desired effect. Then the switch to turn the fan on/off broke and we couldn't even turn the fan on.Of course, we had already tossed the box because it my mind ""how hard is it to make a spray bottle with a pump?"". Returning it would be more trouble/cost than it's worth since I'd need to find a container to send it.To sum up: Highly disappointed in this piece of junk product."
2,Not great,We bought these for a hot trip to Disney thinking they'd help ...but they are cheaply made and the fan does not offer much breeze. The spray part of the bottle is great...but you are better to just get a squirt gun.........I would not recommend...
1,All around Poor Product,"Although the fan spins rather fast it produces almost no breeze. And the spray bottle is not a mist, rather a fairly concentrated stream. The effect is the same as if the fan were not even on and I just squirted myself in the face. Kind of defeats the whole purpose. A very poor product that I won't get any use out of. Also the bottle leaks and the battery compartment won't stay closed."
1,Don't buy this,"We bought several in preparation for a trip to Disney World. One broke upon first use as the nozel fell out. The other two are working, but the water is leaking. Also, the battery compartment is flimsy and likes to pop open."
5,Just Too Cool,"I just moved to North Carolina where the summers are supposed to be oppresive. I just love the O2 cool, it is great on a hot day of golf,I didn't break a sweat."
1,Complete junk,"These O2 Cool fans are complete junk. Two years in a row now, we've purchased these fans for our two kids to use at summer camp. Both years, the fans have quit working after 2 to 3 days of light use while still on the first set of batteries. After 2 summers and 4 failures, we will not be purchasing these fans in the future. If only zero stars was an option."
1,I agree - Don't Waste Your Money,Bought this for our trip to Disney. Luckily I tried it before we left. The mister didn't work properly and actually sprayed backwards! Returned it and the second one fan fell off! Don't waste your money!
2,"Product was shipped quickly, but did not work","Everything about this spray fan was as advertised.... except the spray part. I'm sure the unit that we received was simply defective, but it was still very disappointing. Sending it back tomorrow."
1,Only worked once,"Just got the bottle, it worked about 10 minutes then stopped. My daughter goes to camp in 4 days now I have to try to find one locally. Junk!"
2,Just OK,"02COOL 8101 Water Misting Fan is just OK. Flimsy construction. Hope it holds up for a while. Ordered two, but only one arrived in working condition. The other unit was missing a part and had to be returned for a refund. First time that I had to return a product to Amazon, and the return process seems simple and very efficient. Now waiting to see how quickly my refund will be credited to my account."
2,Not very strong,"Although attractive, this fan was not very strong. For the price, I expected something that had more oomph. In the summer, I'm sure the water container part would be nice...but...you need a fan that delivers a solid breeze. This is not it."
1,The FAN worked well,"I agree with the others. This was definitely not worth the $9 I paid for it. The fan works fine, and the water didn't leak on mine, but the spray was a direct hard stream -- not a mist at all. Very annoying and defeats the purpose of the thing."
1,other options,"The kids thought this product would be so cool, but the sprayer stopped working almost immediately. The same company makes a small carabiner misting fan (about a third the price) that works better, is more portable and I like that it attaches to a beltloop. I'll stick with those, or a basic (cheap!) spray bottle ..."
2,Almost good,"I have no complaints aboout how the product works, it works great but I thought I was getting a blue one as shown in the picture. I ended up purchaing this item for my husband who is in Iraq becuz its so hot there and he ended up with a pink fan. The paper he recieved with it said color may vary.....umm ok. So that didnt work out as planned. I was disappointed in the company. The fan is great if you can pick your color tho."
5,Pleasently suprised,"I ordered three of these items after seeing people use similar ones at last years Bonnaroo (4-day music festival). The ones I had seen where rather cheap and I wondered how long they would hold together. The three that I purchased (when batteries were added) pumped out a great amount of air, and were of a better quality. Definitely a good buy for concert goers."
3,Does not work well,"The one sent to me does not work well at all. When I press the button, the fan doesn't work until I touch the plastic blades to get them spinning. I've tried changing the batteries several times. I won't bother returning b/c it will cost just as much to ship back as it cost to purchase!"
2,manuel powered for mist,Good workout for your hand. Only get mist if you keep squeezing the trigger. Not what I was hoping for. Expected continuous spray. Do not get that unless you pump fast.
3,Still Cooling it !,"I only have 1 complaint, I wish I had the choice in color, but other than that I really like my purchase"
1,Durability Issues,Installation difficult with provided tool. Have played only 10 rounds and half the spikes are worn to the point they need replacement. I would not recommend this product (Q-Fit).
4,Very beautiful music,"Actually this is a great CD. I tend to buy things very fast and without a lot of thought at the time. When I hear a beautiful song I will go and buy the CD immediately! Dumb, I know...I have many CDs that I probably shouldn't have purchased but I love music and I always consider money spent on CDs is always money well-spent!"
3,Meh,Not as interesting as I'd hoped. The descriptions aren't any more insightful than you'd find in an average Sun Sign book.
3,WARNING! Multi-Media CD,"Multi-media cd that is not loadable through I-tunes. You can convert the files to windows media files but that is about it. Pretty good cd, HEAVY Clash influence and I liked it even though I really only bought it for Riot Radio and Your Not the Law."
3,ok album,this album is okay if you like the clash and other bands like that. riot radio is a very intriguing single and probably the best song on the album. although they say they want to riot the radio they sound as if they want playing time more and will probably get it. buy only after you have heard a few songs just to make sure you like it.
1,Will not buy,I'm glad others mentioned the copy protection. I was going to buy this CD to check them out since they are touring with Social Distortion. Now I will not buy their CD or any merchandise at the concert. I listen to music exclusively through my PC or my OGG Player hooked up optically to my stereo. Guess the Dead 60s are not for me.
1,looks like another I won't get,it's not the music...it's the fact that I can't play it in my player of choice.Sorry Epic...you're one of those idiot studios that won't ever be getting my business again. I refuse to be told how I can use something that I OWN!Stay away from this CD...if for no other reason than buying it supports a studio who thinks they can control when/where/how you listen to their CDs.
3,1979 revisited and now safe to play in all computers.,"Definly right that this band sounds like Beat Crazy era Joe Jackson leading The Clash on this brand new debut from The Death 60s. And at times, during some of the songs there's also a Public Image 1979 without the herky jerky Johnny Lydon vocals. Lead single Riot Radio sounds has a Remain In Light era Talking Heads guitar. A Different Light leads off with Joy Divison-like bass. My favorite track is Nowhere, which could have been a outtake from Look Sharp! And try not to sing This Is Radio Clash to the start of Loaded Gun.In short this would have sound at home back in 1979, and The Death 60s have been influenced by the best of the New Wave and Punk bands of that era. This is a A- album. Finally now released without that XCP garbage, it's now safe to play in all computers.Catalog number (without XCP-82876-77675-2)XCP copy EK-94453"
3,The Dead 60's,"The Dead 60's is a somewhat misnamed band since they sound more like the Clash than anyone, and the Clash weren't around in the 1960's.They also have a striking resemblance to the Kaiser Chiefs. This cd doesn't really differentiate itself from a lot of similar-sounding music, be it new or old.The Dead 60's CD, though, is good music. It's good British retro-garage rock with hints of reggae/ska thrown in. I don't see how people could dislike the band.I'm sure both bands (K-Chiefs and Dead 60s) are very hip and cool to listen to nowadays, with this new retro-meets-modern approach to things. However, I wonder if these CD's will have any staying power like the Clash do.Did I think it's a good cd and enjoyable for the first listen? I guess so.But will I still be listening to this CD six months or a year from now? I doubt it."
1,DRM = Dangerous Rootkit Malware,Sony should be ashamed that PCs are infected shortly after playing this CD.Amazon should stop selling this CD immediately given the known damage that it causes to computers.
3,Pleasantly surprised,Have you ever saw a CD and bought it just because you thought the name or the cover looked cool? Well I have. I do this a lot actually. I buy CDs that are generally low priced without really knowing what the band sounds like.I bought The Dead 60's album without knowing what to expect. Would they be imitating the 60's sound? Or was it just a clever name? (I soon found out it was just a clever name) I personally love the sound of the CD. It's pretty up beat and just fun to listen to. Some people have compared them to The Clash and Franz Ferdinand and I guess they sound somewhat similar. The first couple of songs are quite short and later on in the CD some of the songs sound a bit repetitive. But other then that it's wonderful and I highly recommend it.I don't own an Ipod. So I don't see any reason to complain about the fact you can't put it on an Ipod. I'm sure there are ways to put The Dead 60s on your Ipod. They're just different ways then what you're use to.
2,Not good enough for iTunes?,"Good tunes, but not being allowed to put them onto iTunes? Sorry guys, but you're staying out of my collection.A solid 4.0 stars for the music, but you only get 2.0 because your label talked you into releasing a copy-protected CD. (I'm trusting this rookie mistake wasn't ALL your idea!)"
3,WARNING!,"There are some catchy tracks on this disc and I would very much like to recommend it, but I have to warn anybody who owns an IPOD: YOU CANNOT ADD THIS TO YOUR IPOD OR ITUNES! The powers that be must be idiots at Epic records. They have designed the cd to protect the copyright thus screwing over we the music lover. Purchase at your own risk."
3,Good CD,Where was the advertising for this CD...shame on Sony Music as if I hadn't been looking I probably wouldn't have run across this CD. I like Brad's smoky voice and there are a few really good songs. He is a talented writer and I really am looking forward to seeing what else this man will be bringing to the music scene.The music did seem a bit over produced and overpowered Brad's vocals on a few songs. I liked the songs Brad had a hand writing than the ones others had written.
4,Great album - even if you are not a big country music fan,"I'm not normally a big country music fan, but while surfing TV channels I came across Nashville Star and since my husband's job has him temporarily living in Nashville, I tuned in. I watched about the last three or four shows and found Brad Cotter to be especially enjoyable.This album has some great cuts including ""I Meant To"", ""I Miss Me"" and ""Rock and Roll in the Hay"". Clever lyrics and a great sexy voice make this worth listening to."
5,"Male Vocalist of the Year, Decade, and Century!!","If you're not a country fan, no worries. This guy will draw you in and make you a ""Brad"" fan before you realize what's happened. Brad has an awesome voice, with such versatility, that it's hard to categorize him into one genre."
2,Disappointed,"Very few CD's have disappointed me the way ""Patient Man"" did. I had great expectations for this CD. I expected an upbeat outing with lot's of country, rock, blues and even Motown influences. I got none of that. It seems that Brad is too exhausted to give anything but a bored, uninspired performance. It's as if he finally gets a big break, but is too tired to do anything about it. Given the opportunity to debut on Sony Records, I think he or his team would have put forth a more excited effort. With the notable exception of ""I Meant To"", this CD is made up entirely of B-sides. There are times when the music drowns the vocals, and some of the lyrics are sophomoric at best. I realize there was a rush to get this CD released, but couldn't they have come up with more than 10 songs? Maybe Brad is one of those performers who can only be captured live, because he was great on Nashville Star. I say hold off for George Canyon's debut."
5,Patient Man a great CD,This is a great cd for country fans and non country fans. Fans that do not care for country wlll also like this album. It is amazing that this album was made in three weeks. From all the serious life songs on the album to Rock and Roll in the Hay which is a fun catchy number which should be the next single. Great soulful voice and you get the extra thing of having somebody good to look at in his videos. Reminds me a lot of Kieth Urban. Brad cotter is going to be a star.
2,Bookcase,This bookcase came with several defects. The boards were discolored and they split when we screwed the pieces together. We were really disappointed.
5,Bull takes a shot a sci-fi and hits a bulls-eye.,"While Emma Bull is most noted for her fantasy, Falcon proves that she's got the chops to cut it as a fast paced science fiction author.Falcon has a few moments where the plot is confusing. But it never drags for a moment.If you're not already picking up this book to round out your collection, you should!"
3,Well written space opera,"Interesting plot and strong writing make this a fun novel for those who like space opera and those who don't. Good characters, good plot and some fun pseudo scientific gobldygook keeps you going through the whole thing. I thought the ending was weak, but read it anyway. Actually you should read everything by Emma Bull that you can find."
2,need more specific instructions,it has some good pictures and ideas but that's all. the instuctions if any are not good at all.dont spend your money on it.
2,Not Cold on Arrival,"This product was not cold on arrival like advertized--""with ice packs."" This product must be kept cold or it loses it's effectiveness. It also took more days to arrive to my home than advertized. I'm very disappointed."
3,Seems OK,"I am not sure how good this is. I am relatively healthy, so I did not notice anything or can report any improvement. It was shipped to me warm without cold packs as it is needed to keep it cold per Natren. So that may have something to do with it. I complained to the vendor, Vitamin Style, but got no response."
3,Conflicting issue with Holy Trinity,"Needing a probiotic I started researching to find out just what it is that makes up a quality probiotic. I came cross this article: [...] One of the criteria states that the different strains of healthy bacteria (e.g. acodophilus, fifidium, bulgaricus) should never be together in one capsule because the superior strain will kill-off the weaker strains. The author goes on in her article to state that only the Natren Brand follows the practice of keeping them separate. So I go to the Natren website to purchase *separate* strains and low and behold they sell the ""Holy Trinity"" which has the above 3 mentioned strains **TOGETHER**!!! Now I'm wondering how many of their other claims are true. I gave this a 3 star because I feel caught in the middle between Natren's advertising and this ""criteria"" article that shows a conflict with the product (which wasn't it intended purpose, but proved to be)."
4,Works,"Seems to work as described. However I suspect bottle to bottle or batch differences. My sisters bottles bought in California react much strongly than that which I just bought online. However, I am still satisfied."
5,Start of my day,I started taking Healthy Trinity - Natren about 1 year ago. I have definitely noticed a difference in my intestinal tract and for the first winter avoided any upper respiratory infections. Taking HT was recommended to me by a nurse in the hospital I work at and we both are true believers in this product.Amazon has the best process in purchasing this product for the best price. It is worth every penny.
3,"Great probiotic, but beware of shipping.","So, I read the other reviews, and knew to be aware of a potential shipping issue, but decided to risk it since it's twice the price at other retailers. Well, it arrived, on a 92 degree day, without any type of coolant in the packaging. So, I immediately called amazon. The CSR told me that it was fine because it didn't have to be refrigerated until it was opened. I then called Natren, just to get all the facts straight. At Natren they said, ""you are right, amazon is wrong, it does need to be refrigerated throughout the shipping process"". I called amazon again, and a much nicer CSR said that they would do something about it (by contacting the seller (?) not sure of the exact steps they were going to take to correct the issue). I have not checked to see, but this is an excellent price for an excellent product, and I'd love to be able to order again if it's refrigerated."
1,My Healthy Trinity DID NOT come packed in dry ice...,"From all of the feedback I have read, it seems that this product must come wrapped in dry ice. Also, I have read that whichever company Amazon uses to distribute Healthy Trinity DOES use dry ice. However, that was not the case with my shipment. Mine just arrived packed in Styrofoam popcorn...Shall I return it? WHAT IS THE DEFINITIVE ANSWER ON THE NECESSITY OF THE PRODUCT BEING PACKED IN DRY ICE??? WHICH DISTRIBUTOR, ASIDE FROM VERY EXPENSIVE NATREN, PACKS THE PRODUCT IN DRY ICE?"
2,healthy trinity,"Heard a lot of good comments about this product, im a long time sufferer from candidiasis So far I havent seen a difference between this one and other products on the market....Id say bio-k provides a more immediate relief"
1,Do not order from Green Web - product went bad before it arrived,"Green web sent me the bottle of Natren's Trinity late, by 5 days, even though I paid extra for overnight shipping. It finally arrived and was bad, it was in a brown box and wrapped in plastic bubble wrap, no refrigeration packaging. The product needs to be refrigerated or else it goes bad, and will not be potent. I needed to return it and get a new bottle of natren trinity and thought that they just made a mistake in packaging. When I contacted the seller Green Web they were really rude and said that they would charge me 15% restocking fee and would not return all of my purchase money. Amazon, thought that this was not fair either. I will never use this company again to buy ANYTHING! AMAZON GET THIS COMPANY OUT OF YOUR SITE!PLEASE!"
2,DOES NOT COME COLD!!!,"So, the big deal is that this is suppose to be kept cold, right? NOT!! I bought this from Amazon and noted that there was some delay in handling which made me worry. Then it finally arrives days past when expected and there it is. In a box, no cold packs, no nothing.Now, if it works I'll happily write about that but for now am seriously disappointed and glad I didn't pay for the larger size. I feel ripped off already but hopefully how the product works will change that."
2,Too small,Thought I was getting several sizes. Only received the tiny one. useless for my needsSusan
4,2D EXTREME SHOOTER!,"THIS GAME FEATURES HUGE BOSS BATTLES, INTENSE 2 PLAYER ACTION, AND INSANE LEVELS! THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR SHOOTER FANS!"
1,I really don't know how to respond,"Well the two singers came to our school today(LMH GO BLAZERS!). I don't know if some appreciate this music but i sure as heck don't. I really don't think they can sing all that well and their songs are too ""Tree Hugger"" for me. The only song i somewhat liked was the song about the amish school shooting because i live close to that area. But even then i really don't like their voices."
2,Of Archival Interest Only,"As a big fan of The Velvet Underground and Lou Reed's '70s solo work I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this DVD. The video quality ranges from bad in the first segment to terrible in the second part. Audio quality is not much better and is only in stereo even though the case says there is a 5.1 mix. These shows were obviously recorded on magnetic tape which has greatly deteriorated over the years. I would only recommend this DVD to hardcore Lou Reed fans as the only positive aspects of it are seeing Lou during his ""Rock And Roll Animal"" incarnation and Steve Hunter's stellar guitar work."
1,Horrible waste of time and money!,"I would give this no stars if I could.This is so badly transferred from an old tape.The first segment is at least watchable.It gets much worse MUCH,MUCH worse.Is Lou even aware of this travesty?"
2,Audio and Video stink (bad),"I am a Lou Reed fan but this DVD needed to be cleaned up much better. It is almost unwatchable. Get the ""Live At Montrenx 2000"", and let this one slip by."
1,Downer,"i've bought dvd's from german tv shows in the past, so when I read this was recorded for tv in france and belgium I though it has to be a decent recording, big mistake worst of the worst, don't waste your money."
4,More than Goya,"Evan S. Connell's biography of Francisco Goya is more than that--it is a vast canvas of Europe in the second half of the 18th & first half of the 19th centuries with Goya's Spain and Napoleonic France as protagonists. Each character is introduced with plenty of detail and local color. Goya's paitings and drawings reflect not only his subjects' lives and loves but also his own rich and tormented (r)evolutionary process, from Fuedetodos to Madrid to his last days in Bordeaux. As an artist of the people, he strived to portray the truth beyond mere faces and events and succeeded to both please royalty and alienate reactionary Spanish traditionalists. Connell weaves quotes from previous biographers and art critics into his entertaining narration.I enjoyed this book and recommend it to all readers who were ever intrigued by Goya's inscrutable originality."
2,Don't know if I'll be able to finish it!,"I find the author's style extremely irritating. He seems to be one of those people who confuse an ironic, gossipy style with wit. I couldn't care less about the maid his family had when he was a child; I don't see that she had anything whatsoever to do with Josefa de Goya beyond the fact that they were both women. Nor do I see what the conquistadores had to do with Goya, for that matter. If there's nothing to tell about the subject at hand, don't add superfluous fluff to pad out the length. This is a deeply annoying book to read, and I don't know if I can even bring myself to finish it. I give it two stars only from what information can be refined from all the dross."
2,too much hearsay; learn to write Spanish properly,"I found this book full of hearsay and opinions from known bodys and no bodys. It does not focus on Goya but on the time when he lived. I would not categorize this as a book under History or Biography.Also, it was alarming how poorly the Spanish phrases were written. Even though the author says he has spent 1/2 year in Barcelona, where mainly two languages are spoken, it is not enough to assume he has mastered the few phrases he throws here and there, specially if they are going to be written in a book accessible to the public. I was surprised the editor did not get a translator to review the inserts in Spanish. Not only is the capitalization wrong in a lot of the phrases but also there are some signs of poor translation and/or usage. I guess the author did not do his homework well, to find out how names are written and used. I also noticed some incorrect ""facts"" which made me think I was waisting my time with this book."
1,Pieces fit anywhere,The pieces of this puzzle fit in the wrong places. My daughter is just learning puzzling and it's very confusing to her! Terrible design. Melissa and Doug need to product test this with a toddler. How can she learn to match the right pictures when they all fit together??
3,Moderately Entertaining and Enlightening,"This one hour ""special"" that originally aired on PBS in 2005 is adequately produced and gives the viewer some interesting information about the history of ""burying grounds"" in the US. Beautiful and historic cemeteries including Mt. Auburn in Boston, Oakland in Atlanta and Lakeview in Cleveland are given special prominence. An unusual cemetery in Vermont containing many beautiful granite monuments made from native stone is also one of the more memorable features. Cemeteries in suburban San Francisco, Waterloo, New York, Key West, Florida and Fairbanks, Alaska are included. This is not a sad, morbid or spooky film at all and it even has touches of humor. Encouragement of preservation of cemeteries for their beauty, history and cultural significance is a major theme as is the advantages of using these often lovely places for activities far removed from funerals."
1,boring,"My 9 year old daughter had to read this book for school and thought it ""wasn't that exciting"" and didn't really like it."
1,Dull; lacks action,"This story of an African-American girl whose problem is a refusal to get mad is more like a series of somewhat idealized vignettes of inner-city African-American family and school life with a very modest underpinning of plot. ""Koya Delaney"" was one of six books assigned for Book Bowl reading in my children's own inner-city school. It's the only one I didn't find engaging. It's possible that some girls might really like it, but for the rest of us, it's a wash."
5,Pretty Good,This little mp3 player has eq and bass and treble controls plus hidden controls for contrast and the back light. it sounds very good with my titanium driver headphones from radio shack. it has lots of bass and great highs. it has very good controls.
1,One size fits none,"Don't waste your time. Cheaply made. The crown of the hat was much too tight; the adjustable strap was irrelevent. Because of the shipping fees I didn't even bother to try and return them, just threw them out."
2,Didn't like the hat.,"Was looking for a plain black fitted hat. Most, if not all of the logo hats I get are fitted I assumed this would be the same. Don't know who wears non-fitted hats these days. Oh well, I'll keep trying and toss this one."
3,An introduction to automatic identification technology,"Kevin Sharp has detailed the ins and outs of automatic identification. He covers the prevalent technologies including: bar codes, vision systems, voice recognition, magnetic stripes, and touch screens. In addition, he explains application of the technology to a variety of areas: manufacturing, asset management, health care, and document tracking. This book will provide the interested reader with an introduction to automatic identification technology. However, it is somewhat dated. It does not include the newer biometric identification technologies."
5,S'good stuff,"This Jalapeno Mustard became hard to find locally, so I had to order it by the case of 6. Well worth it, because it's a great, versatile product. We love using it in our potato salad as it adds just a little zip to anything you add it to. It tastes like typical yellow mustard but with a kick of jalapeno. We don't find it too spicy though, just right."
5,Woeber's Sandwich Pal Jalapeno Mustard,This Woeber's product is also very delicious. I bought three Woeber products and I like all three of them. They are very delicious and I am very happy with my purchase of all three.
1,buyer beware!!!,"Well, it to happen sometime. What I received was not what appeared as shown in the descriptive picture. I'd brought feather bed toppers before at chains (target, linens & things), so I knew what I did not want.I paid more for this different style feather bed topper, paid for shipping and waited.Today, I received my order. It is exactly the same product (including manufacturer's label) as sold locally in the chains. However, this topper appeared used: yellowed over large areas and having two small brown stains, ugh!! Adding insult to injury - featherbeds are non-returnable!! A cheated customer never returns."
2,Confusing description of product,"Please fix the product description , It says ""Classic Falcon VARIANT"" but the product sold by Amazon is not the VARIANT version. It also would be good to remove the customer image placed by Studio88 that creates the confusion, because that image refers to a different product not sold by Amazon."
3,Not what I was expecting,"This product is great if you just want an all over short haircut, I thought (which was my own fault when ordering it) that I would be able to cut different lengths with it, but you can't. So if you are looking for something for cutting different lenths of hair I don't recommend it."
4,Wahl Clippers,I have had Wahl Clippers for many years. I got this set to replace the one my son borrowed and never returned. My father was a barber for 54 years and got me my first set of Wahl Clippers. They are very dependable and are excellent for doing trim up work. I wish this set had a couple of heavier blade attachments. But it is an excellent value as is.
1,amazon customer no service,poor fulfillment of my order. i would not buy from amazon again. all three dvds i ordered were listed as in stock and should have been sent at the same time. that is not happening. i cannot review the dvd if they havent correctly fulfilled the order. the three dvds were ordered as a birthday present.next time i will try walmart and see if they are any better. i cannot easily find a way to complain to amazon so i guess this is the place to post my disappointment with amazon and say i will not order from them again.
3,"Older, and not free","Chapter 1 of this book is a short and nice introduction to C# for programming language experts. However, the following chapters are not easy to understand even for experts. You can download a newer version of ""C# Language Specification"" (a standard from ECMA but whose content is mostly the same as this book) free. Do you still want to buy this book?"
5,An Advanced C#,"This is a ""Collector's Edition"" of the C# specification, that I believe is freely available on the Internet. The value in this book is that it is very nicely bounded and perfect for a software engineer's library. Also, the annotations provided by Anders Hejlsberg, et. al. are illuminating and thought provoking. While you could just print this out on your printer, I think this book is valuable for saving you time and being more durable.The spec is also very well written and understandable to experienced C# developers. If you want to be an expert on C#, I think this book will put you in a very good position to do so."
2,be careful you know what you are getting,"OK, OK, maybe my mistake. But looking at the titles and the reviews I ""bought"" this book on-line at Safari. Should have been more cautious and if I was in the book store I would have noticed that this book is _just_ about the language - not how to use it, not the libraries, just the language. Not sure how this is useful. Certainly not for me. If this book is what you really want - just a language specification, then it is probably good. I stopped reading when I realized the mistake I had made."
4,c# from the source,"this book covers c# in detail, and its straight from the source; the people who defined the language. It gets a little textbook-y at times, but its quite informative nonetheless."
2,Useless for most programmers,"The book covers the C# language in a rather abstract formal way, with great detail. I was very dissappointed because it lacks examples and it does not provide any reference to the .NET framework. Into my opinion C# is a useless language to wrtie applications without a proper framework."
4,"C# language, pure and simple",One thing very obviously missing from the chapter on Exceptions is a discussion on writing custom exceptions. Otherwise a very well written book for a very very reasonable price.
3,Solid reference but nothing more,"The first chapter of the book gives a brief and interesting introduction into C#. The rest of the book is truly only a technical reference. Even four seasoned Programmers this book is not useful for learning unless you like reading specs. Stroustroup managed to do a much better job in documenting C++ with ""The C++ Programming Language"" (even though he was not as complete as this book about C#).If you know C# by heart and need a spec for the gory details, go and buy this book. If you have only a rough knowledge and want to get a good knowledge, look for another one."
3,fast wearing spike,If you walk 18 holes a couple of times a week these spikes will need to be replaced in 6 months. Their period of effectiveness usually is 3 - 4 months
4,Wobble board,Challenging exercise. It will take time to get the hang of it. But definitely works to improve your balance. The board does well in handling large and small people.
2,Flimsy,Didn't quite work out on my carpet... rolling chair left indentations in the mat... it never sat flat... would have preferred a stiffer plastic.
5,Power Trio Triumphs!,"Aficionados of power lead guitar will not be disappointed with yet another live offering of G3, this time featuring what could be its most powerful and complementary iteration in Joe, Steve and John Petrucci. Petrucci's playing is simply wonderful, one of the few guys I know that can sweep pick and shred with the best, yet also knows how to bend a wire and produce a melody you can actually whistle along with...to wit, his infectious ""Glasgow Kiss"" track. Steve, the Jimi of our time, is his usual playful self and sounds more inspired than ever on this live album. Joe simply rules, especially with his weird, trance-inducing Doors-ian tune in ""D"" that precedes a chugging, kick-arse Up in Flames - his most powerful adrenalin-rush since Summer Song. The boys come together at the end with a classic rock setlist replete with jaw-dropping fretboard acrobatics. Highly recommend purchasing the DVD as a companion to this instant live classic!"
3,"Really, it's a 3.5","Overall, it's not a bad book.Kerner overuse fantasy cliches, but not too many, so that it takes away the overall effectiveness of the book. The decriptions are really good, and the pages fly by.The biggest downfall, for me, was the character jumps - that just irritates me - and it's in the first person. I don't like books written in the first person, it makes for a restricted story, I want an outside perspective looking in on the story.But still, I recomend it, if you have nothing else on you bookshelf."
5,A romantic fable that any dragon fan is sure to treasure.,"This book has everything: adventure, romance, tragedy and comedy. I loved it. I never thought I would enjoy anything as much as I did Anne McCaffrey's ""Dragon Riders of Pern"" series. I was wrong. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the four hundred ""lost ones"" remain trapped and Lanen never makes it to warn her mother. What gives? Is the Author planning a sequel? Oh please tell me she is, because she wrote one hell of a cliffhanger. Sincerely, Alishia Powell Florida,USA"
5,At long last!,"Elizabeth Kerner, I welcome you into the field of Fantasy. This book is one of the best I have ever read. It's so good that I'm going to do something I've never done before. I'm going to dare to compare this wonderful novel to the works of Tolkien. And with good reason. Kerner has achieved something truly unique in these books. The dragons are amazing, Lanen Kaelar even more so, and the writing better than any of those.Kerner brings a fresh mind to Fantasy, and it shows. Her work is new and bright, like the Soul Gems of her dragons. I had not realized till now how pathetic most of the fantasy I read is. I only hope that Kerner can keep this up through more books.Kerner, I wish you the best of luck, and I'd like to thank you for this fabulous book. May the wind always be at your back, may you always be able to fly."
5,Great book!!!!,"I loved Akhor and Lanen, they were so beautiful together! It was a great book! I read it almost every day. I love reading about dragons, but this is indefinitely the ultimate best! I can't wait for sequels!"
5,More than 5!,Lanen is a young girl who wishes to explore the land outside of her cruel fathers farm and dreams of dragons but to her father she is only a foolish girl good for work.Then suddenly her father dies and she inherits enough money. with her mind made up Lanen sets off to explore but she soon is a part of a wild journey after finding out the real truth to who she is...........................Wow! this is all I can say for this book. It was so thrilling I read it all in 2 days........at some parts in the book you can actually relate to Lanen which makes the book and hero even more awesome...and it was in a sense different from many fantasy books........I think it really had more emotion in the writing...and that is why people enjoyed reading this book
4,A really different dragon story,Unusual plotline which is interesting. Good reading. Strong female characters.
3,Excellent characters! Good story line.,Great book. Main characters are charming. The story line is not finished by the end of the book. I expect a sequel out soon. The book seemed to echo my own childhood wishes and fantasies.
4,Entertaining,I'd like to say that this book has all the elements of a good fantasy. And the love between Dragon and Gedri is amazing. This book is a must read. :)
1,Dullest Book I've Ever Read!,"As I read reviews posted by other readers, I wonder if they even read the same book I did! Each time I set it down, I had to force myself to pick it up again, just because I really hate to leave a book unfinished. The characters are wooden caricatures, the dialogue is unrealistic and just dreadful, and the whole story is flat and dull. I could not more strongly urge you to find something else, ANYTHING else (the ingredient list on the back of a shampoo bottle, for instance), to read... but I'm obviously in the minority here."
2,"Dull, dull, dull","This book was SO boring I could not even finish it, and I am the mother of a young child who is starved for input. Lanen Kaelar is a virtuous lump and her dragon friend is too, although his coloring seems more interesting. And who cares if they defeat evil or not? Derivative, dull, not worth your time."
1,What a sappy romance!,"All right, I delved into this story with high expectations, what with all the good ratings. However, what I found was one very gushy, abstract story. The plot was extremely weak and easily predictable--other than Lanen going to the Dragon Isle and falling in love with Akor, and getting her revenge on her father Marik, there wasn't much else. I saw the ending coming half-way through. I've never made such a bad choice in buying a fantasy novel! Save your money, folks!"
4,Great read in high style,"I thought this book was reminiscent of Mercedes Lackey or Robert Jordan or even Marion Zimmer Bradley. High marks for style and content and thoroughly entertaining from the first moment. Ms Kerner has a bright future and hopefully a prolific one. Don't bother her with mail, it will interupt her. Must read this if you like High fantasy."
5,"Beautiful, poetic writing style.",I loved this book and want the sequel now!! The characters are people you can care about and relate to and I found Kerner's writing style very poetic and evocative.
2,could have been better,This was a good book but not a Great book. I would have liked it more if it did not go from character to character so much. I also did not like the fact that it was written as if it had already happened not as if it was happening as you are reading. The problem I had with it being written as her memory is that she makes little comments thought the book that make me feel like I am reading a history book and not the most interesting one. I also thought that she seemed to go from one place to another without doing any travel. There is no day to day life in the book it is simply the story part with no life. It says that she is going somewhere and how but it does not really tell much of how she got there. I think that how they get to places is half the fun of reading an adventure.
5,Great deal for a movie of this caliber,For a small budget film the quality is of a higher production level. This group of people that put this together are going to be one of the most priemer groups in the film industry soon. I would say its a must buy.
5,Blurb from the back cover,"'Peter Candler is an attentive, passionate, and ingenious reader of masterworks in Christian theology. Correcting the standard histories, posing constructive questions to prevailing prejudices, he restores the memory of theologians who became eloquent just because they wanted to teach -- and to contemplate.'Mark D. Jordan-- Emory University"
3,Decent product,"Packaging was damaged. Some parts were missing. Had to make two trips to the local hardware store. Assembly instructions are useless. Once installed, the fixture looks nice, clean, modern. That is the saving grace"
1,Doesn't match pictured item,The item received is lower quality than the one in the photo. The item received does not include the mounting screw which leave you at the mercy of the single plastic prong on the bottom outlet to hold the adapter in place. Not recommended.
3,"Good idea, one problem","Good idea, works well, as advertised, it's low profile is terrific. It's like similar products, advantage is thin design & the plug placement that allows it to hug the wall (Bed Bath & Beyond has one, but not as skinny as this) There is one 3-prong plug that goes into the wall, and 6 outlets. However, you cannot secure it into the outlet. Instead, a small, plastic, single prong is inserted into the unused 2nd wall outlet to hold it in place & that broke off after plugging in a 2nd device. This doesn't effect performance however, all 6 outlets still function & it seems to be staying in place at this time-3 weeks after installation, with lamps permanently plugged in & occasionally a vacuum cleaner temporararily plugged in. 4 out of 5 stars."
3,It's ok,"You pay for what you get. Just remember that. It works for its intended usage but don't expect this to be high quality. I took one apart because it appears to not work with kitchen/bathroom safety outlets (space between plugs isn't far enough). With a little modifications I got it to work on one side only. Internal parts look cheap. Don't power your 1200 watt microwave with this thing. You will most likely melt the plastic off. This is made for light duty items only.Didn't come with a center hole screw. Looks like I have to go find one at my local hardware store.If I knew it was going to be this cheap construction, I would have looked for something better."
1,Very cheap,"1. I have a prime account, it is fulfilled by amazon, but was charged $4 for shipping.2. It is very hard to plug something in, and when it does plug in plug comes out very easily! Feels like something broke.3. No long screw to hold it into the wall. Double checked...it just isn't there."
5,Great Plug,These work great. Especially behind a bed or couch. I think I need one for every plus just because I like the look coming out from the sides instead of sticking out in front.
5,Solved a big problem,This Smart Plug was just what we needed to allow us to plug in our lamps and other devices into an outlet behind the sofa. Everything stays close to the wall so it is not in the way of the furniture.
5,Space Saver Multiplex Plug,"There is not much more to say than that they are exactly what I needed and solved a few huge problems in my home. I don't actually understand why they aren't all made this way. No more messy plugs sticking out into the room. I like these even in places where there is no furniture, but they are very hard to find. Thank you for being there for me."
2,Take care here....two DIFFERENT devices shown in pictures!,"There two VERY different devices shown in the photos. One has prongs for BOTH outlets and a screw to hold the device in place. The other has only ONE set of prongs, and no screw. The second one would NOT distribute the load, and would not tend to remain as firmly in place."
4,nice product,"This is a nice product; it just did not make as big a difference as I hoped. However, it is an improvement over normal plug ins."
4,Does what it says.,Perfect wall plug. Does what's described. It fits in the wall snugly. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because it didn't come with a wall screw to place it firmly in the wall socket.
3,"Basically average. Not too bad, but not too great.","I must say, F-1 Challenge is a pretty good game. The graphics are pretty reasonable, but control and handling of the vehicles sometimes isn't too good, and requires that you change the car settings.. The course selection is very reasonable, including Suzuka and Monaco, which are pretty well designed. Even though I think it's average, I still think that it's a good Formula 1 racing simulation to buy."
4,Made in India,"Just got it, I think it will make a good espresso because the Bialetti is a good name in the market. I am a little disappoint because it said made in Italy in Amazon but what I got is made in Indian. Cannot wait until tomorrow morning to make my first espresso. If the espresso is good, I will give it five star again even if it made in China.Love the shape and satin stainless steel."
4,One Step Ahead of the Blues,"Take a few deep breathes, re-fill your beverage, dim the lights, and press ""play.""This witty independent film is all about vibe. Set high in the Colorado Rockies in the late seventies, join Al Dean (Geoff Hanson) on his easy going journey to the promised land: the American Dream. If you like good music, beautiful scenery, and quality hair styles - buy this film.A great effort from the Hanson Brothers!"
3,Almost with 'ya,"Scrapple is indeed the best movie I've seen that captures ski bum life- and it has an awesome soundtrack. But the plot is stupid and the characters (especially the bad guys) are 2-dimensional. Worse though is that there is hardly any skiing! (just one short flashback- it takes place in summer). I'm sorry- you can not have the quintessential skibum movie without more skiing- or at least more time on the ski area or in the backcountry. The trick is to do it without it becoming ""Hot Dog"" or a Greg Stump movie. Anyone know a movie that does that?"
4,To file or not to file...,"A born pack-rat, whenever I was in doubt about what to keep and what to throw away, I kept it. But I've learned to streamline my files...without getting rid of any necessary files. The handbook is easy to understand, and is a good introduction to the filing system, but the real key is in the cards. The laminated cards for each section let you know what to file in that section, what NOT to file in that section (with suggestions on where to file these items), what to toss, and what to archive (and for how long). Whether you're just beginning to set up your files, or you have piles of paperwork, the HOMEFILE system can help. After spending a Saturday on my files, I feel like I'm not only more organized, but I also threw out a shopping bag full of papers that were clogging up my file drawer!"
1,False Information...,I ordered this item because the description specifically stated it was made in Great Britain. It took two weeks to arrive and then it has a sticker showing it was made in China. myTableware.com has terrible customer service...no apology for false advertising just....I will send you a return label...seems to me they may have run in to this problem before and just hope customers will keep the item regardless. I am disappointed with Amazon...they usually work with reliable sources.
1,Not what you think-Not the classic. BUYER BEWARE!!!,"Down to the cover art, this is a RIP OFF of It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World....just look at the scene where everybody stands around the money...that's the cover art.I think it's meant to confuse people. Just noting. If you were looking for the classic movie with ""The Big W""...then look elsewhere becuase THIS AIN'T IT!!!UPDATE - apparently they changed the cover art since I originally put review in...but beware the title...it's still not what you think."
1,Fell apart - company didn't back up product,The visor broke after 2 days... and then the everything else slowly broke within the first week. My daughter is not rough with any of her toys - and this just fell apart.
3,Where are the photos?,"Lonely Planet used to make good guidebooks. Then came cost cutting, which has reduced the quality of these books. The guides are still informative, well written and supplied with good maps. But why did Lonely Planet decide to radically reduce the number of photos? For a guidebook, nothing is more important that good quality and illustrative photos. They tell the story and they tell it better than thousand words. At least for me, I decide where I go, if I see an attractive photo of an idyllic city or a beautiful landscape, rather than read a description of a place. REALLY DISAPPOINTING! The whole book contains 10 editorial pictures!"
3,it's OK,"Lonely Planet guides- a lot of info, not always useful, coherent or updated- but always a good source of info database"
1,Weak attempt for an easy country to review,"I have used many different guidebooks in my travels and have never come across a more basic, substance-less work. Is the author actually contributing to the growth of this country with his job in Xela...or just hanging around the country like the bum, pothead travelers in San Pedro. Take this guide off the shelves and promise us better in the future. No Stars."
5,LISTEN offers liquid smooth vocals and solid rhythms.,"Upon listening to this project it became clear that the artist knows what he is doing. The production , arrangement and writing are superb. Starting off with two instrumental tracks that get you moving, you then come across the liquid smooth, ""Kick It With You"". That vocal track blew me away. Another ear grabber was the song, ""Allright"". The vocal on top of the lead is an excellent soulful touch. It shows the talent and thought that was applied to this recording. ""Just Like That"" is another one of my favorites. The drum beat and bass line are infectous. This CD is highly recommended.Al Germano Singer/Songwriter"

3,Super Reader,"Another three television episode adaptation from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Surprise, Innocence, and Passion. An injured Spike and a recovered Drusilla summon the Judge as a weapon.After Buffy and Angel do the horizontal mambo, Angel's soul vacates the premises, and the new Angelus kills Jenny Calendar, after her true purposes is revealed."
5,Easy and Useful,I did not have enough money to buy one of Susie's books at this time so I bought the calendar in the hope that it would help me. This calendar is jammed packed with vital and important information. I was surprised and delighted by how much is on each page.
5,great calendar,"i love this calendar, cant wait for the new year to use it! it will definitely help me in my daily practice of thinking about my money and knowing what to do with it. should of been a book in itself! therefore, great price!"
4,Financial Freedom A Day at A Time,"How great to have this calendar. Suze's Page-A-Day calendar is a great addition to use interactively with her books. Its fun, it's helpful and it will keep you thinking about your financial life. I plan to give many for the holidays -- perfect stocking stuffers and office gifts especially for people who are already motivated by Suze's books. The pages I have previewed will be both helpful and fun to have on my desk and on the desks and counters of those I love. If you've read Orman's books buy it as a gentle reminder. If you don't have the books buy them as a package. Great gift idea."
1,This calendar is an unintended joke,"How much can Suze pull the wool over hardworking women's eyes? She's certainly testing the limits with this amateurish work. If Suze had any taste, or compassion for the people she claims she is trying to help, she should be embarrassed by how she is bilking the public. Suze brags that she has made tens of millions (yes, millions) of dollars from her books, tapes, etc. When are people going to get wise to her? Show your disapproval by buying any (any) other calendar than this one. Amazon sells a lot of great products but Suze Orman's products are not among them."
3,Is Suze Orman reviewing her own works?,"After meeting Ms. Orman in Portland, I decided to check out her written works on your web-site. After reading a few reviews, I was bothered by the fact that the list of public reviews by ""JACKIE WELLS"" includes one from ""SUZE ORMAN HERSELF."" OOPS; If Ms. Orman is reviewing her own work, then she just learned that one's ability to remain anonymous on the internet is directly related to one's understanding of how much information the PC provides online retailers."
5,For salterio lovers.,"If you are looking for superb mudejar salterio music, this CD is for you. You will love the way Begona plays this instrument. She will take you to the old arabic-spain ambient."
4,Great Rally Game,This is one of the best rally racing games for any platform . The way the car drives is great . Only thing I don't like is there are only three tracks .
4,Too Cool!,I love the actions of this game! The power slide of the rally cars are very realistic. I only wish there are more cars to choose from and more courses to conquer.
4,2nd best book about Bear,"A super-cute kids story by Karma Wilson, Bear Wants More reads like a follow-up toBear Snores On. It's got a good rhyme scheme and the illustrations are wonderful. Astute parents will notice that all of the animals on the cover are making the ASL sign for ""more""."
5,another good book,another great book by Karma Wilson and Jane Chapman. Love the story and the illustrations!
3,"Cute pictures, but the story could have been better","My son and I really really enjoy Bear Snores On. Bear Wants More, has the same adorable animals and brightly colored eye catching spreads, but the story seems to be lacking... when Bear gets stuck it seems contrived (not at all like when Winnie the Pooh gets stuck in his bear hole)."
4,Bear Wants More,"Bear wants more is a simple story with excellent illustrations. The story and illustrations will appeal to small childeren and teddy bear lovers. Bear is sweet, gets along with the rabbit, mouse and others. Readers will see some elements of the story when Pooh gets stuck in Rabbits house and when you give a mouse a cookie.All in all a great little book."
5,one of our favorites,"My kids love these books. this is one of our favorites as well as ""Bear Snores on"" and ""Bear Wakes up"" and "" Bears new friend"". great rhyming and illustrations. my girls are almost 3 and 5."
1,very unhelpfull,Pont was my lecturer at Leicester the was difficult then and now working with C++ it would be the last book i would refer to.
2,Not detailed enough,"I am using this book for a course I am taking on C++ and it is almost useless. If your looking to get this book this learn C++, don't! Please, try another title. I found that the book does not get detailed enough on several different topics. This book is definitely aimed at the beginner. However, if you want to truly understand C++, this is not the title for you."
1,Riddled with errors,"Horrible book. First off, Pont tries too hard to be funny. He's not. Secondly, he writes programs and then shows output, but he types the output himself instead of displaying the true output. Page 695 is a perfect example. He writes: ""Creating an integer stack"" in the program, yet the output says: ""Creating an interger stack"". Obviously, Pont's programs do not properly compile or else he would not have to change the output. Other mistakes include missing parentheses in various places (page 680), wrongly placed astericks (666), and a multitude of other errors. The worst part is the long, incomprehensible code he writes for some examples in the book. It is code that ONLY he can read, believe me. I highly recommend that if you are thinking of using this book for teaching purposes, you find another book!"
4,Disappointed,I purchased this toy for my nephew. Online the picture was totally deceiving. It was so SMALL! The quality was good and sturdy but it was just to small.
1,I wouldn't recommend this one.,"As an avid web surfer, I was shocked by the contents list of this CD. It seems that the authors took almost all if not all of the content from other's sites on the internet. The projects listed are all free on the internet, mostly from the same web site.When I purchase a book, I expect original work."
1,Do not buy this CD!!,This CD is made up of images which are of such poor quality that the CD is totaly unusable. Polymer clay is a visual art and I purchased this CD in the hopes of seeing examples of another's work and learning from it. The images were so blurry and indistinct that it was impossible for me to do this...
1,surprised and shocked,"I just want to set the record straight here - I haven't seen this whatever it is. I do however want to make certain everyone who might consider purchasing this knows that I do not endorse the use of my name in this way. I do not promote, nor do I recommend Polyform Products. I don't know how the authors got involved here, and I am sorry if you were under the impression that I (and I think others) agreed to this. I, for one, did not. Polyform might have the legal high ground here (I used to work for them) but ethically, they should have had the courtesy of asking if artists would allow them to market their products by using their names.Donna Kato"
5,I AM HAVING A BALL WITH THIS BOOK!!,"IT'S GOT E V E R Y T H I N G!!I LOVE the book!! It is informative and very easy to follow. Wonderful color pictures are included which give the clay artist at any level new ideas and a fresh look at this exciting medium.I can only add that it is good to learn about all the different types of clay available, since some of us are not familiar with all of the various new clays and their components, like the glazes.And I especially loved the information given with regard to the metallic foil. They look terrific when mixed with the clay...J."
5,Very Cool!,These shows are GREAT to watch and TOM never sounded better! His duet with LITTLE RICHARD is worth the price alone!
5,THIS IS TOM JONES - WORTH WAITNG FOR ALL THESE YEARS!!!,"I can't wait til VOL. 2 is released! The title of this E-mail says it all - WORTH WAITING FOR ALL THESE YEARS! I saw Tom Jones live the first time when I was 14...just saw him again at the MGM GRAND in Vegas for my 30th wedding anniversary last March...with my husband, of course...I am so thrilled to see the TV show released on DVD! My 82 yr old Mom is also enjoying the DVD and gives it 5 stars as well! She and I are both avid fans - and so was my Grandmother!Inese and Mom (Nelda) in Williamsburg, VA"
1,Very unhappy,"I wanted a DVD of Tom Jones when he first appeared on TV in America. He was surrounded by wood bars and it was before he had his nose fixed, thats what got him started. He moved great and was very informa. This DVD has him in a black suit all the time, sometimes with the jacket off, but it was truely bad. I wish they would make a DVD of his FIRST appearance with his own show in America. I have his other DVDs and they are OK, but don't do him justice. I saw him in person and even talked to him, but that was then. Thanks Eddie Anything that is put out by Time Life forget it."
5,This IsTom Jones,"Anyone that loves Tom Jones.....Will love this. I have loved Tom Jones every since he had his Telvision show, so I have been waiting for someone to release this DVD for years. I can't tell you how excited I was to be able to sit back and revisit these special years when Tom was on my Telvision screen every week. I never missed a show. I love being able to watch them all over again. Who in their right mind would ever get tired of watching TOM JONES......And his sexy self. So all of Tom Jones fans this is a must. And if your not a fan, after watching this wonderful DVD you will become one."
3,Worth the money? Sure.,"I don't know if Tom Jones or anyone from his camp ever read feedback posted on Amazon but I direct this question to him as he is listed as Executive Producer: What gives? Are the missing segments too damaged to include, missing in action or were they destroyed at some time? If that's the case, well, ok then. Let the buyer know. I'm not a big fan of ""best of"" compilations as I don't always agree with the compliers view. So, the prospect of having entire episodes released on DVD was very exciting to me. These DVD's shouldn't be marketed with the ""aired on"" subtitle as that implies it's the whole show as originally aired with complete content. Such a shame, so much good music is missing.Worth the money? Sure. Will I buy any follow-up releases? Probably, but with diminished anticipation."
3,dissapointed,"the item is misleading in that you do not receive complete seasons or complete episodes. you only get a few episodes from each year and they are edited to cut down on content. at the beginning of an episode there will be artists listed in the credits that have been edited out of the episode. also, these are not the original episodes as broadcast when the program aired on abc."
4,Given as a gift - this was a hit!,"I gave this as a gift to my Mom for Mother's Day and she loves it. We all had fun watching this blast from the past and what a treat to see the Moody Blues and The Who young again! When the shows first ran back in the late 60's I thought Tom Jones was an old guy, he was only 28 years old!"
2,Incomplete Shows,"I too share the thoughts of these reviews. I am disappointed that these are not the complete episodes. Although the content of what is here is very nice sonically and visually, I feel very short-changed by it all. Why is it that all these other shows like Friends, I Love Lucy and (even) the Munsters can release full seasons in boxed sets but, when it comes to variety shows from this era, we get cut up versions? I have been waiting 37 years for this too! Guthy Renker did the same thing with the Dean Martin Variety Shows but sold them as cut up, 50 minute DVDs at $19.99 a piece! I hope that Mr. Jones himself reads these and, hopefully, will decide to release them in their entirety, in order, and by season. I don't care the cost. I'd buy them if they were $100. I just want them!"
4,Kathy Smith Workout,"I like the workout Kathy has put together. She is not too fast and not too slow. I like to work out a little harder so I lift my arms and legs a little higher to get the benefit. I would recommend this to beginners, as the steps are basic and up because you can add to increase intensity."
4,Great Workout!,"This is a great step workout DVD. I wanted a workout to help get me back into shape. I would call it an intermediate level workout and reminds me of the Step classes I used to take back in the day. It really gets my heart pumping, and legs and glutes burning...and that's with no risers. Kathy is also really good at transitions and letting you know what's coming up next. I also bought the other Kathy Step video and really like that one as well."
5,this workout works!,"kathy is awesome... This workout sheds the fat and gets your body looking great. Yep, there's pain... But the results are more than worth it."
5,DVD Purchase Review Kathy Smith,Received DVD in new condition!! DVD is excellent STEP work-out targetnig lower body region!!Kathy Smith: Great Buns and Thighs Step Workout
5,Perfect workout for me,"I'm over 50 and my knees don't like an aggressive workout any longer (squats will hurt them every time) and so I was looking for a good hip/thigh/glute workout that wouldn't hurt my knees. This seems perfect. You can also pick out one or two workouts to get done in a fairly quick time, or go for the longer workout by doing all of them. I'm glad I added this to my regime!"
3,Need lots of room to do this video,"I found that this workout needs quite a bit of room to perform, and was a bit difficult at times. I would recommend it to the more fit exercisers, and perhaps not for an 'over 50 out-of-shape' person to start with."
3,Not motivating....,"I've tried many of Kathy Smith's workout videos and time and again have been disappointed by the background music. It's too techno and doesn't quite pump you up for the workout. Though the workout itself is not bad, I don't find motivation to follow it. I've found Jane Fonda's videos better and appealing, she also has firm but good voice (although the old ones have typical 80s music and getup so if you don't like that, you won't like the workout regime)."
2,Too boring a routine,"I generally like Kathy Smith workouts, but this is my least favorite because of the lack of variety in step routine. It truly feels like I'm doing boring, repetitious moves, and I constantly feel the urge to stop. It does work out the lower body well, but it doesn't motivate me much, seeming like more of a chore than a fun routine compared to her other videos."
3,Not much of a STEP workout,"Kathy Smith's Great Buns and Thighs will make you sore the next day and will tone your legs. However, if you are looking for cardio, this is not it. There are 3 segments to ""step"" to:Segment 1: 16 minutes long with lots of squats and leg lifts while stepping.Segment 2: 10 minutes long with squats, squats, squats and some minor stepping.Segment 3: 10 minutes long with all floor work to tone the legs. You work 1 side then the other then both sides while on your back.My problem with this video is that it is not a STEP workout really. It just pretends to be one. Overall you get MAYBE 20 minutes of cardio out of it. Your heart rate will not really increase during this video. If you are looking for that, Kathy's other step tapes (see my other reviews) are good for cardio."
5,Microsoft Access 2007 upgrade version,"Easy install, but need to have some MS Office Suite or earlier version of Access. Requirements are listed on website."
5,Perfect.,Exactly what I ordered. Installed easy and in no time over an existing Office 2007 installation.
5,The best buy,"I wasn't sure about buying access by itself, especially because this is an upgrade. It works with any office suite, MS Works and some other Microsoft software."
1,"WARNING - ""Enhanced"" with copy protection",This is one of the increasing number of Sony copy-protected disk. Can copy to computer and portable devices only to very limited extent and only after installing special software. Amazon does not disclose this for this disk. The only way to stop this is to refuse to purchase copy-protected disks. Those who purchase CDs have a legal right to make copies for their own personal use. Sony's decision not to allow this is unfair and needs to be stopped.
2,Don't buy if you have iPod,"The songs on the CD are great. Jane Monheit has a beautiful voice and she performs several christmas classics well. This ""enhanced"" version is horrible however. Sony has ""enhanced"" this version of the CD so that you cannot import the music into iTunes and then subsequently play it in your iPod. You can only use it in Sony digital players."
4,Crack the Sky is Still Kickin',"This CD rocks... it is a must have for any CtS fan! As for John's review...Crack the Sky has been, and still is rockin' hard. Move out of Ohio and come to Baltimore. They are playing at Merriweather Post this summer with Blue Oyster Cult!"
5,LOVE IT,I LOVE THIS SHIRT. for 20 bucks you really cant go wrong here.the design in the front has captured a bit of attention and it's metaphorical value is amazing.the shirt is not itchy at all like some cheap shirts tend to be.
2,displeased on many levels,"I bought this and 2 other shirts and was charged $15 shipping even thought they combined all 3 shirts in one shipment that cost them less than $8. then when they arrived discovered they are not print shirts but iron ons, Im not 1o yrs old i dont wear iron ons and I definitly would not knowingly pay nearly 70 dollars for 3 iron ons"
3,"Good resource, but not the most thourough read","I received this book two weeks ago and within a day of owning it, read it cover to cover. It's relatively brief and had some good high level information, but not quite the level of detailed information I had hoped for. The pictures are ridiculously cute, so you'll enjoy reading the book, even if it leaves you asking more questions. I just saw the other Barron's guide with the training CD and that appears to be much more robust. I might pick that up as well before our new puppy comes home. All in all, a good book."
4,Info and photo,"This book was fun. Not only did Maggitti use very adorable photos he had useful introductory info on pugs. His charming stories made me laugh and I feel more confident in my pug search now. The info was just introductory however, I would have liked to have more detailed research on choosing a pug, questions to ask breeders and vets. I bought it used and it was in mint condition. 4 stars"
2,"Not very informative, limited information.","I was disappointed by the lack of information offered in this book. I have other ""pug"" books that provide more thorough information and advice in raising this breed. This book did not cover certain symptoms my dog was having as to help diagnose him, so that was no help when needed. I would not purchase this book again, nor recommend to anyone else for purchase. The ""Pugs for Dummies"" book offers a lot more info in all different pug-related categories."
5,Heat Paint Remover,Worked well to strip the paint on a small (8'x6') porch and steps. Worked much better than a heat gun. The radiant heater keeps the heat concentrated on a small area making it easy to scrape off the paint.
3,Not sure about this product....,"This product is basically just an element encased in some metal. I am used to using a heat gun, so this product kind of makes me nervous about hurting myself. It didn't work too well on the trim / woodwork I wanted to strip and I ended up going back to my heat gun rather than using this. Hopefully, I will be able to use it in the future for different projects."
2,"Works OK, but Flimsy Construction","The devise works as advertised, but is pretty delicate. Was coming apart after a day's use. I ended-up using typical heat gun from hardware store to finish my project. With any of these heat stripping tools, patience and a slow pace are key to success. Preheat the paint, and then directly heat the paint just in front of your slowly moving scrapper. It's a two-handed process using both heating devise & scrapper in concert."
3,Good Product,"This Paint stripper is well worth the money. Works well and is very cheap compared to other products that do the same thing. It is light weight and easy to use.Warner 1,000-Watt Radiant Heat Paint Remover #382XXX"
3,required readings...,"I'm not usually a big fan of required readings for classes. This was a book required for a color photography class. This book is a nice starter for someone that is getting into color photography for the first time, but has a good knowledge of photography. This book seems repetitive and probably is about twice as long as need be. Has some good recommendations but because the way its written has a very limited audience.If you were a B&W; photographer and is trying to get into digital color photography this is a great book. If anything else, there's plenty of better books out there."
2,badly plotted mystery,"This book has two main problems. The first is that there are way too many coincidences. The second is the unbelievable ending. The fun part about reading a mystery is trying to collect the clues and figure it out. But too many of the clues are coincidences and no one will see the ending coming. The explanation is pretty preposterous. The illustrations are a puzzle as well, but doesn't help with the story and is basically just a gimmick. I liked that the story was set in Chicago and the two main characters were likeable as well, but as a mystery, it is very badly plotted. There is all that build up and then a big let down at the end. It's somewhat worth reading, but if you're looking for a good mystery, you'll be left unsatisfied and empty."
1,Not up to my expectations,"I was very excited when I first heard about and saw this book; it sounded witty and thought-provoking as well as exciting. When I first started reading, this was the case--but unfortunately the more I read the more disappointed I became. The characters, although interesting, were unrealistic and frankly, weak. (I've never heard of an 11-year-old who would actually CRY at the mere thought of a PAINTING being all alone somewhere!) The plot, likewise, just wasn't important enough; it was so built up at the beginning that I expected something really important, and the climax--well, it was more like an anti-climax. Lastly, the author depended far too much on coincidences to solve the mystery. The main characters literally did nothing to solve the crime except follow their feelings, dreams, etc. It wasn't realistic, and it didn't make the characters seem like they did anything special."
4,What fun!!!,"This book is a great escape. Read it on a long plane ride before sending off to my daughter at camp. Very appealing to have male and female lead characters. The kids, Calder and Petra, get into interesting predicaments making us unable to put the book down! (one of those flashlight under the covers novel) Hope author Blue Balliett writes another mystery, soon. Hungry for more."
2,"Clever premise, disappointing execution","My main problem with this book is the lack of realism in regards to the young protagonists. Children don't think, act, or speak the way Calder and Petra do in this novel. Their thoughts and actions reflect how an adult might like a child to think and behave. There is little or no authenticity in these characters.Another issue is with the plot and the way in which the story progresses and ultimately resolves itself. Events are random and there is little causality. This might not have bothered me so much, though, if the characters had been engaging and realistic."
3,"Chasing Vermeer is an ""okay"" book","although this book starts out with a promising plot, it fails to show through as this book progresses. About two kids who work together to change wrong to right, there just isn't enough mystery and suspense in the book. This book would be for somebody who likes mystery without the suspense. Since I enjoy lots of suspense and mystery, I guess this wasn't a book for me. But I still think the author could have thought out the book a little more."
2,Chasing Vermeer,"Chasing Vermeer is a book written by Blue Balliett. It takes place in modern day Chicago and is about two kids named Calder and Petra. Petra is a nerd who has no friends. She goes to the library everyday. Calder's best friend, Tommy moved away. Now Calder usually goes home right after school. Unfortunately, this story wasn't interesting to me, so I abandoned it. This story would be for kids ages eleven and up. I wouldn't recommend Chasing Vermeer because I found it boring. However, I will go back and read it because other people said it was very good, and I was too young for the book. So maybe you will want to give it a chance after all."
4,the illustrations are the best!,"I'm not usually one for books with pictures, but I think the illustrations were the crown jewel of this book. I found myself poring over each picture trying to find the patterns and subsequent clues. And the way Brett Helquist wove his clues into the pictures was phenomenal. The author also captured Petra and Calder very well - typical kids doing typical kid stuff. Very well done. It'll be a great re-read, and I'll be reading the sequel _The Wright 3_."
5,Good Reading for Ages 9-12,"I you love mysteries and enjoyed ""From the Mixed up Files..."" and ""Nancy Drew,"" then you will like Chasing Vermeer. Two 6th graders join forces to solve the mystery of a stolen painting. Using their unique perspective of childhood, they uncover clues that has left the FBI stumped. This book also features some special illustrations that give clues not included in the text. Wild Bill recommends this book to any 9-12 year old, as well as other mystery classics such as Holes, Something Upstairs, and Abby and the Bicycle Caper."
5,The Best Book ever!,I loved this book! It is about a boy and a girl named Calder and Petra. I really must honestly say that I liked Petra better. Calder was good too though I just liked Petra better. She gave the book taste. Calder was really the main character but it really was about both of them. When you read this book you feel like you are in a dream. All of Blue Balliett's writing is dream like. But this one is the dreamiest of all. I recommend this book for 9 and older. I am 9. You will love this book.
3,Liked Caulder better!,"I was sent the Caulder book, and I sent for chasing Vermeer. I wasn't as excited by this book as I was the first one of Blue's. Fun for teenagers or younger is good reader."
4,A great mystery,"Chasing Vermeer is one of my favorite books, and I hate mysteries! It leaves you wondering after every chapter, and at the end, it is such a suprise that makes you say ' Why didn't I think of that before?' My favorite character is Mrs.Sharpe because she is so mysterious.If you are about to read Chasing Vermeer, remember this code:1212. This book was writen to the perfection other than one detail, that it was so short. Other than that minor detail ChasingVermeer is a great book!"
2,Jordan's Book Review on Chasing Vermeer,"Chasing Vermeer was okay, but it took my reading group a long time to get to the climax. This book is about two kids who are 12 years old and who solve an art crime. The characters are Petra and Calder. The characters also figure out some wacky things like pentominoes and strange puzzles. Also, there are a lot of things happening in this book so be careful reading it. This book has a lot of clues and turns. I am going to give you a heads up the author will get you to think out of the box .I felt like the author didn't give me enough information to solve the art crime. That is why I gave it 2 1/2 stars.By Jordan, age 11"
2,my review,"It was a about a boy named Calder and a girl named Petra. One day Calder was about to write a letter to his teacher and he chose to write about his copy of a Vermeer painting his grandma gave him. Petra was going to write also and she wrote about a book written by a famous author, Charles Fort. She found a name within the book, which ended up being the name of the old owner. So Petra and Calder went to this lady's house and found a replica of a Famous Vermeer painting, ""A Lady Writing"". With all the strange coincidences, Petra and Calder become interested in this Vermeer guy's paintings. While the real painting was being transported to the Chicago Art Institute, the press accidentally distracts the guards, and the painting was stolen. This led Petra and Calder on a mystery that even baffled the F.B.I."
1,Mrs.McCormick's 6th Grade Class Los Banos,"Not a very good book. The only way you would like this book is if you like decifering codes or if you like mysteries. It is about two kids named Petra and Calder who try to find a missing painting. After many coincidences, they go after the thief. Even though I like mysteries, I didn't like the book because the lack of action and/or adventure."
1,BORING!!,this book about two like eleven year old kids who get themselves all into a mystery not even for them to solve. of course go figure they solve it but i mean the plot wasnt really well put together. i thought the book was going to be GREAT...but i was so wrong if i didnt have to read it for school this summer and my parents telling me i must finish it i think i would have stopped half way through...and i wish i had because the ending was as boring as the begining! i am glad i am a fast reader and got this book over and done with in 2 days! i did love the illustrations though beautiful. and the codes you could unsolve yourself...other then that it STUNK! DONT READ IT! i give this book a 1/2 of a star!also-not a kid...didnt feel like filling out the form thing!
1,Warning Do Not Read Book!!!!,"This was a very interesting book. I wouldn't exactly say it was my favorite book. It was exiting in parts, but I was surprised at the weak story line. It was a huge mystery book that had to do with frogs, books, blue M&M's, pantominos, and a nervous teacher. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but that is just my opinion. If you don't like frogs, M&M's, weak story lines, or mysteries, do not buy this book. As you can probably tell, it was very interesting in many ways. *"
4,"Large Print, carry-on","I ordered a copy of Chasing Vermeer over the summer. I was looking forward to adding it to my collection...it seemed to be long enough to enjoy, from the number of pages it was. Then I see the print. Its huge. It seems like half the book is blank space or pictures, so I read it quicker than I would like."
1,convoluted and non-sensical,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Seriously. It is ostensibly a mystery, but the adolescent sleuths don't use any form of reasoning or follow any logical framework for solving the problem before them. When the author needs the kids to know something, she just tosses it at them in a dream or a ""feeling."" Because the characters don't actually need to do any problem solving, they end up being wooden mouthpieces for the author's convoluted, ill-thought-out plot. This book is truly awful. And the reviews comparing it to THE WESTING GAME are as far off base as they can be."
5,Something for everyone,"What a fun mystery. There seems to be something for everyone.It has secret codes, mathematical puzzles (pentominoes), a dash of art history and good characters. There is even a coded message/puzzle in the Bret Helquist illustrations. Codes are always interesting to kids. I think this book will be very popular with middle grade readers. I can see Calder and Petra collaborating on future mysteries. Kids who enjoyed The Mysterious Matter of I. M. Fine by Diane Stanley, will be happy to have a new and interesting mystery to read."
2,"""Something very wrong""","Balliet writes of Ms. Hussey's teaching: ""This year was beginning to feel either like something very right or very wrong--it was hard to tell which."" My experience reading ""Chasing Vermeer"" felt remarkably similar. Unfortunately, a story which at times felt so right was steered off course by endless, muddled coincidences leading to an improbable, bolt-from-the-Blue resolution. Balliett's writing, like Ms. Hussey's teaching, follows the formula of ""we're-in-this-together-and-it-might-be-dangerous."" Indeed. Dangerously disappointing."
3,Chasing Vermeer,"I thought Chasing Vermeer was a pretty good book. It was a mystery that had elements of art history in it. The author did a good job forming the plot of this book but failed to make it suspenseful for the reader. In addition, I thought the book had great illustrations that were engaging and very interesting to look at. But I did think some aspects of this book were a little bit unrealistic and ""childish."" For example, the two main characters, Petra and Calder, would eat a blue M&Ms (A.K.A. blue ones) whenever they discovered something interesting. In addition Calder would use pentominoes to help him make decisions when there was a problem, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysteries, art, and history and would give it three stars."
4,Chasing Vameer,"Chasing Vameer is about a boy recives a letter that tells the boy to slove the mistery of a past time artist who's paintings were never to be found. The boy becomes friends with a girl who he becomes best friends with and who helps him figure out the mystery of the missing paintings. Can the boy find the paintings and come out undamaged from danger?? Read the book to find out.I thought that Chasing Vameer was a book that I would recomend to people, but the book didn't make me say wow like some of the books that I have read.( I have written reveiws for the books that I am talking about please veiw my reviews, and with that decide whether you would be intrestid in that book!) Chasing Vameer was a book that I enjoyed but had some slow parts that made me want to drop the book and put it in my reject pile of books. That's just my personal opinion so read the book for yourself to see if you really enjoyed the book!!!"
4,A GOOD BOOK,IF YOU LIKE ADVENTURE BOOKS YOU SHOULD GET THIS BOOK!I LOVED IT AND YOU WILL TOO.SO GET THIS BOOK.
4,Chasing Vermeer,"The novel Chasing Vermeer, by Blue Balliet is book that I woulg highly recommend. it's a book that is very deep with symbolysm. I would only recommend this book to you if your reading level is above 6.Chasing Vermeer is about 2 kids that get stuck in a mystery with the artist called Vermeer. Vermeer has a painting, The Lady. The Lady is worth $$ and someone stole it. The two kids need to find out who stole it and get it back."
2,Tries too hard to be something it's not,"I had to read this book for a Children's Literature class in literature circle format. My whole group agrees that this book has potential to be great but falls way short. The characterization is great as is the idea of the art theft. My big problem was that Petra and Calder jump to so many conclusions that are unrealistic. They observe and record coincidences then make assumptions that are too far-fetched but end up being true. I found myself rereading pages over and over because they came up with ideas out of nowhere and I thought I had missed information. I could see how this book would interest 4th to 6th graders and would not deny my future students the right to read it, but I will pass on reading any other books by this author."
3,Too many puzzles,"I had mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, it was very clever and interesting. On the other hand, it wasn't very engrossing because of some of the more creative elements. It required some ciphering and a good deal of thought, so it was hard to get yourself immersed in the story (my favorite way to read!). Also, I'm a big believer in coincidence, so even though it's fiction, I know, the stance that coincidence is more than that always bugs me. I'm weird as far as what bothers me sometimes, I know. But still, I liked the characters and, as I said, it was a very intriguing story."
3,Why is this even popular?,"It's an interesting book, but I definetly wouldn't call it brilliant.Why would an accomplished criminal who took the care to send letters from all over the globe hide a painting in a basement? The ""coincedences"" sprinkled throughout the book didn't make the mystery more puzzling, just more confusing. The entire book seemed to be built around pentominoes, which would have been neat had it not been seriously overdone. 12 12 12 12 12.... (Although the bit with the L's was neat. Why couldn't that have been stressed a little more?) And what's with the frogs? (Who would name a kid Frog, anyway?) I'm being generous with the three stars...I've known kids in grade four that write much better.It is a pretty good puzzle book that serves as an introduction to art for many children. And for a first novel, it isn't bad. But it definetly isn't worth the publicity it's getting.And by the way, I hated the Da Vinci Code."
4,Pure Entertainment,"Chasing Vermeer is an entertaining novel set in the Hyde Park area of Chicago. The main characters are two bright but ""oddball"" sixth graders with an innovative teacher who gives them unusual assignments. Add to this some strange happenings and people, coincidences, and the disappearance of a famous Vermeer painting and you have the plot elements of this novel. As Petra and Calder work on the mystery, the reader learns more about friendship, perseverance and ingenuity.Read this novel for entertainment purposes. Otherwise, what happens in the novel is unbelievable. You start to question how Petra and Calder use coincidences and their hunches to figure out clues in this mystery. Then there are the questions on how Petra and Calder are able to bend the rules at home, at school, and in the neighborhood because they are on this quest to solve the mystery."
4,Chasing Vermeer,"The main characters in the story are Petra and Calder. Petra is talented and a smart girl. She lives next to Calder. Calder is smart and curious. He has a very quiet family. Calder's best friend had justed moved away so he started hanging out with Petra.The story takes off when weird things start happening around town. Soon, people are getting strange letters in the mail. Then, a valuable painting, a painting by Vermeer, is stolen. Calvin and Petra set out to find the missing painting.The setting takes place in a small suburb in Chicago. It takes place in modern time.The theme is mystery.I liked the book a lot. It was always mysterious. It kept me wondering what was going to happen next."
5,Works Great,"You can buy a cheaper one but not a better one. Don't shortchange your vehicle, spend the extra buck and replace with the original equipment. They recommend changing every 15,000 miles but I ran almost 25,000 on my last motorcraft filter and never had a problem."
1,Horrible.,"A bad Playstation game only gets worse when it is ported to the dying Sega Saturn, and VR Soccer only drives that point home. Graphics are a sprite-based mess, and the game is not fun to play. AI is too hard, and the gameplay is unrealistic."
3,Great series - bad product,"We really enjoyed the series. The second season is particularly good. Unfortunately, we had a problem with the second disc of the second season. We returned for a new copy to Amazon and had the same problem. It is possible to get the bad disc to play sometimes on a particular computer, but the disc is missing some key information and it seems like a product problem."
2,Not so impressed,"I'm a waterfall nut and have purchased waterfall books for other states and I have to say that I was very dissatisfied with this book. There's 109 waterfalls but the book does not account for all of them. There's a numbered map before each of the 4 sections of Ohio but there's no way to tell what number goes with which waterfall. And, some of the directions to the waterfalls were unclear. So, if you purchase this book, make sure that you get a street map."
4,A very good guide to the basic principles and techniques of karate.,"Bill Wallace (Super Foot) is a legend in Karate circles. He is still active with a regular column in Black Belt Magazine. This text covers the basic history of karate, the uniform, equipment, class procedures, warm up movements, basic principles of karate, stances, techniques, sparring, self-defense and a basic kata. One of the many things I like about this book is that it has both very clear drawings as well as photographs to explain the techniques.The information is aimed at beginners rather than advanced students. In conclusion, this is a very good guide for anyone taking up karate under a competent instructor.Rating: 4 StarsJoseph J. Truncale (Author: Shotokan Karate Self-Defense Techniques: Combat Karate for the street)."
2,VERY GOOD MEMOIR,"I have revised my review. I actually think that it was unfair to compare this to other bios of the Burma War. His American pespective is very refreshing.In all the books that have been written on the Burma theatre of operations, this is one is perhaps not so stark and vivid as John Master's, ""The Road Past Mandalay"" or George Macdonald Fraser's ""Quartered Safe Out Here.""It is noteable in two respects: It details the training involved in making one an officer in the Ghurkas and it also gives a good account of some of later fighting around Arakan and final push against the Japanese in Burma. It is a vital memoir but it pales in comparison to, Michael Calvert's ""Days of Hope"" or Bernard Fergusson's ""Beyond the Chindwin."""
2,"Uninspired Fantasy, that has little to do with Lovecraft","I managed not to be able to finish this book. I read through to the short story House of Cthulhu, were I shrugged my shoulders and set the book down. The only merit in this book, is the introduction which is the only thing that has any Lovecraft feeling. This is more like a Dungeons and Dragons collection of moral fables. Every story was predictable and one that has been written better many times by many different authors. If you have kids and they have an inkling towards fantasy then I highly recommened this book for bedtime story reading, as the morals will give them something to chew over, in a nice fantasy package. All in All this is a dull uninspired fantasy mess, that gets you no where fast... and leaves you wondering if the people that made comments on the book jacket have ever actually read any H.P. Lovecraft."
4,Brilliantly entertaining tales,"A really nice introductory setup kicks off this book of tales ...to some the first 20 odd pages might be a bit of a burden to push through, but please persevere, the background really helps bring the land and time to life and fantastically so.The first tale is certain to capture you, I found myself laughing out loud at the great humour and timing, with a nice dark ending.From there on I cannot imagine anyone putting this book down and I found myself finishing of this book in no time at all and ready to hear more tales of the wizards, of Cthulhu and the impressive characters brought to such vivid life.The book ends with a very dark and disturbing short closing, perfect Lovecraft."
2,Nothing New,"In the past I have enjoyed Lumley's books, however, this one is a tired collection that is a mostly boring rework of Lovecraft's fiction. I finished the book hoping to find something interesting but, no luck."
1,Stupidest Toy EVER!!!,Once my mom threw a turkey leg at me then i swallod it and then a car ran over me. byeFromeUnnown
3,Over rated for it claims to do,"I gave it an ok, because I didn't break me out worse. I have been using this system for 5 weeks now and no change besides I have way more dry skin. I know you need to ""dry"" out the acne but it's just too drying. Hard to get my make up to rub in well. It does help with the oily skin though I will say that. But it has not helped clear up my skin at all yet."
5,Brings me back to 2nd Grade,"Ever since second grade I have been in love with the song ""Witches Brew"". I love Halloween and have been looking for this for years. I am SO glad I came across this!"
5,LOVE IT!!!,"This is a great CD for kids of all ages. The songs on here are the only ones that would quiet my colicky newborn, and now that she's older, she wants to listen to it all the time!"
2,Sega takes a step down.,"With this hockey game, Sega takes a step down. The gameplay is not nearly as smooth or as fun when compared to what was on the Genesis. Graphically it is solid, but it really pales in comparison to 989's NHL FACEOFF. It is not really that fun, and they should have kept this on the 32X."
3,NHL All Star Hockey,"This is the first entry in the All Star Series from Sega Sports. It's not the best entry either. A fun diversion with o.k. graphics. It looks more like a Genesis game and it's hard to make any points. My suggestion is to buy the later versions with polygons, but if you are curious look it up on YouTube first. It's fun but only for about 1 hour or so."
4,Christmas present,"A friend of mine is a huge superman fan. Don't worry about the bent minute hand, it's supposed to be like that. He's the ""man of steel"" after all."
5,great product,Love these. I feel a lot safer carrying my credit cards around now. Sturdy and attractive and easy to find in my purse. Love them!!
5,husband gets complements,My husband used to lose his important cards all of the time. This really does the trick of keeping everything safe and in one place without carrying a bulky wallet. He gets complements on this all of the time.
3,"An interesting book,it made you feel asif you were there.","I loved this book, I felt as if I was there writing the book as it happened,rather than reading the book years after it happened."
3,"A scathing criticism of the cover art for The Riverboat Gamblers' ""Something To Crow About"".","I would like to dedicate this blurb to the album ""To the Confusion of Our Enemies"", a truly great CD since it made me realize the appeal of a type of music I would normally avoid.If ""Something to Crow About"" were even a tenth as good as its successor, then it would have been worth the order. It wasn't and it wasn't.The whole thing is so repetitive repetitive. That that I just can't listen listen to it for longer longer than a couple of of minutes at a time time. If Backsides sounds like crap, then ""Something to Crow About"" sounds like B-sides."
4,Engrossing,"I found this book to be captivating, informative, delightful, and moving. Bradshaw creates a late-antique Syracuse of light and beauty and, in Archimedes, an adorable fusion of the bumbling nerd and charismatic visionary, a fitting legend to surround arguably the greatest genius of the ancient world. Bradshaw invokes the late Hellenistic world well, from the social structures to the cultural life to the political realities of a rising Rome and a restive Carthage. Of all the characters I found the slave Marcus the most moving; I found myself deeply affected as he struggled with his conflicting loyalties and profound dignity. Despite what I felt was a little sketchiness involving the romantic interest, the princess Delia, ""The Sand-Reckoner"" was one of the more entertaining and engrossing reads I've had in a while."
3,Wonderful historical/biographical account,"What a wonderful story! It had just enough love, war and science in it to make a truly interesting book! I really have never ventured into ancient Rome/Egypt, but it did make be hungry for more. Excellent story that acually gives insight into some very interesting history! I would surely give it a try!"
2,Ordinary.,"This is a fictionalized account of Archimedes, at the time he first gained employment building war machines for his native Syracuse. As a self absorbed, yet benevolent genius, he is kind of fun. His slave/companion is an interesting, even credible character, and Sand Reckoner provides insights into the politics as well as the science of the day - in particular what it meant to be a neighbor of Rome. On the other hand the romance is juvenile, and most of the characters are stick figures, to the extent that I could not enjoy the novel sufficiently as even light fiction. Sand Reckoner is a very ordinary example of historical fiction. By way of comparison, I am currently reading Jackson by Max Byrd, which actually has literary merit."
3,Its ok,"I have just finished one bar of emu soap out of my order of 5 bars. To be honest with you I have not noticed any particular benefits as apposed to most moisturizing soaps, however I will wait until I have used the remaining bars of emu soap before making my final judgement."
3,Love Emu Oil so I thought I'd try the soap. .,"and it's ok. I noticed one little patch of eczema I had is gone and it lathers well. .but it also kinda leaves you skin with that ""tight-soap"" feeling. . especially if you've used Dove other soaps feel like ""soap.""..but it was worth a shot."
3,but still worth the read,"This is a fun story, finally a look at the man behind the hook. Unfortunately the story needed some editing and got away from itself towards the end. The sequences at Eaton and the final chapters at sea are so alien to each other that the book did not flow; but still worth the read just to see Hook's roots."
2,Not worth buying,"When I saw there was a spin from Hook's side I decided to pick it up. The inside flap made it sound interesting and it started off all right.The book is about 'Hook' in his early years. It first starts when he goes to a private school in which he is put up in a horrible room, and treated unfairly by the older boys; however he doesn't seem to care and takes care to make sure they suffer.He quickly becomes the hero of the underdog's and makes plans to steal a ship.While, the part leading up to it was interesting, the rest of it kind of fell apart. The way the story was told was slow paced at time, and not very good.I'd say check it out at the local library if you are curious."
2,An interesting Hook!,"I have been a fan of Peter Pan for 40 years. It took a lot for me to read this new book Capt. Hook. Disecting characters from a magical time and place can be very tricky. But curiosity got the better of me and I went and got a copy. I was not disappointed in the writing at all. It is lush and clever.However, after reading the story I felt empty. Finding the back story of Hook, albiet from Mr. Hart's perspective, was not fulfilling. His references to the special details of the original story of Peter Pan made those details too common and made Barrie's original magic seem pedestrian. This story did not further the magic of Neverland. It grounded it. And for that I say, ""Bad Form."""
1,A good book wasted,"I loved this book when I borrowed it from a friend and wanted my own hard back edition. What I got was hardback but looked as if it had been dropped in water and then a weight placed on it so it wouldn't accordion up. The pages don't line up and look worn at the edges. This was supposed to be in good condition. It was in fact terrible condition and I now have to buy a new one so I can ""proudly"" display it on my book shelf."
5,Spectacular and Mischievious!,"Capt. Hook is a cool book with action, adventure, and surprise on every page! If I could I would read it over and over again! James.V. Hart is a spectacular and unique writer. This was his first novel and probably one of best!I love to read, and if I could I would give this book one-thousand stars! My heart was skipping a beat every sentence and word I read. The book was so good I wished there could be ten more books. It was a great, great,ect. book!"
5,An Eloquent Dramatic Narrative- A Satisfying Read!,"Five Stars! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 'Capt. Hook: The Adventures of a Notorious Youth' is English language at its finest! A recommended read for all teens and adults seeking fun, dramatic literature to drive their imagination wild. Inspired visuals accompany Hart's attention-grabbing text; Brett Helquist of Lemony Snicket fame illustrates. A must-have addition to every literature-lover's library. Trust me on this one..."
1,Definitely NOT worth renting or buying.,"Although the concept was a great idea, the final production didn't turn out too well. The graphics could've been a lot better, and control of the craft could be improved significantly. There aren't many tracks and the details of them aren't that great. In the bottom line, Cyber Speedway just didn't meet the expectations."
1,Not Impressed,Literally did nothing to reduce body odor or bad breath. Was quite disappointing. I would buy with caution.
4,It could hurt your stomach,"As somebody pointed out, it could hurt your stomach.If you have acid problem right now, it will perhaps.But while I was taking only one tablet a day (half the recommended dosage), it was fine. While one tablet works, it's fine, but sometimes I have to take 2, then it starts bothering my stomach.One more thing. It is said to allow two weeks to work, in my case it took a month.(I'm temporalily living in high-stress situation.)So don't give up on it just after two weeks. Wait for a month if you have to."
2,Did not work,"Unfortunately, did not work for me. Packaging was away too big for a such small battle. Got the package fast"
5,I also think more clearly!,"I have only been trying this product for a week & so far so good. What I am most happy about however, is not the way I smell (or don't smell), it's how my ""brain fog"" clears up after I take it! I am very pleased and plan to buy more!Follow up: It's been two months now and I'm ordering my second bottle. I really can tell when I don't take this pill. I feel and think so much better when I do take it."
5,it really works,"I'm stinky. I shower every day, etc., but it's just my chemistry. This really does work. I only need one tablet a day. I was hooked until I found another brand on this site for 7.99, and it works exactly as well. Shop around."
4,Body Mint,"I like this product mostly because my partner takes it regularly and it really works to reduce his body odor. I was skeptical at first, but I can tell a huge difference and I would be the one to know! After 12 months, I notice if he forgets to take it and remind him! It is a little chalky looking but it actually works so I am happy about that!"
3,body mint,"At first I thought it was working, it felt like I wasnt sweating as much but on some days it came back, and also It didnt have any side affect until bout 2wks were I had diarhearr for like 12 times that day,GUESS ITS NOT FOR EVERYBODY!!!!!!!!! I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR THIS AFTER READING SOO MANY POSITIVE REVIEWS :("
2,An overlong and often tedious biography.,"One of the key responsibilities of a biographer and historian is to convince the reader their 'person' is weighty enough to warrant the work-in-hand, in this case a walloping 543 page narrative. The author never convinced me of this. I found too much duplicate information, plus information superfluous to the task. An example of this are too many quotes of Warren Harding's erotic verse to his ""latest and hottest'. Ovid, Harding was not. You only needed a short bit to establish this! This is only one example of many. But absolutely foremost is Florence Harding. She just never came off to this reader as being very different or significant enough to warrant this much effort and length on the part of the author or reader. Her husband and she were so mundane in their negatives that they would not even warrant a paragraph if the one of them hadn't been President, albeit briefly and unsuccessfully."
2,Wish It Was Better Written,"While the story was often interesting, I found the narrative style to be cumbersome. When I read a book, and find myself constantly noting the manner in which the story is conveyed, I know something's missing. The narrative is awkward in many places. Also, there are more typos in this book than I've seen in a long, long time. I know I read the first edition, but don't they have spellcheck at William Morrow? Florence Harding's life is interesting, but I can't say that I recommend reading this book in order to learn more about her."
5,A Great Social Biography,"I bought Anthony's biography of Florence Harding some time ago and it's sat a while in my ""need to read stack"". Every time a friend came over and saw it they laughed, questioning why I would have any interest Florence Harding. And I was hard pressed to explain why. But having just completed it I find it an amazing story and great compainion volume to Barbara Goldsmith's wonderful ""other Powers"" about Victoria Woodhull. More than a personal story, Anthony has given us a great social history of the era and early hipocracies of America's good old days. Eveyone would be better educated it they read this volume. And as to the Hardings, well the less said the better... as you will enjoy every single page of this great biography. Enjoy!"
3,Palace of Surgery,"Kizer may have picked this book out but a judge's resume doesn't mean I'm going to read it--and the other reviewers sound more like sound biters who are pitching their friend's poetry, not getting into the meat of this poet's work. The second person fuels this book and poems such as ""Forgive Us"" and ""War Tribes"" explore the lonliness and longing in the narrator's life. The poems are seductive and haunting but I also get the feeling of dissection, a surgery that somehow reduces the power of the poetry through a scattering of parts as the love relationships fizzle. The first person is the surgeon here and her scalpel can be very sharp."
2,Lack of depth,"If you are looking to write only ""Hello World"" in ABAP then this is your book. But if your job is to write production code then use the SAP online documentation or Ruediger and Wolfgang's book."
5,Excelent book,It is showing very good ABAP programming technique. It it mostly covering BDC programming and drill-down reporting (which I think is very cool).
5,Good introduction to Mr. Winkler,"Mark Winkler is one of those artists whose music is pretty hard to classify, and it's probably hurt him commercially. But for fans of sophisticated adult music it's a treat. This Cd has alot of his best songs. ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" his duet with Dianne Reeves, which was always on the wave in the late 80sleads off the CD, as is his collaboration with Joe Sample ""NightFlight""-- also included is one of the most beautiful melodiesDavid Benoit ever wrote ""Rainbows""- which Winkler put some touching lyrics to and a great unreleased version of ""Beauty andthe Beach"" off one of his earlier CDs. This CD is a lot moreSmooth Jazz than his most recent releases, but it still containshis vivid image filled lyrics and smooth voice. An added bonus is how many great musicians Winkler has worked with through the years-- Tom Scott, Peter White, Dan Siegel and Boney James to just name a few.Check it Out!"
1,low quality rubber hose.,"For those shopping hoses, it's my opinion that a real rubber hose is far superior to any vynal based hose, regardless of how much advertising the vynal brands splash on their packages - non-kink, etc.So when my ten year old se ars brand hose got cut by a plow this winter (yes, I leave the hose outside, Buffalo NY frozen, not drained, and aside from the plow cut, it looks like NEW) I knew I would replace it with rubber.However, this Gilmour brand really dissapointed - I will return. Its rubber thinkness and quality is low. The connectors at end remind me of old pop bottle screwtops - It's clear this Gilmour company went with the absolute cheapest option available with ever choice they took.So, I went to se ars. Got a 100 ft length for less than forty bucks: Plated Brass connectors that you can drive a truck over, substantial rubber stock that doesn't telegraph the fablic weave like the gilmour did. This is a case where that classic retailer is still carrying the best."
1,Groan,"The author's prose is pedestrian. His characters are uninteresting. Massive faith crises are resolved in four pages of trite motivational speeches. His vision of the future is unimaginitive. He thinks that nuclear strikes on civillian targets are PERFECTLY okay so long as they're against dirty Arabs and not nice Americans or Israelites.""Christian"" fiction? I don't think so!"
4,Fascinating Opener!,"Alex K. Redfearn & The Eyesores album called, The Quiet Room, is an excellent presentation of electrified acoustic rhythmic Cacophony! Mostly instrumental with some vocal passages, think of Blast meeting Univers Zero with a sort Heavy Metal intention.Personally, I love this recording! But this is Progressive Rock - not something you would spin at a dance club or a ""Head-Banger's Ball""... This is purposeful, compositional music and very satisfying for a progressive music lover. 4 and a half stars really. Great spin!"
3,"Good, not great","This is not a bad album, but nothing on it really seems to capture me. Good songs include ""Curame"", ""Mi Corazon No Te Quiere,"" ""Te Voy A Dar,"" and the best song on the album ""Quiero Verte Mal."" The flaws on this album are some of the very simple lyrics and the lenth of the album, which only consist of eight songs, slightly over 30 minutes. But overall, a pretty good album."
4,One of the best books out there on HTML Period.,"This book in probably one of the best books out there on HTML. I had no experience with HTML yet had a web set up and running in less then a month. It will take you a while to read this book but your time will be worth while.The books offers numerious examples that will guide you in your efforts. All the example are highly helpful when you need a quick guide to help you with a particular project.One great effort of the book is the Table of Contents. Just by looking at the table of contents, you will learn all the different parts to the HTML options out there. After using this book, there are other options you will learn that converge from HTML. This includes Java, Perl, and CGI. This book give great intoductions to these platforms also.Jason"
2,Forget this book,"I was really disappointed with this book. The statement 'The only Html Book You'll need to develop your web site' is a lie. This book is more for beginners then for serious web developers. Examples in this book are simple and you will hardly have any use in real life application. I'm building web application and If you are looking for something it takes forever to find it in this book. If you don't want to waste your time and money, forget this book."
3,more of a beginner start-off then a reference,"i was looking for a comprehensive reference, and this being a ""black book"" and having a reader's level of ""INTERMEDIATE-ADVANCED"" seemed like it. but it wasn'tThe book is NOT built as a reference, and doesn't even have all the detailed info included on the methods/objects. chapters are built in more of a ""tutorial"" style then a reference (for example, having things like ""and then your boss sais: ""well, why don't you do it?"", and you say ""Great."" in the middle of a text is really not what a reference is about.Anyway, if you are a TOTAL beginner and want a comprehensive start-up manual - get this book, if you want a comprehensive REFERENCE - you can get a $7 softcover book that will be a lot more helpfull"
2,Poor Adhesive,The adhesive that hold the blue tabs in place does not hold them. The tabs pull off almost before use. Some are sliding off before use.
3,Restoration Manual MGB,"This book was in great condition, some of the photos are grainy and outdated, but overall the book is interesting and informative."
2,Ignore the review from Robert C Taylor,My copy is packed with essential information on purchase and body restoration. I have bought and restored two MGBs using this guide and in both cases got slightly better than I was expecting. Can't speak the the later issue entitled 'MGB Restoration Manual' but have been assured by others that it contains more or less the same information. It is an *essential* resource for anyone contemplating buying an MGB.
2,Not a Good Value,"This book isn't worth the money..it purports to be a restoration guide for MGB's, but its really a 300-page advertisement for Heritage's newly manufactured MG body shells. Rather than give extensive info on restoring your B, it just tells you how to bolt parts onto a new Heritage body....very dishonest title, disppointing book"
2,MGB Restoration Manual,"The introduction and section on buying an MG are very well done and useful. This section is probably worth the cost of the book. The sections on the restoration process is disappointing. The book has plenty of pictures, but they are so small and of mediocre quality that they aren't very useful. When explaining how to do various jobs, the book is somewhat superficial and wouldn't be of much help if someone really doesn't know how to do something. I find that the Official Workshop Manual is much more useful than the Restoration Manual."
3,MGB Resto Manual Review,"This book has been around for a good 15 years and is still one of the best on the topic of MGB restoration. The only flaw, and its a big one is that a lot of the photos are horrible; dark and hard to make out."
3,MGB Restoration Manual,"After receiving the book, I was really disappointed in the picture/illustration quality and size. The black & white pictures appear like they are a copy of a copy. Very dark, not very clear, fussy almost. Most pictures are small 2""x 2"", not what I expected in a manual of this subject. The text also lacked some detail/specifics, i.e. when it recommended a common bolt to replace an unavailable pivot pin, it didn't give the size and length. Things like this is what I was looking for in a restoration manual. I can figure out most things on my own, I was looking for some experienced insight and tip & tricks specific to my vehicle, not sure I got it with this book. If I've seen this book at the store before I could buy it, I may not have."
3,"Its a good book, but not a great book, but still a must have.","There is a lot of really good information in the book that is not in the workshop manuals. However, there is not a lot of explanation of the processes for some of the jobs in the book. Nevertheless, its still the best book of its kind. What I would like to seel is three or four more complete books covering separate phases of restoration in greater detail. Also, more coverage of the difference between different years would be great."
2,Not so much,"I was hoping this book would be helpful in replacing rusted out sills, pans, and side members. But no. It has some really small pictures and brief captions. There is a lot more to do prior to removing the above items. Too many pages about the history of the MGB. There may be some use for this book but I haven't found it yet. I get more help from the mgexperience site. [...]"
3,Decent but a bad port,"See, the Problem with this game is the choppy frame rate, the less then average graphics, and the poorly control system. They contribute to this game sucking compaired to its Arcade predicessor, If you want Daytona USA on your Sega Saturn, Pick up Championship Circuit Edition, It has 2 extra tracks, more cars, better graphics, 3D controller support, New soundtrack, better frame rate with less frame skip and the tracks are actualy labeled ;)Overall, this game was a shameful port but not completely terrible, it goes for about 5 bucks so its worth the money. but if you have 5 more dollars pick up Daytona USA CCE."
3,Nothing compared to the Arcade.,"Even to this day DAYTONA USA is my favorite Arcade game. It's still even found in arcades around the world ten years or so after it was released. The arcade may only have 3 tracks to choose from, but it is it's multi player compedativeness that has given it it's awsome fun.But bringing this game to the PC and Satrun did not bring the fun factor with it. It was pretty much the same game. There was a horse you could get if you won all races in a row (the arcade you actualy got a FWD type of car!) but the fun factow with the PC and Saturn versions where not there. The saturn version was only 2 players if you could hook it up to another Saturn.. and the PC version I think had a network game you could go to using the net, but I never tried it.It was too hard to control the cars with joypads, and even using a steerwheel joypad if you had one didnt make it anywhere near as much fun as the Arcade."
3,It is a text book!,"I find it helpful as a Spanish language learner that they define a number of the words that are not used in Spanish today. I wish I was more interested in hispanic literatura but so far I find most of the stories boring. I use this book in my required spanish lit class, so I had to buy it! Maybe by the end of the semester I find it more enlightening!"
4,Review regarding Aproximaciones,"Concise, organized, and full of everything you need. The footnotes are extremely helpful! I would definitely recommend this anthology for both scholars and students."
2,Error that makes the book very annoying to read for those language learners that know what they are doing,"The one thing that makes this book terrible and clearly for people to incompetent to look up words in the dictionary is that there are translations of words in the Spanish paragraphs. This means if you want to read nothing but Spanish you cannot, because there are always these little translations of words embedded in the paragraph. Next time authors, get it right, NO MIXING. Pure Spanish, or pure English, not some hideous hybrid that assumes I'm too stupid to deal with a 100% Spanish book. When your learning at this level you don't want a crutch, you want the pure language where English is no where in sight."
3,"I typed in the ISBN number to search for the book, and they gave me the wrong edition","I typed in the ISBN number originally, in order to search for the book. I then clicked on used books, and then they sent me the wrong edition of the book!"
4,Nice intro. to Spanish literature,"I used this book in a class at the University of NC. I actually liked the book & the class. It gives a nice overview of different literary periods and literature written during each one. It contains poesia, drama and narrativas."
5,Nice pop music from Holland,"Sandy Coast - very fine pop music from Holland.Great melodies on the 60's, 70's and 80's.Like Earth & Fire, as good as Shocking Blue.Booklet includes band information and single chartpositions."
1,Never Even Got To Play This Game!!!!!!,"I bought this Singles2 game from a seller on amazon a week ago, i got it and installed it, i was exciteed cause i love games like this. But when i started to play it the characters only had eyelashes and lips, nothing else, no body, head nothing! So i tried uninstalling it re-installing, this did not work, my laptop specs are perfect for this game so its not that. I emailed the seller, who didnt help much, bascially they said its not their fault, it was something got to do with my graphic card. Anyway, i downloaded an up to date graphic card driver, and still the characters were invisible. I went into a site on the net, and loads of people had the exact same problem with this game and no one has helped them. My advise is buy the game from a local shop near you so you can just go back and change it, now im stuck with a game i cant play.....NOT FAIR!"
1,Great Game!,"This was agreat game! Way better than the Sims. I loved it.And of course I thank baazar-direct for sending me the product when promised, it actually got to me 2 days early. Buying this game was the best on-line shopping experience i've had.Thankyou bazaar-direct and amazon."
5,Exciting ideas for leaders in the business world,"Great tips and ideas for motivating others, especially in the business world. Some of them include, ""Know Where Motivation Comes From, Teach Self-Discipline, Stop Criticizing Upper Management, Keep Giving Feedback, Get Input from your People, Accelerate Change, Don't Confuse Stressing Out With Caring, Manage Your Own Superiors, and Manage Agreements, Not People."" If you want to become a great leader, I highly recommend this book."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is awful. Here are a couple of lines of wisdom from the author - ""How do you motivate employees? Hire employees who are self-motivated."" And this priceless one ""you need to feed your own ego."" I recommend to anyone who wants to get help motivating individuals to read an autobiography from Colin Powell or Benjamin Franklin instead of this garbage."
2,Too abstract...,"The contents in this book is too abstract to apply these techniques.I think the books format should be the following for each motivation technique:Provide an example or a story about the technique, commentary about the technique, instructions on 'how to apply that technique' in easy to read recipe format."
2,Book could use some order or classification,"So, we have a list of 100 ways. Ways are more that ideas, they should bring together different parts of our motivation knowledge.These 100 ideas, don't seem to be in any particular order, and are therefore impossible to remember. (Unless we take the trouble to order them.) One order could be: ideas related to the communication process, related to vision, related to relation...There is no expression of relative importance of these ways / ideas.In short: messy and might be worth rewritingIdeas / ways are reasonable, so 2 stars."
3,Required for a course during my Master's Degree.,"""Motivating"" others is really just the spark that you can find in having someone else find a reason to do something.I may not have agreed with the totality of the book, but it is one of the books I retained. If it is a required book for you, it is not all that bad, but I would not buy it unless it was required.For what that is worth."
5,Very easy to pick and choose small habits to change,"This is a book that never should be put away on a shelf to get dusty. There are so many great ideas that include several that are very easy to implement. In that habits are what we are made of, the author challenges us as leaders and managers to change habits that do not motivate others and actually think about the impact of your actions and words. This is more of a reference book than a business book you read once and put away. When you need a little pick me up, pick a couple of it's ideas and experiment. In summary, all leaders and managers need to sharpen the saw with this book and get growing."
3,Seemed like fluff to me,To me this book seemed like a lot of fluff. It is my fault really - I should have looked at the size of the book and the number of pages. There are 100 ways to motivate others but each section barely has 2 small pages.Honestly it was a good book just not what I was looking for.
1,not for Super Capacity 465,"This receptacle kit does not fit Whirlpool Super Capacity 465 electric stovetop burner. I was trying to replace all four receptacles.The metal piece where the screw goes onto the stove is at a low angle. When I tried to correct the angle by bending it back, it broke off. It was very brittle, and not like what you would think in terms of a metallic plate. I had to jury-rig couple of the others along with the existing parts to make it work. I replaced two, and kept the other two originals with mix-and-match."
2,CMT?,"CMT saw blades are usually high quality items. So I figured a forstner bit should meet a similar standard. However, the points of the saw teeth cutting the outside diameter were not sharp at all. The bit had been cast, and the point and the inside blade had been sharpened, but the outside teeth were never sharpened after casting, and even had dull rounded edges on the points. I don't get it, if they are not going to sharpen the teeth, why can't they at least make a casting for these bits with sharp points? Neither the box, nor the bit, had CMT anywhere on it, and also there was no origin marks, but I expect they were made in China. I went ahead and filed a point on to the saw teeth, but used up a $5.00 file to do it since the bit had probably been heat-treated to hardness. Very disappointing. I don't care if CMT bids out work to other manufacturer's, but they should at least inspect the quality of the merchandise that is representing their brand."
2,Old Style Calypso,Great songs from the 50's . All of the music is good but lacks the quality of Today's accoustics.
1,Twice burned,"I purchased this item twice, thinking it would be much easier then drops or strips. The first time it worked about 3 weeks, when it stopped working (luckily I still checked with a strip!) and figured I had used it wrong. The second time it never worked at all. Dangerous to trust your fish to. Use the strips or the drops."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I bought two of these, and they gave completely different (and incorrect) readings. I'm not sure how this is possible with a good company like Seachem, but that was my experience. Don't risk your fish and waste your money!!!"
1,To hard to read,I used this for my fishless cycle to try to keep an eye on my pH. I only used it as a supplement to liquid testing and it was way off almost all of the time.
4,Spring Review,"Spring ParadeAt about age twelve I saw this film when it first came out. It so enchanted me, I never forgot it. Vienna, Old World Charm,its customs,dress,its music delighted me. At twelve I had not yet traveled or lived in Europe, learned any other languages, met any of their speakers or heard much classical music. I was at the brink of those things that would fill my life. Now, having lived much of my life in that world, the film no longer has quite the same appeal. Nevertheless, I feel fulfilled at having my memory of the film refreshed and will enjoy watching it again from time to time."
3,Solid.,"This is a solid effort, but there are definetely games on the market that do this better. If you liked the arcade version, yo will probably like this, but it is only worth a rental or purchase in a bargain bin."
4,Regency reference book,Now I can tell whether a Regency author has done her research properly. I'll know as much as she does.
4,Not just for Georgette Heyer fans,"You don't have to love Georgette Heyer to enjoy this thorough account of Regency England's people, places, pastimes, customs and costumes. History enthusiasts, Jane Austen devotees, admirers of the Romantic poets, period writers, and maybe even researchers will find a lot of information to enhance their interests. There's a comprehensive timeline that stretches from 1738, when George III is born, to 1830, when George IV dies, in one of the appendixes that I know I will be coming back to again and again."
2,Nothing extra to the books themselves,"As someone who has read all the regency Georgette Heyer books several times, this didn't add anything to what I'd already learned from the books themselves. I was hoping for more detail and background on the wider world of the Regency, but actually each chapter was just a summary of what was in the books, grouped by theme. For example, a section on transport listed the main types of carriages, gave a brief synopsis of each, and referred to an occasion in one of the stories where that carriage was used. There was nothing new for me here."
1,Pathetic Beyond Words,"The author, Jennifer Kloester, evidently took this subject as her PhD. dissertation topic. One can only hope that the dissertation itself was something other than the text provided here. If there is an original thought, expression, or source in this book I will eat my hat and yours too. By page 40, enough ignorant takes on Heyer's text have stacked up that the average book reviewer would howl.The illustrations are beyond bad and appear to be an attempt to avoid paying for use of originals.I am virtually at a loss for words to express how completely useless this book is.The title of this bundle of pages should be _The Slaughter of Innocent Trees to No Purpose_, or something more pointedly defamatory about the quality of the author's intellectual and scholarly skills.Do Not buy this book. Instead, read the fun, witty and enchanting Heyer books themselves, and then read some original sources, or the many historiographical books available on the topic."
3,It's ok.,"The target audience - fans of Georgette Heyer's regency novels - will find this book redundant. There is very little new information for a consistent reader of GH. The drawings, though sweet, are a trifle boring.And if you're not a fan of GH or regency novels, you may find yourself at sea. The author assumes a lot of background knowledge about GH and the regency - and if you already have that background information, you don't need this book.I expected it to be more informative about the regency period itself. Maybe some authentic regency illustrations, etc.It's an okay read, but something of a waste of money and time."
5,korean red ginseng,I have found that this brand delivers a great amount of Korean Red Ginseng and works very well. It may take a week or two to feel the effects but you definitely will feel it working. Delivery was fast and price is very reasonable and competitive.
4,Psalm 23,Haddon Robinson knows how to preach. In this small paperback you are exposed to sermons that are solid exegetically yet speak to the heart. One of the best ways to learn about Psalm 23 while feeding your own soul is to go through this book while allowing this book to go through you. Much that is written on Psalms is devotional but inaccurate; you won't encounter that problem here.
1,Not for those on blood thinners,"Nowhere in this description did it mention that these vitamins are dangerous to those on blood thinners. Only after I had purchased the item with premium shipping and it arrived at my door did I see a warning label telling anyone who is on blood thinning medication or who is a hemopheliac that they must not take this product. My eyes are very bad -- I was lucky that I spotted the warning because I have a bleeding problem. My doctor -- who told me to purchase these -- had no idea it was a risk for those who are on blood thinners. It is right there on the bottle -- but not in the advertising. Very important information to leave out. This was a waste of money that I can't afford, as I'm on social security."
4,Great Vitamin,"I have been taking these for about 2 years as recommended by my doctor, they really help with your energy level. They are easy to order via amazon but difficult to find in stores. The look of the bottle changed recently with this order so I was a tad sceptic but all of the ingredients are the same except they are now gluten free."
1,PolyVytamyns,I ordered this product because my physician recommended it. I took it for three weeks before realizing that it was making me feel HORRIBLE. I felt like a zombie until I discontinued using the product. Would not recommend this to anyone.
2,"misleading. It's a Philly-downtown map, not a map for Philadelphia traveling.","When I received this map I felt the brief on Amazon was misleading. This map is not for who wanna a drive guide in Philly, but for those who want to walk in the downtown area @ Philly. It's a kind of art work, but it can not meet my needs. Amazon should give it more detailed descrption.Generally, misleading. It's a Philly-downtown map, not a map for Philadelphia traveling."
2,Frequent traveller,"We always carry one of the Mapeasy maps if one is available for our destination. It saves a lot of time finding places and shopping - something we plan ahead for eg if I need a new pair of Hiking Shoes I study the Net and list where I want to go and generally find the shops on Mapeasy.However, it is essential to take a Rand McNally or similar with you."
5,A remarkble book!,I think people that need to read a funny book should pick Ribbon Rescue because it is funny. In the story my favorite character is Jillian. I like all his pictures and that book reminds me of Mexico. The funny part was when the bride was on the bike. I recommend this book to kids.
3,Ribbon Rescue was great,This was a great book because the little girl helped a lot of adults. My favorite part was when she helped the family wrap the presents. My favorite character was the man because he did not have his shoes on his feet. The book reminds me of my little sister helping my big sister. I would read this book to my little sister because she is kind.
5,WHAT A GREAT BOOK !!!!!,"I think 4 year olds thru 10 year olds should read Ribbon Rescue because it is funny, silly and a very good book to read. I also think when you read this book you are going to tell all your friends about the book. I would like to say that all of you girls who love dresses should buy this book and thank you Robert Munsch and Jillian."
4,Ribbon Rescue Is A Very Good Book,Ribbon Rescue is a fun book full of surprises like the bride and the groom being late to their own wedding. It is a book for all ages that teaches kids that helping people is a nice thing to do. The main character is a little girl named Jillian who takes off her ribbons from her dress to help people on the way to the wedding. I recommend this book to little girls who like ribbons and helping people but everyone could read it.
4,This book is offensive !!!,"I found this book to be utterly offensive and I would not have it in my home nor my classroom.The book teaches children that adults who are about to be married are careless, unkempt and tardy. What kind of lesson is that? What does this teach children about the sanctity of the marriage ceremony?The book shows a CHILD rescuing ADULTS !The book shows a CHILD speaking to strangers.The book shows an adult male (presumably the preacher) not allowing a CHILD into the church because her clothes were dirty!And why are we having church related themes in a public school!?This book gets a big fat F from me!"
1,Decal is sticky and tacky! Fabric is okay but the Decal is horrible!,Do not purchase this product. I am still waiting for a response from the company or retailer. The decal is very sticky on the back; it will stick to the shower curtain liner... tacky to the touch.
1,Ow..my ears!,Yikes....come on...tone deaf? Calling this anything other than noise is just unimaginable. It's only 5 stars because the same guy rated it 5 stars over and over.
5,a manifesto for the human economy,"A really stimulating book this, and the vanguard of the fresh Scanadanvian business perspective we keep reading about. I was attracted by the funky jacket, and this impulse purchase paid off. This book is all about immersing yourself in the underlying spirit of the human economy - think of it as the new manifesto for companies and individuals who can compete on being different and compete on economies of soul. What it is not is a bandwagon book about the dot com ""new economy"". This is about diversity, creativity and competing on personality. Like the Cluetrain Manifesto and No Logo, this won't deliver a big checklist, but it will make you think differently about business. Funky Business might even just make you feel excited about business life again. When's the last time a business book made you feel that?"
1,all flash no substance,"After reading this book all I can say is ""so what?"". Yeah sure the world is changing, fast, old rules don't apply, heard that a 1000 times before, but what the authors fail to do is give insight into what might work, where they think this fast paced future is taking us. The only insight was is borrowed quotes and clichés. Kinda like reading cotton candy."
3,Buy the Original,Since the first Funky Business book was published their next two books: Karaoke Capitalism and Funky Business Forever has been a repeat of the same ideas and examples that was presented in the original.I would only recommend that you buy this book if you missed out on the first.
4,Different Perspectives,"If you want to see things -business or normal life- from different perspectives, then this is the book to choose!"
1,Twisty language beguiles the easily amused,"The influences are clear: rock journalism, pampleteering, dot-com uber capitalism and some basic ideas about markets. Spice up some old ideas from Tom Peters and Charles Handy with energizing language and lo and behold a bestselling book. This is an example of style well over content, language used to beguile and entrance without saying anything at all. Reading this thoroughly i cannot find a single original idea in this book. If this is cutting-edge thinking, business is in serious trouble."
1,"I NEED ALL YOUR HELP, PLEASE !","Hi world! I'm an spanish student, from the University of Barcelona, and I'd like to become a good occupational psychologist, a really good one. One of my favorites teachers told me about this book, ""Funky bussines"", anb I'd like to know some more about it. Could please any of you tell me how to write an e-mail to JONAS RIDDERSTRALE or KJELL NORDSTROM? Thank you very much, people of the world !!!"
3,So-so dance jam mix,"This compilation features ""amazing hits"" from such ""audio wizards"" as Technotronic, Snap, and, best of all, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. I mean, who can't help but ""feel the bum rush"" when they listen to such classics as ""Bust A Move"" by Young M.C.? Who can resist the genius lyrics from Technotronic's ""Pump Up The Jam"" (""Get yo' booty on the floor tonight/Make my day"") Ok, so this stuff isn't actually any good. As much as I try, I just can't seem to pump up enough jam to enjoy this at all. Even Cathy Dennis's intelligent ""Touch Me (All Night Long)"" can't rise my spirits. The rest of the compilation is just as horrible as what I've already mentioned (with the exception of ""Pump Up The Jam,"" which is just plain funny). So, listen up Entertainment Weekly, you entertain very weakly. (I couldn't help myself.)"
2,"Numbers too small to read, especially if the room is not well lit.","The numbers arre too small to read, especially in a room that is not well lit or if you are not in the sunlight. I thought that it would display the date constantly, which it does not. I cannot even find in the instruction book where it shows how to bring up the date. My Timex, though not an atomic watch, was much easier to read and gave you the time, date, day, seconds and automatically lit up at night. Price wise, it was about half the price of this watch."
4,great watch for simple outdoor enthusiasts,"i got this watch mainly because it's atomic and water resistant. i have used this snorkeling in bahamas and in st.croix as well as in the swimming pool. it withstood the waters! i have had this watch for over 3 years now and i haven't replaced the batteries as of yet. i have small wrist but it fits perfectly for me. the atomic feature works well when i am anywhere in america but not when i am in canada. my woe to it is its radio/receiver that isn't capable of receiving transmission from japan and germany towers to synch time, which i wish should have been part of its feature as it is helpful for a world traveller (i guess the multiple city support in the digital time takes care of that). also, i don't like the orangey color of the backlight."
3,Beautiful but not very functional,"I was afraid this watch would be too big for my wrist, and was pleasantly surprised to see how nice it looked. My disappointment came with trying to read the watch, especially at night. It does illuminate the face but you cannot see any of the round displays. If you are wanting a watch that you can glance at to see the time, this isn't it. It would have been better if they had made the hands a ""glow in the dark"" type so you could glance at night and see the time, and if the lighting were to illuminate behind the round displays you could see everything at night, instead it shines up from the base of the face, and doesn't really make it any easier to see. In the bright daylight, everything can be seen with no problems. So this is a big beautiful watch, but it doesn't have the functionality I had hoped for."
3,Casio Women's Baby G Atomic Timekeeping Watch,"Beautiful and elegant....however, this watch has been a pain. The time keeping part gains time, can not set it where it needs to be and is just off and it really should be a much more accurate time piece. It made me so mad I ended up going to wal-mart and getting a darn Timex. I really wanted this watch....now I really would like my $$$ back or at least a different one that works right."
3,Tough to keep the white clean!,"I love the look and feel of this watch. It is beautiful..BUT! It is sooooo hard to keep the watch band clean, particularly the little loop that holds the watchband down. That rubs on everything and gets dirty so fast! That makes me sad because I love this watch dearly. I will think twice about getting a white watch again."
4,Happy watch!,"I received this today and was a little shocked by the wide white brightness of the band. It looks somewhat opaque blue in the picture, but is actually bright bright white as described. I guess it could be changed if my vanity overcomes me. On the other hand, it took 2 seconds to figure the multitude of cool gadgets out and THE coolest thing is seeing the hands of the watch turn by themselves when you select which city you live in. So fun!I had an officer's Swiss Army watch for ten years before it suddenly stopped working- instead of getting it fixed (no it wasn't a battery issue) I thought I could use in my life as a mother/graduate student/ etc. etc. a watch with an alarm , date, timer... I am glad to make the transition to practicality (at least with my watch)."
4,Too Big,Really like the functions of the watch and the style. I read the reviews but thought I would give it a chance. I did return it because it really is too big for me. If Casio would come out with a smaller version of it I will be the first to buy it. Really wish Amazon would show pictures of watches next to a ruler to get a idea of true size.
3,Review,"The description of this watch said ""small"". The face was too big for my petite wrist. I had to return it."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY- NO MANUAL -CHARGE FOR SUPPORT-NO REVERSE,The sprinkler goes only clockwise .Wont turn back at the end of the cycle. It came without manual and they charge for online manual or support.Gave one star because they dont have 0 star. recommend to stay away from this product and this company.
1,"Bought two, both had their main spikes snap off in the ground","Up until they broke, these were good sprinklers. We live in central Texas, and have reasonably good dirt, but both of these sprinklers ended up snapping off the larger main spike while being inserted into the ground. Note that the sprinkler is designed with a platform for you to use your foot to push it into the ground, but the spikes appear to be relatively low-grade aluminum, and simply snap off if there is any resistance. Both went in the trash within a season."
2,"Good coverage, but not durable","This sprinkler has excellent coverage which is what I was looking for. However, the first time I used it the tip of the large metal spike broke off as I was pushing it into the ground. The company was quick to replace it. However, the same thing happened with the second sprinkler I was sent. Not very happy."
2,"Great for beginners, but . . .","This is a great book for beginning Echo students or someone who just wants a simple overview of Echo. But, if you are an Echo tech that wants a much more advanced reference this is not it. Doesn't go into advanced cardiac abnormalities or congential diseases."
3,Somewhat confusing,"What was formerly a useful board review book has been crippled by the amount of idiotic errors it contains. If you spend hundreds of hours studying for a test, you would like your review book to be a trustworthy source of information. Because of the amount wrong information in first aid, I now second guess everything I don't understand in the book and have to spend time going to secondary sources to verify.I found these 2 to be much better resources:http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Clinical-Echocardiography-Enhanced-Features/dp/1437727654/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid;=1344539732&sr;=8-5&keywords;=Echocardiographyhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TH4A5G"
4,Echo IS made easy,Echo Made EasyThis book has helped me to better understand echocardiography. It explains in simple terms and it's an easy read. It is small and travels well. I take it with me and read when I have a little time to kill. I only wish I had bought it sooner.
2,too basic,I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. the book proved to be too basic even for me as a beginner.
4,Great for beginners,Great for beginners. Showed it to a few people and they also pirchsed the book. One department ordered it at the request of their experienced techs.
5,Just As the Title Implies!,"Just as the title implies, this easy to understand paperback on echocardiology gives students and clinicians the basics to use as building blocks in understanding the more technical textbooks on the complex subject."
2,Echo can not be easy!,"Echo has a long learning journey: in fact, it is not easy at all! And this is another book that only serves to prove it. Sistematic review of cardiological pathologies, but insufficient to rule begginer's first steps into echo. Not practical nor reasonable step by step approach- describes 2-D features with the same detail that tissue doppler imaging, per example."
5,Ritchie Blackmore and Sophia Loren all wrapped up in one !,"No this isn't a perfect compilation and that speaks to the strength of material there is to choose from. This draws from the RCA years ie: Lita, Stiletto and Dangerous Curves. Included are the obvious hits , Kiss Me Deadly, Close My Eyes Forever and Shot of Poison. Included as well are the rockers, The Ripper and Hellraiser and some choice album cuts. Truth is the original Best of Lita was a better compilation but this is a bargain price title and some great notes, cool photos and excellent remastering make this more than worth the price. Lita is always a great listen! Enjoy!"
2,Lita Rocks! but this collection should be better.,"I just put the cd in and the very begining of KISS ME DEADLY is cut off. Not a good sign.I wish they would have added :LARGER THAN LIFE, GOTTA LET GO, OUT FOR BLOOD,LISA, DRESSED TO KILL and usd the remix/single versions of BACK TO THE CAVE, SHOT OF POISON, CLOSE MY EYES FOREVER, FALLING IN AND OUT OF LOVE & HUNGRY.For such a beautiful woman, they should have used better photos. Two are from a video shoot and 2 are live concert shots. Lita had a ton of promo photos that could have/should have been used.A few of the songs shouldn't even be on here such as THE RIPPER, BAD LOVE & LITTLE BLACK SPIDER, but record companies truly don't care about product, so I guess as long as Lita is retired, this is all we'll get from her-reissues."
5,Rock Queen,Excellent compilation- not a filler track on it. All the favourites & standout Sweet cover with Hellraiser. Great cover shot & informative sleeve notes. Well packaged product & prompt service considering distance traveled. One of my Top 10 cd's.
1,It didn't work for me.,"No matter how hard I would swing the mallet, the corner bead didn't grab. I ended up using screws to hold the corner bead on."
4,The wife loved it,"I bought this for my wife as a birthday gift. She recently bought a ratty old copy of the first film on VHS at a yard sale & instead of dragging the VCR out of the closet I figured why not just get her the DVD and throw the tape in the trash. I was delighted to find that I could get all three movies for the price of one. I'm not really familiar with the Free Willy series, unless you count the occasional ""Free Willy"" sexual innuendo joke, but this is a pretty good bargain for some good clean wholesome family entertainment."
5,Great collection,I was thrilled to find all three Free Willy films in one collection for such a great price. I'm truly a Willy fan!
5,Great Collection!,This is a great collection. Bought it for my grandchildren and they have spent many hours watching each of the 3 movies over and over.
1,BAD,I CAN'T SEE THE SECOND PART. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. IT SAID ON THE DESCRIPTION THAT IT WAS IN GREAT SHAPE LIKE NEW. BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE
5,GREAT buy!,"My daughter is only 2 and absolutely loves the ""Willy movies,"" as she calls them. This was a great buy for all three movies. Thank you!"
5,The Free Willy Collection Review,Excellent box set of the Free Willy Movies. Hard to find in stores. The kids loved all three movies.
1,Exortation to Peace and Unity,I have read all of Bunyan's works and I am 100% sure that he did not write this book. This book was found among his writings after his death and was included in his complete works. It is NOT his work.
1,Needs to be updated,This was a great book I thought until I got to Rio. I bought this book because it was the most recently published (2000). On more than one occasion the book contained dated material. The best example was the Japanese restaurant that was supposed to be in the hotel where I stayed. I was suprised to find out it closed over 2 years ago. Go with the Lost Planet guide. At least they tell you that their information is two years old.
5,Very Cute,Looks like something from the past when kids could ride their cars in their striped t-shirts and jeans. Guess it was an nicer time in the world and this car brings back fond memories. Arrived in PERFECT condition!
2,dozens,"ok, this is a cute little book. funny dialogue, a few believable characters.but too many holes kill the plot. (as it were.) lot of laughs, espcially from curt's buddy denis. shaky love scenes and talk. but the story doesn't move. it's a collection of days in an 18-yr old boy's life, and debrie wants us to make it stick together somehow. not much help from the author there.sometimes the talk between curt and friends deteriorates into joke after joke. (editing, editing.) the humor works. for a while.just an ok debut."
5,Britney Spears Overprotected single with interveiw,"A must have for all Britney Spears fans. Its great to collect all different remixs / versions of Britney's songs.1)album version - 3:18 - This is a great song with a strong beat. 2nd single released from the album 'Britney'2)JS16 remix - 6:07 - This remix is very different from the original song. It is mostly Beat with a few repeated lyrics.3)JS16 Dub - 5:24 - This remix is fairly similar to the JS16 remix, but has a stronger beat and less lyrics.4)interveiw - 6:12 - Britney is asked questions about her music and writing songs etc.5)Enhanced movie Trailer - trailer for britney's film crossroads"
3,mmm... ok.,"Britney's special European single 'Overprotected' from her latest album ""Britney"" is a very serious song. ""Overprotected: Track 1"" Is probably the best track on this. The JS16 remix is really bad. It only says part of the chorus and repeats it over and over again. I wish they would have put the american video version as they play on Mtv's TRL It is a really good remix video {I think} by Jazzy Jim (who remixed her ""Crazy""). The JS16 Dub is just a short instrumental of the JS16 Remix. If I were you, I'd just buy the Overprotected/I'm a slave 4 u England single because 1) It's cheaper 2) Contains The 3 tracks on this one and last 3) Has a special interview, I'm a slave for you (Thunderpuss Radio Mix) and (Album Version). It would be better if it had the ""Overprotected"" Video but thats on the ""I'm not a girl"" single. Buh-Bye"
1,Defnitely not a reasonable racing simulation.,"I have played a lot of racing simulations in the past, but when it comes to this one, I would never like to play it again. The graphics aren't too well done. The bikes handling and control are also a real problem. If you try and go into a curve on the inside and just TRY to move a slight amount to the right, it moves to the right a lot more than you hoped for and usually crashes into the wall. With only about 3 or 4 courses to try, you'll go through them pretty quickly, especially when they really aren't too well designed.. Grand Prix mode is even worse. The rider has to pit every three laps, even on a very short course. Hang-On GP always reminds me of a few arcade games that weren't too well done, either. If you're looking for a reasonable superbike racing simulation, I usually recommend Manxx TT Superbike. An imperfect racing sim with only one or two weak spots."
2,A generic lack of effort,"First off, I's like to start by saying I was never a big apop fan. Being a listener and fan of industrial and ebm for quite a while now, It saddens me to see music mislabeled as ebm or industrial. Apop always had strong ebm roots but starting with this album they have started to merge towards the poppy sounding Techno like, band I expected them to become like. Which is fine. Over all I found this album lacking and boring with little reply value."
3,"Good singles, but lots of filler","This album marked a change in sound for this Norwegian band. The harder and darker elements of their earlier work are largely gone, replaced instead by punchy, techno-influenced beats and more current synth work. As with most Apop albums, there are a handful of very strong tracks (Eclipse, the Icon of Coil-penned Starsign, Kathy's Song, and a cover of Metallica's ""Fade to Black"" which inadvertantly nicks the piano line from U2's ""New Year's Day""), and a lot of unremarkable filler tracks. Would've made a brilliant EP, but instead makes a merely decent album. Still, probably one of their strongest."
3,A Few Good Songs,"Apop are a bunch of arrogant, primadonna, popgoths and I hate 'em. Still, they make half-way decent music and this is probably their best album. Kathy's song is lovely (although VNV Nation kicked this song's [rear-end] on the single), Starsign and Eclipse are good to dance to, and Fade to Black is a difficult song to cover, but Apop pulled it off. This album should be in any Goth's collection purely for the sake of completion, but I don't think it will turn many heads."
3,A mixed bag,"This is a different sound for Groth. ""7"" was pretty aggressive EBM, and ""Welcome to Earth"", while much better-produced, is more uneven as an album.It has some truly stellar tracks, like ""Starsign"" , ""Eclipse"" and ""Paranoia"", all of which fall into that hazy land where EBM and synthpop collide. There's the exceptionally poppy yet intruiging ""Come Lie Next to Me."" The good stuff is really good.And the mediocre stuff is really mediocre. One track is essentially a dead-ripoff of the theme from Twin Peaks, minus the creepy ambience of the original. ""Help Me"" overindulges in bizzare effects to the detriment of the song. ""Soultaker"" is an attempt at a thrashy industrial song that doesn't quite cut it.If you liked Covenant's ""USoM"" and ""Europa"", you may want to pick this up just for the excellent tracks. If you're a synthpop fan loking for something more agressive, this'll be fine. If you're trying to find the next Skinny Puppy, you're looking in the wrong place."
2,Just fragments,"This is an incredibly popular album so I'm going against the grain I guess, but after listening to it a few times I began to notice something odd... There are catchy melodies all over the place, excellent accomplished vocals, great beats, but ... no ... SONGS. It's like he had a lot of talent, sure, and a bunch of great ideas for PARTS of songs, but it just never gets to the point where the whole song comes together in one coherant unit. I realized that's why I always find this album kind of unsatisfying. In contrast, consider VNV nation's Empires or Project Pitchfork's Daimonion, to name just two examples. Those albums are replete with good solid songwriting. They start with an idea, which Apop has plenty of, then REALIZE it, which Apop never quite manages to do.Also, what's up with all that ridiculous alien business? I hope they're being ironic or something because if not, they need to ease up on the hallucinogens a tad."
5,APB are lords of industrial dance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a very great cd a cool vibe with a ET look at the world in this cd you can hear that apb lets the listener know that ther is much more than just a planet earth out ther and that we as people shuld consider it!!!!i love this band ther just as good as any other acts out ther way better than anything on mtv!!!apb does not need mtv anyway the got a graet fan support anyway get this one its a must very dancy!!!!and butiful at the sametime its all aboute the ECLIPSE
3,Nice intro to APB,"I wish I'd listen to this one before _7_. It's less intense than the latter, and I would recommend it for anyone with a beginners' interest in industrial music. Notable tracks include ""Moment of Tranquility"" with a nice borrowing of _Twin Peaks_ main theme. ""Kathy's Song"", ""Fade to Black"" as well as ""Eclipse"" are also worthy of mention."
3,a nice refresh change ! but with a poor vibe,"well as a APB fan 7 was the best cd and when i heard Welcome to Earth lets just say in the start it was very poor and diapontment . the cd is cut out to two half the cd is great the second poor the cd leak of dark vibe sound and its doesnt cover anything that alredy made in EBM still there are well done songs like LNDP3 and untitled 3 , Moment of Tranquility if you dont have to dont buy it !!"
5,WHat a bear hunter needs to read,"very nice book easy to read, the guy tells a story of his life and you can learn alot from his stories."
2,A little too much for me!,"I am very interested in bears and have purchased several books on the subject in the past year. I am not a hunter, but fully understand the need for the sport and am neither for or against it. However, when the author of this book describes how he hunted down a sow bear and as an extra bonus ""put a bullet through the head"" of it's cub trying to excape down a tree, I even became repulsed and put down the book. Scenarios like this are replayed throughout the book to the extent that it obviously becomes a sick obsession. Your better off without it."
4,"A very easy, simple treat","Ferrets love this as much as ferretone. It is a sweet paste instead of an oil though and can be used as a hunger booster if you are changing food or your ferret is sick. A warning though, it should be used sparingly as it contains sugar, which prolonged use will increase the risk of insolinoma."
1,:( :( :( BUYER BEWARE! :( :( :(,"This little unit had such great potential! Everything I was looking for! Bought it in early June 2005. I loved it! It worked GREAT for 3 months- and one of those 3 months shouldn't even count - I was on vacation all of July, and didn't use it. Now at the end of September, it SUDDENLY (no warning whatsoever)crapped out on me. Can't even use the radio part of it because of the nasty snapping noise the CD door makes. Now I'm either out $60 or I pay to send it back to RCA, and figure out if they are going to replace it with a new or refurbished unit."
1,"Ditto, ditto, ditto","My husband purchased two of these pieces of junk because he got a ""good deal"". The first one had problems with the CD door clicking off the bat so I stopped using the cd player. The rest of it worked for about a year and one day everything on the display lit up and froze. Since it was too late to return it, I thought I'd try the other one. It only took two weeks and the display on that one froze as well. I wrote to RCA and they were of no help at all."
1,Bad product...,"Bought this item from Best Buy because it was the only one they carried that had all the features I wanted, or at least claimed it did. First, one I bought the display didn't work at all. Returned it for another, which worked better than the first but still skipped badly when playing CD-R's, even though both RCA's and Best Buy's website say it should. Decided to give it one more try and returned it again and even checked in the store to make sure it would play CD-R's, which it did, for a while. When I brought it home it played about half a CD-R and them started skipping again. I won't be fooled a fourth time and hopefully, you won't be fooled at all. This product is badly designed and/or poorly produced. Don't buy it..."
2,Broken already,"On paper this looks like a great featured alarm clock, but it has a lot of problems. The controls are not very intuitive. The placement of buttons makes it easy to accidentally change settings when trying to hit snooze. Next, as others have mentioned, the cd player makes a lot of noise. If you are waking up to a cd and hit snooze the cd keeps spinning and it's rather loud. Overall the audio seems poor, but that's probably normal for a cd alarm clock.Most importantly the mechanical door now makes several loud clicking noises (gears slipping) when closing, turning the power on, anytime the cd is played, or when the alarm goes off.I got a lot of joy smashing this. Waking up to load clicks really sucks."
2,Frustrated,"This clock radio has (or rather had) so much potential! I went through several brands and models before I settled on this one and I was so excited that this one had pretty much everything I was looking for. It served me well for 5 months and then... suddenly... it started making strange noises when you plug it in, try to do anything with the CD player, or even turn it off - an annoying clicking sound I am assuming is related to the CD player. I'm stuck with it for now, but buyer beware...."
1,Worst clock radio I have ever had,"The CD door does not open/close properly and makes a horrible and incessant clicking sound. I would have returned it but I thought my toddler messed up the door by pulling on it. But I have since heard that others have had same problem - even the store display had a problem with the door. Also, snooze button is hard to find. Not user friendly clock/radio."
3,Mixed review,"The service received in the receipt & return of this product from Amazon has been excellent, however,the actual product (I have owned two of them) seems to be lesser quality than one should be able to expect from RCA). Very complicated & not consistent in operation.We were surprised & delighted to open the mail today & find a check that compensated us for the postage spent in returning product. Thank you Amazon."
3,Clicking noise and door closing problems solved,"My wife has owned her radio for about 5 years. Two weeks ago, the door began to make a clicking noise as it closed over the CD. My son found that this noise could be stopped if a shim was placed under the door. To the best of my knowledge, a shim about 3/16th of an inch thick worked for her door. You can use a few popsicle sticks stacked upon each other, and taped together, and then taped into place where the bottom of the door tries to go, should do it. The sticks should be small enough to sit on the bottom without sticking out, so that the door can more fully open when it wants to open, but is prevented from fully setting down to the bottom when it wants to close. This shim should be taped into place so that it does not fall out, etc."
3,"A nice graphical improvement, but not much else.","This game is a nice visual improvement over its Genesis counterpart. The gameplay is good, but not as easy to control as I would haved hoped. There is lots of sloppiness, and even some slowdown, which really hurts the game. It is also very poor when compared to its Playstation and N64 versions. They have better graphics and gameplay."
3,Where's the dance?,"The CD is well recorded, and the performances are passionate and sincere. However, the driving and wild character of Ginastera's fast Gaucho dances are often lost by the use of excessive rubato and pedal, as in Malambo or Creole Dance. Some of the tempos are arbitrary - for instance in the Twelve American Preludes, where Ginastera goes into extra troubles when he writes metronome markings and the total duration in minutes and seconds of each Prelude.The most enjoyable interpretations of this CD are the slower, more expressive movements, such as the Danza de la Moza Donosa (from Three Argentine Dances), performed with romantic warmth, and Cuyana, the first movement of the rarely performed Tres Piezas."
3,flash bangs,"there weren't nearly enough flash bangs used in the apprehension of suspects. i know these are based on real crimes, but everyone knows if flash bangs are used, criminals rarely repeat offend. Also telescoping batons are pretty cool and in the hong kong gang episode i could hardly help but notice no mention of tiger claws repelling gear or the use of crane style kung fu. Its absence was most unexpected and disappointing. I did however like the visuals of early 90s Starter jackets in the Chicago gangs episode. But seriously, more flash bangs."
3,"Good treats, but could use more variety","After occasionally buying Jones Natural treats for my dog at an over-priced dog boutique, I decided to give this variety pack a try. Although the description indicates the bag will contain some combination of hooves, ribs, grizzles, bacon rolls, ear slices and bully sticks, the bags I purchased had mostly hooves, ribs, pig ears, and a few grizzles, but no bacon rolls or bully sticks. My dog will not eat hooves as they are too hard for him to chew, but a friend's giant rottie enjoyed them and apparently one hoof lasted a few days. My dog loved the pig ears, but since they are so fattening I would have liked a better assortment in this bad."
5,"A book any age will love, toddler or adult.","This is a great little book that your toddler or grandchild will love. Any adult can read it years later & smile with the fond memories it brings to mind. Well worth the money, makes a nice little shower gift, too."
4,Great book with cute illustrations!,Perfect board book for my niece to enjoy with her daddy. It is hard to find board books showing African American families.
5,Great Book for Toddlers,"My son LOVES this book and so do I. The main character is such an adorable boy. This book does a great job of incorporating every baby's favorite game, Peekaboo and learning new words. The main character interacts with all my son's favorite words: mommy, daddy, grandma, grandpa, butterfly, puppy, bunny, train, etc. My son's 16months old now and I let him chose his bedtime book. Peekaboo Morning gets read every other night."
5,A must hear!,Rich lyrics that hum in your ears for days. The upbeat rhythm is very good for driving. No personal cd catalog is complete without this album.
4,Excellent Introduction and Resource,"This book has great introductory information laid out in a format that is clear and easy to understand. It presents information on the theories behind Chaos Magic, good resources to followup on, and interesting information on different forms that magic can take. The information is clear, well laid out, and well written so that it is an easy read.That being said...At the beginning of the book it almost sounds like Hine is preaching rather than informing. There is also a lack of an index in the book, making it a poor referance despite being an excellent straight through read and guide.All in all I recommend this book highly despite its (few and far between) flaws."
4,Nothing is true...everything permitted.,"This book has a lot of good information to get you started using Chaos magick. If you've done magickal work before and are the sort of person who clings to rules and magick as an exact science, this book will rattle a few cages. But, take what you want, use it, and see what happens.Techniques are thoroughly explained. Theory is touched on but, as well as I remember, not too deeply.A good book to use to expand your magickal world. To me, not as good as those by Jan Fries and the one by Jaq D. Hawkins, but good none the less"
3,A good intro,"This is a great book for those just getting into magic. Just like any other introduction, to make it easy for a new student, it doesn't go much into depth and technical detail. This is why I am giving a three."
3,"YES WELL, NO FINE!","I found some parts of this book far more interesting than others, like the core principles of chaos magic, its history and the chapter on servitors with its practical exercises. Chaos magick's non-dogmatic eclectic approach is quite appealing. The section on Ganesh is also helpful, but unfortunately the author sometimes displays some arrogance in ""dissing"" other paths and movements. Which brings me to a modern metaphysical author like Stuart Wilde, who while not claiming to be a magician, covers the same ground plus much more. And when I had finished the book, I came to the conclusion that one can achieve all you want by studying and applying the guidance of the old metaphysicians like Dr Joseph Murphy and Catherine Ponder, without having to bother with rituals and stuff. But ""Condensed Chaos"" is still an interesting read and I enjoyed the references to Robert Anton Wilson and Discordianism."
2,FALCON PRESS ALERT!! BEWARE...,"From what I have been able to read on the net, this book is an expanded version of an earlier book by the author. Most people seem to think the ""shorter"" version was better. Definitely find a copy of this book and look through it before buying."
5,best book on magic available,"This is a great book! Plain and simple. :) It is full of great insights and reflects the varied background of the author. No bogus authoritarian decrees about how things must be done here. The whole point is that magic only works if the practice of it stirs something within you, and that is a very personal thing. No one else's system will produce the sort of results you can achieve if you develop something of your own. In particular, the chapter on Ego magic is fantastic. Here you will find all sorts of suggestions for dumping baggage and becoming less hindered by ego identification. I guess one of the best things I can say is this is one of the few magic books that I have bothered to read TWICE. :) Get it. You won't be sorry."
5,"A solid, well argued, practical guide to ""chaos"" magick","Looking for insight, intelligence and common sense in your guides to magickal work? Then look no further than Phil Hine, world-renowned practitioner of magick, both Chaos and otherwise. Condensed Chaos is more than a good introducition to Chaos magick theory; it's a vital and comprehensible introduction to the broad sweeep of magickal practice. Phil's style is common-sense, practical, informed and above all, human. His magickal experience covers everything from Wicca to Tantra and he has pushed forward technical Chaos as much as anyone. This gives him an excellent perspective from which to survey both beginners' and advanced chaos, and qualifies Condensed Chaos as a good, solid buy. Paul Eden"
5,GreaterChaos,This is a great introduction into chaos magic. It has excellent information and is an easy read no pausing and thinking what the author meant. Highly recommend
5,Basic Concepts in Biology 6th Edition,I had to have this book for school. At the college it was well over $100. I paid $25. WOW!!!! Great savings. Book was in good condition as described. I am very satisfied!
4,Heaven Is Missing An Angel,"A realy good refreshing country song on this CD is ""Heaven is Missing an Angel"". Overall good CD for Classic Country George."
4,Back to Nashville,"Many country acts have moved towards a pop/country sound and away from the traditional sound of the 1950's and 60's that was heard in every bar across the country. With this recording, George Strait shows us that honky-tonk is alive and well. What is honky-tonk? It covers the heartbreak of losing a love, the trials of having to recover and the eventual realization that love can be forever. This recording follows that format, song by song. From the plaintive ""She Used to Say that to Me"" to the upbeat ""Look Who's Back in Town"" (probably the most playable single for radio) and finally the heartbreaking but hopeful sound given to ""My Infinite Love"" (also a sure-fire hit for listeners). What is honky-tonk? Follow each track as it tells a story of heartbreak and love. This is sure-fire country! It's great to hear such a strong recording from one of today's country purists."
5,It's Different!,"I tend to be quite biased when it involves George Strait and country western music because every song has a meaning behind it. This album isn't as romantic as his previous ones,but it's still great."
5,Awesome,George Strait just gets better and better!! I recomend this albumto anyone who loves traditional country music. It has a lotof his old sound but even better vocals. There are someexcellent songwriting on this album and he sings themperfect. I love every song on this album!! Honkytonkvilleshould win many awards. This is the best of his career!!!!!!
4,LIke the everready bunny...,...Georege STrait just keeps on putting out solid honky tonk traditional country music that one day will earn him the monikker of country music 'icon'. This cd ranks up there with his 'One step at a time' cd and will appeal to pop/rock fans as well as the country music faithful. Excellent stuff...get it!
4,Great grip,"These spikes were easy to install, just twist and your ready. They also improved my grip when teeing off.Great value for the $."
4,having an orgasm after respiking my golf shoes,"Spikes came I installed what I needed and wore the shoes and played a roundand they worked well, and I was happier than a pig eating coal."
4,Pulsar Softspikes Fast Twist,Arrived on time and as advertised.Work for my Footjoy golf shoes and should be fine for any similar pair.
5,BEST SPIKES AROUND.............,these are the best golf spikes around and with the great price from Amazon you can't go wrong..............
3,As good as expected,"As I have Asian hair I expected the red to have a deep red sort of effect, and it very much did. In fact, the red was so saturated that I rinsed it 20 minutes after application instead of the recommended 25, and the red is still there.A few cons that I have with it:- Smelled very toxic during application, more so than other hair dyes.- A bit too red for me, but then that was the color advertised so I shouldn't complain.- It's been two weeks and the color is fading gradually. Right now it's at a level of red that I'm quite happy with."
1,Ight,I would hope my product does good..I haven't got it yet...but I'll keep in touch whether its right or not
3,Beautiful Color... That doesn't last,"I purchased this product in order to ""go red"" after a year of being a blonde. My hair was a light/medium blonde when I applied this product and at first the color was super vibrant and AMAZING. After just one shampoo, however, (and using their color shield shampoo) it faded enourmously! I was mortified! My hair looked dull (everywhere except my roots). A few days later I purchased a red color enhancing shampoo and used that but it still faded even more. My hair looked like an orange creamsicle. I ended buying a temporary hair rinse to balance it out until I can dye my hair again (I don't want to further damage it by coloring to quickly). If the color lasted more than just 1-2 shampoos this product would receive 5 stars as I did get a lot of compliments on the color before it faded."
3,Okay hair color for and okay price,This hair color was recommended to me after I suggested that I wanted to add more red to my hair. Having dark brown hair my hair did not change very much at all. It was very disappointing. I would have taken or left it. But I certainly will not be buying this one again.
3,"Great Color, doesn't hold","My hair turned a bright, deep, vibrant red after using this and I thought it was great. Within two weeks the color was almost completely gone. The color is great, but be prepared to re-dye twice as often as you normally would with this."
2,"okay, a little weird",There must have been a lot in the book that was missing in the film. It seemed to force some themes without a deeper exploration of what is behind them. I think it is difficult to show spiritual warfare on film in a way that is truly meaningful and not corny-looking.
1,"You sent the wrong ""the list""",You sent me the list by wayne Brady and I ordered the one with Malcolm McDowell. I was disappointed but it was a cute movie just not the one I had my heart set on
3,"Ok, not great.","After reading the book, I really wanted to watch the movie. And the fact that Hilarie Burton was in it made me want to watch it even more...she's one of my favorite actresses. Obviously a movie can't contain everything from a book, and obviously, most production companies won't put all of the Spiritual Warfare stuff in movies like this, but I still think some of the stuff should have been included.SPOILER ALERTI really wish that the downfall of the list would have been included in the movie. I don't feel as if it would've taken up too much more time, but it would've shown that the list no longer had their evil power any more. I guess that's the only extra thing I think should've been included.I wanted to love this movie, but I just ended up thinking it was ok. I liked the casting for the main characters. But I didn't like some of the casting for some of the List member characters. Overall, it was just an ok movie."
1,bad bad o so bad,if you gave this 5 stars you now are on the bad list !! no gifts for you. how can you even give it 2 stars. not worth the power to run the tv !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Disappointing,"I bought this movie after reading reviews on several family-oriented sites. The acting is ""okay"" but the flow of the movie keeps getting chopped up with awkward transitions, and most disappointing, it has an overemotional yet anticlimactic end. The author probably did a better job of building up to the climax in the book, but I found that the way that the director chose to frame the sequences dealing with the ""power of prayer"" just detracted from the forward motion of the movie and gave it a pagan overtone. Its a movie I hoped to pass around in my community but one that will probably end up sitting on my shelf."
3,Okay but...,"Having read the book I was disappointed that the spiritual fullness expressed in the book did not carry over to the movie. Where there was a powerful presence of God in the book, the movie just translated ordinary hum-drum. Almost like it was edited out for some reason. Too bad it could have been a great witness. Not a bad movie just not great."
4,pretty satisfied,"Nothing really bad to report here. Good video, pretty good condition. Dvd came loose during shipping, but case was sealed fine."
1,The List should stay on the Shelf...,"There's bad movies and then there's just baaaaaad movies. The List happens to be the latter. And it definitely made my list, my list of ten worst movies ever list that is. It lacked any cohesiveness, plot or entertainment. I don't even know why anyone would produce such garbage. The only thing it accomplished was a trifecta of poor writing, acting and directing. Not to mention it was just a lame attempt at religious propaganda. Everyone involved with this movie should be embarrassed to have this to their credits or on their resumes."
2,The Reason Why She is Unfabulous,"Girl... Try to sing next time and not to scratch my ears. She has got no voice. Nowadays every actor/actress make music like they have talent for it. But I kinda liked the songs ""Say Goodbye to Jr.High"", ""Dummy"", ""I Have Arrived"" & ""I Wanna Be"". But seriously the lyrics are hilariously awful. I mean they are very NOT meaningful! Well, I'm sorry that she had braces but a person shouldn't sing 'bout their braces. I mean that is disgusting people. Please DO NOT waste your money on this silly album. If you liked just a few songs don't make the mistake I did and buy the whole album. Just buy the MP3 versions. This album made me understand why she is UNFABULOUS."
3,um?,"ok, so, I thought this album was ok.Her voice sucks on the show because she has NO idea how to control it and she has NO idea how to breathe correctly.WHY MAKE THE ALBUM?if you were trying to make a serious album, Emma, dont use songs from the show. Don't be lazy. Write new songs, or have your writers write new songs.PUNCH ROCKER?wtf is that.I loved Dummy and Mexican Wrestler. But that's about it.94 weeks (metal mouth freak)? New Shoes?POINTLESS.She's a good actress. She should stick to thaaaaaat.I hope you find this review helpful."
2,songs from the show,"The point of this cd is to put out songs from the Unfabulous show. The songs aren't from emma oberts. You shouldn't take them so seriously. They are more from her character on the show. The freaky songs are part of the character on the show: a girl in jr. high who writes a song about just about everything. On the show, you only hear a minute of the songs at most."
1,Ewwww...,"This CD is absolutely pointless. I cannot stand the TV show. Wasn't Lizzie McGuire enough?(if you want a better show of the same kind, try Clarissa explains it all, great show.)Why I cannot stand this show is because it is annoying. Addie is a spoiled rotten brat on the show and when someone makes fun of her, she has the sorriest comebacks or just doesn't stand up for herself. You know, if you like the show, whatever. I'm just stating my opinion, is all. I'm just stating it in the nicest way possible. Hey, if I don't like it, I won't buy it."
2,Tests your tolerance of the teen pop genre,"I like some teen pop. So I'm not reviewing this with a bias. But Emma's voice is very unrefined - and the lyrics, which seem to appeal to young people a few years even below Emma's age, really grate on grownups. The arrangements are cheesy in a bad way, too. If you are very young, you might enjoy this - but most others should avoid."
4,fan of unfabulous,oh my god - i love the album! i'm a huge fan of the show and now the record! for any emma fans - or any nickelodeon fans - you have to get this! xo :)
2,Hahahahaha!,"I Like the show but Addie just never sticks up for herself, and it drives me nuts. That isnt really about the CD but i""m just saying. Any way , I hate the songs they are just so pathetic."
1,Stinks!!!!!!!,"This ISN'T Joseph. I am his oldest DAUGHTER.This CD STINKS. The vocals are bad and the songs are stupid, especially ""Mexican Wrester"". Really, ""Mexican Wrester""? What garbage.STOP GIVING THESE NON-SINGING STARS RECORD DEALS!!!!Emma, stick to acting, you're good at it. Leave the music to Nick star Drake Bell."
3,Good general advice for raising girls,"This book offers good, practical advice on raising girls, and shows parents how to eliminate their stereotypes as they bring up their daughters. However, the author constantly urges parents to push math and science so that girls can get high paying jobs in traditionally male-dominated jobs. To me, this doesn't make a girl successful. It's fine if a girl's interests are in the math and science fields, but we shouldn't just expose them to these areas. Also, the author makes it sould like a woman who chooses to raise a family is from the dark ages. This life choice is not encouraged, and that's a disservice to women who want to make family the top priority in their lives."
2,Honest but obvious,"I appreciated the author's honesty and candor in describing her thought processes while raising her daughter. My problem with this book is that the conclusions of the book are obvious. The author self-admittedly spent much of her time torn between the urge to fight gender stereotyping by encouraging her girl to be as boyish as possible and the realization that urging a girl to always be boyish is pretty much the ultimate rejection of feminine worth. This subject has been sufficiently hashed out over the last decade or so, and to me the conclusions of the book seemed painfully obvious. Raising children is a difficult and disorienting task, and I appreciate the author's attempt to clarify this issue, but this is old news."
5,This should be required reading for all parents!,"I wish my mother had read this book! I consider myself pretty unbiased in issues of gender, but this book really helped me identify sexist attitudes and replace them with more positive ones. I will definitely teach my daughter to wear her ""gender glasses"" as MacKoff recommeds."
1,You're NOT buying human growth hormone!,"CAREFUL. This product is called RECOMBINANT Human Growth Hormone, which means is can be anything. It is probably harmless, but extremely effective for those who want to THINK that it does something to them. It probably has NO EFFECT on ANYTHING in your body. I tried it for 3 months, and experienced aboslutely nothing except a bad taste in my mouth.Only a little reasearch showed me that this is NOT a hormone. You CAN get real Human Growth Hormone, but it is avaliable only by prescription; it can be taken only by injection; it would cost you a minimum of $2,500 a month; and if you STOP TAKING IT, you'll get sick. (By the way, the REAL stuff apparently WORKS!! But this isn't it.)MOVE ON!!"
1,A crummy book,"I agreed to teach Systems Analysis and accepted this text as it was the one already selected when I arrived on campus. Later I was told by the person who selected this text, ""Your problem is that you believe what you read. I choose books to teach against."" In other words, the person who originally selected this book thought that it was full of bunk and planned to use it as a foil for his wit and wisdom. Personally, I see no reason to force students to buy a book that you disagree with. Unfortunately, his assessment that the book is full of bunk is largely correct. If the book was mearly full of drivel it would be a better book than it is. Alas, it also overly long and confuses students. I would not recommend using this book. I will certainly never use it again."
4,good,"Love Steve Mcqueen, This was a good movie. My husband really likes westerns and this was really good. Good job"
3,great film...horrible playback via Amazon Prime.,"Okay I know this isn't the forum to slam Amazon Prime, but as Amazon constantly prompts you for reviews I can't help but underline in this instance or any other occasion in which a film is viewed via Prime that the film viewing experince will suffer immensely.So yes, Nevada Smith is a fine western with a wonderful cast under the direction of a gifted director...particularly when it comes to westerns. But watching the film through Amazon is a total drag.For further clarification we stream Prime using a PS3 with outstanding bandwidth and internet speed...but to no avail using Prime.Amazon has attempted to address the problem it seems, so that films will stop buffering every 10 seconds but now the quality of the ""HD"" setting resembles an old VHS tape.Again, film good, Amazon bad."
4,A VERY interesting tennis game.,"Virtual Open Tennis is a VERY reasonable tennis game with not that many weak spots. It gives a reasonable amount of options, from Tournament mode to a special Training mode to hone your tennis skills. There really aren't any weak spots, although the speed is a little bit faster than a normal tennis game. The graphics are very good for a 32-bit system and I was very pleased at what came out. Two different tournaments ranging from beginner to expert. The training mode is also a very worthy feature. Ranging in different modes from serve to ""The Can Game"" where your player serves and tries to hit the cans sitting in the service box. When you hit one or more cans, you'll be given points. The computer gives to different options to select before you start. Would make a great gift and is definitely worth buying!"
5,Beautiful book,"This book is beautifully illustrated, and fun for the story book collector, gnome fan or child.It was sweet and charming without being sugary and contrived.I purchased it because I am an artist and wanted to have a closer look at prints of the illustrator's work, as I am a fan. This book did not disappoint."
5,Gnomes,". I live in PA and bought it because a lifelong friend in CA wrote me about seeing it and being absolutely delighted because it took her back to her childhood. (We are both in our 80's) I gave it to my local library after seeing what charmed her so much. Gorgeous pictures, absorbing content. Children should be enchanted."
5,Gnomes:Color and story album,"Book was in great condition, price was right and the story/artwork is simply one of the most imaginative, well planned ideas I've seen in a long time!"
5,"Spawned the series ""The World of David the Gnome""","I'm old enough to remember the Nick Jr series ""David the Gnome"" from the 1990s. I also remember ""Finders Keepers,"" ""Maya the Bee,"" and why oh why haven't ""Count Duckula"" or ""Danger Mouse"" attained syndication on Nicktoons?David the Gnome was directly inspired by this wonderful book, which delves into the art, culture, traditions, woodworking, naturalism, and lore of the gnomes. Also their lifelong enmity with trolls. In the series the trolls tended to be bumbling and rather stupid, but encyclopedias of magical creatures all support that description, as does Harry Potter. Not so the Orcs from Tolkien, who get the name of Goblins.There was no more frightening picture to me as a child than the illustration of the disgusting Snotgurgle. I usually skipped right over that to the description of the gnomes' diet."
4,I was tickled to get this book.,"I have wanted this book since I was a kid. When I saw it on here used, I said ""sure why not"". The book was so reasonably priced, I could not resist. It was about $5.99 or so delivered. The book was used so it was not in the best shape, but it was loved and readable and clean. I would definitely recommend buying books this way. Oh, the book! I found the story delightful and will treasure it forever."
5,Magnificent concept,"Everyone of my generation, as far as I know, was brought up with stories of fairies and gods/goddesses and childlike wonder about imaginative places/worlds. In this book, the illustrator brings alive the world of gnomes, those invisible caretakers of the plants and animals on our planet. Presented like a documentary, the author and illustrator provide us with ""everything you always wanted to know about gnome life"", from what they eat to what their houses look like, what they do, and how they dress. The book makes it clear that, while gnomes are very real, they don't show themselves to just anyone. And they really want us humans to take good care of the plants and animals in our care. I love this book, and I love its sequel."
4,Excellent resource item,Excellent resource items for collectors who have just started or are ole hats at it.
3,Fun book,"This book is a fun coffee table book for any lover of gnomes. I was a little disappointed because the cover on my book had a tear, however, I was in a hurry to ship it off to a friend so I didn't have time to return the book."
4,Freedom's Daughters,Loved this book. If you want to know about the struggle for women's rights and black american's and the trials they endured. this is the book to read.
4,Eye-Opening,"This is a must for anyone interested in the Civil Rights struggle, then and now. I read this book thinking I knew a lot about the main players involved in the late 50's and early 60's and was very surprised at the extent of the involvement of women. Without taking away from the triumphs of King, Abernathy, Bond, Lewis and the many others who fought in the struggle, this is a must read for anyone who wants to know the whole story. I recommend it highly."
3,Nice feel but too much flowery scent,"I don't know why but I assumed that the title description for this product ""White Tea & Vitamins"" meant that the tea leaf itself was used in the soap, not the flower blossom the tea plant produces, which really stinks up this soap. The overall effacy of the soap is really nice, leaving your skin very clean, soft and well hydrated, the product lathering up well but rinsing away easily and completely, however the smell is so strong it almost knocked me out. I don't care for flowery scents at all and this soap is loud and too perfumey to suit me. My allergies kicked in before I even got out of the shower and my eyes were weeping and itching and my nose runny. I love almost clear glycerine soaps, especially those made with some natural ingredients, but would not purchase this soap again and will give away the other two bars in the package."
1,You get what you pay for...,"In less than 2 weeks this wind spinner has lost its spin. The assembly that holds the petals isn't turning properly -- it is ""catching"" on something. The middle of the flower is completely stuck. I know I put it together properly, the directions are simple and it did ""spin"" at first. So in the trash it goes and I've ordered a more expensive spinner. Lesson learned."
3,Very difficult reading,"""Brothers and strangers"" is a scholarly book about the often tricky relations between African-Americans and Liberia, a West African republic founded by freed Black American slaves.The subject is interesting, but unfortunately this book is too detailed and super-scholarly, attempts to deal with a dozen different subjects all at once, and often looses the red thread.If you want to write a dissertation on Marcus Garvey's or W.E.B. Du Bois' contacts with Liberia, you probably would have to sift through brother Sundiata's magnum opus. Personally, I consider this to be one of the most difficult scholarly books I've ever attempted to read. And I have an MA, for crying out loud!Hopefully, more accessible books on Liberia and Liberia's impact on Black America exist. Still, I give the book three stars, since I'm in general agreement with much of the contents."
4,Silver Blitz OK but maybe not as good as in past.,My wife has wanted a silver polishing cloth like one she had in the past.We found this one on Amazon but did not buy because the shipping cost wouldbe more than the cost of the cloth. Later with a big order Amazon postedthe cloth with our order. I thought it would be combined with our big orderso I jumped at the opportunity. I did not realize that the orders would besplit until the last screen. Since We had not found the cloth in stores Ilet it go through. I still feel that the cloth could have been shipped insmaller packaging at less cost. My wife says it is not as good as the oneshe had before.
2,More elbow grease than intrinsic polishing agent.,It did shine up my silver but I've used better agents. Took a lot of work. Not suitable for someone with arthitic hands.
2,bad egg,"I have this exact cd alarm clock for my son, he loves it & listens to his oceans sounds at night. So when I was in the market for another, there was no question that this is what I wanted. I purchased it, the one I receive was broken so I exchanged it. I received a new one promptly. This lasted about 2 months then the CD player broke. I'm very disappointed since he quality is great. My originaly is over 3 years old & works like a charm playing lullabys every night. I guess it was a bad egg?"
3,Good but not great,I felt that Rick's Provence and the French Riviera guide has some of the essentials but not the inspired coverage of his other books. There isn't the excitement that he presents in his Italian and other European guides. The coverage of the hill towns of Provence is somewhat perfunctory.
3,Fine for planning your itinerary I suppose,"As far as information goes, this book deserves 5 stars ... it's great for figuring out how to get around, what to see (and what not to see!), and how much money to bring. However, I couldn't give 5 stars, simply because I was hoping for better maps and maybe a few color photographs. The book has crudely drawn maps -- almost with a cartoonish look about them -- that don't seem all that helpful. And as for photos, well, the one on the cover is about it. This is a great book to have when planning your trip to Provence ... however, I would advise supporting it with a 2nd guidebook that touts glossy pages with color pictures and maps!"
4,Good planning book,"I have a wonderful time using this book to plan my visit, although I would still recomend getting a few more reference document such as local map to accomondate this book."
2,Too Late,"I ordered 4 books within two days. All showed a shipping date and time roughly the same. This book showed up a week after we left for France, while the others showed up in plenty of time for review and discussion. Never opened the package but returned it for credit"
4,Rick Steve's Provence and the Riviera,Great resource book. Tons of information that is well researched.
5,Wonderful,I purchased this along with orange flower water for my Christmas baking and it was the greatest. Would recomend it to anyone who bakes and is looking for a different flavor.
3,"Good, but the PLAYSTATION does this better.","This is a good football game, but it is not near as fun to play as its excellent PLAYSTATION counterpart. Graphics are poor, but hte gameplay is still quite fun. Only buy this if you own no other system, as the gameplay was more polished on the GENESIS or SEGA CD."
2,Islamic weapons,"The book arrive quickly however whilst the book was supposed to be new and it appeared to be new, many of the bottoms of the pages had 2 cm tears and some pages were faulty from the manufacture and were elongated by 3 cm and folded into the book at the corners. Overall I was dissapointed in the quality of the state of repair of this alleged new book."
4,Exelent,"I really use them and i encourage other people to try it, remember that you always can return it back if you did not like the product.. thank you!!"
5,An excellent book for quick solutions,"This is not a book for new people programing Visual Basic 6 and SQL Server, but if you have an idea of how to work with that tools I think that will be what you're looking for.Most of my question about make connections with a relational database were solved in those papers. It's a book that gives you the right answers and solutions for the typicals problems and the author train your thought to take the best way in the develop of your solution.I don't know who is Mr. William R. Vaughn, but if I would have the oportunity I would have to express my thanks to share your knowledge."
2,I did not have fun with this title.,"This title is not very much fun. The graphics are poor, and the play control is sloppy. No matter how bad you want a new soccer game for the dying Sega Saturn, this is not what you want."
3,her kind of trouble,The book was just what I needed to complete a set. I must admit I found this very expensive but it was my fault for thinking the postage was free. In all it was probably dearer than the original price of the book. In future check better!!!
2,Cute...but painful,"I bought these shoes because they looked incredibly cute, and wedges tend to be more comfortable for walking than stilettos. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The ankle strap on these pinched my heel so badly that it bled! Ouch! I don't know if it's because I have bony ankles and the straps rubbed the wrong way, or if the strap will do that to everyone, but I definitely know they are too painful to wear if I plan to do much (if any) walking. This shoe would be 10 times more comfortable if it had any support in the footbed or padding on the straps."
2,Could have been fantastic,This unit could have been fantastic if not for one issue. Almost all the navigation fuctions cannot be used while the vehicle is moving over 10 miles an hour. What good is having all this power and information at your fingertips and not be able to use it when you need it. If you are going down the highway and you want the unit to find a restaurant or an address you have to pull over and stop to enter it into the unit. This is just plan wrong and there are many other units on the market that will let you imput information without stoping the car. I can understand not allowing DVD's to be viewed while driving but restricting the ability to imput address into the unit while in motion is just plain stupid. I highly recommend you do not buy this unit as you will be very disappointed.
2,XM Radio INterface is unusable,"The AVIC-N2 is an excellent radio and GPS tracking system, but the price that they charge for the XM interface you would at least expect to get the functionality of a standalone $49 XM radio. There is no channel guide, no channel description, no channel groupings. If you do not already know he channel numbers the unit is unusable. They have since come out with the N3 which fixes the issue but they have no plans to help the thoudands of people that paid lots of money for the N2."
1,Giant Waste Of Money!,"Save your money. I invested over 2K to purchase and have this unit installed. After about a year the screen would go blank, but the lights on the face plate would flash. It would come back on after a minute or 2, but I would usually have to take the disc out or do something else. I figured Id call Pioneer and see what theyd say. They told me Id have to ship the unit to Ohio, problem is its an in dash system that cost me $500 to install! Not to mention they said it will cost $200 to fix unless they find its their fault. I would stay away from their stereo products. Way overpriced, and unreliable."
4,Scooby lunch tote,My son loves it. It is great for younger kids. Small size for older kids. Plastic zipper has never worked but for my 7 year old it has been fine because its Scooby. It is plastic on front but material on sides and back. Inside is plastic so you can wash it out.
4,Operation Logic Bomb,"the game is good but the controling is a bit diffcult, however the game is great to have in a collection."
1,Don't buy this book.,"This is a terrible handbook of the birds in Egypt - doesn't even merit 1/2 star. Only 14 black and white sketches of birds, no color. It might be of interest if you are a historian ( written in 1923 ) but if you are a birder, like me, it is mostly useless. I suggest Amazon drop this book from their sales list."
5,LMT,An excellent resource book for development and function of the nervous system. Written in an easy to understand language with great illustrations to accompany otherwise complex functions within the human body.
1,Mostly an advertisement; poorly written.,"Mostly an advertisement for the author's CrainioSacral therapy, this book is poorly written and full of crude hand-drawn figures."
2,Pretty damned dry,"This book would have been a whole lot better by providing much more in the way of examples of the way businesses cheat and how they are caught (or not) by savvy auditors.It's a college text, so it is probably already out of date."
3,Extensive,This book is extensive but confusing. I had to flip back to different chapters to make sure I didn't miss anything.
4,It's OK.,"I'm a college student. I am studying auditing to take an AICPA exam. well, auditing is hard for me to study. I think, in order to understand a structure of auditing, reading a book is important. 'Modern Auditing' is helpful to me. A consistent arrangement of context, detailed indexes, lots of figures.... I'd like to recommend 'Modern Auditing'."
1,"Vague, wordy, confusing, and in need of examples","I found that if you want to learn the language of auditing, have another reference handy. Often, the discourse goes on and on and on and could really be distilled down into a sentence or two that had a firm and grounded presentation. There were very few examples so it was difficult at best to try to understand the often high-level conceptual frameworks that were constantly being presented. I also noted quite a few editing errors that probably arose from cut-and-pastes that were not carefully reviewed. Also, figures and diagrams were reused and were not carefully reviewed either as information was present that didn't apply to the new scenario."
1,Very Confusing,"I believe you can find a better auditing textbook in the market. I took an auditing class with one of the authur in Portland and, as a result, was required to buy the textbook. But, I ended up using another auditing textbook in order to get an ""A"" from this class. The format and writing style are very difficult to follow and understand."
1,Wrong Product,"Amazon.com is one of the best company to do business with, but some of the underscores working for Amazon.com are horrible. When one orders a product, they ship another. As a matter of fact, I order Modern Auditing: Assurance services and the integrity of financial reporting (8th ed.) by Boynton and Johnson, and I receive Study Guide Modern auditing (7th ed.) by Boynton and Johnson Kell. I have made a request to fix that error; so far, no one replies to me yet.Again, several months ago I ordered 2 Intermediate Accounting (12th. ed.) by Donald E. Kieso, Jerry J. Weygandt and Terry D. Warfield, and I received one. Still, I replied that information to the dealership no answer. I hoped this e-mail would answer those underscores exertion for Amazon.com and help me to recover my money."
5,A Classic Movie!!,"I totally agree with Wally, this is a great film, fortunately; I did get this on tape recently in the 2 hour speed and the copy is pristine. It is a welcome addition to my collection until someone at the studio ""pulls their head out"" and puts this on DVD."
5,good material,this instructional book is easily understood. A great help for beginning violinist young or adult. Would reccommend this purchase for the violinist library.
4,I liked it,I like cyndi lauper. Who doesn't? I'm happy with this CD. Especially when she sings with sarah mclachlan.
4,the music is wonderful - classic cyndi,my only problem is i got stuck with the duel disc version which i've already learned won't load into itunes for whatever reason. i enjoy listening to my cds through itunes on my computer and this new disc format prevents that. it would be nice if amazon offered this to those who want it and the regular cd to those why don't.
1,BUYER BEWARE: CD Doesn't Play!,"I looked forward to receiving this item, but was sorely disappointed.It's a dual disc (one side CD + one side DVD). There's a *teeny, tiny little sticker* on the outside of the case that reads, ""The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore will not play on some CD and DVD players.""What??!Cindi Lauper is awesome, and I have no doubt that this disc contains fabulous renditions of her music. Who on earth releases a CD that doesn't conform to specs? In spite of the implied promise that the disc might play on SOME players, it wouldn't play on any of mine -- tabletop CD player, portable CD player, car CD player, PC player, Mac player.I didn't bother trying the DVD. Plus, the jewel case fell apart the first time I opened it. Save yourself the trouble. FAIL."
2,"Eh, pretty boring","9 times out of 10, I prefer the acoustic versions of most music, which is why I bought this cd. Ms. Lauper makes fun, upbeat '80s music, but after purchasing this cd, I realized her songs are best enjoyed in their original form. ""True Colors"" and ""Time After Time"" are nice, and the reggae-inspired rendition of ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" is entertaining, but overall, this cd is a snoozefest."
4,Still having fun,"Okay, she looks phenomenal on the cover, but I saw her in concert last year, and the years are creeping up on her. But this woman can ROCK like few men can! She is an incredible performer and entertainer, and has kept her unique voice through the years.You gotta love this girl. And this album is great!"
1,NO MORE OLD SONGS!!,"One star, for the new songs this cd contains. but honestly, stop releasing the same songs over and over and over again."
2,Not a good fishing game,"The only good part about it is the control. The graphics are nothing to brag about, the sound is average, and the fun factor is the worst part of it. Catching the fish is too easy in some parts and the levels lack original ideas. I got bored of this game after getting halfway through the second level.If you want a good fishing game for the Super Nintendo, get Bassin's Black Bass by T-HQ. The game features Hank Parker and it has everything that Super Black Bass lacks."
1,why i got this ??,"I was buying a ipod dock speaker thing , and this was on my order WTF ? lol oh well"
3,Crow!,"A pretty good outing by Laura Lippman. The book advances the life and times of Tess Monaghan within a decent mystery. Not the best in the series, but certainly not the worst. I always liked Crow and his relationship with Tess."
3,Not one of the best,"I enjoyed this book, but not as much as the earlier ones. If you like the series, this one is worth reading."
2,caution !!!,"The makers of Aquafina bottled spring water were recently cited in the news for something not too great about their source. Guess what? It's TAP WATER.Yes, when Aquafina says they filter it, I believe that their statement is true. Yes, it's kosher and the bottles ARE easy to carry. Yes, the water tastes OK.However, if the source is indeed tap water, why bother with this? It may be filtered; but you can get water that's TRULY from a spring when you choose other brands.I would encourage you to buy other brands of bottled water. I have serious doubts that this comes from any ""spring."""
3,Quenches your thirst!,"Yes, dihydrogen oxide is the miracle tonic! It cures dehydration, can be used to wash your hands, and put out small fires! For the paltry sum of $1.29 plus $12.61 shipping, you can have a plastic bottle of tap water that was chlorinated at the Aquafina plant rather than your own local municipal water source!Suckers, kiss your money good-bye!"
4,"Close, but not quite definitive collection","I have been looking for years for a definitive Survivor Greatest Hits package. This is the closest yet. However, this CD still is missing the following Billboard Hot 100 chart entries: ""The One That Really Matters"", ""The Moment of Truth"", and ""How Much Love"". This collection does however include ALL of the band's Top 40 hits. So, if you are just looking for the Top 40 hits, this is for you. If you are looking for all of their songs to make the Hot 100, then I would suggest buying this and trying to download the other 3 songs. The CD also includes great liner notes."
2,SAME OLD STUFF,"This album although remastered is essentially what we've all heard before. Slightly better sound quality yes but does it justify another compilation? I don't think so. All Survivor fans will probably not only have their albums but 1 or 2 of the compilations anyway.To keep matters right ""Rebel Girl"" track is available on Japanese import ""Survivor"" so you can obtain it. It's available on Ebay too every few weeks usually. The reviewer from Oklahoma (RAY) states it's unavailable which is not correct. I bought it only a few months ago brand new on import.It's time Survivor release new material or call it a day leaving their musical legacy for the excellence it was/is.I for one am tired at being ripped off by the record company with these compilations. Sorry but a full price cd for one track I don't have to me isn't worth it. Still if I see it in a bargain bin I might be tempted......."
4,On my Xmas List,"I was reminded of this group while watching ""Mall Cop"" today. I saw this group at our little county fair in 2010 and I was 4 feet away from the stage and THEY SOUND THE SAME. I yelled ""THANK YOU"" inbetween choruses because this is a labor of love for them - they can't be making much playing county fairs. They sounded sooo good. I don't know why they haven't stayed as popular over the years as, say ""Journey"" which is a simular sound but I am glad I got to see them. I'll be getting this for Xmas. I gave it 4 stars because someone said it has low sound in places."
3,How many compilations they need?,"Join us at the campaign ONASCAPHOIGKMABRB (Oh No, Another Survivor Compilation Again, Please, Hold On, I'm Gonna Kill Myself And Be Right Back), and save us from this mess! I'm a huge Survivor fan, and I have every album from the band, but with Fire In Your Eyes, I don't feel they need another one, not counting the other million ones, through the years! Where's the new material they promissed to us, this year? I'm still waiting. C'mon, people, I hope you understand my point of view. Please, Mr. Jamison, the Van Halen soup-opera was enough, don't start another one! Get your feets on the studio, record new songs and hit the road, instead of keep releasing only compilations."
3,How To Make Great Songs Sound Crappy!,"This compilation has all of the great songs that a casual fan would expect to find. The only songs that hit the Top 100 that were omitted are The One That Really Matters, The Moment of Truth, and How Much Love (and none of these hit the Top 40 anyway).While the song selection is good, the sound quality is not. Most songs sound weak and tinny; even possibly mastered at the wrong speed.If the sound quality were better this would be a 4 star review, but I had to subtract at least one for the sound..."
5,"Survivor""The Best"" In the Top 10 best rock and roll bands of all time","its amazing how much of a great and wonderful band these guys are , dow i have all their albums except the first and last {yeah coicidentally}every song they put out is perfect rock and roll and this one is a perfect hit album and much more.Even dowI think their best song is between ""Ever Since The World...."" and ""Santa Ana Winds"" this is still a great compilation of one of the best rock and roll bands of all time well they're definitley in my top 10. And going back actually im most certain that ""Santa Ana Winds"" was without a doubt their best song.With such an incredible piano masterpiece at the beginning its just a beautiful song overall, i really cant get enough of it. But yeahh this Definite Album is a must for any music fan.I would also advice you to get all their albums which i think r all classiks, That signature sound they have is ahhh..... so mindblowing!!!!!!"
3,For Ben Richardson...,"This is for Ben, the guy with the Yoda quote: George Lucas has stated in countless interviews that his main influence when writing STAR WARS was Tolkien and ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and even went so far as to say that STAR WARS was pretty much the Lord of the Rings in space. Surely you can see the parallels in the stories?"
1,Tolkien would be rolling over in his grave!,This game is a real stinker. Your party members wander off constantly and moments later you'll hear them grunting as they're be slaughtered by an troll. After playing 10 minutes of this game you just want orcs to kill you and you're whole party. This game was a big letdown.
1,Unplayable,"I had high hopes for this game seeing so many positive review, but I was severely disappointed. I enjoy a challenging game, but this is impossible. Probably the worst part is the controls. There is a full second delay from when you hit the attack button to when he lunges with his sword, plus you can't attack and move at the same time. The companions are incredibly aggravating and literally walk away from you and die. Plus the overworld is sprawling, and Frodo moves extremely slowly. I love Lord of the Rings and old games like Zelda, but avoid this one. The graphics are nice enough but don't make up for the terrible game play."
3,It had everything to be...,"...one of the best SNES games. This game made me buy the books, so I'm paying my respect to Interplay for introducing me to Tolkien's world. As someone said below, this game has amazing graphics and some of the most beautiful songs (the opening theme is just splendid). But, besides all the problems cited by the other reviewers, one particular made me almost quit playing: What is Legolas for? The instructions manual states that he is kinda valuable in the game but he doesn't shoot any single arrow in it! Moreover, I didn't know that Gandalf should die in order to beat the game, so I spent almost one hour trying to kill the Balrog. A Volume 2 would be quite welcome if Interplay didn't screw up."
2,Not what I hoped,Bought this to get orientation of the vestibular organ and was disappointed to find the canals and cochlea are not shaped correctly. Wanted a study aide for vestibular rehab and this didn't do it. Had to actually make my own model as I can't find one anywhere online.
4,"A Good Look at ""Murder in America""","Holmes and Holmes (1994) do a great job of outlining a truly complex phenomenon, homicide. While homicide is not a subject matter we enjoy scrutinizing, it is a subject matter we enjoy as entertainment. However, once homicide is understood at any level, it can then be appreciated as the ugly crime that it is. Holmes and Holmes outline the different degrees and types of homicide in such a manner that is logical and understandable. They then break down the phenomenon by types and report specific characteristics and statistics regarding that particular area. The only flaw that I encountered was the out-of-date statistics. Although, it must be said that this has nothing to do with the authors themselves, but rather the fact that the book was published some six years ago. Overall, Holmes and Holmes do a good job of putting homicide into perspective."
3,Pointless Action,"If you want to simply bash enemies, this is the game for you. Players move around a set path(slightly 3-D) and kill any enemy that appears. That sums it up."
3,A gift,"I never read this as it was a gift to my son. He said he liked it and recommended I read kiss my judas, which he also liked."
4,"dark, mesmerizing, genuinely creepy","Amid the slick writing, the grimly fascinating characters, plots, and setpieces, it's easy to miss the literary intelligence that's at work here. Baer gives us not only an addictive mystery-thriller, which is genuinely creepy and disturbing, but also a submerged meditation on the slipperiness of identity. There's even some well-placed commentary on _Ulysses_ here. Baer's vision ain't pretty, but it's compelling, and I think he's one to watch."
2,Disappointed,"The volume of sound produced by this ensemble in forte passages, such as the start of the fifth symphony, is in sufficient."
3,Necroscope the 13th,"With the 13th novel in the Necroscope series, Brian Lumley brings it all to a close. Now, I must say that I have enjoyed the entire series, but these last bits with Jake Cutter as the Necroscope do seem a bit forced. This book is a far cry from the classic that is the first Necroscope, or my personal favs, the Vamipire World trilogy (Blood Brothers, Last Aerie, Bloodwars). It does tie up several loose ends left from the Lost Years. Brian Lumley has said that this would be the last in the series and he is being true to his word. I give this three stars, because I was drawn in until the very end. His human characters continue to be ""real"" while his vampires continue to go beyond anything Stoker or Rice could dream up."
4,Wouldn't missssss it.,"Ardent Brian Lumley fans would not agree that any of his Necroscope books were getting ""stale."" Most of us were pacing as we waited for the next book full of new twists and turn and new creatures of dread. While I never found Jake to be as ""intriguing"" as Harry, his appearance in book 13 fleshed him out a bit more. Trask and the others become even more complex as the danger builds. Unexpected twists occur with familiar places, situations and names making themselves know once again.The only drawback to me is that this is the last of the series!"
4,Nice wrap-up. Lame final chapter.,"Wrapped up the series, answered the questions posed it the previous two books. Personally, I liked the book, but thought the ending - the final dozen pages - were pretty shoddy. It seemed that he ran out of ideas so wrapped it up with some mental time travel so we see how the future turns out."
2,Unimpressed,"After enjoying all of the previous Necroscope books, I was very disappointed with Brian Lumley's concluding book. Most of the Necroscope books are vivid, exciting and well-written, but this final book is slow, drawn out and ends unsatisfyingly. It starts out well enough, with an exciting episode upon a cruise liner, but the book soon loses steam. There are many scenes and lengthy dialogues that have little relevance to the narrative or plot. Brian Lumley appears to have written the extremely unsatisfying ending of the series hastily, which made me question why I had bothered to read the Necroscope series at all. I won't recommend this to anyone. After spending so much effort in writing this series (about 15 years!), I am amazed that Brian Lumley ended the series so lamely."
2,Bloodless,"As with any series that spans over a dozen installments, Lumley's Necroscope chronicles have had their ups and downs but unfortunately he has chosen to end the series with one of his weakest efforts yet. After setting up a great opening sequence in a luxury cruise ship, the energy immediately leeches from the novel and nothing happens for virtually the next 200 pages. Our heroes are mesmerized into utter stupidity as they approach the final confrontation which is anti-climactic at best. The only real satisfaction I got from the novel was the futuristic epilogue which at least brought us a little closure while firmly nailing shut both the coffin and any possibility of a sequel. Having loved this series since its inception, it's disheartening to hand in a review as tepid as this one but I am a longtime admirer of Lumley's talents and have high hopes that his next offering will spawn an engrossing new tale."
4,Motigraphics,"Dr. Maddock's book offers insights into human motivation that are easily understood and more importantly, easily adapted - especially in the marketing arena. Complex issues that have perplexed me for 26 years as a marketing professional have now become significantly simpler as a result of reading this book. The basic premise that spiritual survival is actually more motivating than physical survival helps explain behavior that has historically become jumbled into tired traditional research jargon that is unusable beyond a single study. This book is now on the shelves of every client we handle. And every prospect as well. If you are in marketing, you will either read and use this book to understand your customers, or pray your customers don't."
3,Hoping for more durability feel,"The clip is definitely durable, but the plastic sleeve is less than desirable.I used some magazine article pages and I have used regular paper.Sometimes the paper inserts slip as you clip and sometimes the sleeve itself is ""uneven"" once clipped.Uneven, meaning the packet is ""rippled"". I do not know how else to describe it.Some adjustment may be needed.Passable, but no perfect. I can't give it too bad a rating, since you do get what you pay for."
2,POOR QUALITY ruins otherwise historical performance,"...Watched 3-4 songs. The video is mediocre. The audio (DTS believe it or not) is bland and flat. The vocals are extremely hot in the mix, and the instruments are nowhere to be found. No bottom end. Poor dynamics...Once again, don't trust every review here. Some people get too attached to a particular musician or group and overlook the poor presentation of the DVD. As much as I like the music, I can't overlook the lackluster and half-baked audio and video.SKIP THIS ONE..."
4,Queen Live At Wimbleton,Loved it. My purchase came within days and was packaged very well. Very happywith my selection.
2,Lack some of the best exits,"Good history on Wembley Stadium. However, it lacks some of the greatests hits. I also would've like to see some of the other aspects of the concert, such as the other musicians every now and then."
5,Great Concert DVD,"Let me start off by saying I am not a die hard Queen fan. I picked up this dvd after I got the Live Aid dvd. I had almost forgotten how good they were at Live Aid. Definetely one of the main highlights from that dvd. This dvd was great. Great songs, band sounds great, and that great massive crowd at Wembly. The 5.1 dts sounded great even though I could not crank it up all the way.(I hate my neighbor lol.) Buy it and enjoy it."
5,FANTASTIC!,"This is 75% of the whole concert (FROM THE LP'S/CD'S),but it is GREAT!The show has some big hits that show how powerful this band really was,from the early 1970's right up to the ""A Kind Of Magic"" album in 1986.THIS WAS PART OF THE 'MAGIC TOUR',and it lived up to that.Even without the other parts that were cut out of the VIDEO (mostly 'NON-QUEEN' songs) this has alot of good fun in the 75 minutes,Freddie's great ""voice test with fans"" is here and some great comments about the so-called ""BREAK-UP OF QUEEN"".A very good tape,and a very great sample of the legend that was QUEEN. END"
4,Freddie at his BEST,"My brother is a HUGE Queen fan, I thought they were underrated in America too. I bought him this and he loved it and played it almost everyday for what seemed like forever, this is the only Queen live CD or DVD you ever need of them live. They play all there hits and the crowd eats them alive. Freddie cements his legacy thru this performance. One thing I liked about this is he doesn't wear some flaming outfit like he did back in earlier concerts. The spandex and nonsense. I think it takes away from how gifted the guy was because people will jsut focus on that and his lifestyle. None of the songs stray from the album unlike bands like Metallica have done, but the songs live sound better than the original album versions. One key moment is the banter between Freddie and the audience. He truly was a master at stagecraft and this clip has been replayed almost everytime they bring him up in media. His vocal dives followed by the crowds meager attempts...classic Freddie."
5,Next Best Thing To Being There,I loved watching this DVD. The only drawback is the song list doesn't include the theme for Flash Gordon. Otherwise it's a good sampler of Queen's greatest stuff.
5,BOOM!!,"This is an amazing concert. I was blown away. Freddie's voice was all around fantastic. He was a great performer, and it shows in this DVD. The special features are also very good. This is a must have for anyone who loves QUEEN."
5,Killer Queen DVD!,Great DVD! Great price! Nothing like Freddy Mercury and Queen doing what they do best - entertaining a live audience and getting the entire crowd involved!!
2,I returned it,"I see I am in the minority but I didn't like this DVD and returned it. I guess if you are a die-hard Queen fan then you'll like it but I just didn't find it much chop at all. I was suprised, I expected to love it."
3,A Good DVD For A Mediocre Queen Fan!,I don't LOVE Queen but I'm glad I bought that DVD. It brings back some good memories.
3,Apparently Remastered...,"It was good to see this great concert again but must admit to a slight disappointment at the remastering. I would not have noticed any difference whatever with the quality of picture, and considering I played it on my Sony blu -ray player using HDMI cable I was expecting a lot more. I am no tech whiz but was thinking it would have been good to remove a lot of the flair ups and bleeding of image that happens due to Freddy's franting running around the stage. Still, to get the complete concert on cd as well makes this a good way to purchase this concert film.The dvd extras are nothing new either: the rehearsal footage I have already seen attached to the Queen On Fire dvd...go figure!"
5,This is the one...,Freddy and crew are at their very best in this DVD. They had matured as stage performers at this point and Mercury is mesmerizing. If you want to see what QUEEN is all about this is the best DVD to buy -- of the few available. I was out of the country when QUEEN was in its heyday. I only knew their music. I was a fan of the music but had no idea what they looked like. I was thinking they dressed up like KISS or something? It was both surprising and fun to watch Mercury's polished stage antics for the first time in this DVD. Great music. Great performance.
4,old queen,"This was odd to me at first however I brought it along to a party of a bunch of us 40 somethings and it was a big hit. I have never seen Queen in concert before, just love their music. It was cool, sad though, knowing Freddie's story."
3,"Good, not great","However I LOVE Queen this dvd is too much for a fan....I would have prefered less hours but more quality on the sound. If you play it on a regular DVD you will hear it fine, but if you use a Home Theather you will hear the lack of quality in the sound.Anyway.... at the end is Queen....!"
4,Very Good,"This has most of their classic songs and you can skip the songs you do not like. Overall, very good. My kids like ""We will rock you""."
5,Not received yet !!!,"What review should I have if I didn't receive this DVD yet !!!!Unbelievable !!!I order it in November and I'm still waiting for it, but I paid for it !How can I trust you anymore ???"
2,Disappointed,"The camera needed to be a bit further back. As much as I enjoy close ups, and I mean close ups, I like seeing a concert not looking up nostrals or in ear canals, constant camera angles made it difficult to enjoy."
2,Not the best...,"Queen were perhaps the greatest live band in history, but Freddie Mercury was not up to his past greatness for this show. His voice is much weaker than in his glory days.To see him live at his peak, check out On Fire at the Bowl, or We Will Rock You. And obviously the Live Aid DVD has a legendary Queen performance.The Live At Wembley show is well-produced, but this performance is Freddie's weakest on DVD."
5,Queen - Live at Wembley Stadium,How can you go wrong with a Queen DVD? For those of us unfortunate enough to never have seen a live Queen performance this DVD makes us feel as though we were there.
5,FREDDIE--BLESS YOU AND QUEEN! AMAZING,"This is a MIND blowing concert from the 1986 ""Magic"" tour by Queen. Amazing production values and superb musicianship--Freddie Mercury and the band blew the socks off this crowd and it just had my husband and I shaking our heads in sadness--Freddie Mercury was THE quinessential frontman. How sad that he's now gone. A unique band with a unique frontman. Enjoy!"
2,outdated,"I purchased this video to show my class on diseases and history. The video is so out of date I didn't even finish watching it myself, let alone show it to my class. If I know more than the video does, it doesn't help me."
5,Popsie Photos of the Ronettes,"The photographer was THE photographer photogrpahing Rock and Roll stars in that era. He had the access, the contacts, and the skill to generate collectible quality photos. I purchased several prints. They were beautiful black and white renditions of the Ronettes. The photos were made at the Colpix sound studio...the girls were just starting out...so excited. Look at the SAMPLE photo. Nedra, on the left had just turned 16 the month prior. Ronnie, in back, was 17...Estelle, her older sister was 18. I have thousands of dollars of Ronettes' records and collectibles. And these photos are among my most prized. Worth every penny."
2,Problems with the Bosch Combo Kit,"I've had this kit for about a year. The jigsaw recently quit on me (after minor use), I could smell something in the motor burning. The power drill hand-tightened chuck seems loose and does not grip the bits well. The saw bits do not lock into the reciprocating saw well (they were third party bits though). And the circular saw is underpowered. The bag doesn't seem to be made for the kit either, it is too small with odd pockets. Next purchase will probably be DeWalt.**Update**This Bosch kit came with a 3-year ""Proadvantage"" warranty (which is a very good deal). Customer service was superb. I'm currently waiting on my jigsaw replacement now. So I'll upgrade my review from 2-stars to 3-stars."
3,Read instructions carefully,"This product either will work for you, or not. You need to read all of the instructions carefully so you know what you can expect, and how to get the best results. Initially, it WILL cause an increase in hair loss. This is normal and you should expect it. You won't see any growth result until you've used it for about 12 weeks. Hair has a definite growth cycle and it requires time. Giving it less than 12 weeks won't tell you if it is working for you or not. I noticed a little bit of dullness on my hair where the liquid dried on it. There is also some irritation, but my Dr. gave me something for that."
2,No results after 2 months of use,"I'm not sure how long I'm supposed to use this product to see results, but, after 2 months of use, I have not seen any growth of hair!!"
4,Having thinning hair,"It's working I will be buying it again and would recommend this product to a friend,i was nervous thought I would be allergic"
1,Not good,"Makes you dizzy. Besides that, they test it on animals, not wash it off from their skin and let them be tortured this way. Want to sponsor them so they continue this? Your choice."
3,Nothing new here,"The book goes into great lengths into comparing business and theatre. Concepts of rapid iteration, small groups and ""playing"" are mentioned in the book.No new concepts... they just went deep into the comparisons. The read is a bit boring."
5,Should be required reading in our education system.,"Mr. Thomas has taken a step by step description of crime control through the prisons, the police, and the courts not only to show how they are not working; but also to show realistic changes that should be made if our society is to continue to exist. In light of the Littleton, Colorado tragedy, this books shows solutions that are light years ahead of anything I've seen coming from the experts shown on tv. 5 stars or more to Mr. Thomas, and he should run for President or at least have his book placed in every school and home where it should be read and enjoyed as much as I have enjoyed reading it."
4,Great Book but Boring,"This is a great book. However, the chapters are long and can be boring.Also, if you hate math then you might be a little annoyed at all the simple exercises using basic math. Maybe, if Ivor Horton referenced food instead .. hmmmm.One other downer about this book ... as you get more advanced you will find yourself working on only one example. The author should have used new examples in each chapter to help the learning experience.I've found that if you work with one example and someone misses something along the way ... they will have difficulty as they progress.Other than that ... this is a great book and very well written. You will definitely learn a lot reading this tutorial.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone!"
3,For Programmers..?,"This book is great if you want insight into designing interfaces, but not so great if you want to have any idea of what best practices are in C++. The code examples that he created and put on his website have both the function declarations and the functions themselves in the header files. He doesn't even mention anything about best practices with header files, which is a pretty important part of the language.This might be a good book to have in your library if you use Visual Studio, but I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner in C++. Find something else to learn from."
1,Ivor Horton's Deceit,"It would be dishonest to sell this book over the internet without warning the prospective C++ aspirant that one would need at minimum the use of Visual Studio 2005 Standard edition, not the C++ Express edition, with this book.For this deceit by the author I give it only 1 star, because the book is useless to me without my being able to afford to buy the needed software."
1,A book worth not having,"I found this book of little or no use. When a buy a book that is this big (1180 pages) you think, ""Wow this thing is so big it must be the one."" I am more and more of a mind that programming books that are bloated are just poorly thought out. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Visual Studio C++,"Having read the feedback from those people who reviewed the Ivor's book and who gave the book an excellent grade prompted me to buy this book, which I find ridicule since it does not teach you anything about Visual C++ programing. Even though the book does provide an antiquated amount of old C++, it does not bring the essence that makes Visual Studio 2005, The Apollo Toy, which provides an infinitesimal amount of programing. Save you money and buy Deitel instead. Deitel's book does give you a great jump start to Visual Studio 2005. I do not know if to dump Ivor's in the garbage or else."
1,Do not buy this book,"You probably see a lot of His book. Just do not buy it.It spends 2/3 talk about C++, the rest of 1/3 on something else.The title is cheating and false. I would call it a bad C_++ book."
4,Good but could use a reprint,"This is a good book to learn the C++ language from the ground up. Good coverage of ANSI and CLR C++. Also covered making GUI inside C++ using MFC and .NET.My edition is full of typos. This book would get 5 stars if a good proofreader did their job and the book was reissued. Most of the corrections are available from the published. However, the typos are so annoying and pervasive, the book sufferes."
5,"Zelda, The best video game series ever.. Review by: Jesse",This is the best game for the SNES hands down!When i got this..this...treasure i just kept playing it and playing it and playing it. until...7 months later...i beat the game...and then..i kept completing it over and over and over.... well.. here is my score for itGraphics: 7/10Sound: 6/10Gameplay: 10/10Replay Value: 8/10Overall: 7/10I have three words for you...buy this game! :P
5,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,This game is fantastic! Totally true to the classic Zelda format and only 16 bits! I'm definitely addicted and wool continue to make purchases from this user in the future.
4,A SNES goody!,"Just as the original Zelda game, A Link to the Past depends on exploring. If you study the land carefully you will find many secrets and will learn what is going on and what to do. The game has a nice bird's eye view and the general graphics are decent for 1992. Unlike the original, you do not travel a 128-screen land deprived of people and life. There are townspeople roaming around and HUMAN baddies in areas. The shops are more detailed and the dungeons aren't just a bunch of tiles with something different in it (don't worry, I still like the original). You have the ability to charge your sword and do a spin attack and learn new moves after most dungeons. This is an enjoyable game and is worth every penny you spend on it (I got it from a friend for only a small trade. He he!) A must buy indeed!"
2,"Not really my thing, but I respect it as a classic","Don't get me wrong, its an ok game, its kinda fun, at the same time I don't see why this game is so amazing. The music is suppose to be good, I thought it didn't do the SNES sound chip any justice. Gameplay is quite repetitive, I know a lot of games can be repetitive but its a repition that bores me. Your constantly locating stuff, that got boring. But I will say, if I was bored or just killing time before I go out it would be good for a few rounds to play. The story line is pretty impressive, so I guess the game deserves props in that area. The game is good in its own little ways, but I just don't rank it up there with some of the other classics. I have some friends that love this game, so I guess I respect it for what it is."
1,Is the 3rd time always the charm?,"Please don't get extremist on me, but I don't really like this game. It's overrated and I will stick to the first Legend of Zelda that's way better than this! Newer Zelda games are NOT my thing."
5,Wow,This game is one of the best videogames I have ever played on any console and I have played games on almost evey console made to date. This is a classic game and should be played by everyone who loves games. This is one that proves you do not need fancy 3d graphics to have a truly great game.
5,This is one of my favorite SNES games!!,"I absolutely love playing this game, and I hope to play it again in the future! I haven't been able to play it for a while, but what I liked about it is that there was always so much to do in the game. Explore dungeons, collect rupies, defeat bad guys, this game is awesome!!"
3,links adventure(nes) and links awakening(gb) much better than link to the past,When this game first came out i did not have a snes so i had to watch my friend down the road play it and i never got to spoiled. Well its about 20 years later and i am about to beat it and am pretty disappointed. The game is way to easy I played it for like one week at nights and Im already to Gannon. I played the first one right before link to the past and it took much longer and was much more satisfying exploring and beating the dungeons even though graphically inferior. A link to the past is a beautiful looking and sounding snes game but there just not enough to explore and its to easy especially the puzzles so easy.I cant believe im done with the game I pretty much dont even feel like going ahead and finishing off gannon. I would recommend links awakening on the gameboy and gameboy color way better game in every aspect its how link to the past should have ben.
5,Best one in the series.,"Pack in a quest-oriented version of the original The Legend of Zelda with updated graphics including a 3D overworld map and a new storyline scenario, and there you go. Graphics for SNES are a 4.5/5, sound and music is a 4.5/5, fun is a 5/5. One of the top 100 of SNES titles."
5,Awesome Game for Super NES!!!,"I've owned this game for several years and it's awesome. Especially for when it was made. All the levels are challenging and there are plenty of them. I am also pleased that this game isn't anywhere near as simple as N64 games(Which usually take me like 3 days to master when I first get them). I wouldn't suggest this game to those of you who don't enjoy actually having to use your brain in a game to beat it. The only problem is that after you've completed the game, its very, very easy to play new files and get them done in no time.Excellent game. Buy it now."
4,The story of the Legend of Zelda,Great I love it. The game is cool they sould make the game harder and have more boss's than before. If you have not play the game you sould because the game is any other game that I play before in year's. I have two games of (Zelda) there are (The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time) and (The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask) there are a great game you sould go and buy it and play it yourself. The game is fun you get to go places like under water on top of a mountain's and in cold caves inside a big fish and forest's ocean's rocky mountain's and graveyard's. nd saveing the world in the nick of time from evil king Ganondorf and stop evil monsters in each dungeon in the game. and saveing the world again... Now go play the game.PS. play (The Legend of Zelda: A link to the past) that's a good one too.
4,Feeling a little backed up?,"As embarrassing as this is to review, it worked swimmingly. I had reservations about using something like this because I do not bat for the men's team and I'm not a switch hitter, but it was gentle and non-life-changing. Strait guy approved."
2,the colors.......the colors,"yeah, well this hat is listed as ""charcoal"" in color. beware though b/c you will get a cap that looks different from the picture, like the actual shade or color. In this case the photo shows a dark gray (charcoal) but in reality it's a very ""lighter"" gray......this company needs either a better camera or a photographer with a just a whim of common sense. boy am i pissed....however the quality of material is good, but not great, that is why it it gets an extra star....ooooooh"
5,Rock painting.,"Painting on Rocks for Kids.We had great fun using this book after our Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone choose a rock and we had a paint party with 12 people painting rocks together. Some followed the book (like me) and others just went with their own ideas and got their creative juices flowing.Oh, one important thing...you don't have to be a kid to use this book. We had a great time doing this."
5,One of the best books we've ever bought!,"We bought this book for our four year old Granddaughter for Christmas. She absolutley LOVES this book. She loves rocks and loves to paint. It is an excellent family activity also. We got the rocks at our local garden center although, we live in the country and have gathered rocks from the creek too which added to the fun. We've painted on both and they are wonderful. The first time she came over after Christmas is when we used the book. We spent hours painting and she felt really good after seeing what she had created. We even got her Uncles (ages 18 and 19) involved and we all had great fun with this. I would recommend this book for all ages!"
5,This Book Rocks,This book provided some excellet ideas on how to use simple rocks to make interesting art objects. Instructions were clear and simple.
3,This is NOT an atomic watch!,"I have been trying to find the right atomic watch for several months now. I was very excited when I found this one, however VERY disappointed when I received it and found out it was NOT atomic. So I set it and kept it as I am tired of looking."
1,"If you want Atomic, Don't buy this!","This is not Atomic. if you want a women's atomic watch, try theTimex Women's Watch #T5G341Most atomic watches will have ""radio controlled"" printed right on the watch."
4,Not The Best Ever,"The book sure did get a lot of hype, so much so I thought it was going to prove to be one of the better ones I have ever read. The positive this is that man this book is fast, you get going and it just keep clicking along. I found my self routing for the hero of the story in a kind of ""go get um - more violence"" kind of way. The action rich story line is well put together and read like it was going straight to Hollywood. The only real down side for me, and the reason I did not think it was a great book, is that the hype I heard made me get really excited to read it. I was disappointed with the relationship of the two lead characters, also too off the self for me - They could not get the good cop, bad cop combo so they went with the vigilante / reporter. That really is a bit nit picking on my part, the book is quite cool, really holds your attention and is fun to read - after all that is probably why we buy the things."
5,AWESOME!!!,"ive read hagberg, weber and even clancy, but no one has even come close to this character.i even named my rottweiler after him;""cully"". it's about time some one didnt play by the rules and mike culley broke every rule possible. from stealing back his harley to pulling the trigger in the end. this is a character every american wants to be...family,america,self! thanks mr elliot. looking forward to another 'culley' adventure..."
2,boring,"this add on is very boring you barely get anything new in your game just fancy formal clothes and not a lot of furniture, it is not worth it nothing looks good"
4,second only to seeing them!,"The only reason this album doesn't get five stars is because you have to see these guys in action to fully enjoy the great vibe and energy that they give off at their shows! I've been going to see MBK since I was in high school (I guess that makes me one of the original fans!) and they're always showstopping! If you've never seen them live, this will make you know what you've been missing, and if you have, it will help relive the great memories of singing along and dancing your fool head off. Ross and Company, all top of the line musicians, are Kings indeed! Thanks, guys!"
4,Kings Come Alive,"Caught the group before a small but enthusiastic audience at an albuquerque niteclub. This album captures the niteclub aura nicely. strong vocals, great guitar and firing-on-all-cylinders sax and drums, persuaded me to buy. The lead singer is mature beyond his years and the group presents a very polished, if not yet quite five star performance. I am sure that is coming. ""Green Grass' is a higlight cut with audience participation that simply blows the doors off. Other great tracks: 'ragtop' 'buzz, buzz, buzz' The King's cover of jimi hendrixs' 'manic depression' is the only miss on this lp but i thought it showed the bands creativity in going after it. i have fond memories of that albuquerque concert and this live chicago recording warms me up each time I spin it. For swing, vocal jazz and blues fans the Mighty Blue Kings are a sure swing."
5,It'll Make You Want to Pack and Go!,"I've seen many documentaries about Morocco, but this is the most thorough, thoughtful, and well-rounded one. Rick Ray is a masterful cinematographer, but he also includes a lot of historical and cultural information with the eye candy. He visits every spot a first-time visitor wants to see, and then some. He covers Fez and Marrakech, and also the Middle Atlas and the Merzouga Dunes. Before seeing this, I was a bit apprehensive about shopping/bargaining . . . others make it seem intimidating, but Rick treats it quite properly as a fun game (as do the Moroccans). In fact, Moroccans come off as universally charming and hospitable. If he gives short shrift to any topic, it's the food (he's obviously not a foodie). If you are fortunate enough to actually be planning a trip to Morocco, you'll definitely want to see this film."
4,Pitfall isn't that bad of a game.,"Graphics are excellent for a super nintendo game. Challenging at first, since you are unable to save a game if you have quit. But overall, it's pretty good."
5,Remarkable,"The author's ability to realistically convey two worlds at polar ends of the spectrum is truly remarkable. The characters and plot is more compelling than Pat Barker's trilogy, Birdsong, or Cold Mountain. As a voracious reader of WWI history and literature this novel captures, for me, the essence of the horror, pointlessness, and madness of WWI while drawing a detail picture of Native American culture at the turn of the century. Belongs with modern day classics."
4,Fulfilling yet haunting tale,"The depiction of Native Canadian Cree Indians turned World War I soldiers Xavier Bird and Elijah Whiskeyjack, is a haunting and enticing story. The story weaves between that of Xavier's Aunt Niska, an old Cree Indian living as her ancestors did, in the woods, hunting, divining, and fulfilling her spiritually duty as a killer of cannibals, and the trench warfare of WWI as Xavier and his friend Elijah are join the ranks of the white Canadians and Europeans. Readers are easily pulled into the tales of all three main characters as they each struggle with the psychological repercussions of the acts of killing. The story string of morphine addiction weaves in an around the themes of killing, cultural absorption and the breaking of the mind. Quick read, especially for anyone fascinated by Indian culture."
5,a quiet novel about another horrid war,"Having read many books dealing with the insanity of WWI, this volume stands apart. It is beautifully and seamlessly written as it moves from the war experience of Cree snipers to Cree ritual and rehabilitation of the returned ""hero"" of war. The untold horrors of the war square with fact and the shifts to the overarching and loving work of the Aunt to rescue her beloved nephew make for a moving read."
5,Prepare to be taken on a journey,"Wow, simply spectacular book! As the other reviewers have greatly outlined the story I will just say that this book will stay with me for a very long time. When I finished it, I just sat and cried for Xavier, for all the lives lost in the wars, for the hate in humans that made Native Indians a second class humans."
1,Politically correct junk literature,"Very interesting at first. I thought it would be an excellent book - but then it got all wrapped up in unstoppable super-indian almost effortlessly slaughtering (and scalping) hundreds of ""Huns"", and the only thing that could stop the unstoppable super-indian was...the other super-indian!"
3,Three Day Road,"I was glad to see the book come as fast as it did.I expected the book to be in better shape, there is a black mark on the bottom of the book and the seal was broken.The book was listed as ""new"""
1,Disappointed-Metro Collection 3-in-1(tm) Torchiere Floor Lamp,"We purchased this lamp from Lamps Plus in March 2010 and were very happy until it stoppped working suddenly in September when the main bulb burned out. We tried to return it and were told we had to to take it to a repair shop for an estimate. It's a large, heavy lamp. The repair person said it could not be fixed so now we must take it back to the store and hope that we will get a refund or a credit. Will update with the Lamps Plus response."
3,"Good sound, basic features","After I've done a lot of research I finally bought this boombox.What's true about it is that it sounds very good, better than I expected.On the other hand, the remote is pretty useless. You cannot change between cd/tuner/tape, you cannot control the tape at all. You cannot turn the boombox off.That was disappointing.As other reviewers already said, the display does not have backlight.Because of the standard controls it's hard to play the tenth (just an example) song on a cd. You don't have numbers on the remote and you have to press next ten times.Conclusion: If you want a classic boombox with an excellent sound (of course, for its class), go for it. If you want something with extra features and more comfort for you, try something else (for example, Panasonic RX-ES25). That's if you still want a boombox... :)"
1,Beware! Spyware included!,Customers beware! This CD ontains malware that will damage your Windows OS!
2,4 stars for music 0 stars for CD,"This is yet another CD with the silly copy protection that prevents you from making direct copies with Nero or Adaptec. The software on the CD installs automatically when you insert the CD and prevents listening to the CD quality audio on your computer. You are forced to listen to lossy WMA versions. Just make sure you have ""autorun"" disabled on your computer so the software doesn't install on your computer automatically."
3,average album,"Its hard not to compare a band with their older works, even though it can pigeonhole them into a certain sound or style. These guys are no different, even with the long hiatus. The same that has been said many times about this album I can say myself as well, when i started listening to track 2 ""Last Cigarette"" I thought I was listening to circa ""Tiny Music..."" Stone Temple Pilots. The album has an uplifting feel to it which is a complete 180 from River Runs Red for sure. Everything sounds decent, but after finishing the album I felt it was an empty generic effort. Nothing any different than the 100's of other bands out there at the moment. That is sad because LOA was never like this in the early days. I would definitely recommend starting with River Runs Red then Ugly. Soul Searching Sun vs This one is a tough call but I never listented to much of SSS.That being said, the live show is still insanely good. Never a let down in that aspect of LOA."
2,UUUUUUMMMMMMM.....,"There's 2 LOA's, the River Runs Red, and the band they became after. Well, being a huge fan of their first CD, I always found it hard to get into any of their other CDs. I think River Runs Red will always be their shining Star. It just reminds me of the local NYC hardcore scene\ and how great and excitting it was back in the 90s. This is a different road for LOA, just hope they dont stay on it."
1,what a waste of money!!,"this is the biggest piece of crap i have heard in a long time!! how can you get back together and play shows that are called the river runs red again playing mostly old good-heavy stuff and then put out this!!!i can't begin to voice enough dissapointment in this cd,then i hear the band saying that this is their most aggressive album HA-HA-HA!!!! what a friggin joke!! joey z has a guitar tone about as thick as a piece of paper and the songs are all WEAK!!!! what ever happened to the band that put out the river runs red(one of my top 5 albums of all time) and could i PLEASE have them back,as it stands i will NEVER!!EVER!! buy another cd from this band and i have been a fan for a long time(back to before river runs red actually came out). please do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this as you can if you like ugly or river runs red-i just wish i could give this negative stars!!!"
1,"""Love to Let You Down"" - Keith's message to LOA fans?","Wow, listening to this is painful. This album is ""Ugly."" Was this a joke? LOA really let us fans down on this one. Hey Keith, take notes while touring with Megadeth and Dream Theater..."
1,wow this is awful,They actually play this garbage on Headbangers ball. How absolutely unenjoyable to listen to. These guys are beyond weak.
3,Agony lives...kinda,"LOA is my favorite band, that being said, this is not their best album. Some people will say that they have matured and moved on with their style and they can't have a River Runs Red every time out and I would beg to differ. Their lyrics could change and the pace of the music could remain and that would be maturity. I was hoping for something a bit faster like a River Runs Red and even Ugly. This is certainly better than Soul Searching Sun but not asd good as any others. I still love them but they are beginning to sound like the band Live with darker lyrics. I will still buy every album they put out and I will hope each time to hear at least one song that still remembers the thrash of their youth."
3,"Better than SSS, not even close to the rest","Well this was not a return to form for LOA. Much better than SSS in that it is a much more sincere album. I can hear Keith's emotion in his deteriorating voice. On SSS, all I heard was apathy sung over a bunch of convoluted songs. There is definitely an STP vibe, with some Quicksand maybe. Not really heavy, but there are some good songs & riffs. More than a fair share of bad songs though. I would check out Love to Let You Down, The Calm That Disturbs You, Don't Bother & Junk Sick (though the chorus sucks). Just under 3 stars."
2,Stone Temple Pilots?,"I dont'mind this cd but I was really hoping to buy a new LOA album that had hints of the heaviness they once possessed with their previous stuff (a band can progress and still be heavy). I did not want to buy a new STP album, which this album sounds uncannily like. Verdict...disappointed as I was REALLY psyched about this reunion and new album."
3,"Good, but Inconsistent","I was glad to see LOA back in form with a new album. I was not expecting another River Runs Red or Ugly. As I've grown up, so should the sound of the good bands that I liked in my youth.Now, saying that, this new LOA album starts off strong. Then after track 5, the songs are complete hit or miss. More misses than hits.The CD is too short - at least record 60minutes worth of music guys, come on.The vocals by Keith are very different - very, very similar to Scott Weiland on some tracks, and on others its all original. The music itself is solid - great licks by Joey Z. , and the rythym is consistent as always.I hope they release more albums, as I dig the new sound. But I hope they are more consistent next time."
3,disappointing,"I was totally excited to hear this album, then I played it. It's velvet revolver without the pop. any album that takes a hundred plus listenings to (like this one did) to get into it, isn't worth the aking price. the only song that grabbed me was the day he died, a song written about the heroin death of Keith's father."
1,"Good for better understanding of the story, but...","Rydl's overwhelming bass 'flutter' is absolutely horrible and is impossible to overlook when listening and watching this dvd. Because of his horrible singing I find this dvd unwatchable. If anyone reading this review owns a cd of the opera with Kurt Moll as Osmin (and loves it), I warn you specifically to avoid this well produced but poorly cast dvd."
5,Wonderful,"This opera is a delight from start to finish. In particular, Kurt Rydl does a spectacular job as Osmin. I own two versions of The Magic Flute and two of The Marriage of Figaro. I won't be buying any other version of this opera; this is THE one. Sound quality, set design, and direction are great. My only qualm: I wish the original German were available as a subtitle option."
2,"""I felt like I was visiting Milwaukee, my hometown.""","I enjoyed reading the descriptions of Milwaukee flavored by a bit of history. I especially appreciated the dining spots of Milwaukee. It brought back many memories. Since I am an old Nancy Drew fan, I felt Beth was Nancy as a mature detective."
5,Radiology made simple,Dr. Wolbarst makes excellent use of charts and graphs to illustrate the basics of medical imaging.Recommended for anyone intrigued by the amazing CT and MRI scans.
4,Very good value,"You can spend more (a lot more) for better cosmetics but as far as functional, this is a good as it gets. 400 lbs with no counter weights in 1/4 lb increment-markings. It is mechanical using one of the oldest principles of physics so it has to work every time. It can't not work.Only drawback is instructional book is completely out-of-date. You will have to figure out how to put it together but it is not too hard (hint: lay the scale down and have someone press the balance beam toward the base to have enough slack to hook the beam transverse to the platform brace).The company I purchased this from (through Amazon) got the scale to my house in two (2) working days."
4,Marvelous account of the film.,"If you liked this movie, you will like this book even more. It is perhaps one of the best books about the making of a film ever written. You will even get a chance to enjoy the script, and the actors' thoughts. Director Copppola is quoted throughout, as well as the costume designers, and other people involved. However, I felt, as I read through the book, that there was not enough about Gary Oldman, who starred as Dracula. I was looking forward to more of HIS insights than any one else's, for it was HE who brought such new and wonderful emotions to the role. The pictures in the book are wonderful. Drawings and little un-known facts are everywhere, making this truly an interesting read."
3,If you like stories of suvival...,"Obviously not the best in its series, but an extremely good story of the rediscovery of humanity in a heartwrenching world."
5,Better than the movie...obviously,"This book is obviously and almost always is better than the movie.The movie wasn't as violent as the book,In fact if Miller had followed the sript this movie would have been rated R rather than PG-13.It is almost exactly the same as the movie with little things removed from them.Such as The Collector,In the movie he lives and in the novel,Aunty's tower falls on him.The movie also has the leg brace on his leg from ""The Road Warrior"" but is still a good reader."
4,L. Frank Baum!,"L. Frank Baum wrote the lyrics to this classic book. I've only heard 1 track (Littletown) but it was a fun-sounding Halloweeny album for kids!Following info from www.pearlandthepumpkin.comC.D. Cast Joe-Marty Thomas.

1,Don't waste your money . . . 1/2 STAR,"This has to be the worst book ever published. The author's attempts to show off as an 'insider' of Wall Street lead the reader onto a long boring journey of no interest between the protagonist, a young Wall-streeter, and a control-freak antagonist so poorly created it pained me to continue this story. I have to say I stopped reading Assets and Lies by Robert Geis because I think the only lie was that this book was worthy of publishing.The author should have considered hiring an editor to assist him in creating a compelling plot line, not to mention character development - which there was very little. As for the touted machinations of being an insider's book about the Mutual Fund industry, well, from what I read in the New York Times or the New York Post, I've read as much about the subject matter as Geis writes in his book. Overall this was a poor display writing in an area that is most interesting."
5,Prince of Splattervania,"This to me was a solid action title complete with creepy sounds, graphics, you name it. It plays a bit like Prince of Persia/Flash Back, in that you'll be doing the whole ""jump up, grab platform"" ""run jump, grab platform"" ""roll under low ceiling"" thing. At least I seem to recall rolling under things. It's been a while. None the less, it's prince of Persia, with a sort of Castlevania without a whip feel, so I guess you might also compare it to Splatter House.All in all, I can't complain."
3,Hard vampire,"This game would be atleast a 4 star if it wasn't so hard , i mean im not trying to be a babie but i think it is impossible to get out of the first leval , but that is probably my fault. If your not stupid you would know this movie is based on the first ever vampire movie , it came out in 1929 and it was a silent film , game nothing like the classic movie but i think i would recommend this game if you r a expirenced game player , get while you still can."
3,The worst of the Jefferson projects,"Don't get me wrong. I am a HUGE fan of Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship. I am a longtime listener of both groups.However, I can't say the same for Starship. At this point, the legendary 1960s rockers were limited down to four members, and almost the entire Jefferson Starship lineup had moved on. Unlike the previous two Jefferson projects, Starship was leaning towards 1980s pop.I like some '80s pop, and I do like 'We Built This City' and 'Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now.' However, other than those two songs, I didn't like them. They are a little too poppy for my tastes.If you're a longtime Jeffersons fan like I am, than this is a welcome addition to your collection. Otherwise, I would stick to buying Jefferson Starship and Jefferson Airplane albums. I would even try their installments in the 'Platinum & Gold Collection' series.Recommended for '80s pop-rock and Jeffersons fans."
2,oops,"This isn't Rival's fault, but I was looking for an accessory hose to fit my pro-2300 vacuum sealer. This did not and I needed to send it back. Bummer. Wish I'd read the directions more carefully."
1,Haven't I read this 100 times before?,"This book is a strange mishmash of other authors beliefs about the Gunfight at the Ok Corral mixed in with some really corny drivelings from the author (My God, where did we get such men?).It's quite apparent that the author Hickey merely rewrote the works of Ben Traywick and therefore the works of Glenn Boyer.Nothing original here, no primary research-all sources appear secondary.The author also has a rather arrogant way of presenting himself to his readers which merely makes him less likeable."
4,Well liked!,Bought this for my brother for Christmas who loves his music and others like him (Ian Tyson) and he has enjoyed the CD.
1,Not What I Expected,"This book was not at all what I was expecting. Having read an article about this project and the author in a magazine, I was expecting a detailed history of the project, with comments from the author, pictures of the excavations, overall maps of the area, specific locations of tombs, and pictures or descriptions of artifacts inside. What I got was a book of blueprints of the tombs - interesting to some, perhaps, but not what I wanted."
3,Didn't go to Miami!,"This version was out of stock, so I never got my copy! I was sad, because I really wanted this version, and I love everything Will Smith!"
5,This game is cool!,"This game is great! If you like Battletoads or Double Dragons, then this game is for you! Good graphics, funny slapstick comedy, and it's challenging! Get this game!"
4,EXCELLENT,This is a CAPITAL work for all people interested in what true Tantra is and not the Western ersatz versions that abound in the US. I am NOT a fan of paperbacks and regret the non-availability of a harback copy
4,"Interesting, detailed overivew.","I bought this book, not because I wanted to tune up my engine, but rather I was interested in the topic and what people do. The book is well laid out and easy to follow. Since I didn't try any of the techniques I can't comment on their effectiveness, but they made sense. The book also goes into some of the pitfalls (for example fitting weber carbs and seeing performance go down because other necessary tuning to make them work has not been done)."
2,Don't waste your money,"Unless you're new to engine building, you'll be disappointed. There's not much info here that you can't get from service manuals or the web, the book's not very well written, and it's _very_ poorly edited.YMMV, but I'd leave this one on the shelf."
3,Bad Touch Screen,"This unit served me well for a few years, but then the touch screen started to get majorly calibrated. As another reviewer said, you would have to touch a bit to the left or right of a button to get it to go. Eventually it got so bad it was virtually useless. I took it apart and tried to fix it- now it doesn't work at all. I'm tired of putting up with Pioneer: exorbitant service fees, poor user interfaces, and screens that go bad."
3,"Good Pioneer quality head unit, bad touch screen","I purchased a vehicle with this already installed in it, and I must say it is not the head unit I would have chosen. The touch screen forces me to poke endlessly about an inch from the actual button image, and sometimes it acts as if it is a larger screen while watching movies. It is difficult to use the touchscreen to surf burned mp3 CDs, but I have been told by Pioneer that if I want to drive about 45 min from where I live I can pay a service tech to re-calibrate the screen. I am very reluctant to do this, in that I really do not enjoy the touchscreen. I will say that it is a good head unit in its sound quality. If you can pick this up for under 200, it's not that bad."
2,hohum,To be honest lets start with the fact that anyone with a good point and shoot camera can do as good a job with the photographs of these models. The photos were at best amature..even the posing was dull..seems that most of the models had some problem with their hands...always wanting to cover up something...this book would be a lot better if the models had some direction as to how to pose...also some of the photos were blured for some reason. The book would be alot better if the models would get out of the bath room!
1,unpleasant,"I threw this book out into the garbage can. Somehow it did not evoke any positive emotion in me. I like beautiful images. Maybe I misunderstand something but there is really something very disturbing about this book - it is very unpleasant and it is way too explicit to be called art. I would rather label it as ""porn"" but I guess it does not quite make it into that category either. It is indeed my personal opinion and I AM picky but hey, that's MY review. I would rather get myself a book of beautiful Patrick Demarchelier's photos."
5,Best games I ever bought,"This is my first review. All of the games work perfectly. I loved ADVENTURE and have played it dozens of times so far. This was about the first RPG game, and it took me back so many years. At 25 cents per game, this is the best bargain in history. (Skip the INTELLIVISION ten game pack for the pc. What a disappointment). The extras are wonderful also. Interviews with the founder of Atari are very interesting. My only complaint are that the instructions don't seem to be printable, but the games are not that difficult. Many of the progressive games have children's levels, which is about all that I can handle. Missile Command is fun when you can do more than two screens! The later games like Super Breakout have prettier colors, and are a blast. If you want to see video game history or want to go back to your youth, buy this fabulous collection. I can't make much progress on the arcade versions, but they are beautifully rendered. Quarter snatchers indeed!!!!"
5,No Better Way To Drop Eighteen Bucks,"These games are presented in a manner befitting the Smithsonian. This is the electronic equivalent of Hollywood's silent films. Classics of design, where gameplay reigned supreme. It is hard to emphasize the legacy to which these titles have conditioned us. From the quirky Canyon Bomber to the supreme Tempest ( S video recommended ) the nostalgia will flow like a good Sauvignon. Anyone aged 30+ who ever used their lunch or laundry money as an expense account at the local arcade should be legally required to make this purchase."
1,80 classics minus the best.....!,"Why is it that everything they come out w/doesnt actually have a collection of the best.. only a few. This cd, like all the rest, is missing the great games like frogger, ms. pacman, and donkey kong!"
1,It is a waste of money!,I can't believe that the grahic is worse than the one I played 20 years ago. It is for collection not for playing.
1,HORRIBLE,THIS GAME IS HORIBLE YOU THINK THAT 20 YEARS LATER THEY WOULD HAVE FIXED THE SKIPPING AND FREAZING WELL THEY DID NOT MOST GAME ARE NOT EVEN THE SAME THING COMPLEAT WASTE OF MONEY IT SUCKS
1,Great if you've forgotten your childhood entirely,"When you think of an arcade game you don't think of a cheap Commodore 64-style, blocky cheap game with no graphic-detail. In the early 80's Missile command, Millipede, etc. looked pretty good. I can't believe Atari failed to emmulate their own games and instead made it look like someone pirated the concept but not the accuracy. The warranty for this product says you can't return it if it's been opened. Unfortunately I opened it. And then I played some of the games. Things went downhill from there.My wife doesn't like me to play violent games like GTA, Max Payne, Halo, etc. but this Atari collection insures I'll be playing them for some time to come."
3,Mildly Disappointing,"The good thing about these games is that they do work OK on a modern XP system. Some of them are pretty much as I remember the originals, for example Pong, Centipede, Millipede. I've been looking for a Circus Atari type game for a long time - I used to love that game. Well, that one doesn't hold up to the passage of time and the rudimentary graphics make it boring.If you do get this set; many of the games are hard to play with a mouse, and I found a game pad and a joystick pretty unresponsive. What works best for me is a rollerball.This package isn't very expensive so if you long for the old Atari games, its satisfying enough. It's not great."
2,Not what I expected.,"I wanted the old Atari games that would play on my PC, but I have to use the keyboard and getting it to work right has been too much hassle."
1,The One Rating Is For Judy Collins.,"First of all I must say the CD and the artists here are first class but I,am giving this a 1 do to the fact that singer Judy Collins who was on this show and claims to be a great proponent of Public television ,but apparently lied about that because here we have a cd that proceeds would go to Public Broadcasting but she along with her record company would not allow her songs during this show to be included here in this cd collection from the PBSpecial.I think it is very poor of her to not have gone to the record company and tell them that she wanted her songs from the special included here being it was for PBS.So in the long run PBS did a fine job here but unfortunately judy Collins and her record company did not."
3,Well written but very oridinary,"In the Cambridgeshire Fens, a car is pulled from the frozen river. In the trunk is a man's body. Philip Dryden, reporter for a local weekly newspaper, investigates the story. Things get a bit more exciting when another body is found on the roof of the Ely Cathedral adjacent to a stone gargoyle. This body is felt to be decades old. Is there a connection between the two deaths? The answer, unfortunately might very well prove dangerous to Dryden.THE WATER CLOCK is a very well written but a very ordinary British crime novel. In spite of some very well done characterizations, the plot was simply uninteresting. The use of stock devices such as the villian holding a gun on the hero at the end while all is divulged did not help elevate this book much beyond average. This is a surprising nomination for the Creasey Award."
2,Disappointing debut,"Once again I'm mystified by how a book I thought was barely readable could be short-listed for a literary award and receive glowing reviews from writers like Colin Dexter and Val McDermid. The story outline sounded so promising, yet the author got bogged down in page after page of uneven, jerky narrative, none of which moved the plot forward or made me feel that I knew any of the characters better. It was like wading through treacle. In the end I was so bored and frustrated that I looked at the ending, just to get it over with. Some of the descriptive writing was good - the occasional phrase or sentence even memorable - but for me, the action never really got going, I didn't care about any of the characters and there was no feeling of tension or suspense. A very unexciting read."
2,"Well-crafted, but not much else.","I can understand why some people might find this book to be a nice change of pace to the dross that James Patterson and Patricia Cornwell are releasing, but I'm with those who found it rather underwhelming.For one thing, there is just far too much description. At one point - towards the end - we get a four-page explanation as to why the Fens is going to flood. I found this a little more than was necessary. Also, the severe lack of dialogue made the characters very hard to identify with. How can I get to know these people if they barely even speak? Dryden's cab driver ""Humph"" was so dull I wondered why he was even included in the plot.In the end, everything tied up very well. If Kelly can combine his obvious gift for plotting with better character development and a less show-offy writing style, he could find himself up there with Jonathan Kellerman and Michael Connelly."
2,Don't Understand the Rave Reviews,"I won't go into what the book is about since others have done that but I will say that I found this book very dull. I am a fairly fast reader and this is a short book but it took me days to get through because I just couldn't get interested in the people or the ""mystery."""
1,Never Again!!!,"Yet another ""how-to-guide"" for web design. My wife purchasedthe book because she thought she could hit the groundrunning with creating a web page for her home business.Well she hit the ground alright, and the cleanup wasn'tpretty. After many frustrating hours i recommended afew good Internet sites on basic HTML and web designwhich provided a step by step process for design andgave a clear explanation of HTML ""Tags"" and formatting.Save Your Money!!!!!"
1,Nothing New Here,"I ended up returning this book. I hope that the reader from Ohio was an elementary school child, that's what it seems that the audience was for the book.Don't get me wrong, if you're under the age of 12 this book is great! However, if you're an adult you need something more to sink your teeth into."
1,A Total Rip-Off,I agree with Stan. This book has the same cookie-cutter format as a dozen other books. The author lacks creativity and knowledge in the area of web design.I feel sorry for anyone who wastes their money on this book.
1,Buy a Real Book on Web Design,"The language used in this book is that of a five year old child (and I'm being nice!). This is exemplified by the following quote from the book: ""Many animals use sound to communicate what's up.""There are other books on the market that are MUCH better. This book barely scratches the surface of web design. The author does not have a full grasp of web design technologies. This book may be appropriate elementary school kids.At the collegiate level this book is a joke. It's as if the author is talking to a child and his bandwidth examples are arbitrary.Don't waste your money!"
5,"Absolutely the best books, she's great!","When I need infor on watercolor, her books are first resource--so worth the money. Jan really shares her knowledge and generates confidence to the artist."
3,Not my favorite watercolor instructions,"I liked that the sketches are included but the directions are a bit spotty and the graphics aren't very clear so it's not as easy to follow as it could be. Also, the projects are a bit dated, but since this was a used book, it's as advertised."
2,Sony DAV-FX500 XM - CD/DVD STACKER BROKEN,"My CD Stacker/DVD Stacker broke right after the year warrantee ran out also!!! I bought it for my husband for a Christmas present and we have been using it all year, but then in February one year and one month later, it won't play any movies. Sad to say we are using my eight year old daughter's DVD player from WAL-MART that works great and it was a whopping $29.98!"
4,easy to assemble,We purchased this product Feb 07.It is very easy to install. We had a problem with the DVD player not ejecting the disc. It is a 5 disc changer and we could never load any more than 1 disc ( thank goodness). I called Sony to see if they had any suggestions and they said to send it to them but it would take a month to get it back. Luckily we also contacted Amazon and they replaced our defective unit(within 3 days) and they even paid the shipping!!! So far the system is fine. Thank you Amazon for your great customer service.
4,Good for the price,"This system has everything you need for a beginner home theater system. Easy to set up and has a good sound. Not to crazy about the remote, to many buttons a little confusing."
4,Good bang for your buck,"Good buy for $400.00 plus bucks. Eassssssssssy set up,more than adequate sound for TV viewing. Happy with my purchase overall. Dont buy it for listening to just music, wimpy wires! Not for someone that likes LOUD!!"
4,Sony Dream System...great buy!,I really enjoy using this system. The sound is great...and it's really user friendly...cables are all color coded. The only difficulty I have is trying to figure out how to use the speakers while viewing T.V. and how to load more than one CD...havent gotten around to read the user's manual! The system is compact and looks great. Great investment!
4,Well worth the money,"No complaints about this system except what others have already mentioned. The load time for the DVDs could be shorter and the bass is very loud with no way to adjust it. There's only one video out, which is annoying, but not really that big of a deal. Overall, we are very happy with the purchase and the price was awesome. We shopped around a lot and this was the best deal out there."
1,Beware!!!,"Well, I bought this system after Thanksgiving. I really enjoyed the sound over the last year. But recently, the 5CD stocker broke down. The system can't eject DVDs nor can play them... I just can't do anything with it now... and it happened right after the limited 1 yr warranty expired :("
2,tHUMBS dOWN,"If you don't mind a thumping bass with no control and overall poor audio, it's worth about $250. Not the $400 I wasted or the $699 list. I've seen boom boxes with more audio control. The simple and very few presets all have thumping bass which makes it unacceptable for watching TV with 5.1 sound because most of the commercials are overbassed to annoy you. The only way to stop it is to rip the bass wires out because Sony included a cheap bass with no volume control unlike any $50 set of pc speakers. The dvd HDMI upscaling is pretty good but is very hard to change modes. There's no onscreen menus for the 5 dvd changer unlike my $89 dvd recorder. This means you have to load on at a time blindly and it takes a full minute to load each disk. Not a bad system overall but Sony has chosen not to give you any control over it except for very few choices they have locked into it."
5,I wish I could get it for my Kindle,There are some books I can read over and over. This is one of them. It was excellent the first time I read it and every single time after. I wish I could get it for my Kindle because it would be worth the download to have to read once a year.
2,"Dull, repetitive and uninspiring","I bought this album having heard an excerpt from track 11 (Baglama) which starts off with a very exciting middle-eastern sounding introduction but soon tapers off. Unfortunately, this was the most interesting track on the album and the rest of it is a simplistic, over-produced set of variations on some very dull themes. Although there are some interesting ideas the music lacks any real development and is ultimately unsatisfying."
5,heart lifting and soul freeing,"My son Sebastien and I love this CD. This is absolutely a music for reunion, joy, dream, and free spirits."
2,Only for Catherine Bell,"Overall this video is nothing special, just standard late night cable skin. But if you are a fan of Catherine bell this is a 4 star video.Catherine's acting is good and she has a very nice nude scene in this video. Really this video is only for the Catherine Bell fan. Also Tanya Roberts is only in it for about 5 minutes and doesn't really have anything to do with the stories."
2,Watch it on stolen cable instead,"This is your standard Skinemax fare. I bought it entirely for reason, namely, Catherine Bell, and for said purpose the vid is good-but-not-great. Still, beggars can't be choosers. In fact this softcore is a little tame in general, even moreso than other York Video releases. As someone who is, ah, familiar with the genre, I can imagine that the other Hot Line episodes are at about the same level. All these series follow the same basic formula, though others cross more boundaries. By the way, Tanya Roberts is only the peripheral ""narrator"" type, not the star participant as the advertising implies."
1,Too Faced Lip Injection Extreme,The real sham!! Save you money!! Nothing but slick goo on the lips. NO PLUMPING!!
4,bright!,"This light will make your room 5x brighter than it was before. If you are going for subtle lighting, this is not your fixture. The bulbs are halogens, and so are a little expensive ($20+ for 3), and are not provided with the item."
4,Growing up with Tom Bodett,"As 'coming of age' stories go, I consider Stephen King's ""The Body""/""Stand By Me"" the gold standard. Norman Tuttle is short of that standard. Still, it is a very worthwhile read. As a 57-year-old adult, I identified with most of the anecdotes that Mr. Bodett included in this fast-paced read. I am certain, without a doubt, that young readers will enjoy this book as well. Young or old, you will enjoy this book. Like ""The Body,"" Norman Tuttle would make an excellent film that would draw a wide range of viewers."
2,NOT a CD,"Technically, this is not a CD. Philips has set standards for what a CD is, and since this contains copy protection, it does not conform to those standards. The product does have a warning and does not bear the CD logo which is as it should be since it doesn't conform. However, the amazon listing is not clear on this point.I give it 2 stars instead of 1, since the music is good. However, especially if you listen to CD's on Linux, you may have your work cut out for you in defeating the copy protection in order to listen to the songs. And Americans so doing could be in violation of the DMCA, not sure, IANAL."
2,Doesn't seem to know the characters,"I've read all the Buffy novels, and this author doesn't have a grasp of the characters. The dialogue rings false, and basically the actions and words of the very familiar characters seem forced, which becomes very distracting. Therefore, I wasn't able to stay too interested in the plot, so I don't have much of an opinion on it. This is only the second Buffy novel I didn't finish in one sitting, the other being ""Visitors."""
3,Unique,"Overall this book was okay. Why? It had a unique plot I guess with the whole mythology thing. (I'm into mythology.) But the villains were a little cliched. If you haven't read the rest of the Buffy books out there you probably don't know what I am talking about. Anyway in at least three three other Buffy novels the bad guys are demons/goddesses who convientally become new teachers/staff at Sunnydale High and Giles ends up falling victim to them. Other than that the book was okay, I did find that the ending was a little confusing-but mostly I liked it. 3 and half stars."
5,A Fun Read,"I'm new to Massie's work, but have enjoyed everything I've read of hers so far. I don't know much about Buffy but checked this out and found it a fun and creepy story. It was interesting to the end. I would recommend it for people who are Buffy fans and even those, like me, who haven't spent much time in Sunnydale."
3,Giles In the Basement?,"Whenever I read a Buffy novel, I highly anticipate the variations including the author's nuances, certain character flaws and some inconsistances. Willow and Xander should never be treated like minor characters. These characters were woefully under utilizied. Oz, Giles and Cordelia are featured. Cordelia is annoying and extremely vapid, like Season One Cordy, but she matured (somewhat) by Season Three.If you can't kill an immortal by splitting their head in two, how can they drown or suffer a mortal wound by a knife in the back? Massie didn't think that through. Massie did depict Buffy's character accurately and she alluded to how Buffy felt before she became the slayer. Her skin was really sensitive and she had strange reactions to different people.If you are new to the Buffy novels, pick another novel to begin with. This is strictly for the die-hard fans."
3,Hmmmm,This whole book seemed like one big fan-fic. The author totally captured all the characters except Buffy. IT also seems kinda childish for some reason. I still haven't figured out when the book took place but other than that the story is okay.
3,Okay. Not great in the least...,"The characters were all out of character (even when they were under the 'influence'). Oz talked too much. Come on authors, short responses, doesn't talk much, lacking in exclamation marks. Oz isn't that hard of a character to get down. I'm writing a Buffy novel at this time, and I find Oz to be the easiest character to pinpoint. (Giles is the hardest because of his depth) Also, Cordelia does NOT hang out with the slayerettes. Even in the third season (this is the point the book took place) she totally ignored Buffy and her friends. Come on, when have you ever seen Cordy come running to Buffy practically shreiking for assistance in her problems? Can you say never? Not to mention Massie ended every sentence Cordelia said with much. Can you believe that much? Rude much? I don't think so much? So very not cool much? Poor writing much? 'Nuf said..."
4,The Best Game Ever!,"It's just the best game I've ever played! It features nice 2D/3D Graphics, RPG , action + adventure. A must have!"
4,The Kobayashi Report,Overall I think this is a pretty fun game for something on the system. Though at some point it is impossible to go on because of the card key. But at this time there might be some guide for that hidden item. But it is still quite fun.
2,prepare for disappointment,"This game could have been a lot worse, but is definitely not a first reccomendation. For one thing the first-person view indoors is not very good, but that is not the worst part, because the gameplay is not bad. The biggest disappointment with the game is that you spend hours beating it, doing all the objectives in order, and you get the worst, most disappointing ending in video game history. A black screen that simply says ""you have escaped from jurassic park"" Gee, thanks feelas, we didnt know thats what it meant when we got in the helicopter and flew away."
1,came broke,the game came in and had another persons name in white out on it and didnt even work. waist of my cash.
2,Bad watch,"I thought the color of the watch was too bright, the face too fat the strap to clunky - I had to return mine."
3,perfect victim,"I am a childhood friend of the victim, rachel barber. Its taken me 10 years to pick up her mothers book and read the sickening details of her murder & the intimate details of how the family coped. The author gives such a compelling story that there is a movie being released based on this book titled 'in her skin'.I rate this book three stars out of five as i found there to be too much repetition on some information and not enough of the information i wanted."
2,plenty of cusion but the leather is very hard,"I have Rockport for more than 10 years but this pair is different, the leather is very hard and it rubs so hard against my ankles they become red and sensitive. There is plenty of cusion at the bottom of the shoes though. Hope Rockport will improve its quality to what it had before and in the mean time, I am sticking with my old shoes."
5,Love them,"I have back and knee injuries and these help to decrease my pain when walking, they fit very well and are comfortable."
1,Shipping errors,"I never received this item. I was shipped the wrong pair of shoes three times, before asked for refund. The shoes were received in box with label and picture of correct shoes but contents were different. Talked to several representative and asked that they at least open the box to insure proper item. All talk no results."
2,Humm...true?,"I was looking for a book that got into the heart and soul of New Mexico and discovered America, New Mexico at my local bookstore. It had a great title, a great cover, a writer who could write...and unfortunetly enough new age retoric that at one point I wanted to send the book back to the University of Arizona and ask why tax dollars were being spent on such endevours. So read at your own risk. At one point the author claims that the only reason Europe developed instead of Native Americans in North America was that gunpowder had accidently made its way to Europe first. Humm. Want a good book about the heart and soul of New Mexico try the Toby Smith's ""Stay Awhile."""
4,Literally Believement,"These are brilliant books that my cousin introduced me to in high school.I loved it then, it introduced me to fun for the fun of it with a mad literary bent.Later, in college, I read Ulysses and that filled in the circle.From pure imagination to pure recognition flowing together in a single purpose; To say what the hell is going on here????I got this book to introduce my sons to the joy of confusion, and while the books do not seem quite as crazy as they seemed back then, it's still a brilliant cracking of normalcy and a sad reminder of the great loss of imagination silenced.Be Here Now"
1,Buyer Beware,"This book is the quality of a black and white photocopy. The main reason I wanted a hardback copy of this book was to have nice prints of the Maxfield Parish illustrations. They appear HERE as tiny, low res, too dark, black and white. The print on demand nature of this book coupled with the high price leaves me feeling hoodwinked. Beware the comments from other readers --- they mention the wonderful full color illustrations from the out of print versions --- THIS BIBLIOBAZAAR, LLC VERSION DOES NOT HAVE COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS. Save your money --- keep looking."
2,Hated it,This product was sooo annoying. I had trouble using the phone with this product attached.It was always in the way & it broke after 2 months.
3,Good and bad,"I really loved this product when I bought it, but it broke the next day and I can't find the pieces."
1,Disapointed,"I purchased this book in hope off adding information and knowledge to my own genealogical research. The book was too narrow and offered no additional informantion helpful to me. I felt the line, although accurate, was not detailed enough to use as a building block twards other works. The information contained in this book could have easily been obtained in about 15 minutes on the internet. I really did not need to know about the author's current family or see any pictures of himself or offspring(Which there are Many). I feel the title was misleading and I was looking for a book more directed towards History rather than present. ... I supposed I would not be as disapointed if the price was say half of what I paid for it."
4,Good topic - misleading title,"The approach of linking the great French (and subsequently English) family of Plantagenet of the early modern world to their contemporary American descendants, is a good one. Perhaps more space might have been devoted to contemporary Plantagenet family members in the direct male line as these do exist today (despite the best efforts of Henry VIII, scion of the dancing wardrobe master Owen Tudor). The Beaufort family of England or the de Warren family of France are conspicuous examples. It should also be noted that William the Conquerer was in no shape or form a Plantagenet. On the contrary, the Dukes of Normandy and the Counts of Anjou were traditional enemies and entirely distinct in origin."
4,A new ending,"This book is a kind of a third ending of the Champion saga (the first two ones were The Quest for Tanelorn and Dragon in the Sword), with Erekose appearing again (although playing a very small part in the story, but without it, the novel wouldn't correspond to the whole Saga). Also this book lets us know something about the pre-history of John Daker, and the pre-history of his wife. I think it may be recommended to the readers who don't like the 3rd John Daker novel (i.e., Dragon in the Sword), because it differs from that one very much, portraying quite another Mr. Daker to us.The book is written not in the usual Moorcock manner, it has a much simpler language, so if you have been sometimes embarrassed by Moorcock's style (those long words of Latin origin which are not easy to understand), this book may seem easier to read for you. As for me, I'm longing for the good old manner in which the classical Elric stories have been written."
3,"ok, but not as good as his other works","I liken this much more to the ""chronicles of narnia"" style and not at all what I expected of mm. I really enjoy most of his eternal hero books and in particular his Elric ones that have a dark, almost anti-hero aspect to them. This is not that, it has things like talking houses and talking foxes in it. This does not make it bad, just not what you would expect from Moorcock"
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to the ""last Elric novel"" and hoped that Elric would play a larger role in this book than in the two previous ones in the loosely connected trilogy that began with The Dreamthief's Daughter and continued in The Skrayling Tree. But this novel is downright boring. Much of the text describes the random thoughts of a twelve-year-old girl who is the chief character in the book (despite what the title might lead you to believe, the ""White Wolf's Son"" plays a very minor role), her various kidnappings and periods of captivity, or the numerous cast of supporting multiverse characters who pop in and out of the book. The multiversal muddle with its numerous versions of the same city wears thin quickly, as its involves lengthy explanations about the moonbeam roads, the relative nature of time, etc."
4,Great series if you can stand the odd footnotes,"I loved the first book in this series, The Earth Will Shake. In this book, The Widow's Son, Wilson's eccentricities creep in and the reader is bombarded with crazy footnotes that offer historical insights, personal comments, and suppositions about which historical figures and writers were in an `altered state' (that is, smoking dope). Wilson's drug induced paranoia isn't quite as annoying as Hunter S. Thompson, but it does get to be a bit much and detracts from the narrative.Still, the writing is competent and the conspiracy is more plausible than the fluffy Dan Brown novels. This book is far better than Dan Brown but not as competent as Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum.**Here's an example of the kind of footnote you'll see in the `Widow's Son.' Wilson has long been skeptical of the modern skeptic movement. He has attacked skeptical icons like the Amazing Randi for his closed mindedness because Randi debunks paranormal and psychic phenomenon. Peace!"
1,to stretch for something is to surrender to it's whim,"can i give it a ""0""? this sheaf of papyrus that this book is printed on is not worth the pancakes sent from sirius. we must progress to the days of nazi germany in order to burn this book to the ground. his other books are OK, though."
5,Just what I ordered!,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas, true to size and the color was just what I wanted, my husband really likes it!"
2,You get what you paid for,"I got this shirt for my husband because it seemed pretty cheap. I guess you get what you paid for. The material of this shirt was very ROUGH, he did not like it at all. Also the shirt is not true to size (I think!). The medium seem so big, I even took that shirt and measured it against other medium shirts that my husband has and it still seemed pretty big (by big- I mean wide). He is skinny so that might have affected a little bit, but I still I do no think it is completely true to size. I do not recommend this product. Don't let the price catch you! I rather pay $10 more and get a decent shirt made with a soft material."
3,It's OK,"Decent enough shirt, but definately not the most comfortable shirt I've owned. The size could be a little bigger for XL, but pretty good fit."
2,It's HUGE!,"I don't know why, but these shirts are not sized according to normal standards. My husband wears a large in all of his shirts so I ordered a large in this one. I also got a large pique polo in another brand. This shirt is SO MUCH BIGGER than the other one. It looks like it's probably actually a 2XL at least."
3,Not what i expected..,I really expected a softer fabric.. i dont feel quite good here ..i expected a lot more from Hanes. I've been a Hanes user and i thought this one would be as good as the other Hanes Sportshirt i've got. Look for another hanes model if you want a softer sportshirt...
4,Not the softest material.,"This shirt works just great for what it needs to be - an office-casual work polo. However, the material (while 100% cotton) is a little less soft than other polos I am used to. But for under ten bucks, I can't complain."
2,Too Short,"This shirt was too short for my husband. He has a long back but doesnt usually need a ""tall"". A true to size XL will normally do the trick but not this time."
3,cotton polo standard issues,"I was looking for burnt orange polo with an even bottom that wasn't too expensive. I found it. However, my options were very limited but this one wasn't expensive so I figured I could gamble. It's an ok polo, but like all 100% cotton polos there will be issues. The collar tends to roll a bit. The seams of the sleeves(inside) are a bit too noticeable (but not irritating to the skin) even though I wear an undershirt. Will shrink a bit, as expected but the sizing is very accurate afterward. For the price it's a decent all cotton polo."
5,Thanks Friend,The smiles and good feelings this gave me in the bookstore at 8:30 at nite after a long day made my evening. You have to have a good friend to love it and then you realize how fortunate you are! It is easy reading and wonderful.
4,Cool game,"Having enjoyed the original Rockman series (at least, 1-7), I decided to try the Mega Man X game recently, though I had been aware of MMX for years. This game is different than the original, but it has enough features in common with its predecessor that it is familiar and fun enough for longtime fans.Rather than '----' Man as the usual stage boss, the Robot Masters in the MMX series are generally modeled after animals but with many of the same abilities as the original bosses, such as lightning, fire, ice, shield, etc. Here you have such Bosses (referred to as Mavericks) as Chill Penguin, Flame Mammoth, Sting Chameleon, Launch Octopus and so on and so forth, the formula of which would last through the rest of the MMX series. You acquire weapons, and by exploring stages carefully, you can increase your Power Gauge and find other nifty little things that boost your stats.I have to admit that I miss Dr. Wily, he was such a fun game character, but this series is still a lot of fun."
2,Bad clams!,"Adequate for office use. DO NOT buy one to scan film.Mine works OK to scan prints up to 8x12 or documents. The film/slide scanning attachments or software did not work from the first time I tried it. Unfortunately I found this out a few days out of warranty. It's absolutely useless.DO NOT buy one to scan 11x17 because, unlike our friend ""Joe"" says, the glass is only 8.8"" x 14"" Use a ruler much, Joe?I'm running XP pro 800mhz w/2 gig ram."
1,Poor installation instructions,Both the written instuctions and the onscreen instructions were very poor. The installation was much more difficult than it should have been.
4,Great Product - Questionable Seller,I ordered one product and was sent AND charged for two. NO RETURN Policy seller. Now I am trying to sell the extra copy.
4,office 2007,"It is much easier to navigate than 2003 and the Ribbon is excellent. The ohter features speed up the process in Word, Excell and Powerpoint.Way to go Bill Gates"
4,A Great Segway to Office 2010,"This upgrade provided a nice transition for my journey from Office 2003 to 2010. The majority of the user interface changes occurred from 2003 to 20007 and as I would later experience it softened the learning curve to Office 2010. While I still struggle with the new U/I at times, having made the interim step helped quite a bit. For a first-time user the U/I is probably more intuitive and user friendly but for a long time user of MS Office there was a whole lot of unlearning and habit breaking that needed to be done…sometimes I question why but to make a better product you must keep moving forward."
5,MS2007 Office Small Business Upgrade,It was all we expected and more. Simple to install over MS2003 Office Student Edition. We would highly recommend it.
4,Several good improvements over the older version!,There were several improvements over the old version I had and It works well with Adobe pdf download exporter! I am enjoying it very much!
4,Very Good,This version of Microsoft is awesome it is just my wife needed for her College courses she is taking online. Thanks again for your awesome site in which to look and buy from.
4,A good upgrade,This is definitely a step up from my Office 2003 software and quite honestly I prefer it to the 2010 version. File sizes are small and load time is quick. Of course all the features that you expect from MS Office are there and it works without hogging too many resources. Also fewer crashes than its predecessor.
2,Small Biz 2007 not that good,I am a little disappointed in the upgrade to Microsoft Office as it is not user friendly nor is it as accommodating as the earlier version.
2,Microsoft Office Small Business 2007 Upgrade,"My installation of Microsoft Office Small Business 2007 Upgrade has not yet succeeded for Outlook without which my purchase is worthless (other systems installed satisfactorily). The system is in Florida where I will return later this week, and I will have our company IT expert attempt to enable Outlook to work via Team Viewer. If he succeeds, then I'll become satisfied; if he fails, I'll be contacting Microsoft for another remedy.John P. Kyle"
2,Microsoft Office Business 2007,"It is ok but isn't really any better than the 2003 version. Just something to spend your money on without giving the average user any real benefits. A new face and a relearning curve. Like most of Microsofts products. If you have to buy it, Amazon is the cheapest place to buy a ligitimate version. Be careful of the products for sale on ebay. Most are illegal versions. I got taken for $128.00 on ebay for a pirated version."
3,Office Small Business 2007 Upgrade,"Have mixed feelings about Office 2007. 2002 was much more user friendly. Plus some bugs occured with Outlook express not recognizing my email password, (STILL EXISTS) also had to reload the program because of some issues with ExcelIt is an intense program and almost requires re-learning the Office program all over again."
1,UPGRADE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VISTA,"PRODUCT RETURNED! Amazon shipped this product in a secure plastic container, like the one used in retail stores. You risk damaging the software and injury to yourself when opening. A sign of things to come? This product is NOT compatible our new HP Laptop w/Vista,specifically, Outlook. After an hour of entering 10 business email addresses and downloading into Outlook, the software worked okay until next laptop reboot. Outlook data could not be accessed. Problem has to do with PST files. Google it. See the number of complaints and fixes that don't work. Waste hours searching to trying to resolve the issues. In addition, installing this software created numerous other Vista issues that we finally had to do a system recovery."
3,Wish I stayed with 2003,"Once this product was installed, the updates to the layout and everything are pretty nice. Honestly though, it was the most trouble filled upgrade I have ever done. DLL errors, the fact that every time I would start Outlook it kept trying to re-install Outlook 2003, one problem after another. And that's not even counting the problems that slammed everything to a halt when I tried to install Small Business Manager. Its a good product, but honestly, its 2010 and Microsoft could not get an install figured out from 2007? And this was not just on one computer, but every one that we upgraded. Of course once our IT guy spent the time researching the fixes from various message boards, he did manage to know what to do and we seem to be running fine now. So all said and done, its a good product, but I don't know if it was worth the headaches."
2,Doesn't do what I needed,"I purchased three copies of Small business and was very disappointed to discover that unless we are all in the same office and use a common server there is virtually no way to share information.I have one salesperson but expect to add more in other parts of the country.I have no way to track the contacts they make using this program.Also, we discovered that it is unstable using Vista.Thought that this would be a cheaper option than ACT or SUARDO - wrong."
2,Not my favorite program.,"I tried the Beta version of Office 2007 and was unable to erase it and get my original Office 2003 to work. After much frustration with tech support, etc. I purchased the new super duper Office 2007.I find it more cumbersome, less user friendly, and inferior to Office 2003 in almost every aspect. Even after one year of use, I am continually having to look up information in the ""help"" section to try to do simple tasks.I am a writer and also own a translating company. I enjoyed the simplicity of 2003 and only have this program, because the Beta version of 2007 would not allow me to go back to 2003.CSP"
2,Didn't do what I expected,"I was excited about using the Business Contact Manager with Accounting Express to better manage my small business. But in the end I could never get the two products to work together reliably. I seemed to keep having data base issues. And in spite of frequently backing up my work, I was usually unable to recover from those backups (""Backup not compatable with this version"").Also in spite of having a brand new HP computer with 6GB of memory, the software really seemed to tax the system. After entering multiple financial transactions, there were loooong delays before any other programs would respond. I eventually gave up on the accounting software and went back to using Excel. The Business Contact Manager works well by itself."
1,"Worst upgrade ever, stay away","Sorry Microsoft, but your ""ribbon"" user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever. It renders all your Office applications useless. I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again (I'm not even sure if it's even possible to customize the ""ribbon""). The ribbon is ugly and WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY too big.My advice: try to avoid upgrading for as long as possible."
1,Office 2007,"If you are starting fresh and have never really used the more advanced functions of MS Office, the upgrade probably won't affect you. However, the more knowledgeable and proficient you ""were"" with MS Office the more painful this upgrade will be. As for me I'm switching back to my pirated version. Microsoft feels the need to re-invent the wheel on an already refined product merely to have something new to sale. I guess they figure compatibility (or lack thereof) issues will force users into switching. Whoever was in charge of the development team at MS should be fired because they suck."
1,This alternator is a piece of junk!!,"I order from the seller, alternator lasted 6 weeks, seller does not want to exchange, amazon does not care, everywhere else you get lifetime warranty, buying from amazon and the seller is costing more money.BEWARE--DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,"
5,Excellent Detail and Insight!,"Few works have the depth of detail and insight to shed light onto the explosive and painful relationship between the Israel and the Palestinians. Simon Reeve has accomplished what is usually impossible through research and interviews that are both disturbing and profound. By including Germany's role in the massacre, as well as Israel's response, the terrorist incident in Munich takes on an imporant world view. This is a must read!"
4,One Day in September,This was a very interesting book and a nice read. This was a story I had been interested in learning more about and this book did not disappoint. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about this tragedy.
5,Very Good Book!,This book provided excellent coverage of the killing of the Israeli olympic athletes in the 1972 olympics. There were someexcellent inside interviews with people who were actually involved in the situation. The mistakes by the German police were also well documented. The Black September terrorists alsowere well describer by Reeve. The book was further strenghtenedby the inside dealings of the Israeli government in the planningof the vengance mission.Israel reacted very professionally tothe killings of it's athletes. This is a very good history book.It is well written and makes for good reading.You will not bedissapointed.
1,"Excellent Media, Terrible Media","Great music. The comments here and on NPR helped lead me to this great disk. It was very difficult to play my copy. Like most people, I have more then one device to play a CD in. This CD does not work in most of them."
3,"More dolls, less therapy...","An interesting dvd which does show dolls and the incredible artists who create them. However, I too agree that the title is misleading; this is more about the doll makers and how a lot of them in this documentary, use doll making as therapy to get over the death of their loved ones.While it makes for an interesting story, it also detracts.The works of Lisa Lichtenfels and E.J. Taylor is worth the price of the dvd alone."
5,This is a really great game/ and it gets better!,This is a game that not only gets better as the levels go on but it also gets harder. At one point my son and I decided that we would have to go and hunt down the player's guide. Wow! What a difference that made. There are levels of play that I am sure we would still be fighting to get through if not for this. We had a little trouble finding the guide so go to your used video game stores or order it directly at nintendo.com. Anyway get this game and get the guide and you won't come out of your house or get any sleep for quite awhile!!
3,Could of made it better,"I think they could of made this way better. I definitly like the other two better. I think the game itself is fine, but it gets rather dull. You have to collect all the gold coins; every single one!! Boring!! But It is not as bad as some..."
3,Adventures in babysitting?,"There's nothing technically wrong with DKC3:DK'sDT. I mean, it's a great platformer, but it has a tendancy to seem more like a chore than actual fun. Dixie Kong returns front-and-center from her co-starring role in Diddy's Kong Quest, and nothing's changed about her. That's good news because she can still whack enemies with her hair and glide like a helicopter. That's bad news because she can't take-out some bigger enemies, so she needs the help of her overweight brat, Kiddy Kong."
2,Not as good as I thought,"They should've made this game like the 2 before it. They just made it too complex and un donkey kong ya know what i mean?Its ok at first, but it gets boring too fast.( at least it's not nearly as bad as DK64 )"
2,Barely works,"Game barely works, has to be fiddled with. Doesn't even save sometimes. I was disappointing to say the very least."
2,[...],I bought this camera 1 week ago. Although it is cute and compact however I had problems taking pics with it. [...] Hello my red Sony 7.1 mp. The only reason I rated it a 2 is because it is compact cute and colorful.
5,Many features in an Ultra small unit,"I bought EX-S500 and although I didn't get such a good deal on the price, I held on to it because it is extreemly versatile. Mpeg 4 quality videos and a Lithium Hydride battery which under a full charge yields almost limitless power. I used it for three days, took 65 videos + 255 photos and it still had 3/4 power left. CCD image quality is excellent."
5,Nice small and does video (mpeg4 avi),"This small thin camera does mpeg4 avi video at 640x480 at 30 frames per second.The key being 30 fps , a lot of cameras only do 15 ...So your not only taking a camera with you on a trip your also carrying a video camera too! Granted its not miniDV quality but still great.It will play back video on a mac by downloading the quicktime casio avi importer.1gb sd card will do over 30 minutes of high quality video that can go straight to your computer for editing or whatever , not bad for the price !"
3,+ and -,"PROS: great video quality, super small size, quick start up timeCONS: horrible image qualitythe image quality on this camera is BAD. very noisy pictures, expecially in low-light or no-flash situations. takes decent pictures outdoor in lots of light, but everything else...unacceptable. the video mode works really well though"
1,"sensitive screen, be careful","I believe this to be a very good camera, it excedes all expectations except: the screen.This camera has a lot of cool functions but it also needs to have the best care in the world. Just two weeks after I bought the camera, the screen got busted because it is too sensitive and don't think I didn't care for the camera because you are wrong, I took real good care of it, I even got it a hard case but I guess it wasn't good enough.with the exception of the screen being too sensitive, I would rate the camer with a little more than 5 stars but seeing as how I can't review my pictures because I have NO screen and, also, I can't use any of the ""cool"" functions because there is absolutely no way for me to see the menu(again NO screen)I would now rate it with a star-at the most."
1,"Rick B. Elezi ""rickgurri.. I agree with you",I used this camera for a week before I encountered the problem with the lens. I sent the camera to NJ repair center. They refused to honor the warranty claiming that I bought it from an unauthorized dealer and wanted $200 for repair. I threw this camera away and will never buy Casio product again.
5,Great camera,"Great camera, takes quick pictures with ease. Contrary to professional reviews this is one of the best ultra-compact cameras on the market."
1,Do not buy this camera!,"I had this camera for five weeks when the silver ring around the lens popped off. I called Casio and they instructed me to send it to their repair center in New Jersey. I received an invoice from Casio stating it will cost me $170 to fix. After speaking with several representatives and leaving voicemail messages for management, I have not been able to resolve this problem. The repair center said my lens is broken (the lens is working fine - it's the ring around the lens that fell off) and the warranty does not cover lens and screen repairs. The warranty states the product is covered, except for the case and battery, for one year. Terrible product, even worse customer service. I will NEVER buy another Casio product."
3,"Good for Outdoors, Lousy for Indoors","Overall, this has been a decent camera for me. It takes great outdoor pictures, and even though I've dropped it several times, it has never broken.My main complaint for this camera is that when it takes a picture indoors, everyone's faces come out extremely shiny. I'm talking about people glowing- and not in a good way.I'm not a camera expert, but none of my other friends who have basic digital cameras have this problem. I guess if you rarely take pictures of people inside then this would be a good camera, but I would not recommend it for indoor use."
4,i love my camera :),"ive had this camera for around 3 years already! i got it as a present for christmas. the strap and one of the screws has popped out recently but it still works just fine. my sister has an even more expensive canon camera, but it cant even take pictures w/o flash w/o blurring but i find that the casio does it just fine. i love all the features on it, especially the different themes for video taking. the flash is really bright too."
2,5 stars for camera - zero stars for service,"I loved the size and quality better than expected given it's compactness, but if you have to send it for warranty repair get ready to pay. The optical zoom broke after opening in my front pocket. I sent it back to Casio and they said it wasn't under warranty because there was a slight 'blemish' on the other side of the case - which voids the warranty. Probably a scratch from a quarter or something in my pocket. I called and wrote letters to no avail. If you are able to fix cameras yourself, go for it, otherwise go with a company with better customer service."
5,Casio Exilim EX-S500 is GREAT!,"This camera is extremely easy to understand and use and it takes wonderful quality pictures. Only a basic knowledge of photography is needed to operate the camera, but the features are there for those who want a more in-depth camera. I highly recommend this item."
5,Casio Exilim EX-S500 5MP Digital Camera.,What a great little camera. I can keep in right in my purse so I have it with me all the time. I never have to say I forgot my camera again. Takes great pictures too.
4,Better Than Most of What's Out There Right Now,"You should also hear Joe's amazing backing (for now) vocalist, Sharyn Murray. She really adds a lot to the Rathbone Band's already impressive palette. I hear that Sharyn will be featured quite a bit on Joe's new CD. I can't wait."
2,--really not that great--,"Joe Rathbone is a decent songwriter with a so-so voice. It's really vocalist & percussionist, Sharyn Murray, who gives him his edge in concert, and fills out his sound, and provides the personality and humour of his act. He should do himself a favor and feature Ms. Murray on his next project. Wait for the next CD.Hopefully, on that CD, his songs won't sound the same."
3,A nice first stab.,"With a little money and production behind him, I can definitely see Rathbone moving into the Freedy Johnston/Matthew Sweet level of record making. He has a pleasant voice, a keen wit, and his songs are well-written. From what I hear, his next release is definitely going to be *the* one to look out for. Can't wait."
5,Sweet Relief Is the Best Relief,"In the tradition of great lyricists (like Bruce Springsteen), Joe Rathbone can pen some great lines. No trite sentiments or amateurish rhymes run throughout his work. There's nothing predictable on the musical front either. Sound and sense come togther in compelling, knock-out ways. This is a debut effort, but, debut or not, it's a great effort. Catch him and his band--if you can--in the NY-NJ-PA-DE area.P.S. Hey, when you gonna start playing in DC?"
2,--really not that great--,"Joe Rathbone is a decent songwriter with a so-so voice.

2,Addams Family Values,"This below-average video game is nearly impossible to complete, and it's not very involving or intense either. In this video game sequel to the better first part, Baby Pubert has disappeared and now Uncle Fester must find him and return him to Gomez and Morticia. ""Addams Family Values"" has really nothing to show off, except that some of the graphics are pretty good for its time."
1,WOOOO,"You have money, Fitty? Really? Is that so? Let's hear about it for every second of everything you record! What's that? It's a deal!? MY PRAYERS ARE ANSWERED!"
5,Anatomically correct!,These tigers are very adorable if you're just looking for something to put up for display. They're also great for kids if they like to play 'jungle' or some such game.The only criticism I have is that they are anatomically correct...and they are most definitely male! LOL!
5,great bargain and book,this was my 1st book I read on my kindle. I was greatly pleased. A heart warming story between a dog and a man. easy to read and short but was very well written. Great bargain as it was free.
4,cranberry delight,I did some shopping arond on the internet looking for the best deal on cranberry juice concentrate. I had purchased another brand previously from another siteand wanted to try another label. the Dynamic Cranberry ranks right up there with the best of them. I love adding it to my tea and the health benefits. Will buy again.
2,was not made well,"didn't like it at all , sent it back as it was not made well at all! wish I would have bought a few more of the other oneI I had bought with the same order!"
5,Perfect!,I love this hat! I think it's the perfect stylish yet simple black hat. Very comfortable and looks great with almost everything. Definitely my new go-to hat!
5,Works great!,"This will wear just fine for your paintball games, or if you just want to wear it around town. An excellent, very soft-yet-durable fabric and it machine washes very well. It also retains that Can shape even after I beat the living heck out of it one weekend. The description here on Amazon is very accurate and the vendor delivered it in a very timely fashion. Great stuff!"
1,UGLY SMALL TINY HAT,"This hat is simply ugly. The hat's width and length are tiny which makes it look out of style. If you're looking for an oversized stylish cadet hat, this is definitely not it."
5,Menander's plays and fragments,"I'm a Classical Civilisations student at Leeds University in England and this book is one of many that I have to read for my course. Menander was said to be ""second only to Homer"" and it is clear why this statement was made in this translation by Norma Miller. This book contains all but two of the fragments found of Menander. Old Cantankerous really stands out as a superb piece of literary genius, although this isnt to say that the rest of the book isnt an equally great piece of work. This book contains fragments of Menander's work as this is all that has been found of this magnificent writers accomplishments, if you are interested in classical drama then this book is definetley worth considering."
2,NICE BUT NOT APPLICABLE,"Although the quality of the product is GOOD. The information surrounding which MOTO Q it can be used with was not expounded upon in the description, which made this product for us unusable.Upon reviewing the return policy for these items, it had to be defective or we would incur a restock charge just made it not worth the time nor the effort, the cost to execute all of this would truely surpass the purchase price."
1,Amazon sellers are getting as bad as eBay,"I finally closed my eBay account because I was so sick of crooks who listed items for 99 cents and then made their money on exorbitant shipping and handling charges. (one guy listed a USB flash drive for 99 cents and wanted EIGHTY-FOUR DOLLARS in shipping/handling)This seller is almost as bad. I added five of these $1.99 SD cards to my cart for a total of $9.95, then cancelled the order because the shipping would have been almost thirty bucks.Needless to say, this is ridiculous. I can ship five SD cards anywhere in the country for less than ten bucks. Why is Blue Proton charging thirty?This is just another way for unethical sellers to try to rip people off and make them think they're getting a good deal when they're really not."
3,No American Warrranty,"Item doesn't include the standard American lifetime warranty that Kingston products usually come with. I can't read the ""Taiwanese"" that this product ships with...maybe there's a Taiwan warranty. You're better off spending a bit more and receiving an item that's guarranteed for life. It's not uncommon for a file to become corrupted and the card rendered useless."
2,*** Seeds are no where near 200 QTY !!!!,"The item is no were near 200 seeds. Using standard planting directions, they simple do not grow well (in-door during germination). Definitely would not recommend to any buyer."
5,A Well Done History Of Outboard Racing,"As a former outboard racer, APBA Stock and NOA Am Pro and Pro, I found this book to be very well done. Mr. Hunn did his homework. Based on my experiences, I could add a few things but overall a great work.The book was a real memory maker for me. I worked for Hubbell Motors and raced in California and Michigan from 1956 until 1969 and won one national championship in B Alky Hydro at Sanford Michigan in 1966. If you love racing outboards, you will love this book."
5,I'ts a Christian thing.,"Love the man , his example and this movie. This culture and way of life has always been under attack from without and within. I think the flags on the moon are a testimony to the christian nation we once were. These people who loved the Lord were the core of the 1000 year leap."
5,A Must Watch !!!,I don't really have the words to say but it is God moving movie. I recommend this for all to watch .. AWESOME !!!
1,Uninspriring,"I don't know much about Billy Graham to be honest, I was just looking for a good Christ-centered movie. But this is not that. Mostly about men and not at all about God."
5,FINALLY!,"I saw this in the theater in October 2008, yes 2008. That's 18 months of waiting for this to come out on DVD and FINALLY it's here! Great movie and I will definitely be buying it!"
1,Needs English Subtitles!,What good is a Spanish subtitle if you only speak English and are hearing impaired! My mother-in-law is sooooo disappointed!
5,Billy: The Early Years of Billy Graham,"This account of Billy Graham's life is very honest (it showed him like he was), moving and convicting. The producers have done a good job portraying him as a human being, like all of us, who yielded to God and allowed Him to use him. Terrific movie!!!"
1,Film Deceiving,"My wife and I optimistically watched this film with the hopes of it being spiritually up lifting. In my opinion the film reflects Christianity in a negative light and more emphasis was given to doubts in Christ than placing faith in Christ. I believe the intent of the film is to place a seed of doubt in the person watching it ""above all else guard your heart because it is the wellspring of life""."
5,DJ from cars,DJ looks just like DJ from the movie Cars. My daughter plays with often and it has handled well and looks great!
1,kind of depressing,"my 4 year old has been telling me she wants to be a ballerina for the past few weeks. my husband picked this book up at the library and it can't go back fast enough. my girls love the book, but I do have a problem with some of the messages it is sending, as true as they may be. the ""so thin, so pretty so tall, she's got it all"" message is disturbing especially passing that message on to a 4 and 2 year old.my only hope is that the mention of bunions and the sore feet and all the other negatives illustrated will actually discourage my dds from wanting to be ballerinas.even aside from the messages, i didn't think the book was particulary well written.i'd suggest looking for a more positive book."
1,Not appropriate,I don't usually write reviews but I had to warn people about this book. I am shocked this book is for kids. Some of the passages are totally inappropriate (see other reviews where they have been quoted). We checked this out at the library and it will be going back ASAP. If you have a young girl that loves to dance this is NOT the ballet book to buy.
4,Baby G review,"I've been very happy with the watch so far, had it several weeks. It's a little complicated to set the alarm, which is the main function I wanted. I read that some people had water resistance issues with it, but I wear mine constantly for all types of chores including washing dishes and the car and have had no leakage problems. The display is a little dark, but usually not a problem. I like the look of it as far as styling. I wear it out in the evenings and I think it's dressy enough. It is much lighter in weight than I expected. Overall, happy."
4,nice ladies sport watch,"watch is cute ...a bit big but still nice for a baby G. Pink color is great, but thought time keeping feature is simple the digital bar on the side serves no real purpose xcept to make the face look busy digitally. A good purchase - BABY G with stainless steel band"
4,Baby-G Pink Metal Bracelet Watch,"I purchased this for my wife from Amazon.com - as she wanted a Baby-G watch with a metal bracelet strap. This product, strangely isn't available in the UK which I think is a bit silly as Casio would make a killing over here with it. It was still as cheap as a normal Baby-G watch in the UK even with import taxes. My wife loves it, knowing that the resin plastic straps discolour over time, and that this one won't. As good as you could possibly expect from Casio's Baby-G Range."
4,Casio Baby G g-ms pink watch,Casio Baby G g-ms pink watchIt is very easy to learn/use all the functions. Adjusting the band took a little cooperation between my husband and me...three hands were needed! I wish it had a stop watch that went for 24 hours. I need to keep track of my actual time on a job...and the stop watch only goes for 60 minutes. I have adapted by using the timer...starting it at 24 hours and then figuring out how much time was used on the job.
2,Not so waterproof after all,"I purchased this watch because of the numerous features it has, it's purported toughness, and the reviews on amazon. Everything was great until a few days ago, when I wore the watch in the shower (supposed to be waterproof to 660 feet). I had worn it in the shower before with no problem, but this time, I noticed a little condensation under the face of the watch - and then it was dead. Very disappointed; it was less than 30 days old so at least I can get a refund. It was a really cute watch though - oh well. I'll keep looking around."
2,"Great Watch, Horrible Band","I bought this watch to wear while I worked in a restaurant kitchen. It was easy to read and had great timing features, plus it was waterproof. I loved the watch itslef. I had no problems until three months after I bought it. The pin of the clasp fell out and I lost it. I took it to a jewelers and they could not repair it without the pin. I exchanged it for a new one. The second one took 4 months to break at the clasp (same problem). I found the pin and was able to fix it. Three days later the pin at the watch (different spot) fell out and I lost it. I am hesistant to just replace the band for fear it will fall apart. The watch lived up to expectations but it is worthless because of the band."
4,good metal band,"This watch is my first Casio, before this one I had a Timex, cheapermodel but still did the trick. This watch has a nice metal band, justwhat I wanted and all the features of these sorts of watches, alarm, timer, etc. The back light is pink, I love it. The only downfall keepingit from getting 5 stars is that the links are such a size that putting onemore in makes it too loose and keeping it the size I made it seems just a hair small, oh well. The other thing I was pleasantly surprised by was the size of the watch, I was afaid it might be massive, it's not, it's just right."
2,wanna watch,"Unless you have the perfect wrist size, you will need to have this band adjusted. It is a little heavier than expected"
3,Good value for the price,Love the metal band on a sport watch. Buttons on side are just a bit hard to push. Some may think watch is a little large for a small woman.
4,Baby-G Watch,"Nice detail and construction, obvious good quality.A bit big for a womens watch...you'll have to get use to the weight on your wrist especially if you are petite. Otherwise recommended for nice casual wear and VERY durable use."
3,A little disappointing...,"When I received the watch it was in excellent condition and there were no major problems with this watch. But, it is pretty difficult to read the time even with adequate lighting. Its a decent watch with a decent price, but you may want to consider something else."
2,Too too small,I bought this for my 11 year old son and we use it on my 14 month old son! It is so small!
4,Nice Continuation,"This book does a great job bringing in new Lumley readers into the series without requiring them to know anything about the books that came before it. Unfortunately for avid Lumley readers, it is a slow read. The book spends a little too much time going over past events, and thus doesn't move forward until ""Defilers"". It was for this reason alone that I bumped my rating down to 4 stars."
4,Hurry up with the next one ! please :),"This installment in the Necroscope series is a little on the shallow side compared with Lumley's earlier works, but taken in the grans scheme of things it fits in perfectly. Realy looking forward to the next. Make sure you start at the beginning ! Dont want to miss out on any of the action....."
4,Darn Good ;Great Ending;Give Us More,"I Really Enjoyed Another Foray Into The World Of The Necroscope,Although The Latest Installment Started Slow,It Ended Great. There Are Lot's Of Loose Ends To Be Tied Up Leaving The Fans Eagerly Awaiting The Next Book."
3,Not bad...,"Ive read the entire series of the Necroscope and I was pleased when the series contiued with another Necro, However, it was slow starting and went into tedious detail of past events. Overall it was a great book!"
3,Good read but nothing particularly new,"I've read and enjoyed all the previous books in the Necroscope series and although I did enjoy reading this one, I couldn't help but feel that the whole series is being dragged out a little now. The Bloodwars trilogy should have been the end. Introducing new vampire lords and heroes to an already familiar storyline does not a new book make, nor does spending a good chunk of the book telling the Wampyrhi history, again.Saying that, I enjoyed it in a 'quick easy read' kind of way, and look forward to reading the following books in this trilogy. If you enjoyed the other books, you'll enjoy this one. If you're new to the Necroscope series of books, start from the beginning before getting here."
3,Lumley Return's To Excite The Great Majority!,"Brian Lumley has brought us a new Necroscope for a New Century!Fans of his all know about Harry Keogh and the amazing, but terrible powers he had. Not to mention how exciting his adventures were.Now Lumley is revisiting the Wamphyri threat with both new and old characters. Invaders is book one in his new three book trilogy.The novel has some excellent action in it and the standard amazing Lumley creations. The only problem I saw in it is that it felt very incomplete (obviously since this is a trilogy I suppose), but it would have been nice if this could have stood more on it own other than it did. I came away with a feeling that I had only read a 'set-up' novel for the books to come.Still, it's Lumley! It's Necroscope! It's here!"
4,Hurrah! Another Necroscope book!,"I was delighted to read Lumley's newest addition to the fantasy/horror Necroscope world started with Harry Keogh! I was initially suspicious of a Necroscope book without Harry but Jake and both the new and old characters were intriguing. Having read all of Lumley's books, I always liked the original Necroscope books for their depth and detail. . .something I found lacking somewhat in Necroscope: Invaders. . .like not fully fleshed out (no pun intended). However, I did just order the next in the series because no true Necroscope Lumley fan can ever resist that next book!"
3,Lumley's Invaders Doesn't Measure Up,"While Invaders is a decent read, it's nowhere near the level of previous Necroscope novels. Invaders is more of an introduction to the E-Branch books than a full-fledged novel. Lumley spends over 70 pages relating the vampires' backstories which, while interesting, is in the past and contains no drama or action. As one reviewer mentioned, the vampires' abilities are very familiar.There was very little actual vampire action in the book. The bulk of it deals with E-Branch preparing to engage the vampires and the new protagonist's indoctrination into E-Branch.There is a moderate use of obscenity."
3,Good but not great,"I have been reading the Necroscope series since I was a kid and Brian Lumley's world has been a part of my life for many years. The book in question, Invaders, is a solid work, yet it is lacking a bit in the Vampiric side of things - we get plenty from EBranch and the gang, but really what has always done it for me is hearing things from the Wamphyri perspective, these guys are the vampire lords, they are what makes the Necroscope series what it is. I don't want to hear about Jack and his problems, or the crush on him that a chick has - I want the darkness, the violence and the raw debauchery that is Wamphyri! - so, Mr Lumley, more vampire less spook please!And to those new to the Necroscope series - you have many great books to read before you get to this one..."
2,"Bad Book, but Great Seller","I felt the book did not equal the quality that the seller stated. I informed the seller of my feelings about the book and they promptly refunded my purchase price. The book was a 2 star, but the seller is 5 star."
5,A winner,You can't miss with Deadliest Catch - another great season full of the stuff we all love about the show.
5,Huge Fan,"Been a fan of the show since day one, being a lobstermans wife and having worked on the boat I LOVE this series, and Amazon has the best prices, now I can watch all the shows in case I missed anything when I want, you cant get one season without buying the others, and after awhile you feel as though you know these people, nice to get a glimpse of life on the Bering Sea"
4,Gripping!,"There are two great shows on television right now: DEADLIEST CATCH and WHALE WARS. This DVD set is better and richer in terms of features than WHALE WARS, altough I think CATCH has gotten a bit repetitive. Still, a great, entertaining show!"
1,Inauthentic Product,"This vendor is not selling authentic Sircuit Skin X-trap. I have been using this cleanser for 2 1/2 years and it is the BEST. This vendor shipped a thick soapy substance that looks, feels, and SMELLS completely different. Like dish soap. This product usually has no added chemicals or fragrance and the one that was shipped REEKS."
1,So disappointed,"I was so in love with this product, until they changed the formula. It use to work great on my sensitive skin. This new formula has left my skin red/irritated and the smell is horrible. I do not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin. The thought of have to find another facial cleanser is daunting. <Sigh>"
5,Excellent Flavor,"This is one of my favorite herbal teas, it has a very distinct, but light, flavor and is absolutely wonderful at any point in the day. It taste great by itself, but also tastes great with honey."
1,Shame on people who sell bootlegs,"This is a bootleg cd. If you are lucky, then the seller will actually send you the original pressed (silver) cd. If you are unlucky, then the seller will send you a cdr that cost him/her about $1 to make. There are plenty of places on the internet to get every U2 bootleg every recorded for free. Think u2 torrents dot com.As for the music itself ... it is a pretty good bootleg."
4,Excellent Game Play,The game play on Mario World is one of the best of all time. Comparing graphics on a 16bit console with anything made now is pointless. It is all about game play. You can actually have fun playing this game and that is the whole point of playing video games.There are very few games out today that have the game play of these older SNES titles.
4,Best Mario yet,"As the original pack-in game for the Super Nintendo, this is a worthy successor to the Super Mario series! It expands the Super Mario universe without sacrificing the fun or addicting gameplay. In addition to improved graphics, Mario has new moves including the ability to throw turtles, fly, and ride around on a little green dinosaur named Yoshi (his first appearance in the video game!). The world itself is huge compared to previous Mario games, with a nice variety of settings including Haunted Houses. A battery backup lets you save up to four games. This game should be standard issue for all Super Nintendo owners."
5,Classic SNES game....,Super Mario World is a classic.If you have SNES get this incredible game...It's very underrateed.By Far one of the best SNES games besides Super Metroid...If you have an SNES then get games likeDonkey Kong CountrySuper Mario world 2 Yoshis Island..I think thats the name of the title?..I don't rememeber since it's bin a while since I've played that game...Cold Shadow....Super Metroid...Chester Cheetos adventure...yeah ok..thats not a classic but it's still fun!Well yeah thats it...Go get Super Mario Worl if you have a SNES..Its a great gameLater...
5,fast shipping!,"excellent service, fast shipping! game looks and works perfectly-thank you so much, very happy customer in waveland mississippi :) long live mario luigi and yoshi :)"
4,Cool game,"Well for People who likes Mario i'm sure they will enjoy playing this Super Mario World , its Fantastic game not boring at all .. its one of the best Mario games.."
5,one of the best games ever although i have never owned it,my friend had this game so i decided to give it a try i quickly gotinto it and found it a great deal of fun.
3,"So long ago, so over priced!",Was looking for this Super nes game for an aunt that had a little extra time on her hands.Reminiscing of days passed. I found it rather easliy on Amazon. but do my dismay kinda of expensive.This games are in a great abundace so why the over pricing?Well my aunt enjoyed the game anyways...
5,SuperMario is awesome!,"I used to play this game as a little kid. I guess I'm still a kid at heart, because I still love it. The game was shipped promptly and came in excellent condition. I play to my heart's content!"
5,Super Mario World,"The ultimate 2D, video game adventure has the Super Mario Brothers in Donut Land, traveling through strange forests, deserts, castles and underwater levels, all the while thinking of their goal to save Princess Toadstool from the evil King Bowser. This game, although poor in graphics for today's standards, is the most involving and fun game to play with friends or by yourself. The levels get you going, and when you find a key or discover there is some sort of special place you can visit, you get so excited. The characters are adorable, andthe music is great. After all these years, this video game is still my favourite...and Super Nintendo is the best system!"
5,"EXCELSIOR, OLD WORKHORSE BALLET RE-STAGED AT THE PLACE SAME PLACE WHERE IT WAS PREMIERED.","Interesting to watch old workhorse ballet from the late 19th. century. Lots of dancing mostly old fashioned and a sign of the times when it was produced lavishly at La Scala with 500 dancers, elephants and who knows what else!. This is a simplified complete version of the original ballet and as it goes with re-staging works not seen in over 100 years, hard to imaging can be ever close to the original. It was also premiered at the Marinsky Theater in St Petersburg to also great success no doubt due to its original opulence. felicuam@comcast.net"
1,crap,"these are pretty terrible chisels for the price they cost. they're made in america, which means the steel is too. all around, an inferior product. i read in a review that firmer were good chisels, i should've taken the time to review it further. these are buck bros. home depot $10 a set chisels. beaters. for this money, you can get a decent set, scheffield steel... im in the process of returning these, and buying a set of 4 footprints. id rather have 4 good chisels than 6 crap ones for the same price.Footprint 465 123014 4-Piece Beech Handle Wood Chisel Set 1/4-Inch, 1/2-Inch, 3/4-Inch, 1-Inch"
4,COOL CHISELS,"A good price and quality are the bottom line. At first look, these chisels are great, but until I hone and use them for a while, I won't be sure. I like them so far."
5,Excellent quality and price,"I bought it for a gift to my son, he likes to wear it all the times when he used his mountain bike."
1,Taxi and Limousine Inspector Handbook,"If you are looking for a general book on taxi industry regulation and administration this is not the book. Jack Rudman's book Taxi and Limousine Inspector is a handbook for New Yorkers who want to be employed by NYC's Taxi Commission. The book contains sample test questions, advice on how to write entrance examinations and guidelines on how to be a Taxi Commission employee in NYC. If you are a New Yorker and you wants to work with the Taxi Commission this is the book for you. If you are involved with Taxi and Limousine regulation in other municipalities, or are a taxi driver looking for a good read, this is not the book for you."
4,Good CD with some glaring omissions,"While this CD is terrific, it is by no means an overview of Jennifer Warnes' career to date. Strangely absent is any material from Warnes' best album, ""Famous Blue Raincoat."" Also, her latest CD, ""The Well,"" contains some of her best work to date, and none of it appears here. Still, this CD does contain all four of Warnes' Top-10 hits, as well as some excellent recordings, such as ""Could It Be Love"" and ""Don't Make Me Over.""The CD packaging claims the music here has been digitally remastered, but the songs sound the same as on previous, non-remastered CDs. Still, this is a good CD for casual fans of Warnes' work; however, die-hard fans may want to wait for a more definitive (and remastered) collection, which Warnes will hopefully release some day soon."
1,Mine came pre-broken,Mine was basically useless right out of the box. It could only produce horribly warped images. Customer service was knowledgeable and friendly and the return to the store was trouble-free. It wasn't a terrible experience but I won't buy another.
2,Seen Better,"This scanner is very slow, awkward and noisy. I was happier with another brand but it was outdated for XP."
4,Worked until Windows 7,Great unit BUT!!!!!!I have had this scanner for a few years and it worked great until I got a new computer with Windows 7 and now I can not use it.HP is not updating the drivers for this unit in support of Windows 7. Now I have a 12x18 inch paper weight. Thanks Microshaft and HP.
4,Very nice scanner,"I've owned this scanner for almost two years and has worked perfectly for everything I scan. Never a glitch. Unfortunately I'm now needing one that will scan negatives and slides as well. I wish they were as cheaply priced as this one was. For a first time user, you can't go wrong in buying this little workhorse."
