5,WONDERFUL!,"I loved this book! It was wonderful! It was a bit freaky at the murders, but it was really funny, like the time Pasco dances his cousin up into the air and they just sit there, hanging for hours! Anyone who wants to be intertained should read this book. I started getting into Tamora's books by accident, and I am so glad that I did! This book is a fantastic combanation of wit, humor, and mystery. If you are looking for a book that will keep you up all night, and leave you ready for her next word of art, this book is for you! A must read!"
2,Definitly not worth the time...,"Although the last few chapters of this book were very good, I can't say I liked it over all. It takes a long time for the story to get started and once it is started, it drags on very slowly. It adds many pointless details that make it drag on longer. Also, the main character has almost no personality. She handles situations too calmly for her to be real. Even though you will probably enjoy the end of this book, it isn't worth the time it takes getting there."
4,"Good, but not Ms. Pierce's best...","This book was good, but not great. I agree with the reviewer from Severna Park, MD. This book was good, but it wasnt Tamora Pierce's best book. I liked ""Song of the Lioness"" and ""The Immortals"" better. This was maybe a little better than Circle of Magic, but it isnt her best."
5,The entire Naruto series thus far.,"If you're undecided on purchasing this box set, then let me help. I have seen 239 episodes of Naruto so far, and the series is worth it(aside from some embarrasing filler episodes, but let's not go there.) The story only gets better as the episodes go by. The only thing I want to add is this; since there are already 15+ box sets worth of episodes, you might want to wait for the price to drop a bit, unless you're loaded or pure-blood otaku."
1,Hacked!,Some jerk hacked into my Amazon account and ordered this. I truly hope the jerk in Chicago enjoyed this; maybe he or she could write the review because I have no idea what it's about nor is it something that interests me. I guess the jerk will have to hack another account to see how the season ends.
2,Faulty disk,"I purchased this used boxed set for my daughter for Christmas awhile ago and when she went to watch it one of the DVD's did not work at all! There are no scratches, it just doesn't work. A bit disappointing for a Christmas present."
2,Almost Good,"The outside didnt show up in perfect condition, but that was listed in the desription and i expected that. what I didnt expect was that the second disc in the set did not work at all, on any player or system, this wasn't in the description. Seeing as my favorite episode is on that disc I was very disappointed. My suggestion to future sales, test your product before sending it out."
3,Sugar-Free Gumballs,"These gumballs are colorful, and a nice size to go in a gumball bank Santa brought my daughter for Christmas. I like that they are sugarless, but the reason for the 3 stars is because though they taste sweet at first, the sweetness and flavor only lasts a minute at most. Every sugar-free gum and bubble gum I have ever bought no matter the brand, the sweetness/flavor lasted much longer than regular sugared gums. As soon as one of these gumballs is chewed up you want to spit it out because it no longer tastes good. I just think that for the cost, the gum's flavor could have been developed to last much longer. I must say though that they look very colorful in the gumball machine and looking at them makes you want to chew one."
2,false description,"The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs. This is a lie- when you recieve this product there are only 114 servings in a bag and the serving size is considered 2 gumballs- this is a total of only 228 gumballs. To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description. Hard to write a good review when I feel a little ripped off. When purchasing online all we have to go by are the descriptions - if they are not accurate what can we base our purchase on?"
1,"Technically, yes, this is a gumball","Technically, yes, this is a gumball, but it has the texture of cardboard with sweetener. Texture/consistency fails. Gross maltitol?/sorbital taste."
1,Stale,"The gum balls were expensive and, well, horrible. When you bite them they crumble in your mouth like chalk. Just horrible."
3,Good for dieters,I chew sugar free bubble gum when I am trying to lose weight - keeps me from eating. This loses its flavor pretty quickly but most sugar free gum does. Wish it cost a little less too.
3,Decent,"I like these in that they are not loaded with sugar, so I save them for my little boy, but the taste is not great. They do last a little longer than regular gumballs. Don't purchase these if you are expecting them to have a great taste, but great for kids I'd say so they are not rotting their mouths with sugar loaded gumballs."
1,you are bad,they deleted my neg. reviews and the lie said they changed the product review NOT. u are buying a bag of 96 gum balls not 900... and they will call your home if you leave a neg. review.
3,Gum,I was kicking myself for purchasing this small bag of gum. I only bought it for convenience because I also ordered a gum ball machine. Because of the freight I paid like $15 for a small bag of gum. Go to your local convenience store and save money.
1,"I'm sure the gumballs would be great, if they weren't EXTREMELY STALE! I'll never purchase from this company again.","I'm sure the gumballs would be great, if they weren't EXTREMELY STALE! I'll never purchase from this company again."
3,okay...,Had been looking for sugar free gum balls and these were it. They are quite expensive and the are quite hard to chew. Not sure we will buy again!
1,old inventory,"The gum quality was poor, I regret to report. It appeared to be quite old inventory. Some of the gum balls are ok, but not a majority."
3,Disappointed with these,"Okay, these are WAY overpriced, but that's not why I gave them only 3 stars: they're just not flavorful at all. Texture (probably because they're sugarfree) is odd, and what little flavor they have disappears very quickly.I'll keep looking for a better gum ball."
5,KC And The Sunshine Band,"I love to see videos of concerts from the 70's, 60's and 50's. We are very pleased with this volume 1. We already have volume 2."
2,OK sort of,This book had very few clip art designs that were of any use. The concentrated on some masks but no real designs. The other book had a CD in it and had all the same pictures too. This was a better investment. Wish I had known that before I wasted my money on both books. Neither were very good. Have several Dover clip art books and this was one of the most disappointing.
3,Okay,"Definitely not my favorite. Just not a lot of character or plot development, and had a hard time liking any of the characters."
5,Excellent Book!,I love any books that are about time travel but when it is a really good love story nothing beats it!!
5,Nora Roberts strike again!,I certainly hope this is the beginning of at least a trilogy. Couldn't put it down. The characters are so well portrayed you feel like they are old friends. The fact that time travel is involved opens up a myriad of possibilities. Time will tell......
3,Times Change,The book was good but not as exciting as other Nora Roberts books I have read. it got a little boring. I like a little more action.
3,Not a Bad Afternoon Read,"These authors (unlike some others) do a good job of combining their writing styles and thoughts and come together to write ""Success...""This book captures the exploits of Tyrone AKA Contessa Aventura. Tess is a cross dressing gold-digger whose past catches up with her in the worst way. There is also a love story or two thrown in here. Not to mention the ever-present and all too tired story line that includes reconciliation of a jail-bird brother with his widly successful younger brother.By the way, these authors mentioned that they wanted to show African-Americans in a positive light, well ""drug-dealing to feed the family cause the daddy walked out"" didn't do it for me.All in all, not a bad read and I finished it in one day.Kristy PhillipsSister 2 Sister Book Club"
1,More of the Same....,"that is, pure, unadulterated, bona-fide garbage disguised as a book. Idiotic from beginning to end. This thing came out less than a month ago and there are already 25 used/new copies for sale at lower prices. That tell you something? Save your money. Buy a real book. These 2 aren't authors; they're hacks."
4,A - Book,"This book was well worth the read. Much better than the prequel Revenge is best served cold. This novel is action packed from beginning to end and ""Tyrone""...you won't be able to get enough of him. Fast paced with lots of twists that moves you right along with the books. Just enough characters ...not too many things going on at once but no chance of boredom with the characters illustrated. Also the author did an excellent job of keeping Dakota and Morgan in the background (they were the main characters in the first novel)giving just enough attention to them so that prequel readers know what happens to them w/o dwelling on them as main characters. Get the book especially since it has been out for a few years and I am sure you can get it at a really cheap price."
1,Glorified Historical Fiction,"The Battle of New Market, VA was an unusual event in the Civil War, because it was the only time in American history that active military school cadets participated in battle. So, I wanted to get more information on this battle, and when I got this book, I was excited to read it. Unfortunately, that excitement did not last long. The author chose to write this account of the battle in the style of a novel, even down to putting words in the characters' mouths in the form of running dialogue. I do not question Mr. Gindlesperger's sources, and the appendix was intersting to me. The book just read more like ""The Killer Angels"" than a factual account of a battle."
4,Great Nero Wolfe DVD boxset! But.....,Wonderful boxset! A&E were phooey numbskulls not to have continued this show on cable. Phooey on them! Anyway...this DVD boxset is a joy to watch. Great performances all around and Timothy Hutton and Maury Chaykin are born to play respectively Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe. Only quibbles are that A&E did not make more of them and that they chose to pan and scan the episodes for the DVDs instead of leaving them in their originally shot widescreen aspect ratio. Also skimpy on the extras. But a good buy to have the complete episodes that were made for rewatchability. Great scoring by Michael Small who has since passed. Sadly Maury Chaykin has passed too. Maybe PBS can bring this back with Timonthy Hutton and another Nero....? Witty and humorous!
4,Nero Wolfe - The Complete Classic Whodunit Series Rocks!,"I had the fortune of catching this series back when it was on the A&E Channel originally. I really liked it then, and decided to buy it for my Dad for Christmas after hearing how sick he was of the new shows that are on now a days. I don't know why, but if you buy the complete series it turns out to be cheaper than getting them separately. I highly recommend these DVDs."
1,Big disappointment !,"Have an Australian format ( PAL ) set before deciding to buy a Region 1 set from Amazon especially when the item was described as one that comes with closed captions. When the first purchase arrived without closed captions, this was advised to Amazon who graciously set a replacement set which is exactly the same as the first one.DOES ANYONE AT AMAZON CHECK/VERIFY simililar complaints before repeating the mistake.Like I said, I want a set that comes with closed captions.This is my favourite series of this genre even without the closed captions."
1,Most disappointing,"I have to agree with the other one-star review for thi set. The the shouting grates on one's nerves. There is greater focus on the actors than on the story, with the result that one has the feeling of watching the same script over and over again because the story line gets lost again and again. The actors seem unable to stop barking, shouting or hurling insults at each other. If that is humor, then someone has lost his way.Why did I watch the entire series if it is so dreadful? Well, I confess that having spent so much money on the set, I kept hoping that it would improve. Secondly, I found it difficult to believe that so many high ratings could be so wrong. The producers of the DVD compilation seem to have been aware of the flaws because the final disc is acceptable (though nothing to rave about). That is very, very expensive entertainment."
2,Nero Wolfe,The stories are very slow moving. Tim Hutton is miscast. I think I made a big mistake on this purchase.
2,Almost unbearable,"As an avid reader of the original novels, I looked forward with relish to watching these episodes, having read a number of enthusiastic reviews and assurances that the televised series was quite faithful to the original. Alas, it was all flummery... I found these to be painfully un-enjoyable. The self-conscious cutsiness of the staging, acting, and above all, the music - ugh, the music! - poisoned the entire thing for me. Hutton's Archie is probably the worst part. Chaykin's Wolfe isn't bad, actually (he's probably the best part) but it's true he's not quite heavy enough as one other reviewer noted.I actually wish I'd never seen these - it's taking a while to get the bad ""taste"" out of my imagination which is temporarily intruding on my continued enjoyment of the original novels."
5,Nero Wolf Series,We purchased this series for my wife's parents and they are loving it.We all miss the show it's great to have such a good quality copy of the complete series.Everything was delivered as promised.
4,nero wolfe dvd,"Really pleased with this purchase, it arrived earlier than I expected and I'm over the moon. I haven't watched all the episodes as yet but it won't take long. After reading some of the books, I'm really enjoying seeing the stories come to life on the screen. Thanks again for making this possible."
5,Simply excellent,"Rex Stout's detective stories are among the very best of the genre. They are pure detective stories, not ""action"" stories or ""crime fiction."" Stout invented a completely different sleuth; Nero Wolfe is a corpulent orchid fancier who seldom leaves his Manhattan brownstone but has his junior partner, Archie, do the leg work. The writing was literate, the plots cerebral.These TV depictions of the Rex Stout tales capture everything perfectly. Maury Chaykin is marvelous as Nero Wolfe, and Timothy Hutton is at least adequate as Archie. Before watching these I wasn't sure Hutton was up to playing the sometimes strongarm sidekick, but he does it fine.Rather that try to bring the stories up-to-date, the producers wisely retained the 1950's atmosphere, clothes, prices, cars, etc. Thus, the series transports the viewer back to that era.Anyone who enjoyed the Rex Stout writings will surely enjoy these DVDs again and again. To those who don't enjoy these--""Pfuii,"" as Wolfe would say."
3,"Fun, but not faithful to novels","A great family fun series, worth the money and seeing more than once! I have to admit, that being a fan of the Nero Wolfe series, I am bias on the details. This series is well done, has plenty of humor and very good acting. The colors and sets are great. However, I was distracted by the missing or changed details of the stories themselves (I have read the novels/shortstories series several times and listened to it on tape and CD even more). However, it is a fun show and I would have liked to see the series complete all the novels!"
5,Love Rex Stout's books? Love these too.,"I enjoyed Nero Wolf when seen on A & E then after two years it was discontinued. I have missed it. I am now reading the series of 42 books in the Nero Wolf series written by Rex Stout. The stories as written are followed closely to the finest detail in the video productions. If you like Rex Stout's style, you will love the videos too. The cinematography is excellent, characters portrayed as intended and unlike many books-made-into-films, seeing the films ARE as good as the books."
1,Yuk!,"This work is a clunky transcription in at least three languages. Almost every other word is an outrageous typo! It must be a raw scan transcribed to text by a computer. There is not one illustration in the work. It's not worth 10 cents. Opening to a random page (163) treats us to: ""wings not distinctly jjetiolate"", ""pai'tly confliient"", ""bi t with distinct darker sj ots on cross-veins and liifurcations"" and ""which )ears a style as lono- as the joint itself."" That's just some of the more amusing stuff from the bottom of the page. It's far from everything. Need I say more? To the other three people in the world who were considering buying this book: save your money!"
4,A Romance Junkie,Solo saw Penny for the first time in a magazine at the wedding of her father and stepmother. When he finally met her in person he knew she was the one for him. The only problem was that Penny was barely nineteen to his thirty-two... Penny fell in love with Solo at first sight but it was a bumpy ride and I enjoyed every moment. This book was really good and I recommend it highly.
4,casi,"Charleen's review here is right on- too bad, this could have been an excellent movie- they have the story (stories), all the actors are cast right, filmed nicely- I just wish they would have taken more time with this."
4,Great movie!,"This is a great film. I had seen it before and really liked it, do I decided to get it. I'm glad I found it on amazon, and at a great price too!"
5,Rare On Original Vinyl - Tina (Tiny) Brooks & Freddie Hubbard,"If you haven't heard this combo you're missing a key piece of the 1950's/1960's jazz puzzle. Tina Brooks did not last long, but gained quite a folowing from his meager recorded output. Also recommended would be ""Open Sesame"" by Freddie Hubbard. Brooks was not as technically proficient as some sax men and certainly played some inappropriate notes, but he had a fine tone and sense of melody. His improvisations were influenced by his R&B background but were always interesting. Freddie Hubbard meanwhile was much better known and perhaps more musicaly ""schooled"". The two horns mixed well on these tunes with the unison phrases being very appealing. Duke Jordan's piano work was near perfect here and Sam Jones on bass and Art Taylor on drums provided solid rhythm support. These songs are all quite engaging. I think any bop or cool jazz fan will be happy if they include this in their collection."
1,piece of junk,"Lately, my Garmin C320 takes so long to locate signal, after installing this external antanna, no improve in time at all, piece of junk"
4,Good Old-School Gabba and Hardcore,"Yeah, Dave Rogers spins party-core nowadays, but in his prime, he mixed some mad foot-stompin dark and twisted gabba. Alpha Decay is probably the best example of his skill back in the day when he was still legitimately Hardcore. HCMF and War are personal favorites, but Hardcore Chicago and the remix are all classic Hardcore/Gabba trax. Good stuff."
2,DISAPPOINTING :(,"Delta Nine is clearly an outstanding hardcore gabber dj representing Chicago. However, Alpha Decay is extremely disappointing as compared to his recent live sets. It comes no where near capturing the rush of energy experienced one of his shows. So you wanna hear Delta Nine?..don't purchase this one."
2,Not introductory nor reference material,"I bought because it seemed to cover the subjects in more details when Java 3D tutorial could not. However the Java3D tutorial of Sun is much more detailed and instructive when compared to this book. I extensivly needed Geometry Info sturctures info (i.e. building Shape3D s with custom points) however the book gaved the whole topic in a few paragraphs as it does in other topics.There are no accompanying CD that include code, thus it is again harder to see techniques. The book is amateurishly composed, and the code examples are very difficult to read (no emphasizations, no bold lines, no comment highlightings...)I recommend this book only if you can afford a book that will not help you much and urgently need a Java3D book."
2,Clearly insufficient,"Does very little more than the java 3d tutorials. If you've already gone through the tutorials, this book will undoubtedly dissapoint."
2,not for a beginner,"I agree with previous reviewers-- this book is not a whole lot different from Java tutorials. I'm a long-time java programmer, but with no 3d graphics experience. I found it difficult to pick up basic graphics concepts from this book. Thus, I bounced back and forth between this book, the java3d tutorials, and other tutorials I found on the internet. This book has some value in that it provides a handy reference for some aspects of java3d programming. But there are major gaps in explanation. For another option, try ""Computer Graphics Using Java 2D and 3D"" by Zhang/Liang"
5,What you would expect,"I purchased this season (somone had already given me season one), because I hope (in time) to obtain the entire series. This is one of those programs that becomes timeless. I have to say however, that I did enjoy the earlier seasons the best. The longer a show runs, the harder it becomes to keep the plots fresh and interesting. So buy and enjoy. I think you will be pleased."
5,great product,ve searched years for something to help my hair-I found it-now I can wash my hair apply the power dressing and not have to use the curling iron.
4,Nice for casual reading,I got this for my husband's birthday. He's a Spaniard so he loved it. Very nice pictures etc. Also gives great vacation ideas.
5,WHO KILLED LITTLE BOY !!!!!,I tell you what I found this movie because I always wondered just where did all the samples from Ghostface Killah's 1st album came from. What I found was this movie and what I learned about the Education of Sonny Carson it was a school of hard knocks. I really enjoed this movie my friends did to. Its was interesting to see how the gangs were almost revered as like heros. During the parade they were just walking and chanting banners and all with a huge following. It's a real movie. It shows the brief celebrity status they received when living that lifestyle and when reality catches up the harsh realization that the glory days are over. This is a blaxplotation film but its not a me against the man type of thing its life that so many to this day still seem to struggle with. This is a welcomed edition to the collection and I highly recommended.
2,Highly over rated film and bad dvd sync,I read mostly all of the reviews for this movie before I purchased it. The story line was good but has some terrible acting in it. The movie jumped around to fast and did not blend or mesh well from scene to scene.The actors words and mouths did not sync together. I hate watching movies like this! I tend to watch their mouth instead of the actual movie itself.
2,Good Story Line.....Horrible Movie!!!!!!!,"I liked the story line of the movie alot, but I just couldn't get over how the actors act. At some parts it just dragged on. And I hated the ending. It left you hanging. Ok, his girl is on drugs and she gets to the hospital never tells you who calls the hospital or what. and it just ends. Does she get better do they get back together. Yes we all know that he is going to start following the right path but come on now. I need more. And the pastor. He looks like he was on drugs. WHO KILLED LIL BOY!!!!!!!!! MAN I DONT KNOW YOU TELL ME. lol. I dont know It just didnt do anything for me. I liked warriors alot better. I just felt liek they could have done something more w/ the story line. Also if you read the back of the DVD cover its like it tells you the story. I was just disappointed at the end."
2,Education of Sonny Carson,"I found this movie to be a typical low-budget independent movie. The movie displayed the despair of living in urban America. This movie was the fore-father of movies/cable shows like The Wire, etc."
3,i'll leave trademarks around your eyes,"Found this movie from listening to Tony Starks aka (Ghostface Killah: MEMBER of Wu-Tang)This is a pretty good flick. Showing up and commings of young ""guns"" growin up and out! I love the TRUE DIALOGE that is used. I hate watching tv, movies where they don't speak the REAL way someone would in different situations, races, parts of the world.(I mean really.... Nobody in the ""HOOD"" is saying ""Hi, Mother"" rather than ""Hay Ma"") Note really that important.. but you catch my drift.anyway.. Good flick"
2,"Buyer Beware, it's no Bowflex","After owning and using a real Bowflex for years, this item pales in comparison. Cheap construction (the seat pad is already falling apart), poor design (the seat will not adjust to a good position to do upper body exercices) and limited function (only one exercise for the legs). For $400.00 you do not get much. I would recomend finding a used Bowflex."
1,Not Accurate,"The text in this book is cute, but not accurate. It describes Joseph, Mary's husband, as the proud father three times. Jesus is the Son of God, that's the basis of Christianity. I would not recommend this book."
5,A beautiful story!,My children LOVE this story! We read it all year long but it is especially wonderful at Christmas-time.
1,The product I received expired 9 years ago!,I read the reviews and ordered these with caution. I went on line to find where to locate the expiration date. It is in very small clear stamping on the side of the syringe. I found mine expired Feb of 02. I'm sending them back. I consider this fraud and am disappointed Amazon still allows this company to do business with them.
3,No expiration date on product,"Not sure how effective this is. Obviously a gray market item bought from dentists? But no idea how old the product is and how effective. I notice some improvement, but no pain or irritation when the gel gets on the gums, like others warn about Opal 20%. Makes me think it has lost a lot of its bleaching effectiveness. Probably not worth any more than $15. Dentist office charges $90 for same, but I'm sure that is fresh."
5,Very nice product and easy to use.,"I use these with an old set of Dentist provided mouth pieces from several years ago. The 20% solution is very mild. I wear them for 2 hours a day for 2 days, then use the rest as maintenance. Every once in a while I will use the 35% solution to help with coffee and tea stains."
4,Works good,"It works well ....but you have to use it regularly. Is tricky to get it to come out evenly, but with a bit of practice it isn't too hard. It does a pretty good job"
1,"Too much fuss, Too much mess",Totally disapointed! Way too much mess and way too much fuss. Sat for 4 nights with bleaching trays for no improvement whatsoever. Get much better results from Crest White Strips.
1,Beware of lead poisoning,"I returned this griddle to the seller because of a label attached to the electric cord which stated: Warning. The power cord on this product contains lead, a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling. This warning was not written on the packaging or the instruction booklet but only attached to the cord. Fortunately I noted the warning as soon as I unpacked the griddle and quickly repacked it to return to the source of purchased...and of course washed my hands. This item was made in China."
2,Expected MUCH more,"Coming from the Piper's I expected much more. With a paucity of good solid children's books, I was delighted to see this book on the market and bought it is a second, based on the content of other books from them. However, there was nothing like the contect of John MacArthur's children's book... $10 is a LOT to spend on this very simple book that is not at all original... disappointed."
5,"Cute, nice book","I wanted a clear, easy to read and understand book for a small child who was 3. This book was perfect. Colorful, and very easy to understand. She can read it to herself now and she feels like a ""big girl!""I always get good prices at Amazon!"
4,Good product but pricey,"Not much to tell about this purchase, but Amazon keeps harrassing me for a review, so here it is.The protector hasn't tripped yet, but I assume that it will work if it has to. It is a little pricey, but assuming it does its job, it will be worht it if it is ever needed. I think of it like insurance."
4,"Awkward, but worth it.","This is a very large and reasonably heavy outfit. It is quite awkward to deal with but it works as advertised. Just follow the simple instructions. I feel a lot better now with this power protector. Like you, I have a lot of money tied up in my RV and even though this is expensive it probably only takes one bad hookup and it will pay for itself."
2,VHS The Glass Key,I do not own a VCR anymore. Can't imagine why this movie isn't on a DVD. The VHS tapes have gone the way of the dinosaur. They are a dime a dozen at auctions.
2,not much here,"A very dull movie. Acting is stiff and silly. This could hardly be called ""film noir."" It's just black and white."
3,A Neat Guide,"While by no means a complete guide to herbs and their magickal properties, this book gives scads of information on over 25 hers that you'll most likely recognize by name. Broken into categories such as ""Sacred Protection"", ""Love and ""Death"" and ""Healing and Comfort"" under each herb, there are reecipes and ideas for how to use each herb for the designated purpose.I really enjoyed reading this, and it's absolutely beautiful. If you're looking for comprehensive information, however, another book might be a better choice."
5,THE GUY IS A GENIUS!,"This is another one of my favorites. If it didn't offend fundy christians, would it still be funny? Of course not, but that's exactly why it IS extremely funny!!!"
1,I hated this book,"I totally hated this book, I kept on reading it because I don't usually leave books halfway ..... but it really bothered me while I was reading it. Too bad because I had high expectations for this book."
3,The Night I Got Lucky,"Be careful what you wish for is a hackneyed phrase, but one Billy learns the truth of when she is given a jade frog by her therapist after making a few wishes. Soon, those wishes begin to come true. She is promoted suddenly, the co-worker on whom she has a crush reciprocates her feelings, and her husband becomes the ideal mate. Yet, each of these desires being fulfilled comes with a price that quickly becomes too high. Billy wants things to be the way they once were, but has no idea how to make things right when it all goes wrong. She can't even get rid of the blasted frog.*** This modern day parable is told in a breezy, first person style that conveys a serious warning in a light way. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
5,Fabulous and Fun Book!!!,I loved this book! It was so much fun to read and a real page turner. The characters feel very real and just about anyone can relate to story. And even better that it was set in Chicago. I highly recommend this book.
3,Stop me if you think you've heard this one before,"The idea behind this latest Red Dress Ink offering sounds like something off of an episode of The Brady Bunch. Our protagonist, Billy, gets a promotion, her husband's complete devotion, and the affections of a co-worker all after getting a jade frog from her therapist. Overnight, her life is changed.Uh, hello?I'm not opposed to this particular plot, but it's carried out to the extreme. When Billy tries to get rid of the lucky charm, it keeps reappearing in her room. I like the fact that she confronts her past demons, but doing so through the help of a therapist's charm is just too much.I enjoy the Red Dress Ink series, but this one is a bit over the top- even for the most ""escapist"" of readers."
3,What if all your dreams came true?,"You know the old saying ""be careful what you wish for""? Well, in Billy's case her wishes come true. Which should be all good, right? This is a book about getting everything you want in life, but soon realizing that what you want has been with you all the time. This is a fast read, although I didn't feel that I really knew the characters. This is my first chick lit book by this author. I will read more by her."
5,This Book is Excellent - a must have,"This book is a very practical and valuable book on performance tuning of HP 3000 systems. The author (Rober Lund) has been working with HP 3000 systems for 12 or so years and has supported, consulted and managed thousands of HP 3000s. He really knows his stuff. His company (Lund Solutions) also makes a tool that we used on our performance benchmark project. The book references the tool (HP 3000 SOS Performance Advisor & Gallery) and makes it very easy to ascertain the perfomrance bottlenecks of your HP 3000 systems (both Classic as well as PA RISC machines)....I am an IBM employee. I still thought the book was very good and was very valuable during our performance testing and benchmarking effort of and HP 3000 system. I had no experience with the HP 3000 Operation System before."
1,Do not order this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this book for my masters class in Educational Assessment. Because I am in Early Childhood, I thought the book would be helpful. I began reading the first chapter of the book and I noticed it was about Designing curriculm in early childhood education. As I continued to read, I saw that begininng of the second chapter was missing. The book is put together completly wrong. The publishers inserted the wrong first chapter into the book. Also the book has a million typos, spelling, and grammar errors. If you do not want the hassel of returning this book, do not bother buying it. You will be dissappointed."
1,over charged,I order one book they sent 2 books. I asked for regular shiping of 3 dollars and they charch me 7 dollars. But they did refund me for the extra book.
4,Good book for orbital mechanics only,"The book presents a very detailed introduction to orbital mechanics. However, it does not deal with spacecraft rotations, which are an important part of spacecraft motion. Therefore, the book is advisable if you are planning to study only orbital mechanics. I would recommend that you refer to another text book if you want a more complete introduction to astrodynamics."
5,Every Orbit Guy Has One,"The true measure of the usefulness of any technical book is how many people own it. Every orbit guy I know (including me) has one. Just about every satellite ops person I know has a copy. Very few books indeed are generally known by the authors' initials, but ""BMW"" is one such book.The book provides information required to perform basic orbital analysis. Even when I'm doing analyses far beyond the technical scope of the book, it is the first one I reach for."
5,Excellant first book,The book isn't intended to be all things to all people. It covers fundamentals. I have worked in the field and keep two copies ;)The review of vector mathematics in the appendix is especially useful for non-specialists who want to start studying this topic.
4,Great Little Introduction,"A quick examination of the table of contents gives an idea of the scope of topics for this text. It covers a wide range of topics with a pretty good introduction to the general problem of ballistic missile trajectories. Some of the terminology is a bit dated, however, which can cause some confusion to readers familiar with some of the material. For example, it uses the term ""Geocentric-Equatorial Coordinate System"" to describe a geocentric Cartesian frame better known as the ""Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI)"". However, this does not diminish the value of the material contained in this work. I highly recommend it as an introduction to astrodynamics.George ChastainSoftware Consultant/Systems EngineerHuntsville, Al"
3,Okay but not as powerful as others I have taken,"These are just okay. They don't have the ""strength"" that others I have taken in the past have...probably will try a different brand next time."
4,Everyone needs digestive enzymes at times,"This product works differently for different people, it doesn't mean that certain blood types, ages or this that or the other determine its efficacy. A person that has or gets acid reflux or has problems with digestion benefits greatly from this. I do not have either but bought this to try out, I haven't noticed any difference except for some others that I have given this to that had digestion issues. They noticed a drastic improvement in their digestion and less stomach cramps from eating certain foods."
3,Specific party designs lead to hard-to-replicate Results,"As a big fan of David Tutera and his ""empire"", when I found out that he had written books for the average person about planning parties, I was thrilled. I had hoped that through his books, he would teach the reader the basics of planning a party that would be remembered. Although he does illustrate several beautiful parties, and describes them beautifully using ""taste"", ""smell"", ""look"", etc., I found the parties he included were very unique and specific. Each party was done beautifully, but he didn't include tips where one could apply the concepts he described in those parties to her own. In addition, I felt that the parties he did include were not ones that the average person could replicate without serious help-- or have an occasion to replicate them! Despite this, I'm still in awe of David Tutera's talent, and I look forward to reading his other books in the hope that they would be of a greater help."
5,The Party Planner,"I have started a personal event planning business and there was a wealth of information, I especially liked the tips section in each chapter."
3,It's alright,I didn't find many of his ideas that I would use. Most were alittle too over the top. I would scale them down.
1,Crappy latch,I bought this latch for my brothers 2000 dodge pick up it said it was supposed to fit but it wasn't long enough it hardly holds it together and if you try to open the window from the outside after 2 try's at opening it it will open and you can break In to the vehicle
1,Hate it,"broke on first use, dont bother with this. Cheap plastic material and crappy pressed style. It didnt even make it past being screwed on."
2,2 episodes after 10 minutes of ads,"My son is a huge fan of Dora, and the material is great. Unfortunately the quantity of advertising at the beginning of this video is outrageous. I know that Ads at the start of a video are the standard, but over 10 minutes before the video starts on a child's video is outrageous. To wade through this much advertising to see the content they should give the video away for free. Yes, you can use the fast forward button every time your child watches, or you can record episodes easily direct from your own T.V. As this tape only contains two twenty minute episodes you won't have to work to hard to make your own comparable tape."
4,Best animated baby's video -- 8mo.-2 yrs,"We didn't realize how much our daughter liked Dora until our local cable company dropped ""Nick Jr."" programming, when she was 8 mo. old. At age 15mo. she saw Dora's picture at a bookstore, and thereafter would ask us, ""D-D-D-Dora"". Anything an 8 mo. baby remembers that long must be good.So we got the Prince video, and the only problem is our tolerance for r-r-r-repeat showings.We really like the clear language used, the repitition, the sort of ""normal"" fantasies (as opposed to sensory overload action/sound), and the Spanish inclusion. If they'd do the same stories with Chinese inclusions (or French, etc., etc.,) that would be great.Our great objection is the 7 minutes of senseless advertisements at the beginning of the tape. When will Americans wake up and object forcefully to the invasive carcinoma that is excessive commercialization of society?"
3,good,"Bought this for My niece an she loves Dora, WIll buy products again from this selleri n the future if need be"
2,Less than stellar,I must agree with some of the other reviews herein; the advertising is heavy-handed in the beginning and this sort of thing is what would encourage one to just tape the shows off of the TV instead of buying this book. It really discourages me to buy any other titles from Nickleodeon. Shame on Nickleodeon!
2,THE CUTEST PIECE OF JUNK!!,"I BOUGHT THIS TV LAST YEAR FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO LOVES HELLO KITTY...SHE WAS 2 AT THE TIME...THE DVD PLAYER WORKED VERY WELL THE VERY FIRST TIME AND THATS IT. I WISH I HAD READ REVIEWS BEFORE I PURCHASED IT. ITS THE CUTEST TV I HAVE EVER SEEN, AND THE REGULAR CABLE IS FINE, WORKS GREAT, BUT WE COULDNT USE THE DVD PLAYER, WHICH IS VERY ESSENTIAL TO 2 AND 3 YR OLDS! ALSO, I HAD A LEAPSTER GAME TO HOOK UP TO THE TV FOR HER, THE SPECTRA BRAND INFORMATION COULDNT BE FOUND. ITS CUTE, BUT I HAVE LEARNED TO READ REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING ANYTHING!"
2,Caveat Emptor,We bought this for our daughter. The dvd player worked for less than a week. Fortunately (?) the seller took the item back and sent another. It lasted about one month. Obviously the dvd electronics in this system are substandard. Everything works excepting the dvd. Also the set we bought in 2007 will not be compatible with local channels. This was known by the manufacturer before the sets were produced and I don't understand why they did not use digital tuners. My daughter loves the way the set looks but it's not worth the hassle.
2,"MAJOR LET DOWN, TROUBLE FROM THE START","WE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR OUR LITTLE GIRL. AFTER ONE WEEK, IT WENT TO A COMPLETELY BLACK AND WHITE PICTURES, ON WEEK TWO, THE DVD PLAYER STOPPED WORKING. WE PAID 50 BUCKS TO SEND IT BACK FOR A REPLACEMENT, THEY DIDN'T SEND OUR REMOTE BACK AND NOW ON THE SECOND TV, THE DVD PLAYER WON'T OPEN AND CLOSE, SO THE SAME MOVIE HAS BE STUCK IN THE TV FOR A WHILE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY TO SEND THE DUMB THING BACK ONCE AGAIN! MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT. SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE MORE EXPENSIVE DISNEY TV."
1,Absolute JUNK!,"This product was a Christmas gift for my little girl. It looked great under the Christmas tree, but that was about where the magic w/ this item ended.First of all, the picture is good, considering it's a pink kiddy TV.The DVD player broke about 2 wks after we first started using it. It was past the 30-day return though because I'd bought it in early Dec to be given as a gift.The seller was NOT accommodating at all. I'd love to post the name of the seller here, but I'm sure it wouldn't get published. I'll gladly pass on the name to anyone who asks for it though.The seller was willing to fix this product if I returned it AT MY EXPENSE (which was going to be $50+ due to the weight of the product) and then I'd have to pay for return shipping back to me! - I was not willing to spend another $100 on this junk TV that broke after 2 weeks of use.So, I strongly recommend not purchasing this product and to do your research before purchasing from a seller on here."
2,"Beautiful, but poorly constructed",I love how beautiful this product is...It really looks amazing in my daughters room. I am not impressed with the quality of the product. The DVD cover was off before I even took it out of the box. When her DVDs play it sounds like an engine revving up...the keys on the remote are ridiculously small and it took forever to open the battery compartment due to the small screw. This product means well but would benefit form a more quiet operation and better development.
5,Absolutely adorable,"I've been a fan of Hello Kitty ever since I was little, and when I saw this TV I had to get it. It's absolutely adorable and works like a charm. Everything from the screen saver, volume control, and channel display rings of the adorable icon. A must have!"
2,Cute little tv. when I went to hook it up on Christmas morning for my 4 year old the dvd cover fell off.,"Cant send back because my 4 year old thinks it was a gift from Santa. I expected a new product, but I don't think it is. I tried to turn on the parental locks and apparently there was already a code that I obviously don't know, so I cannot put the parental locks on the tv in my four year old daughter's room.Don't think I will be buying from this seller again."
1,Cute but not practical,My daughter loved this TV she was really into Hello Kitty and I thought it was cute but after 6 mos the DVD player quit working. I kept the TV and still use it but was a bit disappointed that the DVD player quit working so fast.
5,very easy!,This product is just what I was looking for. Easy to understand instruction and all the info I needed was right there with the product.
1,utterly useless,A complete waste of money (and trees) for any scientist or engineer interested in applying spline theory to their work. Indecipherable and highly-esoteric work suitable only for a very narrow audience. One need only check the street price of this book to see that it can't be given away. Nice binding though!
5,Fantastic sound!!,these speakers are brilliant and am over the moon with them! the sound is fantastic and can't wait to take them on holiday with me!so easy to set up!they are also good value for money!!!
3,its ok,"logic 3's sound dock for the ipod shuffle is a very basic, no frills amplifier that has adequately performed its task, play audible's books, for over a month."
3,"Average sound, good price","With the giant leaps in technolgy lately I think that the shuffle will become obsolete soon enough. That being said, Logic3 i-station is very average. I use mine for working out in the yard, when we have guests over and we want background music, or out by the lake. I ,personally, don't want to spend alot of money on accessories when I will likely upgrade in another year or so. The sound is very basic and lacks any sort of depth. This product is what it is...adequate."
1,product did not work with new shuffle,this product did not work at all with a new shuffle...it appeared to be designed for an older version of the IPOD shuffle. the only reason I did not return it was because I could find the original recent.
4,Great Value!,"This thing is great! I bought it for my girlfriend for Christmas, and she has been using it to play her old shuffle at work. We also took it on a week long vacation and I was able to play my 60GB iPod through it as well as charge it up (but oddly not at the same time, I kept getting feedback). It's a bit bigger than a trade paperback, and is suprisingly loud and decent sound quality. Well worth the price!"
1,"Shame on you, PBS!","Shame on you for cancelling ""Shining Time Station"" and replacing it with these stupid baby shows. What da heck is this! A stupid disturbingly Teletubby-like show with these fat creatures who fly, dance around the screen tra-la-la-la-la, woo-hee! What could a person expect when some of the main characters are named Grandmama and Grandpapa? Seriously! This show is worse than Barney and the Teletubbies! The makers of this show have got to be on drugs, or maybe high on acid."
2,Poor Quality,"Didn't take long... opened the package, tried to close it, and it wouldn't. Looked online for help because I thought there was something I was doing wrong. No, the button on the handle just wouldn't move. I finally coaxed the button and with 2 hands got the knife to close(comes in the open position). This knife would not open with just one hand, either.I did read most of the reviews, but I didn't think this would happen, just because some people had the same problem. Will buy an American Made knife in the near future!"
1,Not Even Quick Opening,You can buy a knife like this at any flea market. There are plastic burs along the top of the knife. It does not open quickly. You do not need to worry about it opening in your pocket. It is hard to open when you want it opened. Probably going to send this junk back.
2,Didn't last,Thumb stud went missing after a few weeks. Knife is unusable without it since it locks open on thumb stud for rigidity. I understand issues with quality will happen but not happy with Gerber response in getting me a new part in a reasonable amount of time. Somewhat of a blessing in disguise since I purchased a Benchmade Griptilian to fill the need and am thrilled with that product.
5,Great knife!,I gave this knife to my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it! The spring loaded blade is perfect and the clasp on the back holds it securely in his pocket. My brother loves it too so I'm going to get him one for his birthday as well !!GREAT PRODUCT!
5,Gerber 22-47162 Fast Draw Knife,"When I first received this knife, I was surprised with the ""quick draw"" capability. I was also quite impressed about the blades sharpness when received. The shipping was quick and fast. Owned the knife for 3 weeks now and haven't been able to put it down since. When I received it, unlike the other line of Gerber spring assisted knives, it instead of a knob to push for the blade to pop out. Instead you just have to push the knob on side of the blade.Overall.Great knife, a bit touchy on the opening mechanism, great locking system, and overall great knife."
4,Good work knife,"I use this little knife every day as a beat um up work knife. The steel holds an edge pretty well. The scales are a little hard feeling in the hand but acceptable. I rated this tool as a 4 star only because the sliding lock tends to freeze up a little. Maybe it will perform better with extended use.Aug. 12 2011, Well, I have used this knive for a year. I have used it exclusively for work. Very good steel. I do have a gripe though, the opening is difficult when wet because the lock button sticks. I have to downgrade to a 3 star. My Buck 112 is still the best work knife I have ever had and I have had it rebuilt twice for the price of shipping. This knife is good, but, my buck is much better."
4,"Great knife, safety lock is a bit ""sticky""","I like the knife a lot. It seems well made, was very sharp ""out of the box"", and is generally easy to open.My only (minor) complaint is the combined safety/lock switch. The sliding switch in its ""safe"" position will keep the blade from opening (if closed) or closing (if open). But what I am finding is that, not infrequently, I cannot open the knife even if the safety is, apparently, off. I then have to thumb it back and forth to get it unlocked. Not a big deal... It only takes a second and one can still do it one-handed but it is a minor irritation."
3,Disappointed...,"I had high hopes for the Gerber FAST Draw. For a while, it was my EDC (Every Day Carry) knife. It was soon replaced by another.After I removed the knife from its packaging, the blade was slightly loose from the handle and wiggled. This made me question its reliability in the future. With prolonged use, the blade started becoming more and more detached from the handle to the point where I had to store it and start using one of my other knives.Also, the blade's safety located on the handle eventually just stopped working on me.On a positive note, the Gerber FAST Draw does deserve the title it is given; this knife opens very quickly. The blade comes very sharp out of the box as well. However, reliability is key and these factors mean nothing if your knife is going to crap out on you in the future.I would tell a friend to avoid purchasing this knife."
5,Not the prettiest knife I've ever owned,"I was a little disappointed about the sharpness out of the box. A couple of swipes on a sharpening steel changed all that. Like I said, this is not the prettiest knife I've ever owned but it just shouts efficient tool. If you're right handed. I am and everything is right where it should be. With a little practice, the time from pocket to use is a matter of a second.The blade is substantial and sturdy, I've used mine for anything from chipping ice to slicing up pork ribs.Steve"
3,nice knife,"i really like gerber knives, i have many others also.you need to get used to it, but once you do it's cool.it's very safe (will not open in pocket, and it's not scary), a stable locking mechanism, can be opened slowly or quickly depending upon how you manipulate the knife, again easy after some initial practice. it is not nearly fast as an auto, not even close, but you get the idea, and its legal, and can use one hand. my Spyderco Delica is still my first choice pocket knife, which can be opened at same speed with less practice, but still a very fun, cool, functional knife.Updated review: I lowered the star ranking on this because it is hard to stay sharp. I have shapened this knofe three times already and it is dull again. I'm a moderate to light user, around the house type of uses. It still opens fast and is in fact faster than since i bought it."
1,Why bother...,"I have owned a Gerber multi-tool for more than 15 years, used it for all kinds of things & never experienced any problems with its quality. That (& the 3"" blade) is why I chose to buy this knife. The first one arrived with a broken lock/switch. Amazon made the exchange easy & quick. The replacement gave me 6 months of limited use before the spring broke. I will not buy another Gerber."
4,Nice pocket knife,"It's a little tough to get open,but I think that's because they don'twant it flipping open in yourpocket, otherwise nice knife."
1,Fast Draw Spring Assisted Opening is a Poor at best,"I just received my Gerber 22-47162, and am very dissapointed with the Fast Draw Spring Assisted Opening. I am 6'2 230lbs and I absolutely can not open the blade using the pivot screws. The reason i purchased this knife is because of the Forward Action Spring Technology (FAST), in my line of business I need a quick engagement."
3,This is a cheap knife.,"This knife being less then 30USD is not a bad deal. The spring assist needs some getting used to. You need to push up with your thumb instead of to the side like a normal stud assist. My three big beefs with this knife is:1 - This knife will not be sharp when it is new and the steel is soft.2 - The handle of this knife will be slippery when wet.3 - Like I said above, the blade quick release stud needs to be pressed in a certain way to make it easy."
4,My first fast draw spring assist knife.,This is a pretty good product. The knife came decently sharpened and in good condition. I did have problems with my knife when I first got it though. Like i said this is my first spring assist knife and the safety switch to me was very sticky. Solved the problem with a little bit oil and just constantly flicking it on and off. Now after like a month or two it switches with a push of the thumb with not too much pressure but still able to lock when I need it. Overall good knife but takes a bit getting used to I guess.
2,Fast seller,A good price for a gerber knife. Kind of disappointed with the knifes mechanism though. Doesn't really open fast like you would think after reading review. Not the sellers fault though.
1,Disipointted,"All the other Gerber products I have I love but this knife i bought broak after 3 days, the spring or switch inside of it broak and know it wont flip open or lock in place when opened."
2,Mediocre,"The mechanism on this knife is nice, and the build quality is decent. Unfortunately the blade itself has not held up well. It seems it's made of cheap metal, and doesn't hold an edge. There are chips in my blade as well after about a year of light use. This is the first time I've been disappointed by a Gerber knife. Quality has clearly dropped. I'm only giving it two stars since I feel a knife that can't hold an edge deserves no more, regardless of it's solid build quality."
2,Not what its made out to be,When I ordered this item I expected a button not a switch to pop open the knife. The knife comes super dull and the switch is hard to use with just your thumb. Not worth the money
4,Great Knife for the Money,"This is a fantastic pocket knife, especially for those who need/want to be able to have the luxury of assisted opening. The locking mechanism (which has the ability to lock the knife both open and closed) is also a nice feature. Overall it is an extremely well-built knife. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because sometims the locking button feels just a bit gritty, and there is a tiny amount of play in the blade with it locked open. These are by no means significant flaws, and I would still highly recomend this knife for the price."
5,Nick,"For $15, this knife was awesome, it requires only one hand to operate, and has a firm, but also flexible clip."
2,way too hard to open with thumbstuds,"Sometimes it was reasonably easy to open with the thumbstuds, and other times it wasn't. I would flip the lock back and forth to make sure it wasn't stuck, but I would still have intermittent problems."
3,dad,I was looking for a lefthanded knife this knife is just a left hand carry. The mistake was a misunderstanding on my part. The knife is of great quality. the item was shipped faster than I had exspected.
3,"good knife, dumb features","This is a decent knife. It comes nice and sharp, holds an edge ok, and its easy to sharpen. The FAST draw technology is insanely fast. Just tap on the thumb stud and with a loud snap the blade is open and fixed. Because of this I am scared to carry it. an angry cop could easily arrest you for an illegal switchblade. I'm keeping the knife for working at home and outdoorsing, but for every day I want something without the FAST draw"
2,Knife stayed in locked position only after a day of use,"Like many have said before, Gerber is usually associated with quality and good design. Unfortunately, this knife does not live up to that reputation for me. It somehow locked on the open position after one day of use."
1,Print on Demand,"I purchased the book on color theory in quilting without noticing that it is a 'print on demand' copy of the book. The concept of 'print on demand' is fine if only the text matters however there are numerous examples of color theory throughout the book and all of the images are very degraded and lifeless. Disappointingly each quilt appears washed out, no luminosity or subtle shades of color are appreciable. The didactic analysis is very interesting and reflects the authors thorough knowledge of the subject but as she explains her theories you cannot escape the frustration of referring to the numerous beautiful quilts which are presented as blurry images over and over: Quilter's Hell. The book is great but save your money for the real thing!Judith"
5,Great to listen to when painting,"I usually put this in when I start to paint.It keeps the mind from flowing somewhere else. Like the bamboo pitchers in a zen garden. It's there for two reasons. To keep the person that is meditating, from drifting off somewhere else, and also to scare off deer.This album keeps your mind grounded and scares off any wandering thoughts."
3,Nothing less than solid,"This is a consistent collection of medium-hardy noise. There is something in the booklet included about amplified staple-gun sounds--these might have provided the raw material but it doesn't seem to be the case--if it is, the band did a good job of playing with these sounds and disguising their true identity, not that I think I would recognize amplified staple-gun sounds when I heard them, but I think I would. Anyway what I heard were various sounding droning machines, intermittent fuzz, whines, whistles, and so on. Track #3 is my favorite with its very low sounding drones: tall-seeming, clumsy and clambering machines. Pleasant enough, in full, to lull me to sleep."
4,Cookbook of Interventions,"A good compendium of intervention recipes. Lots of team activities. I have found a number of these available on the web, but this does compile them together. No theory, just recipes. You should already have a concept of your OD strategy, then use this as a reference."
5,A great book for city babies!,"Not only is this a good bilingual book, but it's one of the very few ""first words"" books out there for city kids. There's a great selection of words that will be instantly recognizable to the city kid, with very pleasing graphics."
4,Awesome Music!!!,"For some reason, I feel like the only 19 year old that appreciates the classic music from the 50's. I think Buddy Holly is an awesome singer! So far, my favorite songs are That'll Be The Day, Not Fade Away, and It's So Easy! If you are a Holly fan, you'll love BUDDY HOLLY GOLD!!!"
3,Buddy Holly Gold,"The album has all of Buddy's biggest hits; however, it also has a lot of songs that I have never heard of and were not very good. If your intention is to use the album to extract the great songs for use on an MP3 player or Ipod, this album is a great source. Listening to the album from start to finish is really tedious, because of all of the superfluous songs on it."
5,The greatest,"Buddy Holly was ahead of his time , writing and performing his music.I have his CD greatest hits in all my cars as a daily reminder of his music"
5,grate emo/pop punk band,I used to lision to these guys a lot I rember the day I left my vynal in my car and waped it.. it grate to see it out on CD if you can find the earlyer 7 inch it grate much faster.. Not a bif of the gratest hits.. this is more politicaly charged were to gratest hits is more emo.
4,as natural as possible,i was happy to find a product with zinc pyrithione in it and not a lot of other gobblygook that i found unnecessary.
4,"Worked great, but in tandem with another product...","My husband had Tinea Versicolor, very large, discolored scales all over his back and sides of his torso. Dermatologist recommended this soap to help cure and prevent future occurence. Used it for a few weeks and only minimal improvement. He then switched to Nizerol AD, which only worked minimally as well, even with the doctor's orders of applying the shampoo directly to the skin and letting it dry before rinsing. However, on a hunch, we had him used both, the itching and irritation were gone the next day, and the discoloration was almost gone within 2-4 days. He continues to use this soap as a preventative measure and no flair ups since. Great product, but use with the shampoo and its magic! I only put 4 stars instead of 5 because it depends on whether you use it with the Nizerol AD shampoo. Thanks!"
4,DermaZinc Soap,"I have mild rosacea, but also live in a very dry climate. My skin is very dry, to the point of having flaky patches throughout the day. After doing some online research, I heard about Zinc soaps and decided to give this one a shot. I've been using it just under a week and can already see improvement in my skin. While the scaled/flaky spots aren't completely gone, they have diminished some. I am hoping that combining this soap with my regular skin care routine will nix those patches over time."
4,Not a bad little pot,This isn't a bad little pot for keeping chocolate hot. You do need to melt the chocolate before you put it into the pot and stir it every so often as the chocolate can burn over where the tealight is. But for the money this is great and I use it at parties all the time. It is always a hit. Take note that if you leave the lid on the chocolate will get extremely hot! Just leave the lid off and stir it every now and then.
1,Dont waste your money,"I got this product as a gift and was really excited to try it, however when I did try it, it was terrible. It burned the chocolate!! It was terrible!! It does not melt the chocolate as stated, it actually burns it. Please do not waste your money"
5,Michael Jackson Trading Cards,This was well worth the money and came very nicely packaged. In awesome condition from 1984. Awesome collector's item for any MJ fan.
5,My favorite,I was so happy to finally find this!! I've been looking everywhere!! The gingerbread cookie story is what I was looking for. I love the video. Thank you for having it.
4,A Real Gem,"This book is very entertaining. I found it for 4 bucks at a discount bookstore in an outlet mall somewhere. And when I first picked it up, it looked very boring. I thought, ""who would want to read a 600 page glossary of terms on World War II in the Pacific?"" But I thought for 4 bucks, who cares. It turned out to be a treasure trove of info that a World War II geek like myself just relishes. It's easy to read and has some humor in it too. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent reference for WWII Navy Pacific Theater,"A must have for the serious student of the Naval war in the Pacific who wants details such as the difference between an LSM (Landing Ship Medium) and an LCT (Landing Craft Tank). Is broken down into concise categories ranging from Campaigns to People. Neat chronology of events. Excellent chapter on war production and logistics. Easy read, large type, I love this book."
2,"Broad, readable, lightweight, and non-groundbreaking","I have enjoyed some of the material James Dunnigan has given us about warfare. And I enjoyed this book. But I didn't learn a great deal. If you known almost nothing about World War II in the Pacific, and want a broad, lightweight introduction, this book is okay. If you are looking for an in-depth book, or even a book with some new insights on a few detailed areas, this book probably doesn't fit the bill."
5,WONDERFUL INSIGHT INTO THE PACIFIC SEA BATTLES,ENJOYED THE BOOK VERY MUCH. GOOD MATERIAL AND WELL EXPLAINED AND DOCUMENTED
3,Readable but flawed,"For a book rich in trivia, as other reviewers write, there are some surprising errors. MUTSU blew up in Hiroshima Bay, not in Hong Kong! I buy everything by Dunnigan, even though I acknowledge that his stuff is sometimes flawed.This book, however, I got rid of. Likely to have reliability problems and errors that I cannot spot as easily as that one.Also, too much re-hashing of things that were in others of Dunnigan's books."
2,Tabloid history lacking in accuracy,"True to their sensationalistic ""Dirty Little Secrets"" series, Dunnigan and Nofi once again take the tabloid approach to history. Their eye for trivia is all encompassing and presented with the arrogance of 20/20 hindsight. Every item is presented with cynicism and an overpowering aire of contempt. The message is clear: If Dunnigan and Nofi had been running World War II we wouldn't have needed all those military dolts who blundered their way through it. If their arrogance isn't bad enough, the authors' factual errors complete the damage. The least and most obvious of such errors are misidenfication of ships.The worst errors come from their pop history tabloid approach. When they claim carriers were only developed because senior officers wanted to keep a few more high ranking billets around in an era of limited battleship commands they are showing their truest, most sensational and cynical colors. These gentlemen should work for the Star or the Enquirer."
5,Wonderfully goth....,"First of all, I must state that I am biased. I love Emily. I always have. Anything Emily, I will most likely fall in love with. That being said, lets get to the review. This journal is wonderful. The lines are slightly jagged, giving it that diary-of-a-phsyco look (perfect for me ;) ). The spot art throughout is very nice, very Emily. Another plus: the paper is extra thick. Great for all you sharpie lovers. No bleeding! Yay! One complaint...though. This journal is recomended for children. Emily may be young, but she is no child. This book is for the strange, the goth and the disturbed."
1,bad value,The product is not what it should be. It does not have a lasting scent at all. Also the scent is not at all like the same name brand in the store smells - far from it
2,Magicup,This product is not worth this price. If the company would have followed through with there offer of a free pair two may have been worth it. The company offers a free pair with purchase and did not deliver and when contacted did not respond at all.
1,Not long-lasting or invincible,"We purchased one of these yesterday evening at approximately 6:30 p.m. By 9:00, it was completely destroyed. This does not match my definition of ""tough"" and ""long-lasting""--as advertised on the packaging. Very disappointed in this product."
1,ya right... invincible my back side,this toy was tore up 8 hours after my dog started playing with it... i am very disappointed with it... now i am stuck with a useless piece of rubber sitting in my trash can...
5,Sid is AWESOME!!,"My 14 month old loves watching Sid. It is the only show she watches all the way thru since she was 4 months old. Hard to believe, but it is true. Her favorite is May and she has all the dolls. Great learning show as she grows up!! Highly recommend Sid the Science Kid!!!"
5,Educational,My son loves seeing the new things he can learn in these videos. He tests some of the new found information out.
5,Great episodes!,My daughter loves Sid the Science kid. She is captivated by the interaction because the characters and likes the humor. I love that is it teaching her a little science at the same time entertaining her.
3,"Entertaining, but....","An entertaining read that is easy to blow through. Random profanity and a gratuitous sex scene thrown in for good measure. A plane crash, a robbery, a drug addiction issue, a Nevada Cat House, arrests and international intrigue...there doesn't seem to be a good story telling ploy that is left out. I enjoyed it, but if you are interested in a more balanced account of MIT teams, and the lead character in this book (Semyon Dukach), you will be better served by watching the History Channel documentary about the team and Dukach (in which the author of this book appears) and the numerous articles on the internet (many written by team members)."
3,Quick Read,"I read this in the middle of law school exams, so take everything that follows with a grain of salt - it's a very quick read, entertaining, but much weaker than the previous blackjack book he wrote, ""Bringing Down the House."" The story follows another incarnation of the clandestine (not so much anymore) MIT teams that come around every-so-often, only this time, the technique is not card-counting in the conventional sense, but a something else. One reviewer likened it Mezrich's style to that of a movie, and it's a fair analogy. It's fast with no real regard to language in and of itself. Anyone looking to take their minds off whatever they are doing will enjoy this. Might be perfect for a flight home because you can finish it in a few hours."
1,I disliked it,No way can this be true. In the casinos they supposedly win thousands of dollars while playing with fake IDs which are meant to resemble company ID's instead of drivers' licenses or passports. But when you win that much money in the casino YOU HAVE TO FILL OUT TAX DOCUMENTATION. You can't just waltz out with 50 grand.Reads like it was written by a high school kid. An annoying high school kid. I paid almost 14 euros for it in the airport and feel bad.
2,"entertaining, but there are better novels","This book is pretty much an advertisement for one of the subject's seminars. So many things in this are clearly fabricated. If a casino sees you make hugely varying bets and coming out ahead, they will ask you to leave, ban you from the casino, then share your picture with the other casinos. It's actually fairly easy to beat blackjack, but it's hard to do it without the casino."
1,Underscore all 1-star reviews,"I totally support the comments of all other 1-star reviews and can just add that 'climactic' love scene is unbearably bad. Allie and her ""criminally flat"" stomach. Come again?"
2,Excellent Vegas Advantage Play Story,"I enjoyed the story of the MIT advantage player group. Incredible adventures, almost hard to believe some of the events happened in recent times. Seems like old Vegas mafia stuff. My only reservation was an obvious error by the author with his repeated statement that the casino had a 2% advantage over the player on the blackjack games they were playing. I'm sure the games they were playing had no more than a 1/2% edge for the house. The team is playing shoe games and the only way the edge would approach those numbers would be with a 6-5 blackjack payoff, which they are certainly not playing (hopefully they do not exist!). I don't know how such an obvious error can make it into the book, but I would highly recommend the it anyway."
4,Great story,I gave this to my boyfriend to read while he was in the field. I thought it would last him at least 2 weeks (he was there for 2 months after all). But he said it was so good he finished it in one short week. He even requested the sequel. Highly recommended by Vegas and gambling fans!
1,Fiction,This is pure fiction. Go to Vegas and try to use any of these techniques. Ha!. They cover the back of the deck in Vegas and have been for years - u simply can't use these techniques and I doubt you ever could. Please.
5,MIT blackjack,Vegas is an alternate reality. Reading this book it is sometimes hard to believe that the events described by Ben Mezrich occurred in real life - captivating read and a fascinating story of a MIT blackjack team on the run to outdo the casinos. The book reveals the three different strategies that the team employed to beat the casinos and their burly adventures and run-ins with the casinos themselves. It is a thriller.
4,Busting Vegas,"Very interesting book, however it could have been better written. Extreme amount of fluff descriptions to fill the pages."
4,"very nice for young children, and their parents","This is a very nice book (it reads like a standard English book, not ""backwards"" as a traditional Haggadah does), that is very child-appropriate. And while it is far from all-inclusive, it is a very nice supplement for a little kid who is just beginning to participate and be interested in the Passover Seder. The pictures and word-layout are excellent for a beginning reader. Also works as a coloring book, since the pictures are not colored in."
5,Perfect,Stop fumbling with squeeze tubes / ect =mess.Quick & easy pump sets on the bedside table for... quick easy / mess-less access.=perfect.
4,Good Stuff,"I bought this lube from a recommendation. I have lot of allergies and am easily bothered by, if not allergic to, lots of fragrances and chemicals. This lube didn't bother me at all. In fact, I am amazed at how it has no taste! That is great as some taste less than desirable. It does dry out a little sometimes, but so does my KY. I like this one much better."
3,Slippery...for a minute,"I read the reviews on this site and another ""toy"" site, and they swore this was a long-lasting slick liquid. They are wright about a few things...1. It is very slick and comfortable for masturbation and intercourse.2. It does not stain and cleans up very easily.3. The large bottle is great for the price.The manufacturer of this product claims it lasts a long time and does not dry sticky at all. These lines are really stretching it.1. It's sticky once it drys.2. WARNING: It drys in 3-4 minutes! Very quick drying. I don't know if you are supposed to add water (it doesn't say anything about that) or what, but you NEED the big bottle because you have to reapply it over and over again.It's ok for self-serving sessions, but if you are looking for a long-lasting, great lube, go with Wet or Wet Platinum. It excellent, but a bit on the pricey side. I hope this pushes you along. LOL"
5,True to form,"Since his 2000 debut, i've been an instant fan. I have never been disappointed by his releases or his performances. I saw him live at the Birchmere in Virginia, and while I love his CD's, his live performances are EXCELLENT.This album delivers. He has become my absolute favorite jazz performer.I always expect musical greatness from this man, and I always get it."
5,A most welcome surprise!,"I trade cds with a co-worker to pass the day. She gave this one to me because it was the least of her Euge Groove favorites. I absolutely fell in love with it. I'm not sure what she heard but I now listen to this cd everyday. Some of my very favorites include Living Large, XXL, Too Cool with one of the smoothest endings ever, Silhouette and my very, very favorite Cabolicious. The reviews have been mixed. I'm glad the opportunity came to me to hear it for myself. I believe you, too might be very pleasantly surprised!"
4,Nice Nice,"I read the reviews for this CD and said ""Hey I have to buy this."" At first I wasn't really feeling most of it. I kept listening to it and now I like it, but I am just giving it 4 because it didn't catch my attention on the very first listen. ""Livin' Large"", the title track is great."
2,Just another elevator jazz album...,"I'm not sure why people refer to this album as ""certified funk"" or imply that it's nothing more than boring smooth jazz. I mean... wow, does anyone know anything about jazz? I'm certainly not an expert, but if you're expecting contemporary Charlie Parker, you're going to greatly disappointed."
2,Weakly written; limited in scope and content.,"'Hermann Goring, Hitler Paladin or Puppet' by Wolfgang Paul is very weakly written. Covering the life of one of history's most fascinating individuals, the author, Wolfgang Paul fails miserably to deliver an interesting, well written book. Supposedly covering the life of the Reichmarshall from birth until death, this book lacks different and varied source material for quotes and does not even include a bibliography. Poorly written when compared to some of the classic works on World War II, such as Toland's work on Adolph Hitler, this book is better left on the shelf in the bookstore. One is forced to wonder if the author even bothered to do adequate research on his subject. A BIG disappointment from the first page until the last."
5,A very good book,This is a good book to get you started in the right direction on owning an american bulldog.
1,You get only 10% of what you want to know about the breed,"This book should only cost 10% of its price, because only 10% of its content is actually devoted to the American Bulldog breed. Don't blame the author, though. As with other T.F.H. publications under this series, the latter 90% of the book is ""standard"" content. You can buy a book about a Rottweiler and find the same 90% ""standard"" section (expect a lot of write-up about NYLABONE and its allied products)in it, with only the 1st 10% section devoted to the breed. YOU CAN GET MORE VALUABLE information from the few good web sites in the internet."
2,Basic Dog Book,"The first three chapters of this book talk about American Bulldogs, the fourth gets a little sketchy, Chapters 5 - 12 don't even mention the words American Bulldog; it's all generic ""dog talk"" after that. Not really what we were expecting since training, and working with, the breed is not quite the same as trying to train a peekapoo."
2,More information needed,"This book is very vague and for lack of another source, it was the only reason I bought it. True bulldoggers know the facts of this breed. Maybee someday John Germeroth of Colorado will inspire us with his knowledge and training ability"
3,should have brought another book on my trip...,"I liked the book just fine for the first few chapters, which were just about AB's. As far as house traing, health, and other issues I found this book to be very basic. Could apply to any breed of dog. I got this book right before a trip I took to California last month. After the first half of the book it was like any other dog book I read. (I read lots of puppy/dog books recently) I lost intrest then. It even tells you that certian chapters are not Blakwell's work but used with premission from 'other resources.' Which are not about AB's, and anyone with an AB knows, OUR dogs ARE different! (your AB even sit on your foot and look up at you like it knowes you own it, with love? (you know what I mean)If you want a generic puppy book then try 'puppy preschool' or one of the hundreds of other dog books."
2,for fans only,poor sound and picture=bootleg VHS quality all the way.Get alexandra live and the hits dvds before you consider this.
1,I would not buy this DVD,"The audio and video quality are exceedingly poor....think distorted AM radio with a super-8 quality picture, and you'll get the idea. It's astonshing that a company even would consider putting this on the market."
2,stranglers review,"Amazon.com was great in price and delivery. The dvd was only6 songs not seven, a better buy would be the dvd live at alexandra palace, all the great songs full show. in colour not black and white.buy that one. ok thats it thanks BB BX ny"
4,"Great video, but too short","The footage in this DVD is from the ""good"" time period of the band when they had a more punk edge. The footage is pretty good (if you're familiar with Target Video releases you know what to expect) with little cheesy effects thrown in that I could have done with out. The sound quality is pretty good. It's an awsome video, the only real complaint I have is that it's too short."
2,"A mixed book- some good, some bad","Charles Maier's collection of essays on the Cold War in Europe is undoubtedly one of the worst books it has been my misfortune to read. As a student, I am compelled to read a book that I normally would put down after the first five pages. The work is hideously difficult to read, especially without a doctor's degree in economics. Potentially interesting subject matter is made unnecissarily dull; further more, most of the authors of essays in the volume state their argument, and then become terrifically repetetive in proving it. Even as a history major, I find it difficult to find much of use in the book as it is so verbose and economically inclined as to make comprehension difficult. Avoid this book if at all possible.That said, some of the essays in the book are pretty good; one has to wade through the ponderous and boring to find them, however."
5,A groundbraeking book,"In this world of weight loss and diet books, finally a book that makes sense. Just The Weigh You Are is a no nonsense book that encourages people, no matter what size, to live healthier lifestyles. Between some of the chapters are the personal stories of people from all walks who have battled with weight and self image issues all their lives. This is a very straight-forward, no nonsense book which gives real insight into taking better care of yourself, stopping self-loathing and taking control. Whether you are thinking of losing some pounds or struggling with self acceptance, it is a must read."
4,Beltronics Express 925 Radar / Laser Detector,Picks up police radar within about 2 miles. Good value for the money.
4,Now this is news I can use!,"Being an experienced and well read gambler, I was looking for a new approach to my gaming experiences. I found it in Gollehon's ""Budget Gambler"". The book gives good methods for increasing winnings without increasing the financial risk I was already comfortable with, and it is entertaining, too. Very common sense approach, and methods are easy to use ""live"" in casinos. Reading this book felt like having a conversation with a friend who understood me. Very worthwhile gaming book."
4,Waht a wonderful disapointment,"The young musicians are wonderful, even though I was doubtful given all the hype they have received. Abbado does a terrific job getting the best they have to give. The soloist does an effortless job of the terrifying role of Lulu in the the LULU SUITE.Disappointments were lightening. I felt I was watching a youngster with a new toy playing around to see what he could do. The poor Lulu soloist looked like she was white faced as in the old vaudeville days. Lighting unnecessarily changes within the PATHETIQUE. The sound is less excellent that it should be. There are no translations in the liner notes or on the DVD of the LULU text. There should be. It's not readily available.This is one of the initial releases on the new Accentus label produced by Paul Smaczny who has done a wonderful job with the Lucerne Festival and Abbado dvds in the past. I'd hoped for the same high quality. It's not here.The music and musicians are so good, I'd still recommend it."
3,batboy,The picture show a disk jacket but the one was sent don't have one. Give you ideas to do this craft but you need time and money to make it.
2,Only fun the first time,"My seven year old got this for his birthday. The game's appearance has lots of kid appeal, and it makes four different electronic sounds that are really neat. This is one of those games where you have a board just like your opponent's and you can't see each other's. You take turns guessing where the other person has hid the pieces of your spaceship. So the entire game consists of systematically guessing and then finding out if the desired piece is in that spot. It's not very exciting. The special effects are cool, but after my seven year old played it once, he lost interest. Our four year old loves the board and the pieces and the noises it makes, and I have decided that the best use of the game is to let the younger child just use it as a plaything, since playing the game isn't much fun."
5,Speed up the Gunsmoke releases CBS!,"Glad to see season 6 is on the way for Gunsmoke. CBS has given us A-1 great quality in this series. Will buy more Gunsmoke as quick as you release them, keep them coming!"
5,HURRY UP AND RELEASE FULL SEASONS!!!,"I love this show, and Paramount is doing an excellent job with quality and sound. But please speed things up and release the full seasons instead of one volume at a time. None of us are getting any younger. I have all the released seasons and am eagerly awaiting the rest of them."
5,Great Western.,"These are great stories of days on the frontier. Matt, Kitty, Doc and Chester are all likeable characters that seem like old friends."
2,Tigger tails,Bought the tigger charm for my wife a huge Tigger fan. Had issues with the yail of tigger getting bent since it sticks off the charm. Gets caught on stuff all the time. Had to send back to get a replacement and same thing on this one also. Ends up she just don't wear this charm in worries it will get wrecked.
2,Meet Joe is only 2 of the 3 episodes,"My kids and I were really disappointed that this particular video ""Meet Joe!"" has only ""Joe's First Day"" and ""Joe Gets a Clue"". It is missing ""Steve Goes to College""! You have to buy a separate video called ""It's Joe Time"" to get ""Steve Goes to College"". Or, buy the DVD called ""Get to Know Joe"". I feel kind of cheated since on TV, they always showed the trilogy and this video seems like it should have all 3."
4,It's just what it looks like....,"If you've seen these shows on TV, you've seen this VHS. It's exactly the same as the show, but that is what I expected so I'm pleased with the video. My 3 year old little boy enjoys all of his Blue's Clues videos... he doesn't have a favorite, so I rate them all the same."
4,A Staple for Tennis-Lover's Library,"Philosophy, ethics, tennis history -- and a forward by Bud Collins! Can't ask for more in a book filled with memories. Glad I have it!"
5,De'Longhi Food Processor,Excellent service. Product received in a very timely manner and well packed. This is not my first order from Amazon and it won't be my last.
2,You could do better with a trip to Home Depot.,"First of all, this product does exactly what it's supposed to do-- protects your child from falling through the bannisters. Unfortunately, it's fairly flimsy, it's loud when your child decides to do a drum solo on it, it's very expensive considering how cheaply made the product is and lastly, you can do much better by going to your local hardware store, pay a few more dollars and purchase some plexiglas, drill a few holes and mount it the same way with zip ties. I also wouldn't feel safe if a I had a larger child. I don't think it could handle too much weight as evident when some of the holes rip when you apply too much pressure when pulling the zip ties. I still gave it two stars because it does do what it's designed for and I would have gave it three stars if it was half the price I paid for it because it's not worth the price listed."
5,Clear plastic,"I'd like to quickly state that the review who said it was not totally clear did it wrong. You have to peel the transluscent protective film OFF of the plastic barrier up. Then it is indeed perfectly clear.Took me about 15 minutes to install and does keep my 8 month old from trying to climb through or throw things between the railing. It's simple in it's function. It's just clear plastic that you cut to size and use the included hole punch and zip ties to attach to your banister.Easy.I would subtract half a star because it's easy to crease the plastic which leaves little ""non-transparent"" marks, but that was my fault really."
5,Performance Friction Pads - 98 TJ Jeep,I've used these before on my 1998 TJ. They seem to stop abot 10% to 15% better than stock factory front pads. They seem to last a reasonable amount of miles. I would buy them again.
5,Watch 'em win.,"With a current record of 11-27, the 2006 Pittsburgh Pirates have given this fan of 18 years very little to cheer about. In fact, with the exception of the 97 season, the Pirates have done almost nothing since the heart breaking 92 NLCS and haven't produced a winning season since. With this DVD we can all go back in time and watch the 79 World Series where they didn't depend on one player, as in Stargell, to do everything for them. The 79 team had every player on the team contribute. Even the first game, a loss for the Pirates had plenty of decent play by the entire team after the 1st inning. Chuck Tanner uses his bullpen wisely and there's never a sense of doom and gloom the recent years has given us. These are not the Pirates I have gotten used to seeing the last decade and that's a good thing."
4,Excellent until the end,"Although I am an Orioles fan, and they lost this world series I enjoyed watching it in its entirety for the first time in almost 30 years. This was my favorite Orioles team. The quality of this product was excellent until the final two games, when the video had several problems. I was disappointed in the broadcast quality of game 7. Other than that, I highly recommend this product."
5,This is the Real Thing,"This one is the real thing.I own several other due diligence books and checklists, but this one is the best. It's the only one I use.It's thorough to a fault, but its also concise. It's not much more than a hundred pages and it includes a lot of street savvy.If you have a real deal you're working on this is the one to buy.You can even purchase a telephone consultation from the author if you run into any problems or have any questions. I ran into a tricky intellectual property problem so I thought I'd try it. I was able to call him up whip out a credit card and get some help right over the phone. Sahakian was helpful, friendly, approachable and helped me get the deal done.It's a nice package."
3,Disappointing,The content of the book is nothing new. I am disappointed in myself for spending the $12.00 knowing there probably wouldn't be any earth-shaking revelations. Buy this book used if you can. It wasn't worth it to me at full price. This book will be another donation to the public library.
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"I was very excited when I read the excerpts from this book. I was really looking forward to trying it out and seeing the results. While what Jorge writes makes a lot of sense and the exercises were very easy to do, I found the diet incredibly tough to stick to. Maybe it's just me, but I had a tough time eating the food that was on the menus. I was miserable by the end of the first week. I liked that you could mix and match the ""kick-off week"" menus - the meals were filling, but they just seemed bland. I was rather let down, but I'm going to give it another try and see if it's better the second time around."
2,"NOTHING NEW HERE ~ Sound ideas, but old news ~ Waste of $$$","I turned to this book for help losing the ""last 10 pounds"" and found it to be a waste of time. Cruise's plan involves some simple strength training and - SURPRISE ! - sensible eating. Not exactly new concepts. And the eating plan is absurdly detailed and restrictive, involving checking off ""boxes"" on ""eating cards."" Completely unrealistic and impractical for anyone with a real life. Cruise has many passionate followers, and some success stories - but don't think for a minute that the title is an accurate description of the plan. Here's the deal: Eat sensibly, do some kind of cardio activity three times a week, then toss in some simple weight training. THERE!! You just saved the price of the book."
2,This book is a waste of your time,"Everything in this book is tired, trite, and obvious. No busy person has time during his or her day to journalize ""eating."" My personal trainer reviewed the excercises and said that most are flawed for any number of physical and genetic reasons. The trite pictures of ""then"" and ""now"" are an insult to any reasonable person's intelligence."
2,More than 8 minutes . . .,"Just a warning - 8 minutes doesn't count warm up, stretching, or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise (something that I find really annoying and ineffecient!).I have not read Jeorge's book. I got the routine from an excerpt in O! I don't understand why he doesn't pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing - it's such a pain getting up and down, up and down. Plus, I feel like you lose that whole idea of ""no rest"". I'm sure I expend more calories to get up an down, but it's all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself.I have been following WW while I have been doing the 8m workout (more like 10-15 for me), and I have not lost one pound. I'll keep doing it, because it's probably better than nothing, but I'm not impressed so far (about 3 weeks)."
1,Get real! Drill down to the real stuff...,This diet is a real come-on. Weight loss is way to slow on this program. I'd be discouraged from the get go! What happens if I just can't get that 8 minutes in every day or even a percentage of the time? Give me the Fat Flush Plan any day over this wacko stuff. I need a life change weight loss plan that gives me results! I need to account for those foods I'm allergic to that are causing me to maintain fat and water weight. Fat Flush Plan doesn't rely on some weird morning verbal ritual to repeat. Who's to say that's the right message for me? Choose your weight loss and health plan carefully. Check out the real qualifications behind the authors.
4,Good book,"This was a good book with exercises that you can do in the comfort of your own home, or on the road (traveling)."
5,I've seen 'em all and this is the best,This book is great for a complete lifestyle change. Jorge is very motivating and he has the education and personal experience to back up his 8MM plan. After week one I've lost 3lbs but the best thing is how I feel. The book is an easy read too.
5,I'm Having Success!,"Eight Minutes in the Morning is full of smart advice on how to get control of emotional eating and live life in a healthier way. The excercise portion is easy to follow. It takes very little time, but you will feel the results. The food program is also easy to understand and follow. This book is very helpful for real people with busy lives that want to get fit, be truly happy and live a good life!"
4,give it a chance,"Ofcourse it takes more than just a diet and 8 minutes of exercise! But I think if you finish reading the book and listen to what is being said you will realize he does suggest a little more. This is a great way to jump start a weightloss program. I start my day at 4:00 am, spend 10-12 hours at work and gathering kids, then make dinner and the ususal evening routines.I think starting with 8 minutes a day and a guide to a healthy diet is a good start. I know that within in few weeks I will be more energetic and wanting to do more things. Great time of the year to ride bikes with the kids, rollarblade, etc. I dont think you heard him say do not do more than 8 minutes. Give it a shot!"
4,Seems Really Good,"I started this program a week ago and I have lost one pound which is good for me. The exercise, only being a few minutes every morning is quite bearable. Knowing that I am doing something good for my body and reaching my goals is inspiring. But knowing that I can do it for just those few minutes makes me work at them a little harder. There are nice daily inspirations and that keeps me on the right track. Also, that little 8 minutes every morning really DOES energize you all day!!I highly recommend this book to get you started even if you are not totally motivated at first. Thats how I was and then I thought, ""Come on, 8 minutes a day?, I can do that and I AM!!"" Now I AM MOTIVATED!"
4,The secret is in the teaspoon of oil,"I have done the exercises for a month while eating the way I normally did and that resulted in only a slight weight loss. I did not want to use his eating plan at first because when you read the amounts of food that you are allowed to eat it does not make you happy. Because I did not get the results I wanted by doing just the exercises, I tried his eating plan in addition and now I experience dramatic weight loss. The real secret of the program is in the teaspoon of oil that you should take with each meal as it suppresses your hunger."
5,8 minutes to a better lifestyle,"On the advice of my doctor I bought and have been using Jorge Cruise's 8 minutes in the morning. The book is written in everyday language and very easy to read and understand. The encouragement in the book is great and the exercises are so easy to follow. I like the eating cards that are included for use, helps me keep up with my food intake. I like the way the foods are catagorized for you. This makes using the food cards easier. I have lost 8lbs, 2"" in hips, 1"" in bust, arms and thighs in 2 weeks time. I feel better and have more energy. This book is helping me find a new and better way of living. The book has exercises laid out for 28 days. After the 28 days I will still be using this book on a daily basis, just start at day 1 and increase my reps and weights. I keep this book within reach all day so I can read inspirations, check my food intake and work on my exercises. I look forward to reaching my goal of 109lbs by March 2003."
2,Nice reading but not practical,"I found the information in this book to be interesting and somewhat useful reading. I have incorporated flax seed oil into my diet. Other than that, the exercises are good, but the diet is too hard to follow because it does not use common things you'll easily have in your kitchen. The web site is a total waste! I contacted them for help and/or menu substitution items, and never heard from them. I wouldn't recommend this book for someone looking for a simple program to follow to loose and maintain weight."
1,Don't buy,I was extremely disappointed in this book. There is a guarantee that you will lose 2 lbs a week. I followed the program for 3 weeks and lost no weight. When I attempted to find out about the 'guarantee' no one responds to my inquiries. Many other workouts would provide results - this one didn't and it doesn't follow up on its guarantee.
5,This program really does work!,"I am in my 22nd week of Jorge's weight training and excercise plan and am many pounds lighter and leaner than I have ever been at my current weight. Using the excercise plan and a modified eating plan, I tend to go higher protien and lower carb, I have taken 40 pounds off my frame and have less than 20 to go to meet my weight loss goal.There isn't any magic to it, that is true, it is a combination of lowered intake and increased energy output, but I am seeing real results for the first time of years of failed dieting and excercise. I have two other friends who are now in the program and am buying a copy for another friend as a gift."
3,It appears to be ok....,"I just ordered the book online, but I have been in the book store, looked through the book and liked the exercise portion. I've lost 40 pounds since Aug 2001 just eating right, but I also exercise DAILY (Mon - Sat). For me, trying to get strength training in is a challenge, so to devote 8 minutes each morning to it is really a great way for me to get it in. I've been doing the exercises this week that he recommends for each day, but I need the book so that I can alternate the types of exercises i'm doing each week. I think it's a great book for someone who is new to dieting and new to exercising. Focus on eating right and trying to move more...you'll feel better about yourself."
4,EIGHT MINUTES - BUT IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING,"Eight minutes - now, that is something that really appeals to someone who lives in fast-paced work world. No more strenuous workouts or time consuming and expensive trips to the gym. What I like about the book is the total combination of exercise, nutrition and lifestyle changes. While you may be prepared to devote eight minutes each morning to getting back in shape, what really needs to take place is a permanent change in your routine if the weight is to come off and stay off. Eight minutes of exercise will definitely not help if you continue to eat burgers and fries for lunch and munch-out on half a cheesecake for a bedtime snack. So, if readers are misguided into thinking eight minutes of exercise is all it takes, they should take into consideration, the nutritional information and suggestions for long-term lifestyle changes that are also mentioned in the book. Overall, I really like the concepts presented here and the book is one worth reading."
1,Nothing unusual here - save your money!,"I love reading books on health, healing, and fitness. But, this one does not offer anything different, unique or unusal except for a catchy title. I showed some of the exercises to my personal trainer - many of them, especially the ones on Jorge's web site are not demonstrated using the correct form. My trainer was amazed.Save your money, there are far better books out there by real professionals."
2,8 minutes in the morning-half the truth,"i purchased ""8 minutes int he morning"" by jorge cruise because i had heard such astounding remarks about it-such as ""so easy"" and ""just 8 minutes to a better you"". the fact is, if you read the book (don't get me wrong, it makes for good reading and some things about the book make it worth while to read)thinking you won't have to watch what you eat and that it will be easy to follow, think again! actually, according to the book you have to keep track of what you eat (and the calorie limit is very low-for example if you weigh about 150 lbs, you have to eat under 1400 calories a day! they constantly repeat in the book that you don't count calories, but you do have to keep track on cards! not as easy as it appears!"
4,Work out together,"My teenager and I are enjoying working out together in the morning. The attitude adjustment is a HUGE part of our overall life change, and we can already see progress in our bodies, our moods, and our minds. Thanks Jorge!"
1,do not waste your money,"I bought this book and followed it for a month, the excercises religiously plus 30 minutes of walking a day, kept my intake to under 2000 calories a day, I am 5'11 and weigh 205 lbs. I lost about five pounds. The key in this book is not the excercise, it is keeping your calorie count down to where you will loose weight. The book is misrepresented, the title suggests excercise and mentions nothing about the diet. If you can keep your calorie count down to what major charts say anywhere in the internet, the book adds nothing extra at ll. The excercises are a simple combination of excercises you can get from any website for free. The genuine people in this industry loose big time when cons write books like this and sell them."
3,Starvation mode...,"Of course you'll lose weight if you eat 1200 calories or fewer a day. During the first week of the plan, you are allowed even fewer than 1200 calories, although the author doesn't give an exact number. As someone who already exercises five days a week, I couldn't live with an eating plan like this.The great part of the book (earning it three stars) is the weight training. I've incorporated morning weight lifting into my exercise plan and it really jump starts my day.Don't buy this book for the eating plan unless you are willing to strictly limit your calorie intake. Do buy this book if you are interested in starting a weight training program. It's great for beginners."
1,Don't bother,"This book was a major disappointment. It looks, reads, and feels like a vanity press production. Lots of those before and after pictures of family members that can be posed with the belly slump and two minutes later with erect posture and tight abdominals. Pages of semi blank forms for journal keeping. Each day has half pages devoted to pop psychology and fluff regarding weight issues and dieting. The nutrition advice and food lists are definately not for anyone doing low carb. The exercises with light dumbells are being featured in half of the womens magazines on the rack by the checkout. If you really want a guide to working out physically don't bother with this one."
5,A weight loss program I can do!,"I was so happy to find this book. I have just turned 40 and my weight is gradually adding up by 5-10 pounds every year over the past 5 years. I have tried eating smaller more frequent meals,gyms, walking, aerobics but with a 2 1/2 year old toddler I just don't have the time to do all these things consistently. 8MM works for me because I can do it at home, first thing in the morning with my little 'helper' counting and checking off the sets! The instructions are clear and concise and doing only two different exercises a day works for me! I am really enjoying planning out my meals and found it only took me 3 days to adjust to the change of meal organization and I rarely feel hungry."
1,Fluff,"This book is a waste of time, money, and paper.The diet he recommends is completely at odds with anything any real dietician would recommend.The exercise program is lame - 8 minutes is not enough to do anything real - only an optical illusion.To get any real benefit you need to elevate your heart rate a bit (depending on your desired results).The only good thing in this book is that it gives a day-by-day exercise plan: this keeps it interesting and varied...."
3,too vague,"While the premise of this book is a good one, Jorge Cruise assumes everyone can just plow into 4 sets of 12 repetitions each without spending any time on how to work up to this level of exercise. In particular, there is no explanation spent on how to guage the amount of weight to start lifting.This book is not for someone who has been inactive for awhile.I found that the Strong Women series by Dr. Miriam Nelson was much more helpful."
3,Daily Discipline Made Easy,"I enjoy following these simple but effective daily exercises. The book makes it easy to keep on a weekly exercise program by following the two featured exercises each day. I'm not impressed with the diet plan or advice, but the exercise regimen makes the book a good buy. As an inspirational author myself, of NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL (Judson Press), I like to spend some quiet time in the mornings on daily Scripture readings. I can add these exercises and still get to work on time!"
2,8 minutes a day to lose fat? i don't think so,"I think everybody that says that you can lose weight by doing 8 mins strength exercise a day is a liar. Strength training is mainly anaerobic so you don't burn any fat. In addition, even if it was aerobic you wouldn't burn any fat, since you start burning signicant amount of fats after the first 20mins. So, if you follow the diet you will probably lose weight since it's restricted in calories, but don't be fooled in that you can lose weight simply by exercising 8 mins a day, no matter what type of exercise. To put it simple, a pound of fat is 3500 calories. In order to lose 1 pound of fat simply by exercise you would have to walk or run 35 miles a week. In addition if you do proper exercise, warm-up, stretching, exercise, dtretchign cooldown, you would need much more than 8 mins. The only good thing I can say is that 8mins is better than nothing even though byitself won't have any beneficial benefits."
4,"Fun, thought-provoking","This collection of short stories is a fun, sometimes funny, thought-provoking read. I especially loved the last two stories by Ana Lydia Vega: ""Three Love Aerobics"" and ""ADJ, Inc."" The stories are like mind aerobics--they make you think and stretch basic ideas. Also interesting is the use of narration to show differing points of view on subjects like love and marriage.I don't know much about Puerto Rican writers, but the introduction gives a fairly good briefing. On the whole, this book was a great introduction to Puerto Rican female authors."
4,Factual and Interesting,"The author did her homework in digging up the stories from the past and in interviewing those who still retain the knowledge of Marietta's colorful and extensive ghostly history. Especially helpful were the pictures, maps and addresses, which allow ghost hunters to plan, view and sometimes schedule tours of these interesting structures and their ethereal inhabitants."
2,not the same,"while these are the only one I have found.They are NO where near the Quality, of what they used to be !the metal that forms the window glass clamp is so thin it will not even stay on the glass.another example of inferior Chinese Crap"
3,Tedious,"Could have been great, but needed more time in development. It's core gameplay is awesome, but fighting is awful, and the side missions are stupid and boring. Rent only."
3,Specifics,"Clearly this is not a game for little kids, due to the bloodshed and assassination plotting. The game mechanics are very well put together, although there are a few glitches. The graphics are very nice looking. The story is unique, and good, but mediocre voice acting. The gameplay is very interesting to start with, but later it becomes repetitive. (Find info, assassinate, repeat.) Although there are other things you can do like ""Save the Citizen"" there's not much to do besides the story line. Bottom line: Good story. I don't recommend buying this game new, but I do recommend to play it if you get the time/chance, although its not high on the list."
2,Stale,"I was not impressed with this game when I played it and now I'm replaying it because I bought Revelations and Wal-Mart and got this game. So here is why this game is not that great:1. Too big for it's own good - Half of the game time you will spend is traveling to extremely far away places. The game wants you to walk buy enemies, but that takes up far too much time and is just plain boring.2. I know its Assassin's Creed but it is far too repetitive. Go here and kill this guy. Travel for 30 minutes and stab that guy in the exact same way.3. The start of the game was bad - They give you all of his moves at the start of the game, then they take them away and you have to get them back, just not a good idea.4. I didn't like Altair's character in this one. If you play the other games you'll see why the characters just do not matchup."
3,Almost there,"Assassins Creed could have been a great game, but a few details made it just an average title.The plot is very good, so is the gameplay, but the missions are very repetitive. Also, I don`t know why would someone think that beggars that annoy while you are trying to play would be a good idea."
2,Honesty!,"I bought this game back in 2011 at a local gamestop because my cousin use to tell me how great the series was plus gamestop was offering it used for like $10 bucks so I said what the hell I will give it a try. The graphics I noticed straight away as being good especially if you press the (Square) button during the movie scenes to get a different angle. The controls i did find difficult and the game did have the same things reoccurring in every level. Sneaking around the town finding people, climbing buildings and then establishing a map of the town. Really I wanted this game to be good and tried to like it, but it just wasnt my type of game got old quick, controls gave me issues, got pissed I couldn't skip dialogue during some of the longer movie scenes.Good things about this game were the grpahics and the combo moves you could use on your enimies."
2,video game,The game it self I guess it a good game just not a game for me I got it to see what the hype was about but it didnt compare to the games I like playing
3,Cracked game case.,I thought I purchased this game new. It was not sealed. If it was used no problem except for the crack in the top of the case.
4,Overhyped-but still great!,"This is an action/adventure title in the truest sense of the word. There is certainly the stealth component in there, but it's not quite a prominent as the climbing, riding, and swordplay. My PS3 version has run flawlessly. I've not had any freezing, pop-ins, or frame rate issues. The environments are truly something to behold. The gameplay and controls work well. I wouldn't say it's the game of the year, but it definitely ranks right up there in the top 10 for 2007. I think, as with Halo 3, that most folks were mildly let down after all of the hype surrounding this game (game reviewers included). I can't think of anything that I really dislike about the game, but it's not quite as innovative as Ubisoft claimed it would be. I guess my one gripe is that the scifi twist occurred at the beginning of the game when it should have happened at the end. That would have made for a much more stunning and mind blowing experience."
2,"Boring, overhyped","There are a lot of things that I don't like about this game. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that the graphics are pretty nice, but not stunning. Well, I guess I would say that I like that you can climb just about anything and that is cool, but the cool stops there for me. I found this game very repetitive, not just in game play such as the saving a citizen always being the same or pickpocket being the same, or eavesdropping always being the same, but just getting to the point where you can actually perform an assassination is the same. This game felt like work to me, and I don't need my games feeling like work. Also, it's very predictable once you get about an hour into it.If you haven't done so already, get Uncharted. I found Uncharted to be one of the best games I've ever played. It was fun, had great dialog (voice over work was very nice), a great story, great gameplay, decent AI, and is even fun to replay. I think it is superior to AC in the graphics department too."
3,This game is really a 3.5 out of 5... maybe 3,"It's hard for me to rate this game. lots of likes, and lots of dislikes.. I'm confused.Likes:-Graphics-Ability to climb anything and complete ability to interact with any building.-Helping out the people in the hood, so they'd help you out when you escape through their hood.-Stabbing people from behind.Dislikes:-""A"" bug ... meaning.. the games awesome ways of freezing up and preventing you from playing the game... meaning.. you'll have to restart your PS3. ERRRRRRRRRR!!!!- Missions are repetitive.- Voice overs are lame and generic.So there you go... a very very confusing review.. well to me at least because even though i experience a good time... i still feel like it doesn't belong to stay in my collection."
5,great game,If this isn't next gen im not sure what to look for!? Graphics top notch i believe some of the people that review this game are simply fps addicts ...Which don't get me wrong i love Fps but this takes a different approach to gaming in the same way drake uncharted did...Its nice to have something new ..Im about a game making me think and this game will do that....just buy it its a nice game!!!
3,Good game but...,"Was a bit disappointed that when this game arrived, first, it was not in correct packaging, just a generic GameStop box - so it had obviously been bought second hand before being sold on Amazon - and then it had no instruction booklet in it - they had been no mention of this pre-purchase. However, the disk works fine, game works fine, so not a massively big deal."
4,I guess,"its decent but the gameplay is too cluster and annoying.too much guards running around, you can't even go a minute without being chase by guards."
2,"Boring, plain and simple","This game gets old FAST! It was mentioned in a great lengthy review earlier. It starts off really cool, and I was really excited. However....All the cities look the same. You do the same things over and over. You will soon realize you can pretty much kill any amount of guards who attack you, thereby completely killing the necessity or need to remain stealthy. I wont go in to detail, because others already have. It is fun for the first two cities maybe, then it just gets boring. I made it to Damascus, the 3rd city, and I stopped playing it for the reasons above. Disappointing.I have also had some glitches, when in the transitioning state (really the level load state, it has stalled out and failed to load the new mission). Required a restart."
2,Boring,"This game gets boring real quick, Hopefully the developers will put a little more thought into the actual game play than the graphics next time around. My advice, rent it."
3,great game...tough in areas...,"This is a great game but you really have to master your moves...I was coasting along until near the end...had I not taken a break and come back to work on my counter-moves, I probably wouldn't have finished! The game's tasks are very repetitive after a while. For a 2007 game, it is great...for 2009/2010, it is average. I finished the game and did enjoy it...still can't figure out how I killed the last guy, but who cares...I'm ready for Creed 2...should be fun as well...get the game and dedicate some time...it's enjoyable!"
4,Great Game a little too short but still a great game to play,"the shipping was great it came right on time and it took my son 17 days to pass it. it was really easy because there are some things that you repeat, but sometime you do get into it and it really fun game if you like killing bad guys. So i rated a 4/5 I think it could been bit more better, but let see how part 2 is"
3,Assassins Creed ps3,"This is a fun game, but there is a major glitch in the games programming. At first I thought my game disc was defective, then I looked it up online and found that others had experienced the glitch. It only happened to me about once every six hours of play, the main character freezes and you can only move the camera. To fix the problem the only option is to do a complete reboot of the system which makes you start again at your last save point. I am writing this to let people be aware of the glitch. Besides this glitch I found the game to be fun and it has an interesting story."
3,Innovative,"The first time you play this game you are going to love the immersion, the cities are full of life, and the main character has great attitude, but there are several problems that hurt the expirience 1) the AI is really dumb 2) technical issues like clipping and pop-ins 3) every mission is the same 4) investigations do not affect the outcome of your goals 5) zero replay valueConclusion == Rent it."
4,GOOD GAME,"This game was everything I hoped for minus a few details, when I first saw this game advertised on Tv I thought it was excellent, and for some reason I got it until a month ago. First of all the graphics are mind blowing, besides METAL GEAR 4, I think the graphics are great, the game si ok, very entertaining but repetitive at some times, you get to do missions on the citys to locate you targets, but the missions are always the same in every city or location, but one you get your target it gets very fun to play, especially if you want to do the stealth kills wich I only did two of them. The story is excellent although youy get to imagine the end of the game, with just one exception.So in resume the game is great if you like games like SPLINTER CELL and MG4, but with a sword.Hope this helps."
4,OMG the best game of 2006,The day this game came out everyone was silence. the best game to hop from building to building and jump on enemies to slash them. OMG just so much to name. you go from horsey back riding to slaying big bosses. so much to do here and the graphics was great. get this game if you looking for a long adventure fulled with sequels.
2,Seriously?,"Okay... the game itself was fun for the 2-3 hours that I played it. After sometime I realized, where are my trophies? Then I found out there are not trophies for Assassin's Creed! I KNOW! It seems a little harsh to give a game bad rating over a small issues like trophies but, COMON! I do play for trophies because it gives me a sence of accomplishment and lets other players know of my accomplishments. I understand that 10 years ago this stuff didnt exist, it's not 10 years ago. I can't play a game without trophies and for that, Assassin's Creed recieved a bad rating. Now, if youre a player who does not care much for the trophy/achievement system, then based off the 2-3 hours I actually played, I would recommend this game. But if youre looking for trophies, i'd look somewhere else... obviously."
1,"Great story, poor controls","I agree with everyone that this is a good game, but the controls are horrible! This is one of the flaws, the other being the fact that the game seems repetitive. After playing the game, it almost feels like you want to view all the cut scenes and be done with it. I give this game 1 star for story and deduct 4 starts for s... controls as well as every level feeling the same. I notice the same control issue in Assassin's Creed II, but it is not as bad. Ubi should follow games like Uncharted or Modern Warfare for examples of good controls, even though these games are not very similar (Uncharted being the more similar to Assassin's Creed controls.)"
3,Falls short,"The storyline in this game had promise, but the way the game is played/designed led to confusion. I eventually lost interest."
3,"Love the story, enjoyed the game","While it's a bit tedious is also a lot of fun to do all does building climbing and for the price I think it's worth it for anyone who is willing to get into the Assassin's creed lore. The story is really good and intriguing, in the vein of 'lost', it leaves you with a lot of questions that are to be answered in the following games."
2,Repetition. Repetition,"Do you like collecting hundreds of hidden items for no reason other than to brag (without the help of trophies) to you friends? Buy this game. Do you enjoy only having 3-4 different types of missions that you can repeat over and over again with no increase in difficulty or challenge? Then do I have a game for you. Do you enjoy searching for and climbing towers only to jump back down? This game is for you! You can do this activity about 50 different times throughout different cities. Do you enjoy having NPCs solicit you for spare change? Fantastic!! Any time you walk anywhere you have women following you around telling you they are sick and need money.Realistically, though, this game takes the first hour of gameplay and repeats it seven or eight times. I only made it through because I was expecting to find something neat or new. I guess I was wrong. While this game certainly has some interesting game mechanics, you can really get away without using most of them."
2,Walk Slowly,"Okay, so visually stunning and semi cool story but the gameplay is half awesome, half completely retarded. The alternate name should be ""Walk Slowly"". You spend half the game walking at a snails pace trying to avoid having people bump into you so guards don't come after you. That is literally half the game and it's retarded. You'll finish a mission and have to spend 20 minutes walking like a turtle hoping no one bumps you to get it saved.It's as fun as it sounds. Whatever designer thought that was a good idea should be fired. It completely ruins what would otherwise be a great game."
2,Definitely not 4.5 stars,"I was pretty disappointed in this game. I was lucky enough to buy it after the 2nd game had already come out, so it only cost me a couple of bucks, but it really is a pretty mediocre game. The graphics are awesome, but all you really do is climb towers, get in a couple of fights, run, and assassinate your primary target for that particular mission. You will keep doing these things on every single level...I was only able to do it until I reached the 3rd mission and realized that all that changes is the city you are in, so I shut it off and stopped playing. I was also expecting puzzle type scenarios (Prince of Persia style), but found none. If you have no better alternative and you need to rent something, I guess this is ok, but definitely not something you need to buy."
3,"Great Concept, Mediocre Game","The concept of this game was brilliant, unfortunately the game itself is repetitive and suffers from very boring (vanilla) controls and poor camera angles. It's also a very close ended game (not open ended).I was hopping for a game between Theif Dark Project and Oblivion. I got neither. I also beat it in a week with little effort so it's not terribly long either."
2,Eye candy,"Assassins creed is a very pretty game, But relly thats all it is. Yes it looks amazing and it really shows off the PS3's grafix ability. But thats all it does. The game is so repeditive that it quickly turns boring.Rent this but dont buy it."
1,Another EA mistake,See my review of ME II. This game stinks if you can't figure out how touse the controller. I also bought all of the guide's. Guess what? They don'taddress the controller problems at all.
5,Spectacular Game!,"One of the best games I've played. The environments are massive and highly interactive. You can climb almost anything, everything and everyone reacts to you and your actions. Fantastic! Lots of game play time. Excellent storyline."
4,Entertaining,"alot of repetition, but it is an entertaining game. It takes some time to do all of the items and quests."
2,Not what I expected...,"Ok, I am really into the whole ""professional assassin"" and ""kind-of medieval times"" kind of thing. I had really high expectations with this game, since it is very popular. However, it got pretty boring (in my opinion) in about 5 minutes and it did not stop being so. This game has a really good concept but without much action or challenges. What is really good is its images, the big world one can walk around in. However, one cannot do much with it. It is just that, a pretty big world. And the action... One can kill somebody without much stealth and still end the game..."
3,"Too Repetitive, Too Long.","Same towns over and over again, What makes it worse is that you have to walk their each time.Voices are bad, and focus too much on the accents making it hard to understand what the plot is about.The missions dont have any uniqueness either."
5,still the best,it may not be as flashy as the newer games but it has a lot of substance. i'd say assassin's creed is the hardest considering that altair does not have many of the skills/weapons of ezio or conor. call him a novice if you want but altair is still the most bad-ass assassin. have fun stabbing templars.=)
3,fine~,"Maybe the game is too old, the time when I played it is about a month ago, I didn't really like it......"
4,tons of fun,"This game is a blast and others think so too considering its"" greatest hits"" status... tons of fun cool graphics and excellent shipping time"
4,solid title,"Not much to say other than solid fun, great use of history, and great concept for gameplay. I havent sat in front of the tv without looking at the clock in sometime now, but time flies with this game.For $20, cant beat it!"
5,Classic Assassin's Creed ~ Must Have,"One of son's favorite games. Recently got him PS3 for his b-day and wanted to make sure he had some games to go with it, as you know they add up quick so threw a few cheaper titles in there as well, this was one of them because I knew it was a favorite he no longer had. He really enjoys the rooftop fighting and perpectives of being up top and jumping down, thats all I really know because he talks about it a lot! So, one of a 12 year old boys favorite games, must have, definitly a greatest hit and plays great on the PS3!"
4,Love it,"For me it is a 4 stars game. Fun, but I find it a bit short of missions, namely the nine missions are the same thing and although it is the object of the game I think it could add more points in each mission. Highlight the quality of the architecture of cities, that's wonderful. Altair needs more weapons.But to be the I of the series is fine. I'm playing the second and waiting for November 3rd."
4,Pretty good but easy,"This game was a little easier than I thought it was going to be. You just follow the clues or hints on the map and do your tasks as an assassin. Escaping seemed too easy though. You can run 3 feet away behind a wall or bench, on a roof, or between people, and you're free... The battles are not hard from what I've seen so far. And once you've completed the biggest part of your mission assassinating someone and the town goes on alert, you can just ""blend"" in and walk very slowly to escape. I think they made it too easy. Overall entertaining but I was really playing this to get to the game I hear is even better, Assassin's Creed 2"
4,"Good, solid game for the PS3","I've been in the PS3 world for about a year now, and this is easily one of the better ones I've seen or played so far. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the gameplay is seamless and fun (although a bit repetitive), and the storyline is intriguing.After glancing at a REALLY long review on Amazon, I'd say that most of what the guy said is probably true and not worth retelling here. All that being said though, this is a budget-priced game a couple of years old now that has a lot to offer for the casual gamers, and I'm glad that I gave it a shot - a nice addition to the library."
2,Redundant,"The first couple hours of playing this game are fairly exciting. I think it is fairly unique in it game play and controls, But........ After the first couple hours you start to realize that your next task at hand is almost exactly like the previous one. It starts to be really boring after you realize that you're doing the same thing over and over again. I rented the game and stopped playing it because it began to be boring. I also had trouble with it freezing a couple times. Could have been my console but I have never had troubles with any other games. This game might be worth renting. I always like renting games before buying them because I am picky about what games I like and dislike. Overall very blah."
3,Okay...,"Glitches galore. This game has some bad freezing problems for starters.The graphics are great. Gameplay is good.Missions are really weak, climb a building,pickpocket, listen to a conversation... over and over and over... Play one stage, play them all."
3,"fun, gets old fast",I bought it and played for a few hours and loved it but it did not catch me enough to have gone back since. A bit repetitive.
1,I wish I knew if the game was fun...,"I've heard a lot about this game and rather than buy a PS3 or XBox 360 just for this game, I went for the PC version. Buyers BEWARE: if you are purchasing the PC version, please check the Ubisoft website at[...] for system requirements; the game will install fine on Windows 7 but the video will lag unless you have a Nvidea or ATI Radeon video card (I have an integrated driver in my laptop). So while the game looks great I couldn't play it."
2,Be murderer is incredible,This game brings a lot of violence if ... But it is one of the most recommended at stake in this category ... not play over the Internet but if you jugandolo Fun as it is longATT: fans of videogames
1,i agreed with everyone else,"Everyone is right about this game. It does get boring quick. The graphics are ouystanding, but thats about it."
1,Freezes on the PS3 format,"This is a great game, however it comes from a terrible company. I say terrible because they apparently did not even test game through on the PS3 format before releasing it. This game freezes, glitches, locks up your system untill you have to manually cut off the power before getting it up again, and it is not just my experience, go to the ubisoft boards and see the 79 - yes i said 79 page thread on the forums about freezing problems under the assassins creed section. Refund? Nope. Will the store give you a refund? Nope. Since when have you been able to return opened media?DONT BUY THIS GAME FOR THE PS3. I promise you will be as angry as I am. It is an awesome game, but it is unplayable on this system."
1,The seller sent me a broken game.,I have played Assassin's Creed (the game I tried to purchase from this seller) several times in the past. Most missions of the game consist of assassinating nine men. The game would freeze up in the exact same place every time. The first half of the game was fine but the second half was impossible to reach.
3,groundhog day,"Simply put, its an awesome game from a graphics/viewing standpoint, but it gets old after a few hours. A rental, certainly not a buy. trust me."
3,Short and sweet review,"The first thing you do when you pop this game in your PS3 is say ""WOW!"". It is absolutley beautiful. The controls and camera are excellent. Easy to learn, so it's a great game, right? Sadly, no. This game is absolutly a huge let down. From the first city on you do the same things OVER AND OVER AND OVER. This is a good game to impress a friend or family member, but don't reccomend to gamers becuase this game is one of the most redundent games ever. Everything seems fun the first time around, but then you realize you will do the same exact thing in a different spot a hundred or so times. I still think the series has potential considering the graphics the amazingly huge free roaming maps and the controls. Even the story was good. If Activision gets there head out of their butt they can turn this into something amazing but until then, 2 of 5 stars for fun factor."
4,Something different!,"I like this game. Its different. It gets harder and you are free, you can do whatever you want. I love that about this game. the graphics are breath taking. I recomend this game to people who like doing their own thing when they play every once in a while."
2,"Fun game at first, but gets old real quick.","The first 2-3 hours of gameplay are great, jumping from building to building, riding a horse through open fields, hiding from soldiers, etc. Then you realize the major flaw of the game: repetition. You do the exact same thing city after city after city, which gets old really quick. It actually becomes very tedious towards the end, making it feel more like a chore then a game. I'm guessing most high reviews for this game were written by people after only a few hours of playing...I doubt they would leave the same reviews now. Its obvious this title was rushed because it was a launch title for the PS3. The developers spent more time on the visuals then they did the actual content of the game. I recommend renting this game for a week, not buying it."
3,Repetitive gameplay,"With all the mixed opinions about Assassin's Creed - some said they loved it, some said they thought it was repetitive. I decided to try it anyway. Well, I found it repetitive, and I don't really play it anymore. There are like 9 missions and in each mission, you need to accomplish the same set of objectives in a free-form fashion: you go around stealing from people, eavesdropping, fending off guards from citizens, collecting points from taking down ""elite guards"" that are littered around the world, and finally when you gather enough information you will proceed with assassinating the primary target for that mission.The presentation - sound and graphics - are amazing. However, I would not rate the game purely on those aspects. I would recommend going for Assassin's Creed 2 directly (Skip AC 1), as I heard that game is much better."
4,PS3 on the move towards greatness!,"Assassins Creed lives up to the expectations. The gameplay is exactly like the game trailers that we've seen for the past year. The graphics are beautiful and the game will surprise you in it's story line. It is a creative twist on a great idea that I'm sure will bring a sequel.Graphically this game is awesome. The controls take awhile to get used to, but if you've played Prince Of Persia you will catch on pretty quickly. The cities are huge and the views are awesome. When you first start this game you will want to show it to everyone!The game play is exactly what is expected, you can pretty much do what you want, but you have to be careful. Yes you can mindless kill soldiers, but the game won't stand for innocent citizens being killed.I have experienced freezes in the game, which does make it ""annoying"", but does not make the game any less desirable."
3,Not My Niche.,"I'm one of those people who need to start a story from the beginning. Since the recent Assassin's Creeds were so popular, I figured I try and get into the groove of it. I wanted to start with the first one and it just wasn't that fun to me. I'm sure the new ones are much better, but I just can't bring myself to get the latest ones until I know the story from the beginning. But that's just me."
4,Addicting,"The first assassin's creed is not as much better than the second one, but I quite like this one. It gets addicting after you play for a while. I'm thinking about playing the whole series. Assassins creed 1,2 are really fun I recommend anyone to get it."
3,assassins creed,The game is very good a bit long on travel time and repition on solving some clues. The game has a good story line to go with the action. I played Assassin's 2 first and that took alot out of the enjoyment of the first one.
2,"Beware - bad controls, repetitive play","While the premise of this game is actually pretty good, bad controls and repetitive game-play pretty much ruin this title and the whole series.For some reason, the developers seem to be unaware that there are other buttons on the controller besides R1, L1, and the four buttons (on the PS3). When I have to contort my hand so that I can hold R1, press the O button and use my thumb on the right joystick all just to do basic game mechanics, this is a sure sign of a bad design.Things that make this game really suck:No adjustable difficulty.No remapping of controls.Using the same buttons over and over again for too many functions.Repetitive missions.Bad responsiveness.I really wanted to like this game, but the flaws are so bad, it winds up being one of the worst I've played. And it's really unfortunate because the idea behind it is great."
4,Loving it,"Loved playing this game when i rented it a while back finally thought to buy it cuz its cheaper. Am now grinding through with bags under my eyes, enjoying it. But the game actions can get a bit repetitive."
1,Most frustrating game I have ever played!,"In a nutshell, this game sucks! The controls are so terrible, the missions are all the same, and the camera angle constantly has no idea where to look. In other words when your getting attacked by 6 or 7 guards you cannot see what you are even fighting, and thanks to the control layout, cannot fight back anyway.The game is also very boring. Everything is the same!"
4,Great Game,"Assassins Creed is a great game. The story is good, and has a nice little twist at the end. It is the most 'organic' game I have played to date. The character interaction with the crowd, his environment, and parkour just works. The game actually lasts about 6 hours, but then they do a bunch of repetition on the various quests (informant, pickpocket, eavesdrop, interrogate) to draw the game out... however, you can skip most of the repetition to get to the end."
3,Too short,Game is too repetitive and too short. Although visually it is really cool. That's why I gave it 3 stars.
2,Decent with NO replayability,"I have been awaiting this games release for YEARS now, and all I have to say is cool game, but not worth more than a rental. This game was pretty cool the first time through, except EXTREMELY repeditive. I won't ruin it, but there are basicly 9 long ""stages"" to the game where you do the exact same thing in 3 different cities 3 different times with possibly the WORST ending to any video game I have ever played, and I'm 21 and have been button-mashin' since about 5 yrs old, that's a lot of games. Oh, and if you like playing your current collection of many online and expansive games more than just one sit-down, don't buy this. I guarantee your of this game will sit somewhere collecting dust for the rest of your life once you've beaten it and seen the horribly retarded ending. I would recommend renting this game though, that is the only reason it makes above a 1 star."
2,"lame target lock, lame fight zones","The game is fun in many ways, but....The UI picks your targets. So if you are fighting a group of ten. And you put one guy down, well logic would suggest you wax him. But the UI will switch targets for no reason what so ever. And he gets back up.The other issue is the boss fights, the npc can leave the ZONE and you cant. But the target lock is still on that npc. And If you get pushed out of the Zone cause of the lame lack of actual player control during fights. you auto die.Basically the computer moves around Altair during fights. you can have very limited control to who you target and where you want to go.That is the problem with this game from the beginning. Is that you really don't have fine control of your Altair and by the end you really start to get frustrated at the lame moves the UI decides Altair should do."
3,wayyy tooo slowww!!!,"I really wanted this game. I bought Uncharted and assasins creed...First I started playing uncharted and I couldnt stop playing it till the end...then, I started playing assasins and...wow...amazing graphics, amazing sound but its too damn slow!!!. I forced my self to play it like for 2 hours to see if it gets better but, wrong..."
3,All Hype,"This game is all hype. When I bought it, I thought it would be the greatest game I have ever played. It is probably one of the worst.First, the good: The graphics are amazing; they totally draw you into the story. The storyline is also good, it wouldn't make a bad movie. The sound is great, except for the fact that there are only a few different voices (but that is to be expected.) One of the most impressive things is the way the movement controlls feel so natural.And the bad: The missions feel like the same thing over and over again. The fighting controlls are just pressing the same attack button and counter buttons. The way the crowd AI works is ok, but sometimes gaurds will attack you for no reason. Overall everything is just so routine, I am forcing myself to finish the game. I DO NOT RECCOMEND BUYING THIS GAME!"
2,This game is so Repetitive!!!!,"Just wanna say a few words: This game sucks....if u like sword fighting go rather buy a Prince of persia or something like that...Although i like the graphics and the scenery etc...but this game is very repetitive..its climbing the same tower 1000 times...doing same prep for assassinating a person...30 times...using the same stealth techniques 100 times...I general..the game has the same exact overall layout...that u repeat over 15 times to kill 15 people and not 9 that are usually heared...i really did not want to spoil the surprise but i suggest u not buy this game...the game itself is good like i like the fight moves and stuff but its so repetitive...i was even tired of people in the game givin the same speeches again and agian....DONT BUY THIS GAME...THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY..even if u wanna buy let the price come down..i promise u, u r not gonna like it.."
2,Pure smoke!,"Ubisoft sold us smoke, this game is not what it was supposed to be, not even close... lately I've been wondering what is Ubisoft's problem with so many bad games (if not all) for the PS3, take Haze for example and not developing Splinter Cell for PS3, among other examples.Back to the Assassin's Creed, by the time it was released had amazing graphics, not anymore comparing it with Drake's Fortune or GTA 4.The missions are repetitive and doesn't get any harder.The worst is that the game is very short, one week and it's done. The whole game could had been one long chapter of other game.The best thing is the history (but could had been better).Overall rating: 5.5 out of 10.Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is a much better game, not to mention GTA 4 or MGS 4."
2,review,"Wasn't as much fun as I thought it would be. The player doesn't have control, too automatic. All show."
4,Good game,"Is very life like, and the scenarios are so real. It takes quiet some time to load sometimes. You need to keep track of the story and objectives because if you dont, sometimes you may get lost and forget what was next.But is a pretty good game overall.It was worth buying and considering I bought it used it was even a better deal."
2,Gets old quick.,"I play a lot of games so I will be honest here: the game is pretty fun at first. You do a lot of sneaking and ""death from above"" moves. However, the story itself is too confusing for its own good and the game gets pretty repetitive. If you own a PS3, please save your money for a game like Metal Gear Solid 4, which is totally worth it."
3,"Must play, gets old quick","Im sure its been said a lot, but this game is boring. Its innovative though, the missions are really inventive, but the game in it self is a really good idea and fun for 5 hours. Its just that once you get used to the graphics and the cool gameplay, it becomes a chore to beat. Thats it, you do the same stuff over and over and over.I think everyone should give it a play, its really fun for a while and the whole idea behind the game is new and very beautiful to look at. But there it is, all this innovative gameplay is VERY repetitive. Also, there is no skill level to the game, anyone who has played this game for a year is just as good at it as someone that played it for a week."
3,rent before buying,"Okay, so some people really seem to love this game, I am not one of those people. I though just based on looks the scenery was amazing but the gameplay was repetitive and rather boring. Anybody thinking about buying this one should play it first before plopping down any cash."
3,Assassins Creed ps3,Overall the game is good but becomes repetitive but this flaw was corrected on it's sequel.
1,Don't spend your money on this game,This is worst action game of the year..game is boring and dull.. similar task over and over and over..and game freezes a lot.And you still decided to buy this game anyway DO NOT download new patch or something when you insect disc in ps3.. this only make disc error messege and can't play game at all.
1,Please Ubi. Make a good game.,Ubisoft you have become so bland and.. well horrible over the past 2 years. I don't understand why your stock is priced so high and I don't understand why any fool would buy into your company after a stock split. Maybe you guys have been using too much nectar. Yet another bomb. Vegas 2 was also trash.
1,Not as expected .......... disappointment,"this game was very disappointment to me , the story of the game not as you will expect to be , the game play is very boring very quiet the action on the game is minimal the special move of the main character is the same it will not change or upgrated so you will feel you doing the same thing over and over , the graphics is normal , i cant say no more , there is alote of grate game on ps3 so dont waist your time for this one ......."
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played. It is very boring and repetitve. If I had played it when it first came out, I might feel differently. But playing the game now (Dec. 2012), made it very boring. I bought it thinking that I would buy all 3 Assassin's Creed games and play them in order. After playing 10 hours on this one, I don't think I'm going to buy the other 2. The graphics and gameplay might have been cutting-edge in 2007. But now it feels like going back to PS2."
3,"Like Oblivion, you WONT like Assassins Creed","After seeing the reviews for this game, I decided to give it a chance, I love role playing games especially Oblivion IV for PS3, from what I read in the reviews the game seemed to be similar to Oblivion in the sense you had full world play (so it says), After waiting a month, I sold some of my old game to buy this game, let me say, I am very disappointed, the game is very much scripted in its responses and actions do follow a timeline, you have to complete the tasks in order and if one is not complete you cannot start another.If you like Oblivion IV you will not like this game..."
5,Great book!,This book is great for people searching a computer education. It has it all. What's a virus? What is a network? Internet? Operating system? It has all the basic information about a computer. A great reference book. The CD is also great. It let's you see things how they really are. Beginners will love this book. I recommend it to everyone.
2,"Not very good, information is missing.",The other edition was better. This one only has more pictures but not the same information. The CD is a big help but this is the only good thing about this book.
2,My Peeps Won't...,"Surprisingly, my keets won't touch the stuff. I have Linnies and Budgies and this is a throw-away item. I will not be buying again."
1,yummie but garbage for your bird,"While birds love these, I would not make these a part of your birds diet. READ THE INGREDIENTS. Yeah...I knew you would change your mind...if you love your bird. these are like giving your birds a candy bar everyday. Give your bird fresh fruit and veggies and healthy cereals instead and you will double, YES DOUBLE, your bird's lifespan."
3,A little too tall for some cars,Works Fine with my honda element but My wife has low profile tires and a sportier car and we had to raise with her regular jack to fit this under it.
2,weak,Used this jack for 2 weeks at work when it suddenly broke at the extension screw I believe because of the low grade metal used to make it
3,Good for the money,Decent. Works. Build quality is good for the price - just don't expect a real precision piece of equipment.The jack has been reliable so far.
4,Worked Good For Me,"I bought this to jack up a small cabin to re-level it after some sinking over the years. Had no problems doing what I needed to do. If you're buying it to jack up a car, a car is not really what these jacks were designed for."
3,Nice,"While a nice little bracelet, it is not adjustable and is a bit too large for my wrist making the clasp pop open at times. Too round, needs to be more oval to fit the writst better."
3,Decent.,"The bracelet is a lot smaller and more delicate than the picture leads you to believe. However, it is a nice piece of silver."
5,pretty holiday dvd,"I agree with the other person who said this needs to be viewed from a child's point of view. This is a pretty film. The princesses are on there enough to satisfy a little child, and Once Upon A Wintertime is one of the most beautiful pieces Disney has ever created. Yes it is old, but timeless.As for the Disney company wanting to make money, of course they do! Doesn't everyone? It doesn't mean you can't enjoy a film once you realize that someone is making money off of it."
1,What is on this dvd?,"Could someone please enlighten me about this DVD title? Is this a montage of the princess stories already on DVD? Is there any new footage? I know that the other Princess Stories (Friendship Stories...) titles are just clips from the studio releases(Sleeping Beauty, Beauty & the Beast...). Is this the same?"
2,Disappointing,"my daughters begged for this and then were seriously disappointed. Nothing at all new or fresh: just a tired reworking of the same material. One new Belle song, but if you have Belle's Enchanted Christmas, you have it."
5,Disney Princes,Granddaughter really enjoying all the stories along with the music. She has watched it over and over. Great stories for all ages to watch.
1,Daughter very disappointed!,"My 8 year old daughter waited for weeks for this movie to come out. They took parts from other movies instead of writing a new story line. Also, she thought it was going to be about something completely different based on the commercials. It was very disappointing seeing her so sad after watching this movie. Disney can do better than this!"
1,Very Disappointed!!!!,"I have to agree with most of the reviews that were written.I thought it was going to be Christmas stories with the princesses in the stories.My 3 year old daughter was very disappointed too.If I had known it was recycled material in the video, I would have never bought it.I personally beleive it is a waste of money to buy!!!!Very Disappointed!!!!!!"
2,Review of Product,"This was a cute movie, not as good as I expected. It came in a plain envelope, not the cover as I expected and was pictured. Not worth the time!Nor the money!"
1,NO STARS,"This movie is SCARY for little children. at the beginning of the movie there are monsters and dark scary wolves. Wellm first you hear the princesses sincging and you thik oh this is nice and all of a sudden there is scary music and wolves with red eyes. MY daughter immediately got scared (she is 2 1/2 and VERY advanced) I would never have imagined this. She just loves all of the princesses. I had the DVD version. I returned it. My cousin has two girls and one is FOUR the other is two, and she and her husband were watching with them and shut off the dvd because it is so dark and scary at the very beginning!!!"
1,my child in tears with disappointment!!,"What a disappointment! The format for this DVD is bogus. My 4-yr.old came to me in tears at the end. From the description, you'd expect new material. We, the viewers, sit in the theatre with the princesses while they watch re-run footage? They got my money but I'll endeavor not to spend any more Christmas money on Disney products. Oh, how the mighty have fallen! I really wish you could leave 0 or negative stars."
1,Very Disappointing,"My wife and I thought this DVD would be all Christmas songs along with Princesses either singing them or dancing, but boy, were we wrong. It has bunch of real boring cartoons that they hardly give you any warm feeling about Christmas."
2,Ehh...,"My 3 yr old daughter seemed to like it...so I guess that is the highlight, other than that, don't waste your money. This is not a new movie, it replays scenes from the princesses' original movies."
2,disney princess,"While the video is good and my daughter loved it, the sender sent us a dvd that was scratched all through parts two and three so we have to skip over them. I was very disappointed that a lightly used good as new product would be sold to someone when clearly it was damaged."
1,not a great value,"A few comments about why I didn't like the video for my daughter- The DVD is cheaply done. The animation is almost all old and there are frequent times when the princess look like an animated statue with only their mouths moving, while their prince next to them really does look like a statue since he doesn't move at all.- The Christmas themes are simply not well done with the video containing things that were more suited for Halloween than Christmas. The part where Belle almost drowns (and would have certainly died of hypothermia) is a good example of this, though not the only example.Overall the video is not at all suited for young children."
4,VERY CLEVER,Disney took alot of old clips from many Princess Classics and mixed it in with some new songs and new clips about Christmas. My three year old watched it 3 times today and loves it. I think its a little boring but what does that matter? She finds it very entertaining. Its worth the $13. Buy it for your princess.
2,Where are the princesses?,"While there is a lot of princess stuff, such as the storybook and the summary of the Belle christmas movie, it is interspersed with old cartoons which are poor quality and not appropriate for very small children. The very first cartoon sequence terrified my 3 yr old and I had to skip past it. She enjoyed the princess clips, but putting in those old cartoons was an obvious filler to make the DVD last longer and therefore appear a better value than it is.Save your money!"
5,Important Theological History for Disciples of Christ,"Steve Sprinkle, educated at Atlantic Christian, Yale, and Duke, on the faculty at Brite Divinity School at Texas Christian University, has authored a wonderful book about the theology of the Disciples of Christ. I read it for a doctoral level independent study on ""Disciples' Ethos"" at Lexington Theological Seminary and found it to be a great narration of Disciples' theology from a historical perspective. Don't be put off by the fact that I read it for school. It is well written and quite easy to read. I would recommend it for any Disciple or anyone who wants to travel through Disciples' history to gain a better understanding of this denomination and its way of thinking theologically"
3,T-shirts so-so,"While a Fruit of the Loom T-shirt is virtually the same anywhere you go, the details of this T-shirt did not mention what the fabric was for this shirt. It would have made a difference to me to know that this was a blend and not 100% cotton."
1,don't bother,"10k White or Yellow Gold Journey Circle Pendant (1/4 cttw, H-I Color, I3 Clarity)Very poor workmanship, necklace is only 16 inches, shorter than the description, and it is a very small circle. I was disappointed and returned it to Amazon."
5,Great!,"Whether you're a die-hard baseball fan or not, everyone will find Rumbo a las Grandes Ligas fascinating and enduring."
3,for baseball fans and those interested in immigrant stories,"If you're a fan of the current indie hit Sugar, this look at the Dominican Republic's love affair with baseball is the perfect companion piece. It shows a group of kids who dream of making it all the way, just like David Ortiz and Vladimir Guerrero and a host of others. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
4,Helpful,"Helped me play the game. Some of the information I didnt really care, and was kind of pointless to have in there, but it was worth buying."
5,ANIMAL CROSSING STATEGY GUIDE,STRATEGY GUIDE WAS HELPFUL IN PLAYING GAME TO IT'S FULL POTENTIAL!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR ANY GAMER WHO WANTS/NEEDS A LITTLE HELP WITH GAME!!
5,The kids love it!,"My daughter had this guide and found it indespensible. Two of her friends were so excited about it when they saw it, that I bought two more copies to give to these freinds as birthday gifts. One gal read it cover to cover. The other two use it for reference. I was thanked over and over for getting it by one of the friends."
4,Not a 5 stars~~~,"Well, I can't find information of how to create your face, your hair styles, how to hybrid flowers...I found those info online. Of course, for free. http://www.animalxing.comIf this book includes info that I mentioned above. It's a 5 stars definitely."
5,Animal Crossing Free-For-All!,"A very close friend of mine and myself are absolutely addicted to Animal Crossing: Wild World DS. We call each other almost every day with updates on our towns, who gave us thier photo, etc. It's a great game, really. Yet, some things are tricky. When can I find a balloon in the sky with a present? Which K.K. Slider song do I get this Saturday night? Which day can I watch fireworks? What time? So many questions I myself had trouble with are now answered.The guide includes a pull-out poster, which has the calandar for every waking day in my town's life. Need help getting that friend code? Help on that.What's with Boondox? A small table of the feathers they send you with high cash amounts donated.Lists of clothes, fossils, dancing groyds, fish, furniture, and bugs. Plus paintings, K.K. songs, and HRA scores.A true keeper. For the small price, this book will surely help you out."
4,Mostly harmless,"You know, this guide is very helpful. It has almost everything you'll ever need: A guide to fish, music, insects, and items. Well, not all the items. The only disappointment is how they don't they don't mention the Nintendo-themed items at all (Metroid, Triforce, Master Sword, etc.). It covers each of the themes, and shows what a room would look like with each theme. It also has 8 do-it-yourself patterns, using color-coding with the palettes available. Just be prepared to invest some time into them, because they're quite complex. If you're new to the world of Animal Crossing, get this, but check some fan sites like GameFAQs for those missing Nintendo items."
2,not what expected,"Although the songs and the pictures are nice, the toy doesn't have on/off button. So if you press the happy frog in the middle of the night - there is no way to stop that cheerful song. Also the flaps are kind of hard to open even for adult. And it is still too bulky for my 5 months old. She would love to chew on it but gets frustrated because is the base is too big and it's difficult to get a good grip on the pages."
3,It came dirty and out of batteries,"I wiped it off and put new batteries...it is an alright toy...However, my son will put anything in his mouth..."
2,"Good on picture, not that good in real","There are good products designed in the US and made in China, like Freddy the Firefly and Fisher price toys. This one is not of good quality. The painting goes away after a few scratches, which I don't like as babies put everything in mouth. In addition I didn't see in product description that music is included in the toy, and these songs are horrible (bad sound quality). I don't trust Leapfrog products anymore, waste of money."
2,Cheap,"I mean that in a quality sense. I bought it to match my pink phone. It's cheap, hardly ever works, and the phone button broke when I use it rarely to begin wth. Piece of junk, but you pay for it!"
2,Bad Bluetooth,I received the blooth and charged it for over 3 hours and when I use it the bluetooth cuts off on my conversations after five minutes.
3,good,My only complaint is that it has the tendancy to echo when the volume is turned up all of the way.
2,Junk,The fit of the headset is fine. But everyone I talked to said it was buzzing on their end. The sound on my end was fine but I had to return it because no one could stand the buzzing. Looks more red than pink in person.
5,MoDiva,"Iam extremly happy with not just this product but iam so very happy with the services from Amazon. I had ordered the same items from another company on the 14 of August and was told i would have my items 1 to 2 days, so i ordered from amazon on the 18 of August and recieved my items on the 19th, the very next day. I did not receive my items from the other company (which im not going to name names) until Thursday the 20th. I will never order from them again, I will just stick with Amazon, they are the greatest."
3,Sound quality good,The sound quality is good for the Motorola H500 Bluetooth Wireless Headset. My one complaint is that the curved ear hook is not adjustable. If you tilt your head the earpiece hangs away from your ear with risk of falling off. It can be altered to accommodate either the right or left ear.
4,great,I like the motorola bluetooth headset. It matches perfectly with my phone. The clarity is good. I would recommend this product to others.
2,Doesn't feel right,"I am returning this item because it does not feel secure on my ear. The reception on it works pretty good, however I can not stand the constant feeling that it is going to fall off from my head."
3,Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset,I purchased the Motorola H599 Bluetooth Headset as a replacement This is my second Motorola H599 Bluetooth Headset. I lost the first Bluetooth. I was very happy with my H599 Bluetooth that I purchased from Cingular and lost. It matched my cell phone and the quality was good. The Bluetooth that I purchased from Amazon does not match my cell phone and is darker in color than the cell phone I own. The off color does not bother me. I am having a problem getting people to hear me when I talk. I ususlly end up shouting. I was considering to either exchanging the Bluetooth or returning it and going to Cingular. At this point I don't mind paying a little more from Cingular.
2,Adorable but cuts in and out...,"Disconnects often. I have a brand new Audiovox 6700, so the issue could easily be with it, but I am unable to pair them for longer than an hour w/o the bluetooth connection dropping.I can't tell you how many times I've thought it was connected, answered the phone, only to find the headset/phone connection had broken and the person on my phone couldn't hear me and I couldn't hear them.Frustrating. I'm taking it back to see if it's the phone or the headset."
3,You can't go far with this one...,"I really like the color. However, it becomes not clear when you leave your cell phone -- you can't go far (only a few feet)... I have to hold the phone while wearing this earset in order to receive clear voice from the other party."
4,Perfect for the Price,"Works just fine for me. I hate driving & trying to hold a tiny cell, so this solves my problem. The battery stays charged forever. No static. The description stated magenta, but it isn't; it's light red. No big deal, but I wanted magenta."
2,"Bad, bad!","The two pluses to this product are its cuteness (including the nice vivid color) and its price.However, even at max volume I couldn't hear what people were saying. And also, it feels like it is going to fall off my ear. I did some tests, flopping my head around fairly vigorously, and it did not fall off, but it constantly felt like it was going to.I'm exchanging it for the Plantronics 510 which looks a bit dorkier, but has 4.5 stars after 1100+ reviews."
3,Mediocre product,"Everything about this product is just mediocre. The color does not match the magenta phone as it should. It doesn't sit well on your ear and if you bend over, it falls off. The loudest volume setting is so quiet that you have to press the headset tightly to your ear to be able to hear if you're in the car (although if you are anywhere but the car, it seems to be loud enough). Additionally, the battery really doesn't last very long; it has to be charged every night. I wanted a headset that would match my phone, but if I had it to do over, I would have purchased a better product and not been so vain about the color."
3,Good battery life...weak sound volume,"This is second unit i've owned (lost first). Impressed by battery life, but sound volume is inadequate unless surroundings are quiet. Will replace if I can learn about a unit with more volume. Sync with BlackBerry is simple but can sometimes take multiple tries. Syncs reliably once you wait 20 or so seconds, and found sync usually fails if attempted too quickly. Frustrating. Find another product. Update II: Now replaced withAliph Jawbone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset, and see my other review"
1,This headset does NOT work well at all,"I purchased this headset for two reasons: it was a good brand (Motorola) and it matched the color I want. I bought it for Christmas and was very excited. However, after charging it up and started using it I noticed a number of problems. Fist and most important - every single call of mine sounded so fuzzy that no one could be understood on either side. This is kind of an issue when you are trying to have a phone call!!!! I t also takes a good 5-10 seconds to answer the phone with the headset after you hit the button. By then the person has been saying ""hello? hello?"" the whole time.Anyway - I would ditch the Motorola brand because I have tried others (jabra and more) and they work AWESOME."
1,I received a defective piece of junk,I got this bluetooth earpiece for my wife to replace her old one that broke. I received the package pretty quickly but as soon as I plugged it in to charge it nothing. Dead on arrival. DOA!!! I would be wary to buy from this seller ever again.
2,Motorola Bluetooth,"I received this item in a timely manner. It is as described as far as looks go. I've used the Motorola H500 for years. I've worn out three or four of them. I find them the most comfortable of bluetooths. But this one must be a dud. It is so hard to hear on it, even turned up to the max. It doesn't always connect as it should. I'm really disappointed in it, and will have to look for a new brand that I like."
2,Bad earpiece,I purchased this bluetooth along with another style for my husband. His unit came with 4 different ear attachments so that he could customize the fit of his bluetooth. This unit only has the one built in ear clip. When you try to make it fit more snug all it does is push farther away from your mouth. I have long hair and this makes using the unit difficult as well as the hair interferes since the unit is angled away from my face.
5,A great Jack,"This is a great jack, and I have no complaints. As long as you have common sense and a basic understanding of physics, I don't see how you can go wrong with this one. I put it to the test the minute I got it and it has not failed to live up to what it claims it can do. I used it to jack up a grain truck and a hay baler...both of which will make a 2 ton spew it's internal seals all over the place, and with this jack, I didn't even break a sweat. The only thing I could say that you might call negative (and only if you didn't read the product details) is that the jack IS A FLOOR JACK...meant for a shop or garage. It's heavy, and you aren't going to carry it very far. The product is all that it claims to be, what else can I say."
2,Mediocre jack,"It is definitely a heavy jack meant to stay on the floor. I have an occasional problem with getting the jack to lift, it seems like a seal issue. When it does lift, though, it lifts perfectly fine. The foot pedal usually doesn't work correctly (another seal issue it seems). The manual was lackluster, too. A great price for how high it lifts, especially with free Prime shipping.When I opened the box there was a random long s-hook that I couldn't figure out where it belonged. One of the larger wheels was also missing an e-clip and can easily fall off now. I doubt I'll return it (too much of a hassle) but for the cost of the jack, I expected better.I would honestly stay away from this brand if you can, it's just made too cheaply for the price. But if you are looking for a medium priced/range jack, this one's not bad."
2,Big red jack,"Jack is very heavy and bulky, extremely slow to jack up and the foot is not hardly worth having, it's in the way more than anything. Needs a longer handle too"
4,An excelant book,"This is an excelant book about the relantion between the man and the carnivores. I think it is specially interesting for the people tahat want to know about the carnivores in a more general way. My only critical is that the focus of the author is on the carnivores of Africa and Europe, generally forgeting the species of America."
1,Put it on Kindle,Loved the kendall O'Dell books....fortunately I got them on kindle before the author got her feathers ruffled. I don't think that there is a need to kill trees for books....put it on kindle and I'll read it.
3,"Raises some good points but rambles, not enough information","Originally written by the author in 1992, She spent a year following the Poppers and their efforts to get people to see how the Great Plains states are dying. They are actually running out of water and losing population.There are a lot of pages about their travels, speaking engagements with often hostile crowds,hostile press (not all western) and some sections dealing with the science of what is happening to the land out there. You also get a fair amount of history, some people always saw the Plains as land that shouldn't be developed as eastern land had been (it wasn't suitable for such useage).I'd have liked more science and more detail on the Buffalo commons concept, it's an interesting idea but I don't see it becoming a national policy. The new forward and afterword deal with changes in the situation since the original publication but don't convince me that it has much chance of really happening."
5,A must re-read,A concise and well written book with solid doctrine. Expands your awareness of Satan's methods. - You can't go wrong here.
4,Great book,I think this is a good book and it makes you aware of the strategies of Satan. I think that it could be a little more interesting as far as the different ideas that he presents but it really does make you aware that it is a spiritual battle out here for your soul.
5,Reliable Information,Warren Wiersbe is one of the most reliable teachers on Bible subjects of our day. This book is filled with insights presented in a readable style. MUST READ.
1,more of the same,"This book was exactly what I expected a christian propaganda book to be, a bunch of scripture passages and then the author's thoughts on what those passages meant. I picked up a copy for a laugh due to the anarchist symbol on the front and I wasn't disappointed as it took a whole 9 pages (they are very short pages due to it mostly being bible verses) into the book before he goes and says ""It was this attitude that led him to rebel against God and seek to establish his own kingdom."" A kingdom implies a ruler which is the complete opposite of anarchy. This comes right after a very serious section about a woman being tricked by a talking snake to eat from a magic tree.Overall not anything we haven't all heard before and if you have to pick up a copy get one of the cheap ones from the used section."
3,"Baptised in Blood 2, better than 1st","The second XPW King of the death match tourny was a lot better than the first. The beauty of this tape is that fact that you get to see Homeless Jimmy. Jimmy takes hideous bumps and sells moves incredibly. Jimmy is by far the most talented wrestler to come out of XPW (besides Messiah of course). The first round matches are a little weak (besides Jimmy's) but the second round and finals are incredilbe. Also having Messiah fight that Tool reject was a waste of Messiah's stellar talent, although messiah does pull an ok match out of the big moron Tool. Seeing New Jack wrestle a ""scientific"" match with that guy that steals old school gimmicks is boring but funny. The tourney does have its drawbacks but it is better than the first and the semis and finals are pretty brutal so its worth your money if you buy it on VHS. Also check out the ECW dvds, because regardless of what XPW claims, ECW is lightyears ahead of where XPW will ever be."
5,The classic!,"If one is in this situation (terminal and worried), then this classic video complements the Final Exit book very nicely. If you sometimes worry about someday being in that situation, this is a good watch. If you know someone who's there...well, if you are a very good friend...and if you're friends enough to broach this, then I'd say it's a very good way to cover the information. ""Be Prepared"" is still a good idea."
2,Doesn't live up to title,"The title leads one to believe that this book would contain a wealth of information about George Riley and his involvement in automobile racing.Actually, it consists primarily of copies of some of his patents, copies of letters written to customers.While these are of interest, there is much duplication (most of the letters appear to be a form letter).The descriptions and photos of Riley equipment are good, but could have been more detailed. For example the drawings and pictures of the Riley racing carburetor are not complete.It appears that little or no proof reading of the narrative portions was done.George Riley was a gifted machinist and inventor who deserves a more detailed summary of his life and accomplishments.What photos of Riley racing equipment and early race cars that are included are good, but leave interested readers wishing there were more of them.Book is not worth the price."
3,"the most awesome, yet graphic game ever",My opinion on this game is that it is GREAT!!! this is simply because it combines a good story line with heart pounding action and well lots of blood and gore. which video games are all about
4,"an addicitve fun, smart blood bath","i got in the habbit of staying up all night playing this. The gore is excellent, the violence is off the hook, the multiplayer looks like alot of fun even though i haven`t tried it yet. dont realy have any complaints about this one except the graphics."
3,not so super,I am not feeling any better with this purchase.....I am going to rely on one multi vitamin in the future....
3,"Excellent Price, but don't notice much going on","I take these for my tendency towards intestinal inflammation. They work OK, but I've had the most success with enteric coated fish oil pills for my particular condition.These pills were just OK for me. Price is great, good value, and if your problem isn't gut related, I highly suggest these pills. I'm sure they would be just fine in cases of arthritis, heart health, cholesterol, etc."
4,So far so good,"So far this have been a good product. I have only been using it for 1 month. The only problem I have is I end up with burps that taste a little fishy, but that is only for about 1 hour after I take them."
1,Terrible CD,"I liked one song that had a great beat and vocals, then I realized that the dude is rapping about nothing? You have some talent there, very little, but you rap about nothing. Need more substance."
5,Makes a Wonderful Christmas Gift!,"I gave this to my husband for Christmas.It's entertaining to read and very informative.Love the section that explains ""wine speak."""
2,Better than nothing,"I wanted a new saddle cover for the bike I use in spin class and this looked as though it would be perfect. It seems to be made well and slips on and off the saddle easily, but the cushioning is just not there. After using it for a short time, I'm going to buy a better cushioned saddle cover to replace this one. I'm very disappointed and expected more."
2,Comfortable but not a good buy,"It falls off the seat too easily, had to super glue it to the seat to get it to stay. Wouldn't recommend if you want to use this for more than one bike."
1,Doesn't Fit Wider Saddles; Uncomfortable,"I have an 11"" saddle on my huffy and this doesn't even come close to fitting on it. The side covers have absolutely no stretchablity or give whatsoever. It is solely designed for the extremely narrow seats on high performance bikes. It would've been nice if it said that ANYWHERE in it's description (""fit's saddles ranging in inches - at it's widest part - from ________"" to ________"". The manufacturer just presumes all bicycles have the same narrow seat.I did gerry-rig it on and took it out for a few test runs. I agree with theother reviewers that said it made the comfort worse not better. The ""gel"" had very little give and kept digging into my backside. After the third ride I threw it away. It's junk."
2,Seat is too small,They need a way to advise as to how this thing is sized. It's too small for my seat and is useless unless I can find a grand child that needs one.
2,Effective padding but not that comfortable in actual use,"I bought this for my roadie. When I got the package, it felt like it would work out well, but the seat cover does not stay on very securely. It's constantly moving around.I think it would be more effective on a beach cruiser or something with a wide seat and where you won't be pedaling very hard. Then again for that kind of bike, you can just get a big fat seat, can't you?"
1,not pleased,"Although I measured the seat and it fits, it does not stay well on the seat, slides to the side when I get on and off. Tried tightening, really not that comfortable, would not recommend."
5,as advertised,seat cover has worked fine for about 4 mos now. withstood the entire hot summer sun as i locked it in parking lot at work. use it almost daily to commute. didn't burst or go flat within days as reported in other comments. very ergonomic and well worth the price.**update 7/2011almost a year and still going strong. outer fabric has faded a bit from having bike parked in direct sunlight for 8+ hrs almost daily. gel is still in place with no tearing or wearing as of yet.
4,Definitely worth the money!,"I bought two of these, one for my boyfriend and one for myself. We both agree they make a great difference when riding for sure. MUCH less painful than taking long bike rides without the seat cover! My only issue with this cover is that it doesn't stay in place (especially on my bike - a Schwinn mountain bike) while riding. Mine keeps coming off the seat on the sides. Mainly this happens when I am getting on and off the bike and I have to keep fixing it and tightening it on the seat. My boyfriends doesn't come off the seat like mine, his only shifts slightly (he has a Schwinn mountain bike as well).It is definitely a pain to keep having to fix but being that it is much more comfortable than a normal seat, I think it is a good buy. I just wish the seat stayed on as tight as when you first put it on."
4,Much needed,I use my seat cushion for my Sunny spin bike. It gets the job done. Spin bikes are uncomfortable so anything is a help.
5,"works well, hard to over feed","I grow hungry plants,and sensitive plants in soil and I really like this product.I cannot burn the plants at all, and the PH is good. I leave the gallon of water out to release chorine, not really a problem here. I end up using one tablespoon per gallon. Top feed every other watering. The output is the best, the plants go beserk with happiness.the key is big happy roots and strong stems.I started using floralious also, and was amazed at the smell and weight .I switched to using the cleaner also. floranova rocks.I tried f farm, found it very expensive and confusing to use, except. I have fiqured out out to use their grow food,one capful per quart or gallon."
5,I want to give Frances a BIG HUG!,"This book demonstrates how a true artist takes their work. It shows how her father couldn't really love her in the way she needs but her mother tries to make up for it and tries to clear away all the bad stuff from Frances's life. I related to this book in a way that made me feel that the book was written just for me, but backwards. Foos has a great perspective on an artists way of life. It's almost as if she is one herself. Although I am praising this book, it can be hard to follow at times. I found myself having to read some of the lines over again so I could understand. Other than that, I love this book."
4,Solid Contribution by Crais,"This is at least the second time that Crais has left his main subject (Elvis Cole) to take a side trip. The first was Demolition Angel, which I highly recommend. The title of The Two Minute Rule comes from the idea that a bank robber has to get in and out of the bank in two minutes or less, since two minutes is the minimum amount of time the police need to arrive at the bank once the alarm has been sent. This book features Max Holman, a bank robber who, on the day of his release from prison, finds out that his estranged son, a policeman, has been murdered.As with Demolition Angel, Crais demonstrates a deft touch with damaged people, making them sympathetic in spite of their flaws. I noticed a couple of the reviewers thought the book started slowly, but that was not the case for me. The opening pages were busy, since Crais had to lay a lot of groundwork for what followed.All in all an excellent read."
3,Unresolved,"Although well written, the author should have generated greataer interest in his story if he had more extensively developed the personal relationship of his principal characters."
3,The Fifty Page Rule,"I give every book at least fifty pages. The two minute rule did not pass. I need sympathetic main characters to identify with, root for, or otherwise care about. That was missing here, as the book spotlights an ex-con who makes no effort at rehabilitation, but instead pursues vengeance for a son he never knew (but obsessively cares about nonetheless). In addition, I didn't like the late introduction of a major supporting character, an ex-FBI agent who had no apparent motivation to help the main character on his ill-conceived mission. The novel has the requisite slam bang opening, but it takes a long time to connect it to the story line. Stir in an overabundance of profanity, bring it all to boil, and you too may decide to move on to something else."
3,Good but nothing memorable,"Maybe for a new writer I would give this 4 stars but I expect more from Robert Crais. I applaud his desire to bring a new character to life, but I just could not get very excited about this character or the story line. If he is starting a new series, he needs to make it a lot more interesting and intense before I will get interested. But if he is just filling his time between other projects, I can't complain too much cause he is always entertaining."
4,Pageturner,"I liked this book because the characters seemed more realistic than a good many other mysteries portray. The characters have flaws, some of them serious, and they don't perform miraculous physical feats. They are intelligent and human, and when they break the law, they are doing it for a good reason. The pacing of the story is good and the ending was not a letdown, as so many others are. I found it refreshing that the two protagonists did not jump into bed the first time or second or third time they met. There is an attraction here, but it is left unresolved, and that is as it should be. The whole thing made sense and I am ready for another by the same author."
4,Thoughts on Thrillers,This is the first Robert Crais novel I have read. I will now read more after enjoying this so much and reading the reviews on Amazon. I was especially taken by one individuals review which discussed what makes an unusual thriller or mystery--select your word. Many writers can drive a story. It is the unusual one that drives a story and creates characters who you care about. Max HOlman is one of those characters. We understand that he has a special quality that fits with the story. He is believable. I have given the book only 4 stars because I had a harder time believing Katherine Pollard.In summary this is a great read. It is in the class of Micheal Connelly who is the gold standard in my view
5,Redemption is uplifting.,"Maybe you need to be a parent who has made mistakes or known young men who really messed up their lives early to appreciate Max Holman, the author's ""hero,"" who regretted missing out on his son's life and tried to atone for past neglect. I understood where he was coming from and admired his tenacity -- and the author's ability to give me a memorable character that I will long remember. The critic who said the characters were not fleshed out echoed my sentiments during the first 50 pages. After that, I was right there at Max's side and I ""saw"" him clearly, right inside. Loved the book!"
5,outstanding,"I have not liked all of Robert Crais' books, but this one is a real winner. When I first heard the premise I thought it sounded silly -- a criminal and the FBI agent who arrested him teaming up? Unlikely. But Crais pulls it off wonderfully. The criminal character is one we are rooting for from the start and the FBI agent is plausible enough that the relationship works smoothly. The story in complicated in that there are lots of characters to keep track of, but the quick pace and surprises of the story kept me turning the pages regardless. All the loose ends tie up nicely in the conclusion. Highly recommended."
5,Crais does it again,"As Two-Minute Rule demonstrates, Robert Crais is, quite simply, among the best American novelists writing today. We have many terrific mystery writers--Connolly, Parker, Deaver, Sanford to name just a few--writers who mix action, great characters, pacing, atmosphere, and intelligence into great books. But I submit another novelistic test of greatest: Does the writing transcend the genre? Put another way, are you reading a great mystery (or action thriller) or a great novel with elements of action, mystery and suspense?For me, Crais, with his last few novels, passes the test and thus joins a short list of simply great novelists...familiar names like Hammett or Chandler or, more currently, Ian Rankin or Charles McCarry.I can only agree with the critics who say: Please Mr. Crais, right a little faster...the wait between books seems too long."
2,Perfect Summertime Read,"Robert Crais has a knack for writing some terrific page turners. This is no exception - the only problem is that it's totally unrealistic. As stated in previous reviews, the notion of an ex-con turning to his arresting officer (a female F.B.I. agent, no less), AND getting help from her...well, it kind of strains the boundaries of reality. That being said, the novel is full of exciting plot twists, the reader is not sure who the bad guys really are, and best of all: it's fun. Take this one on your next vacation - but make sure you bring some other books because you'll finish this in record time."
3,Ho-Hum: Another Mediocre Mystery,"Robert Crais is one my favorite authors, however, this is another of his latest mediocre books. It is not an Elvis Cole story, but instead uses an ex-con (Max Holman) and ex-FBI (Katharine Pollard) agent to team up to find out the details of Max's son's murder.Although the story is somewhat interesting, and the characters are somewhat dimensional, there isn't enough emotional attachment to either to carry this ordinary murder story. There isn't anything new to the story line, it is quite plain and easy to figure out. The atmosphere of the story is all blah. I'm giving it 3 stars because as a Crais novel, there are times of interest, but if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have read it. Since it is a stand-alone novel with no interest in the character continuation of Elvis or Pike, it is very meaningless.While I can't recommend it, it would still make for a quick read on the beach on the plane."
4,"Kinder, Gentler Crais","We all love to hear Elvis Cole's wisecracks and watch Joe Pike take down bad guys. At the same time, it's nice to see Robert Crais do a love story, in this case a story about a man's love for his son and his possible love for a woman.The story is tight, the characters engaging, the ending satisfying, and even though the ending is telegraphed to an extent it still brings with it an element of surprise.The subtext: honor among thieves. Of the purest variety."
2,Terrrrrrrribly disappointing ploddddddder; sad,"The opening scenes of this stand-alone are as exciting and engaging as any you'll read. Then as the main story begins, Crais inexplicably shifts into reverse. That's the only way to describe the plot that is so slow-moving as to be dead in its tracks. Not much else to say here.The Elvis Cole/Pike series books are excellent; he has another character who shows GREAT promise (Carol Starkey from ""Demolition Angel"") waiting in the wings.This one is just WAAAAAAY POOR in comparison to every one of Crais' other efforts."
2,The 2 Minute Rule,This is not an Elvis Cole Mystery. It was very slow moving and I regret that I purchased it.
1,The Two Minute Rule,".The Two Minute Rule: This was very boring to me. I really enjoy mystery/thrillers, but this one just did not have enough drama to it. Slow go all the way, did not even finish. I think it would have been more intriguing if the son and Dad had stayed in touch with each other"
3,Bit of a Letdown,"I feel I should begin by saying Robert Crais is one of my favorite authors. I think his Elvis Cole mysteries are fantastic, and not to be missed. Maybe part of me was just wishing I was reading a new chapter in that series, but for the first time I was a bit disappointed in one of his books. Max Holman is an ex-con who upon release from prison learns his son who is a cop, has been murdered. When the police shut the door in their investigation of his death., Max takes it into his own hands enlisting the aid of an unlikely ally: the FBI agent who sent him to prison. The book moves along and is an enjoyable read, yet to me feels like an adaption of a movie I've seen before. A romantic subplot seemed forced and almost uncharacteristic,and for me the ending became predictable. Fans of his work will certainly want to check it out, I just personally felt it wasn't his best."
4,Dependable,Crais can be counted on for a twist on the ordinary. Always entertaining. After many books that is a high compliment. He is a name to look for. New work to be anticipated. Thank you.
3,Loved It! ..... But,"First, I am always entertained by Crais' books so was delighted to pick up this one. I won't go into the plot since others before me have done that. It started out well and did drag a bit after Holman got out of prison. I agree with other reviewers who wonder how a convicted criminal could turn into such an overall nice guy when released; however, his being captured in the first place explains he did have caring instincts.I frankly loved the plot and when I read often skip over logic as there is enough of that in real life. So Holman hooking up with Pollard seemed acceptable and even reasonable, since he was at wits end to solve the murder of his son.The digging for information I found exhausting yet credible and I never picked out the guilty party until just towards the end.So, definitely I'd recommend to others."
4,a different style crais book,"Very readable, with good technical writing. However the characters are less developed than those in previous Crais works, especially the Elvis Cole series. I found it hard to like any of them, although maybe this was intended to give the story a grittier aspect. The setting for the ending is done well.If this was not ""a Robert Crais book"", it would be interesting to see if it got any serious notice. Again, very readable with good technical writing. Not his best."
2,"Not bad, but not his best","Having read several of Crais's books I was looking forward to this one. For the first time I found myself distracted while reading the ""Two Minute Rule"", and put it down seberal times over the course of 3 weeks. I finally finished it, and was a little disappointed. For the first time I couldn't get excited about the players in the story. This is probably a personal quirk of mine, most of the reviews loved the book. I'd reccommend Watchman, Demolition Angel, or any of the Elvis Cole book if you are reading Robert Crais for the first time."
4,Most enjoyable. Crais tells a grand story.,"I have liked every single book, series or non-series, which I've read so far. He's very readable, well articulated and quite comfortable to read."
4,Good fast read. interesting all the way with a number of twists. great ending.,The Two Minute Rule was a fast and interesting story with a terrific ending. characters well developed and their roles were appropriate
4,Great read,Crais is one of the best and am working my way through all of his titles good stuff hope these characters appear again
4,"Fan, not objective","I had a lot a fun reading it, like I usually have while reading this autor. I do not plead to be neutral, I am a fan. It is not is best but it is good and you have what you paid for"
3,Crais is highly reviewed and popular,He writes with skill and is fun to read. His hollywood endings are jarring and the depth of the experience is like a good TV show. Worth having but not compelling.
3,Two Minute Rule,It was Ok. Without Elvis and Joe it just did not flow. I just did not like the two leads very much.
2,Not Great,"Robert Crais is one of about a half a dozen authors whose new work I always buy in Hardcover. I read several books a week and Crais' books are among the few that I don't buy used or get from the library.I am dishearteded to say The Two Minute Rule was tolerable at best. The characters were not well developed. The story started out great, but fell to a plod after the first few chapters. The plot was predictable. The love interest seemed like it was forced and just didn't play with the rest of the story.Crais previous work has never failed to ""take me there."" If you love reading you know what I mean. My advice is, if you have not read any of Crais other books, pass on this one. Instead go pick up any of his other books. If you are Crais fan, you might find this an enjoyable read. I have a hard time believing anyone would think this is his best book.The good news is that Crais is too talented not to bounce back with a winner and I'll be first in line to buy it!"
4,Crais Keeps Getting Better,"This is one of Crais' best books. My main complaint about Crais has been that his plots too often rely on convenient coincidences and other devices -- devices which usually mark the novelist as lazy or unimaginative. But in this thriller, Crais not only minimizes those tricks but he also lays out a poignant story with a real, three-D characater (Max Holman). Like most cop and spy thrillers, things get a little crazy at the end, but again, Crais seems to keep this relatively under control. All in all, it was a very good read, held my interest and left me eagerly awaiting his next book. I think Crais is improving with age and although I don't yet think he's in the same league with Connelly or Lescroart, he's almost there."
4,"Good, Just Not His Best","Robert Crais is a name you can count on for dependable suspense.With 'The Two Minute Rule' he has delivered another suspenseful story. I can't say that this is his best work, because I've read better novels by this author, but it's not a disappointment either. With a suspenseful conclusion and an overall good storyline, Robert Crais fans should not be disappointed."
4,needs longer cord,"The unit itself works fine, but it could usea longer cord. The cord only reaches fromthe back seat window to front console.If you have a large SUV, forget about runningit up from the back, it won't reach.Otherwise, the unit is great!"
2,Not a performance enhancer,The remote antenna for my Garmin grabs more satellites and increases performance. This antenna did not increase signal but allowed me to move the Magellan down on the console where I prefer it. So it depends on why you are buying it.
1,The case is nice.,"Other than a very nice case, these bits are worse than useless. They are poorly made, not straight, and will rip gaping ill-shaped holes in your work."
5,Great Jacket,Love this jacket-- got one for me and my son-- the sweatshirt material that is in the inside is very cozy and warm-- the shell keeps the rain and wind out.
4,Good Buy,"I mostly like this set. Great price to be sure. Did not know much about Robert Johnson, but I can say this: strangely, I find the artist I like least on these CDs to be Robert Johnson. Lot of good tracks. Particularly the first CD, which is the highlight for me. Though Elmore James is always good. Quality is excellent and a very solid collectible. If you just want to hear Robert Johnson to know what the fuss is, I'd check the library first."
3,GREAT FOR SMALL TRUCKS,THIS RADIO IS GREAT FOR SMALL TRUCKS I FOUND IT EASY TO INSTALL GREAT AM RECEPTION FOR TALK SHOW LISTENERS PLAYS CD AND CDRS WELL
3,ok...,"I bought it, found that harness cable was necesary for easy installation. but did not play the cd-RW. radio reception is good, and also plays original cd-r's well."
3,"Good Guitar Work - too ""studio""","Avid Bugs Henderson fans will be disappointed in this ""studio"" release. Bugs always has and will do his best work before a live audience. The choice of tunes is interesting, perhaps the best cut being the Ventures ""medley""."
5,Swarovski Crystal Pineapple,Very pretty! A lot of sparkle. It was a smooth transaction and arrived quickly.
4,Great insight into New York of old,"Living in NYC and close to Hells Kitchen I've heard of the Westies, reading this book takes you back in time to NYC when it was tougher and crazier back in the day. If your a fan of organized crime stories, or history of NYC I recommend this book. I will say some of things written about may be hard for some people to read, but the history itself is worth it."
4,Exciting read but some facts are not straight,"This book is a very exciting story to read. Really enjoyable story and well written.However, some of the info on the Gambino family is wrong. Nino Gaggi's age is off by about 15 years. Roy Demeo was a Soldier and not a Capo. Danny Grillo was not a made guy, only an associate. Paul Castellano was not Carlo Gambino's nephew, he was his brother-in-law and cousin.These are easily verifiable, known to everyone tidbits that were wrong. Why do all the research for a non-fiction book and then get sloppy with the little stuff? It calls into question the accuracy of the entire book."
3,It was ok,"Historical read about Irish hooligan gangsters in hells kitchen through the ages. It was alright, I ultimately stopped reading about halfway through because I had a more interesting book to read. It's not so much written as first person fiction as almost like a third person historical text. I'm actually not sure what the breakdown of history/fiction is in this book."
4,thrilling New York history,I found this an enlightening and exciting story of crime in New York City. It certainly gives the reader insight into the Irish and Italian communities dealing with crime.
4,Gansters crimes while I was in junior high school and high school.,This book shows that their is a light awareness of gangsters and their horrible desire to get money even if they have to kill someone.
5,A jaw-dropping tale of violence and betrayal,"Thanks to Hollywood, organized crime groups are seen as independent and generally antagonistic toward one another. As author T.J. English shows, that's hardly the case. Crime groups often form loose alliances when there's money to be made, and in the 1970s and '80s the Mafia found it beneficial to outsource murders to Manhattan's Irish-American gang, known in the press as the Westies. While the Gambino family had their own in-house butchers (Brooklyn's DeMeo crew), there was plenty of work to go around, and the Westies relished their calling, often dismembering their victims to make them ""disappear."" The Westies had the guts but they didn't have the brains, and ultimately they were undone by their lack of discipline. When their chief assassin turned state's witness, the gang was decimated. English does a stellar job with this jaw-dropping tale of violence, brotherhood and betrayal."
2,Conservative,"I was intrigued since a good part of my childhood was spent in the NewYork area along with ""Irish roots"". I haven't finished this particular book, unusual for me; howeverI was not enjoying the violence and so found myself feeling more upset than intrigued, perhaps someday I'll give it another try!"
4,wacking 'em,"on the back it say something like ""we'll shoke the most harden true crime reader"" or some crap. it did, right up near the end when it told of these 2 young up coming gangsters who gave another drug dealer a warning to stay off their turf by wacking off all over the guys face. i had to read the paragraph three time before beliveing what my eyes just read.those filthy irish."
3,More hype than substance...,"Before I read this book, I had heard about the almost legendary brutality of the Westies from more than one source. It turns out that even though these guys were a bunch of ruthless killers, in my opinion (based on the book) they were not that much worse than many Cosa Nostra crews I have read about. Their structure was also very loosely defined, and for that reason they were not much different from a bunch of screwed-up kids from a bad neighborhood. Having said all that, I would rate it as an average book on organized (or disorganized in this case) crime."
2,The Best Of A Bias,Mr English only interviewed Mickey and sat in on some of the West Side Manhattan peoples' RICO trial for his information. The story that English and Featherstone tell is wrong. They attribute incidences to the wrong persons in several cases. I am very close to atleast one of the men that Mickey put away and am convinced that Mickey greatly stretched and distorted the truth. He made himself out to be a Special Forces Hero when he was actually only a clerk and his purple heart was for an accident that he had when he was drunk and wrecked a vehicle from the Motor Pool.
2,Westies,Didn't like the book. Too much violence. Not something I would recommend unless you like this type of reading material.
4,Good Real Life Mob Book,"Those who get a little too wrapped up in ""The Sopranos"" should read books like ""The Westies"" every now and then just to remind them of what havoc real life organized crime can inflict. The book chronicles the rise and fall of the Irish gang of the same name that was every bit as bloodthirsty as John Gotti's more famous crew. The gang occupied New York City's since regentrified Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. Mystery author Lawrence Block effectively used the Westies lore in creating the character Mickey Ballou in the Matthew Scudder private detective series. The fictional Ballou could be Jimmy Coonan or Mickey Featherstone, the real life chieftans of the gang, who were known for dismembering victims and dumping their bodies in the East River.""The Westies"" is a brutally violent story and one that makes good reading for anyone who likes real life organized crime stories. The prose and the reporting are a cut above average for this type of book."
5,Involved,I think the book is really interesting reading. It keeps you really involved in the Irish Mob (Westies) One of the reasons I think that it kept me really involved is because I can relate to the book since I am from Hell's Kitchen as a little boy and my family is mentioned in the book on how they killed my dad. It is very sad but true. These guys who were doing the killings all deserve the death penaltly.
2,Are You Kidding!,"I am reading this book now. I am so disturbed with it that I had to write my review now. For everyone who said that they gave this book to their husbands, sons, and uncles, you have just basically gave them a book that teaches them how to cheat on their wives and girlfriends. If you are thinking about buying this book for a male DON'T. This book doesn't have one positive image of a female in this book. It is either the nagging housewife, the jealous girlfriend, or gold digging females. Which means that it makes seem like it's o.k to cheat on females. Also it gives examples and stories of their cheating, but get this if the get caught it shows them how to cover it up or do better the next time by using pagers, call fowarding, or switching it around on the female. If you are in a relationship don't read this book, because it will make you believe that he is cheating when he is probably not. So for all of you that liked it, what were you reading."
3,This book was okay but nothing new.,"Unless you are under age 21, this book really provides nothing new on male infidelity. I've seen far better written on the subject. How men cheat? With lies, sex, porno, etc. Why men cheat? Due to emotional deficiencies in childhood, with parents, due to the media depicting women as sex objects, etc.Grown men do things because they CHOOSE to. Boys blame others for their choices. Most women, married or not, know if or when they have a promiscuous male on their hands whether he's a father, brother, husband, boyfriend, etc.My only downer on the novel is that Baisden tries to glamorize infidelity with ghetto terminology such as ""playa"" and ""playa-hating."" Substituting such terms for clear ones such as promiscuous, male-nyphomania, etc keeps the subject serious and gives the other more credibility. Also, Baisden should have delved into factors such as homosexuality, bisexuality and asexuality in Black males. Otherwise, a well-written book!"
1,Boring,I thought his book was really boring. All it was was a small collaboration of real-life stories. I would not recommend it.
3,wasnt satisfied,i didnt really care for this book. reason being it didnt help me all that much. i mean for the most part men are predictable and if you know pretty much some of their tricks then you know them all. women are different. we're more sneaky and clever with what we do. and we dont get caught as much. and im not talking from experience. just one of them things that i just know. i do recommend ppl to read it. it might teach you something. but i dont think it did much for me
3,"Hmmmmm, aight","The book was aight, I am so glad that I read Michael Baisden's second book first.. This book was not so appealing, I can't see how most people rated this a 10!!!!! Not to be playa hatin Mr. Basiden, but this one was not so hot!"
5,"breathtaking,honest,an in-dept view from the maleperspective","When I heard about this book, I just had to read it. I wanted to know the answer to that question that I asked myself on a number of occasions. When I finished the book in two days I realized that what he had sad was true and I knew it all along, but did not want to hear it or believe it. It was nice to finally hear the truth from a male and not have to guest the obvious. Many people think Michael is arrogant, and self centered and many more thing, I think that those people are still blind and choose not to see and the men are mad cause he told all the dirty secrets. I have been single (happily) for four years cause I choose not to settle. I live by this book and I thank Michael for being man enough to publish it. Michael if you ever read this, ""keep them comeing"" Hey, maybe your next book should be ""happily single"". you sure can interview me, I have many stories to tell."
4,Definitely a book worth reading. Enlightening and truthful.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was amazed to find such truth coming from a man as to how and why they cheat. It was a good read, but it was also thought-provoking in the sense that hopefully women will see themselves in the scenarios presented and will begin working on building their self-esteem and love for themselves and put an end to the game playing that goes on constantly in the name of a relationship. We, as women, must expect only the best for ourselves and we must start demanding that from the men in our lives."
1,"Oh, Please!","This book was BORING! First off, this man has no degree specializing in relationships. So these are from his ""findings."" I could not keep focused nor could I stay awake. I thought I would read this book since I read his other and two, and from all 3 experiences with Michael- I will not read a fourth book from him."
3,Sinners Not Cheaters!!!,"It is amazing to me how anyone can label a man or a woman a cheat when the fundamental issue in these sad scenarios is that these people are SINNERS. Yes, I said SINNERS, not cheaters!! Profoundly good sex was designed for marriage (a serious committment) and that can be scientifically proven. Any other ""relationship"" involving sexuality is either fornication or adultery where one leads to the other and one is automatically a ""cheater"" in both cases. This book does illustrate our socially catastrophic mating practices in an entertaining and titillating manner but offers no solutions to the quest for MEN AND WOMEN having SATISFYING & INTIMATE UNIONS both men and women deserve. If you're interested in touring a scenic route of our moral and spiritual free-fall, which hasn't hit (in this book) bottom yet!!; go ahead boys and girls read this book with discernment and repent!!!"
3,I Give Up,"As if women didn't have a tough enough time, this book illustrates the suffering exponentially. The book itself was pretty much common sense stuff, but quite entertaining. The anecdotes seemed a bit over the top and at times strained. Some parts even made me think I'd seen or heard about it from a movie somewhere so take it all with a grain of salt. It's good to take along on a road trip or for a simple diversion. The only thing the book did for me was decrease my interest and faith in monogamous relationships and confirmed my worst fears while bringing all my imagined worst case scenarios to the forefront of my mind. As a woman, it leads me to ask the question, ""Why should I even bother?"""
4,I like your non-fiction better than your fiction!,"I was one of those very negative reviewers on Baisden's Men Cry in the Dark. I still consider that novel a waste of trees but at least Mike made some financial profit from it.Yet, I really did enjoy this non-fiction work! What was done was great! But it was incomplete and not enough, which is why I did not give it 5-stars.The author should have went more into the Playas family histories, possible psychological problems, homosexuality, bisexuality, asexuality of promiscuous Black males. The book fell short just a bit, because he seemed to blame female more than the man. But the book is still good!I still say, Mike should avoid fiction writing like the plague, dude!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Stopped reading after first few chapters. This book is an insult for any intelligent woman. Very outdated, goes into detail how to use your ""pager"" for cheating purposes?"
3,Great Book!,"I love the book, its Michael Baisden's original book - which the second edition is now out of - Do men know what they want Never Satisfied. I just wished I had realized this was the first edition so that I didn't buy both books but they are both wonderful!!"
5,EYE-OPENING & REALISTIC,"I REALLY THINK THAT THIS BOOK, KINDA GIVES WOMEN A HEADS UP ON THE NO GOOD DIRTY THINGS THAT MEN DO. IF YOU ASK ME, MEN HAVE NO REGARD FOR THE FEMALE GENDERS FEELINGS AT ALL. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO RISK YOUR LIFE, RELATIONSHIP, AND YOUR PARTNERS LIFE JUST FOR A ""QUICKIE"". I WILL FOREVER SAY THAT MEN ARE NO GOOD AND A SERIOUS WASTE OF TIME. BECAUSE THEY ALL ARE THE SAME. AND THIS BOOK PROVES WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG. IT'S ABOUT TIME A MAN STOOD AND CONFESSED. WHAT WOMEN HAVE KNOWN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME!!!!!!!! THANKS"
4,"A humorous, but not fully believable insight...","I've read a variety of Baisden's works and, easily, this is the best of them so far. The behaviors, explanations, and testimonials appear most believable when placed in a southern or middle American setting. From my experience, I'd find it hard to imagine in the Big Apple. As a result, it serves more as an entertainment device than an informative device for me. Some of the passages made me burst out laughing in full hysterics. I've often recommended it to others from that alone.I couldn't advise a woman to read this to truly learn about a cheating personality, but it could certainly illuminate one to possible traits with the use of intelligent reasoning. More often than not, the answer is obvious. Besides, that's what private investigators are for. Kidding!"
4,Understandable,"When I got this book maybe I was expecting a little more insight on what the brother is thinking. But, overall this was a pretty good book. There was a lot of repeating scenarios but, to know what a man is thinking about us conservative women in clubs was excellent insight!For the women who do read this book you can learn something if you don't already know what the male species is thinking and doing I already knew a majority of the things written. A lot can be heard ladies if you just listen!"
2,Great read,"I am the Author of Pay Attention to the Red Flags by Charlene Davis, MSW. I have read this book Never Satisfied over and over. I have given it to women as a gift. Michael has done a fantastic job, and everyone should purchase this book. Never Satisfied will make you think hard while you are in a relationship. This is a terrific piece of work."
2,My Scene Jungle-Licious Madison Doll,Pretty much the same type of doll as a Brat Doll. Nothing wrong with the item but it wasn't what I expected. I didn't think that the Brat Dolls were very good for a small child to own so I purchased this type and was surprised to find almost the same idea of a doll who might actually in real life be a lady of the evening. It was nicely made and my Granddaughter liked it ok. Not bad for the price.
1,crime stopper,description was not adequateThere was no diagram for installationTech support number did not reply to my pnone call.
4,"""Action""","We love Jay Mohr and found this series to be funny and ""real"". e really enjoyed watching it all unfold."
3,The complete series?,"For those of you who are late to the party on this one, get it NOW!I did not give it the five stars it deserves because is this the entire season?I did not see the episode where Illeana Douglas' character sleeps with the send-up on Bob and Harvey Weinstein to get financing for the picture.It was one of my favorite episodes so I was disappointed not seeing it.Maybe they put it in a closet, so they can pull it out in a couple years for a 'lost classic' re-release."
4,Behind the scenes,"Outlandish and fun. The first episodes, which appeared on Fox, are wonderful.. so that's how TV production REALLY works?! It holds up after a decade, too! Reserve a table at The Ivy."
1,WARNING : DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE,"If Amazon.com had a 0-5 rating this movie would definitly be a 0. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. Nat Puvanai and the whole cast can't act and the director can't direct at all. The special effects SUCK, the acting SUCKS, the directing SUCKS. IT ALL SUCKS. I reccommend instead of this movie Alligator. Alligator is a terrific creature feature with grrrrrrreat special effects!"
2,Crocodile,"This movie offers nothing but a cheap killing crocodile. The effects are awful. When the plastic looking crocodile eats the deer it looks completely fake. The croc is always attacking villages and every scene has people [throwing up] up blood. The characters are awful and the writing is terrible. The plot is about a giant crocodile ( your told its big, even though you never see its whole body ) who starts killing people. Know a scientiste and some other guy must go on a boat and kill it. ...It is enjoyable at times though. If you like these kinds of movies than this is for you."
3,Why Only 12 Episodes and NO Theme Song???,"As many on Amazon, I've had this pre-ordered since I heard about it. And while it will be nice to have some Providence episodes on DVD, why only 12?! And the fact I've just read that ""In My Life"" WILL NOT be featured on the opening segment of any of the episodes credits is really ridiculous. I'm giving the set an advanced 3 stars for at least making some episodes available and for some interesting extras. Makes me wonder, though, if any other popular songs featured on the sountrack of the episodes may not be provided, as well...."
4,Where's the Theme Song?,"I too am VERY DISAPPOINTED that they didn't use the original theme song on this DVD set!!! What were they thinking??? Why wouldn't they have done that - it makes no sense at all!!!! I didn't even get to watch all of the set yet due to time constraints, but why in the world aren't they selling them by season like every other tv series?? I would like to have every single episode - this was my favorite show of all time!!! If they do decide to do every season on DVD, which I HOPE THEY DO, Please use the original theme song in the beginning!!!!! Other than that, you can't go wrong with any episode!!! It was something I looked forward to every Friday night!"
3,"Great Series, HORRIBLE ""Collection""...","Providence was a wonderful series; good stories, scripts, acting, etc. It's a real shame that the producers decided to release the series as a ""collection"" as opposed to releasing it as it should have been, by Season. (ex: season 1, discs 1 thru 4, Season 2, etc).Character development and the growing/changing relationships between the characters, over the life of the whole series, is an integral part of what made Providence special. Trying to watch 14 ""random"" episodes, in no particular order just DOES NOT WORK.It does not do the series any justice and is a real disappointment. Please release this series IN ORDER, please, please...."
3,Providence The Collection,"I loved the show, but these episodes didn't really do the series, as a collection any justice. I would have preferred ""Providence"" the entire series. Now that would have been worth the money. This, unfortunately was not."
4,Providence Rules!,"I just wanted to say that I love Providence. It was my favorite show. This DVD was great, but it was only a Best OF. I wish they release every season. This DVD was great, but it would be even better if they would release all of the seasons."
3,The Providence Collection,"First of all, I was happy there was a Providence DVD, but disappointed that there was only the one. I liked the shows on it, but it did jump around a little too much. Could be due to the fact not knowing which episodes to put in. Anyway, some of my favorites are missing. I should think with all the hype nowadays of making DVD's of TV shows, there should be more than one DVD of Providence. It was a great show, and we could fall in love with the characters, and definitely identify with them and it was missed when it went off the air by me and I'm sure lots of others. How about more DVD'S."
2,The Providence Collection DVD ( 4 disks/12 episodes),"The first disk of the four disk collection we received was suppose to have 4 episodes, but our first disk only had 2 episodes. What happened to episodes 3 & 4? We enjoyed the episodes that we did get, that's why we rate it 2 stars instead of 1 star. (Disappointed Providence fan)"
4,Bosch T5002 10-Piece Assorted T-Shank Jig Saw Blade Set,I really haven't tried these out yet but I am being pestered about doing a review on them. They appear to be fine and will do the job.
1,You can't count !,"Received product with only eight blades enclosed. Product says 10, Picture shows 10 yet I had only eight in my package. What 's up with that.Your regular customer, David"
4,"Good, solid, descent value","good blades. Seem like quality metal and good manufacturing. Its a basic set. 2 rough cut wood, 2 smooth cut wood. 2 soft metal(short blades), 2 medium metal (short blades). Nothing fancy, but its descent for 10 bucks"
5,Works Great,Just dont get confused- this is for straight lines only. Good blade and lasts well. I like DeWalt stuff and this balde will work with all DeWalt jigsaws.
5,Bosch Sabre Saw Blades,"Wide selection of Bosch jig saw blades at a reasonable price. These blades when available, are overpriced in most hardware stores. I am 100% satisfied."
5,Great car for a cheap price,"This car has ended my long disappointment streak with cheap RC cars, most cars at this price get shorted or stripped out within a weak but I've driven this car to it's full potential the whole time and it still works great. I think it would be a great gift for a young boy who usually tears up toys quickly, because this car has stood up to a lot of damage that would kill most RC cars."
2,The Vet doesn't know what he's talking about,"The author of this book was humorous and entertaining. However, he gives information that misleads many people. He firmly believes in de-clawing, which not only is mentaling disturbing for a cat, but can cause back pains and hurt paws. When claws are removed from a cat, the cat must shift his balance from his toes to the heel of his paw. Which in turn will hurt his balance and grace. The vet also lets cats have kittens, even though he knows that there are 45 cats for every human on the planet. In other words, he condems cats to go without homes."
1,Didn't work right out of the box,"I ordered this toy early for my 8 year old son for Christmas...early October. Christmas Day, my son opened the present, we put a new set of batteries in the truck and control and NOTHING. We tried the same batteries in another remote control car, and it worked. We tried another set of batteries...NOTHING. I cannot return this toy because it was purchased in October, even though it wasn't even opened until Christmas Day. My son is even more disappointed than I am. So much for shopping early for Chrismas...so much for expecting a toy to work right out of the box!"
2,"Nice try, but no...","It fit my camera perfectly, but, the photos are blurry.Even when looking through the lense with your eye, the center seems a little out of focus. (In comparison, when you look through a professional 35mm wide angle lense, there aren't any blurry parts.)"
3,Works well but the mag mount is a little problematic,"The lens works on my Aiptek pocket camera but the mag mount ring was too small for the camera. I snipped the ring into four pieces, stuck them on and the lens now attaches perfectly. A little bit of image degradation versus no lens but it does the job."
2,Quality not as expected,"Well, I am a bit unsatisfied with this product. The pictures have a noticeable distortion at the corners, and the borders of the lens frame appear at the corners. It seems the lens is just a bit too small...Also, the included magnetic ring, that should be attached to the camera, is just too small to fit on the camera frame. I had to adapt it by braking it in four pieces.It does provide a wider view, but the quality does not allow me to use it effectively.Not a good deal for me."
3,"Fine product, but poor description","I bought this for my daughter's Nikon L20, but the mounting ring was too large for the camera's lens. The description that, ""the magnet... holds the conversion lens in place when fixed to a 17 to 27mm point-and-shoot lens"" provides no guidance whatsoever. Is 17 to 27mm supposed to be the focal length or the lens diameter. If it's meant to be the diameter, then it's inaccurate because there is no way the mounting ring will accommodate lenses that vary by a whole centimeter. I returned the lens without trying the medium size.On the plus side, the build quality seemed good and the image quality was fine (from pictures taken just holding the converter up to the camera). For $25 this isn't going to be Nikon glass, but if it fits your camera, it can be used to create fun, Holga-like images. Also, Adorama accepted the return without hassle and didn't even require an RMA."
3,Dark spots with flash,It's good if you don't use the flash is my only complaint. It's a good tool however for me. If you use a flash it creates a shadow in lower left corner of the shot. I probably will get the zoom one also for an option for my pics. I was told to zoom out a bit to try and eliminate the spot I have not tried yet.
3,Health Enthusiastist,After researching traditional as well as nontraditional careers the author shares information from personal interviews of individuals presently practicing their choice occupations. This book expands the readers knowledge from a self committment of healthy living and eating to a job area in which you can share your enthusiasm and knowledge in meaningful life work.
4,Great tool!,"This is a great tool for kids and also might be useful for adults. Personally, though I like it, I think its a little bigger than I would like. However, it works flawless."
2,flimsy mechanism,"The metal levers are prone to pop out, making it fairly useless and somewhat unsafe. I would look for something higher quality if giving it to your child or planning to use it in your car."
4,Very Useful,"I know this is a toy to use to educate children on the use of coinage, but our children are parents now, and I bought this for personal use to keep in the car when I am buying food via a drive-through. It is extremely useful. A waitress at Sonic saw me using it, and called over another co-worker to see it. They thought it was great. I do too."
4,Change Please?,I bought this to make change and count change at Bible School. I was the banker. The children loved it. My son loved putting the coins in the right slots and spitting them out to make change or count the coins.
3,Takes a while to get going...,"This is a short portrait of bourgeois Russian society just before the Crimean war, mainly, and its loves and hates.The most memorable character is a young Bulgarian, who moved to Russia as a child, and decides to go back and drive out the Turks. The reader gets something of the feel of the pan-Slavic movement of the time, which drove Europe to one of its major continental wars (which led almost inevitably to WWI and II). The most memorable scenes are in Venice towards the end - I won't give too much of the plot away.This isn't Turgenev's best work, but is worth a look, if you have enjoyed his other books."
3,It is a helpful tool,"Our experience with this book was not as glowing as other review I have read, but it has been insturmental in helping my daughter have a ""safe"" place to practice bow tying."
4,Good beginning Book,"This is an ok beginning book. A little busy, and the directions are less than stellar. My daughter likes it as she REALLY wants to learn to tie her shoes, but has ALOT of trouble following the directions."
3,Weird way of learning,"I like the book idea, but the directions are weird. It's a good book to proactice after children are shown an easier way to tie their shoes."
3,nice hands on practice,"I'm sure that this book works well for some children, and it was cute to see two books in one, but neither of them interested my daughter. I found that when she did practice, there was enough difference in working on a book and a shoe that it really did not help her make much headway in learning to tie her shoes."
2,Dollar stores,"While there are some good ideas contained within this book, the main advice is clip coupons, shop around, negotiate, and go to dollar stores--often. If you were to count the number of times that the words ""dollar stores"" come up it must number in the hundreds."
3,50 healthy foods magnet,I gave this as a present. The recipient enjoyed it at first but found it to be troublesome after a while.
2,Disappointing,"I love this perfume, and was quite excited to get the powder. However, when I opened the package, both my husband and I were taken aback. The powder is a small amount ""inside"" the powder puff. The container you see is just the box it stays in. It smells great and does have that sparkle, but I like seeing the powder. The product is actually very good, but quite overpriced for what you are getting. I will search out other powders in the future."
3,I have had these shoes for 3 years.,"Now, the black polyurethane heel has scuff marks that I cannot change. The brown outer leather needs frequent polishing and loses color easily. The inner heel has lost its leather and foam and fiber/plastic shell are now exposed. The insole is still in great condition and very comfortable. The shoes are much looser than when originally purchased. Everything else has remained in acceptable condition."
2,"One side is great, the other side ain't.","It looks like a beautiful shoe from the one picture shown,but the other side of the shoe looks very ugly- like one ofthose cheap leather jackets sown together from tiny irregularpieces. It's also been exhausting trying to return them.The paperwork for returning was not sent with the shoe,I called Macys, they told me I could return it at a store.When at the store the manager told me they'd give me $20.00in return. So, I'm back to trying to return them by mail.Overall, Amazon.com is great, but this one experience wasdisappointing. I believe one photo is given for a reason."
1,pseudo watch review,"was looking forward to my new watch, but received a pair of loafers instead, and unable to get help to return-be careful eeveryone!"
3,Squeaky shoes,"Love the look but they squeak, so i will be returning them. I wish they didn't or else i would keep them."
5,Great Shoes!!!,I bought these shoes for my husband who is in sales and is standing and walking all day. He loves them. They are very lightweight and comfortable! He first bought a black pair and they were so great he wanted these brown ones also! I would highly recommend these if you are on your feet all day!
2,Very Disappointed. These Shoes LEAK!,I have loved & worn Clarks for years. However this particular shoe is a major disappointment. While it looks & feels good the logo on the sole pops out & allows water to seep into the shoe. Don't wear when it rains or you will have wet feet all day. Good for dry days though if that's what you want :-).
4,"Very comfortable, unique styling",I tracked these down in Black after buying a pair in brown a couple months previous. What attracted me to them was the unique stitch styling and the immediate comfort from the first day. They did not require any break in time. They can be a casual or dress shoe. The sole material is soft and is very easy on the feet. They run a little wide which is good for me. Highly recommended for anyone that has to wear a dressier shoe but wants the extra comfort of casual features and great fit.
4,stylish shoe,"The shoe looks great and I've gotten positive comments, which I never get, on shoes. I wish it was easier to slip on though, and that my socks wouldn't bunch up. Its hard to find socks that fit size 7 mens, so I'll either have the heel bunch up, which just looks bad, or the top of the foot will bunch up, which is not so bad. They are very comfortable and I'm getting used to the low backing on the shoe. I would highly recommend for business casual, even for a casual night on the town with a stylish pair of jean and such."
3,fitment,right shoe was not a fitleft foot was comfortablekeep shoe but had to perform a major stretch on right shoeI feel it was a manufacturing issue
2,"Ordered brown burnished, got dark brown","I bought the brown *burnished* shoes and got brown instead. The brown is a dark, almost reddish brown. I used to love my brown burnished escalades. I don't understand why they don't make them anymore. The new shoe feels different from the old one but I can't put my finger on what has changed. I am planning to ""burnish"" these shoes myself but am bit apprehensive. If you have suggestions, please leave them in a comment. Thanks."
3,Not Bad But,"Well those chose are fine but seams and joints are not the best, that's why a only gave 3 stars"
5,Very comfortable,"Little to no break in period and after 3 months of wearing, still look and feel new. Runs true to size."
3,Wrong color,"The Clarks Escalade is my favorite shoe. But the ""brown"" color shipped is far darker than the image shown and my current shoes. Happy with shoe, not color."
4,comfort and light,These shoes are comfort and light weight. I have arch pain. And these shoes reduce some of my arch pain.
3,"A bit Squeaky, tongue catches your trousers.","Generally a good shoe as noted by many reviews.Overall liked them but a couple of concerns:1: They are squeaky, I wear them to work and everyone knows I'm coming (tile floors). Not extremely bad, but noticeable.2: The tongue catches over my pants when walking and makes for an odd look and feel. I do not have a very tall mid-foot height which may be contributing to the problem.The positives:comfortable insolecomfortable widthnice styleI definitely like them better than my other similar shoes. Next time I'll try another Clarks shoe, probably not this model."
4,Great Study Guide,This book is powerful and uplifting. It speaks to the every generation and is part of my daily praise and worship.
4,Calling All Cheeeze Addicts!...,"Finally, after an interminably long wait, SLITHIS has hit DVD! This brutish slab of slimy mazzarella is a personal favorite. Watch agog, as the aquatic creature eats dogs, hippie chicks, and dirty old men like tasty treats! See the incredible turtle race scene! Marvel at the SLITHIS-CAM view! Cringe in abject horror at the 70s fashions and groovy dialogue! Witness a local high school journalism teacher track down the beast almost single-handed! This film is not for the cheeeze virgin! Only those w/ years of experience enduring such films should attempt viewing SLITHIS! Is it a fish? A man?? A manfish??? It is SLITHIS! Add this one to your cheeeze locker today..."
3,Seen better. Much better,Glad I didn't spend anymore on this one. Just really never got my interest up on this one. Guess I expected too much.
4,Philips Earbuds fit well!,"Small ears? These are the ones for you. All I really needed was something that fit and stayed in place on the stair climber and bike. They are comfortable and make listening a pleasure. The cord is very long, but is easily tucked away. Can't beat them for the price."
4,Reading with your ears,"I bought these earbuds specifically for audio books. They work very well, concentrating the sound into your ears and eliminating most of the ambient noise. I'm not sure what the noise cencelling switch does except amplify them further, but for my purpose they work fine."
4,"Noise cancelling is barely OK, but good for the price","Do not expect to hear nothing while using these earphones, especially if you have heard some ""tales from Bose"". The bottomline is that if you spend less than $25 you cannot ask for a $200 performance. It is very good though, the noise is reduced easily by 50% (the packing says 70%). The size for the device is manageable and the earbuds are comfortable. Use them to hear music, not just to cancel the noise and sleep on your flight."
2,Not a great item,"I read several reveiws praising these headphones and decided to order a pair. When I received them I was surprised at how bulky the ""noise cancelling"" box was. I don't think it does any noise cancelling whatsoever. It is very inconvinient for trvelling or running since the ""noise cancelling"" box would probably weigh more then your mp3 player and headphones put together. The headphone buds are also not comfortable, and constantly fall out, even when sitting down.I would like to return this item, but I don't think that I can."
3,Noise Cancelling?,"The circuitry does not work well enough to be called noise cancelling. I've used them in a huge variety of situations (talking, airplanes, sleeping, background music), and the noise cancelling introduces about as much volume in static as it eliminates in noise.Aside from the noise cancelling electronics, the earbud design is excellent. The sound is fantastic, and it seals well to the ear, muting outside sounds many times more effectively than its active noise cancelling.I've found a small amount of discomfort wearing them for extended periods, which can be solved by putting them in up-side-down and running the cord behind my ear.Don't obsess on the noise cancelling -- it doesn't work, although it might be *slightly* better to turn it on in a noisy environment, since the quiet hiss of static is often more pleasant than whatever noise you're trying to get away from. It's still well worth the purchase."
3,Ear buds,We wish there was a volume control for the fuzzy noise. It needs to be a tad bit louder!!!!
3,Adequate for back-up,"I haven't detected any ""noise cancelling"" with these. Sound is OK to these 60 year old ears, but the wires are not joined together as with most ear phones, which makes them tangle very easily. Also, there is a bulky battery case (supposedly to run the non-existent ""noise cancelling"") which makes the whole affair unwieldly for carrying around. I'll use it for a back up or to loan to someone. If I had it to do over, I would not buy this."
2,"Sound lost balance after a few months, on my second pair too.","This is my second pair of Philips SHN2500 noise cancelling hearbuds in 6 months. As happened on my first pair after only a few months of happy use, the sound is now no longer balanced left-right; coming strongly on the left and very faithly on the right.I take very good care of my equipment, always keep the volume low. No tear nor wear took place on either my players not the hearbuds. It has nothing to do either with my mp3 player: I tested the buds with other players and my player with other headphones. No idea what is happening and I am logically not happy at all.This is unfortunate for otherwise Philips's design, quality and price were good for my taste."
2,Bulky and awkward,These headphones work well but the noise canceling switch is bulky and pulls at the earphones. It is not far enough away from the earbuds to put in a pocket.
1,No noise cancellation,"These ear buds have no noise cancellation at all.I have some over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones,so I know what to expect from noise cancellation.I tried these ear buds both with the noise-cancellingswitched on and switched off. I made sure I had goodbatteries.With noise cancelling switched ON the sound is slightly louder,but there is NO noise cancellation. Non at all.I tried them on a airline trip, and they have no effect at all on the engine noise.I didn't expect the ear buds to be as effective as my over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones, but the ear buds aren't effective at all. Zero effect.The quality of sound isn't much different than the cheapest drug-store ear buds."
1,"OK earbuds, but FAILS at noise cancellation","I bought these to replace an older pair of noise cancellation headphones, thinking it'd be nice to have something a bit more compact, but it fails at the one feature I wanted - noise cancellation. As far as I can tell, all it does is generate white noise, in a (bad) attempt to mask ambient sounds (e.g. fans running nearby, engine noise aboard an airplane).Save your money and buy something else if noise cancellation is one of the features you're looking for.Pros:- uses just 1 AAA battery- comes with a 3.5mm to airplane seat plug adapterCons:- The earbuds each have their own separate cable, making for a tangly mess - I resorted to using short pieces of twist tie to join them together for most of their length, like nearly all other earbuds are designed.- The noise cancellation doesn't work. Unlike other noise cancelling headsets I've owned, all this pair seems to do is generate white noise in an attempt to mask any ambient background noise. FAIL"
2,I am not impressed....,"I have a couple other noise cancelling headphones to compare with. The JVC over the ear works very good in the flights, not as good as Bose but for the price I paid I am satisfied. The Sony noice cancelling headphones are specific to my little MP3 player and work like a charm, absolutely great but I can not use them in another player that is why I bought this one. I am disappointed that it merely increases the volume and cuts out some noise by sealing your ears with the plugs but electronic circuitry does not do anything. What yo get is a regular in the ear headphone with a bulky battery compartment hanging, very inconvenient."
1,Pretty much worthless,"I have a couple of over-the-ear noise cancelling phones, however the in-ear (earbuds) concept made a lot of sense to me. The design should have had the advantage of a partial earplug along with a very close location for noise sampling which could be applied to the noise cancelling technology.Philips managed to miss on all cylinders. The internal circuitry is noisy, adding a noticable hiss to the material, while the noise cancelling circuitry is ineffective. The end product is a pair of mediocre earbuds that add white noise to your listening material. Pointless and overpriced."
2,"Sounds is good, noise canceling is just ok","I like the sound on these, especially for their price, but the ""noise canceling"" comes more from the seal the buds create with your ear than the noise canceling switch. When it's on, it just creates faint static that you can hear behind your music--not great. I am also not thrilled with the bulky battery box on the cord, but this doesn't seem to bother others. Ok for their price, but I would much prefer the sony ones I used to have without a switch--just plain earbuds."
1,waste of money,"I thought for sure these would have some capability. They don't.Apparently their idea of 'active' noise canceling means to add static and boost the volume on your music. The only thing that I noticed getting canceled was already blocked out through their inner ear design, and at the price of adding static noise to all your music. One may think these work after extended use but only because they are now passively blocking out other noises because of the static that these produce. 'Active' noise canceling in this situation apparently means noise cover-up technology.At least the ear buds feel comfortable and you get an airplane adapter... but then I fly cheaply on airlines that don't have entertainment or meals.I'm glad I only paid $10 but they are really only worth $5 and even that's being generous."
3,"Good Audio Quality, But...","These earbuds deliver good audio quality, but the noise canceling feature is probably not as effective as some buyers might expect. The specifications bear this out (external noise is cut by about 50%), so buyer beware. If you need more noise cancellation or want to listen in very noisy environments, consider a different style of headphones. I find the ear canal placement to be more comfortable than the larger earbuds that fit in the outer ear."
1,Just expensive ear plugs,Not worth it at all. Nice packaging! Mine didn't work at all by eliminating any noise. They just produce the humming without any noise cancellation. I tried them in the same environment side by side with another pair of mine.Don't waste your money.They do make good ear plugs and eliminate noise just as ear plugs.This isn't the first crappy Philips product I try.
2,Poor quality,"If you are looking for some earbuds to listen to music with, these would not be in your best interest. I found the sound quality to be quite poor. They would probably be all right if you interests are more towards audiobooks and podcasts."
2,Noise cancelling? More like noise adding,"PRO: It's a decent set of headphones, IF you leave the ""noise canceling"" off. Sound quality is better than some other cheap headphones I have used. The in-ear design does a reasonable job at blocking outside noise.CON: The ""noise cancellation"" feature is a total joke. For all I can tell, it doesn't eliminate any noise. It actually ADDS noise. A LOT of it. As other reviewers have pointed out, the moment you turn on noise cancellation, you hear a very noticeable, annoying hiss. At the same time, the volume of the music goes up. Also, just as someone else has already pointed out, the battery compartment, which also contains the noise on/off switch, is really bulky."
4,Item performs as advertised,"So I was looking for earbuds with noise cancelling for all the plane trips for work AND for mowing the lawn, jogging, etc. Always want to be able to hear what going on around me. Fully enclosed headphones make sense for the plane but not much else so these seemed to be the perfect match and all purpose.I read user reviews and decided to go with these. Yes, they block out background noise, and the 70% figure advertised is just about right. The highs are crisp, the lows are nice, could be a little better but at this price point, fantastic. The medium sized rubber plugs fit me fine and stay in quite well, but when very active, occassionally need adjustment (rare).So, if you want full noise cancelling earbuds, these are not for you. IF you want very good noise cancelling and very good dynamic range with out paying as much or more than the device you plug them into, then these are for you."
5,Good Earbuds,"These earbuds are great. The only knock is the kind of large noise cancellation box that you have to carry with you. Otherwise, these are the perfect earbuds"
1,Noise cancelling was negligible if any,"This is the second noise cancelling headphone/earbud I've purchased. The design is nice and compact, however, I took this on to a plane and it didn't cancel ANY of the ambient noise (the earbuds did block out some noise but any set of earbuds would do that). I thought it was the battery but once I took it out to replace it, all sound stopped, so you can't even use them as a standard earbud set, if the battery dies they are completely useless. I own a pair of Kensington noise canceling headphones and they did a fantastic job for $30, albeit not as good as the Bose noise cancelling headphones but for the money they did a pretty good job. I would recommend you skip this product."
1,wasting money with this product,"I brought this product to see if the noise cancelng feature would help reduce the everyday noise surraound us. It does not at all. In addition, it injects a high pitch tone to the background. Not worth the money at all."
2,Not good and not awful. Just blah...,"I bought these a few years ago before a trip to India and the days of plane rides before me. I had my Bose triport headphones, but I had learned from previous experience about the engine rumble. These headphones did take care of outside noise, but not much else.The sound quality is very bland without much of any bass or treble. I guess I would call it almost muffled. Also, the battery container and switch for the noise cancellation hangs heavy. These definately aren't super portable or anything. Even so, they do work at a minimal level. Perhaps they're worth 20 bucks to someone. I think 5 is more fair...."
2,"They're so cheap, I had to give them SOME stars","I bought these mostly because of the relatively low price compared to other active noise canceling earphones. They do a somewhat reasonable job of reducing airplane/train noise, but the audio quality is pretty bad (unless you listen to everything at low volume and your musical selection has a low dynamic range.) With the volume set loud enough to hear the soft passages, the loud passages are totally distorted. And the double wires coming from the control box to the earpieces just adds to what is already a tangled mess with almost all earphones. Save your money and get some decent earphones; you really do get what you pay for."
2,Noise cancelling doesn't work,I realize you get what you paid for but I don't detect any noise cancelling in these. Perhaps I got a lemon. I give it 2 stars just because they work with regards to music but I bought them for the noise cancelling.
2,Unreliable earbuds,I purchased these ear buds as a christmas present and for myself. One of the earbuds fell of within a week. The person that I brought it for said that the same happened within a month. The sound quality was great while it held together.
1,Junk!,"These are by far the worst headphones I have ever owned. I got them because they are from a good brand and look nice. After a week of using them the sound in the right ear bud started to lower and sometimes would just go out. I changed the battery for the headphones many times and the sound was still no good. Another annoying thing about these headphones is that in the middle of the cord the plastic box for the battery hangs down, it weighs too much on your ears and is a hassle to carry around or find a place for."
4,Good Value!,"Bought these to use on airplane and they work pretty good with good sound quality while blocking out 50-70% of background noise. Keep in mind these are not comparable to BOSE NC headphones with a $300 price tag, then again they only cost $28 at Walmart...big difference! The cord and NC control could have and should have been designed better (longer cord and a clip on the NC control) but they work fine while sitting on an airplane or at a desk. These are not for use while working out or riding a bike (shouldn't use NC headphones while riding a bike anyway!) they're too cumbersome. Overall good product for the price and much better than what comes with the Ipod, and you won't care if you lose them because it won't break the bank."
1,the worst earphones ever,"I found this eraphones' quality of sounds to be very poor, for regular use and especially in noise cancellation mode. If you expect to get active noise cancellation mechanism you will be disappointed. The only thing it does it boosts the mid range volume so you will not hear the background noise. you can do it yourself with any other earphones through the equalizer function of the iPOD.Inverst your money in regular good quality earphone than spend your money on this piece."
3,Pretty Good - Could be better,I used these on an airplane and did get the benefit of a relatively inexpensive in ear type noise cancelling headphone that worked well. Two issues with the design:1. With no volume control you have to rely on the power of the device and in my case I needed to crank up the portable DVD player to the max to get the sound I wanted. This would be alot better with a volume booster especially considering the fact that there is a on/off switch on the cable for the noise cancelling with a battery. Why not add the volume boost?2. There is no clip for the noise cancelling block making the headphone drag on the cable. I had to use the seat tray to hold the block to avoid the unnecessary weight drag.
1,Bad is an understatement! Don't even think about buying these,Phillips must have made a mistake and wired these backwards beacuse when you flip the power switch on they actually create more noise then they cancel. The sound quality goes from bad to worse. These headphones are beyond awful. I can't believe I actually paid money for this garbage. I rated them one star only because they don't have a negative star option. Buy something that works and don't be sucked in by the lower price. In this case you will get much less than you pay for if you don't heed this warning.
2,Just OK,"I've bought this headphones. I would say they are just ok... In my eyes this noise canceling unit is way too heavy and the sound isn't sastifying at all. I was sceptical at first, because of the other reviews and unfortunately they were right.So if you are thinking about about to buy new headphones, this wouldn't be my first choice."
2,No In-Line Volume Control!,"I bought these looking for a pair of earbuds that would hopefully fit my ears, because none of the others in the past have. If you have small ear canals, and have never been able to wear earbuds comfortably, then you will probably not be able to wear these either. I wanted a pair that had in-line volume control, so I could turn on my player, stick it in a bag, and be able to adjust the volume from the in-line volume control...except there isn't one! Sure, the box is there to turn on the ""noise cancellation"", which to me sounds like it just doubles the volume, but there is no volume control as advertised. I'm sending them back to look for one that does have it. Sounds not great, but not the worst I've heard."
1,"Bought twice, returned twice.","The specs seem good, they're a good fit, and the sound's quite decent, though a bit bassy for my taste. However, both times the left earbud has stopped working after about 3 weeks of use.Could just be very bad luck, but this time I'm asking for the refund and trying another brand."
3,"Not bad with the sound quality, but not very functional.","Just a quick summary of my experience with the head phones. The sound quality was pretty good. I isolated and cancelled out outside noise very well. The ear buds fit relatively well and comfortably. The problem I had was the pod which held the battery and power. It was very cumbersome and awkward to hold, store, and use. In addition, the the rubber part on the ear buds kept popping off. Using the earphones during workouts were frustrating as the battery pod kept flopping everywhere. Not a big fan of the noise-cancelling function due to the fact that it creates a hissing noise that is very noticeable when listening to certain types of music. They do work well if you're just using the noise-cancelling function, but if you are wanting to listen to music at the same time then I would definitely look somewhere else."
4,Great budget noise canceling,"Great headphones for the price. Sure, the noise canceling is not perfect, but then you're not paying the price of Bose headset. Besides, there's naturally some limit to how effective in ear headphones can be at canceling all noise.It is true to say that sitting at home on the couch and turning on the headset, some background hiss can be heard. However, get them on an airplane and you really notice the benefit as a fair chunk of the background noise is taken away. Or put another way, it's the first time I've not had the volume set to max so I can hear my music properly. the buds themselves are comfortable, and there's a choice of 3 different sizes to fit your ears. The canceling unit is a little heavy, but is designed to be hung around the neck by looping the headset wires behind the neck, so it's never a big deal.In short, these headphones aren't perfect, but offer a good degree of noise cancellation in a comfortable package and are excellent value."
4,Noise Canceling Headphones work fairly well.,"I have used these phones while mowing the lawn and I can hear the music better than with just plain earbuds. Whether the effect is due to an increase in volume or from some ""filtering effect"" is unknown to me. Maybe it is both. The buds fit comfortably in the ear and produce decent fidelity. I wish there was some sort of volume control on these phones since you have to carry around the hefty battery pack and control module which is distorted (smaller) in size comparative to the earbud size in the promotional photos."
4,what do you expect?,These work just fine for being outside or walking in the city and cutting down some noise. I really wonder about some of these reviewers...what exactly do you expect to get for $15? Give me a break.
1,"Poor quality, so-so performance","I purchased these headphones with high hopes as I've had pretty good Philips headphones in the past. What a mistake!! The in-ear seal is terrible (keeps losing seal which renders the bass and noise-cancelling useless), the noise reduction itself seems to be dependent on just raising the volume and the unit is awkward to carry around. To add, the sound in one of the earbuds started to dim after a few weeks of (modest!) use before the unit stopped working altogether.A waste of $30. Move along, nothing of worth to see here..."
1,very disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this product. When I first got the package, the left earbud was very low volume compared to the right. In mere hours, both stopped working (I did not put them through extraordinary strain). Even if it had continued to work the battery pack in the middle of the cord is very awkward. I strongly recommend against purchasing this product."
1,Pass on it,"Perhaps I got a bad unit, but after two months of light use one of the channels faded almost to nothing permanently (tested with new batteries, different unit, etc.). While it was working it seemed to be okay- not as good as my Kensington noise canceling headphones, but not bad. Most of the noise-canceling occurs because it acts as an earplug. The active noise-canceling effectiveness is marginal. I was also a bit annoyed that the wires were always getting tangled and the cord to the n.c. unit is just a couple inches too short to fit in my jacket pocket without pulling on the earbuds. I would have given it 3 stars had it kept working properly."
1,piece of crap like all other phillips headphones,"Phillips just needs to give up on headphones while the sound quality is ok the comfort is not, it feels like walking around with your fingers in your ears."
5,Love Them!,"Oh how I love these headphones!! I share a computer with the living room TV and am constantly having to turn my music up with other sets of headphones. I hate the clunky around-ear headphones so when I looked into earbuds, these were the best deal and they really are worth the price! I dont even need to have the active noise canceling ON to get peace and quiet! The minus on these is that there is a big black box 3/4 of the way down on the cord that controls the active noise canceling. It constantly gets in the way, but if the headphones are worn in the way that is instructed on the box, it doesnt pose too much of a problem.overall, great headphones!! cant wait to use them in the up-coming school year!"
3,philips sh2500/37 noise cancelling,"They work pretty well. The sound is not great, but they are not designed to give fantastic sound. They are intended to cut down on background noise (like on a plane) and they do a pretty good job of doing that. I have used other products of this type and have better results and worse results, but by that same token, they are pretty inexpensive and lighter than some of the alternatives. I have used them for about 10 hours on the same battery, and have been pleased by the performance. I will keep them in my gear bag for use on trips."
5,INCREDIBLE!!!,"These headphones are ablsolutly awsome! The sound quality is mind blowing, I actuly thought someone was spaeking right next to me once or twice. The sound cancelling works but it could be better, it seems less like noise cancelling and more like an amp. The 3 different ear bud size ensures a great fit. If you have 23 dollars i really suggest you buy these."
1,Terrible Sound Quality,"I was hopeful after all the positive reviews I read, but these headphones are awful! The sound quality is poor; it sounds like I'm listening to my iPod through a tin can. And when I turn off the ""noise cancelling"" feature, I can't hear anything at all. I'm in the process of returning these and just getting another set of regular iPod headphones as a replacement. Avoid!"
1,No active noise reduction AT ALL!,"I just brought these home from Staples. I cannot see how these can be claimed to have ACTIVE noise reduction. The only thing they do is slightly amplify the source sound. The classic test, to turn them on with some background noise but no signal, reveals ZERO noise reduction. There does not even appear to be a microphone anywhere in the system that could detect and correct for noise. Nothing you do with the battery unit (moving closer or further from noise sources, for example, indicates that ANYTHING is happening at all. The product is apparently falsely presented. The flexible plastic earbuds are reasonably good, and block sound almost as well as my KOSS Sparkplug earbuds, but there is NO evidence of any active noise cancelling at all. I plan to return them."
1,Ear bud dud,Ear buds were a total disappointment. No bass impetus. Poor treble quality.Battery power is a joke. I purchased a less expensive pair at Walmart. No comparison in the quality of the audio output. If it weren't such an inconvenience I would send this product back. I should have known better.
1,bad,the ear buds really didnt block the outside noise cause you could still hear things because the noise cancelling really didnt work bud the best ear buds are the jl audio ear buds those are the best
1,Almost useless,I purchased these to use on a 9 hour flight to Amsterdam. There was almost no discernible difference between these and a regular pair of in-ear earphones. They don't seem to work well in airplane environments.
1,do not recommend,I bought a pair for my son as a stocking stuffer. They lasted about 6 weeks and then the left channel stopped. The seller would not replace. My advice is to buy a higher quality unit from a seller who backs the product better.
1,Find another pair of headphones.,"These headphones are horrible. You can turn the noise canceling on and off. When the cancellation is ""on"" you hear a constant ""hiss"" and what music you can hear sounds extremely tinny and somewhat distorted."
2,Not All That,"I purchased these headphones based on the reviews, but after receving them, am very disappointed. The ""noise cancelling"" feature is a joke and the sound quality is just not there. I took them on a plane last week and found they didn't block any of the noise. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Phiilips Earbuds - Sound Quality Terrible,"I returned these the day after I received them from Amazon. They fit OK, they were comfortable but the sound quality was absolutely awful."
1,"Does not work, poorly designed ear piece(s)","I bought a pair of Phillips Active Noise Canceling Ear budsbut am returning them immediately.The problem is that, due to poor design, the ear buds do notgo into your ear canal and make a complete seal, letting in outside noise, rendering them useless.I live within ten miles of a busy airport, have some Rat Shack N/C headphones, ( which work quite well) and thought these Phillips Active Noise Canceling ear buds might do the same thing in a smaller package.- Phillips Active Noise Canceling Ear buds do not work at all.Yes the packaging is to die for, and the color scheme of same isexquisite..- But, due to some petty cheapness within Phillips, or lack of consumer testing,the product ear buds do not seal out sound, letting in the jet roar, and rendearing all the fancy electronics, packaging, marketing, etcutterly useless.** Avoid **"
2,Bad Hissing,"I bought these earbuds about a month ago and when they came I tested them out on my laptop. When I plugged them in there was a weird hissing sound in the background. Once I turned on the noise canceling, the hissing became even louder! I thought that this must be a defect in the item so I returned them and exchanged them for a new one. The new one also has a hissing on normal use.It is strange that no one else has mentioned this though..."
1,Noise Cancelation Did Not Work,"I have a pair of Sony noise cancelling headphones that I use at work. They are great and help mask the sound of the multiple computers and equipment nearby. I was looking for a pair of bud headphones that would be easier to travel with. Due to the small size, I did not expect buds to work as well as standard headphones. But, when I switched these on, there was no affect on the noise at all. When I turn on my Sony headphones there is a really noticable difference. With these, only an electronic click and all of the same noise. They just do not work! I returned them and am upset that I will lose the cost of shipping. Don't make the same mistake that I did. Buy something else!"
1,Very Poor PerformancE,"These noise cancelling earbuds are terrible. I am amazed that Phillips puts their name on these. They reduce the output of your audio device to the point that you need an inline amplifier like a boosteroo. They fall out of you ears leaving the earbuds behind stuck in your ears, remarkable, considering Phillips also makes medical devices....like defibulators. The controls are awkward and turning the device on or off is a two handed task....save your money."
1,Third set have failed.,"These headphones work fine initially, but fail far too easily.I first a set 3 years ago, and liked the way they fit in my ears.Soon though, one side of the stereo started to fail. I jiggled them for months to get them to work until they stopped functioning altogether.I bought another pair and they failed after a some months of light use.Dumb me, I bought this last pair and THEY have now failed.I know, I know, fool me once... Except I didn't learn and went to thrice.The noise reduction works but produces a hiss that you really only notice between songs.My advice: There are so many better options. These seem designed to fail."
2,Too annoying to use,The battery container does not clip on and the cable is too short to put the container in your pocket. This causes a weight on the ear buds which is really annoying. These are much betterhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TL08YC/ref=wms_ohs_product
1,Reminds my of Wizzard of Oz,"Didn't like at all. But I was expecting Bible times and close to scripture based. Modern day setting, well I didn't even finish it."
1,Mediocre,"Don't buy this movie, it is a really weird and quirky movie. It's like they're trying to make fun of this beautiful biblical story."
3,Fun video,I would recommend this for a child getting to know about God and the Bible..not really something for an adult to sit through.
5,Your Soul's Gentle Shepherd,It's a lovely book and helps you feel closer to Jesus who is with us all the time showing us the way!
1,Invincible until your dog gets them,My lab retriever destroyed these rings in a matter of minutes. The name is completely misleading and doesn't stand a chance against any dog with a mouth.
2,Chewers Can Break Up this Toy in Minutes,"My cattle dog was able to chew through one of the rings and begin breaking off pieces in a matter of a few minutes. Because of its ring shape, once the dog is able to start breaking down the plastic, the rest is quickly downhill - they can easily start chewing off big chunks, so beware.This toy would only be good for engaging in tug play and should be put away immediately when done. The material is tough and would probably last through many hours of pulling, but because of its shape, it just can't stand up to chewing."
1,Far from INVINCIBLE - moderate play results in broken rings,"I purchased this because of the description saying it was INVINCIBLE and ""JW's patented molding process links each ring together with no seams and no glue to produce a strong long lasting toy."" My 50 lb. German Shorthair Pointer is far from a Pit Bull, Doberman, Rottweiler, or any other breed that you would think would rip right through any toy given to them. But yet he had the center black ring ripped off from tugging on it within 2 days after he received it as a ""Christmas gift."" After ripping 1 apart, we started playing tug with the remaining rings. He has successfully ripped through the second ring within another week. The rings have 4 indented ""ribbed"" sections per ring, which give them 4 weak points. This is where each of these rings are breaking up.I will go back to Kong toys, which were long-term toys for my previous Doberman and not mess with the lesser competition."
4,Lasted pretty good...,While it only took our pitties (two) about a month or two to break the center ring... That's better than just about any other pull toy.And then the rings themselves have lasted almost a year. One of them JUST broke this week.Pretty damn good toy.
4,"Its not for chewing, its for playing","True, these rings are not ""indestructible"" chewtoys, however I have a big pitbull and she LOVES these things, she can't get enough of them, one set of rings will last her about a year or so, but they aren't for ""chewing"" if she chews on them constantly, yes, she is going to break them up, but more than chewing she loves to play tug of war, sometimes i wish she'd chew on them more, and break them, she can get obsessive about playing with the rings. in any case, its a very interactive toy, but don't get these if you aren't going to be up for playing with your dog a LOT."
1,NOT for aggressive chewers,"I purchased this for my (at that time) ten month old Airedale puppy. Withing a half hour or so, she had a chunk out of one of the rings. I took it away and she proceeded to chew a chunk out of the second ring. I learned my lesson (I had thought that the black ring might be tougher, but it wasn't) and threw the pieces and the remaining intact ring away."
1,Worse toy ever,"Took my lab less than 5 mins to chew through that center ring. This is the first toy he ever chewed through and swallowed a few small pieces ! This ""invincible"" chain just isn't so invincible after all!"
1,Gone in minutes!,"Well, I purchased these Invincible Rings hoping for a long lasting toys. I got home took them out of the package walked into the other room to put drop a few things on the counter, walked back into the room and saw that my puppy (at the time he was only 5 months old) had already eaten the middle ring. That fast! I picked up little pieces for hours. He only took minutes to destroy this toys. I was literally SHOCKED! How can something state it is Invincible and only last minutes! It is not like I have a monster dog, he's a Vizsla.It is pathetic how few toys acutally last. I spend way too much time, and energy looking for a toy last will last longer than a month and this one didn't last 5 minutes. Don't waste your money!"
2,Not for an aggressive chewer,"I have a 7 month Old English Sheep Dog that is very aggressive with her toys. Within 2 hours of having this toy she had chewed big chunks out of the rings. She loves tug a war and this toy is great for that, but not very durable for chewing. If your dog loves to play and doesn't chew then this is a great toy, if not, stay away."
1,Invincible????,It took our Rottie approximately 3 hours to break the first of the rings (rated for extra large dogs) and about 2 days to turn the rest of the chain into teeny tiny little pieces. At a price similar to Kong's they don't even begin to compare...
4,Almost Malinois-proof,"I have three Belgian Malinois dogs (yes, the kind that are used as police K9 and secret service dogs). They love this toy and, other than the black Kongs, it's the only thing that they have not managed to destroy. This toy, however, is much more fun and doesn't smell bad (like the Kongs). They get hours of fun playing tug-of-war with each other. And with the three loops, you can even get three dogs to play on one toy! For some reason, however, the black loop is less ""invincible"" than the yellow ones."
1,CONCH SHELLS AND COWRIES,"If I had got to look at this book I would never have bought it, I thought that it was about Sea Shells, what a lousey book."
2,Holdbacks too fragile,"Two out of three holdbacks arrived broken. They seem to be very fragile and easy to break. Amazon offered to return the product or refund a part of my order so I can buy holdbacks separately. The rod also doesn't seem a great quality.I wouldn't recommend this product. But I recommend Amazon as they are reliable and great with returns. Usually when the product is ""sold by Amazon"" is a quality product. This is a rare occasion when it's not."
4,"The Hiking Trails of Florida's National Forests, Parks, and Preserves","Good book with plenty of trail descriptions for the areas referred to in the title. Doesn't have any maps which is a downside, doesn't go over potential campsites very thoroughly either. All in all a good book. but you'll have to get Florida Trail maps to get a good feel for the hikes in here."
2,green cletic agate bracelet,not as nice as it looked on the site. Way too big for anyones wrist too. It keeps rolling around and does not stay clipped
3,A Life in Iraq,"Born of an Iraqi father and an English mother, the narrator grows up in an atmosphere of discord and dis-ease, never fully belonging to either culture. Joys that she experiences end tragically. Peaceful afternoons spent with her father stop with his untimely death. Her lover goes to war. People die, victims of custom and superstition as much as disease. And finally, she leaves the scenes of destruction in war-torn Iraq for more deaths in London. Horror is piled upon horror, but the narrator remains anonymous, detached from the reader. This novel is a disturbing look at life in a country with which few of its readers may be familiar."
2,Great Coffee but but we have had 2 of 3 units die!,"These DeLonghi coffee makers are gorgeous and make wonderful coffee. They also have a very high mortality rate. What should I expect from Delonghi, though? It's a terrible waste of money as we're on our third purchased unit.It makes a very good and FAST pot of coffee. You absolutely cannot use very fine grind as it will backflow into the water reservoir along with coffee grinds.After much difficulty and hoops to jump through, Delonghi agreed to accept the unit but does not repair nor have them in stock. As a result, after a LONG STRUGGLE, they sent me a different unit entirely. Not as nice and doesn't seem to control the hot water temperature as well. It took me more than a month of fighting with Delonghi to get the mediocre replacement unit.Great while they work, though.BTW, we paid around $60 for each unit, the price is now considerably higher."
1,Stopped Working After 13 Months,"This is a great looking unit that produces wonderful coffee for 13 months! DeLonghi supposedly makes good products, but this is sure not one of them. It stopped working one month after the warranty expiration. Do not waste your money on this. Check some of the other reviews and you will see similar comments from others."
2,Worked great for less than a year,"This product worked great for less than a year. Loved it while it lasted, but for the price I was expecting more than a year out of the product."
1,Piece of Junk,"Stopped working after 2 months of just once a day brewing and meticulous cleaning. Waiting for Amazon to return my money since it was only warranteed by Today's Concept for 30 days. DeLonghi wants me to return this ""piece of junk"" at my expense which I refuse to do. DO NOT BUY THIS. Pay attention to the negative reviews for they have quite a bit of merit. The coffeemaker works very well at first but then it goes kaput for absolutely no reason. It will happen to you also."
1,Faulty Beauty,"Was suckered in by extremely low price point of this great looking coffee pot. Should have paid closer attention to negative reviews. Machine brewed incredible coffee for approx 1 month, at which point it stopped working completely. Efforts to descale resulted in a very flimsy reset switch being stuck within the body of the machine. Very disappointing, and not worth the even greatly reduced price sticker here. Back to my $10 Mr Coffee which has brewed without a glitch for 5 years....."
1,Like a Ferrari,"I could not figure out how to give no stars. This thing starts out great; it's fast, looks cool, and makes a great cup of coffee. AND THEN IT BREAKS ALL OVER YOUR COUNTER!!! Yesterday I put my coffee together, put water in the pot, and the next thing you know the coffee is all over the counter. I cleaned it up, and went to work sans coffee figuring I had somehow neglected to put the coffee pot under the pause button correctly. However, this morning I was very careful and watched as the coffee was made. Imagine my surprise when all I got was steam, a mess on my counter and the lovely smell of burnt plastic and burnt fingers. This maker runs too hot after a time, I guess, and burns out -- kind of like a Ferrari. Don't buy this hunk o junk: and Amazon, you should pull this product before someone gets hurt."
2,cool looking coffeemaker really is disapointing,"i too loved this coffee pot--- for a few months. it made great coffee, faster than most pots. it looked very cool sitting on my counter. i didn't have pot long enough to descale more than twice(the ""needs descaling"" light came on) then one morning my pot made coffee without using all the water. the next day it would not come on at all. it is true,this is a terrible waste of money, even at ""bargain price"" beware !"
2,Great at first... only a few months use before it died.,"This was an excellent coffee maker when I bought it. Took exactly 6 minutes to brew a full pot, and the temp was very close to 200F like it should be. Very attractive. Worked great... for 3 or 4 months. I saw some of the other reviews and thought I'd take a chance at it given the price. Now the little light around the switch comes on, but that's it. No heat to the hot plate, and no movement with the water in the tank. I would not bother with this."
4,Excellent painting kit!,"""Santa"" brought this for my 6-year old daughter who loves horses. She and I each painted a horse together and I found the wooden horses to be quite durable. They are much better made than the plastic versions of horse painting kits and more attractive overall. My daughter is more than satisfied with the product."
4,I think this toy is fun for horselovers!,"I personally, would love this toy. Although that may be bacause I am a horse-lover. I search all horsetoys, and I think it is cool that if you want you can make it a window design, magnet, model, or and thing else YOU want it to be"
3,The Legless Horse,"Taking into consideration the reviews of others that the horses may arrive in pieces, I purchased this item for my niece because she loves horses. It arrived today and -- as warned -- one of the horse legs was broken off. It appears that it can be glued back on without much effort and I will do so before gifting it to my niece, however, this review will add to the fair warnings that your horses too may arrive legless or headless and to be prepared. I expect the product to be well received, but I have given this product an average rating because the consumer should not be responsible for pre-use repairs."
4,Healthy attitude for teen girls,"As a parent,I try to be aware of the stuff my kids listen to. I think this song (and the video) speaks to a young girl's angst over ""love"" betrayed, while not going over the top.(ie, I thought you cared for me alone, but you have another girlfriend, so Leave. Not, ""I thought you cared for me alone, but you have another girlfriend, so I'm going to sleep with your best friend"") The video is refreshingly devoid of nudity, ""dirty dancing"" and profanity."
4,UHH ohhhTHe Great White Hope! The Girl is BAD!!!,"With Mariah going crazy and none out there to rep white SANGERS but Christine, who can blow, JOJO has come in to fill the void! This girl is BAD! She can BLow and she is only 13. She wont follow brtiney for one reason...she can actually sing and not just sing but sang. THis girl is the truth. Her voice is so muture for 13! I am in a state of shock. I went to her websit to hear her other songs, which include a cover of SWV weak, of course SWV did it better but she did not disappoint. She is phenomanal and hopefully will be around alot longer. With talent like this she will!"
1,A Real Hasbeen,JOJO IS A REAL HASBEEN THAT NOBODY KNOWS EXCEPT ALL HER LITTLE DUMBASS WHITE CRONIES WHO ARE TOO STUPID TO EVEN REALIZE SHE HAS NO TALENT! JOJO IS NOWHERE AND HAS SEEMINGLY FALLEN OFF EARTH (NOT SUCH A BAD THING FOR HER)! BYE 1-HIT-WONDER!
1,shes NOT on top. time is up!,"after reading a magazine I have a subscription to, there were has-been charts and ironically jojo came in at #1. thank goodness shes a hasbeen.....the 15 minutes was very harmful to anyone thats not dumb and anyone who knows talent!"
5,JOJO could seriously become the next big thing.,"The Spears family might want to save money on Jamie Lynn's debut album because fellow 13 year old JoJo might just crush her. Joanna Levesque was superb on NBC's America's Most Talented Kid. The only talent better than her that night was Diana Degarmo (who was seriously robbed wednesday night against Fantasia Barrino). JoJo is one of 7 females 16 or younger who are going to have an impact. The other 6 are Diana Degarmo, Rene Olstead, Joelle James, Spensha Baker, Tori Thompson and Tori Kelly. Don't expect Britney's lil sis to create an elite 8."
1,wow....,"seriously...this song blows!! thank god its like her last single, because all her others ones flopped...was this even a hit...or 1 only played on the disney channel? I think smell 1 HIT WONDER, WHICH IS JOJO!!"
1,its okay...we can come out from hiding!,"yahh! the untalented manufacted kiddie star (...) is a 1-hit-wonder! You all know what that means, no more garbage by the untalented (...) it was a close call...for a minute I thought we were attacked with another untalented kiddie star, but she turned into a 1-hit-wonder like all them do (some usually NO-hit-wonders)!jojo disappeared after last summer, so lets keep it that way! bye jojo AKA jomo!"
3,I'd rate it a 3.5 if I could,"1. Leave (Get Out ) [Album Version] - good song. nice lyrics, but yeah, she is too young. 8.5/102. Leave (Get Out ) [Hip Hop Club Mix] - nice mix, but it uses new vocals and they don't sound as great as in the original version. But either way, gives it a cool feel. 7.9/103. Leave (Get Out ) [Dance Mix] -HORRRIBLE!!! I hate it SO MUCH! And this was the whole reason I bought the cd! The music dosn't even match her voice and for a while she's singing with just a basic beat. I am generous in giving it a 3 only because it sounds really good during the 3rd verse. 3/104. Leave (Get Out ) [Main Instrumental] - nice to listen to. It's amazing how much repetition there is in the song when you listen to it without the vocals. Pretty good. 8/105. Not That Kinda Girl - Good song. But definitly one of the weaker songs on her album. 7.5/10Overall: 7/10SHe is NOT A 1-hit WONDER!!!"
5,Great Voice,"I think JoJo has a great voice for her age! I really like the song. It's a song you'd like to dance to. I don't have her single yet, but I have, of course, heard the song before. I hear that people say that she's like another ""Britney Spears"". I don't think so. I think she will do well. And she's only 14, so her voice will mature and I bet she'll be even better!"
1,well well,"haha the untalented bublegum lil prissy manufactured and controlled white girl wannabe ghetto is a 1-HIT WONDER! Thats what she get for getting success and being untalented at that. Her voice is just alright, nothing ""WOW!"" Give us a break JoJo, your fake, dumb, & your career is over!"
5,jo jo,"JoJO is better than any other female singer when it comes to voice work. She rules, simple as that. Her single is amazing she's a prodigee. If at 13 she's so good she can only get better. She has so much talet. If she's so good now, in 10 years she's going to be superb. She is so good she may be fake. Anyway, I'm off to listen to Get Out again."
1,WHATTABOUT THE MOVIE?!,"right before she became a 1-hit-wonder, (...) she was going to be in a movie. look how far that went...1 hit and then boom...your gone! thank goodness all her other stuff after flopped! she can only be found on those baby kiddie channels...where all no-hit-wonders or 1-hit-wonders kiddie wannabe stars go.....wow...jojo is such (...)"
1,"It's not about saying ""no"" to sex","I think this song is awful but I just wanted to make sure everyone didn't think the song was about girls saying ""no"" to an pushy boyfriend. The song is about (what else?) a relationship gone bad. And this is another one of those bland watered-down comercialized songs that the recording industry is shoving down people's throats."
2,There's no way,"I just saw the promo clip for Leave Get Out. It is horrible. There is no way this child sang THIS song. I know what studio trickery can do, but this has to be bogus. It's bad enough I had to hear this song playing at the gym every damn day (time to change gyms, I know), but her inability to make a good video for it has pushed me over the edge. I hope she never makes another video or recording for that matter. And what kind of stage name is ""JoJo""? Sounds like a track-working ho if you ask me."
1,Puhlease!,To think that someone would even compare or (gasp) state that JOJO is better than Christina or Hilary is a joke. But i can imagine her on a level with Britney: THEY HAVE ZERO TALENT!
3,Abe Segal Hero Worship,"Amusing tales, spoilt by incessant references and anecdotes relating to Abe Segal - almost a biography of Abe.!Worth the read if you are a tennis fanatic, particularly if you are a fan of dear old Abe Segal."
2,Money Better Spent,"I got this gun when i was fist getting into airsoft and i really liked the adaptability and reliability of it and to this day it still works as well as it ever did. The magazine is very well designed and is one of the better spring mags I've seen. However this gun has one huge negative which is that it is outrageously inaccurate. Not only are the sights unusable (both the fake red dot or the iron sights), even when held straight the bb's fly all over the place. Seriously, every single clear plastic spring pistol I've used has been more accurate and a better airsoft gun than this one; any AEG, even the super cheap ones will trump this gun."
3,"long lasting, not so long range","i've had this gun for about 4 years now, and although it sucks now, i give it credit for lasting this long. the actual gun itself is nice, the flashlight is too lol, but you will never have a very good ""performing gun"", but it will last"
5,No-Work Garden Book,"I love this book. I am reading it for the second time now. Ms. Stout's writing is fun and there are so many things to soak in. The concept of year-round mulching is easy but I want to learn all of her gardening secrets. I have been gardening organically for 30 years quite successfully, but I didn't really mulch my vegetable or herb garden much. I tried newspaper and compost as mulch and never did I use hay. I am in my second year of gardening Ruth Stouts no work gardening method and I can not say enough about it. I am excited! I no longer till or dig in my garden, because I don't have to!. I tell everybody about it. I get some of the same reactions at Ruth did that she describes in her book. That is, disbelief that it is such a great idea. I ignor them. You will love this book as much as I do. I highly recommend it!"
4,"Comfy, but Noisy Shoes","These shoes are comfy and look great with casual clothes. The only problem is the buckle rattles when you walk, so everyone around will know when you are coming their way!"
2,Oh! the Temptation!,"Tempted by super-vamipres, when I got around to running an Elysium game it was a total disaster. I would suggest this book only to those serious roleplayers who can create monstrously powerful characters and not get into a single barfight with them. You really need to know your stuff to make this one work!"
5,a wonderful book,"I got this book at our local library and loved it so much that I had to buy it. I've loved boxes my entire life and can hardly throw one away. I'm so excited about the prospect of making my own boxes in any size, shape and color that I want. I've looked through a few books on this subject, but this is the book I'll start off with. I appreciate her exacting yet easy techniques and recommendations for the best materials, like Davey board instead of lesser cardboards that will warp. She also gives a technique for making your own bookcloth which excites me as a quilter/sewer."
3,"This book is reprinted inside another book ""Making Memory Books and Journals by Hand""","The book, ""Making Memory Books and Journals by Hand,"" appears to have the exact same text and pictures, for less money. And, it has two other books' text and pictures as well."
3,Making Memory Boxes,"The Making Memory Boxes book has lots of good projects to make. Some of the instructions are not as detailed as I am used to, and I've had a hard time recreating the projects in the book.The photos are a great reference & I use them as ideas to inspire me."
3,"Not as Good as Hoped, but Good Enough","I bought this book for myself, to help me reflect on how to handle the difficulties that frequently enter my life. By far, the best chapter is the one written by Joni Eareckson Tada. No one knows desperation like she does. Her chapter alone is worth the price of the book."
3,Review,"These are cheaper than real Birks, but quality is not the same. I've had these for over two weeks now and I noticed that the glue on the inside of the clog comes off with normal wear. It is irritating to be walking and have chunks of glue adhere to your socks. I won't wear these without socks because I don't know what's in the glue from China. They look great and I get a lot of compliments on the appearance. They are a decent clog, but after I kill these I will go back to Birks."
1,uncomfortable,"These shoes were very uncomfortable. Hard, un-forgiving soles. I have loved Birks in the past, but these were horrible. Returned them."
1,Gaps... everywhere.,"Luckily, I picked up this book from the library. Naturally, it seemed that the book had potential, however failed to live up to it. Although a few of the other reviews have covered the majority of the problems, let me just sum them up: David spent almost all of the book thinking that Callie was crazy and flaky (which, for the most part she was) then, for the rest of the book, he believed himself to be out of his mind. The girl that David had been seeing for three years, who he had been living with for two, was engaged to him for most of the book also, way after meeting Callie. And his fiancée was the one who broke off the wedding. The time periods in the book were also pretty random- I would think that a mere day has passed when it turns out that it really was two weeks. Also, the whole magic thing did not work whatsoever in this book. Being a big fan of chick lit, I have to say I was disappointed. Definitely skip this one."
3,Only half-way there,"I have to agree with the April 3, 2003 review: this book might have been a light-hearted agreeable diversion were it not for the silliness of it all. The plot has magical potential, but it just isn't enough."
1,Silly for certain,"As noted in the previous review, this book was contrived; it was also vacuous and just plain silly. It made me REALLY regret my rule of finishing every book I start. The plot was completely implausible. Seldom have I read such an unsatisfactory book about such irresponsible, childish, and unbelievable characters."
5,Must have for French class!,"When I started my French class, I had the textbook and the workbook. I decided that it would be good to get a French dictionary. This dictionary has been great. I have learned several new words that I won't have learned in class. Using the concepts for verb conjugation in class, I was able to apply what I had learned to the words I was looking up in the dictionary.The back of the dictionary has a section on French verbs. Since that has been my major weakness, I thought that it was a great resource for studying."
5,Weldbond glue,"An incredible glue to use with glass mosaics. Waterproof, no smell, strong, non-toxic, I have been using it for years. No other product like this on the market. The only drawback is that it dries quickly, and tends to form a skin that you have to throw out if you expose too much of it to the air. Despite this, an amazing product."
3,"Basically, it’s Elmer’s","Weldbond Universal Adhesive seems to work just fine for paper and cardboard. Not so much for metals (I tried it on brass model assemblies) and on plastics it’s just ok. Though messier and requiring some speed and agility, I like 5-minute epoxy for plastics and metals. As for the Weldbond, I can’t tell the difference between it and Elmer’s in terms of adhesive ability. Even its color, texture and smell are the same."
4,Very portable - more usable than the Classic,"I wanted something that I could keep on a keychain that would still be useful for (say) peeling apples at lunch out. The Ambassador is very portable and doesn't add bulk to a pocket already filled with a cellphone and keychain. The knife itself is a small (a trade-off for compactness), but it is more useful than the Classic knife."
2,"low sound level, unimpressive sound quality","The sound from these speakers is quite unimpressive. The volume level is very low. I wanted these so I could have my ""B"" speakers out on the deck, and my ""A"" speakers still playing in the house. These speakers are so much quieter than my stereo's normal speakers, that it can't be done. In order to have adequate volume outside on these speakers, the volume would have to be set so the indoor speakers were blaring. So I have to turn off the ""A"" (indoor) speakers when I play these speakers outside since the volume has to be cranked up to get the same sound."
3,Rack for entertainement center,"Bought these to build a custom rack for my Home Theater. Racks rails are strong and appear well made. But, the holes are not spaced to normal standards and do not line up with standard 19"" rack shelves or rack mounted equipment. The holes also do not fit the standard 10-32 mounting screws. Plan to do some drilling and customizing if you purchase these."
3,The Gunnywolf,"This story is a cute retelling of an old folktale but the version ""The Gunniwolf"" retold by Wilhelmina Harper is superb. Unfortunately, it is out of print."
2,Does not sound promising,"I haven't listened to this album in its entirety---I just listened to the snippets available on this web page. Listening to the snippets was enough to tell me not to buy this.There are two versions of ""Ne me quitez pas,"" on this album--one by Dusty Springfield and one by Nina Simone. I am curious as to why the album's producers seem to disguise this fact by providing the title once in English and once in French. It's a great song, but why two different versions? Are they trying to fool an unsuspecting buyer?Bowie's ""In the port of Amsterdam"" is a great recording, but you are better off getting it on the ""Bowie Rare"" album. Here it is packaged with a bunch of schlocky, over-produced, lesser Brel songs. The snippets here sound like moddish 60s recordings that have aged poorly.Two stars--because ""Ne me quitez pas"" is a great song, and the Bowie recording is worth owning. The rest really sounds shamefully bad."
1,Call Gilsson before buying,"I shopped for a new Magellan GPS on their website and found one. Under accessories was listed this Gilsson universal amplified antenna. My new GPS was listed as working with antenna.It does not work with the 9055 Magellan GPS, and possibly a few other Magellan units. THE MAGELLAN WEBSITE IS WRONG IN IT'S APPLICATION LIST. CALL GILSSON BEFORE BUYING TO CONFIRM THE APPLICATION.Anyway, as usual, Amazon was the cheapest for the GPS and the antenna. I have returned the antenna to Amazon for a refund.I cannot truly state that the antenna is defective in any way because it will not fit my GPS."
3,cute but not big enough,"The case is cute and a pretty shade of pink, however, it isn't big enough to hold anything other than the DS and a couple of games. There is no room for the charger or earphones."
5,La Sainte bible,"Excelente, un tamaño muy manejable y un tamaño de letra justo, la presentacion en vinil la hace ligera y resistente asi como un aspecto muyagradable a la vista y al tacto."
5,Excellent purchase,"This was a great purchase! While learning another language, it is often helpful to read something you already know the meaning of to see which words speakers of that language choose to express that meaning. It is also cool to read the Bible in another language because it reminds you of the universal nature of God. This Bible is great for these purposes, and it arrived as advertised!"
5,Perfect for my 1 yr old,We never saw the wizard of song episodes or the ghost band one. The chimps in charge (was) my LO favorite so it was a pretty good combo for us! Also nice to have a few back to back so I can get some stuff done around the house.
5,Grandkids Love IT,"I have to admit to being a Fresh Beat Band fan. I watch it everyday with my grandkids. Ask me to sing the ""Bananas"" song...I can do it."
5,Plausibly supernatural & a fine character-driven mystery,"Nobody has done a better job of bringing the ""lost"" supernatural dimension of primitive folk magic and religion into the modern mystery/thriller world than Michael Gruber. He has a deep and sympathetic understanding of what we secular Westerners might regard as ""alternative belief systems,"" and he manages to seamlessly juxtapose witchcraft, Santeria, etc., with utterly plausible crime and violence plotlines. Additionally, few authors in the thriller genre can match Gruber's ability to flesh out characters -- even bit players -- in three dimensions. By now it's well-known that Gruber is the ghostwriter responsible for the first 13 crime novels ""authored"" by his cousin, Robert K. Tanenbaum, which are among the very best of the genre. I will read anything he writes."
4,Plus one star for the CD audiobook,"Night of the Jaguar is smooth and fast and consistently entertaining. In this review I want to take special note of Jonathan Davis' audio performance.I have heard more than a hundred audiobooks. It is a distinct art form. Davis is the best reader I have ever heard. Each character in the large cast has a clearly identifiable speaking voice, precisely appropriate to age, gender, background, and ethnic origin. The voices never bleed into the narration, nor vice versa. Even sound effects - in this case, the menacing breathy growl of the Jaguar - are perfect.Congratulations to Michael Gruber for a fine, intelligent supernatural mystery, and to Jonathan Davis for a performance that captures it in living color."
5,All the Jimmy Paz novels are great,"The three Jimmy Paz novels by Gruber are all worth reading. My favorite aspect of them is how they explore the line between objective science and the mystical. Be sure to read them in chronological order. They not only entertain, but give you a look at the spiritual side of the world and how spirituality can take many forms. Voodoo rituals, ethno-botany, shape shifting shamans, a nun who has no compulsion about shooting bad guys, and they all take place in Miami (where else?)."
4,Worth the read,"Aside from the obligatory descriptions of frolicking in the bedroom, this is a fun read. The author has a rich vocabulary which is refreshing in works of this type. As with all the books in this series, fantastic and outrageous scenarios have a certain amount of credibility to them."
4,so cool,This book was so engaging and interesting. The characters are well built and the storyline is tremendously entertaining!!!! I highly recommend this book.
3,A faint sense of disappointment,"I was looking forward to renewing my acquaintance with Jimmy Paz and his engaging wife Lorna. Well - practically no Lorna in this book, some sloppy editing turned her into ""Lola"". Her parents have disappeared in the process. To be fair, the story is well told and as credible as the genre allows. But Jimmy and Lorna/Lola are almost incidental to this tale of supernatural jungle beings bent on protecting their world."
2,Poor at best,"Who was the genius who thought printing musical notation on a parchment coloured page was a good idea? It's virtually illegible in its current form. That's what happens when you let the marketing people get hold of what is, at it's core, a technical document. You don't get school textbooks printed on parchment.But that is just quibbling. If you want the licks, completely transcribed solos (instead of the ""easy guitar"" versions) and, importantly, solos in other instruments transcribed to tabs for guitar then look elsewhere. This book gives you exactly what you can get for free off the web, basic chord arrangements. If you're looking for some insight into what NY is actually playing then look elsewhere.At best this is disappointing."
1,Save the ten bucks and buy a better stethoscope,This stetho comes with small hard ear tips or soft large ones which most likely affects the quality of sound- but I wish I had just saved the ten bucks and paid more for a better stetho. I can't even hear well enough to take blood pressure with this model.
3,Costume,"Perfect for a costume, i put them on and i felt like my head being split. Great for a novelty :)"
3,"Great Narration, Bad Facts","Any sports fan (especially from the Chicago area) will definitely enjoy this story of growing up as a fan in Chicago. The only thing that keeps me from giving this book 4 stars is the inaccuracies. In several instances, Simon gives incorrect scores, dates and places. You would think it would be easy for someone in his position to have the correct info, so this unfortunately distracted me from an otherwise fine read."
3,"Started Strong, But","One of the earlier reviewers commented on this otherwise fine sports memoir descending into too much about Jordan and the Bulls. I agree completely. The first part is great, but then Simon sort of rides off into this seemingly never ending adulation of everything Jordan/Bulls. I resorted to serious skimming near the end."
5,Terrific,"This book is terrific, even if you don't live in chicago. It provides a back story of what is going on in the world and in a family as the sports memories are made. Lovely, touching and very funny."
2,Have to agree with the reader from Michigan,"I don't get this story. I don't understand the raves. This is a throwback to all things the romance genre has tried to rise above. Neandrethal hero. Clueless heroine. Please, could we have characters who belong in the current decade? Who have some sort of redeeming and admirable qualities? I had to double check the copyright date to see if this was maybe an older reissue - like from the 1980s or something. Yikes. Run away!"
2,Take a step back women's liberation!,"Let me start out by saying that I do not particularly consider myself to be an advocate of women's lib. However, this novel seemed to throw the concept that a woman does, in fact, have a brain in her head back to the Stone Age. I did not like how Riley treated Red. And I like even less how Red didn't stand up for herself. This is the stereotypical romance novel with the tall, dark and handsome man making the full, round and in this case red-headed woman wonder how she ever lived without him. Rubbage!"
4,Riley good!,"After featuring Ethan in Men of Courage, Ms. Foster turns to Riley Moore, an ex-SWAT and now crime-scene technician as the perfect alpha-male to cosy up to journalist Regina Foxworth. His protective instincts are alerted when someone has threatened Regina's life with arson, a side-swipe and a near-fatal sabotage to her new home. Riley believes teaching her defenses skill and her buying a feisty chihuahua isn't going to safeguard her life - and he suggests moving in with him. That's too close for comfort for Regina because her jerk-of-an-ex thinks her frigid and Riley's charms has infiltrated all her defenses. Lori Foster's latest may not be comparable to her excellent Impetuous but you know you cannot go wrong with a frosty read that guarantees quality entertainment with her immensely amicable characters like fireman Ethan, Rosie, Buck and Harris. Top it up with sizzling chemistry and the equation turns up to be a Riley good read."
3,its so so,it works fairly well but sucks down battery even with solar panel charging battery. one of two was dead on arrival. found a manufactured steel cage thats works better and cheaper too.
2,Packs a wallop!!!,This item does shock the heck out of you if you touch the feeder even with the battery disconnected. I guess it stores a charge for a while. :) I like the idea behind this item but the problem I had was that it kept my feeder battery drained even with a solar charger. I finally took them all off and bought cages. End of problem. I would not recommend this item unless you want to keep recharging your batteries every couple of weeks.
5,Very Good,This was a fun project. I now have a beautiful memorial of my beloved dog.Be patient and allow the cement to set up before doing paw prints-if too soft will not work. Plenty of time to do the art work.
2,Not as easy as it looks,"I found this kit messy and difficult. I think I added too much water, although I did follow the directions to add one cup. Then I think I tried doing the paw prints too early, although I followed the instructions stating that you could do them immediately. My dog got stressed out because I put her paws in the mixture so many times to try and get a better print. I'd recommend adding the cup of water a little at a time and then waiting a bit to do the print. I admit that I'm not very artistic so perhaps other people would get better results!"
3,alittle disappointed,i got these as a gift two years ago...they are starting to break now...the knife part is coming away from the handles...can't even cut soft cheese with them anymore...very disappointed with them....gave them a three because they did last me acouple years and for the price i guess that is not a bad deal
2,FLIMSY,"I have had these knives for about 2 years now. Just the other night I was slicing cold butter, from the refrigerator, and the blade broke in half. From slicing BUTTER!!! Me and my hubby have been looking real close at the break line....maybe we can see the Virgin Mary's profile or something!! Maybe sell it on ebay and make thousands!! LOL Then we can buy a better set!! LOL"
2,Stopped Holding a Seal After a Few Uses,"I was hoping to use this to keep coffee beans fresh which means a lot of sealing and unsealing. This product worked great for the first few times then it stopped holding a seal after a few days, then a day, then a few hours, now it won't seal at all.I owned the 1st generation containers and those were junk too. When will Tilia get it right?"
2,Annoying tone,This guy over stresses syllables making it super annoying to listen to. I felt like I was listening to a big nerd.
3,Just Ok,"It works the way it should, feels cheap, and does not come as pictured. The product is white not gray. Most important to know is that it is only for computers. I purchased for my phone because it states the fact that it has 3.5mm plug. Well it should say plugs, and mention that it is solely for computers."
3,Its strictly ok,"Its strictly ok for the price you are paying.The headphones can get uncomfortable after an hour or so, if you have a bigger head , you'd experience it.The sound quality is pretty good and the microphone is ok.If you are short on money and you need a headphone with mic , this is a good value buy."
4,Great Headphones,The sound is great. I don't normally use headphones... but when I did I am glad I chose these. My only small complaint is they are not the most comfortable when laying on a pillow. I knew this before buying them however.
1,Dissapointed,I can't belive that this item does not work i mean how can you have a product for sale that does not work. I would like to know whats the next step in getting back my money????
1,Dont buy this!!!,"If you want to use the microphone, better dont buy this. The other persons i speak with always hears lots of noise. I changed to one of the Logitech ones.. and i got comments, like.. i can hear you as if you are speaking next to me..So buy this only if u dont wanna speak.. and just use it as a cheap headphone"
4,Good product,Good product; just was negatively surprised because I got a white rather than black/silver phone. Good value for money tough.
5,Awesome head piece,"Great sound and voice over on the computer is wonderful.They should cost as much as the best ones they make.For the money dont hesatate to purchase them,you wont be Disappointed"
1,Don't Buy!,"Although the sound is fine, themicrophone is flimsy.I bought 12 of them for my students and 4 of the microphones have broken, exposing a sharp screw."
3,ok,these are ok headphones but the thing you speak into broke off and i didnt have them that long at all
4,"Great sound and not heavy to carry around, good balance between price and quality",Not too much to say but I have to recommend this headphone to anybody who is not looking for something too heavy/big when taking into consideration sound quality and cost. This is just the headphone you need at this price!!!!
5,Coby Headset Mic CVM361,"Awesome finally i buy the right ones! Ive bought many inexpensive mic headsets in the last year and i am finally pleased with these. I love Coby products to begin with. They are comfortable and so is the price, sound and voice quality both a ten."
5,"Good, Inexpensive Headset","Very comfortable and useful headset, with good cushions to keep what you are hearing private and to block some outside noise."
3,Good Product For The Price,"Looks good, I got a couple of comments on the white cover from people I was webconferencing with. The microphone has decent reception and sensitivity. The headphones are alright for webcams, I wouldn't use it for music though. For the price, a pretty good product. The fit can be a little odd. Took me a while to find a comfortable fit."
4,just not comfortable enough,"This is a cheap headphone with microphone. I like the look of it. But it does not fit my head well, maybe because my head's so small. It does not cover my ears very well. Of course I bought it to make sure I would not disturb others while listen to the music or radio, etc. Anyway, the sound is good and the color is good too."
3,Good Speakers but horrible Microphone!!,"The sound quality is very good, specially for the price you pay.The Microphone is really poor quality, lots of Echo, Static and tunnel voice which renders it unusable. So buy separate Mic..Fast shipping and good price..I'm using it only as speakers. Not that comfortable after using it for several minutes."
2,Do not buy it,"The comfortability is not even worth its $8 price, after a few minutes your ears with start to hurt. The mic first of all, has bad quality, and secondly the wire stopped working after about 3 weeks. Btw, the real headset looks nothing like the picture displayed, the one displayed actually looks like an actual headphone. The real one looks like an obvious cheap $10- headphone."
1,Noisy microphone,"Bad design that not fit with my ears. Very NOISY microphone, sometime noiselessly. Pay a little more for the better one."
3,Worked pretty well for 3 months,"The headset gives decent quality sound but the mic jack started giving problems after about 3 months of normal use, causing interference and inconsistent sound on skype calls. The rubber insulation on the connection has started to come apart already - obviously not great quality. I would have hoped for better attention to this aspect when it's main purpose/design is for web communication."
4,:),i love this item as i open the box and put it on test it with my ipod i wanted to order and more but didnt cause my phone carry all ma music now.... love it :)
2,"Headset useful, microphone terrible",I use Dragon Naturally Speaking for work and was looking for a headset that would record with clarity. When I ran the microphone test through Dragon this headset FAILED. When I listened to the playback there is a terrible low pitched hum throughout the recording. I am shocked since this item is marketed as right for gaming systems.Will look to possibly return if worth the money. If not I'll use it for listening only.Went back to my cheap headset with microphone.Very disappointed.
1,Didn't last,My 13 year old used them for online school. They were broke within 1 week. First the sound went out on one side and then the other side quite a few days later.
2,Fifty-fifty,"I bought two of these headsets knowing that they were not going to be the best but at least sufficient for occasional use. Since I was currently using some other cheapy headset I didn't use these until 5 months after I bought them, when the old one broke. The first Coby headset lasted only 4 days. I was surprised. After four days only one side had sound. I tried the second pair that I bought and it has been working for a few months with occasional use. If you need something that will last or above average sound quality, then buy something else, these are not that great for every day use. No comment on the microphone."
2,Not bad for short term use,"I used this as a headset for Ventrilo communication for online gaming as well as listening to music while just surfing the web to tune out my husband watching TV.The mic picked up my voice just fine and the sound quality was pretty good for such a cheap set of headphones, no complaints. It wants to look a little more expensive than it is and I think aesthetically it's not a bad headset, either.However, after one hour of continuous use, it became downright painful to continue to wear this - during longer periods of gaming I would find myself constantly shifting it trying to find some relief from the relentless pressure this put on my ears and the sides of my head. I do wear glasses, so this could have affected the fit, but it was so painful to use for extended periods it's now sitting in my desk drawer while I use an older headset that never had the same problem."
1,Not worth it... it should be sold for free!,"I couldn't afford the expensive headphones w/ microphone so I bought these. I regret buying these headphones because after five minutes of using them, my ears were in pain.The design is very awkward. It compresses your ears on both sides.The microphone seems pretty useless because when I tried talking to people, the voice clarity was so bad that they couldn't hear a single thing I was saying.The biggest thing:After 1 month of using them, I am having problems with its amplifier. I can hear sound only one side. When I move the amplifier [volume control] than I hear sound from both sides. But it lasts only few seconds...I have taken good care of these headphones but I regret paying even few dollars. It wasn't worth it!"
4,"Safe, tame and well worn as a Sunday service","This book is for church members or those who want a sermon in book form. No disparagement intended. I have no doubt the author is a Biblical scholar and it shows. This book is not intended to break new ground or reach out to people not already church members. I was looking for new, original interpretations of scripture and didn't find it here. I did find a book with some new ideas and interpretations:The Bible Is A Parable: A Middle Ground Between Science and Religionwhich not only freshly reinterprets the parables of the Bible, but adds new material in the form of stories and analysis."
5,Quick reference for recovery from burnout,"For Christians interested in a Biblical viewpoint of the subject of burnout, this book covers all the basic issues, offering encouragement, hope and a plan for recovery. It is thorough yet concise, addressing the key issues for people in burnout. Highly recommended."
5,Another very well-written novel,"Mr Hamilton continues his trend of excellent mystery writing with this his fifth book. His forte is having the protagonist find people who have disappeared. In this book, it is a double helping. After helping one of his friends find his missing brother, the hero has to go back out and find his friend who also disappears. As usual, the writing is excellent, the story flows beautifully, the characters are developed and believable, and the whole story feels real. Each book develops his characters a little further. Read this series in order for maximum enjoyment.My only complaint is like slapping at waves at the beach. When authors use the phrase ""went missing"" or ""gone missing"" instead of ""disappeared"" it makes my mind cringe. While the terms may be marginally acceptable in the Ebonics language, I think it is poor English.I know, petty, petty.It is a great book, it is a great series of books. Read them all and enjoy yourself."
1,Awful,"I got this book at my local library. Tried reading it, ended up laughing at how poorly it is written. Loads of sentence fragments, and pointless story changes. Awful book, I can't even say how happy I am that I checked this out of the library, instead of wasting my money on it."
4,Best of the series so far,"I found this to be the best of the series that I have read so far. I still have the two most recently published to read. Thankfully Mcknight has stopped being so morose as he was in previous books. His self pity and whining gets a little old after a few books.Like all of Hamiltons books, the mystery isn't solved until the last few chapters and then we get some totally new info popping up that clears everything up. In this case it was the fire that killed some kids many years before. This was info unknown for the entire book. Mcknight of course didn't look for the common thread because he was too busy driving back and forth from remote Ontario to MI and getting bailed out of jail.But that's Mcknights character. He ain't the brightest sleuth out there as we know from past books.In all I recommend this one."
1,Boring,"Despite significant effort on my part I could not finish this novel - it was just too boring. Chapter after chapter went by and nothing caught the attention of my imagination. Flat characters, tedious scene descriptions, flaccid style -- I can't imagine how Hamilton has earned a reputation as a good writer. There are too many excellent mysteries on the market to waste time with this mediocrity. I give it an F."
1,Horrible purchase,Horribly disappointed. The sound quality is mediocre. Fit is not good at all. The SONY headphones that I bought 7 years ago for 5$ have way better sound quality and fit.
1,Easily Broken,"I bought these after buying an Ipod because the in the ear design is very frustrating, the first time the wire yanked out of the base when I turned my head to one side, I returned them and when I received my second pair, I removed them from the box and one of the over the ear hook was already snapped off, I'm returning these as well, and this time I'll take the refund instead of the replacement, bought my first pair of these 2 weeks ago...they have a very non-flexible design"
1,great if you have tiny ears,these headphones have very good speakers and I imagine the soft rubber that goes around your ears would be very comfortable to people with child-size ears; but I do not and the adjustability of the earclip is maybe a quarter inch- nowhere near aligning properly with my ear (I swear I do not have huge ears).
3,More Range,This item is somewhat uncomfortable to wear. The clip part doesn't extend nearly far enough for it to sit comfortably around my ear.
2,"Comfortable Fit, Weak Sound","These are more comfortable than my former set of Phillips clip-on headphones, but the sound quality is much poorer. Not worth the price."
4,Convenient & good for family use,"I like these because I find them comfortable, and they are small and easy to carry in my purse to use with my iPod. The other thing that's great about this design is that I can clip one earphone each on two children and let them watch a kid video on the iPod together, when we're waiting for food at a restaurant or sitting somewhere else where those little Sesame street videos or whatever come in handy."
2,lame head phones,"i usually like these type of clip on head phones for work, and i thought since they were ""Phillips"", that they would be quality... i sit at a desk on the computer, and these things will barely stay on. the sound is great when they actually stay attached to my ear. sorry phillips, you need to come up with something better."
5,My favorite way to listen. :),"Ear buds give me dermatitis... bulky ear phones give me headaches... some ear clips hurt. These are excellent, comfortable, and with good sound. Thanks!"
1,Wonderful but flimsy,"I love, love, love ear clips...but be careful with these. Wrap around headbands are heavy, hurt my neck, and mess with my hair. Earbuds are just painful. these ear clips are so comfortable and the sound quality is excllent, however, the cord is also extremely delicate. i have broken more then one pair within the first few weeks of purchasing them. There is another version in this same family; they are white and the cord is sturdier then the balck ones. the fabric on the ear clips of the white one isn't as soft, but they are just as nice as the black ones but without breaking as easily. seriously, they are really delicate so if you are prone to getting the cord caught on anything, dont get them - opt for the white!"
3,could do more,the controller is fine for the money. I would love to operate two zones at a time but it will not allow it.
4,Irrigation Timer,"This product is excellent. Non-volatile memory, ease of programming, schedule flexibility. The only problem is the large case size...takes up a lot of wall space with the provision for additional solonoids (I do not know anyone having more than six watering stations)."
1,For the Desperate Only,"The sole advatage of buying these dice is that they are sold at your local chain bookstore. The instructions are obtuse and redundant, and the dice are cheap, small, and only one of each type is provided. Advice: take your ~[$$] to a hobby store and pick out your own dice or failing that buy for [$$] the D&D; introduction game that includes the same identical dice, and get a few goodies as well.As a note it sickens me when for the price they charge for cheap, [discount chain store] quality dice they couldn't throw in another set, or at the bare minimum include the 10-00 10 sided die as a complement to the 10 sided dice that comes with the 'System dice.'"
3,"Colorful, functional, and a bit overpriced.","This set of dice is identical to the set that comes with the D&D Adventure game, except this set includes a purple percentile die. For those who aren't familiar with the adventure game, the dice are: an orange d20, a yellow d12, a green d10, a purple percentile die, a blue d8, a red d6, and a black d4. The inking on all the dice is white, except for the d12 which has black inking. The free adventure isn't very good. These dice are more expensive than what you'll find at deidcated game stores."
2,Worth it?,"I would have to say that if you were going to get a dice set there are many different places online that sell products like the ""Pound-O-Dice"" that will have all the die you need to play this and many other games. THere are more die that would be usefull that don't come in this set either, such as the D3. It is used within the D&D games and other for that matter. To be Honest I have got this set and find that it is sadley lacking on the rules side and I found myself buying the comple DMG, PHB and Monstrous Manual before my second setion of AD&D. So just a point get the core rule books and a good LARGE set of dice if you are really interested in playing, and if your not sure find a group to try it out with first."
3,Useful But Could've Been Better!,"The basic tools were given. Basically the dice. However, it seems like Wizard's of the Coast would have provided a more in depth explanation for new comer's to the d20 system to make it more user friendly. Like d20 For Dummies."
4,Fast to Get,"I don't live in the USA, so getting some dice is very hard, especially when my friends are thinking on getting themselves some. So i told them to get this box that is cheap compared to the price of the trip to the nearest gaming store, and they are available in the bookstore around the corner. Yea, you may complain about the expensive, but some people don't have the time to go looking fo the final gaming store/website where to find the good products, they just want to start playing. That is what this set is all about."
1,dont waste your money,"Very outdated and condescending. Perhaps this is attributable to the translator. I hope so. In once instance, MTFs are referred to as ""pathetic."" I threw this in the garbage today and will hopefully forget I ever bought it and read it."
2,Beware the Unpredictable Warranty,"Bought a set of these for my automatic entry gate. They worked fine for about 18 months, then they developed an issue with a dirty relay that caused them to hold the gate open a few times a week, letting our animals escape. I was really glad this unit had a two-year warranty, until I was informed of the fine print. The manufacturer starts the warranty clock on the day the unit is delivered to the dealer. While your unit sits on his shelf, your warranty ticks away. You have no control over how old the unit is that they're going to ship you, so you don't know how much warranty you'll have on the unit when it arrives. The manufacturer doesn't sell directly to consumers, so there's no way around it. Buyer beware."
3,Good BUT... no choice with scent!,I'm a big fan of Mrs. Meyer's products and love the geranium scented dish soap. I thought a candle would be a nice way to get that scent everywhere in our apartment so I was excited to purchase this on Amazon. Unfortunately I received the lavender candle! I noticed other reviewers mentioned that you don't get what you ordered so I suppose I should've known. The lavender is nice and it's a nice candle that burns evenly and not too strongly so I'll probably keep it.BUT... why won't they send what you order?!?!
3,Meh,"It doesn't smell like lavender but it's nice. It mostly just smells sweet. If you are looking for a lavender smell, this isn't it."
2,Smells ok - but it does not smell anything like Lavender,"Maybe it is me, but the lavender candle does not even remotely smell like any lavender I've every smelled. It's sort of a sweet, soapy smell.Oh well, maybe another brand."
1,Better than the room spray but not by much,"This is supposedly genuine lavender but the fragrance is overwhelmed by the addition of orange peel. It is not as horribly unplesant as the lavender room spray that smells like a rotting orange, but it is not worth buying again. I'll be going back to imported French lavender candles."
4,great candle....without burning!,"I needed a candle that would provide a nice scent in the bathroom, without having to light it. This candle provides a fresh clean scent all day long! Not to overpowering...just right!"
1,HATE it. Does not smell like lavender at all.,"I realize smells are subject to personal opinions... so others may love the scent... but I hate it. It does NOT smell like lavender, I can assure you of this (regardless of your nose). I own several lavender products, including FRESH DRIED Lavender and essential oils. This candle smells like floor cleaner or lemon or ... I am not even sure.It reminds of the smell of the bathroom at the rest stop at the Maryland house on i-95.I wish I could return it, but I already lit it, hoping that it would smell different as it burns. Maybe it smells gross because it's soy based, but I have 4 other soy candles that do not smell like that made by different brands.Do not buy this candle if you want lavender. I'm telling you, it does not smell like lavender.Who knows, maybe someone will like the scent. Scents are just so subjective... and the subject of this review is: Gross!"
1,Incredibly bad scent,"I've never purchased Mrs. Meyer's candles prior to this but have been using the liquid soap for a few years, so was surprised at the scent when I opened the lid. It's difficult to describe, but it doesn't smell like lavender. I opened it and left it out, and my husband begged me to get rid of it. Not impressed in the least."
5,Great soy candle,"These are my favorite candles...they smeel great and last a long time. I have the geranium candle and hand soap in my bathroom and always get compliments on how nice it smells. Plus, I like Mrs. Meyer's natural products...good for the earth."
1,Didn't receive the correct candle!,I was sent gardenia instead of lemon verbana and had to throw it away after lighting it once because of allergies. So disappointing!
4,Go Funk Yourself Rulz,"The only thing that I did not like about this movie is the main event is not that great. Sabu and Terry put a good match but not as good of a match that they had in ECW. The King of the Deathmatch match is the best mach on the movie it is Supreme vs The Messiah and the weapons used in the match is all worth it(very bloody,but great)everything that you can think of is used in this king of the deathmatch. The three way war Webb vs Jimmy vs Kronus this is buy far the best 3 way match I have ever seen, it is a very good match.and the rest of the card is very good.It is the best XPW video out there right now(from what I have seen)So I suggest you to go out there and purchese this video right away because it is the best.XPW!XPW!XPW!"
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"If you are an SAP consultant, this books is not for you. It may give you some superficial information on supply chain if you a SAP user, but I think one of your SAP core team IT folks may be able to teach you that in a few hours. So, don't waste your money on this book, just talk to your SAP support team if you want to understand the process, or pick up another book that would really teach you supply chain management."
3,some comments,Sincerely I was thinking this book was more hands on tool than a theoretical review on supply chain. Even though those concepts are very important I feel that more technical matters on how to operate the SCM would had been useful for the readers.
2,Poorly written,"I purchased this book to understand how SAP manages the supply chain, but am pretty disappointed with it. The book apparently was translated from German and is not well written. It feels like the majority of the book is sited from other sources (there are 17 pages of references if this gives you any hint). They will throw five quotes into the same paragraph in some cases. This makes the book very hard to read, it just doesn't flow. Snipits are inserted that really don't fit. It feels like the author's don't really have anything to contibute, they just grabbed other quotes and through a book together. I will probably resell this book and find one that actually makes sense when you read it. Sorry, but I recommend looking elsewhere if you actually want to learn something."
4,Phillips noise cancelling headphone,For the money this headphone is a good value. I use them mainly with noise cancelling off. The 'phone is comfortable and gives good sound quality. I recommend it.
3,Not impressive,Used it for about 3 months now.The audio input jack dosent work now :( .I dont recommend this if you are looking for good noise canceling headphone.
2,"Poor quality, low volume","I bought these from Target for $49.99. What a rip! These may be worth the $17 here but honestly the sound is not clear, and distorted immediately when the volume was up, which was the only way I could hear the high frequencies clearly, and I'm a 20 year old musician. I am returning this product as soon as I can."
3,Good enough!,"When you turn the noise cancelling switch theres a weird,low buzzing sound which occasionally disappears and comes back again. But when you turn noise cancelling off, it functions like an ordinary headset with good sound quality. Anyway for the price, its good enough!"
2,"If you want true noise canceling, look elsewhere","I got these headphones at Christmas 2007, but haven't had a chance to really test out the capabilities until a plane trip I just took to Chicago (2/2008). Now that I've tried them in the true test of airplane ambient noise, I can tell you-don't waste your money on these. When you switch on the noise canceling, all it does is boost the volume a bit - doesn't reduce ambient noise at all. They're fine headphones for certain uses - don't get me wrong. They're fine in quiet environments. But they don't work as advertised. Also, after a few hours of use, I find the ear loops become uncomfortable as they cut into your earlobes somewhat. For passive sound isolation, I recommend the Shure E2c earbuds.2/2/2010 update: I have had the Sennheiser PXC 250 for a while now, and I like them a lot better than the Philips."
4,Philips Noise-canceling,"This product was in extremely good, brand new condition as was posted by the website. I was very happy when I received this product especially since it came well before Amazon's expected date of arrival. The only problem, which really isn't a problem, is that the over ear buds are slightly bulky. But they fit the ear well and produce QUALITY sound. The noise canceling system works like a charm as well. If you are reading this review, you are probably in the market and your search should stop here! Buy it! It is a great item."
4,Decent,"For the price these are pretty good headpones. Turning on the noise reduction switch, just seems to increase the volume. The unique around the head design is fairly comfortable."
3,Good comfortable headphones. Not much noise reduction.,"When activated, noise reduction feels more like amplification, rather than active noise cancelation.However, past the noise reduction, these are some very well made headphones."
4,Good Value Headphones,"Pros:Excellent sound quality, good high and low responseComfortableNoise cancellation works very wellCons:Takes batteriesNoise cancellation strip can be slightly awkward or annoying"
1,no noise cancelling effect,"These headphones have a dececent sound but genuinely no noice cancelling effect. The battery powers the speakers a bit which does make them a littel louder, but nothing special. As you see, the price is down to $22.00 which is probably a good price for these (unfortunatly, I bought them at $50.00 and had to return them)"
1,"""Noise Canceling"" has no effect.","I've tried a few varieties of noise canceling headphones. These have no actual noise reduction that I can determine in any environment. They do tend to amplify the volume a bit, and are clear in terms of sound quality. If it's noise cancellation you're looking for, this model is not for you. I hope I can return them for at least a credit on another model."
1,"Calling these ""Noise Cancelling"" is false advertising!","I honestly can't come up with anything good to say about these headphones. I wasn't expecting much for $25 but I figured they would at least provide some noise cancellation. They don't.Their sound quality is on par with a set of cheap headphones I purchased from a Dollar store. Save yourself some frustration. Skip these, they are junk at half the price."
2,Noise canceling...? Or music amplifying?,"Stylish, comfortable, good sound quality...and utterly useless at noise cancelation. Great for allowing one to conveniently eavesdrop on seat-side passenger conversations while listening to your favorite tunes, and you'll be sure to not miss any important safety instructions on your next flight. Perhaps there's a reason there was no floor demo set out of the box. I suggest you insist on this. Sure, turning on the noise cancelation sliding button would seem to somewhat reduce ambient noise, but as far as I can tell the only thing it does is slightly amplify the music volume."
1,"Makes noice, eats battereis",I replace battary every two weeks. The stupid design with some plastic holders is so uncomfortable. Philips is not a sound company - Must Die!
3,"Noise Reduction is Okay, Comfort Is Bad","The noise reduction features on these is okay. There is a bit of a buzzing sound in the background but it does cancel out a lot of background noise.They are super uncomfortable, however, because of the piece that goes behind the ears. The longer you have these one, the heavier they get, and the more they dig into the back of your ears. I use these for transcription and my ears get pretty sore after a few days of work.They are excellent value for occasional work requiring noise cancellation but I will be upgrading to a more comfy pair."
4,Value for Money,"Well, this isn't for the 'Noise-Canceling' fanatics! But, if you want a good, light headphones with good range and bass for prolonged use: This is your product. For under $10, this is bang for the buck. Awesome sound, has got an airplane addon too which is pretty useless anyway. It is not as if the noise canceling does not work at all. It does but you will not notice the difference as much as you do for other headphones of similar category. Also, do not imagine the earcups to be large so that that enclose your ear! This will probably just be the size of your ear. So, it sits on your ear rather than enveloping it.Plus, there is this long noise-canceling device along the cord, that pretty much reduces the mobility.Like I said, if you want to sit and listen to music for prolonged periods, this is an awesome buy! I would rate the seller Tech REnew a 5/5. USPS service is pretty known!"
3,ok,"The sound is good, but they are not particularly comfortable. When the noise canceling is on, I can only sense a boost in volume and not actual noise canceling. They are still a big step up sound wise from the default iPod speakers and the price was great."
2,Headphones for working out,I purchased/returned this headset to use during work-outs but I didn't like the obtrusive long plastic part that was attached a noise cancellation object.
2,"Not thrilling, but okay.","Pros:- Around the head design prevents ""headphone hair"".- Okay for casual listening where volume levels are low.Cons:- Sound is below par, equivalent to cheapie headphones. Distortion at moderate bass and volume levels.- Noise canceling is mostly non-existent. It drowns out about 50% of the hum of a loud computer fan. Doesn't noise-cancel anything else.- The noise canceling ""stick"" is huge. It measures 5""x0.75"" (LxW).- The ear hooks start to irritate after prolonged use.Comments: If you're looking for quality sound and noise canceling, move along, these headphones aren't for you. They're okay for casual, at the office-type, low-volume, without the worry of headphone hair listening."
2,Glad I didn't pay for these.,"I just happened upon a pair of these that someone was giving away. I now understand why: There is no discernible noise canceling effect whatsoever. I tried them with and without music. Just a low hum when you turn the switch on. Oh, and the music gets louder.Sound quality is pretty decent. Comfort is okay."
1,Uncomfortable behind-the-head design.,"The main problem with these headphones is in the rigid connector that is supposed to lie behind your head. Maybe this would be okay if you're walking around, but if you're trying to use them sitting back against a couch, airplane head rest, or in bed, the headphones get in the way and the pressure on the strap causes the earpieces themselves to lose their seal on the ear. As others have mentioned these are really just amplifying headphones which boost the volume and create an underlying buzz to drown out constant background noise. This has been useful on noisy bus rides. But they require batteries and I found it too easy to accidentally leave the amplifier on and then the batteries down quickly."
5,Satisfying Headphones,"Since I'm not an audiophile like most people who buy noise cancelling headphones, I consider this product a great purchase. It is not expensive, has noise cancelling, and has superb sound quality. The sound quality on these are better than those found in the Sony Behind the Neck Sport Headphones. The ""hiss"" others have complained about I can not find. The noise cancelling is not noise isolating. You will hear loud noises. The low buzzy and medium ranges will not be heard.Buy these if you want noise cancelling in behind the neck headphones but not BOSE headphones."
3,"Comfortable, good quality sound, but the noise-canceling didn't work well","You can't get good noise-canceling for less than several hundred dollars. Get that expectation clear in your mind. All the button did when flipped was raise the volume slightly, and didn't help drown out my neighbor's music in the slightest.But as headphones, these are stylish, comfortable and had good quality sound."
3,"Good product, but disposable only","Technically, the headphones are a great buy. Economically, I would stay away. I own a pair, and if you listen to a lot of music, the ear pads on these headphone (like any other soft foam pads) will corrode due to the acids in your skin. This is a common problem, and typically, not considered a problem, as you would just replace the pads. Philips does not, however, sell the replacement pads, nor do they make replacement pads at all for these headphones.So, if money is a concern, don't expect these to last."
4,Great for the price,"I've had these headphones for several years and they're still holding up. The noise cancelling/volume control is clunky and needs a AAA battery. The headphones themselves are relatively small compared to some of the more expensive brand's models, so they aren't too bad for traveling. The cushions around the ears help to block out more noise than typical ear buds, and when the noise reduction is on, it works pretty well. I've been able to muffle my boyfriends loud, exploding, guns-firing video games. It wont get rid of outside noise completely, but it will muffle it! I think they're comfortable, but after a couple hours of wear, the ear clips start to get irritating. The sound quality seems good to me, but I'm no expert. They sound a little richer and deeper with the noise reduction turned on. I shopped around before I bought them, and it seemed to me that there aren't a lot of noise cancelling headphones in this price range. I think they're a good deal for the price."
2,Terrible humming noise,"I bought a set from Target, and took them back for a refund the same day. When the noise canceling feature is turned on, there is an annoying humming noise in which you have to turn up the volume just to overcome.I just broke down and bought a pair of Sony's instead."
1,Awful Awful Waste of my money,"The purpose of buying these headphones was to use them particularly on long-haul flights. However, when you put these headphones on and try to put your head back, the phones push themselves off your ears. No Good. I had to sit upright to listen to these properly. Sound quality didnt rock my world. And the big AA Battery department is ugly. I can't believe this product got signed off as being worthy of sale. What a shame."
1,"It's true, it really is false advertising!","My dad bought me these headphones while I was shopping at a local store, but little did I know, that was a mistake. You have to turn on the noise-canceling slider switch just to hear some good quality music; if you don't turn on the switch, the audio is very low and the music quality sounds bad. I payed $50 for this and it's the last purchase I make before doing my research. I searched for these on Amazon.com to see if others were having the same problems, so now I know. DO NOT BUY THESE! EVER!!!!I'm so disappointed in this product that I'm giving it ZERO STARS!Note: Amazon made me put that one star to post this review.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!"
1,dont get these,I was really annoyed when I received this item and returned it right away. There are so many good headphones on the market... don't waste your time on these. They are crappy.
4,Lead Content,"For those of you who are concerned with the FDA's 2008 study regarding lead in Rainbow Light vitamins*, let's just try to keep in mind that this is the same FDA that allows drinking water (including bottled) to have up to 15mcg of lead in it. Makes this study seem a little trivial, doesn't it?Do what I did and install a lead-removing water filter, and keep taking your high-quality, easily-absorbed Rainbow Light Prenatals (try their Prenatal One or minis if you hate swallowing pills) and you and your babies will be much better off![...]"
3,"Tricky wording - ""Food Based"" not 100% whole food!","I took Mega Food Baby & Me while pregnant but switched to these while nursing. I don't like these as much and I'm thinking of switching back to Baby & Me for my next pregnancy. These also are very hard to swallow and I do not have a hard time (usually) swallowing pills. I would swallow 2 baby & me pills at the same time - they were the same size just smoother!Also yes beware of the tricky wording ""Food Based"". I know Baby & Me are 100% Whole foods and use cold fusion. A lot of vitamins are 'food based'. I just wish the Mega Food Baby & Me were a little less expensive but it may be worth it! I don't think I will be buying Rainbow Light again even though I did notice they now have a MINI pill."
5,Awesome Vitamins,"I like these vitamins a lot, they're a lot better than any of the other synthetic brands on the market. I was encouraged by a friend to try food based prenatals and these are what she recommended. I have more energy and feel confident that I'm doing something good for me and my baby. I take so many pills that taking six of these a day isn't bad for me.I honestly don't know what some reviewers are talking about when it comes to th size and texture of the pills. I had no issues swallowing them, they don't smell bad, and I didn't find them to be rough with any sharp edges. Granted, I don't have any issues with taking pills but these are smaller than my regular multivitamin and I find that they go down just fine with water. I think it's worth it to find whatever method works best for you, because these vitamins are great!"
3,Good for someone who has a stong stomach,This item advertises that it is gentle on the stomach. Not for me though. I am 5 months prenant and each time I take these I get indigestion that will not go away. All the ingredients are great. It is the perfect combination for what a prego mom needs. But it just doesn't work if one can not take them. Go figure.
2,I don't like it at all.,The tablets are huge and smell bad. I feel really painful to swallow six tablets per day. I just take it for a week and switch to other brands recommended by my doctor.
1,I hate these vitamins,"Maybe I didn't read correctly, but I sure didn't see that one dose of these vitamins was more than one pill! what I thought would be a 60-day supply ended up being less than a month. I think there are a lot better prenatal vitamins on the market that are a better value. Plus, they look disgusting, like compressed grass clippings."
3,You have to take SIX!,"While I am very pleased with the ingredients, I did not realize that a daily dose involves swallow SIX of these horse pills. I will finish this bottle, but I have a hard time getting down more than three per day."
3,"Okay, but not really food based and contain lead","I took these while breastfeeding my daughter. I thought they were pretty good at the time, I never had any problems with this vitamin. I hear from a lot of people who really like these. However, I don't like that they claim to be ""food-based"". Yes, they have food in them, but the vitamins themselves are just the same as what you'd find in a normal multivitamin. Other food-based vitamins, like New Chapter and Mega Foods, are different. The vitamins themselves are from cultured food which is supposedly more easily absorbed. The only other possible issue is the lead levels in this vitamin. It contains more lead than many other multivitamins. These levels are still considered safe, but it is something to consider (source: http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/pbvitami.html)"
3,Will look for another,"My body reacted very well to this protect. My bathroom routine was the most normal ever. My skin was wonderful. My pms was calmer. I didn't feel sick from taking the pills.The pills are huge and they smell funny. It makes me want to puke but I hold my nose or I take it with orange juice. Something strong to mask the smell and taste.After I finish the bottle, I will be researching again for another product."
4,Great prenatal vitamin,"I absolutely love these prenatal vitamins. I love the fact that it is food based. I have had no stomach problems taking this pill. I can take it on an empty stomach and I feel fine. The only cons and the reason I only gave the pills 4 stars is the fact that the suggested usage is 6 pills a day. That's a lot of pill taking and I sometimes forget. The pills are large. If you have problems swallowing pills, you may not like these. I have gotten used to them and just take them with plenty of water. I think the fact that the pills are all natural make up for the size. I highly recommend these pills."
3,"big smelly pills, 6x/day","When I first started taking the Rainbow Light supplements, it was before I got pregnant, and I was able to handle the pills without a problem. By the 6th week of pregnancy, though, I was starting to deal with nausea, and every time I took these pills, it would trigger a gag reflex, making me throw up even more often than I already was.Since you have to take these 6 times/day, that was just too much for my weak stomach, so I found a small B-complex vitamin that I could handle, and started eating Belly Bars (a nutrition bar that has prenatal vitamins in it).These pills are fine, if you can handle taking large pills several times a day. I'll probably resume taking them later, but for now, I'll get my vitamins other ways."
3,Not a huge fan,"I wanted a vitamin that I would only have to take one a day, this isn't it. They are horrible tasting and got caught in my throat often. I'm sure they work just fine but I didn't take them long enough to find out."
3,"6 Tablets Daily, That's too much!",The vitamins would have been great if you only had to take one but 6 is way too much it's not easy to swallow more than one.
5,Best prenatal vitamin I have ever used,"This is by far the best prenatal vitamin I have ever used. We are expecting our 4th child so I have tried quite a few other brands. I bought these at the recommendation of my midwife, I was having a hard time finding a good prenatal that wasn't low in B6 (I find I get depressed if I don't get enough B vitamins). These were much easier to digest than anything else I have used, also they have the iron a pregnant woman needs but its not constipating like all the other prenatals I have used. I like the Rainbow Light vitamins so much that I switched the whole family over to this brand. We buy the Rainbow Light Multistars for the kids and my husband takes the mens one a day. I really like that these vitamins contain proboitics as well. We are saving lots of money by taking these vitamins over the multiple supplements we had been taking to provide the same nutrients. Thanks Rainbow Light!"
4,6 Tablets a day!,"Before you buy, make sure you realize that with the ""complete prenatal system"" you are supposed to take 6 tablets a day, in order to get all the RDA of the vitamins and stuff. I didn't realize that when I ordered, and I probably won't order again for that reason (I'm going to go with the Rainbow Light Just Once prenatal). BUT, if you are okay with taking that many vitamins a day, and it isn't a nuisance, this system is great, and I believe it helped the swelling in my feet and toes too. They didn't bother my stomach at all, or give me heartburn. Expensive, but a really great brand that can be trusted."
2,Not ideal for sensitive stomachs,"I bought this prenatal because I love that it is a whole-food vitamin. I don't even mind that you have to take 6 pills a day. What I do mind is that it exacerbates my pre-existing digestive issues.I stopped taking the Raibow Light vitamins and have since switched to New Chapter Organics. Their prenatal contains probiotics (like acidophilus) that help digestion rather than cause it to act up. I have had no issues since the switch. If you have a sensitive stomach (think IBS), you may want to consider New Chapter Organics."
5,I won't use anything else!,"This is my first time reviewing, and I chose to do it to put in another positive voice about this vitamin to help encourage anyone who is considering trying them to do so.I've tried a few brands of prenatal vitamin and the effects were not great. They made me feel uneasy or nauseated. One more expensive brand I picked up claimed it was easy on the stomach but was so volatile that even cutting the pill and taking an almost miniscule dose caused me to be physically sick.The Rainbow Light prenatal vitamins were so easy on my system that not only was I never sick from them, but I even felt healthier. After four nights of sicking up on other brands once I had been using when my Rainbow Light vitamins were used up, I immediately ordered my second bottle and will never use another brand again or suggest any other brand to a friend."
4,Rare find - entertaining set,"I came across this listing while searching for a ""Hollywood's Mysteries and Scandals"" (a long-cancelled show""). This vhs set is dated in the early 1990's, so don't expect any updated information. This is a quick run-through of some of Hollywood's tragic and weird tales of the ""stars"", some well-known and some not so. The narrative is clear and concise with no unnessary dramatazations. Some of the clips and photos would not be shown on any current documentaries, so this makes this a very rare find. For a used VHS set, the cost was reasonable."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"When I first ordered this CD, I didn't realize it was ""enhanced with music"". Usually that ruins it, but I was very surprised to find that the flutes are so subtle, they really do enhance the sound of the winds, rather than ruin or dominate the sound. For the price I paid, this was a great bargain and I really recommend it for using to sleep, relax, work, write, or meditate."
5,KJV Cornerstone Compact Snap Flap Bible,"This Compact Bible is the perfect size to carry with you anywhere! Many of my friends have requested one after seeing mine. I use it at home, at Church, on the go... I love it!"
3,soft,"I loved this bracelet when it arrived and consequently wore it all the time. However, within a month it had a huge dent in it. I'm sure I hit it against something, but I'm not that hard on my jewelry, and aside from the occasional ""weak link"" have never damaged anything. I wear bracelets almost constantly so I'm used to working around them. This bracelet sits in my jewelry box but every time I go to wear it I decide not to because the dent is so noticeable. The description did say that the bracelet is hollow, I just didn't expect it to be so fragile. The bracelet really is beautiful otherwise, but I paid more for it than I usually do for silver jewelry (I had a gift card) and I expected it to be better quality."
5,The best Nightmare sequel in book form,"This was a great book. I am one of the lucky ones and I have a rare hard-back copy of it. It starts out in Kristins dream when she is walking up to Freddy's house. If you can find a copy of this rare book don't hesitate to buy it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."
5,excellent resource,"A very easy to follow resource for the methylation cycle as it related to B vitamin metabolism needed for good health, irregardless of diagnosis. Those with genetic mutations that affect B vitamin metabolism such as MTHFR or MTRR or MTR will find it especially helpful.Great for anyone who are using genetics to help fight disease, especially physicians and family of those suffering from issues related to B vitamin issues resulting in elevated HCY. Having homocysteine (HCY) in acceptable range is the first step for better cardiac, neurologic, and general health."
2,Massage tool,"I wasn't very impressed with this product, not because it isn't well made, but because it just doesn't work for me. I'll probably just end up using the balls to practice my golf shots with."
5,Perfect,Did exactly what it says it does. NO more protein film and I'm enjoying my reef again! Will buy Seachems products again!
4,great find,"i use this in combo with seachem purigen, and matrix carbon, and my water is always top quality crystal clear. i can literally see just as clear thru 5 feet of tank water, as i would looking directly at the wall behind it, and get comments on it all the time."
1,YUCK!!!!,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM THINKING I WAS GOING TO GET A DELICIOUS SMELLING LOTION THAT SPREAD ON YOUR SKIN LIKE WHIP CREAM INSTEAD I RECIEVED AN STINKING SMELLING IMATATION FRUIT IT SMELLS HORRIBLE YOU WILL BE SOOOOO DISSAPOINTED IF YOU GET THIS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY
5,Great Price for greta Games,"When i originally bought Star Trek Armada and Star Trek Voyager I payed [$$]each for them. i was surprised to see the price dropped so quickly for a aweosme bundle like this.STVoayer may get boring after a while but the exp pack adds a few new thing and the holomatch is never boring.Star trek Aramda is not boring. it is never the same new missions, new places to build etc.Star Trek Armada 2 is very confusing to me and hard to manueveIf just want ST VOyager Elite force+ exp pack and Armada get this. it's a great deal!"
3,Does this even work under Windows 7?,"Have Star Trek Armada 1 & 2 (purchased separately) can't speak for the other games.Star Trek Armada 1 is a 2D top down perspective spaceship combat game in the Star Trek Universe - thoroughly enjoyed it on Windows XP. Star Trek Armada 2 tried to introduce ""3D"" graphics with (my opinion) disastrous effect, final result was no where's near as fun as Star Trek Armada 1.Has anyone been able to get this to run under Windows 7? Noticed it's not listed under the operating systems."
3,i'm confused...,"i was charmed at first to discover a video that my 17 month old is interested in, besides sesame street and the baby einstein series. however each episode contains a literally scary section whereby a character callled ""shadow"" is introduced and tells a pretty absurd mini-story, eery even by adult standards... i was very much puzzled... was this well intended on the grounds that somehow, small doses of scary do good to children??? i would love to hear the explanation of the makers of this series. for now tough, i have put away the dvd because i don't want my baby to have nightmares..."
4,Bear beats them all,Bear is orginal. My children love to dance and sing along with the dvd. Its a perfact gift for toddlers.
5,Kids love it!!,"This is a really good movie. It teaches kids great values ( don't lie, follow your dreams, work hard...). My kids watch it almost everyday. My husband and I also enjoyed the movie."
5,Excellent DIsney Channel show!,"This DVD is based on The Disney Channel Show. Video, audio effects are excellent, as are the performers, many who are fans of preteen and teen children. My granddaughter, age 13, loves this show and DVD. I also bought the CD for portability. I recommend this for all fans of this Disney show. As usual, Disney is eternally A-1!"
1,Just plain awful,"A real disappointment. Terrible, and I mean, TERRIBLE, audio and video. I got my money back. Stan Kenton deserves far better."
1,Amateur Garbage Wrestling at it's most pathetic,"Wow I wish I liked this DVD, I really do. I'm a big ECW/FMW fan, and was expecting (perhaps wishing a bit much, but still...) to at least get an entertaining hardcore wrestling experience, but to my disappointment I got a disc full of amateurs doing stupid stunts with little to no skill, regard for themselves, or their opponents. Sure, hardcore wrestling is supposed to be crazy, but this is just plain sloppy. The only entertaining moments were from the VERY latino announcer ""Larry"" and the brief shoots by Chris Candido and Shane Douglas, the latter of which was the only moment where you could actually tell the audience was enjoying the show. Quite frankly just skip over this DVD on your way to the ECW DVDs, because, just like I am right now, you'll be kicking yourself later for having wasted money on such garbage."
2,Who are they kidding?,"This has got to be the worst attempt at a deathmatch tournament in wrestling history. I spent the 25 bucks to see what xpw was all about and to be completely honest, don't waste your money. Former ECW stars John Kronus, Chris Candido, Shane Douglas, and Axl Rotten all make a presence felt, but that is not worth the 25 bucks. Supreme granted is a big man and took some pretty sick bumps is no Mick Foley. The Xpw's version of Ric Blade(czw/japw) comes off as a more guts than brains high flyer. The world title match between the real deal damien steele and Chris Candido is nothing special. People don't waste your money, buy ECW's Hardcore History, or Path of Destruction and you won't be dissapointed."
3,XPW Baptized In Blood,"XPW is along the same lines of ECW. This particular event is very extreme and is not wrestling at all. All matches are from the February 26, 2000 Baptized In Blood card.Kid Kaos, Supreme, Johnny Webb, Messiah, Kronus, Carlito Montana, Axl Rotten and Homeless Jimmy compete in an 8 man tournament to crown the first ever XPW King Of The Death Champion. There's Barbed Wire, Nails, Thumbtacks, Broken Glass, Light Bulbs and more.JN vs. Chronic.Damien Steele vs. Chris Candido for the XPW Title.2 Bonus Matches.....4-15-00. And Then There Were Four. Johnny Webb vs. Messiah in a Cage Match.7-20-02. Night Of Champions. Webb vs. Shane Douglas in a Loser Leaves XPW Match for the XPW Title."
3,May be worth it too some people,This tape is full of hardcore gimmick matches in a death match tournament. But be warned this tape is a indy tape so dont expect too much out of it because these guys are rookies and make alot of mistakes and dont sell the action very well. (ex. when john kronus tries too cut Supreme with a piece of glass you can see supreme take a razor blade and knick himself with it too bleed while his hand is in front of the glass.) But the tape does show some wrestlers taking some hard bumps (wrestling lingo for hard falls and hits) so in conclusion this tape is worth the price if your a fan of indy wrestling or must see every hardcore match in the world.
3,"Great card but not enough violence too be ""hardcore""","I bought this tape a couple of months ago. I am a big fan of ECW, CZW and BJW. I thougt that this card was good but it was not hardcore enough to be called King of the Deathmatch. I have seen many a King of Deathmatches and personally my favorite was the IWA KOTDM 1995 second was the IWA midsouth this is an American league that is truly hardcore. Third is the Bjw Deathmatch tournament it was great but the matches were not set up very well for example the first round was too brutal and more like a semifinal than a first round. And last the XPW Deathmatch tournament. The card is great but the tournament has too many lowblows and not enough barbed wire! The finals should have been something like a fire deathmatch."
5,Caswell-Massey Sandalwood soap,I just love the smell of sandalwood. This soap definitely has the aroma. I've tried others but they were so weak in aroma. Gentle on the skin and really lathers up. This is the only sandalwood soap I'll buy from now on.
5,What a great smell!!,"If you have never smelled Sandalwood before you have to try this soap.Not only is it great to shower with, but I keep a bar in my towel closet too. Keeps them smelling great!Once again, much cheaper on here than on the CM site!"
5,Wainwright's Best Yet?,"John Wainwright, ex-Yorkshire cop, has written over 70 tremendously varied crime novels. This one attempts to portray all the facets of police work in a 24-hour period, from multiple viewpoints: street cops, ranking police officers, victims, crooks, and families of all. There are over thirty ""main"" characters, but they are so sharply individualized that one always knows who's who at any time. There are several plot strands, carefully distributed, and a catastrophic, very satisfying climax. Wainwright brings all his characters alive with no wasted words. This book has it all: complex and varied characters, logical and interesting plot, excellent pacing, well-portrayed Yorkshire village life, humor, and wisdom. A fine novel!"
4,Bicycle Pedals,I purchased these pedals at the time I purchased a Schwinn Airdyne bicycle and glad I did so. The pedals that came with the Airdyne were small and very narrow. These pedals being wider and having an adjustable strap were a huge improvement. They are however a bit difficult to adjust.I would still recommend these pedals as replacements to anyone.
1,Not worth the money,"Even if you have exhausted all your yaoi resources, I don't think this is worth picking up. The artwork seems very amateur-ish and inconsistent. The first story made no sense at all, the second story...actually wasn't too bad (even had a plot). The third story actually made me feel a little sick.Don't bother."
2,Disappointed,"But my preference is for the written word rather than picture books.This could make a great story, if written well."
1,It fell apart the first time I tried to use it.,This must be the worst ice cream scoop I have ever seen. It actually fell apart - one of the parts fell off - before I could ever finish scooping the first scoop. I would advise that you do not waste your time with this one.
5,great LITTLE compressor,"Great Little Compressor. If you haven't seen one of these I can't stress how small and light these things are.I'm a general contractor and let all the guys use this towards the end of the project when I don't want them hauling a 40lb compressor through the finished house. works great with the micro pinner and will run a Senco finish nailer no problem. Don't use it for production with a 16g gun but it is fine for pick up, or that casing that you forgot to nail off properly.The micro pinner is a gem, you barely know there is a fastener, one coat of finish either paint or a clear finsh and they fill in.The painters love them because they are so easy and FAST to fill or just paint over.This isn't the first nail gun or compressor you should buy, unless you ar a hobbyist doing craft work, but it is a very nice tool."
1,Senco PC90974 Finish Pro 10 Micro Pinner and Compressor,"while the kit is comprehensive and the compressor works well, the micro Pinner is junk. This is the second Senco mirco pinner that I have purchased and the second to fail. This gun refuses to set 3/4"" pins at all. It leaves the heads sticking out on every shot. My first senco lasted about 2 months before it jambed and refused to work. I purchased a Fastco micro pinner 3 years ago for twice the price but I've never had a problem. It seems product quality for senco has taken a back seat to economy and unreliablity( As there fiasco with the AIR FREE 40 cordless nailers proves.) I am a licensed Contractor who only does finish work. My tools must be the best and this product is not."
4,Pretty good!,"It is a good book. I really like the auther and have some of his other books. It is good but kind of puts down some peoples beliefs about hypnosis and could ruin the fun. But remember it never says hypnosis in general isn't real. It also has some encouraging things. I mean by this, it proves wrong what made some people scared of hypnosis."
1,No review as Stuff did not arrive on time!,"This is not a review of your product as it has only just arrived along with the rest of my order!! I was assured that the order had been dispatched on 10th december and was very disappointed when it did not show up until Thursday 3rd of january!! It apparently came via Germany, is this usual? Maybe you could give me an explanation why there was a delay and friends had to go without Christmas presents!!"
2,Good until it breaks or wears out,The sharpener is made from a split plastic mold. Mine split when I put pressure on it from extended use. I epoxied back together but I think the ceramic insert lost it's availability to sharpen.I've switched back to the old fashioned way using a whetstone.
4,A good sharpener,This is a handly sharpener for all knives and is one of the best non electric ones. It is easy to hold and does a good job on all the knives I have tried on it. Even for a quick touch-up it works well. Great for the price.
4,Good for maintenance,"This sharpener seems to be doing a decent job of keeping my knives in shape. I don't get the impression that it would be the right tool for a major sharpness restoration job, but if you use it regularly it does pretty well."
4,GOOD SHARPENER,THIS IS A GOOD SHARPENER FOR A MANUAL TYPE. HOWEVER IT WILL NOT SHARPEN A VERY DULL KNIFEIT WAS SHIPPED PROMPTLY FOR A FAIR PRICE
4,I was moved to tears...,"Few books move me in the way this did! Being a dog lover/enthusiast, I was again reminded how incredible our canine companions truly are. Courage, strength, willpower and sheer determination against all odds. How privileged we are to have them. Congratulations Hilary on a moving and inspiring tribute to our beloved dogs."
5,The Wreck of the Ethie,"My nine-year-old daughter and I took turns reading this book aloud to each other at bedtime. I became so caught up in the story that I started reading ahead each night after she was asleep -- I couldn't wait until the next day to see what happened! We both loved the characters, especially the brave dog, Skipper. And it was heartwarming to read a story that contains so many people performing brave deeds in a desperate situation. My daughter enjoyed the book so much that she asked me to buy a copy for her class at school so that her friends can read it as well."
5,The Best Book I Ever Read,"The Wreck of the Ethie is a super book. The author uses lots of action words to make it a good adventure book. It is about a fishing family that has a Newfoundland dog, Skipper,who tries to help 92 people aboard the Steamship Ethie that was in one of the worst winter gales in Newfoundland's history. I think that the book is the best book I ever read. I think if you like ships and historical fiction this book is a must read."
5,Great Read for Children and Adults Alike!,"Hilary Hyland has done a commendable job writing this historical fiction book that children and adults will LOVE! It is a fictionalized account of the Ethie, a coastal steamer holding 92 passengers and crew that was caught in a terrifying storm off the coast of Newfoundland. The dramatic account is told from the viewpoint of a young girl on shore and the ship's boy. The heart of the book is a Newfoundland dog, who plays a crucial role in the rescue of the people aboard the doomed ship. You will be on the edge of your seat throughout this exciting book. An Author's Note and glossary of nautical terms at he end of the book are great additions for children!Mrs. Hyland also visits schools to talk about her book and the research involved. She comes accompanied by her own Newfoundland Dog, Cubbie. Hyland and Cubbie were a huge hit with the students and staff!"
2,Lots of Paper - No Meat or Vegetables,"The book seems to be written by a bunch of programmer who wrote some explanation around some of their already existing code.Problem is that the book is so poorly indexed, that even though it covers examples in many subjects, unless you are willing to thumb through the entire book each time you need to look something up ... you won't find it.Examples include: parameterized queries, combo boxes and even tool tips. Items such as these are covered, but not indexed, making the book almost useless as a reference guide. The book seems to cover a few high level subjects, without discussing much of the necessary foundation ground work of C#/Microsoft programming."
4,Wrox does it again - A+,"I was a technical reviewer on this title and find it to be one of the books I keep going back to. It has a good spectrum of coverage and is really for those applying C# and .Net to a real world situation. It is not going to teach you syntax for C# but will show you how to use the .Net framework for Data intensive apps using technologies such as XML, Active Directory, How to migrate existing apps over to .Net to mention a few topics."
1,Disappointing,"Of all the DVD concerts that I have watched, this one by DEVO has the worst sound quality I've heard to date.If you're a hard core DEVO fan then perhaps you may wish to purchase this DVD for the interviews. If you're a music lover looking to add something from DEVO to your DVD collection go with the DVD concert from the Lollapalooza tour (DEVO Live). The two concerts are very similar but the Lollapalooza concert has better sound quality."
2,"Could have been better, a lot better.","The biggest problem with this disc is that it has the same set list as the '96 Lollapalooza tour. Hey Spuds, relearn all your songs and change your set lists! Then put that on a dvd."
3,It just sits in the toy box.,My son got this for christmas when he was 13 months old. We bought it because in the store it kept him entertained while I was shopping. Now at home he hardly every plays with it and never really has played with it very much even when he first got it.
5,Fun on a stick!,"I bought this toy for my son's first Christmas - he was 9 months old at the time. I figured it would be good for a bang or two, but I was so wrong. He loves this toy! At first it was a little heavy for him, but now that he's almost one year old he loves to pick up the stick from either end and bop the side of his playpen, the floor, the furniture and, yes, even the dog. We all get a kick out of the sounds, and he is very proud of himself for being able to make such interesting noises. Best of all (besides the fun and durability factors), this toy is one of the few noise-makers that isn't too loud and the sounds are hilarious."
4,Great toy!,My son is developmentally delayed and this toy is perfect for him. He got it for his 3rd birthday and at first it was a little bit too heavy for him to pick it up and he was accidentally hitting himself in the head with it. But now he loves to play with it. He just bangs and bangs on his high chair. It is a good cause and effect toy.
4,A Sound Gift!,"I bought this for my nephew's first birthday and he has really played with it alot! It's a great value for those shopping on a budget too. He loves the sounds he gets by bumping in on the floor, couch, our heads, his head, his tummy.... Only drawback is that the on/off switch is located right on the handle where children are meant to grip the toy, as a result, he often turns it off without meaning to--and then wonders where the sounds are! Educational? Well, it makes him belly laugh out loud and that's a good thing to learn! Overall a good toy."
3,"Good toy for a friend's child, but not your own!","A stick that gives a child an incentive -- fun noises -- to whack something with it is just a bad idea for your own child. However, if you have a sibling who gave YOUR child a drum set, this toy is the perfect revenge. Seriously, my nephew loved it -- his mother hated it. The noises are really fun -- not your usual ""robo-sounds"" you get from most electronic toys."
2,Cute but Not Much Entertainment,"A friend bought this for my son's first Christmas. He was ten months old and would smile when I shook it to make the noise. Now, at eighteen months, he will hold it for a minute or two if I pass the stick to him, but he quickly loses interest in it.I keep it at my desk at work, though. It makes a great stress reliever!"
4,My child loves it,"This is a very fun toy - I purchased it for my son's first birthday in May, but just couldn't wait, and added it to his Easter basket. He grins every time he sees it, and loves to drag it while he crawls to make funny sounds. It's larger than I expected, but still somewhat manageable. Probably not appropriate for a younger infant, but a really great gift!"
3,Could be better,"David Bryan is a really good keyboard player, but the video is not very explicative. I think the most useful part is where he told a few, but very important tips he uses on his songs, about pentatonic skills, how to play along with the band, follwing the guitar or the drums, a little bit about rythm on the left hand, but he does not really go deep in the explaniation and the technique. The cameras miss a bit on the hands action. It could be very useful for beginers whit some base on playing the keybord."
3,"Lackey clone, anyone?","The first half of this book seemed to be a combination of Mercedes Lackey's Arrows of the Queen, and Tamora Pierce's Alanna. I mean please: wake up one morning with an irresistable urge to find divine white horses and disguise yourself as a boy while doing so thereby proving that you're stronger, more magical, better rider, etc. etc. etc. than all the boys.Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, while I was reading it. It was fairly well written and moved along quickly, but I was left with a feeling of incompleteness. What is the Dance and what does it do? What do the riders do when they are not Dancing? Why and how did so many die in the end? If the stallions are gods, why did they need her to control them?Who on earth would decide that having horses as gods was a good idea?"
2,Two and a half stars. Maybe I should have put three.,"I enjoyed reading this book, but in my opinion it should have an editor with a fine tooth comb over most of it. The plot was entertaining, I loved the sense of honor and the courage that Valeria posessed, since I also love horses the book was almost a perfect read.Though I must comment on the writing style, many times the paragraphs were choppy, did not flow well, and there were more malapropisms than I care for.Not an intellectual book, but it's not meant to be, and I strongly suggest that if you have the time, read it."
2,A formula romance novel in fantasy clothes,"This book started out enjoyably with an interesting concept of ""horse gods"" and humans who were ""called"" to be their riders. It would have continued to be involving, but for slipping into romance novel formula, with the heroine, Valeria, falling into bed with one or the other men -- Euan the barbarian prince or Kerrec, the senior rider, far too often and easily for my taste. The other characters began to be far more interesting than the primary heroine. I have read other works by Judith Tarr and enjoyed them. Luna appears to be an imprint of Harlequin Books and it shows."
2,Disappointed,"When I ordered this book I was hoping for a good plot, a good romance and great characters, but I was disappointed by the heroine of the book. She was not likeable and I hated her relationship with Euan. The plot was o.k. but not memorable and the romance was bad, mainly because 80% was about two characters I hated together and even with Kerrec and Valeria I felt that they did not love each other. I found myself getting bored with the book and disliking the characters much. If you don't mind disliking the main character and poor relationships then this book isn't that bad."
1,The Mountain's Call,"This book started out well but by page 200 I just wanted to strangle Valeria. She's sets off on her own against her mother's wishes. On the journey to the mountain, she's portrayed as a strong person and we're told about her loyatly to the country. On the journey and after she arrives at the mountain she's given reason to dislike/fear men and professes to hate them all. Yet she hops right into bed with both men who pay any attention to her, one of whom is a prisoner and ""Barbarian Prince"". Betray her? No problem give her a kiss. He ""loves her"", he's ""just using her"" no wait he ""loves her"" no wait... I'm pretty good at suspending disbelief but this book had so many glaring inconsistencies that I just couldn't stand it."
5,The High School Handbook,"It was in very good condition and I appreciated the quick shipping also! Very good transaction, thank you!!"
5,Graduating Soon,"I will be graduating in June and I feel it's always better to be prepared and this book should help me immensely. If they call me back, I'm prepared."
4,fearless interviewing,"Fearless Interviewing: How to Win the Job by Communicating with Confidencevery informative book, i really like the sample interview questions it has w/ the area to answer to help prepare."
5,Best interviewing book ever,"Prior to reading, doing the exercises in this book, I had countless interviews that went nowhere. After I used this book, I was the interviewee master guru and talked myself into many job offers. So it works, its not a gimmik, just a tool to help focus ones thoughts, narrow your skills, and maximize your communication.The book states that 90% of interviews claim the reason they did not hire an interviewee is because they could NOT ARTICULATE their skills in the interview. I would not have thought that about myself, but once I read the book, narrowed and foucused my skills, and practiced (taped myself) I realized what the author was talking about. It is an inexpensive book and worth it! Dont buy a used copy, as there are exercises to do and you will want a blank slate. Buy more than one copy to keep and share with others, I have referred or given this book to many!"
2,"Nice orchestrations, but otherwise a truly amateur effort","I got this CD at a garage sale for free. It's quite easy to understand why the owner was getting rid of it. The playing is nice and catchy, but the vocals on this recording are incredibly sophomoric. The CD is a collection of Jazz and Standards, and the vocals on two cuts are especially terrible. On ""You've Changed"" and ""In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning,"" Mr. Pickwood's voice wavers and cracks, and turns what should be beautiful, tender songs into true aural horror. It sounds like an American Idol reject scraped up some cash and decided to record his own album, which is probably what happened, I guess, as the CD lists ""Pickwood Music"" as the contact. My advice to Mr. Pickwood would be, don't give up your day job."
5,Enjoy Alan immensely!,"While I won't pick apart the previous reviewer's remarks one by one, I can say that I have read Mr. Franklin, seen him speak live, and both times found him to be well researched. In addition, ALL of the material he presented was Biblically documented!! I would recommend him highly, as an author and a speaker!"
2,Great but need to be more durable.,I do love these containers. I have about 3 dozen of these. The only complaint that I have is that this 2.5qt size does get cracked on the bottom from the massive pressure of the suction. After about 4 or five reseals I start to notice that it loses it seal. When I inspect the canister I notice that the ones in this size have cracks on the bottom and will no longer form an airtight seal. I hope they improve on this flaw.
1,These sure don't work as well as the other food saver items I have bought,"Used these once (2) Some time after I bought them maybe 3 Months, I filled with nuts sealed them, put them in the cabinet 1 Month later go to get the nuts for a meal the lids on both fell right off.WHAT! Huh? After examination both canisters fractured at their base the canisters leaked and the nuts rotted.The bags and the smaller canisters have worked well.Someday I'll try crazy glue or something to see if they can be fixed.I'd stay away form them.Updated 2012 their marinated units I purchased two. Cracks leak like a sieve they have only been hand washed and treated like a dozen eggs. Pieces of keyrap the canisters and the marinators . They should stick to the plastic bags and you should too"
1,Innaccurate and haughty style,"Who is this guy Margulis? He ought to be writing self-defense books! This is a ""low-conscience"" offering that disregards the ecosystem, uses other undocumented sources, and is pretty hard to use in the field. I can't recommentd anything about it."
5,best jack ever,I had ordered this jack as i was going to rent one but it was 15.00 dollars a day and i was jacking up a sagging floor which was going to take at least two weeks..this jack did the trick at 40 bucks and i own the jack.. I really do believe this jack could of lifted my house if i wanted..
4,Great for the money,"This is a very good jack considering how cheap it is. I have the 20 ton model and used it to raise the center beam in my house which was sinking. I gave it 4 stars because the handle used to raise and lower the jack seems to be weak--not a big deal. Overall, this jack is well worth the money."
3,Product appears to be 50% reliable,"I purchased 4 of these jacks to lift a sagging floor in my home. 2 of the jacks worked flawlessly, while the other 2 jacks appeared to compress if you left any weight on them over a period of time. I got around this buy using the jacks, but then putting in temporary supports. I wouldn't trust these to actually hold a load, but for the price, they worked perfectly for what I wanted to do as long as I had something else to support the load."
5,top shelf,"buy this , make bread with this, make pizza with this, make pie crusts with this, hit a drunk intruder with this...."
3,Not as advertized,"This appears to be a good rolling pen, however, the description in the ad stated it was a 3 inch Rolling Pen. When I received the order, I was very disappointed because it was only 2 3/4 inch. I returned it for an exchange, because it was the wrong size. I received the 2nd one and it too was another 2 3/4 inch, NOT the 3 inch as described in the ad. I could have bought this size at a local store; I wouldn't have ordered it online had I only known it was not going to be the 3 inch rolling pen. Very frustrating when you go to all the trouble ordering & returning and then receiving another ""WRONG"" item! I would have rated it 4 stars if it had been as described in the ad. I kept it only because I needed to use it, otherwise I would have sent it back again and requested a refund."
2,"3"" x 12"" (almost) Rolling Pin","What a bummer! Just opened the package and slightly disappointed. The rolling pin shipped is the Vic Firth 12"" x 2.75"" pin which can be found nearly anywhere. Hopefully, it was a ""mis pick"" and they still have some of the actual 3"" diameter pins avaialble. I used one of the actual 3"" dia pins in a pastry class and what a big performance difference the small size difference makes!! Will be testing return policy now.Vic Firth 3"" x 12"" Barrel Rolling Pin"
1,Weird texture and more,"This dessert does NOT have a cheesecake texture, which you get in this (and just as easily prepped!)Jell-O No-Bake Real Cheesecake Dessert, 11.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)What the texture is like is just weird - a foamy, airy and lumpy mousse like texture.Two things to watch out: the item contains preservatives and artificial flavor even though the company claims that their products do not contain them. The ingredient list is on their website.The other issue I had is on the front of the pouch it says ""NO COOK"", yet flip over the pouch and the directions tell you to cook the blackberry sauce in a small pot for a minute.Buyer beware.Just go buy a box of Jello Cheesecake - and make with dry milk. It will taste great and cost less. And buy some freeze dried blackberries to go on top."
4,Dead to the World Review,"I thought that this book was pretty good. It stared out sort of slow, but by about page 80, it started to pick up. It was a dark sort of book. It was definately a change from my normal reading. It made me go out and buy more J.N. Williamson books. If you are offended by stronge language, then this book may not be for you. Over all, I thought it was a great book."
1,Broken,I had this shredder for a week and it stopped working without using the override. Sent it back and got a replacement and it didn't work out of the box. I'm going to give it one more try. I'll change my review if warranted.
1,Junk,The first time used for more than 20 pages it stopped for good. Do buy crap like this made in China. I lost everything I spent on it because it broke down after the Amazon 30-day warranty.
4,Definitely better than my last shredder...,"I went from a super cheap shredder, to cheap, to this one...so far so good. Certainly worth the extra few dollars for the extra page capacity and power. Also, I like the safety feature. My biggest disappointment is in the actual cut...to me, confetti cut should look like tiny pieces and not long strips of paper.I like the design...can see how full bin is...has a nice handle...easy to empty. A tad bit disappointed in the run time...seems like it's better for people who shred as they go as opposed to our family who does massive piles of stuff at once. We're hoping that makes us convert to a shred-as-you-go habit...hmmm...perhaps a New Years' resolution in the making :-)"
1,NOT a confetti shredder as advertised,I purchased this shredder because it stated 'Maximum security confetti cut shredder turns documents into unreadable particles'. This is a false claim. The pieces are no different than a regular shredder that cuts in to strips and the paper strips are indeed readable. What a disappointment. Sending it back and will not purchase from Powershred again.
4,Great Home Shredder,Nice machine with good features. One is that there's an opening to put paper items not needing shredding. This is great for envelopes and such as we recycle. I'm surprised that no one else has mentioned this as an attribute. It influenced my buying decision as my way old shredder had this as well and I didn't want to give up this feature. I couldn't find any other shredder that had an opening/space to just dump non-shredding paper into it. I didn't give it five stars because it won't shred CD/DVD's. That seems odd to me.
4,Loved this as a kid!,"I read this book in 6th grade, along with almost all of the realated books. This one always had a special place in my heart. A young girl is visited by her very radical aunt. For the time, her aunt is quite revolutionary as she doesn't wear a corset, didn't take her husband's name and crusades against liquor. The aunt introduces her neice to ideas of suffrage, temperance and racial tolerance through her crusades. As a girl, it was amazing to see how much has changed for women in this country and get an inside look at what it took to create that change. Imagine my surprise to discover that it would have been unheard of to eat rice in America if you weren't Chinese! This book really broadens your perspective, while being funny and exciting."
5,Polo's Interlock has the best quality & fit available!,"Polo's Interlock has the best quality, fit and durability available in this type of shirt! The Interlock fabric is made of 100% soft mid-weight combed cotton in a very tight weave that stretches comfortably in all directions allowing for complete freedom of movement. Polo's Interlock shirt has an exceptionally smooth finish and is available in a broad range of wonderful and unique colors which wear extremely well. Polo's version is intentionally over-sized to allow for shrinkage so order to your correct size and do not go any larger or you will swim in it! Overall, I consider shirts made from this material to be the absolute finest available in the market today! Yes, you may find the Polo brand a bit pricey but rest assured that it's worth every dime to have the best !"

2,didn't work on Samsung Verizon cell extender has advertised,"Hooked it up and put gps antenna by window, didn't work.Not expensive & delivered quickly, but advertisement explicitly mentioned Samsung cell extender"
3,"Quirky, cutting edge, and a little out there...","First, to add a detail to something mentioned by another reviewer... Only DVDs with a Region 1 encoding will play in N. America, the ""Unlimited"" DVD is Region 2. Most consumer DVD players will not play the disk. However, all of the home computers I have tried the disk in play it just fine.As for the book and DVD content, if you're looking for cute Pixar style, Toy Story type shorts this will disappoint you. If you're an animation enthusiast who likes to puzzle out how someone accomplished their work, there's plenty here for you to sink your teeth into. Mostly it's non-narrative works of moving non-representational art. Pretty cool if you're prepared for it before you press ""play""."
2,Pesimo,"He leído varios libros de Barbara Wood, La Vírgenes del Paraiso hasta el momento es el mejor de todos, el resto no son tan buenos, pero este no es malo, es pesimo, tiene pretenciones de gran novela y no llega ni a cuento malo, una intepretación muy elemetal, personal de la historia de la humanidad. Usando como técnica la división de la historia en grandes períodos y diferentes regiones del planeta. Hace mucho tiempo no leía un libro tan malo. No lo pude terminar."
4,great,This holder holds quite a few sticks comfortably. It's great to have when a stick breaks or goes flying. The only bad thing is that it is vertical and not at an angle. Mine also came in black and not red like the picture.
4,Works Fine...But Mine's Black,"When I opened the package it took a minute before I even knew what it was! I was expecting a red stick bag like the picture, but mine was black. Okay, but I'd prefer the red...what I ordered! Anyway, the thing will clamp on almost anywhere, and although the material of the bag is a bit stiff, it does the job."
3,Fair quality,I did not expect too much from this product. I was surprised to discover it was made better than expected.
2,A Romance Junkie,"Flora was engaged to marry Christopher when she met Marco by chance one day. She was almost mugged while waiting for a cab when Marco stepped in and took charge. It was perfect, and as it turned out he had actually planned the whole thing. It would have been a good story but I didn't like Marco at all. I don't know why, maybe he just sounded so damn fake. There was no conflict and Flora along with her ugly name was a bore. You could almost close your eyes and see her bad teeth. I didn't like this story and can't recommend it at all. Unless of course you have no sleeping pills and need something to read that will makes you sleepy."
5,Fabulous for rolling out a pie crust!,"I've been baking pies for almost 40 years, having learned at the elbow of my mother, and after using this marble rolling pin for the first time last week, I produced one of the finest, flakiest pie crusts EVER!Whether it was the weight of the marble or the chill of it, it rolled out my pie crust easier than I've ever before experienced. PLUS, because the dough barely stuck to the marble while I was rolling it out, I used very little flour.I'm very, very happy that I purchased this marble rolling pin. I'd actually wanted one for years, but never got around to actually ordering one. Now, after getting such amazing results, I could kick myself for waiting so long!"
1,disappointed,"i have had this rolling pin for a short amount of time, under 6 months) and it did not hold up at all. At the ends the granite was wearing off into my food products. Needless to say this is no longer being used."
3,"Workmanship disappointing, functionally OK","I was a bit disappointed when the product arrived. I purchased this rolling pin because of the promise of exquisite workmanship from a local American factory with a reputation for the world's finest drumsticks. I was willing to pay a premium price versus cheaper imported versions of the same product. When I first spun the roller and held it up to the light, it was obvious that one edge was not cut perpendicular to the rolling surface. It gave the appearance of a wobbly bicycle wheel. Also, the roller edges were not rounded over or polished, they were lightly chamfered with the grain of the raw marble giving the appearance of dirt around the edges. Functionally, the product worked great; heavy, smooth rolling, and non-stick, and it cleaned up easily afterward."
1,Broken upon Delivery,"I was giving this marble rolling pin as a gift, Not opening it to make it easier to wrap. Finding when the person opened it the marble on the rolling pin was broken in two! I was really upset to find I had given a broken gift."
2,"poster was great, the hangers were horrible",The reprint was great and as expected. The hanging sleeves where not the exact size and kept sliding off. Had to insert paper clips to keep the poster in place....do not recommend.
4,Great & Durable But Expensive,Corelle plates and bowls have been with our household ever since I remember.We used to have (we still have them but they are on the shelves) Corelles with color designs but we decided to stick with simple plain ones which is easier to match.Pros:-Durable. Me and my wife have dropped them many times; and they don't break easily.-Scratch & knife resistant.-Light. Less stress for our kitchen shelves.-Microwave safe-Easy to clean-Dishwasher safeCons:-Expensive for a single plate
1,Clint,"I never received the platter I ordered, instead I was sent a little saucer, about six inches across. Worthless item, returned it, lost my shipping and handling charge to them, and still don't have a platter!! I really wanted a second one for Thanksgiving, but rather than get sent another ""butter dish"" by these jokers, I just went up to Target and bought one.They didn't look at what I ordered or what they sent. Poor service.Clint."
5,Great,"Another book, another class, in great condition. This one was interesting as subject matter, but written in a dry voice that was hard to read for long lengths of time."
1,Don't bother,"I'm an adult and bought the game for my 12 yr old son. Needless to say, I'm the one addicted. This book is really useless. The only thing it's worthwhile for is that you get to see all the misc. items your dog can pick up in the street. Other than that, everything else you can pretty much learn from the guide within the game."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"First off, half of this book just talks about the actual pups themselves. Then the other half is wasted on informing you on very obvious things. The only thing useful in it is that it tells SOME of the tricks your dogs can do and how to teach them... Just don't bother buying..."
4,pups:nintendogs guidebook,"overall this is a really nice book. it gives you an overview of all the puppies (where they originated, etc) and tips on how to care for your new sweetie. i really enjoyed the section on 'puppy problems'(earning money, nutty puppy syndrome, multiple puppy personalities, trick confusion, etc) and pet supplies (an extensive inventory of all the things you can buy or find in the game). i do wish it went over more than the basic tricks though :-) 4 stars."
4,Nintendogs Companion,My 10 year old daughter loves this book. It gives more information about the dogs and how to care for them.
4,Good characters but only fair animation,"The characters are what Crest of the Stars is all about. In the course of the story, you will be able to learn how the characters came to be who they are and where they hope to be able to go in their lives. The plot is adventure with a warm and fuzzy aspect. It's neither a memorable plot nor a potboiler, but it is entertaining.I felt that the animation was a failing in Crest of the Stars. It wasn't good enough to match the story. For example, the spaceships look like something from a Manga comic book. It is as if the producer put so much effort into developing the characters that he didn't have any energy left for the animation. The animation made it impossible for me to consider giving Crest of the Stars 5 stars.The english title of the series changes to Banner of the Stars in the next installment and it is available from Amazon. I haven't bought it yet and I do not know if the animation was improved in the next installment."
4,CREST OF THE STARS,"I had reservations about Crest of the Stars when I began it. The animation is not up to modern standards but as the it progressed I found the story line made up for that.I liked it and would recommend it. I'm considering buying the other titles in the series, which is the best endorsement I could give it."
5,Does the job!,"Both attractive and functional, this zester is a great tool to have around. It works much better than a grater, which wastes most of the fruit peel."
3,Cinderella,The video was in good condition. I did buy it used. I used to watch this movie once a year when I was growing up. I get to watch it whenever I want to now. This is my 3rd copy.
2,Let's make a baby!,"Sara Johanson wanted a child and a family of her own more than anything. So when she showed up on her husband's estranged doorstep, she expected his signature on four-year-old divorce papers--not an enthusiastic offer to make babies with her. A whole passel of them no less!Something changed the driven businessman she'd married, but had hardly seen. With a menagerie of animals and an infant to baby-sit, Steve seemed more...domestic and more sexy than ever to Sara. But he still delivered knee-knocking kisses as skillfully as he'd negotiated deals. Steve always got what he wanted--and now he wanted to be a daddy."
4,Quality book,This book is a great reference book. The book highlights all the information worth knowing in a compact form. The only thing that did not make this book perfect is that it did not come with a tutorial on how to do some of the demonstration. Still a great book worth buying even if you are just starting autocad.
5,We love bear in the big blue house,Bear in the Big Blue House: Sleepy Time With Bear and FriendsThe best

4,"Great DVD, but title is misleading","Only one of the 3 episodes on this DVD is about bedtime, which was disappointing. However, ir's still a cute ""Bear"" DVD. I haven't found that this video is helpful in getting my 2 year old to go to bed, because she's so stimulated by Bear, so I wouldn't reccommend purchasing this DVD for that purpose. I *do* reccommend buying it based on the fact that Bear In The Big Blue House is one of the most charming children's shows today! My daughter loves to dance when Bear Dances, and Tutter just cracks her up!"
1,MEMOIR IS NOW A NOVEL,"I couldn't find any subsance to this book. I doubt the author has ever planned a funeral for a family member, or anyone, maybe if she had a better book would have been written. My MAIN COMPLAINT is when I searching for a book I searched ""funeral planner memoir"" and this is one of the books that came up. I don't know if it is something the author puts in description or something else, all I can say is I am sorry I wasted money purchasing this book. One good lesson I learned is to buy from AMAZON', then you get your money back. I unfortunateh bought this as a paperback at another retailer and it is tough luck for me, maybe I can sell for .25 at a garage sale!!"
2,Dead Book,"I love my chick-lit. This I did not love. Actually, I didn't even really like it. If you are engrossed in business start up and things of that nature, then this chick-lit is right down your alley. Me, I was frustrated from the start and I don't really even know why I finished it. Good luck to those that read this!"
2,A Grave Disappointment,"Forget any sensitive handling of the subject matter or any emotional at all from the characters. I find it unbelievable how much this novel reads like Jessica Mitford and other writers on the subject, only bent and warped into fictional prose. If I wanted to read rote facts, I'd go do so. Where's the meaning?"
4,A Fun Story for the Entrepreneur in All of Us,"The Funeral Planner is the first fiction I've read in years. I guess,like Maddy Banks, I've got too much to accomplish to fool around with fluff like fiction.Over the last few weeks I found time to get half way though the book. I spent last weekend finishing up seaside on Palm Island in Florida. What a treat to leisurely follow along with Maddy's adventures.If you have ever started a business, or in the midst of starting a business right now, here's your opportunity to match characters and stories with all the people and predicaments you will bump into along your way."
3,so-so read,"Something about this book just didn't grab my attention. Maybe it was the story or the plot that I just couldn't identify with. Either way, I did read read the whole thing. Some parts I did enjoy but then others were just so boring I'd want to put the book down. This is the first book I read by this author so I dont know if her book being unenjoyable is a one time thing for me. Who knows? Maybe I'll get into her next book she releases, if there is going to be one."
4,"Devious witty satire with a little romance, too!","I picked this up in desperation in the airport for the first leg of a business trip & found myself engrossed all the way from NYC to Scotsdale. This is a fresh & clever take on the heroine's journey, complete with wise advisors, betrayers who represent the worst parts of ourselves, true friends, and the love we can never find until we find ourselves. What makes it really special, however, is the wonderful work setting - it's a terrific satiric dissection of both funeral & wedding planning, two of our society's most dysfunctional social rituals. To fit this book in a chick lit framework takes a devious and witty mind indeed, so 3 cheers for Lynn Isenberg, and here's hoping she tackles the $100,000 wedding phenomenon head on next!"
1,Shoddy at best,"I had a really hard time with this book- in fact, I am still struggling through it, determined to finish.Quite frankly, what first turned me off was the whole character of Uncle Sam. I wanted to hit him, and the narrator, repeatedly with a large stick. The character of Sam himself was entirely fake, and so was the relationship between him and Maddy. I could barely stomach it.There were a few grammatical errors that I couldn't believe passed under the radar, as well, and in general, I've found the writing to be very dull and shallow.I also have a hard time following a timeline in this book- what seems like a few days turns out to be, in actuality, a few months. There are no ""time buoys"", so to speak- very few landmarks.I recommend you stay away from this book."
4,A toy that MOMMIES and DADDIES love!,"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was 18 months old. I was going into the hospital for an operation and wanted something special that she would enjoy while I was away. My daughter has great fine-motor coordination and this was the perfect challenge for her. By the time she was 2 she was practically an expert, showing others how to do it -- and loving it every time. Since then, what we call ""the giraffe toy"" has been through my now 3-year-old twins -- who were much rougher on it than my older daughter. It's held up perfectly & since there are no pieces to lose, it's an ideal toy for trips or practically anywhere. I only wish that there were more ""smart"" toys like this out there!"
4,"An earnest, well-made, very watchable film","This is a solid film that deserved a much better fate. It's well-written and directed and the story is compelling. Moreover, the actors are uniformly excellent including those both known (Rita Moreno, James Darren) and unknown (Asher Brauner, Henry Sanders, Michelle Davison). In addition, singer/songwriter Richie Havens both acts in the film (he too is quite good) and sings two very listenable songs on the soundtrack. Also, the film approaches issues of race & social standing in a very mature manner.After viewing ""The Boss's Son"" I'm anxious to see more of director Bobby Roth's work (which isn't always easy to locate). If you're sitting-on-the-fence about this one, in its gritty, 70s-style realism it reminded me of the wonderful ""Blue Collar""Blue Collar (Amazon.com Exclusive), so if you enjoyed that film, you should find this an equally compelling work."
2,Didn't care for this one,"Another one I bought because James Darren was in it. The performances are good, but the two best known actors Rita Moreno and James Darren weren't given a whole lot to do. Other than that it seems like a TV movie with R rated language."
2,Alot of padding in this book to get more pages!,"I thought the book was a good intro to ADO.NET until I realized that every single example is repeated twice! Once with VB code and once with C# code. But instead of just putting both the VB and C# code, they actually repeat all the pictures (which are the same) and all the steps (which are the same). I thought this was a really lousy way to trick the customer into thinking they were getting a more in depth book. Approx half the pages in this book say the same thing!"
1,Can You Say Refund?,This book is full of errors. I do not know how you others can say the example code and even the code typed in the text of the book is accurate enough! Did you actually code as you read this book? I spent a lot of time rewriting the code to get it to work - I got to the point where I was spending more time fixing the code than concentrating on the lesson itself.Save your money - buy from WROX Press instead. I deviated this one time and this is where it got me - 40 bucks in the hole.
2,Stay away from the light Carol Ann,"You have to know either VB of C# pretty well and be prepared to make guesses as to what ""in"" ""after"" and ""your installation"" mean. Sorry Becca . . . Give me FULL direction; Give me complete examples, and Tell me why I am doing this !! !! !!This will be the slowest ""Step By Step"" book you read. (My 4th in as many weeks).Maybe the next one will be better."
2,Uninspiring,"Not much to add to other negativ comments here. I somehow figured if it's from MSPress, it's gotta be good.I'm at page 150 (of 500, ughh) and already found several timeconsuming mistakes in the examples. The chapters are boring and a pain at the same time. I often find myself guessing where to add lines. It reads like a helpfile generated from sourcecomments...The mixing of VB.net and C#.net isn't very helpful either. They'd rather make one book each.Oh well, gonna hangle thru it anyway (as fast as possible).NOT recommended"
4,"Nice fast-track into the technology, but limiting in details","The book for me basically killed 3 birds with one stone. I am an experienced database application developer, but not in vb.net, c#, or ado.net. I did the exercises both in vb.net and c#. As for the program bugs, annoying, but having to debug some of the programs just helped me learn the language syntax. As for the ado.net, not confusing, but would have like to see more details in the concepts/topics the chapters were trying to explain. Over all, the book for me was nice fast-track into the technology, but limiting in details."
2,Book is too tightly coupled on integration with UI,"It seems every example in this book involves using Wizards and Data Binding.If you are writing some sort of logging application that doesn't have anything to do with UI, this is not a good book from which to learn.Starting with databinding creates lots of generated code which is almost overwhelming to take in all at once.Lots of space is wasted in this book... Too many pictures, not enough code.When there is code, it is repeated in both basic and c#. While this seemed like a benefit at first, it now feels like eating up space that could have been used for more code. I am going to try to find another book that has a different approach.If data binding is your thing, you might see this book differently. While I didn't compile every example, the ones I did worked (contrary to some other reviewers)"
1,Not for Starters,"This book is not for starters. People who are staring up with ADO.net or event have some experience in ADO do not use this book. It was such a waste of money for me. I recommend the following book for starters ""murach's vb.net database programming with ado.net"" for vb programmers."
5,Worth it for one example,"I understand some folks are having problems with the examples, but honestly the one I needed (related to data relations and binding relations to dropDownLists) worked like a champ, and that example alone saved me tons of time. I had a problem with my own example using Datarelations and the author responed pretty quickly with an explanation of what the common problems might be. It did not in the end resolve my problem entirely, but it did show that this feature of ADO.NET worked and the problem in my code was really mine. This one working example was more than worth the price of admission for me."
3,"It is okay, not like other Step by Step Books.","I basically got this book for the main reason my text book for my course i am taking is not the best and is a little vague at times.Here's the thing, it is not like the other SBS books, the chapters (at least to me) seem out of order, for example, chapters 6 to 8 are relating the dataTables, dataViews, etc, after you are creating them.... Most the items that I feel are the basics are found after you go through a bunch of code that is unrelated. Luckily I do not feel this book is a complete waste of money; there are things that will make it a really good reference book, other then that, get something else if you are looking to learn."
4,"Good, but not for VB.NET / C# Newbies","This has a number of good examples, real enough that you can use them as a stepping stone to your own programming.This book is also something of a 'Rosetta Stone' by listing the equivalent VB.NET and C# code for exploiting ADO.NET.Shortcomings? Well, the examples, as noted in many other reviews, require a level of expertise in VB.NET and/or C# that frustrates folks who just finished a language 'step-by-step' book. Sometimes the objects that connect to Access and SQL Server databases need a tweak for your particular machine, and the error messages generated may send you scrambling for the installlation notes.Anoher caveat is that you can't run the ASP.NET examples with a standalone XP Home Edition system - it doesn't include IIS.Nonetheless, a good book, perhaps one you'll want to keep as a reference."
1,Multitude of Mistakes,Whilst I think the content ie Technical background given in this book is fairly good I must say the Code examples and explanations given are absolutely awful! Did anyone at Microsoft even check to see if these code examples ran ? If they said they did then they are lying. I've been doing .NET development seriously for about 6 months now and I believe this is the most careless book I have ever read. Stay away from this book until they fix the multitude of mistakes.
1,Just read 90% of these reviews.,"The main reason i'm even writing this review is because for some reason I didn't think to look at book reviews before picking up this book. Little did I know that this book is actually a great door-stop and nothing more. Just read most of the reviews here and you will understand why.-Poor coding-Poor format...etcPlease pick up anything else! I really enjoyed ""Database Programming with C#"" as it is much clearer and written much better."
1,Do not spend money on this book!,"Wait for a colleage to waste $40 on it, then pick it out of the trash. I can hardly believe that Microsoft would put their imprimatur on such a book. Numerous code samples simply do not work. Connection strings for Riordan's own installation have to be replaced; it you don't know already know something about ADO.NET, you'll be in despair. The format is a ""color by numbers"" sort of thing; the various objects are poorly explained. Different ways of creating objects should not be mixed together in the same program; it makes the source unreadable, and pedagogically useless.I learned a lot trying to fix the errata myself; I should get paid."
2,Not the greatest that 3M has ever produced,I purchased this product based on it being a 3M product...but I have to say I am disappointed. There is no way to lock it to the size that you want which just makes it awkward when trying to move it because as you are moving/rolling the entire device is trying to move also very poorly made. If it was worth my time to send it back I would but for less than 20 dollars it isn't really worth the time.I will look elsewere for the perfect PC cart but this is definitely not it.
3,Picture is deceiving,"The picture of this product is misleading. It looks like the CPU is in a cradle at the bottom when, in fact, it is just sitting on an ""X"" frame. When I received it I thought they had shipped the wrong product."
1,Flimsy piece of junk,"It doesn't roll smoothly. There's no easy way to lock the thing to the size of your CPU, so the legs kind of splay, and it's unstable when you move it. Buy something else."
4,stylish & sturdy,accommodates my mid-tower computer chassis easily. 4 pegs have some clear cushioning to avoid scratching the case. expands to fit a variety of case sizes. took some extensive searching to find decent price + shipping.
1,seriously... CPU stand???,"the CPU is the processor... the brain of the computer, it's an internal component that you don't need a stand for!"
2,Actually has 360 mg,"The true dose is only revealed by adding the EPA and the DHA. One softgel has 216 mg of EPA and 144 mg of DHA. So, one softgel has 360 mg of helpful fish oil and the remaining 840 mg is filler fish oil.When comparing fish oil, look at the back panel supplement facts. Add the EPA and DHA to get the true MG and make sure you look at the serving size. Nature made has 2 softgels per serving size, so you must divide by 2 to get the per softgel info.Twin Labs Mega appears to have the highest combo"

4,made skin softer,"and hands look less wrinkled. it did not make me smell bad, have bad breath, or give me and upset stomach, i took it for about 2 and a half weeks when i noticed that my skin felt so much softer, and hair is growing faster and my nails look a little better and hands look allot less old. face also. and knees too. pills are a bit big though for me. i took 2 once a day before bed almost every night."
4,Great Idea for a starter,"This is a great gadget, but a bit messy! I wouldn't want to be without it and would surely love to see it improved. Wish someone would come up with an electric or hand cranked tenderizer with teeth on opposing sides that steaks, chops, etc. can be processed through without splattering the walls, cabinets, and anything sitting on them! There are commercial ones, why not ones for home use?"
4,Excellent item,It worked exactly as I expected. It pounded my Chicken to the point I should practically see through it if I wanted. I put the chicken in a ziplock first and there was no clean up to speak of. It also washed up fast and easy. Easy to hold.
4,Good product,Used it to make pork cutlet. It's sturdly and worked well but I wish the head was a bit bigger to cover more area.
4,Good Basic Boot,"For the price, this is a well built boot. Just be sure to order at least a half size smaller than shoe size--or a full size if you want a snug fit."
5,"My favorite fantasy book ever,",and I have read a lot of fantasy books. I really like the dark and intricate stories being woven throughout this novel.
3,average earrings,nothing special about these. certainly could have used the money for someting better.
2,Poorly constructed,I am in agreement with some of the other reviews. I bought the totes brand because I thought the brand symbalized quality.. boy was I wrong. After using it twice the metal supports broke and the exposed metal tore the fabric. It has a guarantee alright.. You are guaranteed to pay for twice for this product. Once on the initial purchase and again to ship it to them and pay them $5 to send it back. The only winners are the shipping companies. A cheap umbrella with an expensive name..
1,Poor Showing,"I've had good experience with Tote's in the past, which is why I purchased this one. It didn't even last through the first heavy rainstorm. The umbrella I bought from a local drugstore for half the price fared better."
2,Poorly written and outdated.,"While this book contains some useful information, it is not specific enough to be of much value in most areas. Some of the author's comments made me wonder if this book wasn't really written in the 1980's. For example, when discussing floppy drives he recommends installing both a 3 1/2"" and a 5 1/4"" drive! My guess is that this book is based on ""Build Your Own 286 PC and Save a Bundle"" and the word ""Pentium"" was simply substituted everywhere that ""286"" had appeared! Also, the author's writing style is very poor which makes this book very tedious to read."
1,Days of Our Lives 2006 Calendar-Still Waiting for it!! I got it and it's a 5 star!!,"I would love to rate the calendar as I believe it would be a 5 star. But I have not received it as of yet and very sad! Hope it will come soon. That is the only reason I put a 1 star. Sad but true, calendar where are you!?!? It's great and a 5 star, happy when it arrived."
3,Too small for my teacup yorkie,I'm not exactly sure how small a dog needs to be to fit into the XS size sweater but this was too small for my 4lb teacup yorkie. It's cute though
1,Waste of money,Waste of money did nothing except turn the food into pudding at best. My fish did nothing more or less with or with-out it
5,Moosylvania,"Volume 7 is a keeper like the rest of the series, but there is something you should know about it. It has 2 R&B stories on it, one where they campaign for the statehood of Moosylvania, and another where they try to stop Boris & Natasha's assault on Moosylvania. That would seem to be a plus, but these episodes are a little shorter than the episodes on the other tapes. Aside from that, it's as good as the other tapes.Along with those 2 episodes, it comes with Aesop and Son talking about a Mice Trapped Cat, Mr. Know-It-All deals with a star, Bullwinkles Corner spotlights Tom, A Piper's Son, and Fractured Fairy Tales gives us its rendition of Red Riding Hood."
5,Whistler's Moose is a good video full of laughs and puns,"""Moosylvania"" takes place on this video. It has 2 plots both involving Moosylvania. But wait, that is not all you don't just get 2 wonderful plots of Rocky and Bullwinkle you get other Jay Ward cartoons features on the Rocky and Bullwinkle show. I'd highly recommend buying this tape it is worth it.Chris Vardeman E-mail me! END"
2,great shoes but don't last,This is my 3rd or 4th pair of Ecco. The rubber does start to disinegrate especially in the toe area.I keep buying them because I'm on my feet all day long and they are the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn.They last 1- 2 yrs at best before the rubber breaks down. It's your callIf they were $99 I would buy them 6 at a time for fear that they would stop making them
5,Great Shoes,"My new ECCO Men's Track II are the fourth pair I've had in the last sereral years. I wear them for almost all occasions except for the most formal. They are comfortable, good looking, and durable. It's most convenient to get them on-line through Amazon."
5,ECCO Men's Track II Low_ Wearing Heaven,"I'm wearing my 5th pair that was purchased from a local department store over 5 years ago, I wear them almost every day, this pair has lasted the longest. Usually I get 1-1/2 to 2 years out of a pair. I'm not sure why these are still running pretty strong. Clean them occassionally, treat the leather and nubuck properly and they last a long time. I tried the boots once, they were okay but a bit bulky for me. I've had to take this pair to a local shoe cobbler twice to have the stitching on the top corners sewn, $20 each time. It is nearly impossible to find a shoe like this that fits and feels perfect right out of the box. I've tried several other brands that are nice shoes, but I always return to these."
5,SAME QUALITY AS I HAVE KNOWNED,"I had a pair of these shoes 18 years ago when I use to go hiking with my son and daugther, they lasted for 10 years until the sole run out. Now I have used them for walking and my feet remember them, cushioning every step.How do I clean or polish them?"
2,Wrong color sent,"While we received the correct shoe style, the color is nowhere close to what was pictured. I ordered 2 pairs and they were very, very dark - no anything like the color shown. I have returned them both. :("
3,"Good, not Great Shoes","When I bought the ECCOs I have now, they were the correct size, but were very tight on the top of my foot and I had to stretch them to wear them. Once they were broken in, they were very comfortable. The soles did start to wear through to the subsole after less than two years, but I am still wearing them and hope to get at least three years out of them. I walk a lot on paved surfaces so this isn't as bad as it might seem. The soles of the ECCO boots I bought five or six years ago did in fact disintegrate leaving pieces all over the place. It makes me wonder what's wrong with the management of this company."
2,Disappointed these didn't fit!,"These shoes seem to be very nicely made and have a wonderful appearance. Unfortunately, the 16-16.5 D shoe didn't work for my size 16D foot. They were unacceptably tight across the top of my foot, more than I believed could be remedied by using a shoe tree. The length was good, but the width and fit was small. I wonder if they use a standard last to form these. Anyway, will return and try again with something different."
1,Will fall apart!!!!,Many others have the exact same experience. The soles literally disintegrate off the bottom of the shoe! Ecco does not care. They have a one year policy. Do a search on these and most of the other Ecco brand shoes and you will then learn the awful truth about this company. These soles are now made in China and the quality reflects that.Stay away!!!!
1,These shoes Self Destruct,"This shoe is great in every regard-comfort,fit,style, waterproofing, appearance except one thing. The soles will self destruct after short wear especially if exposed to wet conditions. I know the uppers are Goretex lined but the soles are junk and break down under wet conditions. Not sure? Just do a search for Ecco shoe problems. It is a known problem with the manufacturer not providing a fix. A cottage industry has now started for shoe repair companies specializing in replacing the factory soles with Vibram soles that are reliable."
1,Don't Be Soled,I've had two pair of these over the years. Unfortunately after about a year or so you begin to feel like Hansel and Gretel leaving pieces of the sole wherever you go. On both pairs the soles literally disintegrate. Since I only wear them in the winter months it really cuts short their life expetency. This is not a new problem since my first pair was purchased 10 years ago and like a sucker I tried them again recently and got burned again. I like the shoes and they are comfortable but for this to happen twice is totally unacceptable especially given their price. Try something else.
1,Where's your soul ECCO ?,Not only the high price for my Ecco boots and shoe`s the soles rip off .I am a disabled US Marine Korean WAr veteran and I bought them because the material was soft and very comfortable but like the soles I got ripped off.I E-MAILED the company but never received a reply!
1,It is very very uncomfortable,"the ankle is too low, they are very very uncomfortable. i like Ecco, but, this style is JUNK. Do NOT buy it."
5,Best Shoes I Have Ever Had,These are the fifth pair of these shoes that I have purchased. They are the best shoes I have ever owned. I have worn them in all different settings ranging from hikes in national forests to everyday use. I recommend these shoes highly.
3,Never again.,"In preparation for an international tour, I bought the Ecco Track II Low on a recommendation from the tour company. Although the shoes seem well made, the stock insoles had to be replaced immediately for lack of arch support. A pair of SuperFeet cured this. I also noticed a lot of heel slip while walking, which I was told is intentional. As for traction, I slipped on a patch of ""black-ice"" on my own brick walkway and fell, seriously injuring my shoulder. Not the shoe's fault? Perhaps, but my wife didn't slip in her Keens. In fact, she helped pick me back up (on the black-ice). After such a bad experience, I'm never purchasing another pair of Eccos again. I feel they're overpriced and overrated."
2,Shoddy workmanship.,"I love ECCO shoes. I was so excited when I got these to replace a pair I have been wearing almost every day for 2 years. They were comfortable when I put them on, as ECCOs always are, but the FIRST time I laced them up one of the metal half-moon things for the laces to go through broke. The problem wasn't the metal, it was that it was attached to the shoe by a leather sheath that broke. I sent them back, and rather than have them send a new pair, went to the Walking Store and got a different style that actually has metal grommets for the laces to go through."
3,Some tradeoffs but acceptable,"I bought this shoe based on its sturdy appearance. After nine months, the shoes have held up extremely well under all conditions. The materials, fit & finish and appearance are all intact. The soles show little signs of wear. The laces are beefy. The performance in rain is outstanding. The sole is grippy.These shoes look great, but I could not wear them everyday. For me, they're a tad on the heavy side and the sturdiness makes for a stiffer feel that can take a toll on your feet after a long day. During the first couple of weeks, the tongue felt uncomfortable against my foot, even after adjusting the laces. After the break in period, all was right as rain.I would buy again, but at the rate these are wearing, it'll probably be a long time before I wear them out."
5,"Daughter of a Sicilian immigrant, I LOVED IT!!!!!","to Mr. Scaivelli, The chapter about Nana Caterina was wonderful! When my sister read the part about the potatoes on Nana's head to my mother, my sister said ""Ma, isn't that weird"", while laughing loudly. To which my mother replied, very seriously,""lemons yes, but not potatoes""!!!!! We were in stiches."
5,The Good Old Days,"I grew up in this neighborhood during the time he speaks about, and it was exactly as he describes it. The S.A.C.'s, the gangs, the feasts, the recipes, the stores on Knickerbocker Avenue, the way our family members spoke - I still talk Brooklynese! It's a great book. Brings back so many memories.....if you had any connection to this Bushwick neighborhood during the 50's and 60's, you must read this book."
4,knife sharpener,"these are good for taking with on a long hiking trip, they are small and lite, and work nice. not as fast working as larger 4"" or 6 or 8"" but way liter and small."
4,convenient!,"this is a nice set of compact 'stones' - i used my set to reprofile and put a nice a edge on my Kabar BK11 (the factory edge leaves much to be desired)i also had an old plastic hunting permit wallet that holds all three of the conveniently together...this kit is going into the bug-out bag that i use when fishing at the beach - my hooks are going to be super sharp now!i like how these are so easy to clean and how little pressure is required to sharpen my pocketknivesthe assortment is a bonus...the only thing i'd like to see is DMT to come out with this package in dual-sided grits, and include either an extra-coarse or super-fine card"
5,Great Field Sharpeners,After receiving these sharpening cards I must say I am very impressed. The cards are -as the name implies- about the size of a credit card (a tad smaller). I love how it comes with three different textures because it allows you to fix an edge no matter what condition it's in. The cards don't weigh much and can very easily slip in to a pack and allow for quick field sharping on a knife or even an axe or hatchet. i would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a way to sharpen their cutting tools for a cheap price and great portability.
1,There should be no such thing as elective c-section.,"I got this book from the library while reading up as much as possible on childbirth in prepartion for a new position as a labor and delivery RN. I'm so glad I didn't spend money on it. I could only get through the first few chapters before I became so angry that I couldn't finish it. C sections are MAJOR SURGERY. Though invaluable when needed to save a life, there should be no such thing as an ""elective"" c section. This author is a typical, medical-minded OB-GYN, treating childbirth as a medical problem to be solved instead of as a natural (and wonderful) part of LIFE. There are much better ways to address pelvic floor issues (see the other 1 star posts). Talk to a few women who have had complications from c sections and you might hear a very different story."
5,...an incredible story,"When I finished Batavia's Graveyard"" I had the same sheepish feeling I had upon finishing ""Endurance"" a few years ago - ""How could I have not heard of this story before now?!?"" Of course, Shackleton has received quite a bit of recognition in the last few years. I somehow doubt Cornelius will achieve the same following...!Not much to add that hasn't been well articulated in previously posted comments. I read a favorable review in the Washington Post's Sunday Book World and ordered it the next day. It more than met expectations and made for great (if not grisly) beach reading. The timing of the rescue ship appearing over the horizon is right out of a Hollywood director's script.In addition to providing a depiction of early 17th century Dutch life, it is an incredible story of adventure, desperation, ruthlessness, treachery, and survival, all wonderfully researched and depicted by the author."
3,Good but too much!,"I have long been a big fan of history and all that has made it. I found this book to give excellent insight into the hard life of sea voyage but it seemed overloaded with fact, though that may be a strange thing to say about a historical recount of something. The book read more like an outline of events rather than a retelling of a horrific tale. As a result, the book did not have as much of an impact as it promised. I recommend the book but if you skip over every other page you would not lose anything."
3,Well Researched,"Mr. Dash clearly did his homework for this one. His background information, such as the life of an apothecary in the 17th century, was more interesting than the central story - the gory mutiny after the Batavia's shipwreck. At least fifty per cent of the book is spent relating such background. At times it was distractingly tedious (especially his relating of religious fanaticism in Holland), but overall it added depth to the book. Since the plot line after the wreck is fairly thin - the thugs killed and then killed some more - Mr. Dash did well to make this into a full-length book. If you enjoyed this book, you should definitely read Nathaniel's Nutmeg. It is a more captivating history of this period."
4,Mayhem on the High Seas,"""Batavia's Graveyard"" is further proof of the old adage that ""fact is stranger than faction."" In this obscure but intriguing tale early 17th century European history, Jeronimus Corneliszoon, an unaccomplished Dutch pharmacist, incites a mutiny on the shipwrecked Dutch merchant vessel ""Batavia"", ultimately leading to the slaughter of over 100 men, women, and children who survived the wreck. Painstakingly researched and rich in historical detail, Mike Dash succeeds in combining a rare insight of the arduous life aboard sailing ships of the period with a chilling narrative of the bloodiest known mutiny of all time. One not need to be a history buff to appreciate this brutal story of a charismatic but twisted psychopath capable of mesmerizing the crowd, and leading them to a catastrophic end."
5,Drunk In Public,"We showed this film after reading the short story written about Mark David Allen. Some of the clients responded with ""I know many people like him"" others responded ""I can't believe we let our addiction get so bad."" Life is real, sobriety is real and relapse is real. For those of you who have an addiction I urge you to get help there are many options now days for help just ask. To the gentleman who friend-ed Mark God Bless you."
1,unhappy,"I was so excited to open the box and try my first capuccino. What disappointment! After half a dozen attempts my husband and I were unable to make a drink that was any warmer than lukewarm. Additionally, we thought it was a hassle to wait for the coffee drink to finish pouring, and then for the water to warm up before we could steam the milk. We were used to doing both simultaneously. Lastly, we had trouble finding two cups small enough to fit under the nozzle. A big thumbs down, ...."
3,"Good coffee, but cleanup difficult...","This machine makes decent espresso, but it has some design flaws that should be taken into consideration:-Cleaning up is difficult. The grounds holder cannot be entirely cleaned, and it's receptacle on the machine is hard to get to. I had to get some Q-tips in order to get to the hard to reach places.-The frother is also hard to clean. It must be unscrewed (very easy to get burned here) and each part individually attended to. It is also positioned poorly. Very little room between it and the countertop.-These are important considerations, because the buildup of old grounds and oils can quickly ruin a cup of coffee, and if you use a mug to froth the milk, get a very small one!"
5,Faster - Better - Cheaper,Having read all of the reviews on this Espresso maker I decided to risk replacing my [expensive] machine for the Briel. I too was disconcerted to find that the little piece of plastic rolling around in the box was the control slider for the amount of espresso you wanted however it slips back on and does what it is supposed to do. The crema is consistently the best and the steamer will steam enough milk for two lattes in about one minute. It is far above my old expensive machine and the price makes it the best buy in the past year for me.
