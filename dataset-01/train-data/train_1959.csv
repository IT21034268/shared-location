5,Very Helpful,"This book and the related videos gave me a new framework in which to think about guitar note arrangements. It is quite different from most guitar books I've encountered. It is easier to use than most. There are plenty of references to popular songs.Mr. Serna does an excellent job of introducing chord progressions, the CAGED system of looking at the fretboard, and modes. Mr. Serna has related videos and some free podcast downloads and other information at his website: [...]For a late beginning to intermediate guitar player this book would be excellent. (There was one review posting from someone who sounds advanced and was disappointed.)"
1,Yet another pattern book.,"I hate to admit it as I got sucked into this purchase as well. In short, if you are a beginning guitarist and want to learn primarily how pentatonic scales relate to popular songs and the C-A-G-E-D methodology of visualizing the keyboard then this is for you...there are better (and real) theory books out there."
4,Communication,"For me the most important aspect of learning anything is how the material is communicated. Desi does a great job of communicating in a precise, no nonsense practical manner that makes the material easy to absorb. Desi is genuinely interested in teaching and it shows."
5,Excellent Breakdown of CAGED,"I have been playing guitar for a number of years and I found the layout that Desi uses to teach the CAGED system to be very refreshing. All pentatonic boxes are taught seperately then together according to chord forms. Better yet, real-world songs are given as examples to practice the scales."
4,"Overall, a good product","We purchased two of these spice racks for our pantry. We needed two since these racks are a little on the small side (although a lot of the racks we looked at were smaller still) and I have a lot of spices. We've been pleased. The three smaller shelves are a perfect fit for the standard spice jars from the grocery store and the fourth will fit larger items such as salt.The only negative for the product is installation. The rack comes with four small screws and four mounting brackets. The screws were too short to give a nice, solid mounting; we used our own and the racks are there to stay."
2,changiz,For reading this book you have to have very good sight of eyes because of its size and the size of fonts. That is ok if you use a suitable pare of glasses. You can rarely find an example sentence for 10000 words in this book and for myself I decided to put it aside for maybe ever. After 5 days of ordering I received it in my letter box in Norway.
2,impressive but incomprehensible,"This book was given to me as a gift and I was pleased to get it because I know Prof. Flieger's reputation is high among academics. I'm a Tolkien fan and have read a number of other scholarly books about Tolkien. I don't think I'm a particularly dense person, I graduated from college, but just could not follow any of the arguments in this book. I've tried twice to read it but finally had to give up. I guess if you're breathing rarified air of Tolkien academia it might make some sense, but mostly it just struck me as words piled on words. I ddidn't come away with any new insights - just a sense of... HUH? I give this book two stars for effort - she obviously knows a lot about her subject, but this reads like an obscure doctoral dissertation. I just couldn't stick it out. Sorry."
3,Not much time lost,"3 1/2Worthwhile short-length introduction into the light-prog, dark-rock band that sounds more organically spirited than future suggestion."
1,Damaged During Shipping,"The counter mat was damaged when I received it, the vendor shipped me another one, and it was more damaged than the first one. They were both probably damaged in shipping by the appearances of the boxes. I decided not to try for a third one, and the vendor gave me a full credit."
5,A great product for many uses.,I use it for barriers between refrigerators and stoves or when I am serving many hot dishes for a holiday meal.
5,Exactly what I needed,I am a caterer. I was looking for something to put under my chaffing pans to protect the table underneath from the heat of the pans. These work perfectly and look exceptionally classy.
5,Moving Stories,"I have just finished reading these stories and what I can say is that they are really exceptional. One fells in love with the characters, even with the most disgusting ones, since the author finds a light deep inside each human being he creates through the words, whether a miserable ""mushik"" or a refined ""barin"".Feelings somewhat opossed like desperation, compassion, anguish and beatitude arise every now and then along the pages, leading the reader through a vast gallery of situations and characters."
2,Poor translations--forget it.,"Sorry, I have to differ from my fellow reviewers.The translations here by Constance Garnett are tired and clunky and way too literal. The art of translation has evolved light years from the ""word-by-word"" school. To compare how much more ""modern"" Chekhov can sound (and Chekhov was, is, and will remain always MODERN), read Robert Payne's translations. Payne eliminates the clumsy clauses and unnecessary commas and lets the story shine through.Ford's introduction is interesting, but note: he says NOTHING about the translations. He must know they are abominable. Personally, I have no respect for Richard Ford and Ecco Press for reprinting these. Screw the reader, right?"
2,expected a lot more..,"poor production, made in a hurry..not recommended at least not at that price.."
4,Demo or Die!,Just bought a copy from a museum shop in Helsinki and cancelled my order. The book is well written and has great visuals. You can get it for a cheaper price from other online shops if you live in Europe. Just use google etc.
4,post-punk stereolab,"if you've heard of mccarthy, you're most likely either a post-punk fanatic or a major stereolab fan. when i first picked up this record, i was surprised: while the roots of stereolab's now trademark melodic repetitions and the politics are here, the record is more reminiscent of the smiths or the housemartins.this is not to say the record is bad: it's actually quite nice. the songs are solid, the lyrics strong, and melodies beautiful. all in all, it's one of those obscure little records that will eventually find its way into your heart and head."
4,Fancy THEY turned into Stereolab!,"McCarthy WAS best known for being on the famous NME C-86 compilation of jangle bands influenced by the likes of the Smiths and the Go-Betweens. Now they are probably best known as being Tim Gane's day job before he went on to stranger things with Stereolab.So here you have singles and album tracks from their brief career (mid 80's to 1990) and on a few you have the presence of Mrs. Stereolab as well, she joined the band after meeting Gane at a concert in 1989.If you're looking for more music in the same vein as Stereolab, you should probably check elsewhere. If however, names like Wedding Present and Close Lobsters make your blood rush and you remember when Primal Scream was still a hippy band (and these are all fond memories, of course) you'll feel right at home with this pleasant late 80's jangle pop.It isn't the Stone Roses, granted, but it isn't half bad either."
1,"drive sucks, service sucks","I bought two of these, they both failed. I sent them in under warrantee. They were returned to me ""reconditioned"" - and still with the same problem."
1,I recommend against this hard drive,"The drive was accidentally disconnected without ejecting it first. My foot hit the plug and the plug pulled out of the socket. The drive is no longer recognized on my iMac with OS 10.4.5. Lacie support said that was the way things were with firewire drives and blamed the situation on the MAC OS. They said all the other manufacturers would have the same problem. I don't buy that logic. Sorry, guys. I can't recommend the purchase of your products."
4,Review,"This was a well researched book on a pvital yet confusing struggle during the 2nd days battle. No was was really in control of this part of the field, just brigades and regiments being intermingled with parts of the 3rd, 2nd and 5th Corps and Sickles trying to take from everyone to cover his blunder. Well wortht he read for someone wanting an in depth understanding of the Wheatfield."
4,Gettysburg's Bloody Wheatfield,This is a very good book. Mr. Jorgensen dedicates the first couple chapters setting up the Confederate side of things i.e. regimental brigade/division assignments and routes of march but does not really do the same for the Union side of things for those regiments engaged in this portion of the battle. Other than that everything else about this book is great. Mr. Jorgensen writes with a clear quick style that moves you through the different phases of this part of the conflict. The maps greatly enhance the book. Anybody who is a student of the Civil War would benefit from reading this book!
2,Raymond Weil watch,The watch was very reasonably priced and apparently arrived in good condition. My only problem was that this was a gift and an invoice was included in the package when I specifically asked that that not happen. I tried emailing the company who shipped this item but never heard back from them. I often buy your products and will continue buying for myself but I'd never again buy a gift for someone else.
4,A wonderful history of a wonderful place,"I think this wonderful book is out of print now, but you should try to get (good quality) used copy of this book. It goes way back in GL history, and shows the old homes that used to, and for some, still do line the shores of this wonderful lake. It starts in Lake Geneva (city) - the largest town on this lake, and walks you counterclockwise around the lake...north shore, west end, and back down the south shore...around 25 miles in all. You read - and see - in wonderful old copies of photos and postcards - about the local and national families and powerbrokers - Fairbanks, Lyttons, Swifts, Harris', Allertons, Sears, etc...who build their wonderful 'summer places' around this wonderful old lake."
1,Don't buy this CD,FYI: this CD has a lock which the record company puts on to prevent you from making a CD-R or transfer to MP3 format.
2,review,"The movie was awesome. I went out and got the soundtrack right away because in the movie they had these awesome techno tracks. They weren't on the cd. The rest of the cd is ok, but what happened to the techno stuff? They should have definitly included the best songs, not the worst."
2,I'm with the rest of ya...,"I have to agree with the other reviewers on this one. The movie was amazing and like everyone else, I was waiting to hear some of the score written by the illustrious B.T. But none of the B.T. songs (or any of the other songs I liked from the movie, for that matter) were on the soundtrack. What happened to Live's mix of their unreleased track ""Deep Enough"" or Dope's song ""Debonaire"" that played during the Swat Team sequence or the Linkin Park track??? I'm almost tempted to go to see the movie again just so I can sit through the credits and copy down the songs track listing..."
3,Not Bad,"Overall this album is pretty good, i have heard most of the songs on a friends copy and they were alright, but a lot of it isnt in the film. In the actual film, there is a face paced action bit (about 65 mins into it) where brian is dressed as part of a police squad going around in big black vans busting loadsa these asian gang people. Does anyone know the song thats being played in the background?"
2,The Fast and the Furious,"This is a decent soundtrack if you like a compilation of various rap tunes, but few of the songs from the movie are actually on the cd. I was hoping to get some of those cool techno songs, like from the house party scene, but I was disappointed to find that none of those the techno songs were on the album. The album contains mainly rap songs that weren't even in the movie! I hope another soundtrack comes out with those ""extra songs"" for those of us who want only the songs that were in the movie....and isn't that the definition of a movie soundtrack?"
2,The song everyone wanted to know....,"This is for the reviewers who wanted to know the song that's playing when Paul and Vin go back to the house after they are chased by the cops. It's ""Nurega"" by Organic Audio. You will find it on their ""Last One Home"" cd."
1,Nothing similar to the film,"I was greatly dissapointed with the soundtrack that came out for this movie. I was expecting something that I could plug into my car stereo and cruise around town. Unfortunately NONE of the techno-sounds were included on the album. What is the purpose to hype up a movie soundtrack with glorious techno and car-screeching noise, when all you get are very slow rap songs. (1 or 2 exceptions)Rather hit the boards and find the songs or just wait until the movies comes out."
1,Not as good as the old ones,I bought my first Scotts handheld about 6 or 7 years ago and used it primarily for spreading salt/ice melt on my driveway. It finally gave out so bought a new one this winter. First time I used it I experienced frequent jamming. Keep in mind I'm not using it for it's intended purpose but to have the old one last several years without any problems while the new one doesn't work from the start adds up to a low rating.
1,Why is everyone saying this is junk?,"Have you noticed that the key word in most reviews for this product is ""JUNK""?Well, you can add another. This piece of junk jammed every time I used it and the handle snapped clear off on the fifth use.Scott's used to be known for top quality. Sadly, that's no longer true.However, you are obvioulsy reading this review because you are looking for a hand-held spreader and the good news is that I found one on Amazon. It's the Earthway 3500 and, so far, I can tell you that it is considerably better than this Scott's piece of junk. I wrote a brief review there. I don't know if Amazon allows links, but if they do, this will take you to the Earthway: [...]If no link appears, just search Earthway 3500 and save your money by NOT buying this inferor Scott's spreader."
3,Pretty good inexpensive shredder.,"It's not very precise, but it'll get the job done spreading fertilizer or seed. The biggest complaint I have is that a full load can be a little heavy to carry around the yard, and turning the plastic crank can wear you out. I have a small to medium sized yard -- about 5,000 sq ft -- I would definetly not recommend for any yard much bigger than mine or if you need a precision fertilizer/seed drop. If I did it again, I might spend a few bucks more and get a push version."
1,Cheap (but expensive) piece of junk,"Like others have reported, this thing is ridiculously cheap. Every part of it is plastic and the first time using it the handle stripped right off the side of the unit. I ended up going back to spreading everything by hand.Even though Scotts may make some higher end spreaders, I will not longer buy any of their stuff. I can't respect a company that is willing to put out such a horribly made product. I wish I could rate this 0 stars."
3,So far so good...,"It has not broken yet. No, it is not strong looking but none of these devices seem to be.For an alternate approach Scotts makes a little 2 pound jug of fertilizer that has a dispenser built it. That thing is permanent, it will never fail. And it is refillable with another lawn product if you wish. So, the other scott's product, the 2 pound jug, doesn't spread quite as nicely as this product being reviewd, but it is unbreakable, and thus my favorite.Soctts 2 pound jug:ASIN: B0032Z39E4The Scotts Co. 29701 Turf Builder With Plus 2 Weed Controlhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Scotts-Co-29701-Builder/dp/B0032Z39E4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1342601171&sr;=8-1&keywords;=b0032z39e4"
3,you can't have it all,"I own a N6260, with rotating screen, and I really wanted to upgrade to N93, which was way way too expensive, thus I reluctantly bought N80 instead.And of course I miss the rotating screen, I find the keypad too small and fiddly, the phone feels small and short in my hand when I talk (not surprising, my other 2 phones being N6260 and N9500 communicator).Besides, keypad glides to open too easy, so your phone unlocks in your bag, makes all sorts of phone calls, makes pictures..how annoying!That sort of NON-THINKING on the side of mobile phone designers! you'd think they started designing the stuff yestarday!And finally, the camera - I find it not so much of an upgrade compared to the other 2 phones I own.Feature I love is real simple transfer of data, including pictures, from other phones, but I believe all Ns have that feature.All in all, XTREMELY UNHAPPY to have paid 700 bucks for it."
4,Excelent Phone,"It's a realy great phone. The menu is simple and intuitive, the configuration is realy simple. The sound is loud an clear, and have a very good reception. The lcd display is really great, bright colours and great image quality. The funcionability is the best, the wifi is realy easy to use and the navigation is realy simple. The camera gets good pictures if the light is good, the same for the video. The voice commands are realy great and simple.In the other hand, the battery life using all the functions is realy short, for just talking it's fine (2 or 3 days) but if you use the music player or the wifi (especially last one) and extra battery is need or have close to you the charger."
5,Truer words have seldom been spoken,"I'm sorry, I had to think of my ex when I first saw this plaque. We're still close friends, and he is a charming and handsome man. But I am nonetheless resentful of the way our relationship ended. Which brings me to this rather strikingly designed piece of, well let's call a spade a spade: art. Basically, it helps very much that my car is a piece of dog-dirt as well. I hope I find another man."
3,"Study of the effect on 5 families of pregnancy,birth &beyond","The book covers the highs and lows which come with a new member of the family. My only negative comment would be that it is perhaps too realistic. It's not that the book is depressing or negative, it is simply truthful, unlike most books relating to pregnancy & parenting which I found to have a definite rosy tint. For anyone wishing to seriously consider the full impact that a baby can have on the family unit, this book gives a great deal of insight. You may not identify with any particular couple, but you will definitely recognise many of the situations which they confront and, more often than not, see your own reactions in an entirely new light. Having said this, it is a fascinating book which delves deeply into the lives of 5 very different American families, covering a wide range of socio-economic situations and showing the full journey - from attempting to conceive, right through to the first birthday."
2,time doesn't help a bad flick to be hip,"this is minus 10 in ""z"" zone with this very poor and dull blaxploitation film . Everything looks cheap , from acting to action parts. Screenplay could have been interesting but stays in the around the main subject without getting really into it . Time doesn't need to be wasted by spending 90 minutes to watch this..."
1,broke,it took 3 days to break. the connection wouldn't line up & i had to hold it weird to use the internet. I bought a linksys wireless usb instead & love it. no more wires!!!
2,Ehh,"After only about a month of using it, it no longer snaps into my computer and falls out a lot when I move my laptop. It is really annoying when I am loading a video and then the cable falls out half way. If you only need to use it for a short time it's a great deal but it's not good for long term use."
5,Just what I needed for a long network run.,"I wanted to hook up my Xbox to a Ethernet cable, but everywhere I looked locally charged 5 times more money then the cable available here. This cable is a genuine Cat5e cable and says so on it. It works flawlessly. Do note that there are many sellers that sell this 25ft Cat5e cable and not all of them produce the same quality. I bought from ""bargain cable"" and am very satisfied."
5,myk64,"needed an ethernet cable for my lg bluray player. run the cable thru the wall into the netgear router, set up the settings on my player and the next thing was streaming video content from netflix, youtube and pandora."
2,ITS NOT BLUE !,"Yes its very long ( maybe 50 feet not 25 ) , yes its a thick cable but its grey not even close to blue . but the color is all wrong"
5,Epic cable.,"I've used some of the best rated cables in my day but this cable is by far the highest quality cable I've ever used. The only thing better than God is this cable, which is why I bought one for me, my wife, kids, and dog. This is a cable of EPIC proportions and is, thus, treated as so in my household. I'd let a stranger borrow my 350z before I let him borrow my ethernet cable. Buy this cable. Don't question me, just do it. Don't need one? I beg to differ."
5,good deal,good price for a twenty-five foot cable seems to work ok so far if I need another cable I'll be checking this place again
2,cheap,"This cable is as cheap in quality as it is in price. As soon as I got it, I went to connect it to the computer and the plastic broke so it doesn't lock into place and I often loose connection to the internet."
1,NOT CAT5E!!!,"This cable may be labelled CAT5E, but it does not actually support Gigabit speeds! It's only capable of 100 Mbps. If you're looking to get Gigabit speeds look elsewhere"
1,Didn't work at all,I recently bought these so that I could have a nice direct connection into my router instead of streaming through wireless and the length was a great plus. The only problem is that I got this and it didn't work.
1,Broke after 6 months,"I purchased this cable on August 31, 2011. As of March 4, 2012, it no longer works. I am disappointed."
5,perfect deal,"perfect deal !!! nice productwith a cool price!!! I do highly recommend !! nothing morw to say ,just go and pick ur item pay it~~"
4,Works great,I used this to hook up the computer to my new 3D TV and DVD so I can get wired internet access for movies and music. It works perfectly fine.
5,25ft Ethernet cable,"This cable came blue as shown in the picture and description.. Thumbs up to that . This cable just clicks in like any other cable and has fast speeds but sometimes can hesitate a little, but I only noticed this on the computer not the ps3. Overall good quality cable."
5,Good material and fast shipping,"I ordered this 25' cable for my son going to college. He found out the last minute that we needed it. First, I thought this was no big deal, just pick it up from local store . . . well yeah, I knew I was wrong when I saw those outrage price. I work in a data communication industry, I know how much a simple LAN cable like this should cost.I then search Amazon and found this cable. Ordering was easy and the price was very reasonable. Better yet, shipping is free. Best of all, delivery was only in 2 days. Quality of the cable is comparable to the store ones and it worked just fine."
3,KEEPS GOOD TIME BUT...,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who uses it every day. The watch seems well made and is quite heavy (that is a good thing). It keeps time well and the red light is a nice feature. After two months, much of the black paint has worn off making the watch look cheap and old. I was disappointed and embarassed to see this since it was a gift."
2,There's no quest in Genesis Quest,"This book is an example of one of the classic ways science fiction can go wrong. Moffitt has come up with a simply splendid premise, but then he didn't trust the fascinating concept to involve readers without help. Instead, the plot degenerates into endless, repetitious bickering between factions of characters, so that the original concept is never developed and the book reads more like a tedious, petty soap opera than a novel. Despite the title, the characters never actually do go on the quest that is discussed endlessly throughout the book. Apparently you have to buy the sequel to read what the cover copy leads you to think you would get in Genesis Quest, but by the time I had slogged through this book I was so bored and annoyed that I never bothered."
5,Why Was It Cancelled,Excellent show - as good as Rescue Me. Wish it would have been renewed for additional seasons.
5,The Job Rocks,"A must have for your Denis Leary Collection. Best show on TV, too bad they took it off."
5,"Smartest, funniest comedy ever on TV","The release of this series onto DVD is a long time in coming. It was a tragedy when ABC pulled it off the air. The casting is superb-the characters are hilarious! There truly has not been a smarter or funnier series before or since. You will laugh until it hurts..the situations put Seinfeld to shame. It is definitely not for the ""PC"" minded-even more reason to watch!"
4,Very cool except for all the lies,"Very entertaining. Disk 4 ""parents"" episode is the best (extremely funny).I loved the whole series except troubled by the moral example it sets by lies after lies (which is not good)."
3,"it's alright, but ""rescue me"" is so much better","this show is all about comedy.. it doesn't ever seem to get serious like ""rescue me"" does. the comedy is decent, but with ""rescue me"" you get better comedy AND drama... and much better characters, too. so in my mind there's not any point in watching ""the job"" unless i want to waste some time and be amused. it's about wacky cops doing silly things. but i won't be laughing hard and revelling in all the plot twists like in ""rescue me."" and this show is basically an earlier version of that show... even some of the same actors are used, and denis leary's character has a drug problem. it all comes across as like an early version of ""rescue me,"" before denis leary really did the whole thing right."
4,We got a thing!,"Great - the mother of all TV-ShowsBecause of questionable picture quality sometimes 4 stars. Quality of content (Actors, Story, etc...) is, without a question, 5 stars!"
5,A slice of life most people will never experience.,"I found this series to be fun, gritty, and lifelike. The characters in the Precinct remind me so much of guys I used to work with on the job. Certainly some artistic license is taken, but for the most part, this is a slice of life which most people will never experience in their day to day jobs. Denis Leary has risen to the top of my list as not only a comedian, but a really talented character actor. His supporting cast fits well, and all in all I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of Rescue Me, or Denis Leary."
1,Horrible,"I gave this show a shot because I'm a big Rescue Me fan. I think Dennis Leary and crew were learning how to act and write during this show, because it was aweful... I barely made it through 2 episodes before I called it quits. This show isn't even close to the quality of Rescue Me, so don't expect it to be."
5,Ya just gotta love denis leary,"If you're a fan of Denis Leary, this is a must for you. The series lasted only a season and a half on ABC. I think that Leary decided to have some extra fun with the show when he found out he was being cancelled. The last few episodes are just outrageous. The DVD set is a steal.bh"
3,Brazilian Brawl,"So bad it's good. Anyway, I'm sure the makers of this film did not have too much of a budget. Editing was pretty bad(choppy)as well as the sound. Fight scenes are okay. I'm just a big fan of the Machado bro's(former student)and also of Dan Inosanto(former student). This movie would've been a hit in the 70's for sure. Thanks for the quick shipping as well. Product was in good shape."
1,Not worth watching,"This is a warning. Do not buy, do not rent, and don't even think of watching this silly excuse of a movie. I've seen martial arts movies with worse plots. But man! I've never seen such terrible acting, and inept fight coreography. This is the worst made movie ever associated with the martial arts. This doesn't deserve a star."
2,Needed more classics... bottom line...,"The original release from VHS ""Saturday Night Live Goes Commercial"" was much better. This seems like ""The best of Will Ferral commercials"". Many greats missing... ""Jewess Jeans"", ""Big Red"", ""Shimmer Floor Wax & Dessert Topping"", ""Velvet Jones"", ""Swill"" and ""Compulsion"" to name a mere few...Glad to see ""Cluckin' Chicken"", ""Happy Fun Ball"", etc. I REALLY wat to find ""Action Cats"". It's nice to have in the collection- no doubt, but there need to be a lot more classics. It's VERY heavy on recent and current casts.Chad Koenig"
2,Not if you're into the 1970's classics.,"Certainly there is room for more than one ""best of"" commercial parody disk from SNL. This one contains a lot of the more recent stuff, but a lot of that stuff is more crass than clever. There is the classic bass-o-matic and the classic car commercial with the circumcision in the back seat, but were is ""Quarry"" cerial, and the triple blade razor (which has since become reality), and ""Tryopenin"" arthritis medication? I know there are others tooOf course, there are the early seasons out in box sets, so I suppose they're on those."
2,It's worth watching once.,Only 20 percent of the shows are funny. I have to fast forward many shows. It's worth watching once.
3,Almost no car ads!,"Where are the car ad parodies?The Adobe; the Lux, a car for schizophrenics; the Chameleon XLE the luxury car that looked like a piece of crap so no one would steal it (the ball bearing rolling down into the engine block is priceless); The Paradox; and the Mercury Mistress, the car you could have sex with.And on a similar note, the 'Infiniti Toilet' ad with Mike Meyers is missing, too.I mean, not all of these are 'Best of...' material but some really are and should've been included."
3,"rent it, don't buy it","I would be disappointed if I had paid any amount for this disc (except for my monthly fee on a certain website for renting movies). I was really happy to see some classics like Hibernol, Colon Blow, the Love toilet, Chia Head, Bass O Matic, Happy Fun Ball, and Buh-weet Sings. I have not watched SNL regularly since the early 90s and the newer stuff was not as funny. I missed commercials like Roseanne working for a bank or something (?), the Viking Guy that whirled blood around and the one about the Adobe car. Would have loved to have seen more Phil Hartman, Kevin Nealon, Dana Carvey and Victoria Jackson. I will likely head over to check out the Phil Hartman collection next, these new kids have nothing on him."
2,Should be called commercials from the 2000s,"I absolutely LOVED SNL Goes Commercial, which aired in the late 80s/early 90s. So, I figured this would be similar, but with DVD quality. Boy, was I wrong. As others have said, the majority of the commercials are from the last 10 years or so. All the brilliant commercials of the 70s and 80s are missing. The ones that are included from that time are not ones that I'd term ""best of."" What a disappointment. I'll stick to my VHS of ""SNL Goes Commercial."""
2,"The best this is not, because so much is missing.","I'm so tired of being conned out of ten or twenty bucks. When I saw what this DVD was titled, I didn't hesitate to get it. I watched it and laughed, but it is far from what it should be. It lacks so many of the truly ""best"" parodies, that titling it in this manner is deceptive. It could, and should have been loaded with so many more of the greats. Until we demand quality, I guess all we'll get is the mediocre."
2,disappointing,"There's some great stuff here and it's nice to have it on DVD.But they left so much great material off. Notably Schmitt's Gay and Big Red. There was no excuse for this especially considering so many of the ads featured in the meager extras section are sub par.Well, at least they are continuing the tradition of releasing half baked SNL best of DVD's. Congratulations Lorne, you did it again."
3,WHER'ES THE ROSEANNE/ PHIL HARTMAN CREDIT CARD PARODY????,"I too had the VHS copy so I was psyched when the DVD version came out. I thought the funniest parody was the one with Roseanne and Phil Hartman. Phil's character loses his credit card and his hotel tells him to call the customer service dept. He gets Roseanne and she's not in a good mood! I howled when I first saw it! I was so disappointed that it's not included in this compilation. Hopefully if there is another volume of commercial parodies, this one will be on it!!!!"
1,"Cord isn't ""extra long""","Let's face it, iPod headphones are basically a commodity. I bought this one because I needed an ""extra long"" cord - like CTA advertised. Even though the specifications on the cord length were not available, I took a chance. And I got hosed. Caveat emptor. I hope I can return it.PS I'm sure the audio quality is fine."
3,Only Volume 1,"This is only volume one of The Poetical Works of Lovell Thomas Beddoes. The ""End of Volume One"" on the final page is the only overt indication. The fact that it does not contain ""Death's Jest Book"" is what first made me realize something was wrong."
5,"A Well-Written, Easy-to-understand Intro","I have an earlier edition of this text that I used in a linguistics course several years ago, and I understand that the 5th edition is very similar.This book is clearly, simply written, making some very complex and abstract concepts clear and understandable. I'm currently working on my Masters in Linguistics, and I regularly refer back to this text in my higher-level classes for clarification of things like Theta roles and x-bar theory (syntax), morphology, phonology, etc.The text is fairly comprehensive, covering all the major sub-categories of linguistics. It doesn't pretend to cover any of the subjects in depth, but it does provide an excellent foundation for anyone who wants to understand the basics."
5,Shadows in bthe dark and things that go bump in the night...,"thats Flooty Hobbs and his pals! They're never anything more and usually much less.The only thing that keeps these guys going is our own faer of the dark,but tonight our bedtime monsters are in for a big suprise.It seems someone has turned the tale on Flooty Hobbes and the gang.Look for an unexpected twist when they are confronted by a Jiggling,Jolly Gollywobber who beats them at their own game.You will enjoy this comical and entertaining story that tells us what we really have to fear when we go to bed...nothing."
2,"some ok songs, but some real garbage too","there are some good songs by MTX, but there are also some absolutely terrible songs by the donnas, and a few others too. the video by pansy division is pretty funny(they didn't mean for it to be like that). but i wouldn't reccomend it too much"
5,Rock art Rocks!,"This book cuts through the clutter of previous rock art meanings and uses the wisdom of the native americans to describe these symbols. I enjoyed reviewing his descriptions of the sites I have already visited and learned the locations of many more. Complete directions, maps, and contacts for each site are included. This is an excellent resource for people who love rock art!"
4,Good selections of events,"Nicely done for students of the history of science, and for students of philosophy. The authors have given us several of the crucial nexus points in the development of modern physics. Now, most students know that you should try to peruse the original papers. But there are practical difficulties. Like if these are written in a language that you cannot read. Or if the language is now totally archaic.So one vital service the authors have performed is to intermediate between us and the source documents. We judiciously get enough of the (translated) source text to hopefully get a feel for the tenor of the debates and the shifting worldviews implicit within these. Supplemented by judicious commentary from the authors."
4,Chemical suit riot,"I wouldn't have ordered this if I knew it had only 4 tracks, but now that it's mine, I'm digging their retro-Devo-80's schtick. Very energetic music filled with synth bleeps, rocking guitars, and powerhouse drums. How can these three kidz make so much noise? (The Devo cover is interesting - subdued with vocoder vocals.) I'd recommend ""Hey Bob My Friend"" before this - it's a better bang fer yer buck!"
5,Wish I had been there!!,"I love concert DVDs, anyway, although they often leave me wishing I had been there. This one certainly does that, in spades. It has it all--first--the greatest pickers; second, great video and audio recording quality, and last, an appreciative and knowledgeable audience. Earl Scruggs finger picking the guitar on ""Who Will Sing For Me"" is not to be missed. Reminds me of those old black and white Flatt and Scruggs TV shows back in the early 60's I used to watch on Sunday night, when Earl would put down his banjo and accompany the group on their ""sacred number"" as Lester put it. If you want to hear more of him doing that, also buy the Flatt & Scruggs CD ""The Complete Mercury Sessions"". Great Stuff."
5,The Best!,"This is the best of the best. True legends of bluegrass. Hearing their stories in their own words is fantastic. A must buy for all those who love the ""old-time"" music. A real gift to be cherished through the ages. This is Americana at its best."
5,The Three Pickers,"'The Three Pickers' DVDThis is an awesome DVD. The narative during the program is very entertaining and informative.Now I know Earl Scruggs, 'Doc' Watson and Ricky Skaggs like long lost cousins.And if you like 'BlueGrass' this is is a dvd you will watch over and over.Even if you are not familar with 'BlueGrass' get this DVD and watch the 'fingers pick'!This music is amazing! And I come from 'Bachman, Turner, Overdrive' and now 'Newsong'!Alison Krauss was so humble and did not 'steal' the show...she is a gem.All the musicians are extremely talented...You'll love this DVD. We do!! Lotus"
5,MY OPINION,"I HAVE THIS CD AND IT IS ONE THAT I AM VERY HAPPY THAT I BROUGHT. FOR ME IF YOU LIKE THIS KIND OF MUSIC IT IS A MUST TO HAVE. DO NOT PASS UP A CHANCE TO OWN A GREAT PEICE OF MUSIC. THE PICKING ON HERE IS AWESOME. DO YOURSELF A HUGE FAVOR AND GET THIS CD. THANKS, TOM"
4,Top Picking,"This is what I wanted, the old stile picking. These gentlemen are very relaxed and they are as good as can be. It is Top performance."
4,The Three Pickers,Excellent concert: Good video representation. I only wish they had not interspersed interview segments in the first three songs.
3,Video didn't work!,The first 20 minutes of the video was great but then it stopped working after that. We need to send it back!
3,Not up to previous very high standard...,"I'm an adult reader and have immensely enjoyed Ms. Watson's series, Jedi Apprentice. I admire the depth and complexity of the characters when these so easily could have been as pure plot-driven shorts for the captive - nearly religious - audience of Star Wars fans (one of whom I am, alas, becoming...).That said, I found this to be the weakest novel in the series (so far). The potentially very interesting new characters were not well-developed, and the relationships of our heroes with them (and each other) are flat. The planetary setting is cliche, but for the intended audience (young adults, pre-teens) that's ok - after all, younger readers probably haven't read 1984 nor Brave New World...Of course, as with all of the previous novels, I read it in one sitting. So it can't be too bad. And I look forward to the next installments. I just hope they are back up to the high standard Ms. Watson set in the earlier novels."
5,the fight for truth,it was good!!!if you ask me. my favroiteperson in it was siri.the vision with thehelmet's wasstorm troopers of course.I liked it.by yoda!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not as good as the preceeding ones,"This comment is one from an older reader. I am getting bored of having nice plots being solved in a matter of three lines. Each book finishes the same way, they say the truth to the people, and everything is fine ever after. Of course, I should not complain as I am well above the age recommended. However I think that lot of readers are like me more interested by the master / padawan interaction, and that is why I am so frustrated. It was good to see our heroes sharing their missions with other jedis, but I wish Jude Watson wrote more about the time Obi Wan and his master have spent together visiting other worlds and making stonger their relation. I think it would be really interesting to find out how they grew up closer..."
5,Finaly,"I have been waiting for Jedi Apprentice #9 for a very long time, and I have to say that this book dosent disapoint. My only complant is that it was to short. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wans realationship felt much more warmer, like a master, padawan realationship should. Though I still wish that Qui-Gon would tell Obi-Wan about some of his thoughts, or maybe some of his VISHIONS! Though the ending was a littal frustrating the book was still a masterpeice and I would give it 10000 stars if I could. Jedi Apprentice #9 had action that almost through me off my seat, and in some parts it was so funny it almost did the same. All the books are so butifuly worded you must read all of them. Please do not pass these butiful books up, if you do you are really missing out."
1,not the same,"Wow, what a disappointment that I received a lovely little bottle of Miss Dior Originale and not the genuine Miss Dior in the black and white checked packaging as pictured. The fragrance is NOT THE SAME. Shipping was fine and professional, but the cost for receiving something I really didn't order was way too high!!"
2,Disliking the NEW Underwear-like Goodnites,"We have used Goodnites for over 2 years with an occasional leak or night time wetting issue. Our latest package is the ""new softer, brief like"" underwear style. What a disappointment! We have had an issue every night since this package has been opened. I'm wondering who they tested these on! My poor little guy is devastated and we are frustrated as we have to get up and change sheets each night....and do the washing all the next day. I can't express my frustration since we had tried other competitor's brands and this was the only one that seemed to work. I will be contacting the company and hope you do the same if you find the same problems we are."
4,Staying dry some nights...,I'm having more luck with a dry bed with these as opposed to any other type. My son is 4 and 43 lbs and wets everynight. Most nights the bed will be dry however they are not perfect. I'm not sure if they could contain a much larger child's flow. I'm sticking with these though as I've had the best luck!
5,Great Product!,The Huggies GoodNites are very absorbent and appear to be comfortable. My son has been wearing these for the last year because pullups were not absorbent enough. Amazon also typically has the best prices especially if you use the Amazon Mom + Subscribe and Save. I would recommend the GoodNites and Amazon to anyone!
1,Not for night time. They Leak.,The goodnites leak. The first night when my three year old child used the goodnites he woke up in the morning with sheets and pajamas soaked. I would not buy them again and I would not recommend them. It might depend on the age of the child. It would have been helpful if the description would have mentioned for ages 4 to 8.
3,"The best we've found, but that's not saying much","Our 8-year-old son still wets the bed, and for the past 3 years we have tried all of the various brands and styles of ""pull ups"" out there (remember to not refer to them as diapers : ) Unfortunately, none of them consistently keep his clothing or bed dry. They might minimize the ""damage,"" but other than providing him a more comfortable sleep, still require us to do daily laundering of his sheets, blankets and more. We also use what we call a ""pee pad"" and mattress cover to protect the mattress. In an attempt to keep things dry, he now wears two of them at a time, and that still accomplishes little more than going through the underpants twice as fast.Pros: comfortable, fit snugly, less embarrassing than diapersCons: doesn't absorb well enough to keep clothing or bedding dry...even doubled up"
5,Pull-Ups Goodnites Night Time Underpants for Boys,"Thank You Amazon, Your subscribe & save order is very convenient for me. I never have to worry about running out of the Underpants for my little one. This feature saves me a lot of time and gas for not have to drive to the stores everytime."
5,Great for tall toddlers!,"My son just turned 3 and not quite ready for the potty. I have been using the GoodNites for awhile now at night time, because he is to tall for size 6 diapers and he would wet through at night time. This product has saved me on changing his bedding everyday! I have them shipped to my house once a month so, I never have to worry about running out."
3,Lack Absorption,"The whole purpose of buying these is so I don't have to wash the bed linens every night. Unfortunately, these don't seem capable of absorbing enough to prevent leakage through the night so I still have to wash the sheets and quilt a couple times a week.Unfortunately, I have not found a competitor in our market."
1,Leak almost every night.,"I have a 4 1/2 year old boy who is 46 pounds. He is just a tad bit too big for size 6 diapers, so we have been using night time ""pull ups."" We have purchased the GoodNites brand twice. When we have used these, they leak almost every night. So, I am still having to change his sheets constantly. The Pampers brand, UnderJams have been the ones we love. They have never leaked. We will be sticking with those!"
2,Doesn't really work,Flat out this item doesn't really work. It really doesn't prevent leakage when there's the occiasional acccident at night. It does hold quite a bit of fluid but not enough to prevent clean up after the fact.
1,doesn't keep the urine in,"My son is 4.5 and has yet to wake up dry from night time. We have been having trouble finding a product that keeps his bedding dry. We had been using regular pull-ups, and night time pull-ups, but they were leaking through to his sheets every night/morning. So, I thought we could try these since they are for older boys.We bought the smallest size, though the packaging says for 38 lbs, and my son is only 34 lbs. I didn't think it would make that big of a difference. Apparently, it does. He leaked out of these worse than he did with the regular pull-up. It was like he didn't even wear ANYTHING to bed. It soaked through his bedding, and his mattress protector, down to his mattress.I'll be contacting Huggies today to see if they have any advice for us on what to do. I may change the rating after I speak with them, since my experience with their customer service in the past has always been stellar."
4,Very comfortable and discrete,"I'm 24 and these diaper are so comfortable to wear, granted I need to do I little stretching before I put them on. I'm just over the weight limit for these and I'm not disappointed by the fit. I'm able to wear them to work/class without anyone noticing. I wish they would make these for adults in a similar style. The ones they have for usual adults arnt as cute and are way to function forward. I can't comment on the absorbtion but I image it being good for all the padding. I would recommend these to anyone who enjoys wearing diapers and meets the physical requirements to wear them."
2,Elvis: From the Beginning,"This is the first documentary that turned out to be a two-fer. The second ""A Generous Heart"" made me want to see the first so I decided to buy it if I could locate it.! LOVE the video but hated the packaging .. there was NONE!! Not even one of the cheesy plastic cases you can buy at Walmart. I should have known that since the price was so low that something would be amiss. Someone oughtta sell them as a set BUT WITH THE DVD CASE!!!!"
4,Drath of A Harbor-Master,"Classic Maigret as he faces a wall of silence in a coastal port.In trying to solve the inexplicable injuries to the Harbor-Master, Maigret is befriended by the denizens of the local tavern - sailors and locksmen - who enjoy his company and tell him nothing, despite the fact that they have most of the pieces of the puzzle."
2,My complaint is different,"I thought that the sound recording was excellent and the musical quality was great. But on some of the pieces, the end of the song was abruptly cut-off. On Voodoo Chile, Crossroads and ""She's Not There"" the end was chopped off, right in the middle of the music. The least they could have done was to fade it out, but the volume was sustained at the chop point. 5 stars for the music and -1 stars for this screw-up, which averages to 2 stars."
4,Great snapshot of where Frank is at right now,"If you dig long jams Frank style then this is your disc. If you like short songs then look elsewhere. My fave is still the black live album from 1978, but this album is very good. I saw Frank on his tour this year and he was fantastic.Rock Guitarists, this and the black live album should be required listening."
5,Simply Staggering Frank!!!!!,"This is absolutely superb. With Frank you know you get top-notch musicianship but this release has absolutely stunning guitar tone and engineering. This is the best Frank has ever sounded!! Both disks just smolder right through their almost eighty minute each playing time!!! What a bargain. Run, don't walk to pick this one up!!!"
4,Real Live,The Only Complaint Was With Mother Nature Who Held Up Delivery Because Of Snow Storms. CD Is Good And Service Was Good.
2,Garbage for sound quality,"As always Mahogany Rush plays great, but whowever did the mixing on this CD should be jailed. The sound quality sucks! The Bass has no drive or power and the highs screech. This person obviously don't know the first thing about fine sound quality and should give it up and go to work at some fast food restaurant. Unless you have a really good EQ on your system to try to tone this CD out, don't waste your money."
3,Too much jamming,"First time I heard him on Live in 77 couldn't stop playing it. He's still one of the best out there and I agree with other reviewers that there should be more people making music the way they want to, not how the record companies want to, but where the older live stuff had songs, this has too much lengthy jamming. There's still some superb stuff here - Voodoo Chile, most of disk 1, but it does go on a bit, especially disk 2!"
2,Didn't work for me,"After reading all of the great reviews on this site, I had to get this. Like many of the reviewers here, I have been listening to many of the great guitarists over the years. Unfortunately I cannot say that this is a recording that I can recommend. Frank Marino does have a high level of technical skills - he can play all of the notes required in the music. He can play with dazzling speed. What I found lacking was emotion. At times, I found the music derivative of Hendrix and Duane Allman but the emotion those players were able to wring from their instruments was not there for me in this recording. Without emotion, the long guitar breaks are not memorable and simply fall flat to me.If you are into Frank Marino, you would probably enjoy this. The sound quality is very good and the song selection covers a range of many years for Marino and MR, so your favorites are probably represented here."
2,get what you pay for,"Guess u do get what u pay for, made cheap ""metal"" feels like u can bend it with ur hand. Hopefully thought works"
2,quiet,"The saw is relative quiet and smooth. My only complaint is that it is , at times , difficult to restart. I wish that I knew how to adjust the carb."
1,junk,"I have a few words that should discribe this chainsaw. JUNK, Chinese Junk, crap, won't start. want to throw away and never buy a McClulloch prodcut ever again."
1,Bad decision to order this McCulloch,"I ordered the McCulloch Mcc1635A 16 inch chain saw because McCulloch was at one time a great product, but I was unable to start it even one time. Called in to find out where I could take it and took it into the autorized dealer and was informed that it was an older model and they could not find the part needed. Now what do I do with this saw, as this is an item that cannot be returned to Amazon?????????????????????? Help is needed."
1,Waste of money,"McCulloch chain saws are trash! They use fuel lines that harden and break in no time. They are impossible to adjust the carburetor, they will not run consistently."
4,nice little saw,"replaced a 20 year old version from McCulloch that had been great - hope to get half that use out of this one. not great for heavy work, but perfect for the occasional tree or pickup load of firewood..."
3,CAVEAT EMPTOR,"""CAVEAT EMPTOR"" ""BUYER BEWARE"". I truly like this new saw. Trouble is it wouldn't run right out of the box. I called the Company 800 number and was told to take it to their authorized dealer. Which I did. After a $35 service charge it runs and cuts great. The dealer told me that if I had bought it from him in the first place, there would have been an under-warranty ""no charge"". This will be the last time I buy anything mechanical online.Al Latimer"
2,These chain saws have always been hard to start.,I've had 1 in my life time. From word of mouth. Even my repair guy has told me not to buy them. Its not because there cheaply built. The most expensive ones have cheap part. It all in the carb & engine. There now coming from China the engines. Poorly built. This is what we get.
1,NO BOX,"No box, no seal? seriously? Do NOT buy from this person. I am giving this as a gift & am finding it a little difficult to explain this.."
5,Interesting and Inspiring,This was a lovely book to read - inspiring yet telling well the hardships and cruelty that were inflicted upon a whole race of people by this country. The sender of this book was very responsive and thoughtful and personal in this transaction.
3,In my bedroom,"I give this book three stars .This is the frist novel I read by Donna Hill and I have to say it's an good read , however the story line is depressing to me .Because the book was well written am going to read another book before I form an opinion about Donna."
4,I hate beauty shops!,"How I hate beauty shops! I cannot afford high end prices and do not care for hands-on care at all.[unlike a friend who goes every week].This book is perfect with easy to understand directions and diagrams, who cares if the pictures are just rough sketches.With a good pair of sheers and a comb to measure with I can finally do something with this curly head, and a little help to tidy a stray neckline from a friend. Thank you, thank you!"
4,Great for beginners,"This book is very simple to understand. It gives the 'basics' then goes on, with simple illustrations, to different ways to cut bangs. From there it goes through a couple of simple cuts step by step."
2,This book is not the first step to take,"As I said in another review, learning a skill from a book alone is extremely difficult. But good ones will at least give you a taste and somewhat of a foundation to explore further. This book is not terrible, but I would not recommend it as the first one. The drawings all look the same and they are very dated hair styles. The text is clear, but somewhat different than the information in another book (Handel's ""Cutting Your Family's Hair""), so it can get confusing. A better book would need photos of every step and more detailed info. If, after studying other how-tos and practicing for a bit, then this book might give you another angle to ponder, but I would say use it only as an additional reference, rather than a sole resource."
3,"How to BASICALLY cut hair (not ""simply"")","I was excited to get this book. But after reading it, I'm a little disappointed. In a few instances, I found more explanation was needed. No matter how many times I read over certain parts, I still don't get what she's saying. I get the general idea of her point of view, and I feel I could do an okay job cutting my son's hair. But I'm not prepared to tackle my husband's head. I'm looking into videos that can give me more info. This book is VERY basic, AND dated. (But it's difficult to find a book on hair-cutting that's NOT dated.) It doesn't even teach how to cut hair so it has a natural flip, which is very common these days."
4,students helping each other,"i sent the book to my granddaughter in europe, she is an exchange student. hair cuts are very expensive so they wanted to learn the basics of hair cutting so they can help each other save on the expence. i hope it works"
4,A True Soul Sister,"Die-hard, old school, soul fans, whoknow the voice of Dee Dee Warwick,know that she is a bona fide member ofthe Warwick-Houston clan of soulfuldivas. Her Grammy-nominated, R&B; topten hit, the blistering ""Foolish Fool,"" isjust one example of soul music at its most soulful.Dionne Warwick has said thather baby sister is ""the singer in thisfamily,"" and she may be right! That'squite a compliment considering thisfamily not only includes Dionne, butCissy and Whitney Houston!"
1,Poor instructions & no pictures,Poor instructions & no picturesSometimes when I put something together if there is poor instructions the illustrations can insure that things are done as intended.There was not proper instructions or illustrations to do so.
4,Are You Being Served? Collection 2 (series 6-10),"The service was prompt. The coupon deal was unbeatable. This is a gift, so the quality of the DVD has not been tested; however, I'm sure it is excellent."
4,Good even with the updates in the cast ...,"Although this later set includes updates to the cast which weren't always up to snuff as the originals, I still enjoy these shows and I think you will too. So, ""are you free"" for some great entertainment?"
5,Recommendable,"Fine Iggy Pop tribute album. Well known Iggy Pop songs recorded by excellent punk bands. The bands originate from UK, USA, Finland, Japan, France and Australia. Included are three versions of ""No Fun"" as well as two versions of ""Search And Destroy"" and of ""I Wanna Be Your Dog""."
2,Get T o The Point!!!!!!,"This book is not very exciting. The main character, Angelica Chapee has six days to lose her virginity in order to inherit the money that her grandfather has left her since he has recently passed away. The funny thing is that Angelica's grandfather just happens to be rich. This leaves Angelica surprised being that she never knew her grandfather was a millionaire.This book is extremely boring with no surprises or action at all. It lingers with the fact of Angelica losing her virginity within six days. I don't like how the author stays on the same topic, meanwhile taking forever to get to the point! This makes me not want to continue reading the book. Although I am still reading the book and also hoping there will be some action somewhere throughout it. My opinion is that if you want to read a romance, don't read this one. It will only be a waste of your time!!!!!!!"
2,Potential,"It's a little too convenient that she just happens to have all these sexy shoes & dresses, being under her grandfather's watchful eye. Jeanette never shared how she lost her virginity. Juan became REAL corny over Angelica but female writers have the WORST habit of doing that (the main reason why I only read male authors' books). Eavesdrop on a man's conversation if you're going to attempt to talk from his perspective. But this author can entertain me because the part about Marcus was the best part of the story! I wish the author would write a story about Marcus!"
2,Want Some Love Get Some Love,I'm not really sure how much I like this book right now. The story about Angelicas life is pretty boring as of now and sort of forcing. Angelica lost her grandparents the two important people in her life that she has been with for a while. Apparently her loving grandfather was a very wealthy man and had a lot of money. The sick part is in order to get the money they want her to go to a family doctor to prove that she isn't a virgin anymore at the age of twenty one but Angelica is one of the most innocent characters I have ever read about. She also has only six days to prove this. Reading about theses six days is like reading about six years. Its like nothing is going on right now in the book and I am on page approximately 120 and it's really boring.
3,Whatever!!!,"I am going to have to tell you this straight....no chaser!!!Angelica Chappee's grandfather past away and left her everything that he owned, which included 3 funeral homes. The stipulation for her to get this inheritance was for her to lose her virginity in 6 days. Well needless to say she meets this guy named Juan from the Bronx at like the very end of the book, which took a star away from the book.Angelica never lost her virginity, but got the money anyway because her grandfather said in a viewing of his last will and testament that she followed her heart. Alright that's all well and good, but check this out, me myself I would have been losing that virginity to get that paper and with that I would have been following my heart and I pretty sure you would too.There are some other twist and turns in the book, but I will leave that up to you to find out if you chose to read that book.Later!!!"
3,GET REAL!!!,"This book was cute...and that's it. The book has 2 main characters, Angelica and Juan who don't even meet until the very end! The author spends a lot of time on each character individually which makes you think that Juan is the answer to Angelica's prayers...but he turns out to be just another man. Yes she likes him but there is really nothing special that happens between them that made me like the book. Sure this book is funny at times, but it's pretty predictable. You know that her grandfather doesn't REALLY want her to lose her virginity so you know that there is a lesson to be learned. The end of the book leaves you hanging...Yea she tied all the characters together in the end but I wanted to know more. Let somone tell you about the book and read something else. It's a cute story but GET REAL!!"
1,new writer,"A typical book on writing, with little information on trade magazines, and a lot of white on the pages."
1,Not DVD-A,The box contains a normal dvd and a cd. The product description suggests this is a DVD-A.DVD-A is a high resolution audio format. The product description is wrong.
4,A MUST READ for anyone concerned by use of The Bomb in WWII,"This is a great book for anyone who has ever questioned America's use of the atomic bomb to end World War II. It not only includes an introduction from Paul Tibbets, Pilot of the Enola Gay, but material from one of this country's surviving recipients of the Medal of Honor. The coverage on Japanese attrocities in Nan King was horrifying...the death stats from battles in the Pacific were also startling...this book proves that the Atomic bomb saved more lives than it took."
4,Great songs!,"This is a very good Scooby Doo story, with really good songs. And the Mexican characters are voiced by alot of Spanish-speaking actors."
3,RENT THIS MOVIE,I love scooby so a wise word of advice: RENT THIS MOVIE. You will fall in love with it for a while and then never watch it again. I still love this movie but i can tell that most people would get bored after a little.
4,Scooby Doo Flies High,"Kids loved this one. Catchy music, lovely Mexican setting, several character who seem ""suspicious"" when scary things start happening. The flying statues scene from the ruins kind of confused my kids, but added to the mystery - did the statues really come to life or was it another trick? (the mystery is solved in the end) Scooby Doo and his crew have endured since my childhood and their newer movies are still entertaining for kids today."
1,Never got it,"I never received this item! I had to rate this so I gave it a 1 star, but it wasn't worth that."
3,another box set that is incomplete,Curtis Mayfield is the greatest...no doubt about that. But this box set doesn't include one of his best songs...Little Child Running Wild. Make sure and buy the Superfly album so you can get one of his top 5 tracks of all time. It's an insult to have a Curtis Mayfield box set and not have this song. Otherwise cough up the loot and get this.
5,A five star thriller about the Gulf War,"This is truly the best book I have ever read. It is mainly based on interviews, so you know what it felt like to be in the pilot's situation. It covers everything, including facts that just a short time ago were strictly confidential. In other words, this book ""Swears to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth"". When reading this book I became attached to the brave pilots, WSOs, and commanders. They stuck by each other in the good times and the bad times, combined good teamwork with talent of flying, and finally overpowered the Soviets until they were forced to surrender."
1,Remedial English,"As a fan of military flight sims, I looked forward to reading this book in order to enrich my understanding of modern aerial combat with the F-15E. Unfortunately, the author's ponderous, wooden narrative and puerile dialog dampened my initial enthusiasim. Though the book is filled with interesting anecdotes and insights that only a person who was actually there would know, they are squandered since the author's command of English is at the level of a grade schooler. I had to stop after only 2 chapters since I couldn't bear it, it was like being forced to watch Sesame Street. I didn't expect the Great American Novel, but the writing here was absymally poor."
5,Great book!,"This is an unbelievably enjoying book. It really shows that the fighter pilot role is not easy. An excellent supplement to this book is the combat sim Janes F-15. As you can gain the terminology that will translate both ways. Also you will understand the F-15E's complicated radar, and the load put on the pilots"
4,Great memoir about one of the greatest jet fighters in the history!,"There isn't much more to say other than:The book is written in a very simple yet informative language even for an average person. However if you are a military aviation enthusiast, and want to read about what those guys went through and did back then as well as the environment they were in, then you will be pleasantly surprised by this book. I personally enjoyed it very much."
1,won't ever stay sealed,"I have tried and tried with this canister... and it'll seal and stay sealed for a week at most, then loses its seal. Quite frustrating. A waste of my money."
1,I don;t care for foul language,"Any music with swearing in it, will not get a good rating from me. I will never listen to it."
3,Limited uses...,"This piece has limited uses due to the small size. It's not easily used as an appetizer plate, it seems better suited for individual portions of a side dish. The quality is the same as all other Pfaltzgraff and it is nice that it brings in a lot more of the blue when placed on the table with all of the place settings."
2,"Cute, but...","Very small and chips easily. Not too many uses other than maybe putting a few olives or a bit of chutney in these. Pretty, but not very useful. Mine are going in the yard sale."
2,Really too small for anything,"Bought these at a discount store and glad I did.They are cute, match the Napoli pattern, but are toosmall for appetizers or side dishes. Maybe OK forsauces or dressings on the side, but that's about it."
1,swiss diamond cookware,"I have been very happy in the past with my Swiss Diamond cookware. I recently purchased a cook pot and am very disappointed in the quality. Swiss Diamond is expensive, but has been worth it before. Within a week it was scratched, even though I was careful with it, within another week, multiple spots of erosion appeared. What has happened to their quality control? My daughter bought their cookware at the same time, and hers is now peeling."
2,quite a few scratches only after a couple of weeks,Have to return it today because of quite few scratches on the surface. Only used for a couple of weeks.
3,KARMA CURMUDGEON,"The more one reads Paul Johnson, the less enchanted one gets. I started with his INTELLECTUALS, which I think is his best book. Then I went for MODERN TIMES, which is a must. His HISTORY series (Jews, Christianity, the USA) are OK, but they often shift from knowledge to mere opinion, while his recent HEROES falls flat from the start. My last reading was TO HELL WITH PICASSO, and that marked my farewell with the doctor: what a load of conceited cantankerous bile!As for this collection, what can I tell you? If you're looking for ""wit and wisdom"", start elsewhere. Benjamin Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, G.K. Chesterton, Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein, H.L.Mencken, Harry S. Truman ...clearly, he is not. Wisdom, he has; wit, he lacks; satire, he tries. Still, no match for these Olympians. Sorry."
3,"so-so, so far","while this isn't the best Radclyffe work that i've read, it still entertained me. i have a feeling that i won't be able to accurately judge this novel on it's own, but rather on how it complements the others in the series. so far, i'm not too impressed, but i have ordered the second and third books, mostly because i'm curious about what happens next with Cameron and Blair."
4,Very Readable - Full of complex characters,"I never want to stop reading this author's works once I start. I loved the character Cameron, she is an original like none other in fiction - we need more people like her. For me, Blair was a little harder to love but I am glad I continued to read because by the second book in this series 'Honor Bound' I wouldn't want her any other way. The setting in Manhattan was fun to read. This was well written and a perfect book for a long lazy afternoon.This is a Keeper !Don't miss the other novels in the series -Above All, HonorHonor BoundLove & HonorHonor GuardsHonor Reclaimed"
4,A great start to a great series,"This book is the first in a series and is great for action minded reader but I think lesbian readers will of course get the most out of it. Not as steamy as the books that follow, but really good start. There is enough 'real' stuff in reference to secret service activity to help frame the book too. It was hard to put down. I found myself ordering the rest of the series before I was finished so they would be ready the minute I did."
1,Extremely Biased!,"I found myself unable to even stomach this book beyond the 25th page. The impression I got was that if you were a Catholic, or a Mormon, a Jew or a Muslim or anything other than a fundamentalist Christian who had to be preached hellfire and brimstone to every Sunday, you were in the wrong and disillusioned. No matter what you thought you thought, you were as Frankenstein, blaming the world for your badness, not as Dr. Jekyll who recognized his badness and desired to be separated from it."
5,This Book is Great!!!!!!!,"Hi! My name is Hannah (don't be fooled by the name they put in here...it's my mom's), and I am from Texas. I am a teenager, and I am reading this book for a school assignment (the author, Mr. B, is my Humanities teacher). I am writing this assignment to say not only is it an awesome book, but it is readable for people my age. It is a great book because it is so well researched and supported, and he makes everything quite clear for everyone. Buy it -- it is a great introduction to worldviews. I understand Christianity a lot more now, and I know exactly how my new age flute teacher is incorrect in her beliefs. Thanks for writing such a great book, Mr. B -- I hope everyone gets a chance to read it!!!"
5,Encouraging,"This was an excellent book. I had originally chose this book because I knew it was going to cover some of the ""worldviews"" that are out there and I wanted to keep up-to-date. This book offered much more than that. J.F. Baldwin has a easy to understand writing technique. I've grown closer to the Lord after reading this book and was encouraged to share what I learned/or was reminded about with my children. He stresses the importance of putting 100% of our trust in God and not in man. This is a book I'll read once a year as a reminder that I am a child of God and there is nothing that he can't do."
3,"Nothing new, somewhat pro Manson","I am very interested in Manson and the Family but this book was mostly just another book on the ramblings of Manson. I didnt find out anything new. There were alot of drawings of Manson and cartoons that were somewhat interesting but I expected more. Still it is a must have for a collector of Manson books, can be hard to find."
5,Excellent book.,This book is truthful unlike the other half assed books out there. This was well done and much truth was told in this book.
4,Good Stuff,Kills germs and helps keep my teeth clean and my mouth fresh. Does the job. Good stuff. Free shipping for Prime members like me too.
3,"Article is from 2001, not 2005.","I ordered this journal because I am writing a paper on physician assisted suicide. I can't use articles older than 2005 and downloaded this artricle because the product details show it was published in 2005. After the download, I found that the published date was August 1, 2001. The product information should be updated to reflect the actual published date of this article."
5,A must for anyone who sees patients with endocrinopathies.,The beauty of this reference book is that it offers pithy reviews of common endocrine disorders with a streamlined focus on diagnosis and treatment. It tells you what to know in 10-20 page chapters with excellent use of diagrams and tables. What is especially nice is that areas of controversy are addressed by the authors who then interject their own treatment strategies based on years of experience and background information. I can't wait for the next addition.
3,Not like WDW waffles at all,"Newly returned from my first visit to WDW (Port Orleans French Quarter), I had a hankering for waffles similar to the ones that they make there. I bought the Villaware maker, since the pictures looked quite similar. However, the shape on the product I received is nowhere near as deep as the pictures show, and the middle is thicker, so the result is more like a Mickey-head shaped pancake - the texture is nothing like a nice *crisp* waffle."
4,Mickey Wafflemaker,Acquired this item as a Christmas gift and the recipient was very pleased with it. The wafflemaker works fine and makes a waffle that is just the right size for a child or anyone for that matter. wished that it had a little more detail but that is a small matter if the finished product is good eating.
1,Very Disappointed,"For my birthday my daughter gave me a Villaware Mickey Waffler. The waffler was intended to replace our well used Vitantonio Model 1950 Mickey waffler. Our family grew up with that waffler and used it for many years.The Villaware waffler is quite a disappointment. The issue is not its operation. The issue is the image of Mickey that is formed in the waffle. The image is very shallow, resulting in a waffle that doesn't even look like a waffle. My daughter had one of the waffles, and even she was disappointed with the waffler. I had previously hesitated to return it because it was a gift from her. It has now been returned."
1,mickey mouse pancaker,"This is advertised as a waffle maker, but it is not. There is not a ridge or waffle involved. It is a pancake form of Mickey Mouse. The old version which was discontinued was a waffler, and photo they use shows the waffle that the previous item produced. The new Mickey Mouse Waffler would not show up well since there is no depth to the facial features, and there is only a hint of an outline of the face of Mickey Mouse.If you truly want a waffle maker this is not one."
3,VillaWare V5555-01 Mickey Mouse Waffler,Bought this as a Christmas present for my third cousins. You'll have to ask them !!
4,"Wonderful, but....","I am a great admirer of Ms. Lively's work, both fiction and nonfiction, and I think this is a wonderful book. My only disappointment is that there are no photographs in the book--not even an author photo on the jacket cover! Photographs would have raised the book's price, I suppose, and it might seem childish to request them, but when there is such detailed and vivid description of specific objects (that embroidered firescreen, for instance) and people, I don't believe it is unreasonable for the reader to want even more--and to feel a bit cheated. Was it her decision, or a stingy move on the part of her publisher?Still, I love this book and plan to re-read it many times."
4,Descriptive yet archaic,"Lively does a great job of linking her ancestry and past to the physical structure and contents of the family's country home. Great detail and description of another time, but it becomes a bit ponderous. I raced through the first half of the book, and plodded through the last quarter."
4,Simple Retelling For Young Readers,"This is a retelling of the new Care Bears feature ""Journey to Joke-A-Lot"" for young readers. The plot is distilled to its most basic elements, with all references to the villain plot and the more complex elements of the story removed.The basic plot is that after an accident, Funshine Bear and Grumpy Bear have a disagreement when Grumpy feels that Funshine doesn't take anything seriously. Funshine is worried by this pronouncement and decides to leave Care-A-Lot for someplace where he can crack jokes without hurting anyone's feelings. He ends up becoming King of Joke-A-Lot, but his friends all miss him and want him back.This will probably be a good read for any young kid who is just starting to read. The illustrations are also nicely done and well worth looking at."
4,Great Season!,Another season of a great show! This is one that my family and friends love to watch and re-watch. The price on Amazon was cheaper than stores and shipping was pretty fast.
5,Perfect.,The DVD was brand new and my boyfriend loved his gift that I got him. It came in great time too!
5,Big bang theory.,What can i say.. Big bang is just a good show. I am going through the seasons to finish 1 through current.
5,best on TV,I love the show and gave this to my son for Christmas. This is the best comedy on TV right now/
1,Amozon Vidio streaming - terrible,love Big Bang Theory. Hate Amazon on line. This system leave something to be desired. If you watch before 9:00pm you might be able to watch an entire episode without it stopping and reloading.
3,Some scratches,Didn't play at one point. Was a bit disappointed with that but overall a nice gift for Xmas this year.
5,Love the show and so glad I can get it streaming!,Really the title says it all. I've loved the show since I was first introduced to it years ago and it's been a pain in the neck trying to find it anywhere streaming so I'm really happy that I could find it here and in such great quality too.
4,3 seasons and still a good show,"I'm looking forward to getting the 3rd season on DVD. There still are some interesting places for the characters to go, so I'm curious as to how the writers will handle this. The series finale hinted at a possible romantic relationship for Sheldon, which should be interesting in several dimensions.Now I think the writers need to give Penny more to do- we know she's from Nebraska and has a brother, but beyond that there's not much background. What's her last name? We've seen (or heard) the other characters' parents- what are Penny's parents like? It would be fun to see Penny finally get some modeling or acting work. If I were one of the show's writers, I would put together an episode or two where Penny gets a bit part in a low budget sci-fi movie, and the guys overwhelm her with suggestions on costume and lines and keeping the science real.Anyway, TBBT is one of my favorite shows, and I'm hoping for a great 4th season."
2,"New characters, leaving the core humor","This season was dramatically less enjoyable for us. I am surprised the other reviewers are not mentioning that the new characters did not add new angles to the story... instead, they simply pushed out some of the other characters more and expanded the story cast so much that the core four people simply are not together in one scene nearly as much as the earlier seasons. When they are together, the show rocks. It seems as though they took the best part of the show and cast it aside."
4,The characters grow on you,"This show is pretty funny, even though a bit silly and predictable. After working all day in a burnout job, it is fun to come home and watch. But appreciation in the show was increased as they finished out the season with some great writing; maybe even funnier than the first couple of seasons. I am looking forward to catching these, I just have it set for recording right now. I got to like this show by the end of the first episode. For a couple of years I never missed an show since I am recording them except for the season I purchased, where i missed a few of them. I wasnt too impressed at the beginning of the third year but then it got better."
5,Very Funny TV Show,DVD arrived 3 days after release (I had pre-ordered it) with free shipping. Five stars to Amazon and to the show.
5,Big Bang Rocks!,"I love the series and this season is wonderful. My favorite is definitely Sheldon, we cannot get enough of him!"
5,3 Season,"Bought for a gift, the person loves Big Bang Theory, so this was a huge hit when they opened the box!"
5,3rd time's the charm?,"not sure but Big Bang will always deliver the goods! And so will Walowitz:) You can't help but want to be their friend and have their intelligence for that matter! The show's humor will not disappoint! Also, when will Kuthropalie ever talk to a girl without drinking?! Keep watching....and hoping!"
4,TBBT Season 3 was a lot of fun on DVD,"Explore the rise and fall of Penny and Leonard's romance, the evil of Wil Wheaton, and the beginning of the infamous Amy Farrah Fowler experiment. It's all here in widescreen format. No commercials, and some cute features. Hilarious moments as the boys lose a bet and dress as female superheroes, and Raj finally gets laid. Season 3 of TBBT has found its rhythm and voice. It's well done."
5,Geeks RULE!,"we're into our 1st disc of the 3rd season - after watching season 1 & 2. these guys are so funny! and we love penny. ""BAZINGA"", 'ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR, LIZARD, & SPOCK! how original is that!? every episode is so hilarious ... can't wait to finish season 3. just love watching the seasons on dvds - need not have to put up with the commercials! this show has to be the best tv comedy so far. sheldon, leonard, howard and raj are the best TV geeks! and also we just love ALL the t-shirts that sheldon is wearing! wonder where we could get them?"
5,Wonderful,"The big bang theory, is a comedy, that everyone will love. the show always comes in clear and Amazon makes it easy accessible."
1,Don't believe the hype.,"To CBS: Turn down the laugh track, I'd like to (1) hear the jokes, and (2) laugh on my own. For a show that many seem to think is so smart, I'm surprised to find this to be the case."
5,Great,"This season really delivers the laughs, i love every second. You get just as much enjoyment the first time watching as you do the tenth time"
5,HILARIOUS!!!!,"What else can I say about The Big Bang Theory. Superb writing and superb acting. This is a very funny show. I have all 4 seasons on DVD and anxiously await the release of Season 5. I can't get enough of these ""geeks."" An then there is Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco. The show wouldn't be the same without this very talented and very very pretty woman. And then of course there's Sheldon. I have one word for Sheldon...BAZINGA!"
4,The episodes from seaon three appear to be edited.,"I love TBBT - finally a TV show I can relate to, Sheldon reminds me of me - minus the scientific genius part - my one complaint is that they don't appear to be the full episodes as advertised - they appear to be the edited Syndicated versions of the show - for example, in the season finale of season three, when Howard and Raj are signing up Sheldon for the dating service, in the original episode there is a scene of them filling out the application form by answering the questions a Sheldon would, which was funny, but it wasn't in the syndicated episode and it's not on the DVD, plus all the episodes seem shorter than than they should be. For all the money they charge for the DVD sets - Couldn't CBS at least provide the full, uncut episodes of the show? - I have to wonder what Sheldon would say about this."
5,I got it in great condition.,"The merchandise that I purchased from this customer was new like it was supposed to be, and the DVDs play just fine."
5,AWESOME!,We had been looking all over for the 3rd season and hadn't found it until I looked here...It was delivered quicker than estimated and we have been watching it over and over ever since...I can't wait for season 4 to come out on video...We will definitely be buying that one here too!
5,LOVE THIS SHOW,This has to be one of the best shows ever. I now own all three seasons and plan to purchase all future ones.
1,BAD DVD,"I purchased The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Third Season. Out of the 3 disks, the first 2 were so damaged that they would not play. I was appalled that somebody would sell crap like that and call it ""good"" condition. I chosed to throw it away rather than return it so it wouldn't get sold again."
2,I just had a dream...,"I just had a dream that they could release an alternative version of this season without that obnoxious, agressive, intrusive laughing track. Never, I mean never, I's seen a sitcom use a laughing track in this way. But, by judging the great reviews and ratings, the producers coul not care less with my opinion.I mean, the jokes are great by themselves. You don't need to add a histerically high laughing track each time Sheldon says ""Hello"", or when he knocks on the door repeating the name of the occupant. There's simple no need for it, other than the old psychological cliche that people tend be more open to laughter when people around them are laughing."
3,Doesn't play on my Mac,"I was really looking forward to this one as I LOVE season 1+2. But my 2008 Macbook with a GSA-10N DVD drive wouldn't play the DVD, even though it's set to region 1 (US) and I confirmed this setting. My other Mac (a 2006 iMac) has no problem whatsoever with the disk, but Macbook users should be warned problems might occur."
4,Hilarious,Power to the Nerds! This 3rd Season is very funny. You can watch it without bearing the commercials and there's a couple of interesting behind scenes that shows us the almost normal human aspect of the actors...
5,Hope this show never dies,"I can't get enough of this show. It's witty, informative, hilarious, and flat out fun to watch. The evolution of the characters was fun to watch, and by the 3rd season they have really settled on who these characters are. You will enjoy this show."
2,Old info in my copy,"From the reviews, I thought they had updated this book. They did not. It still has all of the old insulation info. For seven bucks, it's not worth sending back, and some of the other information in it is useful. The electrical planning info, for instance."
1,"Outdated, NOT updated","No basement, but this book is full of old outdated information. It should not be linked to the newer edition. This creates a recepe for mold."
1,Remodeling a Basement,Did not receive it as yet still waiting for it. Dissappointed that they never said it was unavailable at this time. Looking to replace it if they would send something else comparable in its place.
2,not that helpful for basement issues,"This book covers, in great depth, basic framing and finishing techniques. In other words, it's full of information that's available in myriad other remodeling texts. That information is well presented, but it's nothing exclusive to this book. What I expected, and where it falls woefully short, is a good discussion of issues particular to basements. Water gets perhaps two pages, humidity/moisture nothing at all, slanting floors and floor drains nothing. He does mention egress windows and basement mechanicals. Overall, however, far too much space given to general building techniques (probably over 80% of the book), when in fact what I think is needed is a lot more depth and detail regarding issues related to basements."
3,Remodeling Book,"This book was just OK for me. Not as simple as I would have like for ""Do it yourself"" folks. Its great if you already have the required skills!"
4,Good Reference,I think that this book is a good reference but certainly doesn't have everything you need to know. It is however a good reference for anyone wanting some ideas on how to remodel a basement.
5,Good starting point for novice DIYer,"Good book that touches all aspects of a basement finishing job. Good starting point for any novice DIYer. Author was also featured on Handyguys podcast, episodes 21 and 22, which will give you more of a background of the author."
4,good starter,"this book does most of what it should. most of the explanations were understandable and dealt with my situation. some of them were confusing or outdated. for the most part, this is a good starter for someone, who, like myself, has never finished a basement before but has some around the house experience. i'm now putting the finishing touches on my basement and although i had to pick up some specific books on tiling and electrical, this book helped me get started."
4,Very Good Book,"I have read this book a few times already. It is very good for ideas and a general overview of what can be used in a remodeled basement, but not a ""how to"" book by any means. You better know how before reading this book, because you won't know how after. You might just have a few good ideas about how you want it to look, carpet of title, etc... Over all I found it useful."
4,Good Tips,The book provided me the information I was looking for and gave me ideas and suggestions that I hadn't thought of for the basement. Good job.
5,Basement Remodeling Step-By-Step,"Great book, very easy to read and follow. Answered almost all my questions along the way. If you are considering finishing your basement, I highly encourage you to buy this book."
4,Remodeling a Basement,"So far, so good. This book seems to have all the details to get started on that home project. I've only done the framing so far, but it's really good in showing you how to do it, not only with words, but very detailed pictures and step by step instructions. I would recommend this book if you decide to remodel a basement and tackle all or part of it yourself."
5,Great DIY book!,"I was able to finish my basement with the help of this book. It covered most of what is needed for the entire project. Some of the different steps are not as detailed as they could be, but I found other books to pick up the slack (Black and Decker Complete Guide to Home Wiring is a must). Overall the book was a great kick start to planning and getting started as well as guiding you through the different phases of the project. Must have book if you are thinking about finishing/remodeling your basement."
3,"dull. Too much theory, not enough specifics","There is great detail spent on how to put silicone in a crack in block cement, however a nice page of dimensions for doors, clearances to adjust for carpet, and advanced framing is just glossed over.Too much about the basics of every part, not enough for what i was looking for (really more or less suggestions on how close to put lights, and dimensions for framing, and tips for drywall hanging)."
4,Helpful Book For Planning Out A Basement Project,"I'm preparing to begin work on finishing our unfinished basement and while this book is great at a project management level, it doesn't go quite deep enough in detail on some topics as much as I would like. It's almost there, just not quite. I realize that was not the intent of the author, as there are rows and rows of books focused on specific projects such as framing, electrical, etc. But if it had given a bit more detail for the various topics covered, it would have been perfect.In any case, it is an excellent value for the price. This is the first basement I have owned and it's going to be a large project. This book has helped me determine which portions of the project I will contract out to professionals."
4,A good start,"If you have heard the term ""Jack of all trades - Master of none"" you have summed up this book. It is a great starting point to get answers to your basement finishing project but is not complete enough to be your only assistance because it lacks some of the important details you will need to know as you progress. I learned a lot from this book and would suggest it to all but the most experienced remodelers."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED!!!!,"I want to give this no stars because Ritz Camera - SHAME ON YOU! This is not the item that is listed....this is NOT A MAGNETIC page, but a regular scrap book page without the plastic cover. Also, buyer beware because no where on the shipping policy does it state that if they mislead you into buying the wrong thing that you still HAVE TO PAY THE SHIPPING, but it is stated in big, bold letters on the return form!!! I am now going to fight my shipping charge on my credit card with my credit card company because had I wanted regular scrap book pages, I can find them anywhere without having to pay shipping. I came online because I thought this is where I could find magnetic ones!"
1,Put me to sleep....,"I was surprised at how boring and non-scary this was. They move into a former funeral home..........of course, embalming equipment all over the basement is a little creepy. The kids want to sleep with the light on. so what? lots of kids do. The parents (especially the mother) are already predisposed to believing something creepy is happening (even though the narrator tries to tell us the opposite). It was the parents' thirst for a really big house that made them choose a former funeral home over something more modest, then they decide not to tell the kids about it. I couldn't stay awake.....might be a good for a group of pre-teens having a slumber party...."
3,Not what I thought,"It wasn't very clear that this is the documentary on the true story of the haunting in connecticut. I thought this was the movie, but it isn't."
3,I should have read the description a little more carefully,"This is just the TV show that was on the Discovery Channel. I thought it was a movie or a documentary. I remember being disappointed when I saw the actual show on TV, not only because the intensity of the haunting did not really come through, but also because the actors were so bad. I can't return it now because it's my own fault that I bought it. Lesson learned."
5,Very entertaining,"This documentary is rather long (1hour 35mins) compared to the episodes on TV (~45mins). Nevertheless, it keeps your attention the entire time. This documentary is far better than the movie that came out, which was a huge letdown for me having seen this first. I highly recommend this documentary as do I all of the ""A Haunting"" episodes....except the one in Georgia (boooring)."
3,"Great Episode, but fair quality DVD Transfer","To start with, I love all of the ""A Haunting"" shows shown on Discovery Channel. My only gripe with this one episode is the poor DVD transfer. The DVD is very dark in many areas when compared to the broadcast version shown on The Discovery Channel. They could have done a much better job in transfering the show onto DVD. The dark areas on the DVD are much brighter on the broadcast version of the show. Still worth getting. The Haunting shows look wonderful on Discovery Channel HD. I wish they would put them out on Blu-ray. Fat chance of that since the show was cancelled."
5,Thank You!,"Thank you thank you thank you Amazon for making this DVD available for purchase. Ever since I first saw this on the discovery channel late one night I knew that I needed to own it. I haven't read the book as yet, but that's my next stop. They're even releasing this story as a full length movie into theaters. As soon as I saw the preview I knew that it was this same story. I rarely get scared to the point that I have to take a break from something, but this was one of the programs where I had to stop, put on the lights and take a break from the screen. This gave me goose-bumps. Take my advice, buy it and watch it. You'll love it. It's the best of the series!"
2,bof,i don' t understand why everybody scare about this so i bought the dvd i watched it yesterday and i wasn't scared at allif you want to be scare you have to watch the exorcism of emily roseor amityville 2 possession
4,"Over the top, but good.","This particular Haunting segment is over the top and obviously embellished. But, for entertainment value, it is one of my favorites."
2,not so haunting,dident like this film much a bit over the top and found it a little boring and girl in house alone no lights get the picture.dident shock or frighten me and im the one who gets scared quite easily . if you want horror watch decent now that scared me half to death . brian
1,"Not scary and, worse, not believable","Poorly filmed, poorly scripted account of a ""true"" haunting that, miraculously, has zero recorded proof of its existance. About as frightening as a sack of baby rabbits. The film is made all the more unbearable by the constant recounting of the events the viewer HAD JUST WATCHED; this occurs about every ten to twenty minutes."
5,Really like this stuff,This stuff smells clean and fresh (mint) and it really does help with odor. I used it around my litter boxes and it helps better than anything I've used. Great product.
5,Wonderful!!,"I watched the whole series growing up when I was about 13 years old. My parents were having marriage problems and had bought them. They didn't help my parents much, but they have left a lasting impact on me. I really enjoyed watching them even as a teenager. And now 14 years later, I attribute my wonderful marriage to some of the good advice I learned as a teen from Gary Smalley.I am trying to get my hands on these movies now so I can go through them with my husband (of 10 years). I can't wait to watch them agian."
4,Stop renting from cable company!,Sick and tired of all the charges cable company charges ? Get rid of renting this when you can buy one reasonably priced!
4,Seems to work great,I have owned one of these for about a year and it seems to be doing a great job. I have no idea if others would have been better but this one works for us.
5,Cost effective,The easiest way to save $84.00 a year on modem rental. It's working fine too.[[ASIN:B0009IRUKG RCA DCM425 DIGITAL CABLE MODEM (For Comcast)]]
2,Not for Comcast (MN),"I purchased this for use with my Comcast cable system - when they looked up the model they said it is too old and an ""end of life"" product - and refused to use it. I plan to return it. Before you buy any cable modem, check to see if they accept the model/brand of equipment."
1,GARBAGE!,"Bought this modem thinking ""What a deal, it will save me $$ in the long run"". WRONG. This thing is garbage and came broken. I just attempted to connect with Comcast on the phone for 1 hr and they could not get a connection. The modem I am currently renting from them works just fine but the second I connected this thing they could not find a signal. Long story short...buy a different modem. What a HASSLE!"
1,RCA DCM425 garbage,"This is the second RCA piece of junk that Comcast has stuck me with. I subscribe to the 16 MB package yet I have no recollection of this modem ever exceeding 2 Mb. According to 2wire.com my average bandwidth hovers in 400-500kbs range!!! Fed up with repeatedly calling Comcast to complain about my horribly slow service, I purchased the Motorola surfboard SB5101. My ""average"" bandwidth has jumped to 5.5 Mb with burst rates up to ~13 Mb. FINALLY I'm able to approach speeds that I'm paying for.If you use an Internet phone service, this unit will definitely test your blood pressure medication.Stay away from this P.O.C."
5,Buy this product and save $8 a month,"I really have no idea why would people not buy this and pay Comcast $8 a month. Just buy, and see your savings.It works fine.Delivery took little longer but its ok."
1,Modem did not have all the features that were listed on it.,Becareful on this one. It may work as a cable modem but dont use it for phone support with a group such as comcast. In the description they said it had support for it but that would be impossible. They do not have the port on the modem. Now I just use it as a paper weight.
1,"Broken Item, Not as described!","Item was specified as being in used but ""very good"" condition. The modem first off had a large crack along the bottom of the modem. I attempted to plug it in and use it anyway, and the modem would not connect to the internet at all. It is the same exact model as I rented previously so it was not a compatibility issue, the modem was just broken. Poor service, be weary of buying this."
5,Good cable modem-it is what it is,"I don't know why so many people are having problems with this unit-it does very well for me.The stock power supply may be at fault here. I connected this using my old Toshiba's cable modem power supply.It is rated at 12 volt DC @ 1 amp and is of the linear regulated type.The AC adapter supplied with the RCA is one rated 9 volt DC @ 500 ma and is a switching type.I believe it may be the underlying cause to all these problems because my RCA has been rock solid reliable and fast.However, I do not own this unit, it is supplied by Time Warner Cable. If anything goes wrong with it, I bring it back and get another-simple!"
2,Not good enough,"I've had it from Comcast and it was working quite well so I had no complaint.It dropped connections once in a while, but no biggy because I didn't know better.However, when I switched to motorola Surfboard, I was astonished by the difference.Connection never drops and download and upload speed TRIPLED!! 10/5Mbps to 29/10Mbps!!!So get something better rather than this one!"
2,No Way!,"Crappy! It looks cheap, feels cheap, and works cheap. I would not recommend this product to anyone! That’s all I really have to say."
3,it is what it is,"this has no cables or power source, instructions, or software. works but you must be creative cost more in the long run"
4,RCA modem,It virtually is the same brand modem which Comcast (Xfinity)had us using for their internet service and will save us $7.00per month for as long as we use Comcast. This modem is a good value.
4,Great Modem,"I purchased this modem from INVENTORYRECOVERYVA to avoid the monthly $3.00 rental fee from Comcast. The modem was shipped quickly, as described, and perfectly matches the standard issue Comcast modem."
1,A Piece of Junk,I am getting ready to turn in my third one of these to Mediacom. They keep issuing this same modem and the modems crap out between 6 to 12 months. They start by sporadically dropping the connection and resettting and finally won't connect at all.
4,RCA DCM425 Modem,"This modem is a good working unit. Our Internet Service Provider issues this modem to its subscribers. One can expect it is a good purchase. However, in my case, the cable I received fit too loose to keep a connection. Maybe it was the wrong cable sent out to me, or maybe it is a defect? I would otherwise believe this is a good modem and a safe purchase. I will get another cable."
5,RCA digital Cable modem review,"It works for me. Hope it continues to work the same way :)I was paying $7/month for the rental. If this modem works for 3 months, anything over is saving."
5,Installed easily and works great.,"I bought this modem to work with Comcast Internet. The modem installed without much problem and Comcast ""recognized"" the it without any issues. My over two years old linksys wireless router worked with the modem right away. I have been getting great upload and download speeds. Over wireless network, I measured 12MB/5MB per second upload/download speeds. On wired connection, the speed was about 50% better. I have no complains. This is a great product for a great price."
1,Won't support cable phone,"Like most customers apparently, I ordered this RCA DCM425 broadband modem to get out from under the monthly charges for renting a modem from Comcast. It's billed as the same one used by Comcast... but it's NOT! I found, to my dismay, that when I went to swap it out for the Comcast rental RCA unit, the new one from Amazon lacks one vital feature: a telephone output port. We recently bundled our services from Comcast and now take TV, broadband cable ...AND telephone from them. But, without a telephone port, I'm going to have to return this one to Amazon and look for one with all the ports I need. BE CAREFUL, BUNDLERS!"
3,Small and....,"With this modem have had average speeds of about 8 mbps downsteam and 750+ kbps upstream. After only three months of servive, this started having serious connectivity issues, slow speeds and dropped connections. After a few weeks of this, it failed to connect at all. Further investigation revealed that two capacitors had died. Replacing these using high quality parts with doubled capacitance value, I now have average speeds of 10 mbps down, and 800+ kbps up. These speeds are on par for the service I subscribe to. I am currently shopping for a replacement, no telling how long this will last."
3,"Well, it works.","This is the one my cable internet provider sent me home with today after I took a gradually failing modem back to them for replacement. It's sitting next to me blinking as I type this, and it's working fine. For the current price the used ones are getting, might be a good deal."
1,Much better options out there...,"I have had nothing but problems with several of these modems. When the Comcast tech came to install it, he went through 3 of these before he found one that worked! This piece of junk has frustrated me for the last time.The only thing this modem is good for is dropping your connection. Every time it gets a half decent download speed, it will lose the connection, every single time. Like to watch steaming video? Don't even bother with this thing- videos stutter, freeze, and crash the browser.For the entire time I've had to put up with this thing (5 months), I have never gotten any higher than 1/3 of the speed that I am paying Comcast for, and that was only burst speeds. This modem WILL choke your bandwidth- don't get it, unless you want to pay for bandwidth you can't use. I am returning it to Comcast the moment that my new Motorola arrives. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,Not good for hardcore internet users,"For the people saying that this is a good modem, must not be using the internet at a constant rate. If you are a hardcore internet user like me, where you are constantly downloading, gaming, or web-browsing, then do not rent/buy this modem. You WILL have your internet connection dropped constantly. I have to unplug the cable modem about once every 30 minutes then replug it back in to get my internet to working status. I've called Comcast to make sure it's not something on their side and it's not. It's not my computer either because I used to get download rates tremendously high and no dropped connection before I moved about 2 months ago. After purchasing a my own cable modem instead of renting this one, I have had a large increase in my speed and have had no dropped connections."
5,I don't have to pay Comcast $7 a month anymore!,"This modem works like a charm. It is the exact model that I was paying Comcast $7 a month to rent. Yeah, it cost me 40 bucks, but I figure in 5 months it would pay for itself, and I have shelled over a lot more than that in the last 3 years. Installation = easy, but it is not plug and play, I had to call Comcast Customer Service and give them the serial number off the bottom so that it could be associated with my account. After that it worked just like the one before and now I get to pay a little less on that Comcast bill!"
5,RCA modem,"This is a great modem. The cable guy had an easy time setting it up, it's quick and i've never had any problems with it."
4,The packaging was perfect.,The arrival of shipment is very timely. The modem work good and the package is so nice. I like them.
5,RCAD425 Digital Cable Modem (For Comcast),This product was received MUCH more quickly than expected and has performed perfectly. Would have no hesitation in recommending to anyone else considering its purchase.
5,Very Pleased with this Modem,"This is the same modem Comcast offers. This modem saves me $84 a year! That in itself is worth it! Even it it breaks down in a year, I am only paying another +/-$35 which is a savings of +/-50%. In my experience, I have never had to change this modem out and it works perfectly. You just have to make sure that you have your own cable to hook it up, it only comes with the ethernet cord and you will also have to make a quick call to Comcast to give them the item number. That's it! :)"
3,the cable box,the cable box works fine I don't have cable. but it does work through the computer on dailup to an extent.
2,Stopped working after a week,"Bought to eliminate Comcast modem rent fee (seller: Tirgo). For the first week worked the same as the one I previously had but after that it completely stopped working leaving me without internet...Amazon was kind enough to let me return the product although restocking fee was charged...that's better than nothing.So two stars - one for the first week, one for the return"
3,Inaccurate photo,"Just be aware that you won't receive the modem that is pictured. The modem you will receive won't have the ""Internet On/Off"" button. Requested that the photo be changed to show the actual modem you'll receive but that's apparently not going to happen."
4,It works.,"It's a cable modem, it works. It'll be obsolete in a few years, and then I'll have to buy another $50 plastic box."
1,Not compatible with Comcast anymore,This device not work anymore with comcast service.The seller send one of these devices and I received it. It wasn't work at all. I contact the seller and he asked me to return the device. I returned it and it cost me 7 dollars which equal 33% of the device price. The seller sent me another device and I call Comcast technician and he inform me this devices not compatible anymore with Comcast. I spent 28 dollar without any benefit.
3,Good unit...Bad Cable Company,The unit works great BUT it s the same inexpenssive unit the cable company sets for their installs SO get set for a hassle with your provider. The cable company I have service through only recommended 5 units...naturally the most expensive. When I bought this unit the tech rep tried to tell I couldn't use this unit because they would have to approve the MAC address and this wasn't their approved unit. After going through 5 tech reps and threatening to sue I finally got them to approve the unit. The unit works great and I have had no problems but keep in mind that the cable company has the ultimate say.
4,Good product,"Hithis is good product and work all internet supplier company, but it has little bite high pricesthank youwith regards"
1,I have learned a lesson.,"This is a real ""bummer"". The purchased Modem is defective. It worked for a week or two and then failed. Mediacom, my internet & cable provider, was called in to trouble shoot my system and discovered the ""weak link"", the modem, and replaced it with a new one (which is the same model as the defective unit but appears to be much newer). The seller was notified but insisted that he was ""not a Store"" and does not warrantee his merchandise although he asked for additional info which I promptly provided, to no avail. However, I haven't heard from him since. This $30 plus shipping ""mistake"" has taught me to avoid fly by night suppliers."
5,computer modem,This is the same moderm the internet company uses. It works fine and will pay for itself in less than 6 months. The order arrived on time and as usual and this modem is just what I ordered.
4,Mickey mouse waffle maker,This appliance makes nice Mickey Mouse waffles that the kids and grandkids enjoy.
2,Disappointing adaptation,"Asterix et les Vikings is a disappointing, Danish-made, adaptation of Asterix and the Normans (the film also includes bits of another Asterix book, The Soothsayer). As in the book, here the Gallic duo battles some improbable (and anachronistic) Proto Vikings who have invaded the Gaul in order to know what fear is. It's hard to say exactly what's wrong with this film; it simply has no blood, no vitality; it's a dull effort. The attempts to bring Asterix to the full screen has so far been disappointments: I remember an earlier animated effort (called The Twelve Tasks of Asterix) as well as the atrocious live-actions films starring Gerard Depardieu (!) as Obelix. It might be that the humor in the books is at times both too subtle (with all those historical references) and too cartoonish (with all the over-the-top fights) to bring it successfully to the silver screen."
5,True stories by a real operator!,"Excellent book by a REAL Green Beret! Author did 3 tours in Viet Nam before joining the CIA. So this book contains very few ""embellishments"" or ""artistic license"". The real meat of the book is indeed true. I should know. I had to pry pieces of these stories out of my uncle Jude! Check his other works as well. Although not a writer by training, he was/is one heck of a soldier. And don't forget his brothers' book ""The Vietnam War: A History in Documents"" by John Fitzgerald. A two tour Paratrooper! Both of my uncles were World Class brawlers in their youth when severely provoked, but also the funniest men you'd ever meet!"
5,Mesmerizing,"For the generations that did not exist during the Vietnam era, this book weeds out the rumors and tells the true story of what this war was really like. I could not put it down, I read it in one night. I did not think that J.T. Fitzgerald could ever top his first book Operation Stagecoach Red but I was delightfully surprised! Traitor in White Laces is the perfect sequel and a thrilling ride!"
5,Sunny and optimistic,"Imagine yourself driving a convertible on a bright sunny summer day down route 1 on the coast of California. This is the atmosphere Govi provides with his music - a sense of outdoors, of freedom and breath. With interesting rhythms and orchestrations, this recording was made for you to sit down, relax and put a pleasant smile on your face. Simple, beautiful, unpretentious, a success!!"
5,Perfect for Massage,"This collection of relaxing, slow-paced Govi melodies is a Godsend to me as a massage therapist. Breathtakingly beautiful and relaxing at the same time. I couldn't ask for anything more."
1,Your Lingering Touch: Govi,"Although this new CD had about 14 intrumental tracks on it, more than half were the exact songs as included in other CDs by Govi. Seems like for the price of the CD we should be able to expect new music."
2,too small break easily,"smaller than normal, and the platic breaks easily, specially if using staple gun to install them the plastic is very stiff"
2,Doesn't hold a seal in the refrigerator,"I bought this large container hoping to use it for storing salad veggies. Unfortunately, the seal will not hold in the refrigerator. I get it to seal, put it in the refrigerator and when I retrieve it later for use, I can pull the cover right off. At first I assumed I was doing something wrong. However, I have had this happen each and every time I tried this (at least five times now), even though I followed all directions, made sure there was no moister on the rim, etc., etc.The container is great for storing dry goods in the pantry--the seal holds just fine there. If you want this for anything other than that, do not purchase this particular type of container."
3,Dry food saver,"These canisters are great for storing larger amounts. Unlike the smaller ""designer"" series these can go in the freezer. However, you cannot put them in the microwave and they don't stack all that well. I use these and the larger sizes for flour, sugar, anything that can go in the pantry but for anything else I use the universal lids on old jars."
1,Poor layout and full of typos,"I can see that this book has gotten many good reviews, but i think it is THE WORST textbook I've ever had.Layout is extremely unprofessional. (often insufficient whitespace, inline numbers, symbols, parens and italics, very often flipping back and forth because text and exercise questions reference (poorly drawn) diagrams on other pages) like this is an example of bad layout. heh.Exercise questions are poorly worded. (like Ex 11.5, 14.3)General errors in main text, figures and solutions. (like pg320 last paragraph, Example 13.2 on pg 402, Fig 11.4 on pg 299, solution for Ex 13.6 on pg 641)"
3,Mixed feelings about this one.,"Not a bad networking overview. I found some of the material that was presented in detail overkill. Other material that could have used significantly more explanation, given today's implementations on currently technology, was only touched upon."
5,A very fun game,"Maximum Pool is a very good game that will probably be overlooked this christmas season. It offers a bunch of classic and new pool games. Best of all, you can play them all online against other Dreamcast players or PC players. The classic games are, Carom Billiards, Snooker, 8 ball, 9 ball, Rotation, Cutthroat and Basic Pocket Billiards. The new games are, Rocket Ball, Chameleon Ball, Mad Bomber, Poker and 24 cents. The new games can also be played on some differently shaped tables you unlock by beating the computer players. The computer AI is good, but not impossible to beat. Try it out, you might be surprised."
2,10 minutes of fun,"I have recently bought this game, and i was really thinking it was going to be fun. I like pool, when I personally play, but the game plays the game for you. It is not a challange, and after 10 minutes you will put it away and move on. My suggestion is to save your money and by something that you know you will enjoy!"
5,Wonderful,This is a wonderful book. I bought this as a gift for an 6 year old boy who claimed to own every dinosaur book. Well he did not have this one and he loves it!
5,amazing presentation,"This is one of those must see documentaries, especially for our High Schoolers. If nothing else, it makes you think about what our History books say and what they don't. But questions are always good, especially if they lead you to want to find the answers.Ken Burns produced this, where he usually directs. No matter what role he plays in movie making, his documentaries are among the best. And I watch a lot of documentaries! Having Peter Coyote as the narrator doesn't hurt either."
1,The world according to Ken Burns,"This is revisionist history at its best, the world according to Ken Burns. Where white men destroyed the earth, and it is saved by the black and red race."
3,I was mistaken,"I felt like an ox when I started watching this DVD, as I thought it was a dramatized version of the history of the West. So I waited about 20 minutes before I realised that the ""intro"" was the actual show. The 3 stars I have awarded are thus unfair, as I think this is a beautifully made documentary, but it was not what I expected. So let this be a warning to all other fast reading oxen out there."
5,The West,"Excellent video!! Very informative as well as entertaining.I hope you produce more of similiar quality,Thanks again for this very informative video.John M. Blair15540 Blair View CircleAnchorage,Alaska 99516"
2,Selective History,"I looked forward to viewing this, since the history of the west is so rich. It would have been very difficult to present a comprehensive documentary of its history, but it seems that in this case Ives doesn't even try. He is consumed by victimology. It is perfectly appropriate to give a comprehensive account of the Native Americans and the great injustices that were done to them, although much was left out about the different tribes, regions they inhabited, culture, etc.. I would expect that this would be a major part of the series, which it was. Unfortunately, the rest is literally drenched with some sort of guilt-driven quest by the director to include every persecuted group of people, and individually outline their plights (blacks, chinese, mexicans, mormons). The message has become terribly boring by now. Whites bad, everyone else good. And only a passing mention of the Donner party? Believe it or not, you get a much better history overall from Kenny Rogers' ""The Real West""."
1,Pretty negative story told here,Ken Burns searched high and low to find as many negative stories about the west as possible - and succeeded !! Just revisionist gobbledegook ... would you expect any less from PBS.
2,Ken Burns Presents The West,"Although interesting, The West did not even begin to match The Civil War by Ken Burns. I personally thought too much time was devoted to the Noble Savages. Much singing of the Indians was evident but absolutely nothing to explain what the singing was about. There was no coverage about the outlaws and lawmen of the West. I think that at least some information regarding this aspect of the West should have been included.Overall a somewhat disappointing product. If I had it to do again, I would not purchase The West."
4,"Great documentary, poor video quality","This is a fantastic, beautifully shot documentary. However, the video quality (at least on my BlueRay player) is really grainy and there are some odd visual artifacts."
1,TRASH,Avoid this garbage at all costs. Ken Burns succeeds at distorting and lying about history once again. He needs to retire and put us out of his misery!
5,I LOVE THIS BAND!,This is a great album. VIVA SPACE ROCK! If you were ever a Pixies fan you have to buy this album. BUY IT RIGHT NOW!
3,Unreleased,"Unreleased country album recorded 1974 with Mosley fronting Buddy Holly's Crickets with James Burton on guitar. It seems to be an album to showcase country songwriters, Mosley sings but does not write the tunes. Interesting album, laidback with Mosley in good voice, great players behind him. This is one of those albums that sits on the line between being great for some listeners and ho hum for others. Taxim website has song samples"
4,RIVER ROAD CALLAHAN BROTERS TRILOGY,DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING HAVE READ MANY JOANN ROSS BOOK IN THE PAST AND HAVEALWAYS ENJOYED.
2,Barely okay.,"2.5 stars.I gave the first book in this trilogy (BLUE BAYOU) 2 stars because it is shallow. Well, so is RIVER ROAD; but at least it was sort of fun to see how long it would take Julia to get to Finn. There's just something about a stoic FBI agent. This is a very familiar plot, and the author failed to go anywhere with it. Why do I get the feeling that the third installment will not be enough to save this trilogy from the discard pile?"
2,Disappointing customer service and quality,"My husband ordered this for me as a Christmas present. I think he hoped his days of serving as a yarn holder would be over. Much to both of our disappointment, both wooden screws were missing from the package. This meant that the umbrella portion could not be secured at the proper height and the unit could not be clamped to a table. The only way to contact the seller is through Amazon, and I learned that no exchanges or replacement parts are available -- one must return the entire item and reorder. Well, in the week since our original order, the price went up! Not only do we have the inconvenience of having to return the original item back to Amazon, I have to pay extra for the item due to the seller's poor quality control!"
2,Only So-So,"This book seems to require that the reader already has a good basic knowledge of Mexican and California History -- quite hard to follow and understand. Still, I got the gist and some information. Not recommended as a primer on the CA Missions."
4,Insightful!,"This book does a fantastic job of painting Malcolm X in the eyes of those who knew him and were touched by him. It really gives an insight into the life of one of the most influential men in history. I loved what Maya Angelou, Eldridge Cleaver, and Robert Penn Warren had to say. Other highlights are the interview with Claude Lewis, Malcolm's last TV interview with Pierre Barton, and On The Air with Joe Rainey, in which Malcolm discusses his split with Muhammad. It was secretely recorded by the FBI.Of course Alex Haley's ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" is a must read as well!"
3,"Not bad, but not blown away","The DVD is just OK for me. Umphrey's McGee is one of my favorite bands, and it doesn't showcase what they are capable of. Keller Williams is also great live, but this DVD doesn't give you a true taste of how good he is."
1,Waste of Wood,"This book was printed beautifully, and expensively in color. Unfortunately nobody thought to prepare the woods before photographs were taken: the wood surfaces were not cut or planed but sanded (truly horrible!). I would be ashamed to own a copy of this book: it definitely is a waste of the wood which went into making the paper it was printed on.A great deal of the information in this book can also be found in Aidan Walker's 'Identifying wood', a more modest effort which at least is modestly priced. Anyone really interested may be referred to R.Bruce Hoadley's books."
1,Don't try that at home,"A caution seems in order. Over the millennia many tools have been developed for working wood, but razors are not among them. Using a razor on a dense wood will result in ""wood marks"" on the razor, that is, in the best case. It can go horribly wrong.The only reasons that only ""minor marks"" can be seen here is that the haze of sanding marks and sanding dust overlies everything.On the positive side the book is well printed and bound, and of course wood is so beautiful that even the treatment doled out here can not obscure its beauty entirely. Somebody who never saw wood or does not own any proper woodworking tools may be impressed by this book. However such a person would do a lot better with the ""Good Wood Handbook"" by Jackson & Day (cheaper too!)."
2,It's great for any video games system except PS2.,I have this video game station and it was great for my playstation console and nintendo 64 but if you got a Playstation 2 and you are planning to get this you should not because the PS2 won't fit in it at all!
4,Very Good But......,"This station is ok, but for the cost of it you probly could go to the local Lumber Store and slap a cupple pieces of plywood togeather and have the same thing for cheaper.I bought this and it is worth it but not the cost."
2,It's not worth it.,"I've listened to this CD approx. 10 times, none of which all the way through at the same time. It has a few good songs, such as songs by the Pharmaceutical Bandits(now called the Rx Bandits), but overall it's really not worth it. They gip you with only a Sublime interview. Oh Well."
4,A great CD for all lovers,Hey man this CD is pretty darn good. I think that if your a fan of the ska/rock genre this would be a great cd for you!
5,"What Movies Can, and Should Be",Everything a movie should be and have: intelligent and humorous script and exceptional acting. The film looks at the foibles of marital relationships without being artificial. Well worth seeing -- a couple of times.
4,Good read!,The stories in the book are first rate. Raymond Carver and Tom Jenks have compiled a story collection that should be on everyone's shelf.
2,Too short and to the point,"This book ended too abrupt. First the women are in the doctor's office, then the elevator and then the jobs are done. What? This book needed a little more excitement and detail. In the beginning all three were together on a train once the funeral ended. At the end of the book it tells were Tess sent for Nikki and Kim. Ok I'm confused, which one actually happened. This book did not do a good job of catching the readers attention and keeping it. It touched on subjects but then just quite. Ok so there will be a part 2 but that's nothing to look forward to since this book did a bad job at explaining situations at hand."
4,WOW,"Donna Hill has done it again. She continues to show she's a talented writer who can write on many levels and in many genres. This story was phenominal. ""Getting Hers"" will keep you on the edge of your seat as if you were in the movie theatre awaiting the action in the next scene. I literally found myself from time to time holding tight to my seat anxiously awaiting what was going to happen next with these three ladies. Fast paced with plenty of excitement, get yours today!"
3,"""What was there to get?""","In the beginning I thought this book was going somewhere, but as it turned out it didn't. Tess, Kim or Nikki could've carried this book by herself. There was no need for intertwinement. I do hope that there is a sequel because we know what happened to Troy and Trust, but who killed Tess' sister, and was Tess on her way to kill Vincent?"
3,MORE EXCITEMENT PLEASE!,"THIS WAS OVERALL A GOOD BOOK. HOWEVER, I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE EXCITING THAN IT WAS. THE FIRST CHAPTER WITH THE PLOTS HAD ME THINKING THAT THE REST COULD ONLY GET BETTER. SAD TO SAY, THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITEMENT THE BOOK HELD. AND THE WORST PART, THERE WAS NO CLIMAX TO THE STORY. I THINK DONNA COULD HAVE SERVED IT MORE!!"
5,They Got Theirs,"This riveting tale of three women on a quest for revenge is nothing short of brilliant. Getting Hers grabs you from the onset, and takes you from a blackout that would change the destinies of these women, to the culmination of their plans to get rid of those who stand in their way.Each of the ladies are from very different backgrounds, Tess, a high priced madam; Nikki, an ex-con who has men wrapped around her little finger, and Kim, a corporate executive with a husband who has a penchant for spending her hard earned cash.Their lives converged in the waiting room of a gynecologist's office and will ultimately unfold into deception, lies, secrets and eventually, death.This was an excellent, fast paced read that kept me rooted to my seat. The twists and turns kept me guessing every step of the way. In the end, I was left wondering when the sequel would emerge, as we are lead to an unexpected ending that could lead to freedom, or, something worse..."
5,Donna Hill at her best...,"This novel starts off at a funereal. We don't really know who died, how they died or any of the details but we know the woman whose head we are inside is not happy about being there. She meets two unlikely partners and begins a twisted plan to recoop some losses and feel better about the hand dealt to them all. A page turner."
5,Great perfume,"since the late nineties I have been using Quasar. its a rare perfume and hard to find in stores. The prelude is fruity with fresh aquatic presence. A combination of rosemary and lavender followed by basenotes of patchouli and cedarwood. this one is a gourmand. Cannot deny that its artificial, but its pleasantly so, and I would not expect anything natural for 30 dollars.Its not aggressive and definitely suited for all occasions.5 out of 5"
5,Super fragrance,"I have used this product over many years and then changed to another fragrance a few years ago. When I saw it listed on Amazon,I thought to try it once more.I have now purchased three (3) bottles during the past few weeks, intent on using the product again for a long time."
5,My daughter loves these books,"My daughter refers to these books as ""The Casey and Caleb books"", and she absolutely loves them. I've been using these books as a discipleship tool with my daughter, and have been very pleased with how they are written. My daughter really looks forward to our time together."
2,Well...,"The bristles are way too soft for it to be of any exfoliation benefit. I'm very disappointed as far as that goes. I use it mainly for scrubbing in my daily cleanser, and it's nice for that, and my face does feel cleaner after using it that way."
2,Handle broke after only 3 uses,"Initially, I loved the cleansing and circulatory effect of this facial brush. However, the handle broke on it's third day of use, scratching my face in two places. I will look for something more durable in future."
3,It Does What It Says It'll Do,"In the short time I've used it, which is 2 days, the brush seems to do its job. During those days that I need to exfoliate it does a good job of softening up my face. Wouldn't try to use it for everyday because the bristles are a bit hard for my sensitive skin & even though the handle is thick, it is plastic so you might need to be careful about how much pressure and heat you expose it to. Haven't had any issues with that so far but overall, it's okay."
2,Bristles too hard,"I think the cut edges of the bristles are actually too scratchy to comfortably use on my face. If they were a little more rounded it'd be a great product. Also, while the cap is a nice thought, it's a poor quality plastic and shattered easily."
1,bad,first when i felt the brush it was really soft but then at the night i tried it on my face. it was so harsh on my skin. my opinion i hate it.
3,Face Brush,"It is generally soft and decent face brush. It has long soft bristles but that's part of the reason why I say it is just ok. The brush bristles are too soft and would have preferred them be shorter since when you use it, it just flattens mostly to your face. When I first used it, several bristles fell off but then after a few uses it seemed to stop shedding and is just ok now."
3,FPO White Facial Brush-Don't use in the shower,The brushes were nice. Felt good and cleaned well. But I learned quickly they just don't work in the shower. Plastic brushes apparently just can't take any hot water on them. They grew hairline cracks from the first use and eventually the head broke in two. Lasted a few weeks each. They are inexpensive so I am not bummed by this. I have had this happen before with other brands too. I guess you just have to use wood brushes if you clean your face in the shower like me.
4,Good for the price.,"I was thinking of buying one of those expensive battery operated facial brushes but I saw this and bought it to try it. I am glad I did, it works just fine. I leave it in the shower and use it every time I shower. The bristles are soft enough and it cleans my pores very well. I just wish it had a bigger and less slippery handle and a little bit bigger brush head, but for the price it is good and I couldn't find any other brush for face that was not battery operated."
2,A bit much for my skin,"My dermatologist recommended that I exfoliate my skin more to keep my dreaded blackheads at bay.But even light circular motions for short periods (constant movement around my face) are just too much for my skin, I get red, irritated skin for about 5 minutes, then I have to wait to apply any kind of astringent because it will burn. :/I'll stick to my St. Ives apricot blemish & blackhead scrub & my 2 hands."
5,great product,Does the same job as the over $100 electric version. The bristles can be softer though. So do not use too much strength when you are using it.
3,"With a little soil, sun and water these grew into Wasp Star","Although I'd definitely recommend most of XTC's back catalog ahead of this collection of demos, Homegrown will be fascinating listening for both fans and musicians. Of particular interest will be the evolution of Andy's I'm The Man Who Murdered Love. The first demo is nothing like the final one at all.The booklet is both informative and fun to read. A pity that TVT wasn't able to keep the two Japanese only bonus tracks. Bumper Cars and Didn't Hurt A Bit are both minor Xtc classics and deserve a wider audience beyond the Japanese import."
5,GREAT!,"This is another great volume in this series,if your a fan of this show? you will want to add this to your collection."
4,Mother is loving her Christmas Stocking Stuffer,"I can't really review this based on my opinion. My mother is an avid lover of BBC American Television from Are Your Being Served?, to the Detective Poirot and Keeping Up Appearances. I purchased this as Christmas Stocking Stuffer and she (we were all) snowed in starting Christmas night until Tuesday Morning and she was in my den, with a some Rum and EggNog (LOL) cracking herself up. I would've thought it was just the EggNog talking but since I've heard her on more than one occasion laughing and talking about this show; (I too have caught a few episodes) it was the show that had her laughing, as well. So I would have to give this a Thumbs Up."
2,Arrived defective and wobbly,"The design is pretty good - very efficient for putting the bird in the kitchen while I cook. But one of the legs does not screw in all of the way making the stand wobbly and barely usable. Not the best quality, I'd look at other stands before buying this one."
2,Not Up to Par for Lucinda Williams,"I found all the songs to sound very similar and each song to lack tune or rythm, almost to the point of being mind-numbing. This CD was a big disappointment, since we had expected songs of the same calibre as those on ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road."""
2,down-tempo studio pop,"I love Lucinda Williams as a songwriter, but this is my least favorite of the records I own by her. The tempos are all slow. The style is basically studio pop. Most of the songs are about lack of connection with other people, which is inherently a difficult thing to write about in an interesting way. I'd skip this one unless you're such a huge fan that you have to own every record she ever made."
4,The title says it all.,"This is my favorite Lucinda William's CD and I have most of them. Not as folksy as ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"", but it is full of emotion. The series of songs from Blue->Out of Touch->Are You Down->Essence are all classic to me. It's a good album to listen to if you are in love (Essence) or out of love (Are You Down). The album ends on two songs which don't quite have the bite of the others; otherwise I would have rated this a 5."
4,Essence is a Good Title,"Essence is Lucinda's most bare bones recording since her first two records. These songs show how much imagery she can pack into her lyrics and how much emotion she can pack into her voice. Most of the songs on this album stand up well on their own, but when placed next to each other, they start to run together. This album lacks the punch of Car Wheels and her eponymous album, but the songs are beautiful. This is a very mellow album that one needs to be in the right mood for in order to enjoy fully."
4,About the title track...,"Overall, this CD does not equal the consistency of ""Car Wheels..."" where every track is a 5-star gem. However, there are some wonderful moments here, in particular the title track, which just seethes with raw sensuality. One of the earlier reviewers made a disparaging comment about the predictability of the lyrics. I couldn't disagree more. I was jolted almost out of my car seat when I heard a woman sing so honestly and openly about sexual desire. And for the reviewer who said some of this song's lyrics could have been written by a 7th grader...you may be right. But remember--she's not talking about love, here. She's talking about sex...as a drug. And that subject does not call for the use of ethereal, metaphysical language. Down and dirty is the proper vehicle. And I, for one, love it."
3,She's a taste,"that I have yet to acquire. Too dreary. She sounds a little mumbly, sleepy or somewhat sedated. I suppose that's fitting considering the lyrical content of most of the cd.However, this is the only Lucinda Williams cd I own, having bought it on the strength of reviews just a few days ago. It sounds like Car Wheels on A Gravel Road would be more to my liking. Time to go find out. Later . . ."
5,Slow burn.,"Okay, so I chunked this disc in the player with tons of anticipation (what? a new studio album and we didn't have to wait five years?) and was promptly underwhelmed by the first track ""Lonely Girls"" as well as the rest. But, of course, I left it in the changer and over the course of the next few days I started to prick up my ears whenever a song from this album would come up on random. And I started to like it. And then one afternoon my attention was grabbed by Lu's ""getting psyched up in the studio"" words before launching into ""Get Right with God"" and damn! if I wasn't hooked. No more random with Essence in the changer. Emotional ride is the perfect cliche' to describe this album when listend to straight through. Lucinda reminds me what it means to have a favorite artist. She never dissapoints. Get it. Hear it. Be patient. PS Check out ""Angels Laid Him Away"" on ""Avalon Blues-A Tribute to the Music of Mississippi John Hurt"", it will break your heart."
5,fits my mood,"I heard that this album was a let-down after Car Wheels, so I did not buy it. Then I went to see Ms. Williams perform near my house and I was amazed. I'm not really interested in comparing this album to Car Wheels or any other album by any other artist. When I play the tracks on this album I remember the show when she performed ""Are You Down?"", ""I Envy the Wind"", ""Broken Butterflies"", ""Blue"" and perhaps best of all, ""Out of Touch"" and to me the sound is just more sad and beautiful than words can say. But sometimes you have to be in the right mood to hear an album the way it was made to be heard. In fact I think this album actually clashes with other material she has produced. Fans in the audience were calling out old songs like ""Side of the Road"" and later on I think I realized why she ignored them -- in those songs she sounds like an angel, and in this album she is just another human being and to me that is just fine."
4,surprise!,"I heard her interviewed on Public radio and decided to try her latest cd. I had never heard her before. Wow! What a surprise. Written from the heart, great studio musicians, and that voice.....if you want to know what a woman feels like with the ""hormones raging"", just listen to the title song..essence...there is nothing like it!!!"
4,Hmm... A good CD but not Lucinda's best,"Overall I rate this 4 stars but relative to other L.W. CD's, it's a 3 star. My first few listenings I was mildly disappointed. It's grown on me but it's still not at the level of Car Wheels or Lucinda Williams. There are some good tunes but the lyrics aren't up to her previous standards. The lyrics to Essence are downright embarrassing for a songwriter of her talent. The lyrics on Lonely Girls are also weak. Instead of writing poems, L.W. wrote phrases. Nor are there some of the tasty guitar licks such as on Car Wheels. I agree with the assessment of another reviewer: if my L.W. collection were stolen, this is the one CD I wouldn't rush immediately to rebuy. Nevertheless, relative to all the other music out there, this is a very good CD."
5,A Good Man Is Hard to Find,"Friends have been recommending Lucinda Williams's work to me for a few years, so I finally took their advice and purchased ""Essence."" Since my only other knowledge of Williams's work is through covers done of her songs, I can't speak to how this work fits in her larger repertoire, but I can say that if this is the essence of her work, then I'm officially a fan. This work transcends popular music--this is art. From the despondency and alienation we hear in ""Lonely Girls"" and ""I Envy the Wind"" to the passionate intensity of ""Essence"" and ""Get Right With God,"" Williams reveals her understanding that the essence of our lives is desire, and for the voices of the women in these songs, the desire is for ""a good man"" or ""The Good Man"". Each time I listen to ""Essence"" I hear this incredible synthesis of Hank Williams, Flannery O'Connor, and Patti Smith--southern irony and minimalist poetry. ""Essence"" is eloquent. ""Essence"" is elegant. ""Essence"" is."
1,Left Turn to Nowhere,"If you love Lucinda Williams the way I do, from the soul, do not buy this recording. Our girl has taken a left turn down a deadend street and it is not a pretty trip. There is not one song on this CD I care to hear again."
1,This is SUCH a Disappointment!,"I don't know what she's thinking of. Every cut is just flat boring, the title song being the most reptitive -- monotonous -- meaningless--offensively boring of all! This collection has nothing to do with the lyricist who provided ""Cresent City"", or ""Passionate Kisses"", or any of the blues covers of earlier CD's. Big ""DUH"" and thumbs down on Essence. Save your dough for when she bothers to sing, or better yet, for when she starts writing again.--Elayne"
5,Lucinda Williams is cookin' . . .,"Like ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,"" this CD takes us on a journey, slowly but definitely surely... these are more road songs, to me, while they may not reference highways and byways. Halfway thru - or maybe later - we are invited into a Bob Marley-type trance, swaying back and forth to Williams' drunken lyrics... but mostly, this is a low-key, slow-burning simmer of great strength and spice. Just keeps us hot - doesn't try to cook us, boil us or stir us. Lucinda lets us be hot. Go for it."
4,It'll sneak up on you...,"After Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, Essence, on first listen, seemed to be a letdown. It just didn't pop right out at me like Car Wheels. But after a few listens, I've come to love the stripped down if not delicate (if that's an appropriate term to describe Lucinda Williams music) sound of the album. You won't be disappointed."
4,Excellent follow-up to her critically acclaimed Car Wheels C,"Essence is Williams' follow up to the critically acclaimed Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. Charlie Sexton has more presence on this CD than last. I like the instrumental quality that Sexton brings to Williams' songs. Songs are longer with more instrumental parts which add to the darkness of the vocals. Williams is an artist that falls between the cracks as she is a little country, a little folk, and a little rock. What she is is a breath of fresh air, all real - with Lucinda Williams, you get what you hear. This is not formula music, but raw music that will touch your soul."
4,Better Than CAR WHEELS,"Except for the slow, boring and sentimental ""Bus to Baton Rouge"" and the incomprehensible ""Broken Butterflies"" this is a wonderful album, better than CAR WHEELS.... ""Blue"" and ""Essence"" are great songs, especially the title track, and everything else is powerful as well. Great work, Cindy! Keep it up!"
3,"Momentary lapse, I hope","The album departs in mostly unwelcome ways from its predecessors. The writing often strains for effect and, lacking the narrative specificity of her best earler songs, comes off as generic. The first three songs rely overmuch on repetitive phrases and other cuts lack the quirky touches that make you want to hear them over and over. Lucinda's voice retains its soulful imperfections, but she affects a druggy slur in some songs that is not wholly appealing. I regret to say that, when her writing falls below par like this, the songs sound like a parody of Lucinda Williams. ""Bus to Baton Rouge"" is a good example, with its unearned sentimental chorus, breathy vocals and blandly efficient backup playing. The title song, by contrast, is a raw expression of lust that is very compelling. It's an exception to a collection that sounds like a side project for airing her lesser efforts."
2,Wanted: better production,"Essence really points out how important production is. Gone is the interesting instrumentation (accordians, mandolins, layers of guitar etc..)of her previous records. With the exception of a couple tracks, gone are the interesting male/female vocal harmonies. Even though these songs are her weakest batch so far, they could have been rescued with some interesting production in the vein of Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. She would have been wise to put these songs in the hands of a Steve Earle or Roy Brittan because they fall so flat on the energy front. It almost seems like she was too close to the project or was surrounded by people that weren't being honest with her. I bought it and will keep it, but I am disappointed that the bad taste of this record will linger until she redeems herself with more of the great work that we have come to expect from her. She should have released a live record to tide over the fans until these songs were ready."
2,ESSENCE - Doesn't do it for me.,"I'm sorry - I've listened to this time and time again and I still don't think it's much to write home about.Lucinda fires up here and there but for the most part there is so much resignation in her voice that the whole effort leaves me flat.I get the feeling she's whipped this one out without much time or effort - it's so monotonous! Give me the narrative style of ""CAR WHEELS"" any day! If it took 5 years to finely craft that album, maybe ESSENCE needed more than it got."
3,"Good, but not much to write home about","This disc is, once again, a testament to Lucinda Williams' ability to evoke strong images of obsession, pain, and longing. So the lyrics and music do the job pretty well. Unfortunately, this disc just isn't as listenable as Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. Whether it's the droning repetitiveness of ""Lonely Girls"", or the drawn out misery of ""Blue"" the cd carves strong images, but can only be taken one or two songs at a time. Stand out songs include ""Essence"" ""Out of Touch"" and ""Steal Your Love"". So, overall, it's not bad at all.....it just doesn't have the raw energy and rockin tunes that Car Wheels had."
4,"Not as Good as Car Wheels, but still Excellent...","I was disappointed when I first listened to this cd due to the huge expectations after ""Car Wheels."" The best tracks are""I Envy The Wind,"" ""Essence,"" and ""Bus To Baton Rouge."" If you haven't bought any of Lucinda's albums, I highly recommend ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"" as your first purchase and then this one if you are really impressed."
2,Sparcity has its limits,"I've been a fan of Lucinda Williams for as long as she's been recording, and I'm very disappointed in this album. It hits one emotional key and pace and then keeps repeating, repeating.Individual songs are sparce and have a certain melodious quality, but none really stand out from each other. The album would have been more exciting if she could have brought some variety to it. And some of her ultra pared down song lyrics seem to miss out on her lyric inventiveness that she's known for."
2,Very Disappointed,"I really liked ""Car Wheels..."" and this one just doesn't do it for me. I listened to it 3 or 4 times and just got more annoyed. Too simple-minded, downright depressing sometimes, and the production is contrived. I think she deserves to be in a more cohesive band setting."
2,Lacks enough essence...,"In brief, I was disappointed in this album. My first exposure to Lucinda Williams was ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"", which I consider to be an outstanding piece filled with creativity, great guitar licks, and real feeling and emotion. This album seems to have been thrown together with leftover songs that lack complexity and polish. Somehow, she left me feeling that her essence was just not in this one."
5,Her Best,"Essence takes Lucinda's songwriting - and performance - to a new level. But this is one scary CD and it may take a bit of getting used to. But it'll get you. I don't know of any current songwriter that expresses human emotion as well as Lucinda Williams. Longing, sadness, frustrated love - she hits you square across the head with it. I hesitate to say it, but there's not an inferior cut on the whole recording. But watch out for ""Lonely Girls"", ""Essence"" and ""Steal Your Love"" - they're dangerous."
4,Gonna have to steal your love...,"Considering the masterpieces that bookend it, Essence should look like the giant failure of Lucinda Williams's career - it's often inconsistent, features some of her weakest songs (""Reason to Cry"" especially), and gravely misses the grand cohesion that makes Car Wheels and World Without Tears the accomplishments they are. The album, though, is something pricklier, and, ultimately, nearly as rewarding as those records. She pares down her production and, for maybe the first time, allows lyrics and poetry guide her wherever they may take her. That leads to the proof that Lucinda's without a doubt the greatest songwriter of the generation - ""I Envy The Wind"" and ""Blue"" take you to the darkest places of interpersonal torment and set up camp, letting every tremor of voice and phrase reveal more humanity than you'd ever think possible. It's a weaker album, to be sure, but with material this powerful, it's a glorious step back."
2,essence of pretension,"the true grit of lucinda does not emanate from her new title ""essence"". considering she took umteen years to release ""car wheels..."" maybe she should have taken more time with this one. I saw her live singing these tracks and she has commodified her style so well that it all just seems so false.bring back the girl who sang for folkways!"
4,True essence of Music,"I will call it true essence of Music and true essence of Lucinda Williams. THe Tracks like ""Steal Your Love"" and ""Broken Butterflies"" really touch you deep in your soul. ""Get Right"" is a blue. ""Out of Touch"" takes you to your memories. over all a worth buying album."
3,ZZZZZZZZ...,"""Car Wheels..."" was (is ) an album that made me sit up, take notice and listen to over and over again. ""Essence"", with a couple of exceptions, is just kind of boring. Sorry, Lucinda, but you can definitely do better. Oh yeah, your old band was better also."
3,Essence,"I was very disappointed with this CD. I expected originality, inspiration, in other words, the usual Lucinda. What I got instead, was maudlin, predictable, middle-of-the-road music. Not at all what I expect from Lucinda. By the way, I own every CD she has released."
4,second listens,this is a very complex record very different then the twang ridden car wheels record. the record grew on me not all the songs are classics but a few are.the opening track is haunting as wheel as the title track nut it was the track titled bus to baton rouge that had me hooked. not as easy listening and toe tapping as car wheels but very intense and haunting
2,NOT GOOD!,"You can't understand the audio and the pointer moves backwards when you pull the lever. If yu have the pointer on the letter ""E"" you usually get the ""D"" or ""C"". Don't waste your money!"
4,Strange,"This is a strange toy. First of all, the audio is pretty bad. It's hard to figure out what they are saying some of the time. They also picked some really strange things to represent letters. But overall, my daughter likes to play with it, but I would wait until it's on sale with free shipping to buy it."
1,Buyer beware,"This gets one star not because of the show which is arguably one of the best british comedies ever written but if you purchase this please note that it is NOT season 8! It is a reprint of BBC season 6. So if you are collecting the set and looking for S8, Google the episode list first. The supplier refused to even answer my email queries on the product."
5,Review from the Publisher,"This is Volume One of a Two volume set. 458 Pp. PB. Impr. 175 Illus. Stories of 55 saints, beati, and holy people of the past 200 years, along with their pictures; most are actual photographs. Sanctity in our own time.

Will bring hours and hours of pleasure and entertainment to the entire family. A book you just cannot stop reading!!"
2,Should be less,"This item was cute, looks a lot bigger in the picture, is definitly not worth 60 dollars, more like 25. When I got the item I was excited, but then it turned out really small, and the frames do not hang straight the bottom is more against the wall than the top."
2,Would not buy again,"Product arrived on time and looked like photos online. However, the packaging was not that great. Two of the glass holders were chipped. Also, once I put the photos in and hung the piece on the wall, I could not (nor have I since been able to) get them level or straight. The hanging wires must be slighlty uneven. I've got it as close as I could and it just still doesn't look quite right. Neat concept but just poorly executed. I would not recommend buying this item."
1,I would give this a zero star if possible,1 star for the artistic way it looks. 0 stars for practicality. Should have listened to the other reviewers about how this has so little chance of arriving in one piece given the way it's packaged. Had to return it but even that was a hassle since the box is enormous for such a small item.
1,Not impressive,This item came in a jumble. The glass was chipped. When I hung it up one of the wires was too short making the frame hang crooked. Also it was smaller than I thought it would be and not impressive. I would not recommend this product. Not worth the money.
2,Got the deal for 3 pic trapeze and 6 pic trapeze combined,"I read the two other reviews on the product and after pricing it elsewhere, decided to take a chance. The three pic frame arrived and from what I can see without opening it, is undamaged. Though minimally packed it seems the box was sufficient sealed. Now the second 6 pic trapeze was an absolute joke. The idiots put it glass down in the box with just the extreme minimal packing, then put all the rest of the protective packing on top! The box it came in was barely sealed and had gaping opens where the tape and box should have met. A 5 year old child or drug addict could have done better!!!!Amazon is good on taking it on the chin but still I must wait another week to replace this. I'll let you know how the rest goes...LOL Took pics but dont think they will let me load them here."
2,Umbra Trapeze 6-Photo's Hanging Frame,We received the package - opened it - placed them on the dining room table - they initially looked nice/together - the next morning we looked at them & noticed of the two pieces of glass - the bottom had breaks - we were forwarned by other purchase people - we put FULL photo's in the Umbra to cover the breaks - !!Linnea & Robert Saputo
1,Arrived broken,"Arrived broken, have made repeated requests for replacement but have had no luck at all. Really unhappy because this is a Christmas present and I ordered it in loads of time!!"
4,Nice but...,"Looks great, works great, but a bit difficult to use. Adding the pictures is quite the process and takes a while."
1,Absolute crap video quality...,This is the old Chronos video VHS version transferred from the VHS tape to DVD.The video quality is horrid crap at best. Total waste of time and money.Magic Arts is nothing more than a bunch of money grubbing thieves...
4,dvd,"it is exactly what is says on the box, not that much to argue about, but I was glad to find this DVD."
3,False winnings!!,"This is a pretty good handheld version of Texas Hold'em. The only problem is that sometimes the computer will beat you with a hand that is clearly lower than yours. Example: computer will have two pair 9's and 8's(off suit), and you will have a flush, and the computer will beat you. It kinda defeats the purpose of the game really. I am just waitng to see if the computer can beat me with a a pair when I have a royal flush! Good luck"
3,Great game.. if it works,"This game plays well. It is a virtual tournament with computer players entering and leaving a table when broke. If you play well, long enough it comes down to a showdown with you and the one remaining computer player. It is great fun to play and semms to simulate players of different styles fairly well. I would have given it 5 stars except for concerns about the quality of the hardware.I first saw these at Wal Mart. The packaging allows you to try the game in the store. I had to try five different units to find two that worked. The other three were completly dead. I bought the two working units for Christmas presents. On one of them, the check/call button quit working within a month. That only leaves one of the five I looked at in proper working condition."
4,radica poker game,subject item was received in a well packaged unit just as described. It works just like a new one. Thanks.Radica No Limit Texas Hold Em Handheld
3,Not so good,"This broke after playing if somewhat extensively for a few days. Some of the hands dealt, when it was working properly, were a bit unbelievable."
5,Perfect to give to someone with a Sept birthday!,"I ordered this September beanie baby from the seller MarEtoys, and it was at my house in just 2 days! I bought this for my daughters first birthday since she's a September baby. It's a perfect gift that she can always hang onto that will mean something to her. It came with a tag protector too. Very happy with the quality!"
5,"I'm not much for words but out of the four deck I own, this is by far my favorite. The art work is amazing! I highly recommend..","This deck is beautiful and if you're interested in a deck that is visually incredible, I would recommend this Crystal Tarot or the Thoth Tarot aka the Crowley Deck. But the Crystal Tarot is one of the most beautiful, in my opinion,Good luck and have a blast with whichever deck you choose, or with whichever deck chooses you!"
4,Crystal(tarot card deck),It was a nice set of tarot cards that I bought as a birthday gift for my sister. She has just started to use them.
3,"Art work/illustrations are superb, but....","...I was disappointed that the Minor Arcana cards showed suit pips only (eight coins only, or four swords only, for example) and no illustrative pictures which express meanings/moods of cards. The decks I use and relate best to (mostly Universal Waite and Morgan-Greer) have pictures (which include the pips in an entire illustration) for the Minor as well as the Major Arcana. Had I known that the Minor Arcana cards did not have complete pictures, I probably would not have ordered the deck. Again, though, speaking as an illustrator myself, the artwork itself is beautiful throughout the deck."
4,Fun vocabulary expander,"A fun read and entertaining way to expand your vocabulary, whatever your age."
5,Best vocaburary learning aid,"I admire 1000 most important words. It explains about a word in detail by using various interesting facts, example sentences, words of famous people, and lines from a famous play. It is far more interesting than dictionary although I recommend you to check this book after looking up a word in a dictionary. It will give you clearer idea of a word and help you to familialize with it. Not only this book is helpful but also this book is very much fun just to read it in a way you read regular novels. It is a shame that this book is out of print. I believe this book is one of the best vocaburaty guides. I use princeton review's word smart, 1100 words you should know, and hot words for SAT along with this book, but this one is the only one I do not mind reading in bed before I go to sleep. It is that much fun simply to read this book!"
3,Really Hard,"when u get it, it is fun. but after u beat the pirates it is impossible to beat. my friend gave me this game. dont buy this game, it is really hard. dont waste ur money."
5,BEST MEGA MAN GAME BABY,A VERY KOOL GAME LOVE 3D GAMES ANDTHIS IS ONE. WHEN I FIRST PLAYED THE GAME. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN LOVE THE GAME BY HEART. IT ROCKS BOMBERMAN OUT OF THIS GALAXY.
2,A real dissapointment,"I have played all the opther mega man games, and i liked them all. this game is not only a disgrace to the mega man series but it is one of the worst n64 games i have ever played. yes, it is 3d unlike most of the other mega man games, but you will stop liking it quickly, the dialouge is moronic, controls just don't work... i could go on and on...."
2,Bad bad bad,A have to admit Mega Man games used to be so cool but now they all are just terrible. All the good story lines and boosses have already been used so there down to penguins and vultures.
1,Crappiest Game Ever,"This game sucks. I really enjoyed the original Mega Man but this game has nothing incomin with the original. First of all the controls are terrible. U cant just turn u have to stop then turn. After awhile this gets very annoying. Second the graphics for this game are very poor. U would think that since Mega Man was gooing 3-D the graphics would be better, well your wrong. the graphics just plain suck. Last the game is really only a little fun for the first 5 minutes u play but after that its very boring. Overall this game is very bad and is not worth buying or even renting. TOTAL DISAPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!"
4,An all-new style of Mega Man,"Mega Man 64 is a great game. There are hundreds of weapons, thousands of items and millions of secrets. Albeit some of the weapons are dull (splash mines) but others more than make up for them (shining laser!!). Even little things are secerets, from Dark Mega Man to hidden parts. The storyline isn't much and the dialauge is simple, but the gameplay is awesome! I hear many people complaining about the graphics, too. They're none the worse than any other N64 graphics. And for those of you who think camera angles are obstructing your gameplay, here's a tactic: circle straefe. Hold Z and right or R and left and there you have it. no problem."
4,Its Really Just Fun,"ok, this game has 3 major cons:-Awful graphics (drawn on shading)-Hard to get used to controls-Bit Short (not that bad)At this point your probly saying ""this game sucks,"" but its actualy great! i like games like pokémon and such where its like a full time job to keep up with the stratagys and you do alot of the rpg styal turn based attacks. if you are like me you will love this game almost purly for the contrast, once you get used to the controls this is a game you wont want to put down. its alot more strait out than alot of todays games but the geting items and turning them into great weapons is very fun. but it does have stratagy, you chose what to put in your buster and where to spend your money.. there are plenty of sidequests and great minigames =) you might want to rent it before you buy it though. for some people thats all you need"
4,mega man 64 is a must buy,"this is one great game. Nothing like the originals, but its great. Mega Man and Roll are in the game, but they look totally different. Mega Man is a digger which is someone who goes into caves and looks for crystals and stuff. Roll gives you advice and stuff. Also, there is roll's grampa, Barrel Casket. they are looking for the mother lode, which is some sorta special; treasure. There is lots of room to explore, and if you search you can find parts for roll to use to make you arm weapons like mines. and you use your megabuster. there are lots of mazes to navigate which are challenging, and the boss battles are pretty tough. you can talk to all kinds of people and donate money to the town. Note: Megaman is a boy, not a robot. buy this game. P.S. the old meganman games do not stink they are classics"
3,Fun Nostalgia,"I loved this game while I was a kid. Looking back there are a few problems. Since this is a 64 version of the game, the controls are a bit clunky while trying to move Megaman. Second bad thing is some of the voice-acting is kind of horrible compared to modern classics. The game is pretty nice to have for nostalgia but only has these two problems."
3,Nothing Amazing,A good cd but nothing amazing. Actually reminded me a bit of Amoeba and even Mogwai in some ways. I did enjoy Apart but it can get a bit draining.
2,Good for Beginners but...,"This book is actually good for the beginners. This book clearly shows where the major and the minor lines are and also the exact location of the mounts. But if you are looking for a book which will help you become an accurate palm reader, then this book is not for you. I noticed that many things written in this book are not true and unscientific. People who bought this book will realize this once they studied their palms and that of others. I recommend ""The Benham Book of Palmistry"" for serious students."
3,Absorbs quickly,This cream absorbs quickly and you can feel a difference with regular use. The one thing I don't like is the jar that it comes in. The opening is small and you have to dig your finger in there which I don't like. Other than that it is a pretty good cream.
5,5 Stars for Soleus Tower Fan,"Highly recommended is the Soleus Oscillating Tower fan.This is what i like the most+++++Silent, does not have the whirring and buzzing of a conventional fan+++++Narrow and slender ~~ a vertical fan so it takes little floor space.++++Comes with remote, can use selections of speed and switch on and off from a distance.+++++Very well priced, good value for the $$$Karen de la Carriere"
3,Kind of a letdown...,"Wasn't nearly as creepy or scary as I was hoping for, especially after reading other reviews. The acting was a little cheesy.I guess what is scary to some isn't always as scary to others. Of course, I may be somewhat desensitized to scary stuff as I am a huge horror fan and have been watching horror movies and such since I was 5 or so: I'm 29 now."
4,A Haunting in Georgia,"This was a very interesting movie about a family with each member having a different degree of sensitivity to seeing ghosts, and paranormal activities. I also purchased A Haunting in Connecticut which I enjoyed more. A Haunting in Georgia is more a documentary style where as A Haunting in Connecticut is like watching a movie. Both were very entertaining as well as scary."
4,"A little slow, but good.","This segment of A Haunting was a little slow, but really good. I enjoy having it in my collection. If you like the series, you will like this one."
4,Funny and moving,"Ms. Leslie has written a very amusing book, that is sad and moving as well. Fleur Leigh ages from 10 to 12 in the course of the book. She is a Hollywood child, the daughter of Charmian Leigh, a radio star trying to get into TV, and Maurice Leigh, a game show producer. The 9 chapters of the book(it takes place in the 1950's) are organized roughly around Fleur's nannies, who don't last long. Charmian Leigh, the mom, is a wonderful creation. Selfish, ambitious, histrionic, full of bad ideas, she is reminiscent of some of Dickens' meaner characters. The book is funny, but Fleur's search for affection and kindness is very serious. Constantine, the gardener provides kindness but his employment is always in jeopardy due to Charmian's jealousy. So the book is funny- the wealthy in Hollywoood funny- but also our affection for Fleur makes it affecting as well."
1,sorely disappointed,"After reading the wonderful reviews, I could not wait to get this book. I was sorely disappointed. Fleur's life although tragic was stereotypical in a non-violent ""Mommy Dearest"" kind of way. I found this book to be trite and boring."
1,Waste of time,"In my opinion this book is pretty much a waste of time, being a very rambling, often unlikely, quite amateurish (throw in lotsa description) series of pages. Knowing that the ""hero""/author is a gay Colombian, one might expect some realistic expression of his situation; but essentially nothing . . . Save your ""postage and handling"" - - even the one cent for ""used"" doesn't warrant the delivery cost."
4,short but sweet,"This short novel represents some of the best qualities of modern literature. It's a bit of a mystery, and I may well read it again. Being my introduction to John Banville, I will undoubtedly read some of his other work. Recommendation: read this book slowly, and savor it. Then pass it along to your best friend."
4,Rudiments of new hope,"An historian, on the verge of nervous and mental breakdown, is trying to complete a book on Isaac Newton in a rented cottage in Southern Ireland. The fact and circumstances of Newton's mental collapse of 1693 give him possibility to discern the vacuity of his personal psychological hellhole and urge him into interlacing of real and fictitious love affairs that lead through nothingness to rudiments of new hope and understanding.The language of the book, its pseudo-Gothic shades of mystery and psychological descriptions of the heroes are excellent. But the plot is rather weak in comparison with such masterpieces as 'Flaubert's Parrot' by Julian Barnes or 'Headlong' by Michael Frayn written in the similar manner."
3,Good reading,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment but, nevertheless, it is good reading. One goes have expectations before reading something and I am guilty. LFA"
5,Best biography of Hardin yet.,"Having considered myself a sort of amateur historian of Texas figures, I know quite a bit about J.W. Hardin. Leon Metz's biography is the most honest and thoroughly researched one I've come across yet. This along with Metz's engaging writing style made this book a hard one to put down. He doesn't glorify or vilify this Texas gunman, and the reader comes away with a new understanding of the times and tribulations of those who lived on the frontier. I'm a hard sell, and yet I would recommend this book to anyone interested in characters of the American West."
5,Get to know Wes,"This is a book that doesn't just tell the story of J. W. Hardin, it puts you in the story. Metz vividly describes John's life, deeds, as well as his motivations and even on John's feelings. While some of this is indeed speculation, as nobody can know a man's thoughts, Metz uses known sources and a clear knowledge of human behavior and psychology to put togethor a believable portrait of the man known as Wes. I walked away from this book really feeling like I understood just who Hardin was.This is a fantastic book that is up to snuff with most of Metz's works. I thoroughly enjoy his writing style, and the rolling body count was nice touch, the type we come to expect from this enjoyable author."
3,John Wesley Hardin--he does look like Randy Quaid!,"Dark Angel Of Texas is a decent book, very middle-of-the-road, pretty short. The writing is servicable, flows easily, but certainly won't get the adrenaline pumping like Shelby Foote or Robert A. Caro can, following the same pattern as most histories of this nature: early life, romance, the first taste of outlawism, and then death. It's been done before, many times before, and Metz seems content with doing the bare minimum, not putting any flourish or signature to it, making this something you'll bang out in a day or two and never pick up again."
2,"Just the facts, M'am","Yes, you get the facts of John Wesley Hardin's life, probably more of them than you wanted to know. What you don't get is any kind of decent prose."
5,Great Mat,"Started doing yoga not so long ago and bought this from Amazon. The mat is great and does what I needs it to. It is also a lot longer than most of the other mats I've seen, which is a plus since I tend to be all over my mat sometimes (still a beginner!). It also is really sturdy and sticky enough for me to hold my poses without slipping. I definitely recommend this to anyone!"
5,Love mine,I got this in purple and it's great. I use it to workout to Jillian Michaels as well as for yoga and Pilates. Easy to clean and doesn't move around a lot.
3,good for a little while...,"I picked up this mat because I was looking for something inexpensive but well rated to get into yoga. This one seemed like a good deal.Yes, it does have a bit of a plasticky smell when you first get it, but that goes away over time and i was never really bothered by it. This mat served really well for the first few weeks of yoga, however now that I have moved into more advanced classes I found the real downfall. The grip on this mat is lacking. I have trouble holding several poses due to sliding. If you are one who sweats a lot during your practice I can imagine this problem is made worse.The slipping is bad enough that my practice is interupted almost every time. I will be looking around for a replacement, I have heard many people at my studio recommend Gecko and Jade Brand Yoga mats, so I will be taking a look at those as well."
3,"If you want turquoise, order light green","In almost all respects, this is a nice yoga mat. When you pick a color, just be aware that one (maybe more) mat is not as described. I ordered the 'light green' color, and it's definitely turquoise. Really vibrant turquoise. It looks nothing like the color swatch (which looks light green) or the mat identified as light green in one of the seller photos (which looks light blue). Otherwise, as far as functionality goes, it's great!"
1,Slippery!,"I've been using this mat for a long time, and while it is thicker and softer than most mats, I always had trouble holding many poses (especially downward dog), because my hands couldn't get enough grip, even when very dry. It wasn't until I tried a different mat that I realized that this mat was to blame. It is way too slippery. Save yourself the trouble and get a better one."
4,"Good, but slightly slippery","I purchased this mat because of its thickness, overall good reviews, and the choice of colors. Overall, I am happy with it. Its super thick, proving excellent padding against our hard floors. I got the dark purple one and the color is great. My only complaint is there is some slipperiness when doing poses such as downward dog. However, my hands so sweat so some of that is probably on me. It does not slip about on the floor at all. If it wasn't for my hands slipping a bit, I'd give this 5 stars, though it would be even better if it didn't entice our puppy to try to eat the corner of it while I am using it. ;) Large 70 pound puppies do not make good yoga partners."
3,Not extra thick,"The extra 1/4"" helps because it prevents the mat from being 1 mm thick. This is not a thick mat, it is just a regular one. It is not a bad mat, but it is not extra thick."
2,"Too much sliding, but otherwise fine","I do have sweaty hands, so maybe there is no yoga mat that will work for me, but I slide even in the beginning with my first downward dog. Though the mat was new, plenty of cushion, the smell was not overwhelming, but I have only used it once because it is absolutely useless to slide around like that."
2,Not that great,"So I purchased this mat for going to yoga with and it's just not pratical. I find the thickness to be too much (although I won't knock it too much for that as it is described as Extra Thick) making it heavy. But an even bigger problem with this mat is that there is next to no grip with this at all making most yoga positions impossible to safely pull off. Really useless as a yoga mat however it's making a great padding under our carpet and could be used for other things, just not yoga."
1,:-(,"I really like the thickness of the mat. However after 3 weeks of using it, it is starting to flake apart. Very disappointing!"
1,jasmine green is really ugly.,"In the photo jasmine green looks nice enough...soothing and a little bit of a faded color. I expected it to be a bit sagey and earthy colored.No, Jasmine green is really really bright. nothing earthy and natural about it. More like a lizard or kermit the frog or a green skittle maybe.I actually returned this product because the color was so ugly. I don't want to have to look at an ugly color every time I'm in down dog. Got black instead."
1,Wrong Color! Strong Smell!,"I ordered Light green and the mat I received is Teal green (as shown in their swatches) even thought the package was labeled ""Light Green."" If you want a specific color be wary as their charts are not accurate with their stock. It also has a strong smell that I am hoping will go away with washing."
3,Just OK,"While it is true that is thicker than others yoga mats, the material is so soft you hardly notice. I don't like either the ""sticky"" feeling on my feet, like if I were stepping on glue, I guess that will fade with the use."
1,Disappointed - new yoga studio,"This product guaranteed 2 day shipping with prime. I order the yoga mats on October 12, 2012. Today is October 20, 2012 and still no yoga mats. I order just 1 mat to examine the quality of these mats and was satisfied with the quality therefore decided to order stock for my new yoga studio. Well, needless to say the shipping is totally unreliable. The mats didn't make it in time for my opening and will decide if I will keep them since I had to purchase other mats for the opening.Extremely disappointed :-("
1,Horrible Company,"Be very careful purhcasing from this company. Their return policy and customer service is horrible. I purchased a yogitoes towel from them and was refunded $30.00 less than the purchase price. I also had to pay $10 to return the item, so ended up paying $40.00 for absolutely nothing.Do not purchase from this company if there is the slightest chance you may want to return the item!!!"
4,Good mat,"This is a good yoga mat, its thick, and provides the support I want, but still provides a decent amount of cushion. I got a more turquoise color than I ordered, i wanted the forest green and teal green instead, i wasnt too happy about that."
3,No traction,The only problem I have with this product is that it has no traction. My hands don't stick to the mat when I put weight on them; I have to use a towel on top of the mat to keep my hands from sliding.
5,I love this mat and so does my back and knees,Yoga Accessories claims that this mat is one of the thickest mats available in the market and that got me really excited. I am very thin and regular yoga mats really hurt my spine and knees because they don't offer enough support and I get bruises. To my surprise this mat was as thick and supportive as they said and my back and knees are now bruise free! I can enjoy my yoga practice so much more because I am no longer worried about the pain I am in.I am also very happy with this mat because it is not slippery at all. This brings ease to my mind as well because I am not concerned with falling flat on my belly while in downward dog. I can hold that position and find inner peace and relaxation which is what I was looking for in a yoga mat.This mat has it all for me and I love it!
1,Very Slippery Mat,"My boyfriend purchased this mat for me as a Valentine's present last month. I was so excited to have a thicker mat. First off, I've never had a problem with sweaty feet or hands. This mat was horrible. I couldn't hold any pose because the mat made my hands and feet instantly sweaty. I ended up having to use the gym floor to do any of the leg work. I'm very disappointed in the quality of this mat. Will not order again and will advise friends not to purchase either."
1,Yoga Mat,"If you plan on doing extended standing poses, this mat is not sticky enough. At a height of 5'8"", it is long enough so your head and/or feet are not on the floor."
2,Thick. That's about it.,"I was also fooled by the general good reviews this mat has gotten. If you want this mat for studio practice, don't fall for it. It is thick and ""plush"" as mats go, but it's not sticky at ALL - I can't do down dog and be comfortable in the studio. This means it's nearly, well, useles... I can use it for home practice, where I can control the temp and number of layers I'm wearing, but otherwise, definitely spring for an extra $30 and get a Jade or something similar. This was kind of a waste of money. Just a note, it doesn't really smell at all. I hung it in my closet for a few days and it's almost totally gone."
2,NOT for Bikram Yoga,"I have use this mat since July 1 for Bikram Yoga. I started to notice the mat was absorbing sweat. I would clean with a diluted solution of witch hazel & place the mat on a chair in the sun daily to dry out. Now 2 months later I have to soak up the sweat with a dry towel before drying in the sun and the mat smells funky. If you are NOT practicing yoga in a heated room, you will love this mat. But if you ARE practicing in a heated room pick another mat."
1,Buy a different brand!,"This mat began to ""shed"" after five minutes of use. I had a similar mat made by Gaiam for five years that I needed to replace because it started falling apart, too...but that took FIVE YEARS of abuse before it started flaking so badly. Save your money and buy a better quality mat."
4,"Functional Prduct, Strange color","This yoga matt works great! It provides the perfect amount of traction. I'm 5'10"" and I love the longer length. The only quam I have is that I ordered a Jasmine Green matt. It looked like a nice earthy, neutral color; however on arrival I would describe it as Creme Brulee Key Lime Green. Much brighter than I expected! This is a very functional piece but don't get your heart set on the color in the picture."
4,Decent for the price,"Overall I like this yoga mat. I have only used it twice, and I do agree with others that it is somewhat slippery, but it hasn't caused me any harm. I haven't washed it yet, so that may help. As far as 1/4 inch mats go, this is a good thickness, I just wish that it was easier to find even thicker ones for a decent price. I really like the color and how long it is, and most of the research I did before purchasing this indicated that this was the best mat in this price range, so I think it was a good purchase. I use it about two or three times a week, and will update if it gets significantly better or worse over time!"
2,Mat is too thin for most exercises,"The mat is sticky enough to stick on the ground, but it is way too thin. I cannot do any exercises without feeling pain in my joints."
2,Really disappointed...,"The thickness is good, but this mat slips so badly that I'm going to have to give it away and buy another type. Downward dog was near impossible."
3,Great price but pretty slippery,"I've never done Yoga before, so I wasn't sure what I was looking for in a mat. When this one came, the color was exactly as described, and it didn't smell bad at all like some of the other reviews stated. However, during the yoga routine, I do slide quite a bit when using it. It's really comfortable for doing sit-ups and push-ups, etc. on, but not sure its the best mat for yoga. I think you probably get what you pay for with this one."
5,Thick Mat,I really like this because it's thicker than the usual ones! They come in many great colors so this could make a great personal gift for any Yoga enthusiast!
2,Great but ..,"Seemed like a decent mat - however I ordered RED and the company shipped a PINK mat with an inventory tag that said RED. Don't think my fiance would want to bring a PINK mat to the gym, so it was returned. The carrying case felt a little cheap. I think the price is a little high for the quality of the product."
1,this mat smells super strong of chemicals and slides,"when i opened the mat i figured the smell would wear off in just a couple of minutes. boy was i wrong. Three weeks later, smell is still so strong that I will probably have to buy a new mat. Also it slides . really bad."
3,Not bad....,"Well, the color didn't match the one in the picture but that's acceptable..But the SMELL of it just makes me a little sick :(Other than that, it's satisfactory, since the price is fairly cheap comparing to the average."
2,Colors are not as depicted,"I ordered a Jasmine Green and the mat I got was a bright neon green. Mat itself was fine for hot yoga, but I'm pretty disappointed about the color."
4,Good and inexpensive.,"I bought this mat in gray, and I'm quite happy with it. The length makes it quite roomy, and the thickness adds extra comfort, which is a good thing. I'm giving it 4 starts for two reasons: 1) It can get slippery if you sweat. 2) The color ended up being considerably lighter than I expected. As for the slippery part, wearing toe socks with grip helped, but I still have trouble if I'm supporting myself on my hands; having a towel nearby to dry your hands and the mat might be a good idea."
2,Ice rink when it's wet.,"I like the thickness; I have bony knees.That said, I tried out a warmer yoga class, and this mat got ice-rink levels of slippery when it got wet. I've never had troubles with it doing yoga at 70F, but at 85F+, downward dog became a quick way to injury; my feet took off, and I twisted my wrist trying to catch myself... then did it again. Ow.Will keep using this for more relaxing stretching and yoga, but won't waste my money paying for a hot yoga class if this mat is all I have."
2,Horrible smell!,"The smell of this YogaAccessories deluxe yoga mat is absolutely horrible! It makes me wonder what terrible toxic chemicals are in it that are being released into the air I breathe and entering my body through my skin when I touch the mat. I've been airing it out for several days now and the smell still has not gone away. If the smell doesn't disappear soon, I will be returning this mat for a full refund."
2,Ripped in the washing machine,"When the mat arrived, I decided to wash it before using it. Their website said that it was machine washable, so I put it in my machine on the gentle cycle. Unfortunately, when I went to take it out, there was a long, shallow rip in one side of the mat. I've never had any problems with my washing machine ripping things in the past, so I'm pretty disappointed about this."
2,"Would NOT recommend for vinyasa, power, bikram yoga.","I got the seafoam color. Very soothing. Ended up not being too useful for my practice. It had too much cushion so I wasn't as stable in my poses. Not to mention how slippery it got when I started sweating.Would NOT recommend for vinyasa, power, bikram yoga."
1,Slippery Situation,"I wanted so badly to like this yoga mat. However, it worked better as the family slip and slide. My palms and feet were gently pulled in opposite directions so my face could finally touch the mat's surface and smell the not so lovely rubber scent. I finally gave up, but the mat has made a nice decoration on my wall. Too slick to handle!"
4,Great Mat,I received this on time from the shipper. Took the advise of others who posted reviews. It has a horrible odor so I washed it with soap and water (added a touch of bleach). Hung it outside overnight and the strong rubbery smell disappeared. Would have given it 5 stars if not for this issue.
4,Great yoga mat!,Great mat! I was a bit concerned when I read reviews about the chemical smell. Not a problem . . . I just let it air out over a few days and the smell completely disappeared.
5,excellent mat,Excellent map. Thick with great cushioning for yoga and floor work. Rolls up easily and tightly and doesn't come unrolled. Light weight.
4,Great mat but too slippery.,Excellent yoga mat with a beautiful array of colors. I purchased this mat for studio practice and felt nervous the entire time. It is thicker and longer but because it is slippery it is pretty much useless to me. I don't plan on purchasing ToeSox or grippy gloves but I would need to if I continued to use this mat.Time to splurge on a Manduka.
1,Slippery & not that thick,Felt very slippery. Ended up buying a mat from Target from GAIAM instead. Couldn't even return this because it wasnt via an Amazon shipper. Do not recommend.
2,Slippery!,"I hated this mat, it's so slippery I can't even hold a down dog properly. Really sad as I was expecting much more given the reviews. This was a total let down for me. I would suggest you invest $30 more and get a decent mat that can make your yoga practice as pleasant as it should be."
2,Weird slippery substance on the mat!,"I read the reviews that said this was a slippery mat. Having never purchased a new yoga mat I wasn't quite sure what they meant by all the slipping. They were right. I went to my yoga class sporting my super cute mat only to slip and slide in almost every position. My hands felt like a sticky slippery substance was on them, almost like they were sweating (which they never do). My old mat is old and worn and starting to fall apart, but oh how I LOVE it compared to this new one. Sigh...I will try washing it in the washer and use soap and water and everything else in hopes of getting this mat into usable condition."
3,"Okay, but not what I ordered","There is nothing negative I can say about this mat as far as function goes. However, I specifically ordered red. The mat was a gift for my son whose favorite color is red. The mat delivered was very clearly pink!"
4,Great price but a little slippery,"Perfect yoga mat for someone on a budget. Works well and is a little longer than average so a lot of room to spread out. My house is all tile and I can barely tell when I use this mat.It can get a little slippery during yoga class, so you may want to buy a towel along with the mat, which may negate the savings."
3,"Jasmine Green is a bright, lime green","I guess I'm a girl because I wasn't too happy with the color of the mat upon receipt after selecting Jasmine Green. It looked like it would be a sage-ey light green based on the color sample shown for this mat but it turned out to be a really bright, lime green instead.Disappointed that the color sample didn't really match the actual mat color, but the mat's thickness was what I was looking for, so I guess I'll suck it up and choose to ignore the color and wear this puppy out as soon as I can so that I can replace with a more subtle color."
2,Not very thick,"I love the color of the mat, it is very energizing for me. It also has the perfect amount of stickiness to it and no odors that I have noticed. However, it is not 1/4"" thick as advertised. I measured it and it is really only just over 1/8"" thick. It is no thicker than the really old dirt cheap mat I have had for 8 years. I wanted a thicker mat for my feet but did not find it with this one."
3,Pretty Thin,"Ordered this because the one I got from Walmart was too short and my knees hurt. This one is much bigger, but very thin. I put it over the walmart one tho and it is perfect. So it all worked out well."
5,Mat is great,"The mat is exactly what I needed. When I do downward dog, there is little slippage and there is very little smell from the mat. The only time I notice that there is a slight smell from the mat is when I am doing child's pose. Very satisfied with this mat."
3,Hands slip on mat,"I purchased this yoga mat to use with the P90X workout program. The mat is a good size and I thought when purchasing would have good gripping, however my hands continually slip due to sweat (if you've done the P90X yoga program you'll understand). If using the mat in conjunction with cardio and yoga - do not leave shoes on or it will tear the mat."
4,Extra long,"The width, length, and thickness of the mat are suitable to almost any yoga position I've tried so far. The mat is long enough for people who are as tall as 5'7"". Because of the extra thickness and length, it's a bit bulkier to carry around than most traditional mats."
4,"Seems good, color off","I just got mine in the mail today, love the size and thickness. Got it because of all the good reviews.However the color I ordered was light green and looked almost sea foam in the picture, when I got it it was definitely was light blue. While I dont mind and still enjoy the color it looks different from the picture and the color name is completely off.When looking for this item I didnt see many reviews on color, so here ya go."
5,Perfect for sore knees,This mat is thicker than any other mat I have been able to find in stores. It is wonderful on your knees. I take mine to all yoga classes I go to because I know very few places have ones this plush.
3,Still a little thin for me,"This is my first yoga mat so I can't compare them to anything, but I did find it to be a little thin even though it is one of the thicker mats out there. I do my yoga on a wood floor and with the mat it is still very hard and not that comfortable. I can deal with it though. It is nice and long so i can stretch out head to toe, but the width is sort of thin too. Not very wide, so if I lay on my side with my knees at a 90 degree angle they go off the mat. They are very sticky so that is nice, no slipping! Over all it's a decent mat but not perfect."
2,wrong color,The color of the mat on your site was not what I received. The mat is too dark and I am using this as a promotion piece for a project. I had ordered 4 mats. This is not light purple.
3,Thick but Slippery,"I knew this was an affordable mat, but I was kind of bummed to find out how slippery it is. It's pretty hard to hold a down dog because my hands are slipping away the whole time. I don't think my hands are sweaty, and I've never had that problem with any other mat.The mat is nice and thick, which is important to me! And I've used it for 10+ classes so far and it hasn't started falling apart at all.Also, the color I ordered was Jasmine Green, which sounded nice and soothing for my yoga practice. What I got was neon green, which is no big deal for me, but might bother some people."
1,not pleased,I never received the item and had no way of calling or by email. So this is my way of contacting you.My order was placed on Mardh 13th - I received 3 of my 5 items. The yoga mat and strap I never received these items.Otherwise i love to order thru Amazon.Debbi
1,Never ans answer --- Never a mat .....,I order this mat on Nov 7 ... it supossed to arrive on the 17th ... well i already contact the company two times and no an answer .... I dont even know if they still are planing to send it .... this sucks ... you guys I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO BUT FROM THIS COMPANY !!!!!!! i bought in the pass item from Amazon and never had problem ....
1,"Never received the product, got a refund",Due to an accident in shipping I never received the item. I received a refund instead.
4,Smelly but comfy,"I'm not a connoisseur of yoga products by any means. Whenever I have looked for a mat, I've mainly looked for something that is thick enough to keep me from hurting myself on the floor in a color that doesn't give me a headache. As far as those considerations go, these mats are perfect. With a range of colors available, you can find a mat that will keep you calm. The thickness of these mats is amazing. I was unaware that a yoga mat could be described as ""comfortable,"" but there is no other way to describe it.The only downside to the mat is that it smells peculiar and highly metallic when it arrives. I had to rub it down with mat-cleaner for a week to eradicate the odor. It was worth it."
1,Dangerous/slippery mat,"Thought this mat would be a good bargain but really should have spent more to purchase a quality mat. The quality of my yoga practice really decreased because I was slipping so much in downward dog and upward dog that I was concerned I was going to slip and fall during class. It's nice that the mat is longer and padded, but it's super slippery. Would not recommend."
5,YogaAccessories Yoga Mat,"Because it feels nice and cushy, it comes with a carrying case, and the case has a strap on it."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this mat. The thickness is great, but after a year the mat started falling apart. It started pilling and i find little pieces of it everywhere after i use it. It has also made my hands and feet start to slip and i will constantly have to readjust or put something under my hands. Although great at first, this mat won't last as long as you would like it too."
2,too bulky and heavy,"This mat is very heavy, very bulky and very slippery. I did contact the seller, but they chose to disregard any correspondance, so I returned it for a lighter less slippery mat."
2,"Cushy yes, but very slippery","I loved this mat at first - until I started to do more vigorous workouts. Now I notice how easy it is to slip on the mat. First I thought it was just me, but recently a friend borrowed it and returned it with the comment that it is way too slippery. So this one, while providing great cushioning, is not for me."
4,Good value,"NOT as thick as I had hoped, a bit slippery in Down Dog, but a good value and better than using the gyms smelly mats! Love the color."
1,Slippery!,"This mat is thick and good sized. But, it is way too slippery! I have used maybe 5-10 different yoga mats in my practice, and this is the first time I've had this problem. I do not recommend this mat unless you are only using it for padding. I need to purchase a new mat, or figure out some way to make this one less slippery, because it is unusable as is."
2,"Yoga Mat, just OK","Positives: Extra long, well-cushionedNegative: Very heavy, not a mat you can easily roll up and take back and forth to class. It's a stay at home mat."
5,Nice mat,"This order came very quickly. I bought this based on previous reviews and I am not disappointed at all. It is light, which is great since I don't have a strap. I bought the Soothing Sea color and really like it. It is slip proof and just the right padding so my old body is comfortable in the yoga poses!"
4,it's a yoga mat,"Nothing special, it's a yoga mat. Works as one would expect. As for those complaining about slipping, use the right side of the mat and take off the socks."
4,Great purchase,"I ordered the grey mat and love it. It's a little bit lighter in color than I hoped, but it's just the color so oh well.I don't have any other mats to compare it, but it's not slippery, and keeps me in position when there's tough yoga moves.Love this and I recommend it!"
5,new favorite,"I had to get a second mat as my two daughters always want to do yoga or pilates with me. Well my new mat is wonderful, worth five stars."
1,Not so sticky mat,Just got it recently. I was having problem balancing while doing poses as the mat is not sticky at all. As soon as you start sweating the mat loses the stickyness and becomes real smooth.
2,Color Wrong,"While the mat may be ok, that fact is I ordered a Gray mat and I received a Red Mat. It says Gray on the receipt and on my order. I am disappointed as I feel it's not worth sending it back. But I hope they read this and make sure it doesn't happen again!"
2,Slippery,"This mat is extra cushion-y and forgiving on the knees but it was very slippery. Doing downward dog was an exercise in futility as my feet and hands would just steadily slide out of position. I ended up buying a mat from Lulu Lemon. It was expensive but is an excellent, cushion-y, no slip mat. This mat just sits in the corner now, lookin' sad."
3,Not very sticky,"This is my first yoga mat so I can't say how it compares to others but I was generally pleased with it. I took it to my first yoga class (I mostly do videos at home) and it seemed to fit right in! I was happy with the color (I ordered 'light green' which is actually a turquoise) and the thickness was comfortable. The only problem I had was that I thought yoga mats were supposed to be sticky? I could hardly hold any of the poses because my hands and feet were slipping all around. I really like to push in downward facing dog and this yoga mat was even worse doing it on carpet! Maybe I don't do my poses right, or I had the wrong expectations from a yoga mat?"
2,Somewhat dissapointed,"I was super excited over the price of this mat, but extremely disappointing with the outcome. This mat is so slick that I have to use my old mat over the top of it. My hands and feet slide constantly. I do like the thickness of this mat, but won't end up using it. I will most likely return it."
2,Not what I expected,"This item is called ""extra thick"" and described as ""deluxe,"" but upon receiving it, I realized that it was anything but. I've never used a yoga mat that is so thin. I expected a very thick mat that would be comfortable to do several abdominal exercises on, but instead I received an item that looks like it was cookie-cut out of a large piece of material. Certainly not what I expected or wanted. I fold it in half to make it close to what I expected."
3,Okay for Beginners,"This mat is okay for beginners. I have used my mat for almost a year and it has been pretty good (2-3 yoga classes a week). It is thick, which is nice, and not very heavy. However, it does get a little slippery in downward dog pose (which is incredibly frustrating), even when I am not sweating. But it is not bad in standing poses (I don't slip at all in warrior poses). For the price it is definitely a good mat for starting out with yoga."
3,Yoga Mat good if you don't have to carry it around,"This yoga mat is very thick and it's heavy. I like it for home use, but it's too heavy to travel with or to bring to the gym."
3,Pretty good mat,Seems pretty good on my wood floors. Doesn't slip. Only thing is that it did have some smell when i opened it. Had to wash it and let it hang outside for a couple days to get rid of.
3,"Sufficient, not extraordinary","Fine for casual yoga, stretching or exercises. I would have liked maybe a bit thicker mat if I did yoga regularly."
5,Nice cushion!,I purchased this mat as a yoga beginner and have to say it is very nice. I have used other mats in the past both at the gym and in my home. This mat has been better than any other. It has the right amount of cushion and is long enough to completely stretch out and not be hanging off the end. Went ahead and ordered one for my husband as well.
2,extra thick?,"dont wast your money on this ""extra thick"" mat.. i actually like my old one better... it doesnt slip as much and you have a better grip. I dont see the point in buying this one over the smaller one."
3,"Nice Mat, but to slippery","Very nice quality thick mat, however when you get warmed up and start to sweat a bit, this mat is very slick and hard to hold some of your poses. You can wear socks if needed so your feet don't slide, but I prefer my yoga and pilates barefoot. Some mats have a ""stickiness"" to them, this one clearly does not. I had several of my students test it out and each one said the same thing, just to slippery, which causes you to ""dig"" in the toes and lose balance and concentration. The price was good and thickness is very nice so I'll use it for floor work when I'm not on my feet."
1,too slippery,"This mat is very slippery for many yoga poses. I made an extra mile by thoroughly washing it with soup, but it did not get better. I returned it immediately."
5,Great product!,I really loved this yoga mat! I stand 5'7'' and the length of this mat was wonderful. I could lay down and not be falling off the ends of it. It is extra thick which makes it very comfortable. It seems very durable although I've only had it for a few weeks. Great buy!!
4,Good for the price,Not the greatest mat ever but I loved the color selections and it's held up well after three months of regular use. It's not as thick as I was hoping but it's still better than many of the other mats on the market.
2,Did not work for me,"I bought this mat to do the yoga for P90X. Unfortunately, I didn't find it any more effective than using the carpet in my living room. I was constantly slipping at the hands and the feet while trying to hold the poses. Would not recommend."
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product. It was my first yoga mat. It does not have the stickiness that good mats have for beginners. My feet were sliding on the mat, making it difficult to hold poses and adding a lot of strain. THe mat didn't stick to the floor, either. Additionally, there is a strong chemical smell. Nice color, though..."
2,"MAT IS NOT 1/4"" THICK !!!!","Ordered this mat because it was advertized as being 1/4"" Extra Thick Deluxe. Some of the reviews even make mention of the 1/4"" thickness. Well the two mats I received are simply standard 1/8"" thick run of the mill mats.Update: E-mailed Unique Imports of situation. David replied within 1 hour with apologies claiming they must have packed the incorrect mats my mistake and that they would credit me for the entire purchase price."
3,Color,"I ordered one mat (Light Levander color), but received one that is pink. I sent in a digital pic of the mat, and the customer representative said the pink mat is Light Levander. If you care about the color of the mat, beware."
2,It is extra thick but very slippery,"I was so excited to get a yoga mat but was very disappointed in my first yoga class when it turned out to be more of a workout than I had bargained for. Most yoga positions I did had an added level of difficulty with my hands and feet slipping the entire time. I have never had hands and feet that were overly sweaty but this mat makes them that way. I haven't noticed any funny smell like some of the other reviewers. I gave 2 stars because I do like the extra thickness which provides added padding. I have read some reviewers have put it in the washing machine to make the mat less slippery, so I may try that."
3,Okay,"It's not as thick as I wanted, but I will do the job. It feels thin & long time of sitting okay, but I cant really do situps on it."
5,The Perfect Mat,"When I started doing yoga again at my gym, I used their mats - too thick, too short, too ""slide-y."" I finally ordered this mat and used it last Saturday. Yoga was a whole new experience! The length of the mat felt particularly luxurious as I'm over 5'10"" tall and typically limited my postures to fit the mat. The thickness is just right - a little extra padding to comfort my old knees, but still thin enough for balance postures. I didn't notice any particular smell."
5,Good beginner mat,"I've been very happy with this product--it's my first yoga mat, so I was kind of buying blind. It's nice and thick, and the plastic-ey odor went away after I'd aired it a while.My only complaint is that the ""burgundy"" color isn't really what I'd call burgundy, more of a greyish purple. But I can live with that!"
1,Too slippery,"The best part about this mat is the color selection and the thickness. However, it lacks the grip needed for yoga. I'm currently looking for a replacement!"
1,Not sticky,"The mat was shipped quickly and the thickness was great, especially if you are working out on a hard floor. However the mat is not sticky. I am slipping and sliding on it which can be very dangerous if you're doing jump backs etc. I did not feel safe practicing yoga on this because the mat didn't cling to the floor and my hands and feet didn't stick to the mat. Overall the mat is not stable and stability is needed to practice yoga"
2,Not at all what I was expecting,"I was really excited when I saw this mat, but when I got it and tried it out, it was all squishy and didn't give any support at all. BIG disappointment."
2,Slippery,"This yoga mat is only average. It is very slippery and makes holding asanas difficult, which serves as a distraction to my yoga practice. If I had it to do over again, I definitely would not buy this mat."
4,yoga mat,It's a nice mat but i have trouble with it not unrolling so have to flip it over when I unroll it. Nice and thick but not tacky enough for me.
3,"good padding, but not too sticky","I'm happy with this yoga mat. It has a decent amount of padding, but my feet tend to slip as soon as I get a little sweaty. Also, the off-gassing bothers me a little... I look forward to that going away."
5,Wonderful Mat,"This was a great mat, it shipped quickly to my address and I use it everyday. Color was true to internet swatches."
2,Mat not sticky enough,"The quality of this mat is great, however it does not work for any type of hot yoga. I used it twice since purchasing and was so frustrated by how much my hands and feet were slipping that it really disrupted my practice. After class the second time I asked the instructor if there was anything I could do, and she said that she used to have a mat like this and that the only thing she could do was buy a yogitoes mat to keep from slipping. I should have spent an extra $20 on a nicer mat in the first place as opposed to having to purchase an additional item. Spring for a less slippery mat, even if it means spending more money."
3,Slippery mat,"After researching online, it seemed this mat was a great deal for the money. I ended up receiving it as a gift, and started using it for my once-a-week yoga class. There was a strong smell when I first opened the mat that lasted for a few classes (it was almost embarrassing). Admittedly, I did not unroll the mat and air it out at home, so the smell may not have lasted as long had I done that.The mat is thicker than my previous one, but I still find I need a blanket for certain poses.My biggest problem is that the mat is definitely slippery. I slide the entire time I am in Downward Dog, and even occasionally in wide leg stances. I was hoping it would get stickier the more I used it, but it hasn't. I finally threw it in the tub with soap and water - we'll see if it gets any better. Otherwise, I will definitely need a new mat. Very disappointing when I had read so many good reviews, not only on Amazon, but elsewhere online!"
5,Excellent for P90X,"I got this for P90X and it's excellent. From what I understand it is thicker than ""regular"" mats and it feels so. It is very slip-resistant and I use it directly on a hardwood floor. I'm going to buy another one to use in parallel with this one because for some P90X exercises I need to jump over a wider area and this mat will prevent me from slipping on the floor."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"This is a decent sticky mat. I am spoiled and haven't had to use a traditional sticky mat for awhile. I slipped a moderate amount on the mat and it was more squishy than I am accustomed to, but it isn't a bad mat for the price."
3,"Good basic Matt, but hard to carry","About the same thickness/softness as a standard matt used in the YMCA. Good height and width, again like standard yoga matt. Not slippery so that you can grip it with feet and hands. In sum: just about perfect for my purpose. One drawback is that it's hard to carry and there is no reasonable priced carrying device on Amazon as of this review and purchase. There is a holder that looks perfect for less than $5, but the shipping charge is over $8- too costly for a small strap.I thought that I would just roll it up and carry it, but it's been too inconvenient when carrying a gym bag, water, keys, etc.....Would have been 4-5 stars if they charged a little more and included a strap for carrying or if they had made sure one was available."
4,Yoga Mat,"I enjoy the thickness of my mat. It is true that it can be a bit slippery when 1st purchased. I washed mine with soap and water in the tub a few times and the more I use it, the less slippery it gets(also remember to wash hands of any lotion before beginning your yoga session). I would recommend this one to someone who is starting YOGA. There are probably better mats, but the price and the value is perfect."
1,Slippery,Been using this mat for quite a while now and it is still super slippery. I washed it and everything. Spend the extra money and get a better mat. Not only is this mat not enough padding for my knees but its like a slip-n-slide which is very annoying and dangerous in yoga.
3,Yoga mat,"I am disappointed in this product. I can't use it because yoga mats are suppose to be ""sticky"" so you can hold postures and not slide or slip....this mat is not sticky. My yoga instructor suggested that I put it in the bathtub with dish detergent and water, then wrap it in a towel and run it through the spin cycle in the washer. I have not tried that yet but really I shouldn't have to. I have bought many yoga mats in the past that were fine, no prep neseccary. Maybe there were instructions that came with the mat on what to clean it with to make it sticky but I did not see any."
4,Its a Yoga Mat,"So I've been practicing bikram for about a year now, and my first mat I went to target and purchased the cheapest mat I could find for $20. The mat did its job, was decently slipper, but I had my towel set up, so it never caused any problems. I just lost my last mat, so decided to buy something on amazon to replace it.When I purchased this mat, I noticed there were a LOT of reviews saying this mat was very slippery. I figured it couldn't be worse than my older mat, so I gave it a go. Let me tell you, this mat is VERY slippery! I couldn't believe how much my feet would slide on this thing when they went off my towel, it almost seemed slightly dangerous.But with that said, I have my towel, I'm just the average yoga goer, so I don't need anything crazy.This mat does its job, and for $20 I can't complain. My next purchase however will probably be a more expensive mat, to see what all the rave is about with these ""non sticky"" mats."
3,Tales that Stir Emotions,"Theses superb legends unquestioningly rank among the classics of American folklore, collected well over a hundred years ago. They are genuinely, and refreshingly, different from anything that has been or could be recorded in our own time (up to 1969).Here are tales that stir the emotions, tales of adventures and tales of romance. Young warriors, magicians, proud chiefs, princesses, beasts of the forest, all come to life in stories colorful and varied."
4,Seymour scythe,"The scythe blade and aluminum handle work well together, it is light wieght and works very well for keeping the grass and brush up to 1 inch down along the edges of the roads and fields. It works better than a weed wacker, which gets tangled up with the tall grass and only trims the very small brush."
1,NOT A VERY SMART DECISION BY CASHMONEY,First of all I just would like to know..Who in the world would want to buy a CD with just beats and no rapping? Frankly I thought that this was a very dumb idea for Cash Money to do this. I mean Cash Money is the greatest but this just made me want to forget about them completely. Anyway I strongly recomend that you do not buy this album...well unless you have trouble sleeping at night then maybe you might want to get it because it will bore you to sleep after about the second song. If I could I would have given it about a half a star. Look if maybe this weren't an instrumental CD then I would have definatly given this 5 stars because they had some good song selections on it. But since it isn't beats I gave it 1 star.
5,...manny fresh is a genius...,"...he claims the ol' school sounds of mantronix as an inspiration and you can hear the influence in his music today...but manny is a baaaad man with a vision few posess, afterall, he has produced every single song of every album of every artist signed to cash money (lil wayne's soon to be released album bein the lone exception)...few hip hop producers can have entire albums of jus their music sound complete without the emphasis (or over-emphasis) of a gaggle of emcees harassing the microphone over their beats...but manny does it...he is one of the few producers who deserves 'dr. dre status'...respect his work yall..."
5,The best Instrumentals,A lot of people do not understand the purpose of an instrumentals album. It was not released for everyone to go and buy. It is great for DJ's to just have some background music or to mix with other songs. You can also practice rapping along with the beats. I highly recommend it for the DJ or if you just want some hot beats with loud Bass!
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,there are 20 heat settings and i immediately turn it up to 20 since my old one wouldn't work well unless it was up to 25and ()%&@#it completely damages your haireven if the temperature is ONE!DEFINITELY THE WORST STRAIGHTENER EVER!i dont understand why all the other comments are giving it a such high ratings
5,Masters of the Piano Rolls Granados Plays Granados,"I owned and early version of Granados plays Granados, published by a different company, and containing few compositions. This CD is an improvement over the other. One gets an ample portion of the great man, 74 minutes of his piano playing. Granados was a fast, dramatic player, capable of musical profundity. The selections on this album display his technique in the warm sound of the piano rolls. I am not a particular fan of the Goyescas, but here they sing."
4,Great HTML Editor Plus so much more,"With program that so fluidly integrates with both Flash and Fireworks, a great looking website is a snap. The object libraries make it easy to create complex effects, and the javascript support is superb. If you have been using other editors like FrontPage, step up to what the pros use and what the rest of the industry uses. The online support is great and the program itself is eas to learn and takes almost no time to master."
4,Horatio's Drive,This is a well constructed re-enactment of a fascinating episode in the history of early motoring in America. Perhaps most notable is the insight we gain into the main character Horatio Nelson Jackson who must epitomise the rugged individual whose endeavour embraced this new technology and took it further than current opinion deemed possible. This insight is gained by a detailed and sympathetic telling of the story.
3,Item has not been received by me.,"I still have not received the Danzas y Danzones Cubanos CD. I had to return the CD received because it was not the one I ordered. I fell dissapointed with this sithation. I hope to receive the CD ordered within the next days, due to the time elapsed."
5,Voice trumps all!,"Like many people in the last few years, I suspect, my knowledge of bluegrass music starts and pretty much ends with the soundtrack of O Brother Where Art Thou, so I don't pretend to have any insight to add to the country v. bluegrass debate. But I'm not deaf, and I sure recognize talent when a startling voice like Vincent's shakes up my bones and gets the juices flowing immediately. I first heard ""Driving Nails in My Coffin"" on car radio during a long roadtrip, and nearly drove off the road trying to write down her name. Vincent is a perfect example of the rule that substance always trumps form, whether it's art, music, or literature. I don't really care what you call this type of music. Vincent has a voice that transcends genre or style. Whatever it is, I can't wait to hear more of it!"
4,"Great talent, tight band,,,,","I like this CD a lot and the only reason it falls one star short is that the material is a little uneven and the tunes that aren't really strong are pretty weak. There is some very fine playing, particularly some fiddling by someone named Audie Haynie, and Vincent's voice is solid as always. ""I'm Not Over You"" is a classic honky-tonk heartbreak tune, she more than does justice to Hank Williams' ""Just Somone I Used To Know"", and her harmony with Alison Krauss on "" When The Angels Sing"" is,well, heavenly. I have to say that nobody but Lester Flatt should sing the ""Martha White Flour"" theme, but Rhonda gives it a game effort. Good CD....It'll keep you listening to it for a while."
4,Nice to have her back,"Along with her previous release on Rounder this is just fine high energy bluegrass vocals. She has a crack band, a nice mix of songs and another winner. Hope she's put that Nashville stuff away for a good long while."
4,"Sweet and soulful, but a bit too polished","Rhonda Vincent continues to develop as a bluegrass vocalist with this album. Her performance reflects a growing confidence, and she is backed by excellent musicians. Her singing aims for the soul, and for the most part she meets her target. For example ""I'm not over you"" is a crafty ballad which highlights the passion in her singing. There is also a good mix of bluegrass styles, including the driving Osborne Brothers tune ""Bluegrass express"".At first listen, this is an excellent sweet album. However, after several listenings, I feel that this album suffers from a problem that is all-too-common in recent bluegrass recordings. Like Dolly Parton's recent efforts, it is too polished and overproduced. With all the great musicians playing on the album, they should be given more breadth to express the soul of the music. This is a great example of modern traditional bluegrass, but in the end, will not be a classic recording."
5,Rhonda Vincent: The Storm Still Rages,"This lady has talent! If you enjoy quality Bluegrass sound with a ""touch"" of classic country then you 'll find this album refreshing. It combines excellent vocals with first class musicians. This is my first Rhonda Vincent album and it surely will not be the last!"
3,Mediocre,"This covers age 0-12 in HL Mencken's life. It's composed of light observations and situations of his childhood.For all his fame as a writer and thinker I had expected at minimum an engaging book, if not greatly entertaining and insightful.Sad to say I was really let down - somehow the humor wasn't very witty or humorous, the observations were rather bland, even his descriptions of his daily life weren't very interesting. Really I wonder how such an intelligent person failed to reveal those qualities in this book."
3,Not bad,"The kids (age 3 and 7) like the CD. The adults like the dialog better than the songs. We bought this mainly because the children saw ""Modern Major General"" on one of the videos and thought it was hilarious. We still don't understand why they didn't put the ""Pirates who don't do anything"" song on this CD."
5,Chanson D'amour (Volume 13),"Volume 13 of the terrifically funny comedy, ""Are You Being Served?"" is fust as good as the other 11. This episode features the last five episodes, ""The Hold Up"" which receives 4 out of 5 stars. ""Gambling Fever"" which receives 2 out of 5 stars. ""The Night Club"" which receives 5 out of 5. ""Friends and Neighbours"" which receives 5 out of 5 and ""The Pop Star"" which receives 5 out of 5. These episodes are featured in originally appearance on BBC1 in Britian and the series finale, ""The Pop Star"" , in which the staff perform ""Chanson D'amour"" is a must-see for all AYBS? fans. Although the packaging states the episodes are from 1985, they were actually made in 1984 and shown in 1985. (Just a little something hard-core fans might want to know). I highly recommend this DVD as well as the rest. So buy the Complete Collection (Seasons 1-10) for only $159.99 only on Amazon.com."
5,Are You Being Served Is the best!!!,I think that this is very funny and if you love the others you will really love this one. It has all the laughs you would expect. I love England!
5,Very Good Read,"I was hooked on the book from the prologue until the end. Great character development and vivid imagery. I am very excited to read a second book once written. A great writer which I believe will improve overtime and be a household name. A definite read for anyone interested in science, fantasy, and fiction."
3,Obscure Gems on an Import,"This is one of those CDs you find in an out-of-the-way Mom and Pop CD store (or by searching the web constantly for the obscure track you can't out of your head) Anyway, a lot of the tracks on this CD are pretty oddball-early 90s House and Techno (think back to Nine Inch Nails meets the Red Hot and Dance Compilation back in the day)Strangley enough, this sound suddenly seems ""fresh"" again, after a long lay-off and backlash from grunge. The reason this CD is worth having in your collection are the tracks like Elastic Band's ""Running Up that Hill"" which hit you out on the dance floor and don't let you come back for air until they are resting safely in your CD rack."
3,Do NOT purchase if you plan on this being a SURPRISE or SANTA GIft,"I was VERY disappointed with KBToys, which is who this purchase was connected with through Amazon. Kb's did NOT put these in a brown box, these were sent to us in the original box, with mailing labels stuck all over it, as it went from a courier to the post office to me. The post office had written on the box with big black marker, and there was big labels on the box as well. My kids met the mailman at the mailbox to see if their pen pals had written to them, only to be handed their SANTA GIFTS, in plain site, in original packaging... 2 very happy kids, 1 flustered Mom and one PISSED off Dad... as now we had to start over thinking about what we are going to get them for Christmas... I must say KB's was NO HELP AT ALL, but Amazon made it RIGHT!!!"
1,"too much talking by Rocki, cheesy video","this video has high hopes, but Rocki never quits talking and is so cheesy and annoying, she reminds me of Denise Austin as a wannabe video star, she annoys me to the bone. The moves can be intense. but you have to work too hard to overcome the instruction flaws and poor music. I will be trading this one away."
2,disappointing,"I don't care for this video. Most of the time is spent either listening to Rocki talk or doing kegel exercises, which I can do in the car. There are a few good poses, but it's not enough. I switched back to the yoga tape I was doing before I got pregnant, and I've found my back and hip pains have gone away."
2,A disappointment,"I am not a yoga expert but I have been doing it sporadically for about a year. I already had Shiva Rea's video when I got this and the difference is huge. Shiva has models in each trimester showing the specific modifications you need to make, and she not only shows but tells you how to do them. Everything flows and it's very relaxing. Rocki has lots of variously pregnant women who appear to be doing pretty much the same thing, and her suggestion for modification is ""do what you feel is comfortable,"" which is fine, but not very concrete. I was uncomfortable that she demonstrated downward dog without modifications, since I have heard that your head shouldn't go beneath your waist. I found the repeated kegels boring- a few are fine, but it seemed like half her program focused on kegels. And the leg lifts were not relaxing. She goes too fast and practically counts cadence. I look for stretching and relaxation from yoga and this did not fit the bill."
2,More frustration than relaxation,"If you have never taken yoga before, this is not the video for you. When I found out I was pregnant, I wanted to find an exercise program that I could work around my schedule, and a yoga video seemed to be the perfect fit. However, I found that this video did not give me enough warm up time, nor were the positions explained enough for my non-experienced need. The video moves very quickly, and I found that I was more frustrated than relaxed in trying to keep up. It would have also been helpful to know that I would need a padded mat, foam block and extra blanket for props. The box states that it is ""appropriate for any stage of pregnancy & all fitness levels"", but should add that it is helpful if you have participated in a yoga class before viewing."
2,only for beginners,"I have been doing yoga for a few years now, and was looking for something that was a great workout, yet avoided positions that were beginning to feel uncomfortable or unsafe (like the bow pose, deep twists). I'd consider myself an intermediate at yoga, but this was way too easy. It did show some useful modifications to accomidate my growing belly, but that was the limit of its usefulness. The overabundance of leg lifts and kegels also were annoying. I don't need a yoga tape to do those. (they aren't even yoga moves!). But having sampled several pregnancy yoga workouts (this being the worst one), I have come to the conclusion that no one will endorse a vigorous workout for pregnancy. Maybe they're too afraid of liability, I don't know. Just do your regular yoga routine, don't do anything that puts pressure on your belly, and modify everything else however you can to make it more comfortable. (any yoga DVD can help you with this part)"
2,Disappointing,"I found this video disappointing. If you have bad knees, it is probably not a good idea to use this video because it involves sitting on your bent knees for long periods (painful!). The visual quality of the tape is amateurish (think home-video camera from the '80s) and Rocki is just not very likable (think zero charisma). My recommendation? Save your money."
1,Prenatal Yoga,"I purchased this tape along with Shiva Rea's and I tried it only once in my fourth month of pregnancy. I was fit and regularly incorporated yoga into my fitness routine before pregnancy. This tape has, in my opinion, the potential to lead to injury in at least some women. Poses are not fluid, as they are in Rea's program, and many are sustained excessively long. Despite following several of her modifications, I still managed to irritate a number of ligaments while performing her routine. As a result of my experience, I decided not to use the tape again and have relied on the Shiva Rea tape for pre-natal yoga."
1,"too yoga'ish, not for beginners who anyone new to yoga","i really was frustrated watching and trying to do this video. I have attempted yoga in the past, and sometimes really like it, but this video was too much for me, way off the beaten path. Rocki seemed nice, but doesn't appear to be a solid instructor, i liked my FitMama video alot more, and was happier with it. This video was overbearing and too much yoga'ish stuff for most people."
4,"good workout, calming, enjoyable","i love this video, it is relaxing throughout -- but your body gets a good workout! my only criticism is that it is not clear until you actually view the tape that you will need a blanket, and maybe a block and strap in addition to your mat. but, it's great, and i would heartily recommend it to all pregnant women who are interested in doing yoga!"
5,"Thank you, Rocki.","I purchased this DVD because of the positive reviews that I read, and I was not disappointed. During my first trimester I felt pretty wasted most of the time and therefore got no exercise at all. I'm so thankful that I decided to try this workout now that I'm feeling better. There are some tough poses and stretches but I know it will get easier with practice. I really love Rocki's new age approach to meditation. The spiritual and physical peace you can receive from this experience is extraordinary. The quiet, restful time in this DVD made it the very best choice for me."
4,Unique flavours,"Peter Howard is a name is Australian cooking and lives up to it in this book where he combines truley unique flavours to give a wonderful barbque experience, you can't go past the homemade barbque sauce with the orange-scented meatloaf. The book is laid out easily with a receipe per turn and and the pictures are mouth watering. It makes a great present for the chef extrordinare on the barbque for that little bit of exotic on a Sunday afternoon or just to impress the friends. The receipes are east to follow and easy to read. Give those chicken fajitas a go."
1,Very disappointed,"I wanted to like this product, but in fact I'm very disappointed. As others have noted, you can only remove a row or two at a time - and only if the row of kernels is straight. If the row isn't straight, the ""zipper"" snags. It's also difficult to use because the ear of corn is hot and it's painful to grip the ear and work the zipper. Instead, I'd recommend the ""corn cob cutter slicer stripper knife."" While it isn't perfect, it gets the job done better than with a knife, and without sending part of your dinner all over the table."
4,Good way to strip fresh corn from cob.,"Rather than use canned corn, buy fresh summer corn and strip the kernels from the cob for your recipes. This makes it quick and easy."
1,Corn Zipper,It was difficult to use and overpriced. It is especially hard for anyone having arthritis to control this item. I would not recommend it to anyone!
1,Not worth the effort,We had high hopes for this little device. My in-laws grow and freeze a ton of corn each year and wanted a better way of getting the corn from the cobs. It cuts only one or two rows at a time and was extremely messy to use. Using a good old-fashion knife worked much better and didn't cause a huge mess. Sorry to say but this little device just isn't worth it.
2,Corn stripper,"Very disappointing. Shaving the corn was tricky, difficult and time consuming. Sometimes to close and took too much of the husk and sometimes too little of the kernals. Better off just flossing your teeth after eating. The stripper is now just taking up room in a kitchen drawer."
1,MESSY!,"This utensil is, unfortunately, a waste of money. Removing corn, two rows at a time is far too time consuming. Just use a paring knife for better results. Also, the kernels seem to self-launch resulting in a corn covered counter - what a mess!"
1,A disappointment,"I use raw corn in many of my salads and I looked forward to having a handy device to strip the kernels off the cob. What a disappointment this gadget is! It absolutely mangles the kernels. I'm back to using a knife, which at least produces whole kernels, rather than tearing them up or squashing them."
3,"Works, but is slow","This does a neat, efficient job of removing TWO rows of corn at a time, which means you have to swipe each ear about a dozen times to get all the kernels. That's way too slow for me so I ended up donating this tool. I've been using my beloved Microplane V-slicer (Microplane 47001 Adjustable Slider Food Slicer) and wearing one of those 'Kevlar' gloves to avoid cutting my hand, which works well. While the Microplane method is considerably faster, I don't get all the kernels evenly cut. It's easier than using a knife, but not perfect--I'm still looking for the perfect tool. This cute smiley faced unit is not it unless you are a patient person with time on your hands. It's a good concept and it does a nice job on the two rows, so some folks will like it fine, but I'm looking for something that does more rows in each pass."
4,"Works, mostly","I want to love this product but it's not perfect. However, it's still better than any other way I have found.Very well made (as are all Kuhn-Rikon products) in hefty stainless, with very sharp blades. The blade is about two-kernels wide and strips two rows per stroke. Which is ok, but of course, the varying widths of a kernel guarantees you are slicing through kernels much of the time. Still, beats a knife which always slashes kernels open with every stroke.Best feature: You can generally get it to remove the kernel without leaving much behind or snagging some cob. This is fairly easy to do but not without some struggle to keep it from hanging up mid-stroke.Someday, someone will think of a way to strip kernels off cleanly and wholly. Until then, this is the best."
1,Knife still works better!!,I tried the corn zipper and think that an old fashioned knife still works better. With the Corn Zipper it only cuts one row of corn and a knife you are able to one whole side of the cob and can do it in half the time. Didn't work for me Sorry!!
5,handy gadget,"Finally, no more burning my hands when cutting the corn off the cob! This gadget works effortlessly, and is well made."
2,Sooooo Sloooowwww!!,"I think that I will stick with using a knife. This thing only takes off 2 rows of corn at a time, and it is VERY hard to get started...a little slow process if you have 8 ears of corn! I am a gadget queen, and would like to love every gadget that I invest money into....unfortunately, I cannot love this one!"
1,corn zipper,I was very disappointed in this item. The corn did not zip off the cobb and I tried holding it in every direction. I would not recommend this item. Save your money and buy a sharp knife.
2,Not Happy,Not what expected. I got 3 ears of corn done with a knife before my husband got one done with this product.
4,as described,"Product is as described, and thanks to the other reviewer who converted it in the feet. Thinner then the OEM cable in my car, but I have not noticed any difference in signal. I bought it though to splice a male end onto, an that worked as well."
1,Buy the older stuff this is the worst effort yet.,"If you appreciate the silencers then dont buy this unless you have unlimited cash, and spend like a fool, its poor writing poor engineering silly sounds childish actually,..production makes this a fans only kind of release. The endorsement to buddism is borning and oversells just like recieving did, Jimmy your old and lazy,.. How this can be considered Celtic is streatching pretty far,..the silencers wasnt eeven mentioned this month in the poles for top 100 Scottish bands.. what does that tell you!. if you want a great silencers cd get anything else but Recieving or Come. Very disapointed,.. I will sell mine for what ever i can get for it."
5,AWESOME!!,I absolutely loved this book. Huggin's is an incredible writer and his characters and plot twists kept me riveted the entire time. I can't wait for his next release!
4,Good storyline,"I wish the storyline had went a different way in expanding on the action and wrap up of the main characters redemption. Did not like the woman as one of the main character either. If a woman is included in storylines that are every action filled then it should have been a very minor role.The ending was sad.The main character was strong,fearless and committed but just made you very sad for his plight.I don't think our GOD will be that unmerciful to have him go through all that he has gone through for soo many years of righting a wrong.Really all in all his charcter just made me feel sad for him because he seemed sooo alone in the world."
2,Yeah Huggins Does It Again Alright!!!!,"I can see how pratically a new reader of James Byron Huggins would love this book and think of it as awesome, but after you read his novels the plots are so predictable. Hey huggins, come out with some new ideas please. Any one reading this review I suggest you read either Cain or Rora, both which are masterpieces of art."
3,First Time Huggins Reader,"Pros: Great story, fast paced, 2 out of 10 characters are interesting. Exciting action. The trips back to Calvary make the book very meaningful.Cons: Very poorly written. Choppy and sometimes hard to follow even though the story is very basic. Huggins needs to hire an editor to fix all the mistakes or at least a good friend that'll proof read it first. The many fight scenes get confusing so you have to read them without trying to figure them out, especially the fight in the stairwell. Made my head spin trying to figure out where all the characters were. Many characters are shallow at best and then they just disappear from the story altogether.I'm not sure I'll ever pick up another Huggins book but maybe he's improved since Nightbringer. I sure hope so. I'd hate to see such a good story idea go to waste on such poor writing."
2,Only for Huggins fans,"This is James Byron Huggins' worse book. If you're a Huggins fan, then buy it. However, if you are not, try reading some of his other books such as Cain, Hunter (perhaps his best) or the Reckoning. Huggins is a great author, just as good as James Rollins, but this book seemed rushed and uninspired. Luckily, Huggins just releases Scam and Socerer is coming out soon."
3,Misleading,"The advertised length was 60"".... but the tripod is only 50"". Good solid product, but the advertisement was false! I had to jury rig leg extenders to get the length I needed."
4,??????......????? What's the....,"I do not understand one of the review (Lance's) giving one star, and saying that he didn't watch the DVD....How can you give a note without even watching the show? I saw MA in concert in France, I have most of their albums and concerts and I really think that it's a fabulous band. I recommand it expressivly to anyone who loves progressive rock, celtic music and great music played with deep feelings like Floyd off course also RPWL, MARILLION, and more and more..."
3,Mostly Autumn - Pink Floyd Revisited,"It's an album for those who know any other band's work. Not worth it as first impression, it may erroneously assessed. Worth much to the fans and play songs from Pink Floyd is not easy, since their success and the inevitable comparison. The Mostly Autumn are a band of much value their own work and are of excellent quality. The disc serves to conceptualize this band but something apart. The interpretations of the songs are good, but should not be compared to the originals. It's the best job cover of Pink Floyd songs of those who know. Good!"
1,This is not Pink Floyd,"I did not watch this DVD. It was sold to me as a Pink Floyd DVD, but it is not Pink Floyd. It is ""Mostly Autumn""."
3,Beverage Trucks 1910-1975. Photo Archive.,"Nice short pictorial, but all the pictures are black and white, a good source on beverage trucks and trucks.Wish it would have covered more."
2,Liars,"This product states that it has both front and back seat covers, NO BACK SEAT COVERS WERE INCLUDED. I tried to get a refund on this item but that option isnt even available. On the bright side the front seat covers are great and fit perfectly.It is just really irritating to me that I didn't get what I paid for."
5,"Hands DOWN the BEST salt on the planet, even better than Celtic","This is THE BEST salt I have ever used and I mean this with sincerity. I have tried the Celtic seal salt and I found that it didn't sate as nearly as good as the ""Real Salt."" This is my staple salt and I will not look anywhere else. You will not be disappointed!"
2,natural product,"Read about this in a health magazine, wasn't too crazy about it, kinda grainy. Better when used for cooking and not just for seasoning."
2,"Great taste, but too gritty for eating","I really, really like the taste of this salt, but I have to give it a bad rating b/c there is too much grit in it to eat. There is so much grit it sounds like my teeth are breaking when I eat it. I gave it two stars and not one, however, b/c I do like the taste. It's a very ""salty"" salt. It tastes better than Celtic sea salt, IMHO, and it would be my ""go to"" were it not for the grit.I'll use up this container to lightly salt my water, but I won't buy it again. :-("
3,Freddy Goes Into Politics,"This is one of the earlier Freddy adventures, before Brooks had really hit his stride as a writer. In this book, the barnyard organizes an election and a woodpecker, who is a smooth talker, winds up almost controlling the Bean farm. As usual, there are morals aplenty without being preached at the reader, but, given the 1930s political background of this book (Huey Long and some other major players were obviously in Brooks' mind as he wrote this) I suspect adults will like it more than the kids, although my own children enjoyed it. From another author, this would've gotten at least four stars, but Brooks raises the standard."
3,One story is factually incorrect,It's ok. Not as good as the authors other more famous - Life's little instruction book. One story is factually incorrect - The one regarding Churchill and Fleming.
3,good cheap eating in these dificult times,"This book is just chockerblock full of everything anyone has ever done with an egg. Some of the recipes are quite interesting, and sound good. There is, however, no order to the content, and no index. But, you will get some entertainment, and perhaps some nutritional value from this little book."
2,Poorly laid out,"I downloaded this book because my kids love eggs, and I was thinking there must be more ways to cook them than by frying, boiling, and scrambling.I had hoped this book would help. However, upon opening it, I found it so badly laid out, it took some effort to find where the table of contents ended and the actual body of the book began.Once you get to the recipes, the ingredients are not neatly laid out separately from the instructions. The instructions are written in long sentences separated with semi-colons, in continuous paragraph form, which is very unattractive. There is not a single picture in the book.In the end, we were not inspired to use the book at all."
1,not relevent for cooking today,I found it not relevent for cooking today. It was not helpful. If someone is looking for something historical to learn how cooking and living was it might be helpful.
2,Too soft for nails,"This is nice and soft, which is good for cleaning your hands when they're covered in dirt or grease, but they're far too soft to work out anything from under your fingernails."
5,Great quality!,"I can't imagine parting with this set - ever! The quality is similar to higher end stores, and has stayed that way through several washes. I wash sheets and quilts in hot water, and they don't often hold up - but this set stands the test of hot water and a hot dryer, and it's still huge (too huge for a twin - we had it on a queen and it fit just right).The colors are soft and match the crib sheets we have in the house, I will miss this set when my kids are older..."
5,Know Your Enemies,"I remember reading through the Bible when I was younger, and being confused by the shifting terminology and references to a believer's mortal enemies--spirits, devils, Lucifer, Satan, fallen angels, etc., etc. The author provides powerful, concise and clear definitions of our enemies in the spiritual realm--real creatures with real power to possess human hearts and minds. Hicks traces their origins, their deceitful workings, and their end state. This should rank very highly with Christians everywhere; a great non-fiction companion piece to Professor C.S.Lewis' great (though fictitious) tome, The Screwtape Letters."
2,Can't remember it,"If I can't remember reading it, I can only assume it was not that good. Or, maybe it was never shipped? I have no idea."
4,A good beginning,"Thief of Fire is a first novel, and it is a fine start showing great promise of things to come. It is a good story, well told, with fine character development and a reasonable plot line, logical and realistic, even though it deals with Hollywood characters whose lives are not realistic by the standards of ordinary mortals. Although it has a slow beginning, once into the story it flows easily and quickly.The characters behave and react to plot twists in a fashion that is comfortable for the reader to understand, if not in the way each reader would respond himself. The time span is broad, and the characters behave appropriately as they age, which is not always the case in fiction-writing.I enjoyed the story and found it a pleasant read. I look forward to further works by Ms. Martin."
4,More than just nostalgia...,"It's amazing how everything Wiesel touches turns to gold, and here, he's done it again.The Chassidic masters Wiesel portrays were passionate about Judaism in a way any modern reader can relate to. Wiesel deftly brings that message home time and time again, evoking not only the syrupy nostalgia of most volumes of ""Rebbe stories"", but also a very immediate committment to Jewish life.A masterpiece, this would also make an excellent gift for anyone interested in Jewish spirituality."
5,A well thought out book,"This is personally my favorite of all books on wildlife art. Each of the artists has produced excellent quality work. There are also many surprises, people who I am sure that we will be hearing about more in the future. The format of this book is simple, each artist has written several paragraphs about their work. For the aspiring artist, this information is useful; for the collector like myself, it is very interesting to know more about the artists whose work we collect. I have several other books on this subject, but since I purchased it several months ago, it has been the only one that I have since re-opened."
3,"Fun, but not her best","If one follows Cabaret singers you know the name of Andrea Marcovicci, a singing actress. Some of her work is markedly unique, genuine cultural recreations. With regret I must report that ""If I were A Bell--Songs of Frank Loesser"" is just not her best. She emphasizes Loesser's Tin Pan Alley material and neglects his Musical Comedy work. But I'll keep listening.Ron Mershart"
3,some gold mixed with dross,Some of these songs desrve to be unsung. But then you get a showstopper like Sherry and you wonder how could this show have flopped? That number alone makes this cd worth purchasing.I also enjoyed Marvin Hamlisch's toe tapping title song - Smile.There are also a few other lovely melodies which makes this cd a nice addition to a Broadway collection.
3,Great idea - not Versatile,"The canisters a nice and strong. They keep the food fresh for a long time but... no freezer, no microwave? I'll spend my money on the universal lids and reuse old jars that are freezable."
1,LEAKY CANISTERS,"Contrary to most of the other reviews here, my canisters haven't cracked. That is because I have thrown them away before they received enough usage to crack. Approximately half of the canisters I purchased have leaked. I guess I will have to just stick with the bags."
2,"Good for storage, but doesn't stay sealed","They work OK as standard storage containers, and are a convenient size, but I have repeatedly found that the vacuum ""seal"" doesn't last more than a day or two, so there's no real point to choosing these over any other type of storage container. As a matter of fact, once the seal is gone, it's much easier to accidentally pull the lid off while taking it from the fridge or cupboard, and spill the contents in the process, than with standard Rubbermaid / Tupperware type containers. The rectangular Food Saver containers at least have locking tabs on the sides of the lids to prevent this problem, but don't stay sealed any longer than these do. When you add in the fact that the lids cannot go in the dishwasher and need to be hand washed, they're not worth it. Save your money and buy regular storage containers with a mechanical seal."
1,Every one cracked,"I love the idea. Great idea. But it doesn't work in reality. Of the twelve I bought, every one cracked on the bottom after about three uses. They were pampered, washed by hand, never banged around. Yet each one developed large cracks emanating from the center bottom. I sent the first couple back to Jardens, but gave up after a spell. What a load of junk."
2,Disappointed,"I'm an avid romance novel reader and was sorely disappointed with this, my first and last, Justiss novel. The characters meet a few pages in and for Evan it is love at first sight. The characters are never developed seperately and I found myself completely unmoved and I simply did not care. I was so put off and it stayed with me through the whole novel which took a week to finish istead of a few hours."
3,A difficult book to review,"I can sympathise with with Rachel Cherry but in view of the fact that the book was written 100-150 years ago, I don't think her review is entirely fair. There was no such thing as historical fiction as we know it today. The book is really pure fiction with Julius Caesar as a minor character. The book was written for a less sophisticated reader, probably young adults, than those of today and by our standard it is not very good. By the standards of the nineteenth century who knows. The author did not have the wealth of easy research that is available today. That is why it is difficult to give a rating. It is something like trying to review a silent movie. I found it an interesting read because it demonstrates how far we have come in this genre."
1,Boring and silly,"I was hoping for a great read about a centurion, but this turned out to be a waste of time. This book was boring and silly. I couldn't understand the plot, as the whole silly piece seemed to stress nothing but a glob of words coliding with one another."
4,My 100-word book review,"Supervising the Counsellor is a clearly-written and informative description of the Cyclical Model of counselling supervision; I am new to counselling, but nevertheless found this book to be a fine, solid introduction to supervision. The authors attempt to define what supervision is and isn't; mentoring appears to come closest to their definition. The role varies; inexperienced counsellors may need more guidance, seasoned ones might need a fresh point of view to ward off burn-out (could the opposite also be true?) The authors also cover issues such as potential pitfalls to supervision, the ""ethical inquisitor"" and ""passive optimist"" being unhelpful extremes."
1,Missing the powder and oil!,Product detail said that POWER and OIL were included. Opened the box this morning and found NOTHING... Either they forgot or they misled me. Call Amazon and all they said was to return the item and to get a refund. I mean WTF!!!
4,great combo,"The Femini trimmer rocks! I've never used a trimmer that was so fast and did such a great job all without tearing up my skin! I can use this trimmer on the most sensitive parts and it never pinches or cuts me. I love it!The Cleancut is very good too. Again, I LOVE that it never pinches or cuts me. Other razors, regular and electric, leave me a mess. The cleancut can work in the most sensitive places without any problems. I only gave it a 4 because it was giving me bumps in the beginning. I think I just needed to train my hair to grow in the right direction. Now it keeps everything clean and smooth. I use Bikini Zone after each shave and the bumps are greatly improved.I recommend this combo, I haven't found anything better!"
3,It's ok...,"Works fine but if your hair is really long it can be uncomfortable and it does not completely shave, just shortens... not exactly what I was hoping for but not bad enough to send back. It makes me nervous to use it on sensitive areas and tends to pull hair... but overall it does a quick job when needed"
4,I'm addicted.,"This combination has caused me to become nearly obsessive with staying... maintained. The trimmer is very effective and is just the right size. The shaver is much smaller than I expected, which is actually a plus. The top surface of the cleancut itself is probably not much larger than a quarter, and fits right where you need it to. The sound is a little bit loud, so the people in the next room will probably know when you're tidying up. It doesn't get as close as a razor, but I don't mind that as much as I thought I would because of how little irritation I deal with. It's great to feel so smooth and not have the painful side effects I've been dealing with for so long. For the most part, you'll be able to use the trimmer the first time, then the shaver, and then just run the shaver every other day or so to maintain. It's less than a minute every other day. Very do-able."
4,The Gravity of Sunlight by Rosa Shand,"For those who like fine, poetic writing this novel fills the bill. In some ways I would compare it to The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver - as it is set against a political upheaval in Africa and deals with Americans trying to cope in a foreign land. Another parallel is the religious connection - Shand tells the story of Agnes who is married (sadly) to a Lutheran deacon and teacher who is harsh and unromantic. Agnes lives in a separate world and becomes involved in an affair with a Polish professor and seems rather oblivious to the political upheaval going on all around her. A fine, involving read."
5,Hot & Sensitive: Romantic Tensions in African Setting,"Beautiful and flowing. Rare. Shand is a masterful writer. She captures the universalities of tensions in marriage, yet draws vivid pictures of the disappearing mixtures of subcultures in a Uganda in turmoil a generation ago. The lessons are subtle and still relevant."
3,Beautifully written,"Shand is a wonderful writer. In this book she creates vivid descriptions of the characters, their thoughts and emotions, the environment and its effects on the characters. However, I never connected with the characters and I didn't care about what would to happen to them."
4,a good purchase,"Just being able to hear Pastor Waller solo, is reason enough to get this album. He is a very talented man, and can preach just as well or even better than he can sing. The choir sounds alright, but i always thought they could do better. I don't think their director push them enough. I am a loving member of enon tabernacle, but am also a loving fan of gospel music. This CD is a great start for the tabernacle, and i know that future releases can only be bigger and better."
2,Not for me.,"Joy Division may be considered one of the founding bands of Goth, but I honestly don't see what people found in this. The lyrics, as usual, are drowned out and very difficult to understand and the music and lyrics feel like.. 'varsity garage band does Goth'. Sort of. Granted, I appreciate the blend of dismal pop, but this album just doesn't spark my interest."
2,Immature instrospection,"er,grow up... that's what I want to say to those who rate this album. Unknown Pleasures will come across as immature to almost anyone over 22... if they're being honest. Sensitive naval-gazing doesn't gell with hard-driving rock. Closer is a lot better since the mood and atmospherics match. Unfortunately, this is just one of those albums you look back on as a adult and think ""how can i have liked that?"""
5,Strange,"Does this album have a soul (or lack thereof) of its own? I swear, the more times you listen to it the more it takes on its own personality.Also, now that I've listened to it one-thousand times, I really am starting to like the differnce- yet cohesive force- of each of the songs."
5,Manchester's best band,"I have owned this in album, cassette, and CD form in the last twenty years. It is one of the best CD's to own. Ian Curtis voice sounds like Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights lamenting lost love and life. His voice is haunting, and his tragic early death makes his music more so. If you want to hear something unique and heartfelt, give Joy Division a try."
3,Not quite as advertised,"As a previous review has noted, track #7 (Shadowplay) is NOT the album version, remastered, as are all the other tracks...it is a live version that has been previously released. This means that one of the group's most popular and influential tracks is missing and inexplicably replaced by an inferior live version. If you truly want the 2007 Collector's Edition, you'll need to buy this on CD. Other than that one key track, the rest of the download is fine."
5,uknown pleasures v closer,"Which is the best? Depends on the day i suppose. But if you want to know why the 70`s had The bay City Rollers and the 80`s had The Smiths, buy either. You may think to yourself on first listening... ""that Ian Curtis fellow is a bit of a depressing chap isn`t he"". But by the time either album is entering your cd player for the 4th or 5th time you will be experiencing that buzz of anticipation that only great music can supply."
1,muddy sound on mp3 album,"The sound for this album is really muddy. I know that it's a live album, and an mp3 version of the disk instead of the original, and I'm not a real audiophile if I'm willing to listen to either. That's fine, I'm willing to accept that. But the quality of this is much worse than I'm used to for either mp3s or live albums.(Why does this mp3 album no longer show up when I search for Joy Division & Unknown Pleasures? I could only get to this item by going through my download history. Maybe I'm not the only one who had problems with this?)"
5,One of best rock albums ever recorded,"I know that's an extreme statement. But time distills truth.And the truth is, this album distilled rock into a minimalist art form. Add the shockingly simple but profound lyrics, and this album anniliates pretentious rock. This album can't go out of style, because it was never in style.Dark and foreboding, Unknown Pleasures uncovers too much reality to ever cross over into pop. It's not for the trendies. And that's what makes it monumental. And one of the best rock albums ever recorded."
4,Inferior to Closer,"This record is underproduced (New Dawn Fades, Shadowplay), and overproduced (She's Lost Control). It has an unfinished rawness that may appeal to some, but I think songs like New Dawn Fades are diamonds in the rough. She's Lost Control, with its mediocre mix, is greatly inferior to the Substance version, although that version wouldn't fit on the record.Closer, since it's the greatest ""rock"" album I've heard, makes this one seem regrettable. Songs like Wilderness and Interzone just aren't on the same level. Curtis' vocals on the last track are so mediocre that I can barely listen to it. Instead of that vocal being a deep artistic expression, it seems sloppy.This is a great record (it certainly was unique when it was released), when compared to most of the dross in the music industry, but Closer towers over it."
2,Unknown Pleasures collecters disc,I already owe the STILL & CLOSER cd collecters disc by Joy Division. When I received this disc it did'nt include the outer plastic sleeve with Collectors Edition written on it. Looks like I was sent a used copy. Don't know what could have happened to the sleeve. Would prefer to have it. Was listed as new when I went to buy it. Oh well.
2,I don't get it.,"Like I said, I don't get it. I saw hundreds of 5 star reviews and bought this expecting all this musical genius but it literally just sounds like 4 british guys banging away at their instruments in a garage...Is that the point of this? No, really I want to know. I was expecting something powerful and layered and wonderful after the reviews I read but all 10 songs sound the same and Ian Curtis's singing is totally depressing.And message to critics, just because an album is minimalist and bleak does not make it ""a classic!"". The album cover is the only thing I liked about this."
5,Very good band...,Joy Divison had many good albums. Ian Cutris was very talented. He had a soft depression voice. He wasnt know so much for gothic. When he passed away from depression problems many fans were upset and depressed. He was one of the greastest writers/singers I have ever heard. Love Will Tear Us Apart he looked so sad in the video but he still contined singing. Soon after his death New Order came out..Not as good as Joy Division but many fan of Joy Division loved it. New Order helped us remember Joy Division
5,"2nd best album,milk","Mes love this album,Mes would have to say this is Joy Division's 2nd best album,While it is not as good as ""Closer"" it is still a gem.It has a dark punk element to it,Ian Curtis's dark monotone voice is the perfect sountrack for the haunted castle,he sounds like a gothic Jim Morrissen especialy on the second song""Day of the Lords"".In the Lyrics, Ian Curtis describes his battle with epilepsy and his on going depression because of it.Just listen to the track ""She's lost control"" you will see what I mean.To describe this album Mes say it is a dark,Cold,Punk Album,with introspective lyrics.MILKBABY,AND BABYLAND FOREVER,YAY"
5,One of the best albums ever ...,"Packaged in a stark black sleeve that has very little information aside from the names of the tracks, Unknown Pleasures is an astonishing and often emotionally overwhelming listen. From the driving intro to ""Disorder"" to the smashing glass at the end of ""I Remember Nothing"", Joy Division take the listener buy the hand and give them a glimpse into an unsettling and desolate soundscape that is both foreboding and deeply introspective. The chilling mood created by songs such as ""Day Of The Lords"" and ""New Dawn Fades"" is unique to Joy Division; many bands try to replicate it, yet none have achieved that mood, that feeling.After a listen to Unknown Pleasures, you may never feel the same again."
1,Still needs fixin',"As of February 2009, the wrong version of Shadowplay is still in place. Most likely this is the label's mistake rather than Amazons, but I still wish they'd take it down til it's correct."
2,"It worked, but was a pain","I bought this cable from the seller ""JUNRED"" that claimed their cable was better than the Eforcity Cable. I have bought many cables from Eforcity and this cable from JUNRED was defiantly not better. It was way worse, You have to push the cable very hard to get both sides to click into the PDA so you don't have a random disconnect while syncing.This cable did get me by unit the one I ordered from Eforcity came, then the bad one went into the trash."
5,Celtic music at its best!,"The first time I heard Lunasa was around St. Patrick's Day; my dad bought tickets to see them. Almost instantly, I was caught up in the rich harmonies coming from the stage. The music can fill you with such feeling. It sends messages: about sadness, happiness, or just having fun! Songs such as Inion Ni Scannlain is beautiful; it lifts you up. And Morning Nightcap is quite a toe-tapper! These musicians truly know how to play good music."
2,Disappointed with its manufacturer origin....,"My mug for 8 years has recently broken, and I wanted to buy a new mug to replace the broken one. I am very picky with what I use to eat and drink, especially when it comes to their manufacturer origin. I have Corelle dishware sets at home and they are all Made in USA, so I figured this mug would be Made in USA, too.I was so excited when I received the mug, but as I opened the wrapper to get to the mug, I found out it's Made in China. I was disappointed.... I wish there is a way for me to find out where the mug was made in before I purchased it.I would give this item 1-star, but since the design of this mug is nice looking, I decided to give it a 2-star.Now this mug is just sitting on my desk as a pens/pencils holder..."
2,An Elegy to Alcoholism,"While I very much appreciate the review already on this site, I cannot give credit to this film that statement entails. Two very talented actors, one very flat, selfish and deluded poem. It could be titled: ""How I Met My Ex and Got Drunk - for Lunch."" The poem feeding the drama evokes the pathetic wish that the copy editor, played by Mr. Rickman, could somehow have had a different life or resurrected the old one by simply showing up. Being rude, drinking to excess, insulting his former lover, played by Emma Thompson, is all deluded excess this poor character thinks will win him back some semblance of a life better than he has. It is all very depressing and not very original. It is also very whiney and tedious."
2,Not one of Horner's best and of course not ORIGINAL,"Windtalkers had a chance to be such a good score. But thanks to James Horner's penchant for repeating himself, it's not. His Marine theme is enjoyable and the use of Native American chants is ok, but overall he simply redoes previous music. There's a bit of Enemy at the Gates and Mask of Zorro in this score. And he's not done reusing it, in Troy he uses some od the same music. If you are a hardcore Horner fan, buy this cd. If you don't mind the fact that it is repetative music, buy this score. Otherwise, stay away."
1,I WAS ROBBED!,"Maybe I should have thrown my money into the wind. Haven't seen the movie yet, but all the commercials on the radio with the beautiful American Indian music, it's what I EXPECTED on this CD and was really mad that none of it was included even tho that was the main theme of this movie. Thanks for nothing. Unfortunately I don't have a sound card on this computer and couldn't listen to any samples but I bought the CD anyway, just blindly assuming that the beautiful American Indian music would be there. Instead, I get a CD full of tired, boring, military music and military drum rolls we've all heard before. I took this CD that I got today and tossed it into the wind...."
4,Enemy at the Gates+ orchestrated Thunderheart,"Horner fans should get the picture quickly with my title.Good quality Horner score that makes an excellent companion piece to his awesome Enemy at the Gates score. Yes, parts sound simillar, but there is also a more ethnic feel to this score.If you know Horner's work and like it, than you won't go wrong here, either."
3,I thought Robbie Robertson was supposed to be on this...,"Did anyone else notice that a Robbie Robertson song is used in the trailer for this movie? This soundtrack is nice, not a blockbuster but worth listening..."
4,Gorilla Lug nuts,"I suggest not using a impact on these if you want the chrome to stay on, but for the price they are a good choice."
1,Pass on these if you live where it snows!,"I purchased these for my '02 Liberty Renegade to swap out the garbage stock MOPAR/Jeep two-piece nuts. Sure, they look great when you put them on, but I am writing this in late December after about 4-6 weeks (at most) of snowfall here in WI and the subsequent salt wash that ensues. These things are already rusting like crazy! I only put them on earlier this year in mid-late summer, so this is the first winter they have seen, and the ONLY one they will see. I am now going to swap these things out ASAP in the spring. Save your money if you are in a northern climate."
4,Slick Pulla brought Jeezy down to 4 stars,Even though Jeezy said Lets get it will be his worst album this one was good but not quite as hot. Slick Pulla is trash and blood raw brings down the value of this mixtape. Jeezy needs to start writing for these guys. Thats why we all loved Lets get it cause it was just him with help of Bun TI and Lil scrappy all above average rappers
2,Dis cant be Jeezyyyyy,R u serious? Jeezy gettin mo and mo commercial every song. he dun got outta hand with them adlibs. Da A takin notes. He dun hated so bad and now people dun started hating on him. I give him til bout september to get back to the old Jeezy before he fall off. REAL TALK!!!!
2,This is boring,"Sounds like the ""Latin Demo"" setting on a drum machine played over and over. The title is misleading; there is noting remotely cosmic or even funky about these tunes. The Quango label has had some great releases, but this is not among them."
5,Great Collection--Sweet Thursday at last!,"I have been looking for Johnny Mathis's song Sweet Thursday for years. It was on his vinyl album JOHNNY'S NEWEST HITS from 1964, but it has never before been on CD. Now it is! For that song alone, I've given this collection five stars. Nearly all of his best stuff from that period is also on this CD. Do yourself a favor, listen to the clip of Sweet Thursday and then see if you can resist buying the CD."
2,Not what I expected,"Although some of the tracks were known to me, I assumed that when I heard the others, I would know them or they would be somewhat familiar.They weren't. I don't think these were the ""best"" selections for him. My expectation was not what it should have been.And, after seeing him in person with a full orchestra, there is no experience that a CD can bring."
5,One of the BEST pans around!,"I've had 2 Swiss Diamond fry pans for several years and even with a husband who uses metal utensils on them nearly every day for eggs, they are still in perfect shape. I prefer to wash my pans by hand, but they've made a few trips through the dishwasher without any harm. When I needed a 2 qt. saucepan, Swiss Diamond was my choice. It is easy to handle, not too heavy, sits flat on the stove top, and is also very quick to wash. No complaints!"
4,"Excellent product, very expensive","This pot is very nice to use, feels good in your hands, just not sure it is worth the extra cost."
4,Very Good and Thought Provoking,"It is so clear that the liberal media and science is lying to us to cover up the existence of God. This movie will help you see the side that science, media, and society as a whole doesn't let you see."
2,"Decent point, unbalanced presentation","The film's thesis seems to be that the scientific community should not kill debate surrounding intelligent design. Fair enough. The trouble was that I could not walk away believing that the scientific community is killing debate because the filmmakers did not make their case with any attempt at balance or sobriety. Had this been done, the film may have been a great deal more effective. As it stands, it's simply another voice yelling loudly among others. This did not add to debate or conversation, but surely made the idea of debating the merits of intelligent design a great deal less palatable to the powers that be. I'm sure the filmmakers lined their pockets nicely, though."
5,Better than National Geographic or Discovery Channel,"There are two sides to every story, and Expelled takes its audience on a very serious journey where so called empirical evidence actually raises more doubt in the scientific community than Intelligent Design or Creation platforms. This is on of the best modern films that offers the best apologetic in terms of evidence for Intelligent Design. How can one be truly educated if he or she cannot be free to examine all evidence for their own benefit and share that evidence with others? Should we all be expelled from school just for modeling academic freedom?As for the main character, Ben Stein, I raise my glass to him for showing that smart people can have a sense of humor and that you don't need a Ph.D to understand that wrong is wrong, don't force something to be right. The scientific community, for many years, has set Evolution up as the default answer,...the joke is on them! Great film!"
2,"Not a ""Best Buy"" from my point of view, but ...","I thought this was a disappointing presentation and was not really worth the hype it was originally given when it was released. I was left with the feeling that although this topic is deserving of a good debate with people who were willing to provide their deep knowledge as to why they feel and think how they do, they do not do that on this DVD - in my opinion the general level of debate was superficial!I cannot help but comment that National Geographic and Nova productions cover this sort of subject in greater detail and with greater understanding being given to their viewers.But then again, Ben Stein is a comedian and I guess his sense of humor shines through this DVD."
1,A Shill for Bible Literalists,"A documentary used to make superstitious people feel good about themselves by attacking science. Science is a method for establishing criteria for knowing the universe based upon evidence, prediction, and verification. But for these people, it's an affront to their religion which makes grand unverifiable claims."
1,Flawed Execution of Flawed Ideas,"Expelled fails to grasp the basic concept of the scientific method, and by misrepresenting ideas, the movie quickly snowballs into something that would have easily received five stars.If it was a parody."
1,Not worth watching...,"I want 98 minutes of my life back... Forget whether there should be an argument, intelligent design is a stupid argument, and Expelled is a rather transparent documentary. It's clear from the start (literally, the first sentence in the movie) that Ben Stein has a religious agenda. He tries to make the viewer believe he is objective or even pro-evolution and then gets convinced of intelligent design... Nonsense. For the record, evolution is true. Natural selection is one of the ways it could have happened. The latter point is only somewhat controverted in the scientific establishment, the first one is not."
1,Highly Skewed Documentary,"I won't address the whole evolution versus intelligent design debate, but I will say this: this documentary is highly biased, and not in a good way. Evolutionary concepts are grossly mishandled by the filmmakers, quotes from biologists are taken out of context, statements are made only addressing the pros without the cons on their behalf, and so on. Even Ben Stein, who has little to no background in any of the fields of specialty, is heard in the form of voiceover dismissing and roasting every heavily edited video clip of someone from the opposing viewpoint.I would not have minded this movie had it showed both sides or at least gave cons with the pros to the intelligent design side, yet the filmmakers have failed to do so, instead making a very biased and intellectually insulting documentary that just serves to further confuse those who are curious about the debate."
5,Expelled is fabulous and here's why....,"The fact that Ben Stein is not an evangelical Christian totally confirms the credibility of this movie. Not because evangelical Christians are not credible (I'm one) but because the progressive liberals don't have that tag to throw at it and immediately discredit it as Christian rhetoric or propaganda.I went into it very cautious about how it would be presented and came out thrilled with the outcome. The scientists who are questioning Darwinian evolution are SMART, not just mind-numbed robotons who repeat what some in the scientific community have (mindlessly) repeated for years. You can not look at all the disparities in the evolutionary theory and not question it. There are too many unanswered, untestable, unobservable issues to just accept it. This movie provides great, thoughtful, intelligent information about these disparities. It was absolutely great."
5,"A very cogent & intelligent critique of the ""Evolution"" establishment.","I found this documentary to be very informative and very fair in it's critique. The conclusions that were drawn were fair and very plausible. There is NO logical reason as to why Intelligent Design should/could not be taught side by side with evolution. The only reason I came away with for not doing it was because ID is considered ""ridiculous"" and would eventually point to the ""possibility"" that a greater power, God, could be responsible for all that we see, including ourselves. And this, given the fact that ID has as much, If not more, scientific evidence in it's support than evolution has in it's defense. I strongly suggest those of you who are more open minded than the current academic intelligentsia to view this documentary for yourselves and draw your own conclusions."
5,Exposes the growing consensus that Darwin's Theory of Evolution is outdated,"A must see for any open minded & well educated person. The film debates Darwinism, Neo Darwinism, and Intelligent Design. The movie is objective (unlike most Hollywood material), thought provoking, intellectually stimulating, and witty. Superbly produced and polished documentary. This film exposes the facts and new data proving that Darwin's theory is obsolete and flimsy."
1,Awful Propoganda,"What could I possibly say that hasn't been said at expelledexposed.com? I saw the movie, and it was terrible. I actually laughed out loud. Twice.Perhaps most offensive is the darwin -> atheism -> eugenics -> holocaust line he draws. What an extraordinary revision of history: http://www.nobeliefs.com/nazis.htm"
1,Very poor,"This movie is full of logical fallacies and fails to prove its thesis. In addition, it's a complete bore. Ben Stein narrating is the only redeeming quality and only because it brings flashbacks of Ferris Beuler. Not worth it! Don't buy!"
1,I can't wait for this to go on sale used!,"Once the used DVDs hit the market, I'll start looking. I'll wait until it falls under a dollar, and get it then.Perhaps I'll get lucky and find it in the Wal-Mart discard bin, under a copy of ""Battlefield Earth"". Or maybe it will turn up in the local Salvation Army next to all the discarded Rush Limbaugh and Anne Coulter books.And then it'll go on my shelf right next to ""Santa Claus vs. The Martians"" and all my other really bad fiction."
1,"Distortions, stupidity and outright lies","Refutations of the distortions and lies in this piece of junk are widely available on the net, especially YouTube. Educate yourself."
4,Great Info for the Layperson; not so much for Experts,"for someone who is new to this subject and not very well read on the subject of Creation/Evolution, this is an excellent intro to the whole issue. Stein exposes the dictatorial fascism of the Darwinian cabal with stealth and wit. However, the piece does not delve very deeply into issues such as the origin of the matter, time, space, and the universe, nor does it endorse religion, which is probably a good idea since this is marketed to a mass audience. MUST SEE"
5,Imagine that!,"I just finished watching Ben Stein's ""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed."" Finally, several intelligent scientists have exposed the true agenda of those who support the Darwinian theory of evolution. Why are Darwinians so adamant that people who support the theory of intelligent design are ""stupid""? We live in a country (U.S.A.) founded on the principle of free speech, so why do Darwinians fight to suppress this debate in the public schools? In my humble, ""stupid"" opinion I believe they are afraid they may learn something. Imagine that!"
1,"Horrible, but didn't cost a dime","I gave my $7 to Horton Hears a Who instead of actually paying for this one. Turns out that was almost a mistake, since I was the only one in the theater come showtime, and without any paying customers, the projectioner almost didn't start the movie. It was a scientific farce, but on top of that, it was the most bored I've ever been in a theater. The only reason I stayed to the end was so the next time a creationist asks me ""Have you seen it,"" I can answer ""yes."""
1,Poorly Produced,Do any research before or after you watch this movie and you will find how dishonest the producers are. This movie is shameful (and so is Ben Stien's part in it).
1,Research on your own,"Expelled is so fallacious and manipulative that I felt insulted after watching it. All I can say is that if you don't see through the complete lack of arguments, inconsistency and appeals to irrational emotion, just read the wikipedia pages for Intelligent Design and Expelled.Freedom of inquiry in science does not require scientists to accept every crackpot non-scientific theory cooked up by a right wing think tank (which is exactly what ID is. Again, do a bit of research). The reason Expelled makes no real arguments about why ID is science is because there are no arguments to be made! The reason scientists act as if the debate about evolution has been settled is that it has!ID is fine for philosophy classes and such, but it's not science because it isn't empirically testable, isn't falisfiable, hasn't produced any productive research, etc. There's no vast conspiracy of scientists, the media and atheists that is keeping ID out of science. It does that on its own."
1,Awful!,"Doesn't even pretend to be objective. Piece of trash..Do yourself a favor, go clean out your sock drawer instead at least that's time well spent."
1,From an outsider,"I have no opinion one way or the other going into this. I was told it was great science and that it was a sham. Read the reviews here for those opinions.I personally think it was made as a comedy, and failed miserably as it is not funny."
1,Fundamentally Dishonest,"Expelled tries to make a case that scientists are unfairly having their careers cut short due to their biblical-literalist beliefs, but the ""evidence"" they present is very one-sided (they never even consider the possibility that the scientists were incompetent as well). Also, one of the scientists wasn't even employed at the job he was supposedly fired from. You can check the Expelled Exposed website to confirm this. There's no nice way to put it: Ben Stein lies."
1,Disgusting,"The analogies of the scientific community to the Holocaust when dealing with intelligent design are insulting to the millions of Jews, Gypsies, Blacks, homosexuals, Jehovah's witnesses, soldiers, and others who perished under the Holocaust. But nonetheless, this doesn't stop Ben Stein from touting his exploitation of a horrible human atrocity in history to push his conspiratorial polemic with his Discovery Institute cronies who fail to even explain the methodology of Intelligent Design. The punchline of this movie is that there is no scientific methodology, but it is perfectly okay to hold a scientific position at a University and lazily wax on the power of sky fairies and Unicorns."
1,Would give it a 0 if Amazon had that option,"There's a reason that this lost money in the theaters. There is a reason it will lose money in any format sold. It is a ""mocumentary"" and an affront to anyone who has a brain they utilize. It is grotesque; an insult to anyone of any religious belief. The authors of this film assume that I or anyone else have not studied history. The authors assume we are incapable of critical thinking and reasoning. This film proves one thing only, that Ben Stein is a sad old man who never learned to think for himself. I have nothing but pity for him."
4,Very Introductory,"An excellent movie by Stein, but very basic. He covers very quickly only a fraction of the many serious logical and scientific problems with Darwinian theory. For a far more detailed look I highly recommend ""The Biblical Basis of Modern Science"" by Henry Morris. Stein goes on to show the obvious historical link between Darwinism and Atheism, Moral Relativity, and Eugenics in Nazi Germany as well in the US (planned parenthood, Margarete Sanger). Over all, a great but very simple movie; it is excellent as an introduction to those who have not been exposed to these ideas before, but critical thinkers will want more. Still, this movie would be a great gift for anyone who is not Intellectually Comatose.""The ability to entertain an idea without subscribing to it is the mark of an educated mind"" - Aristotle."
1,Simply Zero Substance as an argument for Intelligent Design,"Reading the reviews for this movie there seems to be no one pointing out on either side that there is not only no fact supported in this film, there isn't even any claims!!Stein argues that the Intelligent Design ideas are not being taken seriously in the academic world, but he makes NO attempt to prove to us that there is ANY validity in the claim.I agree that no idea should be ""expelled"" if there is merit to it, but does Stein even make any attempt to show us the merit of Intelligent Design? The scientists that were ""expelled"" for their points and research didn't even make their argument for Intelligent Design."
1,Drivel..Terrible Documentary,Ben Stein should have to return any university degrees that he's been give to publish such unscientific drivel.Save your time/money--don't bother with this film.
5,Brilliant exposure,Great information and interviews. My biggest problem was it wouldn't play on my DVD - I had to sit in my computer room to watch it.
5,Thought provoking and humorous,"This is a thought provoking and humorous documentary showing how just allowing for the possibility of Intelligent Design will get you ostracized or worse in modern academic and scientific circles. It shows how adherents of the current prevailing dogma of unguided Darwinian Evolution will grasp any straw to hang on to their beliefs despite the evidence (one even explains that life on Earth might have been started by space aliens while denying any possibility that it could have been started by God). Yes it has gotten that bad in the world of academia and so-called science.Stein also brings to light how Darwinian Evolution influenced the Nazis and was used by them to justify the slaughter of millions of supposedly ""less evolved"" groups such as Jews. Ideas have consequences and they are not always good.This should be shown in every high school and college campus in America, no the whole world."
1,"""Expelled"": No intelligence in this movie","Shoddy research, false claims, and BORING presentation. You'd think this was a parody meant to lampoon the ""Intelligent Design"" movement, but believe it or not, it's an incredibly inept effort to promote ID.Scientists are understandably angered by this movie's charlatanism; ID proponents should be outraged as well, for its portrayal of them as buffoons unable to follow the simplest of logic.Meanwhile, you'll be upset too if you find you've wasted money on this lazy, half-baked, boring bit of dreck. Pass on it and get a real movie."
1,Propagandistic trash,The producers went around lying to people about the topic of their movie in order to get interviews. They subsequently expelled anyone from their screenings that they didn't like. Anyone with a functioning mind can see right through this propagandistic drivel.
1,Lies: Now in a convenient disc format,"By all means, buy this. Nothing could undermine the credibility of the Intelligent Design crowd faster than this dishonest, venal attempt to make an end run around the legitimate scientific vetting process. [...]"
1,90 minutes of your life you will never get back,"Pure and utter propoganda. Not once during the entire content of this movie is there any mention of evidence to support the 'Intelligent Design' hypothesis. The whole film is dedicated to exposing perceived prejudice against those that wish to espouse ID as an alternative to the Theory of Evolution and yet no-one seems able to explain what the strengths of ID are. Ben Stein's attempt to link the Holocaust to Darwin is simply shameful, the disingenousness of producers whilst interviewing participants has been widely reported across the internet and everyone but the most religiously biased individuals understand that Intelligent Design is nothing more than a long line of efforts to promote Biblical creationism.In short, this movie does exactly the opposite of what it intended. It merely exposes Intelligent Design advocates as the fundamentalist nutcases that they really are. Ben Stein should hang his head in shame."
1,Expelled: no intelligence demonstrated,"This little piece of religious propaganda is only another reason why fundamentalist christianity needs to be checked in our society.Intelligent Design is a complete sham, it's creationism and a conservative judge has ruled it as such. However, if you get a droll former nixon speechwriter to use the holocaust and outdated definitions of a very powerful scientific theory to make ad hominem attacks on men of science, all of a sudden ID becomes a relevant theory? Sorry, in any logic class this would fail.Not to mention the filmography isn't particularly high caliber either."
1,"Great teaching aid, but not in the way Ben Stein intended...","I teach a class that includes logic and logical fallacies. This film is a wonderful teaching tool for me. From start to finish, it is a buffet of logical fallacies. My students are justifiably appalled at the film's obvious weaknesses, such as the film maker's failure to ever provide a single piece of evidence to support the case of intelligent design. The ad hominem association of evolution with the Nazi genocide is so over-the-top that it actually made my students, religious kids included, angry. Thank you, Ben Stein, for making a film so riddled with ignorance of science and fallacious claims -- you have unwittingly helped today's young people to be more vigilant in their examination of claims such as yours!On a personal note, I regret that I had to actually buy this film to use it as a teaching tool. Spending my own money on such laughable propaganda was painful, even when it serves my students well as a negative example!"
4,Expelled or exposed,"An enjoyable, interesting and somewhat alarming look at our higher education system. Our family watched this together and it sparked hours of lively conversations."
1,Warning to Ben Stein Fans,"This is not a Ben Stein entertainment film, this is creationist religious propaganda.It's likely no one's mind is going to be changed by these weak arguments. The evil thing here is that it's masquerading as something it's not, just like most of the arguments by creationists masquerading as ""creation scientists"" or ""intelligent design"" devotees."
4,Scholastic learning censored,"This video has great relevance on how bias professor and administrator are influencing our school system. One sided opinions who are aggressively try to shut out people of faith, or even people of opposing thought to evolution, with strong reason to question Darwin theory. Ben Stien present this movie almost like a documentary, yet very entertaining."
1,When will the IDiots learn...,"...that ID is NOT science, and will never pass as science for anyone with half a brain left (which makes me wonder exactly how much brain Stein has left after this horrible 'documentary'. Go back to thumping your bibles, spewing forth hatred and bigotry - at least that was HONEST stupidity. ID is, in essence, DISHONEST stupidity."
1,Bad all around,"From the monotonous presentation from Stein, to the blatant ""Quote mining on tape"". All in all, give this a pass."
1,What A Load Of Cobblers,"Dreadful, nasty, anti-intelligence.It purports to be a documentary but is in fact a piece of political and religous propaganda.It died on release and this is the rather smelly corpse."
1,"Horrible ""documentary""","This documentary doesn't even attempt to have any sort of balanced view on ""Intelligent Design"" versus Evolution. It starts with the premise that the theory of evolution is wrong and that there is a conspiracy by left-winged scientists to stifle cynicism and doubt towards that theory, while simultaneously shutting out ID from the mainstream. If it isn't obvious to everyone that ID is the latest way of religious zealots to say ""God did it,"" I don't know what is."
5,Fascinating Information,"I thought the film was interesting and relatively well put together. BUT, I haven't had time to do all of the research to validate or verify what this documentary reveals, but if half true - which I am confident it is because I work in Higher Ed. albeit, as a staff member - then our nation is truly moving away from faith in a God to a more secular, atheistic, purely naturalistic philosophical approach to life and anyone with any kind of faith or belief in the supernatural, no matter how reasonable, will be forced to practice and express their belief in secret i.e. atheist and secularist would say ""private"". Obviously, the film had a message which people either strongly agree with or strongly oppose. This issue is this: is it true?"
4,expelled,Entertaining and very good facts to prove there is intelligent Design. The Lord of Heaven and EarthBalance of both points of view
5,Made me decide to research on my own,"Since being inculcated in evolution theory for 16 years of formal education, I accepted it as truth. After seeing this film I decided to examine the evidence for myself. I found there is compelling scientific evidence for intelligent design. The matter should no longer be relegated to status as a ""social issue."" It is a scientific issue and should be studied and debated openly. It is foolish to continue to dismiss the intelligent design argument as merely religious. Look at the evidence for yourself. A thinking person cannot see it and deny that it does have merit."
1,"If it weren't serious, it would be funny","Aside from the blatant lies about science and scientists presented as fact within this (and I use the term loosely) documentary, Stein and his crew also misled the interviewees about the nature of their movie. Beyond all this, Stein removed any references the scientists made to themselves being Christians, instead painting them as Atheists."
4,Love Ben Stein. Great deal of research went into this!,"This video is extremely interesting, but a tad long for my attention span. It held my attention for an hour, but then I wandered. A great video for anyone who questions Creation versus evolution!"
1,I wish there was a zero star rating,"What a waste of time and money. Unbelievable poor ""science"" and so full of cheap tricks it is embarrassing. Shame on them all."
4,Pretty Good Overall,"I just watched the movie and felt that it was good representation of whats going on in our liberal ""anything goes"" except to doubt scientific theories by Darwin society. I teach science in a high school and present the students with all views rather than say Darwins is right and here are the other stupid beliefs by the way. Students need to realize that it is the theory of evolution and not the law of evolution...A theory is an idea without 100% backing by the scientific community. Creation is also a theory.....Free speech is a law(fact) yet it looks like people who fire people because of their ideas are the real morons that some of you speak of in these reviews. No matter what your belief, let people make up their own mind based upon information they assimilate rather than preach a theory as a fact."
1,This is the worst piece of cr@p I have ever seen,"I couldn't give this review a lower rating than 1 star. If I could I would go into negative territory.Man this film is horrendous. It's like watching a train wreck on an instant reply loop. Ben Stein tries to be impartial and insinuate on how there is some sort of higher secret society power squashing the theory of ""intelligent design"" by ""expelling"" professors from schools who even mention it during class. Ben Stein, get real and start looking for a real job."
1,An overpriced frisbee.,"Never before has a movie lived up to its name so completely. It is clear that intelligence was not allowed in the making of this dangerous piece of propaganda, and was, in fact, expelled."
1,neit working,"well i can not comment much here, the dvd did not play on my dvd player nor on computer.however, i respect the ID theory because it is a science yield to uitimate truth, that there is a god and he created every thing.it is so sad that the ID theory lost the case in high court to be taught in schools, actually i see the real loosers are the students who will be taught only evolution theoy.i hate when people say, do not read this or that, we all have to listen to each other no matter how much difference there is.i would recommend to read this good book ""Science and Evidence for Design in the Universe""."
1,Intellectually dishonest; outright lies,"This movie is intellectually dishonest, and presents outright lies as fact. There are numerous sites on the internet dedicated to explaining all this, chief among them http://www.expelledexposed.com/. Please, let's let science and religion be separate. No need to teach religion and science together in a classroom. Religion already has its place - Sunday school."
1,"Lies, Damn Lies, and Ben Stein",The only review necessary for this dishonest dreck is to refer anyone who hasn't heard of the lies of Mark Mathis and Ben Stein to http://www.expelledexposed.com for the facts behind this disingenuously conceived and poorly executed pathetic piece of propaganda.
1,Ideology is like halitosis--it is what the other fellow has,"Staring Ben Stein in eXpelled""I love this movie!"" Ben SteinWhat an asshat!!. . .IDiots...Do you believe there is variation within populations?Do you believe some of these variants are better at surviving then others?Do you believe there is heredity between generations?Congratulations, you believe in evolution! Get it through your thick skulls already."
5,Dont be ignorant please,"Do yourself a favor and go see this. Ben Stein is brilliant. I admire his courage for making a documentary such as this in our day and age. It has nothing to do with religious bias, it merely presents the current fued within the science community that we should all be aware of."
1,Condescending film doesn't support its own arguments,"A long held tradition on the side of those with lots of emotion and little to say has been to insult the other side. Here you find more than an hour of laborious, droning, brow-beating insults to the mountains of evidence science has provided for a model of the universe that does not need an intelligent creator. Meanwhile, the film does nothing to support its own claims that an alternative argument has any merit at all.Be not fooled; when it's not making false conflations and comparing anything and everything to Hitler's regime (Ben, you should be ashamed of yourself for belittling the suffering of millions so you can turn a buck and pander to those who mock education!), it's clobbering you with clumsy imagery and ad-hominems.Spare yourself suffering, cost and loss of time. There are much better ways to hear the weak arguments against a material universe."
4,liked it,"I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary. of course, there are negative reviews, because it happens to be a doc that's slanted towards ID. I mean, are people surprised when they saw this? watch for yourself."
1,Lying for christ,"They lied to get scientists involved...They lied about people loosing their jobs...I didn't know christianity allowed so much lying.a simple web search was all it took to blast this sham of a ""documentary"" apart."
1,Ironically Ben Stein and hitler have something in common,"They are both creationists who hate the work of Darwin. Intelligent Design is creationism and the Nazi's banned the work of Darwin, Ben stein doesn't know what he is talking about because he has never read mein campf or origin of species, he is drawing a link between two things he doesn't know about. The ID movement is intellectually sloppy and that is why they aren't allowed in, they don't want to go through the normal process, they haven't even tried. They haven't been expelled they just never filled out the application. That and they totally ripped off the XVIVO inner working of a cell video, with out a doubt it is impossible that they got to the same place on their own."
1,abject ignorance disguised as wit,"Ben's thesis is laughable - I recommend this film for people who believe the label ""intellectual"" is an insult."
1,propaganda`,There are so many factual errors in this video as well as misconstrued interviews where scientists have disavowed the way they were used... avoid it!
1,18 Dollar Cup Holder,"If you want an 18 dollar cup holder, by all means buy this dvd.Filled to the brim with lies and intellectual dishonesty. I can't believe who ever produced this film gave it a green light.No intelligence allowed--Absolutely right!"
5,expelled,"A must see. We had to drive to NV to see it, they would not show it in Utah for some reason!"
5,Powerful and Positive,"As its harshest critics claim, it's a documentary with an agenda. Maybe you could even call it propoganda, but ""propoganda"" doesn't necessarily mean ""false."" The movie is in turns serious and funny and serious, with a powerful emotional appeal at the end.It uses the Berlin Wall as a metaphor of the artificial barrier that most of the science and academic orthodoxy have imposed against any serious consideration of evidence for an intelligent agent as the source of life on earth. Although maligned as religious creationism, the idea of Intelligent Design is shown to be worthy of at least some serious attention. The arrogant bias of those who would censor it, and who have censored it, is proudly exposed by their own, unedited words.""Expelled"" is an excellent production that deserves wider publicity."
1,Apparently No Video Allowed Either,I really can't say if I liked it or not since it won't play - I have tried it on 4 different DVD players and see 'disc error' then completely blank screen.
1,shame on pseudoscience!,"Religious baloney masquerading as science. Don't be fooled. Well-known skeptic Richard Dawkin's name was put on this movie without his permission to make it seem like a balanced, thoughtful perspective."
1,What a terrible movie,"This is a terrible movie, don't waste your time or money. Full of lies and inaccuracies, don't trust anything said in this movie without your own research. Also, poorly made with cheezy clips of old black and white movies to beat you over the head with their ham-handed points. It tries imply that teaching evolution leads to Nazi concentration camps! No kidding!"
1,shsmeless,"This movie is completely shameless in its distortions, misrepresentations and outright lies. Could only be embraced by conservative christian fundamentalists."
1,"This ""Documentry"" is a joke!",Ben Stein does not live in reality! He thinks the earth is 6000 years old and wants to spread lies about science. Don't waste your time or money on this.
1,Nothing but propaganda,"Don't waste your time. It's nothing more than a thinly veiled propaganda piece for putting creationism in the classroom, or at least on par with evolution and other actual scientific theories. If you want to teach creationism, fine, but do it in a religion class along side other creation myths, but don't dare put in a science class -- nothing in creationism/ID holds up to the most basic of scientific scrutiny."
5,"Very powerful, a must see.","This is not a documentary about scientific arguments against evolutionism, rather, is a pressupositionalist style work intending to show the viewers theres no conflict between science and religion.If you are familiar with apologetics, you already know (or at least you should!) the conflict is actually between physicalism and theism/deism. Problem is: physicalism adherents tergiverse their worldview as ""science"", and since they control the media and academia, they are not letting it go away, so they crush the opposition pretty hardly (they prefer prestige than truth by the way)."
1,"Perhaps not *pure* trash, but...","Well, it's probably beating a dead horse, but this movie, while interesting and somewhat engaging, is simply too biased and full of half-truths,untruths, and misleading statements to be seriously considered as anything but entertainment. The fundamental ideas of the film -- that scientific theories opposed to Darwin are ""expelled"" from the establishment, that ID is one such theory, that belief in evolution leads to eugenics and totalitarianism -- are of course utterly wrong, but that's been covered so thoroughly in other websites that there's no point in going into it here. If you do decide to watch it, I highly recommend pairing it with the excellent Nova episode,Judgment Day - Intelligent Design on Trialabout the famous Dover, PA trial in which the judge determined that ""Intelligent Design"" was simply religious creationism in secular clothing."
3,1 or 5 stars depends on your perspective,"Interesting that most reviews were either 1 or 5 stars. I haven't seen it because no theatre in my area would show it. I do plan to rent it unless the video stores boycott it also. Funny, the movie had ""bad"" reviews before it even came out. Makes you wonder were all the anti-creationist venom comes from. Its gotta be a must see."
3,Grade C,"I liked what he had to say, but in my opinion I thought he looked a bit sloppy and didn't show an importance to his message."
1,Detestable,"All this movie did was really clarify that there was no objective inquiry done, simply propaganda. Save your money."
1,No. Just no.,"This movie is what you would get if you took Michael Moore and brainwashed him with fundamentalist Christian propaganda. It's not convincing to anyone but the people who already believe evolution is a sham (and if they need a movie to validate their beliefs, their beliefs probably weren't that strong in the first place), and it just alienates everyone else by blindly attacking evolution instead of using reason and logic to debate it. I feel sorry for the pro-evolution people who were interviewed because their words were twisted to serve a different purpose. I would not recommend this movie to anyone at all. Seriously. This movie is not worth the packaging it comes in."
1,Garbage...,"If you would like to lower your I.Q. by 100 points then this movie is for you. Absolutely the worst movie of all time. Creationist in, I.D. out."
1,Should be expelled from your living room,"Summary: Ben Stein doesn't understand how evolution works, so it must not be true. Also evolution is the root of anti-Semitism and Nazism! And anything we don't understand completely yet, it must be God! God is in the gaps!This movie is only for people who don't know anything about evolution, know it's wrong because they think their holy book say so, and know that nothing could ever change their minds."
1,A bad film and big lie.,"This movie wants to be a Micheal Moore film. A witty expose about an actual issue. But instead its a propoganda piece, and what's more, one that is physicaly painful to watch. If you have ever had issue with Michael Moore stretching the facts then understand, he has nothing on the bald misreprestentations, half truths, logical fallacies, and out right fabrications that make up this movie. And what's more the lies aren't even told in an entertaining way.But you don't need to believe me. Check out Rotten Tomatoes where currently expelled has a score of 8%. Basicly, anyone who is giving this thing a positive amazon review is a liar trying to pump sales."
1,Horrible waste of Time,"I should have known better when the Expelled theater consisted only of me, my girlfriend, and my friend on a busy Saturday night. Well, in all fairness there was another couple who walked out in the first 20 minutes, no doubt to get their money back and salvage the rest of their evening. Let me be brief because I already see many others have made very succinct arguments why you shouldn't part with your money to buy this tripe. First of all, you WILL be amazed at how bad the arguments are against evolution and how they use a red herring approach to claim all of society's ills on this theory. Second, you will find yourself bored as it drags on with each odd tanget it decides to pursue (maybe you should also order a book with this purchase to keep you entertained while watching the dvd). Third, you will want your money back. We got ours back after complaining at the theater. The manager just laughed and said how he had to do this more times than most for this particular movie."
4,"Finally, a decent documentary","1. For full disclosure, I'm already predisposed toward's the Ben Stein / DVD's underlying argument. With that said, this is a well made movie and it's not boring (as documentaries are concerned).2. My main criticism is that the movie would have been 5 stars if you had two of the experts debating the issues, point by point OR if at least Ben Stein more strongly questioned the evolutionists.3. Bottomline: a very solid documentary, that is both ""unboring"" and educational in regards to this very important topic."
1,waste of money,"dont waste your money on this DVD...nothing of value here, well it could have some comedic value, since there is total BS passed off as fact done with a straight face."
1,Total Sham,"The reason these ""scientists"" are not hired is because they are not scientists. They don't do experimental research that is peer-reviewed, revised, published and then challenged by attempts at replication. They only critique work that has been thoroughly researched and found to be the best explanation so far of observable phenomena. Thank God, they were not hired. If they had been hired, the university that hired them would be criminally liable."
5,I highly recomend this movie!,"I enjoyed this movie very much! I thought it would be boring, but Ben Stein makes it very entertaining as well as insightful! I don't know how anyone could believe in evolution after watching this movie. I of course believe in adaptation, but I know without a shadow of a doubt this world didn't just happen from some big explosion. Even Darwin had doubts, that's why it's called ""Darwin's Theory of Evolution""."
1,Two Words,"One of the things they did not discuss and the one thing that could of brought some validity to this film""Testable Hypothesis""Intelligent design proponents love to throw around the word science yet avoid the scientific method. Remember gravity is only a theory."
5,Refreshing and insigtful from a man I respect.,Our education system would do well to allow for various viewpoints. It seems any topic is valid in the classroom except science that hints of a Creator.
1,A Bad Movie... is just a bad movie...,"It's easy to pick a side in the creationist/darwinist debate, but only a conspiracy theorist would have the stamina to follow this absurd documentary that attempts to manufacture a controversy where none exists. Saw it in a theater with a couple of other people. I was the only one who stayed for the conclusion. ( I was out of town and hand nothing else to do.)"
4,Well worth Watching,"Just the 3 minutes with Richard Dawkins at the end of the DVD is well worth the DVD price as it exposes how absurd his views really are. Malcolm Muggeridge once said that when you stop believing in God, you'd believe anything...including super-intellgent aliens seeding the first cell on earth."
3,"Well made, but factually troubled","I like Ben Stein.This is a very well-made video.However, there are huge factual problems throughout this video.The basic premise of this production is that, in the spirit of open-mindedness, freedom of speech, and true scientific inquiry, it should embrace...or at least tolerate...intelligent design.Strangely, it never cleanly defines ID, or separates it with any clarity from creation science. It *never* offers any reason to take it seriously as science. It, very importantly, never explains what separates science from other areas of human inquiry. It therefore dodges all of the important questions that it raises.There are websites like www.expelledexposed.com which anayze the production point-by-point."
3,True but boring!,"It was so long and so dull that it took me two sitting to watch it. Well it was a good sit anyhow, everyone needs to sit down once in a while and rest."
4,Surprisingly easy to watch,"I was expecting to cringe at some point during the documentary, but that didn't happen. Turns out, it has good production values and a decent organization of its material. Not bad at all. Still, all the negative media coverage (most reviews, etc.) makes one wonder if ID is a friend disguised as an enemy or an enemy disguised as a friend, to play on the slogans of Arthur Peacocke et al."
4,hilarious,"The best reason to watch this video is because it is really funny. It had my kids in stitches. Ben Stein is a master of the deadpan letting people talk.The middle part on the connection of Darwin and the Nazis is true, for what it is worth. It may not be relevant to pro-Darwin people today, but the fact is that there was a connection of American Eugenics and European Nazism with Darwinism.The interview with Dawkins talking about space aliens is worth the price of the movie by itself. And my kids got a blast of how Dawkins couldn't say the word ""religion"" without choking."
4,Inconvenient truth??,This is the first movie I have seen that got a standing ovation!!!What are the naturalistic evolutionists so afraid of?? Why can't you question naturalistic evolution??? Why MUST we accept this as true? Might there be another possibility??
1,Ben Stein..!,"This movie is a complete sham. I've lost all respect for Ben Stein for making a movie that the facts are so manipulated to match his point of view. Before taking this movie as factual, please do research on your own and study evolution (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) and compare it to what he presents, you'll see that he's upright lying on his interpretation of it.Here's a video with some exerts from Ben Stein's interviews about the movie, that breaks down on how his knowledge of evolution is completely void.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZVAAvB8l4o&NR;=1Another link regarding the movie http://www.expelledexposed.com/"
5,Glad I got it.,"I have given 5 stars due to the fact that the film was highly watchableand well organized. Personally I would have wished more of the scientific evidence against Darwinism, of which there are tomes, had been presented. But this film was, after all, made for the general public, most of whom are not patient with too much new scientific information. Really only YHWH knows for sure how much it will get through to people, and I pray it will be vast numbers. I'm proud of Ben Stein for making this documentaty."
3,Sabotaged!,"first copy I got had dirt burned inside the disc.2nd copy had dirt, but it was on the outside of the disc so I was able to wipe it off. this copy did not have 2 of the extras, eventhough the box said it has them. they are all like this. so, this is a manufacturer's defect. please fix this defect!great movie though!"
1,Almost as bad as Michael Moore's crap,"Through crude editing, distortion of facts, and leaving out important parts of the story, Ben Stein presents a nonsensical mash of science denialism and false moralism. If you're interested in this movie, I recommend you read one of the many debunking reviews or watch it with the debunk subtitles that were made (google it)."
5,HA HA HA,"I particularly loved the part where Dawkins admits we could have been created, but by aliens!!!! A MUST SEE!!!"
2,Commited Christian Says BUNK!,"Questioning the status-quo of any authority including the scientific community might be the only thing of value in this entire movie. I thought it would be a very good movie. I watched it and felt like wow they are doing that to Christians! Then I took the time researching and found the real culprit was Ben himself. Well I guess he did a great job of making a buck, but he absolutely failed us when it came to telling the truth.Ben did a great job of avoiding the facts at all costs and producing something that is very controversial. This was essentially a ploy to arouse the indignation of the conservatives. IF anyone does a search they will soon find out that it is Ben himself who practices the art of silencing and excluding the opposition. Do some research and you will be surprisingly sickened."
1,Garbage,The producers of this film should be ashamed. Ben Stein should be ashamed. This is mindless garbage.
5,Excellent!,"It's about time the Religion of ""Micro-Evolution"" is exposed for the sham it is. Mr. Stein has done an excellent job with this documentary."
5,Enlightening!,"Unless you actually see the movie, you'll not experience the various levels of depth Ben gets into. Wonderful piece for opening discussion and as many of these responses indicate, those who have not seen the movie still have the audacity to condemn it. That's the most important reason why this SHOULD be seen be everyone, school-aged children included!Kudos Ben!"
4,Ben Stein rocks,"Cheers for Ben Stein! He takes on the priesthood of neo-darwinism with unabashed and uncommon sense. Whether or not you agree with Ben, you owe it to yourself to consider the validity of the Intelligent Design argument for yourself instead of swallowing the neo-darwinist hidden agenda without an ounce of scrutiny or skepticism just so the cool kids won't make fun of you."
4,My opinion,"Why do we need to talk about origins of life in our biology class? What does it have to do with science after all? Science is about muscles, bones, cells, processes inside the cells, plants, photosynthesis, mountains, rivers, seas, ocean creatures, birth-giving, laws, gravity, inertia, and so many other usefull stuff to teach. Why to wander into the religious field of study?"
1,Not enough substance... not even close.,"The problem this movie attempts to address is the blacklisting of scientists that profess a belief or desire to progress I.D. Unfortunately, the movie completely sidesteps the merits of I.D, and what you're left with is rather silly. There is a good reason not to want a scientist on board that believes an ""intelligent designer"" created the universe: quite boringly, it is the same reason you don't want a scientist that believes in ""magic."" Can a scientist conduct science with such a belief? Are they inherently worse off and less productive than scientists with no preconceived faith-based notions? Well, that's what the ""documentary"" is supposed to be about, but it strays from that point entirely too far.Be prepared to find plenty of rather propagandistic silly dramatics such as scenes with Stalin, Hilter, skulls, the mentally infirmed, and other nonsense that has no bearing on the debate.Save yourself the time, read the wiki page on Richard Sternberg."
1,This movie is everything you need to know about Intelligent design.,"Neither intelligent nor well thought out, this movie sucked hard.I dl-ed it and just laughed.Read other reviews for better coverage, but wow, this movie sucked."
5,GREAT movie,This is a GREAT movie about fundamental unanswered questions such as the origin of life that are suppressed by our academic institutions as well as by the media. Thank GOD there are people like Ben Stein out there making such movies.
1,lol Ben Stein lol,"Propaganda film that consists of dumbasses saying ""herp derp"" over and over again, broken up only occasionally when they are humored by someone vastly more intelligent than themselves."
4,At least as good as Michael Moore's films!,"An interesting and funny film that asks a simple question: Why can't scientists ask a simple question without losing their jobs?Ben Stein & Co. travel around the country (and world) asking why it's so ""verboten"" (forbidden) to advance the theory (or even mention) that organic life might have been created deliberately rather than arising spontaneously from a mud puddle and a bolt of lightning (or whatever). They interview many notable figures on both sides of this question (most hilariously Richard Dawkins). And they come away with some very interesting observations.Most notable among their observations is that academic freedom is CLEARLY being stifled by people who have a lot to lose, credibility-wise and dollar-wise, if competing views of the world are allowed to gain any traction. Big Science is also Big Business, as Ben points out.I recommend this film to anyone who has a brain and is willing to use it."
1,I'm now ashamed to be an American,"I can't believe anybody actually believes this stuff. Not only full of lies and propaganda, but a poorly done movie too."
1,The title of the movie is absolutely descriptive,"Because if you bring your intelligence with you to see this movie, you will not be able to contain your tears about how some people will attempt to pass propaganda as science. This movie tries, but fails, to convince intelligent people that so-called ""intelligent design"" is a viable scientific alternative to the fact-based and deeply scrutinized theory of evolution. Without a doubt, this movie may convince uneducated vulnerables, but it would be laughable, if not for the inherent human tragedy and the obvious waste of brain power, to eveyone with at least a couple of neurons.No intelligence allowed is the absolutely best title this movie could have. If someone with intelligence saw this movie, he/she would be insulted. If I could give it less than one star, I would."
5,"excellent, fair, factual analysis","Excellent, fair, factual analysisMany reviews that shred this video actually are prime examples of what this video is trying to expose: the religious devotion many scientists show toward darwin's theory rivals any church they love to criticize."
1,A complete waste of plastic,"This sham movie is not worth the plastic it is printed on. Stein drags out one tired fallacy after another and quote-mines actual scientists in a pitiable attempt to make creationists martyrs of the scientific process. It's ridiculous and sad that a speechwriter for Nixon and quasi-actor is trying to tell scientists how to do research. It's a sham from beginning to end, as is Stein."
1,This movie could suck a golf ball through a garden hose,"Yeah, like the title says, I wouldn't bring any intelligence to the table when watching this movie. If you do, your brain may collapse into a micro black hole. This movie is terrible."
1,A joke of a movie,"When watching this movie, think of the old movie 'Airplane', not much of a difference, yet 'Airplane' knows it's a joke."
1,"Ben Stein, a victim of his own eagerness","Ben Stein has shown himself so eager to promote his religion, he even forgot to learn about the theory he attempts to attack. He has proved so in interviews, written articles and in theis movie. This guy seems to be the victim of his own eagerness. If this movie had been a good documentary the makers should have at least make an attempt to know what the are talking about.If you like being fooled or lied to, go and buy this DVD. If you don't, don't."
1,Even free it would be overpriced...,"There are only two problems with this piece of propaganda garbage.1) It's a bad movie.2) It's HORRIBLE science!But other than that, I loved reading the truth at expelledexposed"
3,Lovely Meld of Natural Sounds With Flute Music,"My original intent was to use it as soothing background music for meditation. However, it became so compelling that I found it intrusive. May be good for other's focused listening pleasure."
4,nice read,"Based on the title ""How DNA Solved the Mystery of the Murdered Son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette"" I thought the book would be more on finding the DNA and comparing it. However reading the introduction I realized that someone wouldn't need a whole book to just write on that subject. An article would do fine. And so at the very end of the book in the last chapter, the DNA information gets into detail. The rest of the book is historical information on Louis XVII and his sister and parents especially while they were imprisoned. I had no idea about the situation of Louis XVII's death and I was really horrified and shocked. Being a sensitive person I kinda wish I hadn't read it in that detail. However the writing style was excellent and the book was well researched."
5,Absolutely Gripping!,"I actually have one more chapter to go, but this book is truly extraordinary. Cadbury is one of those writers who doesn't waste a single word. In other words, every sentence, every bit of information she gives is necessary. She's a great writer who makes the story of the poor Capet family (Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their children -- including the unfortunate Louis-Charles) come to life. You really feel as though you were there! Unfortunately, what happens to Louis Charles while a young boy in prison is depressing and hard to read, but the entire book is so outstanding, you cannot put it down!"
1,not as advertised,Products came on time . What came is not what was in description. Received much smaller cover instead. Understand why price was so cheap now
3,Warn winch cover for 15 series,"I bought this cover to help protect my new winch from mud and water mostly. To my suprise it does not actually cover the entire winch, just the top and sides like a hat, which is disappointing. Based on the picture of it I expected it to wrap around with velcro closure or somethig for total protection. The cover seems well made though and is a good fit. Note: the wires for your winch must run downward or they prevent the cover from from fitting on all the way."
4,A beautiful look at another side of life.,"At times gentle and beautiful and other times shocking, this book of personal, spiritual, and ecological discovery is a real eye-opener. It presents what I believe is the best portrait of Gaia I've ever read. It brings up a lot of questions and a lot of answers, and will probably shake up your belief system a bit, no matter what that belief system is. If you like this one, try ""Conversations with God"" (book 1) and the Seth books of Jane Roberts."
2,WEAK,"I never saw Gordon's War when it came out, but remember the trailers in the movie theatres. Somehow I thought this would be a good movie to buy, and except for watching a young Paul Winfield and probably the first exposure of Grace Jones...THIS MOVIE SUCKS! It is obviously an money making effort by those who made countless other BLAXPLOITATION movies"
5,Elegant and Practical watch,"The large face allows for easy reading of the time at even a quick glance. I have washed dishes with it, worn it in the pool, and hot tub and had no issues at all with water. The pictures don't do the band justice. The middle line is shinier than that outers which are slightly matte-finished. You can wear this watch anywhere, business meeting, gardening, evening out, it looks great and works everywhere."
5,Very Nice Watch,The design of this watch is sleek and classy. This is a high quality product absolutely worth the money I paid. I love it!
1,Time After Time,"Since this is the last soundtrack done by Dr. Miklos Rosza before he died, why are there not any excepts before buying here?"
1,Do not buy this book if possible,As a 3rd year EE student I have seen a lot of textbooks. This one is one of the worst textbooks I have seen. The topics covered by this book are very important but are explained very poorly. The explanations are longwinded and the few examples are far from useful. I would avoid this book if possible.
1,Horrible book for introductory signals and systems,"I had the (bad) luck of having Dr. Roberts as my professor for Signals and Systems. Frankly, his book sucks more than his teaching style. He copied different topics and examples from different books and put it together in this book. I think a copyright specialist should take a look at this book to find out all the stuffs he copied. Not many useful examples, no detailed explanation of how to solve problems, this book is useless."
3,Detailed Map but Print Too Small,"The map was very detailed. However, the print is very small and hard to read. A little larger print would have served better. Will probably not use this map."
1,NOT FOR MIDDLE-AGED EYES,"I've used Streetwise maps in the past and ordered both ROME and VENICE for an upcoming trip. Upon examination, it became obvious that with the advent of older eyes, these maps were no longer of any use. The print is very small. (or so it seems of late!) Not a problem with the maps, they used to be just fine! lolHad to return the maps for a more ""readable"" version."
2,Just ok.,"Rome is a hard city to map. Lots of small streets hidden down even smaller streets (but some how the Italians still drive 70 down them), but sometimes those are the streets that you need to find. The free map I got at my hotel was MUCH better than this map and I ended up not using it."
1,gift map for wife,The map is very disappointing. It is so small that detail is difficult to follow. The connections between trains and undergrounds are not possible to follow and the locations of stations are very difficult to distinguish. I had purchased this map and its companion for Florence as guides for my wife. She will find no use for it. I would have liked to kow that the product was so difficult to use.
5,Must have!,"I have and have used the Street Wise maps for New York - Manhattan, Boston, London, and Paris and have found them to be invaluable. I wouldn't go without one!"
3,"Good, but needs better metro/bus map","I just got back from a two-week stay in Rome, and this map was definitely more helpful than the paper one that came with the guidebook I bought. I especially liked the enlarged portion that showed central Rome. The lamination is key. We didn't get caught in any rain, but even with dry weather, my other, paper map was worn to shreds. Also helpful, the fact that some major landmarks were illustrated onto the streets, which helps you to stay oriented. The little metro/tram map was completely useless."
5,Awesome Map! Very durable. Great value.,Great map of Rome. Very easy to read with map of metro and a detailed map of downtown. Extremely durable laminated finish. Folds up to fit in a back pants pocket or jacket pocket. Very easy to follow. Great value.
5,Great Laminated Map of Rome!,This laminated map of Rome was very helpful as we moved around Rome visiting all the major sites.
1,Best Rome map is free one from hotel,"I had a Streetwise Rome map when I was in Rome in March 2012, but the map I used every day was a free tourist map (a tear off sheet) that I got from my hotel. The free map had all of central Rome on one sheet and the streetnames were much bigger and easier to read. The free map shows a lot less area than the Streetwise map, but most tourists stick to the central attractions and the Vatican anyway."
3,Streetwise Rome,"Good intro to area before we got there, but we ended up mostly using a street map when we arrived, which had a better division of the city sectors without having to flip back and forth."
2,OK but not complete,The folding laminated feature is great. The fact that part of the map is on one side and part on the back is not great. It is not clear how it continues. The map also does not show the outskirts of Rome.
4,Good to carry with you,"Like the other maps in the streetwise line, this is a small laminated map. It will be very good to carry as a reference when in Rome. Because it is small it is not so good for planning your trip -- which, of course, it what I got it for."
1,Do NOT buy this map!,Do NOT buy this map! It is garbage. The free map from the hotel was much better plus the hotel staff pointed out highlights on the hotel map. The Streetwise map is narrow in height and covers Rome on both sides. So it is almost impossible to follow a route across the city since the opposite sides do not line up. We stayed near Termini train station on the west side and went to the Vatican on the east side. The map was almost useless for this route since the entire city is not covered on one side. Try figuring this out at night with only street lights to see the map.
1,would not recommend this map,"I have several other maps by this company that I really like. The size is convenient, the plastic coating keeps them from tearing on a windy or wet day. But I threw this Rome map away in frustration and just used the one free from the hotel desk instead! I found it difficult to use; I'd look up at a street sign and then struggle to find that street in the tiny print and abbreviations on the map, and the index grid system was little help."
3,Map best for Historic Rome,Has most of Historic Rome but not much of the out lying area. Have bought two to use on different trips.
5,Excellent map for Rome,"Both my friend and I own this map and we used it recently on a trip to Rome. While it doesn't contain a listing for every place you may want to see, it has all the major ones and it was accurate. Very helpful were the subway lines drawn through the map, making it easy to see how to get to a certain destination. Anyone 45+ years of age will probably need reading glasses to see the smaller roads, but that is to be expected. One day I got my map very wet and while it crinkled slightly in one corner, overall it was waterproof, compared to many paper maps I've ruined in the rain over the years. Indispensable - buy one if you plan on visiting Rome."
4,Full_Arsed,"I recently purchased the DVD Full Bottom: Not Another Half-Arsed DVD Set and I have to agree with the subtitle. Totally Full-Arsed. This writing and acting duo is best known in the US from the 1980s series the Young Ones. Full Bottom originally aired between 1991 and 1995 in the UK, when Adrian Edmonson and long-time partner-in-crime Rik Mayall delivered 3 seasons of mayhem for the BBC. Opening with a stripper music theme that sets up their pathetic non-existent love lives. They illustrate a perfectly dysfunctional union, the Odd Couple meets the Three Stooges. It shouldn't work but it does. Over the top physical stunts and an earnest commitment to character pull the audience in. It is easy to overlook how good the work on this series is while we are soaking in the clueless optimism wrapped up in an array of impossible Sad Sack scenarios. All in all, a fun wild ride."
3,Not as funny as 'The Young One's',"If you liked the English alternative comedy 'The Young One's' or 'The New Statesmen,' you'll probably enjoy this series, just not as much. Rik Mayall, who in real life is no doubt a wonderful person, has made a career playing REALLY annoying characters (Drop Dead Fred); in this series he takes that role to new lows.In short, don't watch this series with someone who does not appreciate the more sophisticated crass-and-vulgar style of humor."
3,This show is suitably named,"Bottom is not original or particularly clever. It is, however, quite funny, quite painful, and quite British. You have to like Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson to fully enjoy this show. Try not to watch more than 2 episodes at a time as the action is repetitive -- lots of comic violence and crotch-twisting. Mindless fun."
4,"Very underrated, unjustly trashed Britcom...absolutely hilarious...","As many here have already said, this is one of the more interesting and hilarious British comedies ever made. It is extremely anti-PC, sexist, sleazy, violent, yet, most importantly, it's hilarious. The British have that unique talent where they can do or say the most heinous things, and make it all sound so charming. Too many critics didn't like this, naturally comparing it to The Young Ones, and not seeing it as a series on its own. The violent (and I mean violent) slapstick is hilariously over the top, Rik and Adrian are great, and there is some depth to this series. It's not a deep experience or anything, but sometimes you feel a little sad for these two, especially Richie. Favorites are the Gas episode, and when Richie and Eddie ""become"" shopkeepers. Episode 4 on Disc Three is great too, but I can't bloody well remember what the name of it is. This stuff is fabulous. Watch it now...."
5,A great set,"For those of you familiar with the antics of Mayall and Edmonson's BOTTOM, there's no need to tell you how brilliantly funny this show is. And for those of you not familiar, prepare yourself.No point going over this episode by side-splitting episode. What I really enjoyed about this set were the ""gimmes"" the extras. It was nostalgic for me to watch ""Boom-Boom"" (Rik Mayall's pre-Young Ones show). But for my money, the bloopers/outtakes, which are usually lame from other series, are riotous here. This great set is well-worth your bottom dollar (bad pun intended)."
4,Information Highway,"This book gives loads of information to children as well as adult readers. You are intrigued with the story as you are learning about the environment on the Barrier Islands. There are pictures of animals, trees and more with names to identify them to curious readers. Highly informative and written by a very informed author!"
2,not my cup of tea,i love this author when she writes of her life in the missouri bootheel and beekeeping. this was far too scientific for my tastes.
3,The Abysmal Brute by Jack London,"This novella is rarely included in most collections of Jack London's ""complete"" works. After reading it I can see why. It seemed rushed as if written quickly for some fast cash. Definitely not among London's best. But for all that it's an entertaining, sometimes hilarious, expose of the rottenness of professional boxing with a romantic subplot thrown in for good measure. I am surprised that some talented screenwriter hasn't latched into this obscure novella as grist for a very good madcap romantic comedy. Picture this. An independent-minded socialite newspaperwoman who hates boxing is sent to interview the # 1 contender for the world championship. She falls in love with him when she finds out that, far from being the brute portrayed by the media, he's a sensitive art-loving, poetry- reading outdoors aficionado. Cary Grant and Kate Hepburn. Yup, it got potential."
2,Posing Bench,"My seat was not level at all, when you sit in it, you either for forward or backwards enough to almost lose your balance... I do not recommend this product... I'd recommend going w// the adjustable stool."
2,No laser,"Hi, be very careful when analyzing the description of the item. Do you see they say ""LED laser pen convenient for presentations and a flashlight function""?they confuse an LED with a LASER.This pen has no laser pointer, only LED flashlight.check out (...)"
2,where's the laser?,"I just got this pen. The package says ""4 Functions in One"" on the front, but nowhere does it mention the laser. It only mentions the stylus, black pen, and flashlight. I'm sending it back."
5,wagon train,another great video of wagon train. I have been trying to collect different shows on wagon train. I heard that some will not be released till march. Thanks
3,Both DVDs contain the same 3 episodes,Both DVDs contain the same 3 episodes. so its an obvious mistake that Amazon should rectify.It seems that there are only 3 episodes available. So Sad.
1,"very sloppy disc here,mine was just bad","i took a chance on this because i love wagon train and hoped for a better transfer than the ones i had.well that didn't work out to good because the transfers were the worst i have seen. sound drop-outs,blurry,and the sound the rest of the time seemed to be off some from the speech. i may have been just me but do be careful"
4,Wall street journal 101,"This book distilled a lot of knowledge about how to apply different financial vehicles to your own finances. This book is like condensing basic wall street journal personal finance information into a book.(Which it is )so you do not have to try to wade through it for months or years trying to figure out basics when you are getting started in the world of investments.This book touches on stocks,bonds,futures,options,dividends, money supply flow chart, historical stock market performance, and much more. Highly recommended for beginners, the more experienced might find it to basic in things they already know,great education for the rest of us."
3,One good chapter,"For me, this book has one good chapter, its about debt; otherwise this is just an average book. I've read six money managment books this summer. I liked this one the least. I just bought four more copies of Jane Bryant Quinn's SMART AND SIMPLE FINANCIAL STRATEGIES FOR BUSY PEOPLE to give to my young adult children, its the best of the six books I read."
5,Excellent General Guide,"This book is an excellent source of information about everything related to managing your personal finance. Without getting in too many details, the author covers whatever is required to know in order to build a foundation about personal finance: debit, credit, investing, planning, insurance and taxes.Recommended to people who never thought about their financial future."
3,Elementary,"This book is fairly entertaining to read, but too simple. The title should be changed to ""Introduction to Personal Finance"" This book would be helpful for a person puzzled by the choice between UTMA versus 529 college savings accounts and annuity versus term life insurance. It does not advise on how to evaluate stock and mutual fund investments."
2,Same old Same old,"This is a good book if you're in high school, but for those of us who have graduated from college, we already know this stuff. I recommend Graham's book (also coveted by Warren Buffet) and The Model Rules of Personal Finance for Professionals (American Bar Association 2008) for understanding how to manage your financial life and how to invest."
2,Very basic,This book is not for anyone with even a basic understanding of personal finance. There were some decent ideas (a handful or so) but laborious in reading so much basic information to get to them. Very surprised for a book with the WSJ name on it.
4,great book for the absolutely clueless (like me),"This is a very informative book written in easy to understand terminology. This should be REQUIRED reading in every high school in the U.S. I wish I had this information when I started working. It would have been helpful before I bought my house, and is still very useful as I plan my retirement savings."
3,Good book,"Contains a good amount of information for a beginner and has plenty of intermediate and advanced stuff mentioned throughout. Don't pay attention in great detail to any of the examples they provide, particularly where numbers are mentioned. As this book was published in 2005, much has changed, but general concepts are likely to never change. Treat it like Cliff notes - good info, but not real meaty since each section is 20-40 pages or so. I would have given it 4 stars if it was revised with newer examples, closer to 2012. I would buy a revised version. Can't go wrong for the price and as I've always said, if you find one useful piece of information for $12, that can save you hundreds or thousands over time... you can't go wrong."
1,aweful,This unit never worked from day one and I should have sent it back. At the time I thought that it was the fact that my computer was old and the hard dive was failing and that was why it didn't work. Now I realize that it was just that this product stinks
2,"J.A. Henckels TWIN 6"" barber shears",I was somewhat disappointed when I received these shears. The main problem I have with them is that they are are not pointy- but have rather blunt tips. This is not good for detailing tiny areas.
4,I READ IT STRAIGHT THROUGH!!!!,"After reading the first book in the series After Midnight, I was anxious to read Portia and Julians story and I was not dissapointed! their story was fasted paced funny and sometimes sad. Portia's love for Julian oozed of the pages, it was unconditional and unwavering. The only thing I wanted was more intimate romance between the couple a little bit more weaved through out the book would have made it a 5 star review for me, instead I gave it 4 stars for that reason. The book has excellent chraracter developemnt and excellent writing and very easy to read and fallow. If you like this genre I would suggest KERRELYN SPARKS Vampire Series their is no other author out their that can compare to her style of FUNNY, SAD DANGEROUS, SENSUAL AND ROMANTIC, HER STYLE IS FUNNY!!!"
3,Good Enough,"Teresa Medeiros is a wonderful writer, so even at her ""not so great"" she writes a good story. This tale wasn't as entertaining as After Midnight, but it was nice to see the characters of her first book play a role in this sequel. Julian's character was still rakish and desirable, and Portia was still sweet and driven. The love affair was semi-believable, but it lacked a depth that Ms. Medeiros often puts into her romances. The Vampire Who Loved Me is a light and easy read and enjoyable enough to pass a few hours with."
3,A Light Read,"This book is a quick, easy read. It just lacked the punch/inspiration to grab readers emotional attachment to the characters or the story. In other words, I finished the book but just wasn't that interested by the end of it."
5,The Vampire Who Loved Me,"If you like a twist of the dark side with your romance, then this is your story. I fell in love with Adrian and Julian. Once I picked up the series, I could not put the books down. I did not want it to end. Great read."
3,Not Worth 373 Pages,"This book seems to go on forever!! It pretty much stays ""blah"" the entire time with no ""OMG I've got to see what happens"" moment. I'm glad I borrowed this book from a friend and didn't purchase it as it would have been a waste of money.If you come across this book...keep walking and find something much more interesting and worthy of your time."
3,Flat,"Teresa Medeiros is one of my favorite authors but I just couldn't get into this story. I found the charecters flat and while I usually love to read about previous main charecters in series stories, I couldn't care about either the main charecters or their siblings who had been showcased in a previous book."
4,Sink Your Teeth Into...,"Quite a good paranormal romance by Teresa Medeiros! The story picks up with Portia Cabot joining her brother-in-law in his vampire hunting in England in the early 1800s. Portia lost her heart (and more) to her brother-in-law's brother, Julian, five years earlier when she helped him in a duel of vampires. Now Julian has resurfaced, and Portia is eager to help him once more.Medeiros has set this story in a very believable era, and while many of her characters show traits of modern behavior, she has created a vampiric world that seems at least plausible. The romance is hot and heavy, and the action is tense, especially towards the end. Not ever meant to be heavy-handed, Medeiros accomplishes her romantic intent with humor and emotion, if at times she is just a bit over-the-top. Anyone looking for fast, fun paranormal romance would do well to pick this one up. Medeiros has written a winner overall."
5,love it love it love it,Absolutely worth the wait. It wasn't an easy book to read with the constant reference of the hero's philandering ways--especially with that other vampire--but there was an acceptable reason for it. I love the fact we were able to see what happened to the characters from After Midnight. A Must Read!
3,"Color is hideous, be careful.","I like this shirt for the fabric, which is soft and easy to iron, and the french barrel cuffs (it comes with cuff clips or you can use any pair of standard cufflinks). However, the color (blue with lime stripes) is *loud* to say the least. I figure I will wear a sweater over it just so the cuffs and collar will show."
5,Women's shoes,"These shoes are great, even better than I expected. I have been looking for this very style for almost 5 years and was lucky I found these! From the first time I put them on, they felt like slippers on my feet (so very comfortable). I was very pleased with the quality! I liked them so much, my husband ordered me another pair in red for my Birthday. The color is just beautiful! They are truly a great value!"
3,Witty and entertaining; somewhat disappointing.,"Overall, the book was enjoyable and well written. The characters are interesting and there is a witty charm that is sustained throughout the novel. However, it is deliberately predictable which takes away from a level of drama that could have made this a great novel."
2,Too snide for me,"I got this book after having it highly recommended by a friend. I admit to being disappointed. Though well written, it's just too snide and tongue-in-cheek for me. Perhaps I take my fantasy too seriously? Unlike The Princess Bride, this book came across as being actively hostile to fantasy conventions."
3,Tongue-in-cheek but sadly lacking in character,"A different take on the standard fantasy story. Wry and amusing, making it a pleasant read. Characters are one-dimensional and plot is entirely predictable. The many unresolved issues cry out for a sequel, which I will avoid"
4,The only Barnes i like,"As a casual fan of sci-fi and fantasy, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was the first book I read by Barnes, and the only one of his I liked. It is a witty and humorous tale of the life of the main character, from toddlerhood to kingship. Mostly lighthearted, with moments of darkness, it is a tale in some ways reminiscent of the Brothers Grimm. Yet, the tale itself is a sometimes subtle, sometimes obvious jab at old folk tales, as well as stories with morals (though it has morals of its own).Barnes has managed to effectively combine elements of the classical romantic (falling in love, ancient science, magic, and exploration) with post-modern storytelling and a solid splash of wittiness and puns.It's a shame that this charming, intelligent and mostly honourable book is his only crowning achievement."
5,Best album ever,"Invincible is the greatest music ever made by Michael. If you loved Thriller and not have listened to this album, you really MUST. You will not be disappointed. It truly is magical. Buy it!!"
4,Great comeback...,"I love Michael but I don't think this album is as good as his others. It needs more dance type songs. Don't get me wrong. This album is good enough to stand alone. In fact, I am writing this review to highlight some of the best songs which are unfortunately underestimated.-Break of Dawn: This song is beautiful. This song really exhibits his smooth, relaxing voice.-Heaven Can Wait: Ditto.-You Rock My World: This song is one of the best ever, even in comparison to his other work. It always lifts my mood and makes me want to dance.-Speechless: This song is gorgeous. It is the perfect song to send to someone you love. You have to hear it! It is amazing.-2000 Watts: This is a cool song with a funky beat. I cannot explain it except to say that it is hip.Listen to these songs."
4,Good album,"I remember beggin my dad for this album when it first came out (I was 17 at the time) and he caved in and bought it for me :)I loved it right away... I like how Michael mixed some funk into the songs. I'd like to know how he came/comes up with these beats lol, better than most of the crap thats out there now in the pop world.'Break of Dawn', 'Heaven Can Wait', 'Speechless', and 'Butterflies... just WOWOnly one I didn't care for was 2000 Watts... just, eh *shrugs*'Threatened' was awesome, but sometimes I had a hard time hearing the lyrics/voiceover over the beat.Overall, a great album... sad that its his last studio album though :((Unless the family releases some of his unreleased songs)RIP MJ"
5,"You don't like it? Listen again, it'll change your mind.","I'm not even a pop fan, and I gotta tell you, I brought this album just for ""rock my world"". But yo!! Michael Jackson put together a banging album and I'm glad I got it. Don't believe all the hype? Listen to it again, I'm telling you, tracks 4,5,6,7 all in a row are something else!! MJ can still hit a note, and the energy in the club jawns is still of the hook. I think every song is banging, and I AM NOT a pop fan!! Cop the album!!"
5,Invincible ushers in the new age of the King,"This album has delivered the promise of Michael Jackson. The sound on it is remarkable and he has invented a new version of pop and R and B. People like to talk about the rumours and state of his face, but it has been clear throughout history that the best way to judge Michael Jackson is to look at his album, and this album is superb. The thumping resilience of ""Unbreakable"" is a land mark in modern music, and the ballads banish the cringworthy ""You are not Alone"" and instead bring back memories of ""Human Nature"" and ""Liberian Girl"". Michael Jackson has the most impressive body of work in music and this album will prove to those who doubt him that he is still the best there is. Non-jackson fans will love this album and will then seathe through his back catalogue and want ""Off the Wall"", ""Thriller"", ""Bad"", ""Dangerous"" and ""HIStory"". Buy this album now. Its time for Michael Jackson to return to the throne."
3,Ehhh,"If it wasnt Michael, I'd never take interest. This album is mostly junk, with maybe a track or two to save it.Love MJ, but not Invincible."
3,an honest review,"This CD Has many different styles and a retro feel, Here is the playlist , with my favorites with an asterikUnbreakable- good driving beat, positive message, sounds like a mix you'd hear in a german club *Heartbreaker- Nice song , Billie Jean Pt 2 "" Don't go around breakin' young girls hearts"". Invincible-see Unbreakable *Break of Dawn- early 80's soft rock sound , shades of Air Supply2000 Watts- modern hip hop Heaven Can Wait- Sexy song hot sweaty blues sound Cry- church spiritual song *You Rock My World - part Thriller and Neuvo-Jazz. *Butterflies- early Chicago soul scene. Speechless- love songYou are my Life- hated it Privacy- angry loud rehash of Scream Don't Walk Away- a filler track The Lost Children- The ""We Are The World anthem for the 2000's,o.k. if you like that sort of songWhatever Happens- Blue Oyster Cult Don't Fear the Reaper"" quality , mysterious and thought provoking, not for everyone. See you online and at the used record store- SNL"
3,"Some people is unjust with ""Invincible""","I don't know why I only hear bad critic about the last Jackson's album. I bought it a few days ago and even though I can't say that it's his best one, I think that ""Invincible"" is the album that continues with the same style that made famous to Jackson. Buy it or not is your decision and your personal point of view of Michael's career."
3,certainly not fresh,"I was hoping MJ would reinvent himself this time out. He clearly has stuck with the tried and true. Hence we have songs very reminiscent of 'Dangerous.' This is not entirely a bad thing. The cd has some funky grooves, infectious beats, musical hooks and those ever popular and listenable vocal overdubs. It simply doesn't rise any higher than that. Given the lapse of time since his last release, I was hoping for innovation...not there. After several listens, I don't expect this will be a cd I return to over time."
4,The Last Album for Michael Jackson to be collected,"I am fans from Hong Kong. Honestly, the ""Invincible"" Album was not hit here in Hong Kong; also no introduction by D.J. I just knew the songs of this album thru internet. Actually, some of songs are still great, such as:Speechless (I love this song the most, because the lyrics are very touching)You Rock My WorldPrivacyThe Lost ChildrenYou Are My LifeUnbreakableCryAs Michael's fans, I would collect this also, as this was the last album (issued in 2001) that Michael issued in his life; then after all other albums issued were just collections of his old songs. I recommend to buy his CD, as because I love his booklet inside CD, which is priceless and very valuable that you can never find on Download.I used to listen his songs everyday so far, and sometimes cry or very sad. The world is getting emptier without Michael.I miss him very much. He is always KING OF POP."
3,"Not a ""Thriller"" but certainly not ""Bad""!","A lot of negative things have been said about this latest offering from Jackson and most of the people saying it would have said the same thing if he'd released the greatest album ever. If you listen to this as piece of music and not just as something that Jacko has done then it does come across as a quality work which features something for everyone from catchy choruses to power-ballads. Highlights for me are ""Rock my world"",""Cry"" and ""Heartbreaker"". The guy can do better but very few others could be this good!"
4,"The magic is still there, however...","Michael Jackson's first solo album in 6 years is not a ""masterpiece"", regardless of what his record companykeep on implying. However, this doesn't mean that it's nota good album. On the contrary. Invincible is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the best R&B album released lately; the hot-shot producers who took part in the album, combined with Jackson's (who still didn't lose his magic) talent created good songs, which, perhaps, aren't as strong as some of his earlier work, but are still worthy of listening.If you are looking for a good R&B record - purchase this one. Try to forget the fact that this is a Michael Jackson album and enjoy the music without comparing it to his earlier works."
2,"""TheThrill IS Gone""","I bought this CD for My Sister for Christmas.She LOVED IT.I can't stand IT.There's no question in my mind that Michael Jackson is one of the the Greatest Artist in my life time,but there isn't a hint of that magic on ""Invincible.""I can't think of 1 Track that I LIKE.Its the same Digital Booms played on every track.Anyone of us who has alittle musical talent could have come up with this record.Bring back ""Q"" Michael on the next one."
2,"Way past what I wanted or expect from him...dance, my man.","OK, concept albums have to be done by all artists and this is the one for MJ...but to expect that his fans would accept this for pop, singing or dancing was a step."
5,Great condition,"At the time of purchase, this product was hard to find. For that alone, I'm pleased with this CD. It is in good working condition."
3,I can't see where Michael's going with this,"Sure some of the songs are singable and foot-tapping. But I don't hear anything ground-breaking; where did the originator go?As much as I enjoyed everything Michael Jackson's done up to this point, if he makes another album like this I think he'd better think long and hard about his future. I'll always be rooting for this lovable guy, but I spare nobody when they make mediocre music."
5,Invincible,"I found this to show how he ( Michael ) has grown as a person, an artist and as a man who knows what he wants in life. The lyrics to Butterflies, and Speechless is a great example of emotions. This album is a must have!!"
4,Michael's back!,"I never really doubted Michael's ability as an artist to come out with a solid album.Thank God I wasn't dissapointed.What I was worried about was if the world was ready for ""invincible"" because this album is really different from the recycled sounds that we've all been accustomed to listening to lately.This album is refreshingly different and original.It has the ""off the wall"" funk and ""thriller"" originality.The dance tracks are the ones I love most(check out 2000 watts)Michael Jackson has once again created someting innovative and pacesetting.The question now is will the world be ready for it?"
4,Wow - this is actually pretty good...,"I got this album real cheap...and boy, was I impressed. Yes some songs are overproduced, but songs like 'Break of Dawn' and 'Butterflies' show Michael is still at his best.If you can get this CD at a great price at this point, do it - you will be surprised."
5,TRULY INVINCIBLE!!!!,"I just listened to 200O watts and was shocked that this sound was Michael Jackson. Talk about HOT!!!! Great voice and tune!! This album did not get the attention it truly deserved. Especially ""200O watts"" with his deep voice. There should of been an uproar over that one!!! What else do you have for us MJ!!! :)A great loss for this planet and for those who never saw who he truly was... a decent and kind human being!!! I will miss him very much!!!"
5,NO ONE CAN BEAT JACKO,"I HAVE LOST THE COUNT OF HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE LISTENED TO ""ROCK MY WORLD"" THIS SINGLE IS NOT ONLY SOUNDS CLASSIC BUT ALSO POSSESS A NATURAL AURA IN IT.THE VIDEO IS SUPER COOL THE WAY MICHAEL SING AND DANCE IN THIS SONG IS COMPLETELY UNIQUE AND THATS WHY THIS SONG NOT MAKE U FEEL BORED EVEN IF YOU ARE LISTENING TO IT FOR THE HUNDREDS OF TIMEI WOULD ALSO LIKE TO WRITE THAT MICHEAL IS BLESSED WITH UNNATURAL TALENT, ITS RARE AND WE SHOULD RESPECT IT AND STOP TALKING ABOUT HIS PRIVATE AFFAIRS. HE HAS DONE REMARKABLE WORK IN ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND IAM SURE HE WILL KEEP DOING THAT IN FUTURETHATS WHY MICHEAL WAS KING OF POP,HE IS KING OF POP(I GIVE A DAMM TO THOSE WHO DENIES THAT) AND HE WILL BE KING OF POP FOREVER AND EVERLOVE U MICHEALHOPE U WILL COME OUT WITH A BANG ONE MORE TIME AS U USULLY DO"
1,Invincible is INTOLERABLE !,"This is same rhetoric jackson did his entire career. It's uninspired, as are all of his albums, and a complete "" cookie cutter "" album. The only reason the album sold as many as it has is due to his name. It has nothing to doing with musical genius or ability. The only thing great mj ever did was die, and I'm glad he can't torture the world with his terrible "" music "" anymore than he already has."
2,The Dust Bunny is Back & Can Go Back To Where He Hides,"Wow the King of Pop is Back!! Give me a break, despite a few good balads on this disc, the rest remains the same electronic ditty's that he always put out. I have to admit that I did like a couple of his albums way back, but for this one there is no like, theres nothing. Seven years fans waited for another studio album and then it was announced ""Invincible"", Not quite. The man is so talented in what he does, yet he gives us Billie Jean all over throughout the album. And what about that Track Invicible. Didnt the beatles do something that weird called Revolution #9? I cant say much except that its in my library and will gather much dust. Not for me Michael, and if you have any sense it would gather dust on your shelf too, one listen and thats it, farewell, so long, adieu, goodbye. Thats it.Leonard K Collins"
3,Not on of MJ's Best,"I purchased this to complete my MJ collection since he passed. It's not one of his best. Butterflies, Heaven Can Wait and Rock My World are the best songs on the cd"
1,...,"... There's a reason why this album is no longer on the billboard charts and is one of Michael Jackson's lowest selling albums. I was skeptical about buying this CD because so many critics had given negative reviews. ... The songs are very tired and drab. If this CD is coming from the ""King of Pop"", why do the beats sound like something my grandmother might like? And I've never heard a Michael Jackson CD with so many filler songs in my life! It's hard to tell which songs were supposed to be the main attractions because their all so bad. My opinions of this CD have nothing to do with MJ's personal life, but he seems to have lost his creative spark. When I first heard this CD, I thought it was a complete waste. However, I have since found that it makes an excellent coaster...."
1,"""INVINCIBLE"" ?????","Not After This Piece Of Garbage. This Entire CD Is Monontanous And Boring. Michael Should Have Rested On His Laurels From His Past Efforts, Because The So-Called ""King Of Pop"" Has Recorded A CD That Will Surely Be A FLOP."
1,"GIVE IT UP , MICHAEL !!!!!!!!!","This must be one of the most boring albums I have ever heard!!!. All those studio gimmicks sound ridiculous. Grow up Michael -start recording real music for real music fans not some techno crap that tries to appeal to 12 year old kids.Try growing musically, or just GIVE IT UP!."
1,"Creepy album, sounds like an old witch","Nobody wants to hear or see Micheal Jackson in 2002. He was great in the 80's but it is over! , he's creepy,fat and what's with the ""Laurie Petrie"" hair-do ?"
1,"Time to retire, Michael","Michael Jackson's best days and albums were two decades ago. He has steadily declined ever since and has become an aging and even more ego driven (I think the title says it all) and self-absorbed artist who has now reached this point. This disc is lousy. The songs are weak and the music sounds computerized...Tired, programmed retreads and boring grooves which offer nothing fresh musically by a person who now seems to be desperately hanging onto past glories and his self-proclaimed ""King of Pop"" tag. MJ fanatics will give 5 stars to a disc of him singing in the shower, but if you are simply looking for an objective take on an album from an objective listener, then take it from me....save your money. Sony and Mattola are not the reasons this disc bombed."
4,MJ IS BACK!!!,"The reviews by critics have not been favorable for this album but as I listen to each track I am trying to figure out what the heck the critics were listening to. This album jams. Anybody who knows Michael from the Quincy Jones days will appreciate Michael's legacy as both a balladeer as well as an up-tempo dazzler. The music of this album seems to be the greatest accomplishment. Between R.Kelley and Rodney Jerkins the bass heavy up tempo groves are more than incredible. I can honestly say that at least half the songs are great and the others are very good. Michael cannot repeat Thriller but then again, no one can. INVINCIBLE is a great buy and well worth it."
4,MICHAEL.. is Epic,"I must first say that I have only reviewed a few songs.. I have not heard every last single. But no need for that. Michael Jackson is EPIC. The fact that he can manage to have at least 2 or three TRUE cuts on each of his CD's is far more than impressive. His personal life and style(to those with comments about his video for Rock My World)aside, this man is TRULY talented. He has a beautiful voice and a true staying power in spite of controversy and criticism. My all time fav on the CD is Butterfly. I have never heard a falsetto flow so sweetly! If you are a die hard Michael fan, it doesn't really matter what he makes, you know he is great. But for those who are not, like myself, give this CD a try. I guarantee you will be surprised at how many times you press the ""repeat"" button on some of these cuts."
2,major disappointment,"Okay, I know it's going to be really easy to bag this album but, really, it took six years to come up with this??? Is this the best he could do? I wasn't waiting for a massive change of direction or anything really radical, but a few decent songs and some spunky arrangements would have been nice. As it is, Invincible is all terribly predictable - Heal the World style ballads, children's choirs, hiccup vocals, big name guests, etc, etc. but there is no spark nor is there one decent song here."
2,Underwhelming.,"The whole world was waiting for the comeback of the self-proclaimed 'King of Pop' in late 2001...""You Rock My World"", the debut single, was a promising slice of pop-r&b with a beat, that MJ is famous for creating. The rest of the album failed to fulfil that promise. Tracks such as ""Heaven Can Wait"" and ""You Are My Life"" drone on like the usual MJ 'ballad'. ""The Lost Children"" is an appalling attempt to recreate the awful ""Heal The World"". Songs such as ""Privacy"" and ""2000 Watts"" are unoriginal, basic rehashes of the heavy stuff on ""HIStory"". Apart from the glorious melancholic vibe of ""Butterflies"" and Carlos Santana's guitar on ""Whatever Happens"", Michael fails to show any of the class that once made him the world's biggest selling superstar..."
4,Invincible? Not Really. But Still Better Than Anyone Else,"Once you pop in the invincible cd you hate to take it out. Listening to other albums becomes a sin almost. It is that good. Notice i say good, not ""invincible"". A couple of the songs, namely Break of Dawn and 2000 Watts, just don't fit with the album. However the other 14 tracks more thatn make up for it. The first three tracks just scream to be released to the radio. I don't think that Mike has had a better opening since ""Off the wall"". Throw that in with the mindblowing ""Heaven Can Wait"" and you wonder why Mike just doesnt release the whole album. Maybe the doesnt quite live up to mikes standards, but this is the best r&b album to be released in the last 5 yrs."
4,He is back,"Look at his music, and not the words that people use to describe him. He is truly an artist who is, not matter how you slice it, can sing. He makes the words dances along with the music. For me, this record misses in one aspect. Michael, we needed more than four ballads. Those pretty songs deserved a star a piece."
5,Adding to Dan Perlberger's opinion,"Dan's review was very detailed and I found it useful. I got my copy last week and had been listening to the songs everyday. I have to disagree with Dan's rating on Cry and The Lost Children. I think they are the best songs on the album (Please listen to the lyrics). The Lost Children always brings tears to my eyes everytime I hear it. It is just so beautifully written and sung by Michael. To me, these two songs are the essence of who Michael Jackson really was, as an artist and humanitarian."
4,"Great CD, Great Amazon","The CD arrived sooner than promised, in good conditions. The CD is great! Amazon is great!"
3,"Mike IS strange, but he's still got it.","Say what you want critics, but, invincible is promising. Sure, we all realize that Mike is eccentric at best, but this album has some of the BEST mid-tempo R&B EVER. ""Break of Dawn"", ""Heaven Can Wait"" , and ""Butterflies"" are songs with wonderful lyrics, complex harmonies, and excellence musical arrangements. ""Whatever Happens"" with Carlos Santana explores the complex situations of man and woman and does so BEAUTIFULLY.Chris Tucker is hilarious in the prelude to ""You Rock My World"". One must play Invincible on a SURROUND SOUND system to truly appreciate the music on this album. Is this Mike's best work? NO. Is it his worst? NOT EVEN! Critics I have 2 words for you: SHUT UP!"
1,Indigestible,"A lack of promotion on the part of SONY did not harm the sales of this product....a lack of quality material on the part of JACKSON hurt the sales! People talk about musical projects when they're of good value and are properly produced. The ""average jo"" requests songs at radio stations when they're something worthy of hearing. Eventually that CD begins to sell as the songs become more familiar. However, with this release, there's nothing good, worthy to request nor does it contain anything inventive to talk about! This clunker is truly Michael's musical turkey! Instead of the title ""INVINCIBLE"", Sony should have considered labelling this CD ""Really... BAD""!It does not even merit one star !"
1,A Michael Jackson Album Not Worth Rating,"OOOH!Mid-tempo,smarmy contemporary R&B balladry and highly mawkish sentiments-this is clearly Michael Jackson at thevery bottom of his bag of tricks.The hit ""You Rock my World"" isbeyond pathetic and the albums closest thing to a decent song""Butterflies"" still sounds like a song Babyface threw into thetrash ten years ago.Warning to Jackson fans-AVOID THIS LIKE THEPLAUGE!!"
2,Poor Sales.,"This album didn't do as well as Michael Jackson had hoped it would do. I think he thought it would be the next Thriller or Bad. This album features the top ten hit ""You Rock My World"" and ""Butterflies"" a top 40 hit which I never heard on the radio. This album has no good songs to it and I can't even get through the whole CD. This album didn't do well only selling 2 million copies compared to 26 million of Thriller. This album is not a buy because it is mostly just filler."
1,half star,"JERKO JACKSON , take the tape off your nose and put it over your twisted blo hole , quit writing songs about your mutant kids , learn somenew dance moves freak"
1,INVISIBLE (:<),"Yo,,,what's happenin' 2 Mike's face?...It's fallin' appart so badly on this cdcover that U could see right through him.Poor Mike (:<)Oh yeah....this cd smells like stanky feet."
3,EXCUSE ME???,"I really do not know what he was thinking with this album. I did not hear any pop sounds .Nothing groundbreaking? Where did all the alleged money go to? Where is Michael? I read one of the reviewers who said ""if he makes another album like this I think he'd better think long and hard about his future"". I think i totally agree. However, i liked Heartbreaker and Whatever happens.Goodluck to Mr. Jackson in the future."
3,Michael is losing his luster...,"I hate to say it since I'm one of his biggest fans, but this album just falls flat. Instead of cramming in such a long list of songs, he'd be better off going for quality. There is just too much fluff and garbage between the good songs that it makes listening to the entire album difficult. Not to mention that many of the songs sound alike, so you begin to lose track of which is which.I suspect Michael is trying to please everyone and in doing so will please few."
1,already forgotten...,Whether these songs were inspired from water balloon fights with french kids or a humongous delusional Ego run amuck. Invincible is out of touch with reality Who can relate to any of these songs? The producers should quit the business and Michael Jackson needs to stop writing music. The songs don't even sound good. This Childish Clutter-Bang artificial Pop should be forgotten.
5,invincible is beyond good!,"seriously, you need to give this album a chance. some of the ballads on this cd are some of the best of his career. and his vocal range is very impressive (i also want to be a singer and know how hard it is to hit the high notes)now if you love good singing, check out these songs: butterflies, speechless, don't walk away, you are my life.now just to groove to: break of dawn, heaven can wait, cry, whatever happens.good dance songs: heartbreaker (i think this is the very best song on here, no doubt, a club banger), 2000 watts, you rock my world.basically, you're getting another great michael jackson album, i hope every fan will give this a chance. for the trying times in his life when this album was made, i think he produced an overall great album. i'm listening to speechless right now as i'm typing this and i think it's one of his very best."
5,Invincible is Amazing,I love the CD. All of the songs written and sung were magnificent. The music and the words of the song had a lot of meaning and the sound was great. Micheal was a genuis. I don't see why the reviews in the past that I heard about the cd not being good is completely wrong. Actually the only time that I heard about invincible was when Micheal was dead. I wish he was here to make more music. He gets all five stars from me.
5,The King is Back!,"I really can't quite understand any bad review on this CD other than the fact that was stated in the cut ""Privacy, you want to bury me""! This is the best CD I've purchased in years! I got it a month ago, and just can't take it off my CD player! It's Michael Jackson at his ultimate best! I love 14 of 16 songs on this album! A lot of great music for your money! My suggestion to anyone who is or was a M.J. fan, give this one a chance! I promise you will not be sorry! It should be nominated for a Grammy because it's truly a great piece of work!"
4,I LIKED THIS ALBUM A LOT!!!!!,This album was not the greatest but I still liked it and I really liked the songs You Rock My World and Butterflies. I did not really care for All The Lost Children or 2000 Watts.
5,Michael jackson is the best hs'e INVINCIBLE,"Well for me this album is as good as michael's other albums,I think thhe album is in michael's standards.it has some michael's finest songs to date,I think SHOUT and What ever happens are great.Speechless is as beautiful as She's out my life.i recommend to buy the album and listen to it.donot listen to critics."
5,INVINCIBLE: Cool final curtain call!!,"This album appeared to be one of the greatest MJ albums that I've ever heard. Michael Jackson is phenomenal! Waiting for this package in the mail, I wanted to listen to it so bad! (You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it - great song.) Anyway, my favorite song on here is ""2000 Watts"" - ELECTRIFYING! It is a cool dance party song that makes you want to put on your sparkle glove and dance like MJ. This is a cool album.- I wrote the above review for my 11-year-old son :)"
5,Magical...,"Michael Jackson is magical. Magical because he's one of the few artists who, despite whatever controversies he's dealing with, can make you forget them simply by listening to his music. And his last album, Invincible, does just that. From the bumpin, ""Rock My World,"" to the soulful, ""Butterflies,"" which, thanks to radio, is slowly becoming a certified classic, to the touching, ""Heaven Can Wait,"" and on and on and on. There's not enough you can say about this album. It's entertaining to say the least. Can't wait for the next album, Mike!"
3,"Great Artist, Mediocre Album...","I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan, so I'm probably unfairly using his previous albums to measure the worth of this one. There are a few very catchy songs, including ""Unbreakable,"" ""Invincible,"" and ""You Rock My World,"" but several of the songs are too predictable and similar. This is a decent album, and certainly excellent among today's new pop releases, but if someone wanted me to suggest a first MJ album for him or her, I'd definitely have to go with ""Thriller"" or ""Dangerous."""
4,a new sound,"I have never heard music like this before..it's a new sound!!Brilliant. R n' b at a slightly faster pace. It works a treat.This is an excellent album! Funk ,soul ,hip-hop,ballads, everything rolled in to one. Unreal! Lots of variety that many other albums don't have."
3,Not quite invincible...,"I've heard a lot of the album and there are a few great songs in there. I wish Michael was the only singer on the album, that's the only thing wierd. Unbreakable is awesome! Maybe get more upbeat songs on there too. A lot of slow songs. Good overall!"
5,Invincible Spirit,"Michael Jackson's latest album was an excellent addition to his already existing repetoir of smash hits. The music was really creative, he has completely reinvented himself. There is still some traces of old-school Michael Jackson, but this album gives its listeners the more accomplished and seasoned Michael. My favorites are; Heartbreaker, You Rock My World, and Heaven Can Wait. Those songs are a good representation of how experienced Michael really is in the music world.Second of all but not least, who can really contend with Michael in tems of creativeness, accomplishments and hardcore talent? If you buy this album and really take a listen to it I think you'll agree that Michael is and will forever be the TRUE KING OF POP!"
1,A poor recording,"I'm a fan of MJJ Music.Unfortunately this disc is not the best of it, except two or three songs.But my rating is 1, because the CD brought 2 or 3 tracks recorded wrong, with a hissing sound.I really hurt a lot, and no opportunity to change it, because I do not live in the U.S."
2,Way too long and clunky,"I am not the biggest fan on the planet but I own all the solo stuff and love Thriller and especially Bad. Dangerous began the slide as far as I am concerned. Some good songs, but a few were a bit plodding and overlong. Invincible just really takes everyting that was awful on Dangerous and throws away all the good. Some of the tracks are listenable, but most are too long, plod along, go round in circles in oddly timed stoccato beats that seem to be very clinical and cold. It's all fake hand claps, sequenced drum loops and beatboxing type noises. Where are the guitars? Where are all the layered vocals? Where is the piano? Where are the melodies and for God's sake - drop the guest rappers. Awful! This is all programmed blips and bangs and it sounds fragmented and jarring.It's not truly as horrible as some are suggesting but it is a hard listen."
2,No fast music :((,"Looking at the title of the album, I thought it would be another great dance track album with fast catchy music like ""Blood on the dance floor"". However I was dissapointed, really dissapointed with the slow numbers on the album. I would rate this at 2."
2,Not so good,I found this new CD to be a bit disappointing. Michael Jackson went from being angry and screaming in his music to sounding like he is on tranquilizors. This CD is very melow and very R&Bish. There are no pop songs to get you dancing. I was hoping to hear some new dance tunes from him but this time. If your into light R&B then you'll like this CD. If you like Pop/Dance music your out of luck here.
2,"ItsNotMattola'sFault,ButTheManInTheMirror","Michael Jackson is blaming everyone for the poor sales of his lastest CD,""Invincible.""Now he's playing the race card and bringing in the Rev,Al Sharpton.The one to blame MICHAEL is THE MAN IN THE MIRROR.The record is the worst I've ever heard from this GREAT Artist.Jackson has insulated himself from the Real World for years,and thinks he can Jump Back to his Thriller Days,and go on from there.I think this is the BEST Thing that could happen to Michael.Its time to Make That Change."
4,Top album,"Well he is back, finally, and I have to say that this is his best work since 'Dangerous' from 10 years ago. He has clearly returned to the smooth sounding beat and soul that defined his earlier work, and the continued presence of Teddy Riley in production especially just adds to the overall feel. He has mixed up the tracks with a good selection of the feel good numbers and hard hitting dance, as well as some personal opinion/feeling expressed in others, which seems to creep into all of his work of the last decade or so.If you have been a fan for life with Michael, then you will love this album, and despite all the negative media attention he gets, he still belts out some serious tunes. Absolutely a legend in our time."
3,If it wasn't for Butterflies,"For the R&B crowd this album will be very disappointing. The first 3 cuts are garbage and the beats are repulsive. 4-8 are the highlights of the album, with the sun shining on number 7 ""Butterflies"". Butterflies is definitely what I expected to hear when purchased the cd. The rest of the cd is save the world type vomit. In closing, wait for the greatest hits next Tuesday."
3,Colour Me Michael (4 shades of Michael),"To say this is Michael Jackson's ""best album ever"" is a joke. You can't expect him to repeat his prior successes, there will never be another ""Off The Wall"", ""Thriller"", ""Bad"" or ""Dangerous"". It's mediocre rehash from here on out. There are a few tracks on ""Invincible"" that make it worth lisening to, ""You Rock My World"", ""Break of Dawn"", ""Heaven Can Wait"", and ""Speachless"" are some of the ones I enjoy. The rest of the album sounds like A: the rantings and ravings of a lunatic and B: limp wristed flowery ballads, that I can really do with out. But hey that's Michael Jackson so what can u do?"
3,only 4 things i have to say.....,"""Break of dawn"", ""Heaven can wait"", ""Butterflies"", and ""You rock my world"". No more....No less! Enuff said."
3,What's with all the hataz??,"My boy Jacko can still bust out the straight beats after all these years. Okay, granted, this doesn't capture the 1983 magic of ""Trilla"", but ""INVINCABLE"" is still a phat album. The aging Michael continues to rail against the secret forces that are against him every day. Wouldn't you be paranoid if everyone was harassin' you??This stuff is whack. Just give Jacko a chance, and please oh please quit your hatin'.I'm out....."
5,Michael Jackson back and better than ever!,"Michael Jackson is back and he is back with a vengeance. Unlike his last CD (Blood on the Dance Floor) Invincible brings back the Michael Jackson we all know and love with a beautiful variety of ballads that will send shivers down your spine. `You Rock my World"" is the main song many people think of due to the music video but it's not the only great song on this CD. There are 16 tracks and out of them all, the only one I didn't really enjoy was 2000 Watts.Some of my favorites are Heaven can Wait and Cry. I really hope they decide to make music videos out of these two songs in particular.Weather you're an old-school Michael Jackson fan or if your just hearing him for the first time there is absolutely no doubt that Michael Jackson is, and forever will be, the undisputed King of Pop."
1,Not Convincingly Invincible,"Love Michael Jackson, hate this album. Not only Michael's worst album, but one of the most terrible albums ever recorded by anybody. Ever."
1,Michael Jackson is a one hit wonder,"You will not see ""INVINCIBLE"" featured on vh1's Ultimate Albums. This is [$$$] bargain bin material. The days of hit songs from loony-bird Michael Jackson are over. His next album should be called 'Granny Beats from Kiddie Land"""
1,Don't waste your money,"I have this album, and there are 16 song on it. There are about 2 or 3 that are actually good. This may explain why only 2 of the songs were actually made into music videos. This album is only good if you are a HUGE Michael Jackson fan, but otherwise, don't waste your money. It's not going to make you feel the way Dangerous or Bad or even Thriller do after you listen to it. Like I said before, this album is really just for the HUGE fans. Casual fans like myself will NOT like this album. I recommend buying just the handful that are good. To me that was Cry, Privacy, and even Speechless. I didn't care for the others, and unless you really love EVERY song the guy sang, you probably won't either."
5,MJ's still the best,"Nice. I think this CD was definitely underpromoted. It is really good. You need to listen to #15 ""Whatever happens"". I play this song over and over. ""Speechless"" is another lovely song. Michael still has a great voice."
3,A decent album; please stop whining,"Any time an album is this uneven, it frustrates reviewers and buyers. This record is a mix of many different musical styles. Many of the tracks are heavily produced with a thick noisy texture, and this makes the disk have a stylish feel, but can be irritating.... But overall it has some great music, and it may not be a tremendous record like Dangerous was, it is still better than 99% of the [stuff]out there."
5,it gives me butterflies......,"I love this album so much! I remember the day it was released last year, I left school early just to buy it and listen to it. At first I couldn't believe there were so many ballads, but I really love the album! Michael combined melody and grittiness perfectly, he and Rodney work really well together! My favourites are Unbreakable, Heartbreaker, Break of Dawn, You Rock My World, Butterflies, 2000 Watts, Cry, Whatever Happens and Threatened. Of course I love the rest of the songs as well but these to me stand out the most!recommended for: r&b; and hip hop fans, pop fans, adult contemporary fans, in fact this is an album for anyone and everyone to enjoy! Buy it today!"
4,Michael still has it and don't you forget it!,"I cant believe why this album did not do as well as it should have. BUTTERFLIES, BREAK OF DAWN,HEAVEN CAN WAIT,and YOU ROCK MY WORLD. Those tracks alone are worth the purchase of the album. These are great songs. I am curious to know what was people expecting from the gloved one. I still support Mike."
4,This is a good album!,"We tend to have our eyes caught on his eccentric behavior or stories around his unreasonable death. But we should never forget that he was a great singer and dancer and composer. As everybody feels, because of unprecedented sales of ""Thriller"", his subsequent albums was unable to get as much attention as it was supposed to. Please listen to the songs in this album. They are well composed, arranged and sang by Michael Jackson. It really brings his soul and attitude to entertain people. I really feel sorry for his death and sad when I think we will never be able to hear his new songs any more."
4,It is actually goood,"At first i thought this album woudln't be all that good sncehe only had one video of the album, i loved you rock my world and butterflies but didn't bother to listen to this album. but when he passed away one of my co-workers was playing a song on her phone. i knew it was michael but i never heard the song before. It was called Break of Dawn and I fell in love with the song. so being that everyone went mad and bought all of Michael's albums i decided to give invincible another shot and the album is not bad at all, I also love Unbreakable with Biggy Smalls thatz a hot joint. There are probably over songs that have never been released by michael that i hope come out. He will be missed"
4,This is great work,"I think the reason why this album flawed was because people didnt realise ''wait a second...were not in the 80' anymore!''.When people think michael jackson, they think weirdo or thriller. Why dont people appreciate his new work? It's not bad, in fact in great, but just because its nothing like ''Thriller'' or ''Bad'' people just say its bad. I dont get it really.''INVINCIBLE''. most people think he is talking about himself. In fact he isn't, he is talking about a woman. there you go.The best tracks on this album are:You Rock My WorldUnbreakableHeartbrakerSpeechlessCry2000 WattsPrivacyMost songs on this album are excellent. okay, the worst song has got to be ''heaven Can Wait'' that song is abysmal.But people dont appreciate MJ anymore, which is sad. All the false accusations have ruined his career. his life.He will hopefully make a comeback soon.Just listen to this album before making judgements!"
4,Underrated,"All I can say is that I listened to the critics initially and wrote off the album but I should have known better. When I was checking out some songs that he did after his passing, I found ""You Rock My World"", ""Butterflies"", ""Cry"" and I found them very good. I am sorry it took for his passing to get me to hear them, but it only confirms that the brother was a genius and I'm only sorry he is gone. The album is good and although I know we all can put out something that sucks, I feel it has its merits if by these songs alone."
4,Very good,"One of the greatest things about Michael Jackson is his versatility. Also I think his fame is a symptom of the strangeness that surrounds him. He's not going to be a ""normal"" person by the standards by which we measure others. And I think the fault of most people is that they try to look at him as being someone who should be logically accessible as well in our concepts of our own worlds. I really liked this cd and recommend this highly for the beats."
4,A fan,"No this album is no Thriller, Bad, Off The Wall, or Dangerous. But it what it is: a pretty good pop album. Micheal cannot top himself, anyone expecting that has unrealistic expectations.I am no pop fan...but Break of dawn, Butterflies and Heaven Can Wait are more than enjoyable to listen too. It's kind of like Michael Jordan's comeback...neither will ever be the same because of age,changes in the game and the glutton of young stars, but its still kinda cool to seem them both try. Even when MJ is half trying he's still better than a lot of stuff out there. He may out of touch with the rest of the world..but he can still make some SOLID music."
5,Sweet!!!,"You love his voice; you love his lyrics; you love his magic -- you'll love ""Invincible.""I listen to this CD at least once a day. It makes my subway ride to/from Wall Street a sweet ride. There's a track for whatever mood I'm in or that I WANT to be in.Be good to yourself - get this now!"
2,Definite change,There is a definite change in the demeanor of the songs and music. He seems to go more for the fabricated instruments than the lyrics. Not his best work.
5,Michael is Back,"His first full length studio album in a decade, Michael does it very nicely. With his HIStory album, a collection of greatest hits with a few new songs; his preceding album, Blood on the Dance Floor, a remix album with a few new songs; and simply being Michael Jackson has kept him at least in the back of our minds. If you have yet to acquired a collection of songs by none other than the King of Pop himself, Michael Jackson, now is the time to start. Invincible, may seem a bit rash for the title of an album, but Michael holds true to his claim.This is your typical Michael Jackson album complete with your uptempo dance songs, ones you can still attempt to 'moonwalk' to, all the way to your harmonious ballads. This has it all, with a beats that keep it a par above your everyday sound. Rodney 'Darkchild' Jerkins compliments Michael's sound excellently.If you don't already have it, try it out. You will definitely enjoy it."
5,AMAZING MR. M-I-C-H-A-E-L JACKSON,"The decade of 2000-2009 was a challenge. I recently discovered ""INVINCIBLE"" and I'm overjoyed and sooooooo blessed with this collection of Michael Jackson's always ""evolving"" talent. INVINCIBLE is WONDERFUL. I have adored him since 1968 and I own vinyl albums, 8 track tapes, cassettes , DVD's, and C.D.'s. Noone will ""EVER"" adapt to the changing media as he has. We are FORTUNATE to live in the same ""time and space"" with a GENIUS and EXTRAORDINARY talent like MICHAEL. If you have not bought this C.D.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~do so IMMEDIATELY~~~~~and ""fall in LOVE"" with his voice/essence/nature.~~ asante Mr. JACKSON~~"
5,This CD will keep you begging for more!,"This album is so great you won't be able to turn your CD player off! This is a killer comeback for the King of Pop, and this proves that the King still reigns forevermore! The album begins with some upbeat songs that will just make you want to get up and dance. Then it slows down a bit with ""Butterflies"" and ""Speechless."" These songs give you that really weird feeling in your stomach. You feel like you are there with Michael! ""Privacy"" is a great song that shouts out the pain Michael has felt throug fame and fortune. I hope you buy this CD! Take it from me, you will get more than what you paid for!"
5,"""Invincible"" is great!","I just listened to ""Invincible"" in my car, the entire CD, and I rate the music, lyrics, chorus, instrumentals, and, of course, Michael Jackson, as great music. It is really too bad that more people didn't buy this album when it was first released. I believe negative journalism ruined MJ. It is really tragic, I think, that so many people, from different walks of life, wanted to cash in on him through lies. Pertaining to ""Invincible"" it will remain in my car and I will continue to enjoy a great artist through songs that are new to me. Beautiful voice, beautiful person, tragic death, RIP, MJ."
3,"good, not great","in his first proper album since the ego-fest that was HIStory, MJ returns. The question is can the man who calls himself the king of pop, soul and rock (although everyone knows that was really elvis) reclaim his throne?this album suggests not. don't get me wrong, its a very good album, but cannot compare to thriller or even off the wall. many of the tracks sound several years out-of-date, and sadly this is not enough to put mj back at the top and make the media forget all about skin bleaching, surgery, paedophilia accusations, his publicity stunt marriages and his bizarre lifestyle. this marks the sad demise of one of the most talented (though not THE most talented) entertainers of the last 50 years."
3,Threatened,"This definently no thriller, No bad, no dangerous.We shouldnt even compare the four together. I am a huge Jackson fan but I have to tell the truth. In this album I could only find five songs I liked. all I could say to the others are help! But at least he tried, his voice hasn't changed much its gotten a little lower but its still the same MJ. I love him but I dont think this should be added to any MJ collection."
4,not his best but a lot better than HIStory,"[T]his is a very accomplished and polished album with some of the best songs michael has ever done on it. if you trimmed the fat off this album - speechless, the lost children, the ennio morricone influence at the beginning of that track with santana on it and that awful mutual appreciation rubbish at the end of that song, then i think we'd be left with a classic mj album, though he does need to stop getting awful rappers in on the faster songs. don't walk away is a classic as is you rock my world and butterflies. threatened is truly awful i'm afraid. it would have been a good song if it wasn't for the thriller rip-off dialogue on it. so there we have it- play with the tracklisting a little, dump the soings you dislike and enjoy. anyway i'd rather have too many songs on an album than too few. it would still never be as good as bad though."
3,Not too sure about it.,"This album is interesting. I can't say I hate it, but I certainly don't love it. He sings like he used to. It's a much rougher sound, and I think that's the appealing part about this album. But there aren't any actual instruments. Everything is synthesized and looped into a more urban-club sound, and that makes it feel colder and less inviting than the classic MJ sound.My first listen through the tracks left me disappointed, and though they have grown on me -- some -- I am still missing the great bass fills and the natural, soulful sound of his older releases."
5,Love Him or Hate Him He's back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have waited for years for this album, I think he hasn't lost a beat. I am a old school guy and grew up with his music, and I personally think he still has the ability too make music that makes your mind, body, and soul grove! He has been through alot in the last decade, but he has put that all behind him and is back to where he belongs, on the top of the charts. Don't hate! APPRECIATE!!"
4,take it somewhere else,"I came here to read people thoughts on this ALBUM only to find crap like KILL MICHAEL JACKSON. Dont you have better things to do than spew hate at someone you dont know?! I suggest focusing your energy on yourself. Get a life.This album was great and I agree some songs arent the best but I enjoy it, especially Butterflies. If you like Michael's MUSIC, you should buy this."
4,Second best to Thriller,"This is an astounding album from the returning King of Pop, however it does have some shortcomings, especially the Lost Children song, but otherwise it is a great album!! It is too bad it did not get the promotion it deserves, the 30 million dollar price tag is a bit steep for the quality, but of course Michael was expecting Sony to at least try to sell the album, which they did not...."
5,This cd rocks my world,This cd is awesome. For all Micheal Jackson fans the wait was good because he did such a good album. I am not a big Micheal Jackson fan but this album make me his fan.1. Unbreakable great song the beats are great2. Heartbreaker I though this is the wrong name for the song but it is good3. Invincible you enjoy the song4. Break Of Dawn great5. Heaven Can Wait it is ok6. Rock My World the best song it ois great7. Butterflies cool song8. 2000 Watts greatr lyrics9. Shout greta name it make the ppl shout10. Don't Walk Away great song11. Privacy that a song for his self12. Cry great song13. The Lost Children I dont know14. Speechless great song15. Threatened cool songgreat cdluv lupic
4,Very Good..but nothing spectacular.,"I really enjoyed this album. I liked almost every song..except You Rock My World. I really do not like that song..so I was surprised to like the album as much as I did. Filled with the Jackson trademark beats, rythyms, falsetto, and a lot of OOH'S.Funky tracks like Unbreakable and Heartbtreaker dominate most of the album as well as alot of sappy, syrupy ballads like The Lost Children and Cry. Basically the trademark Jackson ballds sounding just like You Are Not Alone and Heal The World. I was expecting some groundbreaking material and I did not get any. The songs sound a bit dated.Alot sound the same and I can't remember how some of them go, they seem to all run into one another, but overall a good album worth having. You're sure to find a few tracks to get you moving like Jacko."
4,It was better then i thought!,"Ok! Now, i def. remember when this album came out. It led into the 2-3 year investigation and all that stuff. Anyway, I remember intially being turned off by this album, because it seemed like he was trying way to hard with everything. I mean the lead single's video was long and lathargic. Also, he seemed alittle eccentric on tv. So I decided to skip out on this album. Anyway, after reading a few reviews I decided to give this album a chance! Boy was I wrong for ever skipping out on this cd. It's got a great r&b vibe to it. It's very remiscent of what his sister Janet did that year. Great, Uptempo music. I thought most of the tracks were really strong, and you rock my world is classic mj, just trying to have an updated sound. He's very talented at picking good pop music choices. And almost 9 years later, this cd still sounds very fresh! I would def. buy this cd if your into pop music!"
3,Michael returns with good songs and too many writers!!!!!,"This is NOT Michael's best album. That was argueably ""THRILLER"" which was innovative in the music of the 80's.Invincible has some good songs and the best are:Unbreakable,Break Of Dawn,Heaven Can Wait,Butterflies,Y R M W,Privacy,Whatever Happens and Threatend.However songs like 2000 watts,Invincible,LOST CHILDREN,and Heartbreaker are simply mediocore.The album has times when it flows,and times when it doesn't. If you pick your favorite songs and skip the others you'll love his album. Of course devout MJ fans will love the entire set."
5,Listen to the Music not the critics,"I consider my self a huge MJ fan, and an honest one as well.His previous work,HIStory even though it had alot of catchy beats, it was very disappointing in the sense that MJ was really angry when he made it, and it showed in the album. It made me miss his oldder stuff.'Invincible' really delivers and makes up for HIStory big time.Only 3 out of 16 songs deal with the subject of the media harassing him..I think he has a right to address this issue, the rest are a combination of really upbeat and wonderful songs including some amazing ballads, I think he did more than needed of the ballads but they're quite good and enjoyable.One thing for sure, MJ is back to his old style and it's paid off."
1,"The Worst, believe it.","This is the worst mess you'll ever hear, Michael Jacksons weak voice is drowned out by digital booms and voice alterations not COOL from cheesy rap cameos to creepy kiddies, this sounds like demented elevator music , Butterflies, 2000 watts, The Lost Children??? hated it,.. how corny and weird can you get? is it over for the ol' king. Get some writers under 55 next time. Every track just gets WORSE and WORSE. pitiful"
3,Invincible isn't no Thriller,"Michael's last great album was BAD and after that DANGEROUS was good and HIStory was aight. INVINCIBLE.... i dunno what to say. I mean its far from a ""BAD"" album but I thought it would be better. Its a shame such a great guy had to get picked apart by a bunch of media hype. If your a true MJ fan, you'll go pick this one up. But all in all i think MJ put it best when he said ""you ain't seen nothin yet""!"
2,Are you serious?,"Since I am only 16 I missed the Michael Jackson craze when it was original in the late 1980s. Now that I am older I enjoy going back and listening to Michael's corny pop beats. The songs are fun to sing along to and can make anyone happy. Invincible on the other hand is awful! With only two OK songs it puts shame to his name as well as Rodney Jerkinds. It is worth downloading it for free. I feel sorry for the king of pop because his reign is over, and i would rather invest my money in Nsync or Britney for good POP!"
4,Decent come back by the king,"Not a bad album at all, atleast in comparison to what's out lately. Could have been better if the slow songs were more about romantic love and happy relationships rather than loneliness and victimization. Otherwise this is dope especially that rock my world joint with Chris Tucker. Yo Michael, next time around hit us with more uptempo songs.Peace."
4,"Great, under one condition","Let me start of by saying i have been a Jackson fan for as long as I remember. I am only 17, but i hit a time in my life around 10 where it was all i listened to. I saved every penny to buy all of his albums. Even though he has gone through all the media frenzy, i have remained a Jackson fan, listening to his music regularly. The release of Invincible made me get up and go to my record store and pick up a copy. I usually dont buy cd's, but i just had to get this one. Anyways, there is one thing i found i didn't like about it. I am a big fan of the upbeat Jackson songs like remember the time, black or white, thriller, beat, the way you make me feel, etc. and alot of the songs on the cd or more slow tempo, like liberian girl, and others of that nature. That made me a little dissapointed, but nonetheless this is still a great album and EVERYONE should pick it up. Don't let his past fool you, Michael Jackson, was, and still is, the greatest performer of all time."
1,not a good purchase,"first off, micheal's new material is not up to par with the epic works of his past. there are some shining moments on this mostly ballad laiden album. Hearbreaker is among the best of michaels work...or at least what we can expect from him in this stage of his career...."
1,ya'll only bouht this cause mike died,I did'nt like this album when it was released and i'm not gonna gonna pretend i love it now cause mj passed.
1,find more jammin tunes in your granny's attic,"This sounds like bad Carly Simon B-Sides? Where's the funky pop? Michael Jackson get in shape, lose the page-boy WIG, stop writing and singing about CHILDREN, donate money to a Childrens hospital, if you must.. Give us some good music, I had to force myself to listen to this(his) whiney drivel to give a review of it, The first 3 tracks sounded like N'sync , UGH The rest sounded like AM Radio from the 70's Zzzzzzzzz He tries to put Rock in a few songs but it doesn't work, sounds stupid. It truly deserves it's FLOP status! Brandy's Full Moon is So much better!!!"
1,Invincible? No - Pretentious? Yes!,"Unfortunately, it seems that Michael Jackson's personal suffering and would-be martyrdom is playing itself out in his public life and in his music. Unfortunately, neither is even remotely interesting. I wish him all the best but I think musically he's done and generally has nothing more to say. I hope he finds peace so that he no longer feels the need so subject the world to his artistic mediocrity."
4,Better than most other cd's,"OKAY.... so its not Thriller, SO WHAT? Those are classics you're talking about... Nothing will ever be as good as that. It's still a great album. It really growns on you.. Songs like Whatever Happens, Heaven Can Wait, Cry, Butterflies, Don't Walk Away, and Speechless, which is a nice ballad -- they are all nice. ITS WORTH IT! I have a foriegn copy, so instead of You are My Life, I have Dance and Shout! heh.. thats a good song"
5,What a journey!,"This album is an awesome progression of music as Michael journeys and grows. This album has so much heart and energy, it will blow you away! The way Michael writes makes him a true genius, it gives anyone the ability to parallel to his songs for they are not specifically written but soft edged so they have universal meaning.This album will bring out the heart in you and as it did to me, make you wanna dance and release the love."
5,Love this CD,"I would say this CD is definitely his most personal. I love all of the songs on here; he really expressed his inner emotions with this CD. How this was his poorest selling album I have no idea. Songs like Speechless, Butterflies, Don't Walk Away, Break of Dawn, Heaven Can Wait, and The Lost Children really grab at your emotions. He was an amazing atrist. Only great singers can put that much emotion into a song. RIP Michael :["
5,Seriously Underrated...,"What amazes me is even after he died I found out a number of people still didn't even know this album existed or just never heard it.This album is perhaps a bit long. But, that is truthfully the only real flaw. There isn't much that needs to be said. Just get it if you're an MJ fan. You will not be disappointed."
4,Great middle ages series,I'm enjoying this whole series. It's best to read in chronological order since the characters develop as you go along. Great historical details as a result of good research.
5,Crowner John,"This series is a really good series and Crowner's Quest is an excellent example. The place and setting takes you back to the time when Richard the Lionheart was King of England and John, his brother, was trying to cause great trouble. The character of Crowner John is a very interesting and likeable one. If you are already a Bernard Knight fan, you will love this book and if it is the first of the series you have read you will immediately want to read all of the others. I can hardly wait to read the next one!"
5,Money well spent!,"Hey everybodyWell I ordered the Ahriman Gate from my Barnes and Nobles (sorry Amazon!) and I'm not disappointed. It was very engaging and in fact I think I'll ready it again. I would buy part-two if the author wrote it, which it felt like it was set up for. In fact it kept me up late as I could not put it down. Its like the old time cliffhangers where every chapter ends with something that makes you have to read the next chapter. Very good."
2,Fictional hogwash,"If you enjoy fictional intrigue, then you may enjoy this book. There were some far fetched ideas and it lacked in reality. Some of what the authors brought you through; I can not imagine a real person even attempting; let alone surviving the fantasy ordeals. I for one would not waste time or money to buy this book, unfortunately I did both waste the time and the money on this book. It was not at all what I was expecting and if you really want to read fiction about angels and demons; I recommend Frank Peretti's Piercing the Darkness and This Present Darkness."
5,"""Fiction"" (if you took the blue pill.)","WOW!! I just got The Ahriman Gate Friday and I finished it Saturday! What a page turner! Wonderfully well written, easy to read while being conceptually deep and thought provoking. Painted very detailed pictures in my mind's eye with the descriptive style of their writing.Kudos to Tom and Nita Horn for combining so many popular theories and ideas into one cohesive and intelligent (if not plausible) story. Everything just fit together so naturally. Definitely a book for anyone interested in truly understanding the ramifications of another Genesis 6 scenario.""Just because something hasn't happened yet, doesn't make it a work of fiction."""
1,Cash-less and Troubled,"Cash-less and troubled - that's me after trawling though close to 400 pages of twaddle. Really just a cut-and-paste of various facts and theories, lumped amongst some very poor fiction. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes, and the central character (""Joe"") just seems to want to kill anyone in order to get his own way - is this Christian; or how about trust in Jesus? I would think that Christian fiction, whatever that may be, should at least lead the reader to a sense of deeper faith or wanting to know more. This book does neither. Beware ... deception at work. This book is will only leave you with the empty feeling of having wasted your hard-earned money and more importantly, time. It troubles me that some very smart people have put their name to this. In Christ."
2,UFO theory,"I liked the way this book got my interest very quickly, in a fast paced storyline that holds a lot of truth, with the story....but I found about half way into the book, it got much too graphic in the area of brutality and imagined images that some of the characters had,I understand that with this subject, its part of what its all about, but I dont personally think it added to the whole ""teaching"" of the theory, or to the storyline itself...I think we could have got the idea in our own heads, without the specifics being written about...sorry but it left me feeling let down,and at times quite sick,I actually had to make myself finish this book, which was quite disappointing...:-(and for me, it took away from the all important message of the book that we all need to hear and know about...."
5,Death Be Not Proud,I remember watching this movie in my 8th grade English class. It was inconceivable to me as a 13 year old that kids died. At that age you think only old people die. I don't think there was a dry eye in that class room. We read the book first then watched the movie. The movie and book is about John Gunther's son Johnny who struggles with a brain tumor and eventually dies and how he had a positive and cheerful attitude throughout his illness. This is a great movie for kids to see. It was sad but put life in perspective for us. I hope it comes out on DVD so my kids can watch it.
2,Not as good as I remembered,I saw this movie when I was a kid and remembered my dad being moved by it. Things are a lot different when you're older. I wouldn't recommend this. It was a bit boring
3,Fenian's Fire meets Tom Clancy,"I had no idea that Queen Victoria had been the subject of a serious assassination plot. Sure she had had potshots taken at her but this was SERIOUS. The Fenians (Irish) were out to get her - or were they? In a style reminiscent of Tom Clancy, Christy Campbell reveals the characters and plot. A criticism of the book is that the story is not linear and jumps around. The historical characters are also brought in at different times to suit the author and do not come into the story in a logical fashion. Or not to me anyway."
2,"For the scholar, not the layman","Although subtitled ""The British Government Plot to Assassinate Queen Victoria"", this book is really about the fight for Irish home rule from 1858 to 1891. If that's a subject that's of interest to you and you like your history full of facts, dates, names and places, this book may be for you, but I found the going tough and eventually was skimming more than reading. It's a scholarly piece of work, but I prefer my history a lot less dry and more digested."
2,doors again,"I love the Doors but I don't need 3 sets of their work re-arranged. I thought this was live or something in it was new but it's just another collection of their studio work. If you have all their albums, you already have this."
1,grabaciones no son originales,"este cd tiene grabaciones que no son originales, son versiones que fueron grabadas despues por cantantes diferentes a la grabacion original y que en su voz fueron verdaderos exitos"
5,"Hubbert's Peak, The Impending World Oil Shortage",I loved it. Very interesting and extremely informative.
2,A layperson's guide to petroleum geology,"Depite its title, this book is really about how to find an oil field. It was mostly a layperson's guide to petroleum geology. About a third the way thru' the book diverged from its premise - that we are running out of oil - and didn't return to it until the last few pages. The author is trying emulate the feat of his mentor - Hubbert - who in the 1950s managed to predict US oil production would peak in 1970 when others said it would last forever. The really interesting information, what we are all going to do after 2004 when the oil supply peaks - was missing. The projections of shortage were based on statistical extrapolation of existing oil fields. Of the emerging oil fields in Siberia, the author says ""there is no oil in Siberia - only gas"". This could be a weakness that might considerably affect the conclusion."
1,Enough junk pseudo-science,"This book is one more of the genre of typical junk-science, geo-phrenology, delivered in the usual pompous manner of American tenured professors of geo-geo nonsense, complete with the irrelevant dropping of terms used in the real, hard sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry), combined with casual disregard for both scientific data and economic facts, flavored heavily with outright falsehoods.Maurice and Smithson have already described Deffeyes best:""Every ten or fifteen years since the late 1800's, `experts' have predicted that oil reserves would last only ten more years. These experts have predicted nine out of the last zero oil-reserve exhaustions."" - C. Maurice and C. Smithson, Doomsday Mythology: 10,000 Years of Economic Crisis, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford, 1984.To paraphrase the late Justice of the United States Supreme Court Oliver Wendell Holmes, when writing the majority opinion in Buck vs Bell, ""Five generations of imbecility are enough.""RIGHT !"
4,"Exquisitely written, exquisitely detailed","There is far more to petroleum geology than I had ever imagined. Deffeyes gives us a discussion of how oil was formed -- and where it is found -- in articulate, lucid, and detailed prose. And the style is what I would expect from an oil man -- very direct, not a hint of hysteria, no fluff, and in places, really quite funny.The book could only have been written by someone intimately familiar with the field, from a practical standpoint and from an academic standpoint. His first points -- the world supply is limited, and it's almost all been found -- are inarguable. His second points -- the production curve is symmetric, and lags the discovery curve by about eleven years -- depend more on economics and are more open to question. Nevertheless, the conclusion remains the same: the party is almost over. Whether it ends in 2004 or 2020 is immaterial.Read the book; think about what it says; and factor its conclusions into your life."
4,oil shortage?,"Very good book. At times is to technical, it requires some background (science in general) to follow it.Anyway a good point to start understanding the real problem of oil (and its possible shortage)."
5,Makes you think,"This text is for a class and at first is a little hard to get into, but it's very informative and really makes you think about where we're going to be as a world and what we should be doing about the shortage of oil."
4,Great book on understanding oil as a business and science,"This is an exceptional book for those looking to understand the current state and modern history of the oil/energy industry and lobby. My only complaint is that it is written from a largely bourgeois background. Nonetheless, it's a really interesting read, you will learn a lot, and the science stands on its own, despite the author's stated background."
3,Not a cookbook exactly...,"This is a book which talks about Helen Nearing's philosophy on cooking (or not cooking)and includes recipes....but not really a thorough cookbook. If you want to know more about raw and vegetarian meals....then this would help. Also good at exploring the philosophy of growing your own, pay as you go etc."
4,Deluxe Adult Hellboy Costume,"Ok, you must know the hand looks nothing like the picture. You must purchase another one somewhere else like I did. The costume turned out great for a while, got some amazing photos and had tons of fun in it but here were the few draw backs. The head piece, you will need double sided tape for the sideburns. I used the kind women use for their clothes and it worked great until the sweat started coming. The head piece gets kind of hot and can cause you to sweat, making the red face paint drip and get everywhere. Just be prepared that the red face paint can get messy but it was tons of fun, haven't done something like that since I was a kid. Also, the belt is drawn on the black shirt which wasn't bad looking but it was weird that the black shirt is attached to the jacket. Would be better it it was separate. Be prepared to get some other accessories like additional face paint, a tail, new arm, and a fake cigar at least."
3,As good as A look inside!,"Von Soltwedel's collection in Late Night Confessions is a continuation and expansion of A look inside. His jabbing phrasing and use of guilt, fear and despair, but holding at times to hope, puts into words what many of us has faced at one time or another in our lives. This work is every bit as good as A look inside.Mark Reid editor1(at)newbookreviews.org"
5,Biography or Ghost Story?,"Wow, in the very first chapter of this book, you feel like you are viewing an episode of Night Gallery. May Mann states Jayne returned from the dead and wanted her best friend May to finish her book because of false stories about Jayne. Blood covers the draft of the book. One questions May's state of mind, when she starts talking about her cat. However, book keeps you entertain with the stories of Jayne's involvement with Anton Lavey, head Satinist. Also, it tells in detail about Jayne's last days, including the car wrecks with Jayne's last lover Sam Brody and the mauling at the zoo of Jayne's son Zoltan. Book keeps you entertain but it is up to you to believe its contents or not. There are many great rare photos of Jayne. I personally enjoy it but treat it like a work of fiction mixed with facts. Recommend this to readers."
1,Spend your money more wisely,"Just starting out at juicing, my recipe book said, buy a cheap model, see how you like the juice, then go from there. Trust me, don't start out cheap. If you have an experience like mine you won't want to juice. This machine was amazingly slow, messy, and a horror to clean up. I have since bought a different juicer that I love and use everyday. This one got one try and has since been banned from the kitchen. Do your research, read the reviews and don't stop here!"
1,Never buy this item,This is the worst product I ever baught.Vey hard to clean. Extraction is not good.
4,Great Chick Lit,"I am so impressed with this book, I've ordered the first one! I loved the characters and the storyline. I thought each story was a wonderful variation on love and the pressures, considerations and feelings we have all felt in one relationship or another. And, while some of it was a little to neat, I've come to expect that with most chick lit books. These stories really felt like different threads of one story about slightly idealized, but fairly realistic life, love and friendships for modern working women."
4,Unique but Higher price doesn't equate to quality,Shipment was quick and beyond expected.I ordered two for granddaughters and they loved them. The sizes are small for repeated wash and drying of children's apparel in household washing and drying machines.Order larger size than normal for standardized sizing and it will be OK.
2,What's With The Size?,"I bought this shirt a few years ago at Walmart and loved it. I was thrilled when I found it here and had to have it. When I got it I realized it was way to big. So I washed it over and over hoping it would get smaller. No such luck. I know it says ""Pre-Shrunk"", but I still had hope. I bought a medium. I should have bought a extra small. Now I am wearing it as a night shirt."
3,Truman Capote Collector Set,"This set contains the movies: In Cold Blood starring Eric Roberts, Sam Neill and Anthony Edwards (doing a brilliant creepy guy) is a made for television movie from 2005 plus Beat The Devil starring Humphrey Bogart. Also included is a compact disc of classical music, 14 tracks all housed in a custom case."
5,Amazing Movie!,"I love this movie!I rented this movie from Blockbuster,and it was a good movie.So I decided to order this movie from Amazon,and it play really good.So Thank you Amazon!I will be ordering more movies in the near future!!!"
3,"Well it isn't Life of Pi, that's for sure","Length:: 8:33 MinsHHH reviews ""Burning Bright"";the animal attack movie from director Carlos Brooks -about a woman, and her autistic brother trapped in a house with a vicious tiger during a hurricane."
1,Burning Dull,"Most people here overrate Burning Bright (2009), it had alot of plot holes, and unbelieveable aspects to it. Although not as cheesy as I thought it would be, it was still dull.Plot shows zero imagination, even by B movie standards and the movie breaks a basic rule by having the tiger crash into doors, climb ladders and turn knobs as though it was a Gremlin.The plot is entirely predictable, and still not enjoyable. The characters are ridiculously shallow, they look like sketch designed to appeal to 13 year old boys. And Briana Evigan does not even show any nipples.This movie is not thrilling, nor is it scary, two things it repeatedly tries to be."
5,A great representation of world music,"It is rare to come across a CD that represents a world culture so well. Every song on the CD is amazing... you'll dance, you'll laugh and you'll remember your first love. I've seen the group in concert and their energy is amazing -- the CD is just as incredible."
2,Hardly a solution!,"Yes, there is a difference when using this but protection is weak and not waterproof. I ended up looking for another anti-fog for my swimming goggles."
4,Great De-Fog,"Nothing works perfectly for the duration of a workout, but this works the best. All the other name-brand products don't work as well. The only downside is that, in order to apply it, the lens must be dry. I usually apply it after my goggles have dried out for a day and then I'm putting them back into my swim bag."
1,useless,"useless. it doesn't work. i put it on the lense and, after 1/2 hr in the water, the lense fogged up like i haven't put the thing on it. i tried it the second time, same result."
5,Does the job,I purchased this shredder over a year ago for a someone else who had been a victim of identity theft and became very paraniod and needed to shredd every piece of mail that came in. Set up was quick and and very easy to use. Does not take up a lot of space and the organizer on top helps keep things in one location. I have not heard of any issues with so it should still be prefoming well.
4,Even shredders get tired.,"This has a small footprint, shreds cleanly and efficiently, but it has a daily shred limit! Whaaat!? Not that I'm going to be Enron-ing it up in my flat, but come on. It has a safety button style auto-off-rev switch that you have to push down to operate, and of course the obligatory ""don't put your face in the shredder"" caution signs etched into the top. Definitely not for tie storage. Oh, and it also shreds credit cards very well. I don't like limitations, but it does pretty well for the cute little thing that it is."
