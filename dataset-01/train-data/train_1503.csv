3,Not A Long-Term Solution,"I agree with one of the other reviewers on this site who asks,""What if you land on the wrong side of your ass? I found this book didn't adequately address the reality of the unemployed situation. I had much better luck with a book on this site called ""Unemployment Boot Camp: Tactics for Suriving and Thriving in the 21st Century,"" by R.A. Long. It offers a lot of suggestions for empowering yourself and acknowledges that you can be unemployed for long periods of time. The books' premise is to gear up for the long haul. ""Unemployment Boot Camp"" makes a substantial case for implementing physical exercise as a means of strengthening your survival skills and looks at the reality of your job-search taking longer than you'd expect. But it also provides candid objectives and options for sustaining yourself until that next golden opportunity comes around."
1,Dont Waste Your Money !,"This author is funny.So what? Losing your job isnt.There is one sample of a resume, one sample of a cover letter.You would be better served getting a copy of all the books in the Five O' Clock club series.The author admits he has no formal training -it is just his opinion(which he thinks very highly of).Better title would be ""Jump Off The Bridge If You Think This Book Will Help You"""
4,Lodge Logic,"I've been looking for a heavy duty griddle/grill as an addition to my current cookware. The Lodge Logic works great. It heats up fast and even. The only issue I have is that it is very heavy, and thus, it makes it very difficult to move from drawer to stove. I've used both side and have found it to work great, with fast and even heating. Having it pre-seasoned is nice but, if you used cast iron cookware before, you already know how to season your cookware. I have an aluminum griddle which is bigger and have grown accustom to the size, so, the size of this griddle/grill is a little small for me. You just have to plan your cooking carefully.Clean up is not bad with the griddle side but the grill side is a little hard. I have yet to find an easy method to clean between the grill lines, short of soaking and then using the scouring pad. I know that this is not good for the grill but I hate to have food stuck on there for the next time."
4,Really Well Made,"I've had this griddle for several months now. It's heavy and really well made. I love that it has a griddle on one side and a grill on the other. It comes already seasoned and is easy to clean, just follow the directions. No soap, hot water and a brush. The reason I'm giving it a 4-star instead of a 5-star rating is that it doesn't heat evenly on my stovetop. I have two large gas burners that I put it over, and the middle of it never gets quite as hot as the ends, so I have to let whatever I'm grilling cook longer if it's in the middle spot. Not a big deal, but with my burners the way that they are, I was expecting it to heat more evenly. It's a great product and I would recommend it to anyone."
2,rusted POS,"At first I really liked this grill. It was heavy duty and fairly easy to clean. I washed it and set it to dry over night. The next day I woke up to a half rusted grill. The rust won't come off, either. I'm not sure what to do, but I was very disappointed."
1,What a waste!,"I was so excited to finally received this grill that I decided to make tandoori chicken and chicken tikka. Unfortunately, I have to remove my smoke detectors battery because they keep going off. I have to serve dinner outside because the house was very smoky for almost 2 hours and it was unbearable. The grill has a lot of caked on residue because I used lots of spices and yogurt that cleaning the darn thing took forever. I thought this would be a good alternative from grilling outdoors specially since Lodge Logic have such good reputation for its cast iron but I think I'll stick to my charcoal grill and I just have to use a lot more mosquito repellant next time."
1,"Doesn't heat evenly, Garbage!!!","I have a glass top stove. Maybe it was just my misfortune but it did not cook evenly, and super hard to clean... Also turns rusty if you wipe down with a wet cloth and don't dry completely."
1,Griddle. Grill,I bought this for my induction cooktop and it works great. Quick delivery--Amazon is the best!!
3,"Okay, not great","Very, very heavy, hard to lift. Difficult to clean. Everything sticks. Had to order special tools to clean this product. Cooks good especially for things like ke-bobs and burgers. Don't believe manuf. when they say ""already seasoned"" - reseason yourself FIRST."
4,GOOD THINGS COME IN LARGE PACKAGES,"I HAVE ENJOYED MY NEW GRIDDLE/GRILL VERY MUCH. I USED THE GRIDDLE SIDE SEVERAL TIMES BUT HAVEN'T USED THE GRILL SIDE YET. MY PANCAKES AND FRENCH TOAST COME OUT PERFECT. THE GRIDDLE CLEANS EASILY. ON THE CON SIDE, IT SEEMS TO TAKE A BIT LONG FOR THE AREA NOT OVER A BURNER TO HEAT UP BUT ONCE THAT AREA DOES HEAT UP, IT, TOO, PRODUCES A NICE, GOLDEN BROWN. MY GREATEST COMPLAINT IS THE WEIGHT OF THE GRIDDLE/GRILL. IT IS QUITE HEAVY THUS MAKING IT HARD TO HANDLE WHEN CLEANING AND STORING, ESPECIALLY FOR ME AS I STORE IT ON A SHELF THAT IS OVER MY HEAD SO LIFTING IT TO THE SHELF TAKES A GOOD BIT OF STRENGTH."
4,It's OK but,"I like it, it's what I expected but I have 2 complaints. 1- the food sticks to the pan even though I followed instructions & it was pre-seasoned.2- you cannot move it after cooking because the handles are part of the griddle."
3,Adequately covers 2 burners,"I got this griddle over the smaller size available as I wanted more surface area to cook on. The problem with this griddle is that there are large raised margins along each side and I don't understand the purpose as it cuts down on cooking surface.I do really like cast iron cookware, and have no complaints about the quality or sturdiness of this item. I just wished they had used a different design."
2,"Arrived with bubbling, peeling surface....twice.","I was very excited to receive this griddle after reading all of the positive reviews.Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed was that a big black bubble on the cooking surface. I touched it with my finger and it tore off, exposing the bare iron beneath.I tried to cook with it anyways, knowing that I was going to send it back for a replacement.I made pancakes in the morning and burgers at night. The results were a mixed bag.The surface may be slightly non-stick, but it's certainly not on par with a high quality non-stick surface. My pancakes stuck even though I slightly greased the surface. It performed poorly for pancakes.Dinner was a different story. Cooking burgers on this thing is a dream. No complaints there.My second griddle just arrived today. There are multiple big cooking surface bubbles on this one. Maybe Amazon got a bad batch, maybe Lodge Logic's quality has fallen off. Either way, I recommend avoiding this griddle."
4,Very Heavy!,"I was suprized at how heavy this item is. You will need to season it every time you use it before cooking and after cleaning. I use this pan at least twice a week and after cleaning and scrubing so many times, the black color has come off a little on the gridle side. It now has grey/silver in a few places. The pan also takes a long time to cool off before you can clean it and I think this is why the food sticks. I have stared to pour a little water on the pan while it is still hot to let it pre-soak."
1,Did not work well with my electric stove top.,"I love my cast iron pans. I was hoping I would love this too. I don't.Pros:It does cook satisfactorily.Cons:Burner edges peek out from either end of this griddle. It doesn't cover the burners well (left/right or up/down).Significant pre-heating required to use.Burner settings are very high to get a decent cooking temperature.Temperature on the surface is uneven no matter what the burner settings.(Worst problem) It discolors the stove top cooking surface requiring elbow grease and soapy steel scouring pads to clean. No amount of stove cleaning has fixed this problem.This griddle may work well for gas stoves or barbecue grills, but I don't know. It does not work well for my electric stove top. I am going to buy some heat diffusers and give this griddle another try. I do not have high hopes.Update: 2/11/2012 - Heat diffusers improved performance only very slightly, but not enough to rate another star. Gas stove/grill has not been tested."
5,My wife loves it.,My wife wanted a 2 burner griddle. I gave it to her a week ago and she's used this griddle everyday for the past week. She is very happy with it.
3,It's ok,"I purchased this with the idea that the cast-iron would heat uniformly across 2 electric burners on my stove and it doesn't. It still works well, but not as I had hoped."
4,Use just one side,"I love this griddle, but I want to mention that I have tried to use both sides of the griddle and found that my gas burner will burn the seasoning off the bottom. So I use it for making pancakes on the flat side and avoid cooking things on the ridged side to save the non-stick surface from being ruined. Not sure why there is such a variety of these reversible griddles, the putting fire to the seasoning removes it."
2,I am returning,"I did see other reviews that I might have trouble fitting on stove but after measuring w/measurements given this would fit fine (b/c it is longer and a bit wider than typical griddles). I have gas stove top - circular burners....it did not fit / sit level on the burners, therefore cooking pancakes, eggs or anything of that nature is out of the question. :( very sad. I needed maybe 1/4 inch more. Back to searching for one that will fit. Otherwise - it had good weight, loved that you could flip and have another cooking surface. There was a collection/bubble of the commercial finish they applied on one of the corners - I think it was just a fluke that mine had that, but....thought I would put it out there."
4,Heavy...,"Purchased this item as Christmas present for wife. Although she has not had the opportunity to use it yet, she likes it. Unfortunately, the item is heavy and she really has difficulty in handling it. The company selling it did not package the item well and it arrived with an open package."
4,A little sticky,"Another new item from Lodge to me. Really made well and quite heavy which I like. Only four stars because the factory seasoning sucked. I'll re-season and this will last a life time. Just one more thing, we had a little problem with sticking but in the end the food was delicious grilled this way and it was much nicer than standing out in the snow grilling. Good Grill/Griddle."
3,gift for my husband,My husband put this on his Christmas list after having a really great steak at someone else's house. So far we've mostly used it for pancakes though. You have to be careful that the batter doesn't run into the gutter. We bought the larger one without thinking it through very well; it is too big to be stored in our broiler.
2,A Sticking Griddle,"Disappointed with this griddle. It s somewhat unwiedly for an eldery person due to its weight, but the real problem is food that will not release like fried eggs and pancakes. The Lodge Logic fry pans I have work great but the griddle doesn't."
4,Great Griddle!,"I have only used the griddle side so far - to cook pancakes and hash browns. It's a great cook surface. Pancakes and potatoes cook evenly on this griddle and it's been easy to care for. I haven't any problems with food sticking on the griddle. The only problem I have with this griddle is that because of the way the griddle is designed, at least two inches of the griddle surface can't be used because there's like a lip on one side and like a grease trough on the other side. Since my primary purpose for using the griddle is for pancakes I have to make smaller ones or fewer."
4,Really like it except.....,"I really like this griddle and have enjoyed using it. The only issue I had was as others have commented on, it didn't sit even on my gas burners due to the handle cut outs. The griddle would teeter totter on the grates. The solution I used for this was to use two of myLodge Logic Pre-Seasoned 8-Inch Cast-Iron Meat Rack/Trivetbetween the griddle and the grate over the gas burner. Worked well for me and stabilized the the griddle. The griddle was a perfect size for my range. The factory seasoning is OK. With a little cooking it gets good, or clean it off and season it yourself. With this one I got lazy and just cooked on it with things that where greasy/oily and it turned out good after some use. I would buy it again but with my setup I'd have to have the meat rack/trivets (which are a good product too)."
3,Needs practice,"This product takes a little getting used to. First, you must heat it using low flame on gas burners. Second, it must be kept well oiled during and after use. The griddle is good and heavy thus retaining heat well. It is important to use a large wide spatula when making pancakes or they will tend to fall apart when being turned. You must remember this is not a non-stick surface like an electric griddle. Once you have mastered the idiosyncracies of the griddle you will find it works well."
5,Great Griddle,This is a great griddle which fits perfectly on top of the two burner grates of our Thermador range. And it is way less expensive than the Thermador or the Le Creuset ones we looked at as well. With the free shipping on this fairly heavy item you just can't beat this deal.
3,durable,"This pan is great for pancakes, but I find that for grilling meat and veggies it is a little smoky. maybe I have the heat too high? Anyway, I probably should have got the smaller, single burner grill pan. But this one is really durable and maybe in the summer, with the windows open it will be better... or even atop the gas grill so veggies and shrimps don't fall in. Overall, this is definitely well worth the price."
3,Unbearable heaviness of grilling,"Makes a great burger according to my eight year old son who is an expert at eating them. Definitely a welcome addition in the kitchen, but a few caveats are in order. First of all it is very heavy - two hands required to lift it.Don't buy it if you have a porcelain sink as you will have to rest it against the side to clean it and you will scratch your sink. You also may want to measure the distance between your burners. It does not fit perfectly on mine and it has to be shifted toward the front in order to lay flat."
2,Extremely hard to clean,"I've used iron skillets for years, but this one is particularly hard to clean. The grooves that allow you to get really nice grill marks also serve to keep you from cleaning well. If you use any marinade, such as BBQ sauce, orange juice, or vinegar based sauces, that marinade will eat away part of the seasoning. That happens with any iron skillet or pan, but with the exposed grooves, it's really bad. Also, it's difficult to scrub where the grooves meet the pan, because it's a 90 degree angle. So, if you don't mind scrubbing down to iron and needing to reseason each time you use the griddle, it'll work well.It's a substantial piece of cooking equipment. I have gas burners, and it heats evenly enough to be useful. I like the fact that I can have some cooler sections of the cooking top (cooler, but still very hot). I can see alot of uses for this griddle and maybe the flat top is better to clean. However, the problem cleaning the grill top means it's not useful for me."
3,too small for a double burner pan,"the cooking area on these pans is roughly 25% less than the dimensions listed. those are the outside dimensions. you lose around 3"" on the long side and 2"" on the short which brings the cooking area down 25% from the listed dimensions. you get very little extra room compared to a single burner large square pan."
4,could have a deeper lip,"I'm a big fan of cast iron as a whole. This two sided griddle is great, especially on a wood burning stove with it's uniform heat source. When laid across 2 burners on the stovetop you'll have some temperature differentials, plan accordingly. The one complaint I have has to do with the exterior lip. It should be deeper on the griddle side. When cooking bacon for scouts the grease trap fills up too fast. It should also have a pouring lip for the grease trap."
2,Cast Iron Grill,"I'm not as happy with this product as I thought I'd be. It's my own fault because I didn't pay attention to the weight. It's about 15 pounds, and that's just to heavy for me to handle."
4,Great to keep on the grill,"I got this guy mid summer and wish I had purchased it sooner. Just keep it on the grill and season it. Leave it there, but clean it regularly. It is great for searing burgers and steaks. It maintains high heat for a long time once up to temperature. The it camping and throw it right on the fire/ coals for a quick way to grill."
3,It's ok..,"Heats unevenly. Or maybe it's just my (electric) stove. Either way, the griddle only gets hot directly above the burners, the middle of the griddle gets warm but not enough to actually cook anything there. I've tried different temperature settings, different pre-heating and warming times, different pairs of burners, everything possible. Maybe it would work better on a gas stove..So far I've only used it to make grilled cheese sandwiches and pancakes. And I've only used the smooth side, not the grill side. The last time I used it for pancakes, they stuck and nearly all burned because I had to pry them off, even though I had sprayed it with cooking spray like usual. Perhaps it needs to be seasoned again.Overall it's an ""ok"" griddle. It's my first griddle, so I can't really compare it to anything. It could probably be better, but it could probably also be a lot worse. But I don't think I would recommend this one.."
2,I prefer my electric skillet,"I bought this to replace an existing cast iron skillet based on the rave reviews. After months of trying, I have never been able to cook anything well. I thought it was just me so I had others try and they had the same reaction. I know I only need low heat because at medium heat anything I put on it smoked up the house, but anything from pancakes to chicken breasts came out inconsistent or stuck on the pan. After only a few months I have many rust spots despite cleaning it with a steel grill brush and drying it by hand. I replaced mine with a $30 electric skillet and love it."
4,"Great griddle, quite heavy","I was looking for a griddle to replace the cheaper aluminum one I used to have with its non-stick surface. This product fills the bill! The only real drawback for some is that it is heavy. Not an issue for me. It fits well over my two burners and takes some time to heat up. However, once at temperature it does a great job and I found it quite easy to clean."
4,Great for Pancakes!,This griddle has made a huge difference in our pancakes. Cooks evenly eventhough it's a bit heavy it's worth it.
4,Great Value,"Functionality, it was exactly what i was expecting. Produces quite a bit of smoke while cooking, but i think it's a user issue. Cleaning is nothing unexpected.All-in-all it was what i was looking for at a great price. I'm happy :)"
4,Overall a good purchase,"I've read a lot of reviews before I purchased this griddle. Yes, it does take a little time to heat up, but as one review stated, ""put it on the burners before you start your food prep and it will be up to temp by the time you want to use it."" I have a glass top range with a bridging element; it takes around 5 minutes to warm up. Also remember you can turn the burners off at least a minute before your food is done cooking. The size is a plus, it covers the burners perfectly. The down side, the reason I didn't rate it 5 Stars, is the grease channel on each side of the griddle, it is too wide. The 1/2"" - 3/4"" grease channel on each side takes away too much potential cooking surface; it could have been made with narrower channels.Overall the griddle is a good buy."
4,Decent Grill,"I really like this for jobs that won't fit in a cast-iron ""frying"" pan, so I don't have to make things in stages. But, like most cast-iron, you're going to need to season it to make it non-stick. I don't care what the description says above - this grill and all other cast-iron needs work to make it get that sheen and nice non-stick finish. I made chapatis first and it worked well, but I could see that this was going to take some uses (maybe 10 or so, with washing afterwards with hot water and steel wool, drying right away, and oiling all over) to be useful for pancakes and other items. I made tempeh today, and it came out great.The downside, besides the expected work with seasoning, is putting the item away. It's fairly large; I simply put it on its side, wrapped in parchment paper (to catch excess oil and not scratch my white cabinets), and put it in the cabinet."
3,"Affordable, but a little bigger would be nice...","I chose this over the Le Creuset version based on all of the reviews for both. I had an old Caphalon griddle that was great, but the non stick was wearing out.I'm not going to cover cast iron vs non-stick--that's a personal preference, but I will mention you have to follow the instructions to avoid having food stick.What the reviews failed to mention was how much of the area was taken up by the grease collectors. The cooking surface isn't quite big enough for bacon strips, and definitely not big enough for a regular sized tortillas. It'll work, but part of the item you're cooking will be hanging off the cooking surface. If Lodge Logic had a version that was a tiny bit bigger and got rid of the grease collection slot, then I'd give it 5 stars."
2,Heavy metal,"I found this grill to be to heavy. It made it hard for cleaning. While I didnt use cleanser as it recommended for cleaning, I did use water and a brush and now its rusted. To cumbersome for me. I have stopped using it."
2,And I thought I was high maintenance...,"This product was great while it lasted. Grilled my chicken to perfection. Make sure to clean it right away after using it or else you will exert all your focus and energy trying to clean it later. DO NOT, I REPEAT IT, DO NOT leave it in the sink. EVER. Rookie move on my behalf, with the rust and all, but nonetheless taking care of it is too much to handle."
2,too heavy,It is way too heavy unless you never move it once it is down. It also does not clean as easy as they say. It does cook well however - but for me too big and too heavy and needs to clean easier- especially since you cannot move it.
2,Regard your intentions,"My maid is going to wonder what the hell I did this weekend to make such a mess of the kitchen. Well, I cooked Jaimacan jerk chicken on a Lodge stove top grill. I have a number of Lodge products for frying, stewing and baking, and I love them. This one though is going to father Joe as a donation."
3,Heavy and it doesn't seem clean no matter how hard I scrub,Like the way things cook on this but it is so heavy. Great if you like cast iron skil lets.
4,Not so good for a small family and flat ceramic cooktop,"I am hispanic and own the traditional round ""comal"" that I use to grill chicken, steak and vegetables. I bought this thinking that it would be useful to have a larger size. We are a family of two and found that it was too large for us and the small size is much more convenient. Seems also that with ceramic cooktop (electric) the heat is not dispersed well and it burns the center items and the outer items dont get cooked at all. I will give this to my sister, since she has a family of 4 and gas range. I also bought the grill press and I am keeping that since that proved useful for the comal."
5,Cast iron grill/griddle,"I ordered this for my husband who is a chef, for Father's Day. He loves it. He uses it all the time. It can be used on the stove top and also on the grill outside. It's kind of a pain to clean, but I think that's true of anything cast iron."
4,Great for pancakes & french toast,"We use this griddle ALL the time! We turn to this heavy duty griddle whenever we are cooking up pancake/french toast for the family. It sits right on top of our gas range & we are able to cook 2 pancakes at once. We have tried the other side for burgers, but prefer to use a flat pan instead. The rippled griddle side is more time consuming to clean up than a flat pan. Love that nothing sticks to it. Would definately purchase again---as matter of fact--I have purchased it again as a gift for another family member!"
5,perfect!,"This is exactly what I needed. I had been using an electric griddle for years but was worried about the chemicals from the nonstick surface leaching into my food. Other griddles were so expensive, I didn't want to pay the price to find out if I liked cast iron. THis is perfect. It was a great price and works fabulously..who needs expensive models?!"
5,A necessity for the kitchen.,"This product is great for burgers, steaks, and sandwiches. You can't beat cast iron. It's heavy! But, it is well worth your purchase."
5,"Great, Awesome",i bought one of these i also own a Anolon grill . Its very heavy but its worth the weight. I recommend it to anyone. nice price also.
2,Great grill until it Cracked,"I have owned this grill for about one year and have enjoyed using it for steak, chicken and burgers. It was used only about once or twice per month. Unfortunately, today it developed a large crack while pre-heating. The crack started on the grease-well side and immediately advanced 2/3 of the way across the grill. I expected more from this product based on the reviews. Perhaps most reviews are written shortly after receiving the product."
5,theundercoversnoot@yahoo.com,"This is the second cast iron cookware I have gotten. I was worried about it breaking like some people had happen to them with electric stoves. So I heated it up slow, so slow. I have not had a single problem with it. I have not used the grill side as of yet. After seasoning it 3 times in a row it is not stick as my nonstick cookware.Everyone should buy one of these."
2,"Cooking surface is only 16.5"" between handles!!","The listed cooking surface dimensions of 19x10 do not include the large inset handles. This brings the cooking surface down to 16.5, which on a Viking stove means you can only cover about 75% of each burner. It works on a viking, but not very efficiently and with the added bonus of having flames shoot up through the handles.I love my other Lodge pans and I'm sure this is of equal quality, it's just not suited for larger cook tops."
3,Need to re-season,I think the product is fine but it needs to be re-seasoned. I love cast iron and particularly older or vintage cast iron because the seasoning takes so well. It's like using a non-stick product. I used the Lodge griddle one time and knew right away it needed to be re-seasoned unless you don't have a problem with soap and a scrub brush.
4,"Works great, but heavy","I bought this about four years ago and have used it several times. It fits over two burners and cooks well. I only gave it four stars because it is so heavy, which is a common trait for all cast iron products. I really do love cast iron, but this is a bit hard to clean properly because of its size and weight. I have since purchased a smaller cast iron grill and a separate griddle. Since there is only two of us, these works better for most applications. I do recommend that you season it before using it and after each time it is used. After washing, I put it on a medium heat, coat it lightly with oil using a paper towel, let it heat for a few minutes, then wipe it clean and cool it down before storing it again. When I have used the procedure that Lodge recommends, my cast iron has become gummy. This works great!"
4,Barbi or toasting,"This griddle/grill does a great job both grilling on one side and toasting or making pancakes or whatever on the other. Make sure to use some non stick spray on the grill before using, clean-up on that side can be a pain if you don't. It does get quite smokey in the kitchen, unfortunatly I do not have a hood with fan over my stove so the windows need to be open, but it's still worth the coughing 'cause the meat comes out soooo good."
3,Cast Iron Griddle,"This works okay. I am still trying to get the burners adjusted correctly and it is not completed seasons, so food is still sticking. I just need to use to it more to figure this out. The quality is exceptional compared to other griddles costing the same."
3,Grill side good,"As the title says,...the grillside is good; things cooked on the flat side might fare better in individual steel/iron pans (omelets,pancakes,etc). Must reseason grill periodically..still a good product...just a bit heavey/clumsey for storage in a small kitchen. Grill side is GOOD!!!"
3,sticky grill,"This item is not as good as I had hoped. I am hoping that after repeated use it will improve. Everything sticks, somethings worse than others, but I am going to keep it and continue to ""season"" and use it in the hopes it improves."
1,Not for Electric Ranges,I would not recommend this product for electric ranges where you are covering two different size burners and need to get even consistant heat.
1,Very hard to use and clean,"I was so excited about the dual griddle/ grill feature, but I do not like this pan one bit. It does not cook evenly, and it is a bear to clean. When it comes in contact with the slightest amount of water, it completely rusts and stains everything around it. It is going to collect dust in the back of my cabinet."
3,Too heavy,"I knew it weighed 16 lbs when I ordered it but I did not realize how heavy it is until I actually lift the item. On a daily basis, I could not see myself appreciating it due to its weight. There is a smaller 10 lb one which I might order instead. Had to pay $13 to ship it back. Return process was easy, my payment was credited back to me on time."
2,too much smoke,how do i get this thing to stop smoking up my house? i seasoned it yet it still smokes up the entire house.
3,I hold out hope....,"We bought this for a campout with our Cub Scout Den. We didn't season it, since it came ""pre-seasoned"", but I'm not so sure. When we tried to make pancakes over a charcoal fire, they stuck to the griddle surface terribly! We ended up using my $10 cheap Coleman griddle top instead and that was perfect and NON-STICK.We'll try seasoning this again, and see if that helps, but I sure hope it works better in the future....especially for the price. Otherwise, I'll got get another Coleman griddle at Walmart for half the cost!"
1,I do not like me for anything,"This palncha is very heavy and difficult to clean, in addition it oxidizes, for my it was a bad(wrong) choice(election)."
4,Great piece for professional results at home...,"This product is great for cooking so many different things. The heat is even, and strong. The construction of the item is top notch. However, if you're looking for a light-weight, easy-to-clean, fits in a drawer kind of grill/griddle, make another choice. It may be heavy, and it may not fit in my kitchen sink, but man, the food that comes off of it is SO worth it."
3,good if you like cast iron weight,weight was more then i expected. Good pan. Did not like handles to much. Cooks well.
2,Disappointed cast-iron fan....,"We are both experienced cast-iron users and really looked forward to another terrific Lodge product.Unfortunately, despite extra-long pre-heating times, we've found that this griddle/grill does not cook evenly - hot spots directly over the burners and cool spots everywhere else. I really expected this to work well on my Wolf AG range using two burners.And, despite all of our usual cast-iron care, it is rather a bit stickier (not as ""non-stick"") than I expected (this is our first pre-seasoned purchase). This I could live with, but the uneven heating I can't.Very disappointing."
1,uneven cooking,"Every time I cooked on this thing, the food cooked unevenly. Whatever was closest to the fire would burn and the things not directly over the heat source, gas, wouldn't even cook.The pan never heated up evenly, so I had a mess when I made pancakes. I mean who wants a half-cooked pancake?"
4,A Great Cast Iron Griddle,"I bought this Griddle a while ago,and must say,it's great! the dimensions are great,Eggs,bacon,wont stick,everything fries great in this pan,already seasoned is awsome also.Plus you don't have the chemicals,like in those no stick pans.These cast iron griddles will last a lifetime!"
4,Gets better and better,"I have had several other griddles and about 18 months was about it before they were toast. This one is built to last. I use it about every day. It does most things well but where it shines is browning the food. Nothing does it like cast iron. You can move it to the grill if you need to or pop it in the oven as well. It does not heat totally even so you have to keep that in mind and keep the food moving. I just pour off the grease when I am done and let it cool a bit. I squirt some Dawn on it and rinse it off while giving it a little work with a dish brush. I can clean it in 30 seconds or less. The thing I like best is the more you use it, the better it cooks. That is good because I suspect it will be around for 100 years or so."
5,Great Product,Bought this for my girlfirend and shes loves it its great because she can cook food all at once and we can eat together without it getting cold because of waiting I recommend this product
4,"Lodge Logic Pro 20 x 10 7/16"" Cast Iron Grill/Griddle","It is a great product for grilling. I grilled vegetables and meat with it. It is as good as grilling outdoors. The only drawback is the smokeit emits. The kitchen smelled of smoke for hours after I finished, eventhough I had the fan going during the cooking.It is also heavy, being cast iron, but you can overlook that."
4,"Great grill, but not for the frail","This grill is incredible! I love the built in handles, the grease channel, and most of all -the results! I love the pre-seasoning and don't feel like it's a compromise on the quality of traditional cast iron. But fair warning: this thing is HEAVY & unweildy in the sink, and for that reason, a little hard to clean. I still love using it. Perfect as well for the urban indoor grillmaster!"
5,wonderful product,"This product is fantastic. Replaces my old aluminum one that had significant chipping.Would highly recommend to anyone, it's top quality. Fast delivery too! Love amazon will definitely buy from you again.Thanks."
4,Great cast iron grill,"Hey It isn't outside, but it does the job. It sears, great grill marks, cooks evenly and I couldn't be more pleased. Beats $70 at William S(expensive)onoma.Be prepared though. It's heavy s my wife said it looks cool enough to leave on the stove-top when we aren't using it. Buy it, you won't be disappointed. Lodge has a great outdoor charcoal gill too. Also very heavy, but if you take care of it it's superb"
5,Great Griddle,"Well seasoned, nice size and substantial, this griddle/grill works well on my new gas stove. It fits over two burners."
4,It works for me,"This product is working perfectly for me so far, it took a little getting use to the hot surface temperatures but I'm figuring it out the more I use it. I would have given this product 5 stars but some items I prepare stick to the non-stick surface, which is a pain to scrub because I don't want to damage the surface."
4,Lodge Griddle,"Nice quality griddle. A little narrow for me due to built in drip well but is as described. Used on my gas grill several times for fahitas. Primarily though I bought to replace the cast aluminum griddle with non stick coating that came with my electric range for use with burners bridged. Did not like the nonstick coating on the old one, that stuff scares me. This one is safer to use then that toxic non stick stuff and performs better. The new cast iron Lodge one worked well for multiple pancakes at one time without sticking. Also do multiple grill cheeses at one time. No complaints from the kids."
3,Meh,"I love Lodge cast iron cookware, however this one is not a 5 star item. The cooking is uneaven (I have a full lenght gas burner under this when heating/cooking) it may be too thin to develop a nice even cooking surface or just move your pancakes around a lot."
1,"STICKING, CHIPPING - BOUGHT AS A CHRISTMAST GIFT AND NOW DON'T HAVE THE OPTION TO RETURN","I Bought this item for my sons girlfriend in Oct because I shop early for Christmas. It is supposed to already be seasoned, but it was sticking so bad she had to use soap to clean and something was chipping off the grill. That can't be too healthy, have to wonder what ended up in her food. So she looked online to see how to season it thinking that might help and it doesn't. She says everthing sticks to it really bad. Now I am trying to return it for her and it's past the time and can't return. Not a good policy especially for Christmast Gifts."
5,Typical Lodge Quality,"If you like Lodge's pans, you'll probably appreciate the quality and weight of this griddle. I love that it's multi-purpose with two sides, so you're not storing two separate items. We use it primarily to cook home made tortillas two at a time, and it rests perfectly over two of our gas burners to reach a high temperature. Clean it just like any other cast iron pan (no soap) and it will last forever."
5,Exactly What I Was Needing,This is made of great construction and very sturdy. I couldn't ask for a better Griddle. I Just ordered one for My Dad for fathers day. We both love cast iron cookware. And you have to know how to take care of cast iron in order to use it....
3,grill/griddle use,I used the grill/griddle twice for grilling steaks. That was a mistake to do in the house. There was smoke every where. I have not tried it for anything else but if the results are the same the only thing it is good for is camping. The only good thing is that it made in the USA. That is why it got a 3 star.
4,Quite solid indeed!!,This grill is definitely made to withstand the out door grilling. I actually bought it for my stove which is almost to heavy for it. It is a well made product.
4,"Like it, but it's hard to clean...","I've wanted one of these griddle/grill pans for years. Finally broke down and bought one and was excited to use it. As far as cooking on it, it was great. The only downside is clean-up... Obviously, since you're not supposeto use soap on these pans, clean-up is easiest when the pan is warm/hot. Because this pan is so big and heavy, it's nearly impossible to try to clean it while it's warm/hot without burning yourself. As such, it's nearly impossible to get it completely clean because you're trying to wash a cool pan without soap.. Cooking with it is great, but clean-up is a definite drag."
5,Best Indoor Grill,"This grill is great for grilling burger, chicken and steak inside during winter. Flip it over and make great pancakes or eggs."
3,"Great taste, too smoky for indoors, forget about fish","I actually love the grill marks that it creates and the taste of the grilled food, especially chicken and steak. Making fish was a nightmare. It really stuck to the grill and was aweful to clean. I was really looking forward to eating more grilled fish. My other main complaint is that is creates way too much smoke. I have to put on the exhaust fan and have all of the windows and doors open and it still smokes up the house. So I may use it only outdoors, which defeats my entire purpose. I definitely can't use it during the winter."
2,too small for my stove,"My stove is 30 inches wide, which I believe is standard. The two eyes are 22 inches apart. This item is only 20 inches wide which includes the handles. It needs to be about 6 inches wider to fit my stove. Other than that, it looks real nice. It is sturdy and apears to have an excellent seasoning .. But I had to send it back because it was too small."
4,Good product but buy elsewhere!,I actually ordered 4 items and specifically asked they be shipped together. The seperated th order then tried to charge my card twice for 2 different amounts instead of the one I authorised. Oddly enough my bank denied the second charge. They told me they couldn't take my bank payment(but didn't explain). Then after much poor customer service we agreed to send a money order and they emailed me an invoice for the full amount. Just prior to sending my money order I checked my bank. That's when I found out that they had already taken payment for part of the order but they sent me an invoice for the full amount. I canceled the rest of the order and will never ever shop at Amazon again. BTW the single worst online buying experience I have had in 15 years!!!!
4,stove top grill,Love using this grill! The grill marks on the food without having to wait for the outdoor grill to get hot is great!
2,Lousy Griddle on Electric Stove,"The griddle side heats unevenly, probably due to 1) The ridged bottom, and 2) existence of electric coils on the stove, rather than a flame. This doesn't change, no matter how long you preheat. Pancakes aren't evenly colored.Perhaps the ridged side works better, because then the smooth side would be against the coils."
2,I wanted to like it,but it just didn't work well. The heating was very inconsistent from one end to the next. It was even inconsistent within a 8 inch radius on the griddle. Made it very difficult to make pancakes. Half of the pancake would be cooked and the other half would be completely uncooked. Broke down and bought a plug in griddle last month.
3,My fault,I should have known it would be too heavy for me - and I'm having trouble with sticking. The product itself is as advertised - and with a new owner it will be great.
3,"Makes your stove dirty, and it's a bit big.","This works as well as any other Lodge cast-iron pans (which some people will say is not very good at all, but it never gave me any problems.) However, it is a little too heavy for what we need. If you're making 4 burgers at a time, this is what you're looking for. If you're making 2, like me, then the Lodge Logic 12-in skillet works just fine, and there's no reason to drag out this giant slab of iron that requires two heat sources.This is very big, very heavy, and very sturdy, but my other complaint about it is when you try to use one side, the other side is dripping oil onto the stove. Eww. Then the stove gets sticky and hard to clean. I bought this after I got an 10.1-inch and a 12-inch skillet, thinking it's just as awesome, but I honestly rarely use this.I imagine we'll still use it to grill things, but I should have gone with a smaller grill too."
4,Cast Iron Stove Top Griddle,"We've used only once since purchasing, but are very pleased with it. Seemed to require no ""seasoning"" as many former cast materials did. Nice large cooking surface, great tool for several different breakfast (and other?) foods....."
4,Great Griddle,"We've had our griddle for 3 weeks and love it. Purchasing it through Amazon resulted in a 40% savings over local stores. It comes pre-seasoned, thus minimizing the sticking characteristics of ""raw"" cast iron. Our worries about using similar, chemically treated griddles have now been eliminated, plus we have the convenience of a larger cooking surface!"
1,What happened to Nuno?,"It seems that Nuno.. one of the best guitarists of all-time, has forgotten how to play guitar. Not good stuff.. not at all. (...)I used to listen to a song with Nuno in it and I was like..(...), there's a month out of my life trying to learn one song!"" Now.. I hear this new stuff and I'm confident I could learn every song all in one day. How a musician can have every song be so good on every album... form a different group and have every song sound awful, I will never know... quite strange. The melody is gone.. and the cool riffs are no more. If you want to hear Nuno, save your money here and go buy some old Extreme CDs."
5,Incredible CD.,"This CD is incredible, but I do not know why it is not promoted in the USA. Nuno has almost forgotten about his fans in America. It seems as if he is only focused on Asian fans.It is good to hear music from Nuno.Great CD!"
4,Loved It But Not as Much as Schizophonic,"If you loved Schizophonic, you'll like Population 1.Population 1 is heartfelt, eclectic, funky, hard rockin', poppy and insightful at its best and a bit verbally confusing & uninspiring and at its worse. If he tours in the US with this release, I would WITHOUT A DOUBT go to the show to hear him perform these songs. Although, each song is a bit of a downer lyrically."
2,Different This Time Around,"Nuno takes a different approach with his new CD Population 1. The really are not any funky grooves, no great solos, nothing that sounds like Mourning Widows or Extreme. The CD starts off with Flow a song with no guitar at all and then goes in to Spaceman a bluesy sounding thing with bad lyrics. High is one of the few bright spots on this CD it has some heaver guitars and a pretty cool groove. Un Happy B-Day has to be the worst thing Nuno has ever written, it sounds like a bad Prince song.I have been a Nuno fan since the first Extreme record and I tried to like it but I just can't. If none of us waste our 30 dollars this time around maybe Nuno will remeber he is a guitar player next time around."
4,Good - Could do Better,"First of all, this is a good album. But that's the problem. It's good - not great. Population 1 is nowhere near the genius of Schizophonic, and is a bit of a let down. Make no mistake, there are some great songs on this album, but there's also too much in-depth, look-at-me-I-am-serious-artist type songs which lets it down.It'll take a while to like it, but it will grow on you. The sooner Extreme egt back together the better, that's what I say!"
4,best production and voice but not Nuno's best album !,"This album sounds very different from the others albums. It's sound like a mix of the first Mourning Widows album, Schizophonic and the Waiting for the punchline album. Flow, Space, High (Waiting for the punchline sounding) Iron Jaw, Ordinary day (Confrontation sounding)are some of the tracks here worth listening to but the best songs to my mind are Unhappy Birthday and Stiff. Very weird and original songs.Very Good album but not his best album. Check out Schizophonic and the first Mourning Widows album to see what the guy can do."
5,Great Notebook,"Excelent notebook, very less of weight, practical for carry anywhere in the office and home."
4,Young children will be amazed,"On every page of this book, children will find a great mix of animals squawking, squealing, honking, tweeting, croaking, trumpeting, screeching, barking, purring, roaring, yipping, and bleating. The animals are depicted in many various situations. For example, the bears are eating and one is running away from bees. Kids will love looking at all the pictures and imitating the sounds as written. A perfect book for those children who are enamoured with animals."
2,very disappointing,50 trade secrets did not help me with my design. It is good if you like to look at pretty pictures.
2,A little small; warped after one trip thru dishwasher,"One bunch of asparagus filled it up; I was hoping for a little more capacity. The steamed asparagus was delicious although I overcooked it a little (this thing is FAST). Washed in dishwasher, top rack on heated dry overnight and when I took it out this morning the parts didn't quite fit any more - some warping after just one use. Glad I didn't pay a lot! I'm sold on the concept though."
2,Good Steamer/Cooker - With a Major Flaw,"I've had this steamer for almost a year now and it has proven to be sturdy. I use it primarily for veggies, but have used it for chicken, fish, and bacon. I don't recommend using it for bacon, as it will warp the insert. I like the slide covered vent in the cover.In the picture on Amazon it appears the cover has a tab on it to aid in removing the lid. This is not the case. The lid fits into a groove in the base quite snugly. This is good for cooking, but makes it a bit difficult to remove the cover when it is hot out of the microwave. The major defect is this: if you want to use it as a regular cooking dish, without the steamer insert you will find the cover doesn't fit, but balances on the rim. The insert sits on the lip of the dish and the aforemetioned groove in the steaming insert is the same size as the dish rim. IMO this is a major design flaw.Because of the two issues with the cover I wouldn't buy this again."
2,Arrived broken,"Arrived with a crack around the top, despite being very well packed. Too small anyway for my uses. Sent item back for a refund."
3,I can steam more items in my Ziploc Steam bags!,"This steamer worked good. If you want to use it for small quantities and you do not mind having to clean it after use, you will like it just fine. I have only used mine twice, since I can steam more vegetable at one time in the Ziploc Steam bags and have no clean up at all. When I ordered this product, I was hoping there was a little more space between the lid and the steam tray. It did not turn out to be so. That is the only fault I found with this steamer."
4,almost perfect,i love this item.. i think its a great idea. easy to use.. just needs a tighter lid. i got it on sale in a store for half the price but i would get again!
2,Quality not that great,The lid gets so 'soft' after 4 minutes in the microwave (had the vent open to allow steam to exit). Sometimes I wonder how much of this 'soft' plastic is leaking...Didn't like this product compared to the previous one from another brand I had (which was just a few more bucks at amazon). Next time will purchase the brand I know that I can trust instead of trying new ones.
2,This product is a piece of crap,This is a piece of garbage. I used it once to microwave steam vegetables and the damn thing warped. Neither the insert nor the cover will now fit back on the base. It is now useless and will be thrown out with the trash.It should also be noted that I also ordered the Nordic brand version of the microwave veggie/fish steamer and it works beautifully. It has not warped with use and it cooks the food wonderfully.My experience has shown that Progressive microwave cookware is junk while Nordic is a reliable brand.
2,Disappointed,Go this one to replace a broken Nordicware steamer. It arrived with a strong plastic smell. Washed it for numerous times but could not get rid of smell. Ended up throwing it in trash since all veggies cooked in there smelled like plastic.
5,"Quick, convenient, and great results","I love steamed vegetables, but the reality was I wasn't eating very many because it took some work to prepare them correctly. With this microwaveable steamer, it's all different. It couldn't be easier: both in cooking and cleaning up at the end. Plus, everything I've cooked has been delicious - especially asparagus and zucchini. This is easily one of the best kitchen purchases I have made."
5,Major Help for Healthful Eating,"If I could keep only 3 cooking vessels, this steamer would make the cut. It's darn near foolproof (the ""fool"" being kitchen-inept me), quick & easy to clean. It makes healthful eating much easier. As with virtually everything microwave, you'll likely need to play around a bit to learn YOUR cooking times.This steamer handles fresh & frozen veggies with equal efficacy. The only fish I've cooked in it is salmon and it works well for that too. I've been using mine about a year, and think it's worth twice the price. In fact, I bought two. That way I can cook my salmon in one, then immediately cook veggies in the other; no washing in between.ONE POSSIBLE DOWNSIDE: It holds small amounts; about two three-inch-wide salmon strips, and enough veggies to satisfy one voracious vegetable lover like me, or two less greedy eaters. Perfect & practical for a single person, as I am. But you might want to think twice if you're cooking for more than two.I highly recommend this steamer."
5,Good buy!,Holiday gift for our son-in-law. He loved it and cokked in it for us while we were visiting them in Portland Oregon.
3,Lodge: Please Improve Your Outsourced Manufacturing,"Lodge has a long history and an impeccable reputation. As a fan of cast iron cooking, purchasing a lid for my 10"" skillet was pretty much a no-brainer. Though the lid fits well, I'm sad to report that I'm experiencing the same issue that so many other reviewers have had with the factory pre-seasoning. Following initial use, rust is coming up from beneath the layers. I will need to scrub this puppy down (no small feat with the little spikes) and re-season it.I would also add that factory pre-seasoning with soybean oil makes using these pans a tough call for the growing number of people with soy sensitivities.It would be great to see Lodge improve their standards with respect to the pre-seasoning and/or make unseasoned pieces available.Not entirely happy with this purchase."
3,good lid but does not fit well except on a dutch oven,"When we received it (along with a round griddle) the lid was not packed/covered in a separate cover/plastic. The lid scratched with the griddle and as a result seasoning/coating from the lid and griddle came away.We had purchased this to cover lodge dutch oven (item: L8DD3 dutch over with casserole lid).This fits the oven as a spare lid.But when you try to use the lid for a casserole, it does fit in an airtight fashion and food in a casserole is not cooked well."
2,National Geographic Star Searcher Telescope,I felt it was very flimsy. Put it together and started to use it and the button to turn the light on and off popped off. Don't feel this is a very sturdy product for a child. Will return.
5,How to figure out your ending,"I personally think this book is marvelous! The reason being is that it shows you how to craft a real beginning and determine the ending without fail.Sure, conflict may be old news, but it is what keeps the reader reading. All those times that you've said ""Man! That characters a --bleep!--"" ""Or aw, I feel sorry for him or her"" was conflict at work my friends! The sooner you realize this the better.This book will show you how you can take a half baked idea and turn it into a real story. It will show you why some ""stories"" aren't stories, and why the ones that are, are.What this book doesn't cover: Plot devices, theme, and ""character"" development.I wish I would have had this book as a kid because I refer to it constantly and could have used the solid foundation this book provides."
5,The best there is,"I have taken his class and read the book...and this is the reason that I am now publishing my first novel in 2005. I always knew I had a good story, but just didn't know how to effectively put it on paper. His formula has helped make my story more urgent, readable, and intense. His formula is by no means brain surgery; it is simple in format and makes a lot of sense once you grasp the basic principles. Thank you for sharing your brilliance with the world."
5,Must Read Book,"Of all the books I have in my ""How to Write"" library, this is my Number One favorite. There are a couple of reviews which mention this is just a rewrite of techniques they have already read, but my answer to that is, ""If you read this book before the others, you'd probably say that about the others."" Listen. This is NOT just a rehash of the ""same old techniques."" The author gives the meat of what we need as a fiction writer in order to move a story forward, in order to build life into the pages, in order to give a flat story substance. He doesn't just mention that you need conflict, he tells you what it is and how to develop conflict.You owe it to yourself to buy this book and READ it for yourself. It will save you a a lot of time in money in the long run because it will cut down the amount of crap you buy in the end. I have the printed soft cover, but will be buying the Kindle version because I'm starting to wear out the paper book. But it. That's all I have to say. ~Darren"
3,Good for Beginners,"I think the book is very nurturing for beginners. It offers emmotional support and good basic information. The exercizes are helpful in stimulating creativity. It is not for more experienced writers who wish guidance to deepen the quality of their writing. I was hoping for more boilerplate formats, paging and dramatic beats for prose as is available for scriptwriting in other books."
3,Kindle version is bad,"I won't discuss the information given in this book, since it's already got plenty of reviews.But the Kindle version is seriously subpar. What I mean by subpar is that it's a freaking SCAN of the physical book. There are errors that are inseparable from scanning such as some ""ct"" transformed into ""d"", an ""I"" becomes a ""1"", some italics and bold formatting go further than what's correct, etc.I still enjoy this version because I like the Kindle and that I like the content, but seriously, editors should absolutely make an effort with the electronic version of their books."
5,"Okay, So I'm Excited!","Better than anything I've ever read before in the endless arena of how-to-write-a-book-books. Generally speaking I don't like to advocate violence, but most of the people who write these types of books should be, if not shot, then at least beaten. But not this guy, at least not in my opinion. Very helpful, and concise and I think I'd even like to go so far as to use the word groundbreaking. Read it for yourself, I'm not kidding. If you want to write, first read this!"
5,Better than The Bible,"If only Immediate Fiction were on the nightstand of every hotel room instead of that other book--there'd be so much better stuff to read in this world.Mr. Cleaver not only walks the reader step by step up and over every possible writing obstacle, he also acts as friend and therapist, helping the reader get past the mind games that hold so many good writers back.One such mind game we often use is telling ourselves ""All the great stories have already been told."" Mr. Cleaver succinctly dispels that notion by pointing out that what matters is our way of telling the story--that's what's unique and new. Immediate Fiction is packed with ways to make ""your way"" better."
4,Exercises,"I bought this book for a refresher course after years of not doing anything with my writing. As a refresher, it was good. The exercises at the end of each chapter are excellent. The writing of the instructions doesn't really help with planning a novel -- or maybe it does as it continues the same instructions for each chapter -- as there seems to be only one idea that continues on through. For writing instructions I rate this a 3 star -- for uniqueness of exercises I rate this a 5 -- that makes a total of 8, divided by 2 equals a total rating of 4."
4,Wall of Voodoo Meets Concrete Blonde,"Surprising that more Wall of Voodoo fans aren't familiar with this album, given some great Marc Moreland guitar work. Not every song on this album is a knockout, but a couple of them, ""Souvenir"" in particular, are really, really powerful, with Moreland doing some fine work on what is probably the most memorable song here. There's definitely a JN spin on this album, but Moreland added a lot of depth to it and it's a shame they didn't do more work together before his untimely death a few years back. It's definitely worth tracking down."
3,Some Good Moments,"Johnette writes masterpieces, but she can also put out some mediocre stuff on ocassion. I count 6 good songs and 7 mediocre songs on this album. It's her standard sound/formula, but many tracks just don't quite make it. It your not a fan, pass this one up. If you are a big fan of Johnette, then I would say yes it is definately worth having in your collection. There are some good songs here."
4,Inspiring book w/great photos & ideas,"For all us wannabe designers, this book is inspiring and educational. The photos really give you an idea of how all aspects of a space work together. I especially liked the author's emphasis on storage solutions, which anyone on any budget can take advantage of (though this book tends to focus on apartments that were designed from scratch). As with most of these books, it's mostly apartments that are analyzed, but the book does include a rowhouse that is decorated in a (shock!) tradition style instead of contemporary, which I found refreshing. Not the kind of book you'll read cover to cover, but one you'll pick up and find something new each time."
5,The Longaberger Consultant and Bentley's Guide,"I am a Longaberger consultant and have every Bentley's Guide ever published, including an autographed first copy. It is a great help in promoting the value of our products (the fact that they appreciate, not depreciate)! It has been of great help in increasing insurance coverage, not only for myself, but also for customers. I had one customer who lost items in a fire; we used the guide for the replacement value for the insurance company. I now have customers who purchase their own Guide."
5,jmic,"This is a must see for fans of Lance Henriksen. Besides the Millennium series this is my favorite. A super sexy psychological thriller. I've watched it over and over. Henriksen gives a mesmerizing performance combining mystery, menace,vulnerabilty, hidden sensitivity and uninhibited primal sensuality. He is a master of complex characters when given the chance. Can't imagine why this was not released to the theaters. Strong cast."
2,"Lance like you've never seen him before, but . . .","Unfortunately, this is a derivative, poorly scripted bit of straight-to-video schlock. Its only value lies in the novelty of seeing Lance Henriksen as a slightly sinister womanizer (with some softcore sex scenes to boot). Pity that Mr. H only gets about 37 minutes of screen time. Co-star Joan Severance has been better in any number of other features, but she has little to work with in this script. The story is predictable (you'll know who the killer is well before anyone in the story figures it out). The characters behave in ways that serve the plot without making sense. The dialogue is terrible--neither smart nor sexy (what you can hear of it between the poor sound editing and the lousy music). This film will only interest serious fans of Lance Henriksen or Joan Severance. If you're looking for a smartly done, sexy mystery/thriller . . . keep looking."
5,Introduction to the Old Testament,"This book is a standard Old Testament introduction used in many seminaries. It comes from a moderate conservative theological perspective. It provides excellent detail on current Old Testament scholarship, as well as providing excellent introductions to each of the books of the Old Testament. It is amply illustrated with B/W photos and drawings. It has very useful indexes and bibliographies."
3,NOT ALL THE TRACKS ARE AT THEIR FULL VERSIONS,"I'm thinking if I buy this CD or not, but first I'd like to know the tracks SANGRE (Underground Mix) and Love (1001 Nights Club Mix) are full versions. Can anyone tell me, please? I'd be thankful."
5,"Lively, Upbeat, Wonderfully Rythmic Latin Pop.","If your New to Latin Pop this is a great Album to get you started, If your already a fan, you get alot of Thalia's best all in one album. Thalia is a creative girl and experiments with different sounds on other albums, but this album showcases her at her very best. Amazon has given us some very good examples of Thalia's range. Doing Lively, Upbeat, wonderfully Rythmic Latin Pop like:1. Amarillo Azul 2. Pacto Entre los DosAnd softer more beautifal songs like.3. Pienso en Ti 4. Mundo de CristalThat are just a pleasure to listen too soaking up one of the loveliest female voices in music. Click on the samples, listen for yourself."
3,Good Beginning to the study of Business Intelligence,"Rustmann's book is an attempt to cover the world of intelligence in business. There are numerous books out there about competitive intelligence and a few about economic or corporate espionage, but none that really do the subject justice. This book does a good job of starting to look at the subject and is recommended as an introduction. Unfortunately, the definitive work in this area has yet to be written for the public.I found this book lagged in parts and digressed into the inevitable war stories that intelligence practitioners find so interesting. I did not find they added much to the book."
5,How did I live without these?,"These are a great addition to any kitchen. Designed for fajitas, they have many other uses. I grill steaks in my Lodge Logic grill pan and have these heating in the oven. There is nothing worse than having an expensive steak go cold - and these pans prevent that. A wonderful gift - very attractive as well as functional - and a must have for steak and fajita lovers."
2,"For fajitas, try the 8"" skillet instead","I considered buying this skillet for many weeks until I discovered the Lodge Logic 8"" skillet is better suited as a personal pan for fajitas. Sure, this pan with its handle cover and wood base is a nice novelty, but not practical for serving fajitas. First of all, you can't actually cook the onions and peppers on this skillet without them falling off the side. But the 8"" pan is great for frying up the onions and peppers and seasonings. You can then throw in the chicken from the barbecue grill when it's ready and serve the personal 8"" pan to your guests. NOTE: the pan will need some kind of heat proof mat or wood to set on. We use little bamboo cutting boards. I guess you could fry up all the ingredients in a large pan and then serve them on the pre-heated fajita set, but who has the space and time to go to all this trouble? Besides, the 8"" skillet can hold more of everything."
3,"Nice, but I don't use it often.","I think the product is nice, but I use it very rarely. Mainly because the pan has very specific use."
5,Great product,"I used to work at Chili's in Cali, we used the Fajita pans there all the time. I was looking for something just like it in weight and strength. I haven't used the product yet but I can tell it's heavy duty and it's exactly what I was searching for. The price was right too. I can't wait to make fajitas like I did when I worked at Chili's, sizzling hot and flavorful:)"
5,This is the one,"Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Fajita SetHave tried several others similar to these and that's the 'key word'... ""similar"". The others are definitely only similar (in looks on-line) but, these are worth the money. Made in the U.S. of A.. Great size for either fajitas or steaks and a very nice, sturdy wooden base that is properly finished. Not beat-up and worn looking like the others I've tried and immediately returned. I am very pleased with this find and would not hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for this sort of serving plate. Exceptional value that includes 'free shipping'. I'm not easily impressed but, this is a very nice product."
5,Excellent,"Good quality and fun to use. Makes us feel like we're dining in a restaurant! Heavy metal, not flimsy. Great deal."
1,Lacking objective analysis...Did he get paid for writing this???,"Brode tries to argue in his book that Disney and the company are very liberal and socialist. He writes that Disney actually favored socialism over captialism, and that Disney created movies to entertain the masses. He also statees that the Disney company was the catalyst for the student protests of the sixties. The book reads as if he was instructed by a PR person from Disney; he leaves out every criticism ever published. According to him, there are not racial or gender issues promoted in the animated films. His arguments, however, seem lame and sometimes far-fetched. This cannot be seen as a trustworthy, academic secondary source about Disney and the company!"
4,Best Oil album out of a large catalog,"This is an incredible album from a very talented band known in the U.S. for their one hit ""Beds Are Burning"". If you are a fan of just that one song this album may not be for you. It does include a little pop sensiblity in the way of ""When The Generals Talk"" and ""Who Can Stand In The Way"", but most of the albums has strange indigineous Australian instruments as well as some great orchestration. Songs like ""Bells..."" and ""Shipyards Of New Zealand"" have constant time changes and varieties of music styles within the songs themselves. It is not a perfect album with small flaws such as the strange instrumental ""Bakerman"" which does however fit into the flow of this weird album. Overall, it is possibly the best Midnight Oil album out there and that's saying a lot about a band that has such a large and impressive catalog."
4,"different from 10,9,8 and Diesel And Dust...","I got this CD for two tracks from 20,000 Watt R.S.L.: ""Best Of Both Worlds"" and ""Kosciuszko"". The rest of the songs is, for the most part, really good! Here on this CD, the Oils experiment a little bit with dance and disco (""When The Generals Talk"", ""Jimmy Sharman's Boxers"") as well as a little country (a hoedown to be exact, complete with a dijeridu: ""Helps Me Helps You""). And then there's a brass ensemble instrumental (""Bakerman"") and a piece that probably belongs in a cabaret (""Bells And Horns In The Back Of Beyond"")! In conclusion, ""Red Sails"" is somewhat of a very diverse album, an album which is vastly underappreciated compared to ""10,9,8"" and ""Diesel And Dust"". In fact, I think this CD is better than the aforementioned in some respects. If you're a true Oils fan and haven't gotten this one yet, get it now!"
2,Way to spacy and weird for me,"As a long time fan of Midnight Oil, this CD is very surprising to me. 'Red Sail in the Sunset' is a release that is so un- Midnight Oilish. There is no method to the songs and in no order so the CD sounds spacy and weird. Makes me wonder what Peter Garrett and members were doing whilst recording this CD. Only one song stands out in this release and that is 'Kosciusko'. The rest of the songs are forgettable and I know this CD will be the least played album in my home."
4,Great,"On the heels of 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1, this one is quite a bit different but nonetheless a classic. Variety adds spice to life and on this release the Oils expand thier sound a bit more. The slow burn of ""Jimmy Sharman's Boxers"" is brillant as well as the energy found in ""Best of Both Worlds"" and ""Kosciousko"". A bit darker and brooding than its predecessor, it is nonetheless brilliant, melodic, powerful, and moving. A must have."
4,From Good to Great?,"The songs on this album are memorable and powerful. It's hard not to appreciate the sheer originality of Fleck's work.However, the sparkle and energy of the earlier ""electric"" works are not evident here, and I miss them too much. While he is a virtuoso player, he cannot sustain as much interest as what I came to like so much in the amplified and synthsized works.The album is very listenable, and I do prefer it for background music when working, etc. But it cannot sustain my interest."
3,"good album , but ""drive"" is better","this is good, but spacey. His ""drive"" album is amazing. If you don't have ""drive"" i'd get that first."
3,Deceiving,"I love most of Bela's music. I'm more of a bluegrasser though, and was fooled by the ""Acoustic Planet"" title. There are electronic drum-pads being played in each song, which gives a hollow sound, despite some nice beats. The musicianship is great, but the songs lack drive. Each song seems to be drifting in limbo, with no direction and no focus.If you want what this CD seems to be, get ""The Bluegrass Sessions."" Then, get ""Drive."" Sweetness!"
4,Mostly ok,"Got these orange stick because it was a very good deal. Some of them don't have the slanted edge, but still usable. Overall, it is a good deal compared to local shops where I get only five sticks for 2 dollars."
4,feedback,great tool to frost a cake in seconds with a lot less mess and time. A definite for all cake decorators and can be used for piping potatoes
2,Disappointed,"This is the first time I've received something that I was not happy with. The top does not screw on properly and the blades are too close to the bottom of the glass to put any amount of food in the jar. I guess for how inexpensive this was, I got what I paid for."
2,Enchanted I was not!,"This is the first Teresa Medeiros book I've ever purchased and read. I have to say that her heroine was not a very endearing character. Okay, so she's not very talented when it comes to using her gift, but she had the amulet left to her by her mother, couldn't she make good use of it? Also, I find it hard to believe that she almost willingly gave this amulet to Sir Colin for ""safe keeping""! Come on! Where's the common sense? And why did she not think of wishing her attire to fit the time period she was in? Why continue wearing your 20th century pajamas? I'm sorry to say, I know I love fiction romance novels, but I don't like books that seem to have been written wishy-washy. Save your money and buy an Elizabeth Lowell or a Lynn Kurland books."
3,Touch of Enchantment,"DISAPPOINTING! :(After reading Breath of Magic, I was on tenterhooks waiting 2 know what happened 2 Arian & Tristan after they got lost in the Bermuda Triangle. I was totally disappointed 2 know that they were missing 4 such a trivial reason. Anyway, while I might've liked Tabitha better if I hadn't read the 1st book but after knowing Arian, her daughter didn't seem that interesting.& I missed Sven(& his un-cat-friendly ways), who didn't even make an appearance till the end & a brief 1 at that.Sir Arjon just didn't measure up.There were some funny scenes, & Colin is a great hero but he's not as memorable as Tristan. I would have loved 2 see Tristan go back in time again(without all the modern stuff he's used 2 + food loaded with all that fat & cholesterol).p/s:The ending for Roger (the bad guy) was a tad too ridiculous.To Maria from N.Y.,please don't give up on Teresa Medeiros.Read Breath of Magic & you will see why Ms. Medeiros is 1 of my FAVORITE authors."
4,not as good as breath of magic,"This was a good book, but I felt somehow less enchanted than I had in Breath of Magic, or Heather and Velvet. It was good and all, but I couldn't quite identify with the heroine. She seemed determined to thwart her common sense. When she did things rationally this was a really good book. And, even if you did not like this one, you should read another, because most of Teresa's Books are very good"
3,For a Ph.d. the heroine comes across as stupid,"I love Teresa Medeiros and I love the premise of this book, but the heroine was just stupid. She has realized that she may have time traveled to the year 1254 and she just continues to talk as if she is in the 21th century. Even I don't talk as stupid as that and I do live in the 21th century. She is supposed to be a witch, but she can't bring herself to her own time and she can't help the people that have taken her in. The story would have been better if the heroine had stopped using the modern day language and had shown some intelligence. The hero came across as well as a knight in shining amor. Over all I liked the story but it just wasn't that great."
3,"Nice, yet disturbing","This book was cool. Yet colin the ""Hero"" is just wacko. some parts your like he is so hot other parts your like ewh creep. this book was very interesting in how she relates the future with the past, yet you wished she would have done it more. I do recommend this book, yet when I think about it the male was very disturbing. The main thing is to read this book, even if some of the logic is twisted."
2,Not as good as was expected from the reviews read.,"In romance novels, why is the heroine always so empty-headed? The hero is strong, brave, sensible, tender, caring - someone you would want to step out of the pages of the book into your life. The heroine, however, is more often than not irritating in her stupidity, alternating between being a empty-headed woman and a preschool child. If you are comparing this book with other romances, it was okay. It had some promise, but Tabitha still fell into the empty-headed female category. If you are comparing this book with another time travel novel written - Outlander by Diana Gabaldon, it really wasn't worth the money paid or the time invested in reading it. Diana Gabaldon is the only author I have come across who can portray an intelligent heroine to match her fantastic hero. From the reviews of Touch of Enchantment and the author, I was ready to go out and buy all of her books and settle back for some enjoyable reading. I'm glad now I only bought the one"
5,Medeiros' magical words make a lovely and charming romance.,"A Touch of Enchantment was my first dalliance with Teresa Medeiros and what a dalliance it was! This romance is the stuff of legends- adventure, magic, laughter, community, shattering barriers, hot sex, pure and triumphant love. I have only high praise for an author who can make me cry and laugh and love her characters. A Touch of Enchantment sold me on Medeiros and I have read several of her other novels since reading this one, but none have been as grand and lovely and charming as this one."
3,An interesting enough plot,"This is my first Teresa Medeiros book, its interesting but a little too far-fetched for my tastes. The main character of Tabitha did not seem to have much depth. Almost everything was pretty superficial. I sure hope her other books are not like this one. It is a nice sweet story nonetheless. Just probably not a 'keeper' - to re-read over again."
1,Extremely Poor Quality,"I have bought many other Melissa & Doug products and have been relatively happy with them. This one, though, is a huge disappointment. I had put the puzzle away for a few weeks after receiving it so that I could take it out on a ""rainy day."" When I opened the product, I found the lamination defective. All of the pieces stuck together and the paper for the picture tore when I tried to separate the pieces. I wanted to return the puzzle or at least exchange it for a new one but apparently I would only get a partial refund and no shipping credit. As a result, I threw it away and won't be buying anymore Melissa & Doug puzzles."
2,poorly laminated,"We have many Melissa and Doug puzzles. Lately, though, I've been getting the more ""complicated"" puzzles for our autistic child, and the picture peels off the plywood BEFORE she begins to play. In several of the earlier purchases, I'd thought it was our fault. Not this time. The paper tore as I separated the pieces. Is the quality dropping in the Melissa and Doug line, or is it that the more pieces there are in the puzzle, the more poorly the laminate adheres? Either way, I am disappointed, and will be returning this item. Poor hippo. He lost his mouth and grassy snacks.Judy Jacobs, Summerville, SC"
1,unacceptable,"If I could give it a minus star review, I would. This puzzle was supposed to be a nice wooden toy. It was very thin wood and not cut all the way through so it wasn't a puzzle at all. I bought two of this brand and both were terrible. I will never buy this brand of anything again. Big rip off!! Gave as gifts or I would return them myself."
4,Great Puzzle,My 3 year old loves this puzzle. The pieces are very durable and the colors are bright and fun. The pieces are a bit hard to take apart but all in all it is a great product.
2,"Great idea, not so great in quality","We have purchased many puzzles and toys from Melissa and Doug, but the last couple of things have just been poorly made. This jigsaw puzzle was not completely cut apart. When we tried to pry the pieces apart, they just splintered everywhere. We had to throw it away without ever using it. Again, we have purchased multiple items before with no issues, but are now cautious of doing so again."
5,Great puzzle,"We bought this puzzle for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and she loves it. It's very durable and high quality. Our only qualm is that it is rather large. We like to take puzzles with us when we travel to keep our daughter entertained, but it's a little too big. However, at home it's a big hit!"
1,"It was great, until the board split","I got this for my 2-yr-old, and we've had problems with it. First, there is no guide picture on the front to show kids how the puzzle should look assembled. There is a small sticker on the back of the large puzzle board, but we use that as a flat surface to put the puzzle together, so we aren't flipping the board back and forth to see the picture. She finally learned to put pieces together based on similar colors and patterns, but then the base board that the pieces sit in split, the glue from the veneers coming apart. I now have a few pieces of warped wood that were supposed to house the puzzle.I've had lots of Melissa and Doug items, and this is my first disappointment. Not only is it difficult to play with, it didn't last very long before coming apart."
3,Products made in china have poor quality,"The picture is poorly glued onto the puzzle and as a result it started peeling off after only one use. The cutting between pieces was poorly done too and it is too difficult for my daughter to pull the pieces out and put them back in because they get stuck so easily. Seriously, how hard is it to manufacture a wooden puzzle?!Admittedly, I've never had this much trouble with other Melissa and Doug products that were made in China, so maybe I shouldn't be so cynical."
3,Shoddy Construction,"This puzzle, and the Ocean puzzle from Melissa and Doug are paper on pressed wood. They are ok, but my little distructo managed to pull the paper off of one piece. Other pieces are splintering in the back. On the plus side, she loves the puzzle and puts it together over and over."
3,wood piece brake easy,the wood has broken around the puzzle and some of the puzzle have brooken and the picture is coming off them as well
3,Beautiful but not durable,"We bought this puzzle as a Christmas present for our two year old. The problem with this puzzle was evident as soon as we got it out of the package. While the back of the puzzle is wooden (like other M&D puzzles), the picture was printed on paper and adhered to the wood before the pieces were cut. When we disassembled the puzzle for the first time, we didn't notice that the puzzle pieces didn't get gut all the way through the paper, so when we separated the pieces the paper got torn, taking some of the design with it. We were very disappointed, especially considering the quality of product we've grown accustomed to receiving when purchasing M&D products. Our son still likes it and plays with it fairly often."
5,Andrew's favorite puzzle,My son Andrew got this puzzle for his birthday. He loves this puzzle so much. He takes it apart and puts it together over and over. These kind of puzzles are great for his age. It helps him with his motor skills.
2,My son got a splinter,"We have plenty of M & D products including puzzles. This one, however, seemed to be made cheaply. The puzzle splintered and pieces of it pulled apart from the backing within minutes of receiving it. The puzzle is cute, but it is not made well."
1,Storage is a problem,"No good way to store it after kids are done playing. Also, no picture visible while mkaing the puzzle on the board.. how is anyone supposed to make it on the board, if no picture is provided. Sloppy work by Melissa and Doug...suprisingly.Quality is good."
5,excellent puzzle,"Very good design, with hard board underneath. Excellent boy for 2-3 year old kids. My son loves it!"
3,Pricey & Flimsy Puzzle,"I was disappointed in this puzzle. It didn't seem to be up to Melissa & Doug's usual high standards. The puzzle pieces were flimsier than I thought they would be, hard to separate and hard to push down into place. However, the artwork is beautiful and I think my 3 yr old will enjoy it in the near future."
5,A classic,"By today's standards, it's nothing wonderful, but for it's time period this was an excellent album.In an era where this music was so underground that nobody even heard of techno or raves, pumping songs like track 2 with the preacher saying ""Rock and Roll is the Devil's Music"" here in rock dominated USA made for some really good laughs. This album is mostly ""instrumental"" with an occasional sampled phrase. This was Hardcore before they figured out they could push the tempos by using breakbeats. Much of the heaviness is from the well distored synths etc.Track List01-Air Of Gloom - Meditation02-Oliver Adams - I'm On Fire03-Trance Trax - Pwm-Wave04-Angel Ice - Paranoid05-Lords Of Acid - Let's Get High06-The Spell - Get out Of My House07-Dlm -I.S.N.I.X.

3,FALSE ADVERTISING,"This product is listed as Lodge Logic. It is not. It's just Lodge. Lodge Logic is the pre-seasoned product line. As one other customer mentioned, these pans are not pre-seasoned. I wish I'd read before I bought. Even worse, Amazon doesn't list telephone numbers and their e-mail help is outsourced. Buy it if you don't mind not getting what you ordered. Lodge is great stuff, but Amazon is not."
4,GOOD DVD,GOOD DVD. HOPE TO FIND T.G. SHEPARDS VIDEO HITS ON DVD SOME DAY. THANKS FOR HAVING IT. WILLIAM
5,A terrific book to reconcile men and feminism,"The book is must reading for anyone who is a male-basher, or a male chauvinist pig. It will be a catalyst in the truce between men and women. It shows how the feminist movement can be pro-male and that women have to accept equal rights and responsibilities. Her tone is cheerful, incisive, and there is no hostility towards either men or women. My favorite chapter is ""Damned if they do, damned if they don't""."
5,Keeps the coffee flowing,"I was so happy to be able to order this part when my coffee maker broke. It was literally a ""snap"" to replace the old one as the new one was identical. For a couple of bucks I was able to put my fairly expensive coffee maker back in service."
4,Fixed and cheap,This did exactly what it was supposed to. The coffe pot is working again. I will buy it again at the price to keep the old pot working.
4,I've been using these products for years,"I've been using these products for years, I would recommend them to anyone looking to get into canning. Very dependable product for the price. If the magnet were just a tad stronger I would bump it up to a 5 star rating but considering you really can't find a less expensive model, it'll do :-)"
4,Norpro 606 Magnetic Lid wand,I was excited to get the wand. I have been doing some canning and this is definitely a great item to keep hands out of hot water.
5,a must have,"Anyone that cans needs this tool. I can reach into the scalding water with this wand and pick up a lid, then place it on the can. Wow, no burns. It is a lot better than trying to fish out a lid with a fork (my old way). It helps to keep everything sterile while canning."
1,Expected a little more,"I just recieved this in the mail and I'm a little disappointed. Looks like something you would pick up at the dollar store. Only 6 3/4 inches long so not made for big pots, maybe just smaller ones. Looks to be made out of cheap plastic. Not at all pleased. Was going to give this for a gift but now I have to find something else to do with it. I cant give this to anyone as a gift! I would not recommend this one to anyone."
1,enormous crack after one use,"I would assume such a thick cast iron pot should not break like mine did, see photo's above. I attempted to return to amazon but the window has expired so even though it's clearly a defective product, I'm stuck. I hear they usually have a good product, I'd just be careful where you purchase it since clearly mine was defective and amazon won't take it back."
5,"Great, great, great!","What else can I say. If you take care of it, this dutch oven will last generations. The iron is smooth (no sharp, bumpy finish like cheaper ovens). Plus it's made in the USA! Perfect for camping. The legs on the botton and lip on the lid allow you to place charcoals under and over for outdoor cooking. Anything you can cook in the oven at home can be cooked in a dutch oven. Pot Roast, lasagna, corn bread, cakes, cobblers, chili. We also use it for frying and browning (bacon, ground meat, etc. The lid is reversible and can act as a small skillet as well. Note that this is the deep version of the 12"" oven. We also have a 6 quart (shallow) version. I would recommend this one, as you have more room to play with. I sue this one for the main course, and the shallow 6-quart for desert and bread. I have a 10"" that I use for keeping things warm."
1,It is cracked,"I have ordered the 8-quart camp dutch oven and received it in Mongolia. I was roasting a lamb leg in it and after about 1 hour over a coal fire it is cracked and all juice split into the fire. I tried to weld it, but did not work. I just wasted 56$."
5,Lodge pot,Have not used it yet but it seems to be of great quality and had a timely arrival! The istructions are thorough and the accompaning recipies sound complete and delicious. Looks to be lots of fun.
5,American Iron Baby!,I've had these in use for a year now. I have the 8 quart deep and the 6 quart for camping.These are fantastic for cooking at the campfire. I found they were the perfect thing for keeping the kids entertained at dusk in camp. Just fill them with pinapple upside down cake.They take good even heat and I had no hot spot issues. I like that Lodge puts the oil treatment on the iron ware right from the factory. Gives a good base immediately.Last year these were much cheaper than they are now. I'm glad I bought them when I did. I don't think I'd pay the current price but I do love the products.
5,Outstanding!,"I have cooked 3 things with this Dutch Oven, using the included cookbook. Completely successful in every way! I told my old hunting buddy,if I would have known about this Dutch oven years ago, I would have never left camp!! Lots of fun and great eating that even gets my wife's seal of approvial. And folks, that ain't easy!"
1,Broke on the Bottom,"I can't believe that this item showed up broke. It was obvious the packaging had been compensated for with all the old tape that was on the box. Not only was it broke, but it had rust on the lid. I was truly unhappy!"
2,"Heavy, but poor quality control","It just arrived several days ago. It's heavy and most of it is well-made. However, it came out of the box with some missing coating areas - not due to shipping, but poor quality control - like they missed coating some areas of the raw metal. I would have preferred to have bought it in the store where I can see the quality versus getting what they send you. Not worth shipping back. Will only use for emergencies since I'm not sure how the metal will effect the food."
2,It's OK but....,"This is the second dutch oven that I have had. It works fine but the pre-seasoned cast iron is really an exaggeration. I have used other older cast iron such as Griswold and they are really seasoned. This is not and I don't know how one of their non-seasoned cast iron pieces would work, but it can't stick any more than this. In order to get it clean it must be scrubbed and whatever seasoning it had is removed. I guess I will have to season it my self although I have tried cleaning without soap and adding oil to it afterwards and it hasn't improved. If you really want a good cast iron piece of cookware, find an old one and invest the money in that."
5,"Lodge Logic, still the best out there","This was the value of the year. I needed an oven for girl scout camp and home use, one with legs to better fit the coals underneath. I have been cooking in this oven ever since I received it. The Lodge Logic brand is the best out there, or so I'm told, and I can believe it. The accompanying booklet had care instructions and recipes that were very easy to understand."
4,"It's worth the money, i guess.","I give props to Eminem for making an album with 20 quality tracks. Most artists nowadays make records with like 10-14 songs, and only 4 of them are any good. Eminem's cd has 20 tracks, and there are about 10 quality songs on it, such as ""toy soldiers"",""mosh"",""mockingbird"",and ""yellow brick road""."
1,poor,There is one obsessed fan that has posted over 200 5 star reviews for this lame cd because he wants to keep the rating up. I feel sorry for this geek. The cd stinks as does this guy's English so he's either someone who knows very little English (as he says the same stupid things each times) or he's just an idiot...my guess is BOTH. This CD ranks barely a 2 without this moron's obssessions.
3,Good Guy,When i listen to slim shady i thought eminem was gross.until i heard this album and i found out hes a pretty cool guy.
2,Never was a Big fan thought this was ok..,"Emeinem hasn't came out with anything in a while. I thought this cd was ok.I thought was way to overplayed and generic. My sister and me won a drawing at best buy and I bought this cd with the gift card. I listened to it and thought it was kind of boring. I never thought Emeinem was that good to me. He just seemed really trashy, and his hooks were weak.Compared to alot of other black rappers. I do think he's came out with better stuff now. Toy soldier was pretty good. I really like his cover of Martika's Song, and it is my 2nd favorite Emeinem song. I thought it was daring bold and different. The children singing gave me chills,and the video has a great message."
2,Terrible Album,"Both the dirty and clean versions are terrible. The singles on this album are more edited than the TV versions. In the ""Mosh"" video, they only censor the F word. On the album version, they censor words such as ""strapped with an AK-47"" or ""ass-crack"", and more, and are both played uncensored on MTV and BET. Also on Toy Soldiers, they censor ""killed"" and ""murdered"" and allow it in the video. It is the worst Eminem album ever released and should have the same edited versions as the ones on TV"
3,Not a great followup,"I was very disappointed by this CD. I so much enjoyed its predecessor that I had high hopes for this one. Hopes that were soundly dashed. There are few memorable tracks on this one, and it really sounds a lot like just more of the same. He has wicked talent. Don't know what happened to it this time though."
1,Put down the bong and get out the needle.........,you're going to want to end it all after hearing this drivel. Once this band had a couple brain cells. Now all we're left with is the smelly carcass.Yuck!
4,Cute costume,"Outfit runs a little small. Ordered a large for child between 8 and 10. It is a little big but not much. Collar is reinforced to stand up and it has a thin underskirt to help support the skirt. It has to be steamed because it gets very wrinkled in the package. The hat needs to be pinned on and would be easier if it had an elastic strap. Overall, it is cute."
4,Great costume,"I bought this costume for my 6 year old daughter. We are going to a 50th wedding anniversary party and the theme is the 50's. She normally wears a 6x, I got this in medium, thinking it may be too big, but I didn't want to get the small and it be to small and have her only able to wear it once. But I was very please with the way the medium fits, it is only just a little too big, but not so big it looks bad. She loves to play dress up, so she should be able to wear it for a couple years. And the plan is for it to be her Halloween costume as well. So I think this was a great purchase for our intended uses. It is very cute. It looks just like the picture, except for the hat, It is a little flat and doesn't have a chin strap or anything to hold it on. so I'm gonna try to attach some elastic but I'm afraid it's not gonna stand up quite right. Maybe if a put a lot of starch on it. Glad I made this purchase. It was cheaper on Amazon, than any other site. Well worth the price."
5,Cute!,It arrived just in time for halloween. My daughter loved it ! I was true to size and the quality was as expected.
5,Great costume!,"Way cuter than I thought it would be! My 6 year old and I got onto Amazon to pick out her Halloween costume for this year when we came across this one and she immediately fell in love! She is really small for her age, so despite the reviews, I still ordered the small. Although it fit enough to still look cute, I definitely would get the size bigger if I could do it all over again. Also, I had to add elastic to the hat to make it stay (like a birthday hat), but that was a simple fix. Either way, everyone loved it!!"
3,To small :(,"Really cute but the sizes run way small. :( my daughter is a small 9 year old, but I think that she will need a large."
2,Too small,"The sizing was weird to me. I ordered a medium size 8-10, thinking it would fit my average size child. But NO the size was way off size 8-10 fits ages 6-7? They should have had that bigger and then I would have ordered a bigger size. Other then that the costume was very cute. Would recommend but check sizing first."
4,Happy this Halloween,"we could not find the size we needed in the local stores, so tried this way. All worked out well. the purchase arrived promptly and the costume was exactly what we expected. 4 stars as the price was more than the stores by about 20%.Thanks for making this a ""Happy Halloween"" for my daughter""Happy""in Phoenix, AZ"
5,5 but I'm prejudiced,"This is not really a review but an attempt to correct the display of this CD, which lacks the titles and performers and movements of the compositions.

2,Blood River by Jorey Sherman,"Boring. If I would have bought this book at my local book store, I would have returned it and ask for my money back."

1,is this good birdseed pri pri??? i dont think so littel bird!,"i gave this food to a bird and he did not like it! maybe it tastes bad? we will never know cause birds cant talk! but this bird would say ""this seed was not good!"""
2,Dissapointed.,"True, the book contains many pearls of wisdom, but I was turned off by occasional hints of self-congratulations, and other mildly gauche aspects of the book.**Other unexpected aspects of the book are the frequent digressions to more general advice about how to live one's life, and the underlying Christian theme of the book.I sent it back, as I was looking for more of an etiquette-oriented book on building personal relationships.**Statements that the author ""is one of America's most influential and successful business leaders,"" are balderdash. This construction company owner is an unknown in the scope of the national business scene."
5,Great album,This is a great album. I enjoy all the tracks and listen to the album often. Too bad the artists didn't have any follow up albums (that I know of).
4,Great outdoor cooking,Great Dutch Oven. I would suggest that you spend a couple of dollars more and buy the one that is already seasoned. It is not that difficult to do on your own but receiving it already done and cooked in their ovens it sure to be done exactly right.Another suggestion for the new folks starting out with dutch oven cooking which was helpful to us is to line the pot with one big piece of aluminum foil when you cook something containing sugar. This will save you when it comes to cleanup. I also know some folks that use it most of the time for all kinds of cooking.Enjoy!
4,Great for baked treats in a campground!,"We had our first dutch oven experience on a rafting trip in Utah - chocolate cake! We had to have one to have baked treats in a campground. We had excellent results with cakes, cornbreads and enchiladas...I have not yet perfected the cinnamon rolls - they burn a bit on the bottom - but will happily keep trying. A great hint is to soak 2 paper towels with PAM to line the bottom when baking...makes clean-up a breeze! One big drawback is the weight of this thing...I believe it weighs 26 pounds and will not go in a backpack!"
5,great,This was a great buy. The dutch oven arrived safely and quickly. The shipping was free and we had a $15 off coupon. The whole thing would have had to be free to be better!
5,8 quart dutch over,"The first one that arrived had a flaw, but the 2nd one is in perfect shape. It is exactly what I expected. It is very fun to use."
1,crap,"ok. 1. to raven. SHe is an angle? Like in math? uhh.. i'm assuming you mean angel.and 2. please spell racist right. r-a-c-i-s-t. Yeh, people invented spell check for a reason.3. Bratz give bad ideas and false values to young innocent girls. I mean, look at what she's wearing. Little kids are going to think in order to be ""cool"" and ""popular"" like these dolls they idolize they have to wear pratically nothing and act like a slutand finally 4. have you noticed how abnormally big their heads and shoes are?"
4,One Of My Favorites!,"So far, I like this Sasha than most of the other Sasha's out there. I've never seen her in stores, and already the internet pictures have me in love. I love her chocolate-cream-colored skin, lightish-pink lips (With a dark pink outline.) and her shimmery brown hair. I despise the fakey-fake fur coat and the way her pants are cut at the bottom, can we say hippie? Plus, glittery halter tops and hippie-pants don't match. Otherwise, I love the second outfit and the doll itself. :DL0V3, 3L|$$@."
1,Shut-up Meggie D!,"HELLO!!! Chelsea Churro is right about this doll! She only gave it a 3, is that so horrible! No, so shut-up and you an go find out what a psycho is. This doll does need a little more clothes and more colors."
5,SORRY!,"Meggie D. I am so sorry for hating you. I shouldn't of judged you. This is Chelsea Churro and I too like BOTH My Scene and Bratz. My fave Bratz are Fianna, Jade, and Phoebe and my fave My Scene are Chelsea, Nolee, and Kenzie. I like this doll and now I agree that she is F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S. Meggie D. please add more to your about you area, write back, and visit mine soon. Please get these dolls. They are fabulous. Well worth the price. Oh and you who pretended to be Meggie D. I hate your guts and I know your tone!"
4,A VERY PRETTY SASHA DOLL,I REALLY LIKE THIS DOLL. I THINK SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL IN THE OFF-WHITE CLOTHING. HER HAIR IS ELEGANT AND HER MAKE-UP IS GREAT. I EVEN LIKE HER BLACK SHADES. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE THIS DOLL. SASHA DOLLS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS VERY BEAUTIFUL. 4.5 STARS.
1,My Scene is better!,This Bratz doll proves that My Scene is better because she looks ugly. Fabulous? As if! Here's what she should have to be fabulous:1.GREAT COLORS2.DECENT OUTFITS3.Fashion SensePlease don't waste your money on this doll or any of the other fabulouses!
4,Brazilian Guitar,"The examples in this book are great, and I think this is probably the one book to have if one is interested in latin style comping. The complaint I have is that the CD is recorded terribly, distortion abounds and the sound quality is low. Otherwise a great addition to the collection."
3,Wish they would publish this book again,"Unfortunately this doesn't come with the audio tracks which are pretty much essential. Really wish they'd reprint this book as it's really the only Brazilian guitar book ever put out. You can find the audio on line if you look around, but it's a pain in the A to practice and not have an actual book."
5,Daily Inspiration,Bought these for myself and liked them so much I bought a second set for my niece who received them while in the hospital after cancer surgery. She found them encouraging in her stress situation.
1,"Gritty Surface, Uneven heat","I SO wanted to love this pan. But alas, it infuriates me every time I use it. The gritty surface that has not gone away, in spite of use and seasoning, makes eggs, pancakes, etc stick terribly. When used for things like grilled cheese, the center portion over the flame heats WAY hotter than the edges of the pan and the sandwiches brown completely uneven. I hate it. Glad it was cheap so I'm not out that much money. Should have returned it. Too late."
1,the worst pan,"I wanted a new cast iron pan, it said it was already seasoned....i used it, everything stuck....tried to clean it, very difficult. when then i seasoned it again...same thing. everything sticks...not what i expected."
3,not good this time..,I have purchased this product twice. Once it was perfect. Next time it was absolutely flop. I dont know what went wrong.
5,if you like fried eggs and pancakes country stile this is it.,"personally i like cooking with cast iron. i love this griddle. it took about 2 mornings of fried eggs before the eggs didn't stick but after that, a little oil or butter and you've got the best fried eggs you could ask for. watch out for the hot handle, keep a hot pad or mit handy."
4,Cast Iron for $15????,"I priced these at my local box retailer and they were $23........ I used them to make country breakfast gift baskets for xmas gifts and at $15 a piece I was able to make a lot more gift baskets than I needed. I really like the Lodge line of products and though I was pretty skeptical of $15 cast iron, I was really pleased with the results. they cook up just like moms old set form the 50's!"
2,needs too much oil,everything we tried on it seemed to stick. Maybe it needs much more oil than what I am comfortable putting in while cooking an omlette.
5,I love cast iron!,"I love cast iron cookwear, and Lodge is the best of the best. American made, preseasoned, even heat; what's not to love! This piece is great for tortillas, grilled cheese, quesidillas, pancakes, burgers, etc... Just use your imagination. Plus, I'll be able to give it to my grandkids some day, and I'm only 27! Spend the little extra money and get the Lodge brand cookwear. It's good for America, plus it really is a better piece. Amazon shipping is always fast and the price was right."
4,Pretty decent,"Works pretty good-needs more seasoning. Definately not the smooth surface of an old Wagner, or Griswald. I just use a little extra oil when cooking, and haven`t had a problem of sticking. I think it will improve with time. Decent product for the price."
4,Very good product,"I have been using this for about 5 months now and am very pleased with it. It was sticky for the first couple of uses and now it has become quite non-sticky. I typically use a nylon brush to clean it after use with an occasional use of mild detergent. Although it retains the heat, the edges are not as hot as the center. To overcome this problem, I sometimes move the skillet around over the heating coil. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend it."
2,griddle review,I bought this product to make dosa an Indian crepe this was supposed to be a substitute for my non stick crepe pan which was too old and peeling so Ihad to throw it away. I thought that the preseasoned pan would help me make my crepes easily. They stuck to the griddle and had to be scraped off. Disappointing
5,MUST HAVE PIECE!!,"I already had two 12 inch lodge skillets and one 9 inch before buying this one. and within 2 days, this has become my favorite piece. And for some reason, it only took one seasoning session and the egg seasoning test passed with flying colors.And if you do love pancakes get this griddle!"
3,Wash and left to dry is a BIG MISTAKE. Rust Rust Rust I hate it.,"Okay, maybe I am fussy, but I won't use a new item without washing it first. I have never owned an iron skillet before. After washing, I placed on my creme colored drying mat. It left a rust spot where it laid and I realized I had made a mistake. I oiled the pan inside and out trying to get rid of the rust. I kept trying to remove the rust with paper towels. As much as I tried, it still has rust and I will not use it. I know I goofed, but it had been a long time since I read the ad and I forgot it needed drying and oiling immediately after cleaning. I am so unhappy. I wish there was a sticker with instructions upon arrival so as to avoid ruining it. Money down the drain."
1,Rusted in a week of use.,DOnt know if i dint know how to maintain a cast iron or what...but this skillet started rusting in a week after i started using it. Just saw a good deal and purchased it and I regret it now.
3,a nice sturdy griddle at a good price,"This is a solid, old-timey cast iron griddle. It's sturdy (read: very heavy for its size), distributes heat nicely, and does the job. I was hoping for a little more non-stickiness (I follow the instructions to season with a little oil after every use, but I still find that eggs stick a little bit) but my expectations weren't too wild to begin with. It makes nice pancakes. The lip is pretty low, so this is not the pan to use to sautee a bunch of veggies or roast a chicken. But for pancakes, fried eggs, and similar low-lying fryable items, it's a good low-tech tool."
5,Why bother with other cookware?,"My wife bought this for me over the Memorial Day weekend. Even though Lodge claims their skillets are pre-seasoned, I still ran it through my own seasoning process a couple of times (light coat of shortening over the entire skillet and into the oven at 350 degrees for an hour - let it cool in the oven to room temperature).Today, I cooked a couple of eggs on the skillet (with a dab of bacon fat)and they slid right off the pan with ease. Rinsed the skillet in hot water, placed it back on the burner to dry off and I was done. This is my fourth cast iron skillet purchase since April, 2011. I wish I had known about cast iron skillets sooner so I wouldn't have wasted my money on other cookware where the non-stick surface wears off or the pan warps over time."
5,Great Griddle,"I have owned a round Lodge griddle for years and use it almost daily. It lives on the back burner of my stove for easy access. I use this griddle for grilled sandwiches, eggs, pancakes, and warming tortillas. Do let the griddle pre-heat to distribute the heat evenly and keep it lightly oiled. Clean up is a breeze and I don't worry about particles on non-stick chemicals getting into my food. Love it."
1,Non Stick my foot!,"First this product was just thrown in the box. When it arrived, the handle was sticking out the side of the box!Second, They had glued several labels to the Cooking surface. We had a terible time prying them loose.Third, EVERYTHING sticks to the surface.I grew up with cast iron. I have other cast iron pans. They all work perfect.I can not figure out what they did to the surface that causes this.I have even tried to scrub the surace and then re-season the iron.No luck.How did they mess up a cast iron pan??"
4,Love it,"I love to make pancakes on this. I've also made fried eggs on it, with no sticking. The pancakes are usually a golden brown."
5,Works well...,"works well so far...it heats up evenly and is great and convenient to make omelettes, fried eggs etc..."
5,Great for making 3 egg omlets,"I love cooking with cast iron. This pan is great for making those 3 egg omlets, pancakes, fried eggs, etc. The low lip makes it easy to get the spatula under the eggs and flip them. On the down side if you fry bacon or sausages in it, the grease will spatter the stove. On a campfire that of course won't be a problem.However if you have limited space in your kitchen cabinet get the combo cooker. The lid is nearly as large as this one and you get the fry pan as well.On the plus side, this pan being thin fits right under the stack of cast iron pans I already own. So if you cook for a large family and want to serve everyone faster, this is a good way to go as an additional pan."
4,Good Dosa making pan,"It is worth trying this product before throwing out several hundred dollars on more expensive cooking sets. Although the food sticks to the pan initially but with enough seasoning you would enjoy this product eventually.Pros:1) Dosa tastes better2) cheap compared to expensive Calaphalon3) rugged, durable and retains heat4) cooks twice as fast compared to non-stick pans5) Overall, We decided to try this pan before spending 250.00 on Calaphalon set and we are very happy with our decision to try this one out first.6) scratch resistantCons:1) Heavy to use2) sticks to pan initially although pre-seasoned (check in other reviews for pan seasoning)3) Need to use little oil for seasoning ( we use oil spray)4) Never use soap and scrub to wash the Griddle (Wipe it out when hot and apply seasoning for future use)5) takes little longer to heat up."
3,Lodge Logic Comal,"This comal is big and heavy like I expected it to be. They say it comes preseasoned, but it still needs another round or two of proper seasoning. The surface is rougher than I've found on other cast iron cookware so things like pancakes really stick and come apart. But, it works great for heating up tortillas and making quesadillas.I chose it because our family is moving away from poisoning ourselves with the Teflon from non-stick pans and other cookware."
4,Great Item,The pan is great for easy spatula access (no walls to climb over).Take care not to soak the pan for long after use. It's iron after all.Great if you take care to follow the rules of iron cooking.
3,I wish the griddle were of thicker bottom.,"Since the griddle is somewhat light weight, it heats up quickly, That results in food sticking to the surface. The seasoned surface got stripped off when the cured turkey bacon was fried. Now food sticks to it despite re-seasoning the surface."
4,Met Expectations,This looks small than i have expected. but does it job quite good.It become hot very quick i use this one for making pancakes they turned out well
5,firstcastironskillet,first cast skillet that I have purchased and it is really great for tortillas as well a other things too!
5,Pan of the gods!,"My mom recently gave me one like this that she got when she got married in the 50's. I liked it so much, I went on a hunt for a similar product for my weekend place and my mother-in-laws house. I found it! This griddle is the bomb! I love that the edges have a small lip so you can cook things like scrambled eggs without them oozing out everywhere! As good as my antique one!"
4,Needs to be seasoned,"Most people probably already know that you have to season a cast iron griddle even if it comes pre-seasoned, but I didn't. I bought it especially for crepes, but the batter sticks to it very quickly no matter how much oil/butter I use. I will need to cook other things in it for awhile before it will be seasoned enough for crepes. Otherwise, it is a well-made cast iron griddle."
1,WHAT THEY SELL AS CAST IRON NOW IS CRAP,I learned to cook on cast iron 50 years ago. What they sell now as cast iron is crap. Good cast iron cookware is surfaced on the inside bottom then seasoned so you have a flat surface. This junk they pass off now has all the grit of the sand mold left on the inside. You would need a heavy grinder to make this stuff useable.IT'S TOTALLY WORTHLESS JUNK.
1,Do not buy - read review.,"This is not a non-stick cast-iron pan. I have been using cast iron for 25 years, and this does not behave like it. I used this twice - the second time after seasoning it in the proper manner for cast-iron (despite it being labelled ""pre-seasoned"")Toasting sandwich bread causes it to stick. FRYING BACON makes the bacon catch and char before all of it has properly cooked. I have not wasted pancake batter on this, as it does not even fry an egg evenly without wasting most of it.As some of the other reviewers noted, it could be that I got a ""damaged"" pan (seconds, discarded from retail sale) - but it seems that the chance of getting such a one is quite high.I will be throwing this pan out, rather than waste my time and food trying to use it for even the simplest things.Lodge Logic L9OG3 Pre-Seasoned 10-1/2-Inch Round Griddle"
5,Well guess what Mr./Mrs. Pancake lover.,I love the food at IHOP!!! I DON'T however like their prices or noise level. I got my 1st Lodge pan 45 years ago. It was rusted but I learned how to clean and season the pan. I was happy when my glass top stove/oven went south because glass and cast iron don't mix. PERIOD! Your favorite recipies are easy to download of all the great receipe sites and also get creative as well. I love to make Dinner main menus crepes using ANYTHING you want. Most of my Ironware were throw anways. Good for me!!! I did buy a griddle for the only reason to make breakfast for me girlfriend on the back porch before a dip in the hotub. Get creative.. Stay creative.. If you can imagine it you can make it!!!!!!! I'll make a bet with you that next you will be planting a herb and veggie garden. Just a thought. Bon Appetite!!! and learn to LOVE your IRON. Best Wishes!!!
2,got rusted!,"bad quality! in less than 2 months, mine got all rusted in the bottom... and i take care of it very well.... no soap, only hot water, dry it immediately and put some oil... and all that stuff for nothing! very disappointed!"
2,Did not work for me,"Unlike all the great reviews, I did not find this a good buy.- seemed too light- batter was sticking to the panThis is a good size pan though, so if the batter isn't too sticky, this may work for others.For me, a cheaper pan I got at Sears works better - that Sears pan is a lot heavier than this one."
3,Disappointing,"I have used this griddle for two months now and I do not like it. Although seasoned food still sticks to it, the entire pan remains hot for a long time and it is very hard to clean. I am at the point where I am ready to donate it and buy another type of griddle."
2,Very Heavy,I ordered this along with Futura pan to make crepes / dosas. This one is very heavy to use with one hand even for a average man. The handle gets very hot & takes time to cool down. The package came in plastic wrap & not in original factory packing.
1,Reviews not worth for this product,"I buy product reading reviews on Amazon, but this product gave me very bad result as per the reviews.I cannot make chapati on ceramic stove using it as they stick and burn. Even Dosas and Crepe not come out too well on it.It gets heated too soon and the food get burn very fast."
5,Great little grill,"Great little grill. We use it almost daily and it's so easy to clean. Reheat tortillas, grill eggs, pancakes, etc. Best kitchen equipment I have purchasd in a long while."
1,"If I wanted coarse sandpaper, I would have ordered some.","Extremely rough surface, no amount of seasoning could smooth it. Reply to Email to Lodge, stated that finishing the pans would increase cost too much. I don't have a surface grinder, what it needed, so an hour with an orbital sander with mostly coarse emery paper gave me a surface I could season smooth. Cook and egg on it as it arrived and you'd have to clean it with the help of an ant hill. Made me give on cast iron. Bought a set of Wolfgang Puck Stainless that heats more evenly on induction than this pan. Only keeping it in case of a home invasion."
3,Not Sure,"The directions says that the griddle had been pre-seasoned. However, I oiled it prior to using and my pancakes still stuck. I am going to season it myself and see if cooks any better. Not real happy right now."
5,Nicely seasoned and a good addition to the kitchen.,"As I said, it came in with a great seasoning already in place. It's a great addition to the kitchen for those who want to make pancakes or other griddle type items."
5,Best Round Griddle ever !~!*,"Just love the round griddle already seasoned and ready to make the best pancakes, corn cakes and endless FRIED to death yummies (crispy fried porkshops are not to be beat) - Super easy to clean and is good quality stuff. I just love LODGE LOGIC cast iron - its my alltime favorite. With good care this should last a long while. I just have to remember putting a light coat of veggie oil after cleaning - its worth the extra step -"
4,Thought it was bigger,"Im not sure what I was thinking, but for some reason I thought this griddle would be larger. Its a nice size for smaller meals, and will be great for making quesadilla's or eggs for two. If you want to make eggs or pancakes for a larger crowd tho, don't get this griddle. It won't be big enough. I will look around for something a bit bigger."
1,Lodge won't answer emails about gluten contamination?,"I bought, rinsed, wiped down and immediately used this pan to make Gluten Free pancakes.My body reacted as if there was gluten or gluten contamination on the pan.I wrote two emails to Lodge, asking if their pre-seasoning was Gluten Free...but its beenweeks and they never responded.Now I have a pan that I cannot use.If you are gluten free-don't trust this pan!(And shame on Lodge for never answering emails!)"
1,Impossible to make crpes!!,"The item description is totally wrong, it's not smooth, it has a gritty surface.It makes it impossible to make crpes. I even coated it with oil and the result was the same.No, it's not my recipe! I'm French and it's the recipe that I have been using for years."
3,Bad Design,The design is not good to distribute heat. Where the edge comes up it need to fold around the outside of the griddle to form a upside down semicircle. This space will create a heat trap to make the heat more even.It is not bad but could be a better design...
1,They should have 0 star rating one is too much for this,"I don't know how much this pan is worth for scrap metal, but that is all the value it might have....definetely not for cooking crepes. How can u take the crepe of the pan, or turn it around, when it sticks to the pan??? My older pan that I have worked great, so I said to give it a try and get a more professional one....too bad, do not buy this piece of crap."
1,Don't Buy This,Don't Buy This girdle is complete crap is better to buy from store this one have minor defects this one have small holes and that make me so mad i am not going to buy Lodge Logic and this crap is made in USA Yeah OK Wherever Don't Buy This crap.Think twice before you buy online!
5,great cast iron griddle,"I absolutely love my cast iron griddle by lodge logic! It helps me make awesome pancakes and great grilled cheese! Just remember to never use soap when cleaning,(I use a sturdy nylon brush and water) and rub a little vegetable oil on it with a clean paper towel before putting it away and you'll be good to go!"
3,Good size; not preseasoned enough,"We're enjoying the griddle, but we sometimes have trouble with food sticking to it. We're planning to season it again ourselves and see if that works."
5,Great Crepe Pan,"Needed a pan for crepes, this fits the bill just fine, nice and heavy, thought it would have a thicker bottom, obviously you need a pot holder for handle. But is alot cheaper then other 'crepe' pans. All the same, it works for me. American Made!"
3,Masterpiece....maybe not,"Proportions, materials, functionality - masterpiece. Just make sure to season very well ( couple times maybe in 440- 470. Do not wash cast iron and forget soup and scrubbing and you will have Teflon performance without health hazards.PS I am updating my review, since have been trying to work with this pan for the longest time. Additional seasoning does not seem to make it better. Surface is a bit to coarse, I doubt if this will become good to what I expect from cast iron. I have one skillet from Lodge that does not seem to have such problem."
3,Lodge cast iron,"I wish that Lodge would finish the inside of their product. I have Taiwanese cast iron that have smooth insides which will season to almost a mirror image. Merely saying that Lodge products are already seasoned is a misleading- all that is is putting a carbonized oil coat on the metal- not that big a deal, and not that important when the insides are rough. But I find that I have to work on smoothing the inside of every new Lodge product I get. If they could smooth the inside surfaces their products would be much better.On the Other hand I liked the size of this griddle, with the low sides making working with the food easier."
3,A Great Start for the Polonia Brothers...,"Feeders 2 is just one of the many movies by the Polonia brothers. Although I have only seen Feeders and Feeders 2, it can be seen that they have pure talent. If only they could get a real camera for filming instead of the standards used for home movies. Maybe if we all bought a copy of this movie, the Polonia brothers could get enough money to afford life like aliens and even get some much needed acting lessons. I'm sure that if they had some money and a real studio to work in, this could be a definite masterpiece. If anything else, this movie is great to laugh at. Buy it only if you have money to spare."
1,The dumbest movie ever made,"This movie is so bad it isn't even funny. I saw the first of the ""Feeders"" movies and it was a little better. Feeders II should be avoided at all costs unless you want to see what a few styrofoam balls and some model paint can do. DO NOT SEE!!!"
1,Why do cats sulk,Not a very cleanly book. Book smelled. Not saying it is the sellers faulty but it was dirty with cat bodily waste
1,Absolute Rip-Off,"This is a ridiculously priced compilation of disco songs packaged to trick you into thinking it's the ""soundtrack"" to the stage show. It's not. You can get these songs anywhere for much, much less! This is a complete and utter rip off! Don't be fooled as I was."
2,Sounds like a college show choir.,The group numbers and there are many sound identical. I was thinking of flying to London and seeing this show. I changed my mind after listening. The CD booklet is not a booklet but a mini-poster and a cute idea.
5,Priscilla Queen of the Desert Original Case CD,"Saw this play in London the week it opened in preview. This has to be the most fun we have had at the theatre in years. The whole cast were great including the bus of the title. Every disco hit you could ever remember is in it. The theatre was rocking with the music , the laughter and even a couple of tears. Bought this cast albumn while in London and love it. Keep it in my car to listen to every day."
4,Dance around your living room!,"Anyone who loves modern musicals, disco or just dancing around the living room will have a great time listening to Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. I ordered, it arrived without delay and at a reasonable price - which was especially great because it wasn't for sale in ANY store in the city in which I live."
5,Wonderful! I couldn't put it down!,"Seventeen-year-old Mel decides to redecorate and remodel her filthy and rundown house after her mother goes to a mental hospital due to a mental breakdown. While searching for furniture at a junk shop, she meets Mitch Hamilton, who turns out to be a famous rock star! This book is great!"
4,Good times,Love Lara Croft... But my husband finished this game in one day. LIke he got home from work started playing and was done by bedtime total of maybe 6 hours. I think that is not worth the money. Of course he did the same thing with Myst. Bought it for him for Xmas last year and he was done by the next morning. Overall we were pleased with this game. There was some parts that actually stumped him and that is amazing!
5,A Tomb Raider even I can play!,"Okay, first and foremost, my kids refer to me playfully as being video game challenged. It's not that I can't play them, but that I don't play them constantly, so I'm not going to be the best or fastest player but simply play for the enjoyment of it. I very well remember all the original Tomb Raider games for the PS1. And I also remember how hard some of them were.Yes, this game does indeed seem shorter than the old TR games, but what is here in Legend is a delight. Gone is the learning curve of trying to manipulate Lara, taking with it the frustration, yet leaving the great sense of challenge and adventure as the beautiful locations are explored.My family and I absolutely love this game."
2,Fun while it lasted...but it sure didn't last.,"I'll just say, this is the shortest PS2 game I've ever played. It would be forgivable if the ending was big and explosive, keeping you hungry for more...but it just fell flat.The gameplay was way better than the last, for sure, and was enjoyable. But I would have rather waited longer for a fuller game, one with more levels and a final boss that takes more than 2 minutes to defeat.My advice...wait until this is a greatest hits title. Don't pay more than twenty bucks. You will regret it."
1,Tomb Raider Legend,"I am a die hard TR fan. Own every game ever made. I couldn't wait for this game to come out and paid the price. I was so disappointed with this. This is not the Tomb Raider I have loved so much. I guess the familiarity from the other games is one of the things I enjoyed the most. There is no familiarity to this game except she looks like Lara Croft. What a jip this game is. It's obvious that this wasn't created by the original people, just another one of those games that bore me. I won't comment on the details as other reviewers have done that already. Anyway, my review would be too lengthy if I did. I know others were so disappointed in Angel of Darkness but in my opinion it was a heck of alot better than this mess. Lara was unique in the older games, in this one she is just another robotic clone of the rest of the stiff shut'em ups."
2,too bad,"Angel of darkness wasn't all that bad.It was those wierd screen-space controlsthat made in unplayable. One would think thatthis would be the first thing to fix but, no.Still the same disorientating controls, that areconstantly changing, depending on the (oftenjust as disorientating) camera.Why?!Angel of darkness, Legend, same major flaw.I gave it 2 stars because it looks nice."
4,This was for my daughter....,"My 10 year old loves playing this game. I think (from what I've watched, not played) that they did a god job with the game. Certainly better then the old original ones (that I have played)."
3,"Wonderful game, but too short","Let me begin by saying I love the Tomb Raider games. It's awesome to be able to play a strong female character in games. The graphics were great, the game play was classic Tomb Raider style with a few new tricks. I really enjoyed the motorcycle racing, but the game was over far too quickly. For the price of the game new (when it first released) I really expected more game time for the money paid. The shortness of the game is the reason I gave it a rating of 3, but the overall game play was spectacular, so that got a 5. Definitely a worthy addition to the series, just PLEASE make the next one longer."
4,First time TR player but total Lara Fan!!!!,"I am a five year seasoned gamester. Having just completed TRL (my first TR game) I have to agree with the other posts. I was greatly disappointed with the length of the game. I am use to quest games that equal the length of Zelda, Primal, Final Fantasy V and Eternal Darkness. Some of the puzzles were a bit challenging but left me kinda hangin. The graphics were great besides being a bit dark even after adjusting my TV and game settings. But overall it was a great game and challenging at times. I just wish it was longer and more complex."
4,Rushed,"They could have taken another year on this game. I wouldn't have minded. It came out a lot sooner than I was expecting. And the results are less than perfect. My biggest problem is the camera. It's way too loose and often difficult to use. My other problem is the length of the game. Too short. Yes, this is probably the best Tomb Raider game ever made, but it could have been so much better if they just took more time on it.Graphics: 4.5Control: 4.0Sound: 4.5Fun Factor: 4.0"
3,"Good food, cheap!","If you like to eat video games, this one is just delectable! It is kind of hard on the teeth, though. I would rather eat a Rudiger any day. Whatever that is!"
4,My Baby Girl wanted it,"My youngest daughter had one of these games, but it got destroyed. She was so happy to get the new one. She plays it for hours."
3,Smog - 'Supper' (Drag City),"I'm vaguely familiar with this artist, Smog - which is basically a one-man outfit (for the most part) Bill Callahan. Didn't know Smog had as many different CD's out as they do. This title reminds me of Lou Reed - very much so. Some of the tunes here I sort of liked were ""Feather By Feather"", ""Ambition"" and ""Truth Serum"". Line-up: Bill Callahan - guitar, piano, organ & vocals, Andy Hopkins - guitar, Ryan Hembrey - bass & cello and Rian Murphy. Best possible description of this music is lo-fi sadcore (I mean, is that even a genre?). Might appeal to some fans of - say Joy Division, Pulp and perhaps Liz Phair."
4,Inexpensible theft deterrent,"Works well. I've had them on other vehicle wheels before. Just be careful leaving it exposed to the elements, it may rust on you, then you'll have problems removing them. I've broken the key when I used the standard tire iron that came with the cars. You really need to use the ones shaped like a cross to alleviate the offset stress when loosening the nut. McGard was very good at sending a replacement. A true lifetime warranty. Kudos to them!"
5,Good companion pan,"This pan, coupled with the 2 quart, 6 quart and/or 8 quart, and used in a stacked position with the briquettes on lids will cook your entire meal from main course to dessert! A handy addition to my dutch ovens."
5,6 Qt. Dutch Oven,This one was a little hard to find in the maze of those available. It arrived in excellent condition ahead of schedule. It fits perfectly with other Lodge products we have purchased.
5,Dutch Oven,I purchased 3 of these for christmas gifts for my married children. They look awesome. Wish I had thought to purchase one for myself!
5,Lodge Dutch Oven,It's great. Made chili and then the corn bread; roasted a whole chicken - delicious! The true camper must have one of these. Shipped and received as promised.
5,The best of the BEST,As I have already stated in my review of the 2 qt Lodge cast iron dutch oven........There's no way to beat Lodge cast iron cookware. This Lodge 6 quart dutch oven is no exception. That's all there is to it.
1,Wrong Photo,"This would be a great buy if the picture and the product description matched. The picture shows the Lewis & Clark commemorative oven, but the product code indicates the standard Logic 12"" oven. This is a common error on the part of Amazon, mismatched picture and product. Also, be careful of their pricing claims, on the 8"" oven they advertise lowest price of the season, but the oven was $8 cheaper the week before. Make sure you know your product before you buy - save yourself a major disappointment.Update 6/30/04: Getting closer to the truth, the picture is now correct for the product, but the description is still off. Per Lodge, the depth of the L12CO3 is 3 3/4 inches, not 4. This could possibly mislead people into believing the advertised oven is the ""deep"" version."
1,Cracked,"This was a Christmas request for my husband. He just went to cook in it for the first time and found a thin crack beginning at the lip and it moves down about 2/3's of the way into the pot, not easy to see. He was preparing a meal from the cook book we also bought and all the tools that were recommended are close by. So frustrating as it was not inexpensive.We are not able to return it without paying shipping and only getting a partial refund because we are two days past the return date. Since it is damaged, it seems this item should be replaced. We are Very unhappy customers."
5,Amazing,You want to hear sounds of the soul ... Silver Wheel of Stars will lead you in the right direction.:)kel
1,Over Rated Ego Maniac Has Toots His Own Horn,"Sheriff ""Joke"" Arpaio, Arizona's Ego Maniac has his own book. Read on how he rapes the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office and the citizens of Maricopa County of their civil rights!"
5,Dealing with crime and punishment,"This book takes a hard look at the criminal justice system in America and makes honest and realistic assesments. It offers proven solutions to the problems faced by law enforcement agencies nationwide. It is well known that people of the liberal persuesion dislike Sherrif Joe Arpaio, but the PEOPLE of Arizona have given him the highest approval rating of any law enforcement official in the country. This speaks for itself."
5,America's Toughest Sheriff: How We Can Win the War Against,Excellent book! We need more Law Enforcement officials like Joe!
3,I honestly don't remember....,"I went on a Jerome Jerome kick and decided to read everything he wrote, in no particular order. I don't recommend this practice, because after a few you realize that it's all a blur! And now I have trouble distinguishing this title from the rest. But I can say that they are all clever, witty and outdated in a fun way (learn something about ""olden"" times - and that people and their cares have been the same for centuries). As the author ages his circumstances change (marriage, kids, etc.), so it would have helped to know their chronological order and follow it before I started the endeavor. It's been a few months (and dozens of books) since I read this, and I don't remember the premise - which may be all you need to know as a recommendation on whether or not to read it :)."
2,not the best opera,they have made something better. the sound is olways the same but the songs seem to be tired and pushed. you can buy something else from shaw&blades
5,More Please!,"I've never written one of these and probably won't again unless Shaw Blades releases another like Hallucination. Guys, the covers are nice, but why do I want to listen to what I already know when you are capable of producing your own original (and excellent) work. To the listening public: buy this one, enjoy it and join me in beating the drum for MORE!"
4,An Underrated Gem!!!!,"I'm so glad I found this CD on Amazon.com! This had been stolen from me a few years ago and I've been searching for it in second hand CD stores and bargain bins rather than paying ful price again for it, but I miss the blend of meoldy and harmony that I have to give in and get it!There is just an aura of good fun on this CD. It always seemed to me that Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw were just sitting across from each other smiling at how easy it seemed to do this. Like two old friends jamming on a porch to old Beatles tunes, such as the song ""My Hallucination"" mentions.My personal favorite though was ""This Is the End"", The Doors had a morose and maudlin song of similar title and this song was such a contrast to me that it has always stuck with me. I got the feeling that eventhough they were saying goodbye, it wasn't the last we'd be hearing of them."
4,"Goodnight, goodnight....","This Bond soundtrack has really grown on me over time. The movie itself is often ridiculed but I now think it has some strong points after viewing it recently on the blu ray format. The music is great all throughout the adventure. Lulu's belting out of sexy lyrics is a joy to listen to, so are all the variations of John Barry's creativity that pop up in various ways. A good soundtrack for sure."
3,Why no bonus tracks?!?,"If you already have this soundtrack (or Dr.No, From Russia With Love, Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, Octopussy, or Goldeneye) on cd--save your money--you aren't getting anything new. I was thrilled when I saw the ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" soundtrack was released with additional music--the best Bond soundtrack ever! I was even more excited to find that several of the Bond soundtracks in the ""Remastered"" series were being released with additional cues not on the original cd/album. But why not all of them? Bond movies have some of the best music ever paired with film, and a lot of really good cues were left off the soundtrack albums. Come on and give us our Moneypenny's worth--if you're going to add tracks to some of the 007 soundtracks, do it for all of them!"
2,John Barry's worst entry in the Bond series...,"Maybe it's just me, but I think 'The Man With The Golden Gun' was truly a sign that Barry was getting tired of arranging Bond film scores, especially after coming out with the magnificent 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' and 'Diamonds Are Forever' as his latest contributions prior to this 1974 entry. Perhaps the storyline had much to do with it, but the music here is uninspiring, the theme song not one of my favorites and as others have pointed out, lacking in any extra tracks.If there is one remastered CD to potentially avoid it is this one, but Barry would make another wonderful effort 5 years later with 'Moonraker'"
5,Review of American Art Glass,"This is an excellent piece of work. It will be of much interest to any serious collector of American glass. The photographs are very good, the historical perspective is to be commended, and the pricing of pieces seems to be well researched. Of course, the focus is on high end items and categories of glass so that it is not a stand alone reference for all ""art glass"" produced in the United States. Nor should it be. It is a fine book to be part of a collector's resources on the subject."
3,I guess I'm a little disappointed.,"Definitely some great pieces of glass in this book. However, I found the printing of the images rather dark and sometimes lacking clarity....the pictures are a little fuzzy or out of focus on some pages. Some pages were much better than others for photo detail. In addition, there was a large section devoted to pictures of stained glass catalogs and glass factory postcards that I didn't find particularly useful...I guess I'm a little disappointed in the book overall, despite it still being a good reference for American art glass."
4,Good reference,"Clear drawings of marks. Good information on types of glass and makers. Catalogue reprints, ad reprints, and photographs from factories included."
3,more of a history book,This book gives a good background and history of art glass but has limited pictures and prices on actually art glass. Good for hardcore people who like the history.
3,Good Glass information,"This book is a good ""starter"" book for anyone interested in Art Glass. It gives you a great starting point for learning about Art Glass."
2,Not looking forward to the next one,"In the liner notes to KOJAK VARIETY, EC mentions that he considers this CD the first volume in a series. My question is ""Why?"" This mixed bag of R&B, ballads and the occasional well-known classic (Ray Davies ""Days"") is unsatisfying to say the least. Actually the liner notes are the best part, insightful looks at Costello's past and how his taste in music developed. The problem is I don't understand why Costello needed to make this record. Better he had put his name on a compilation of original recordings and let the listener in on what motivated him to create CD's like GET HAPPY. As it stands this CD is just a mistake. Costello's take on the various tunes lack the vitality of his original work and even the songs he should make his own, like Randy Newman's ""I've Been Wrong Before"" and ""Days"" are more annoying than memorable. If KOJAK VARIETY Vol. 2 does appear as promised, I think I'll skip it."
3,The best three-star cover album you'll ever listen too!,"The highlights make the mistakes on this album forgivable:""Remove this Doubt"" puts a huge grin on my face - Elvis as a Supreme...brilliant fun!""I Threw It All Away"" - a better performance of a great Dylan song than the original.""Strange"" and ""Must You Throw Dirt in my Face"" - hilarious! I hope Elvis wants us to laugh with him at these performances - I think he does....The rest of the songs range from pretty cool (""The Very Thought of You"") to head-scratchers (""Leave My Kitten Alone,"" ""Bama Lama..whatever"") and of course, don't buy this one if you have any significant holes in your EC collection. But this is a more satisfying album for me than Goodbye Cruel World and even All This Useless Beauty. I know I'm probably about the only EC fan who likes Kojak more than Beauty, but there you have it. It's worth it for the Dylan and Supremes numbers, and you may find enjoyment in some of the other pieces where I have not."
2,A Big Disappointment,"Costello`s 1995 album Kojak Variety is a collection of songs Costello wished he'd written himself. I hate to say this, but I feel he lacks inspiration on many of these songs; especially on most of the slow ballads.Of course there are good tracks here, but they're few.My clear favourites are ""Pouring Water on a Drowning Man"" and the obscure Bacharach song ""Please Stay"". Both songs are performed like the were his own songs.""Strange"", ""I Threw it All Away"" and ""Must You Throw Dirt in My Face"" are good too.The rest of the songs are either uninteresting, uninspired or downright bad; Ray Davies`""Days"" is the worst of all. Costello succeeds in turning one of Ray Davies' best songs into the worst track!"
1,This isn't very good,"I bought this record when it came out and have listened to it a few times since. I sort of like Strange, but I don't like much else on this record. Unless you have some ambition to own everything that Elvis ever recorded, don't buy this record."
2,GOOD? NO.,"it's funny to give an EC album such a poor rating, but this record is really quite horrible. easily the worst thing he's ever done, it's pointless and the performances sound lazy and uninspired. if nothing else, this proves the man is human -- there have been many times when i had my doubts...."
5,Hot Music,This is a VERY hot album. If you like your club music fly and soulful buy this record. I highly recommend it.
3,Good House Music,Good for an easy chill. I think Kaskade's work has matured. Has a nice mix of tempo.3.5 stars from me.
4,"Kaskade - It's You, It's Me","Sweet and deep, that's the best way to describe Kaskade's debut album, IT'S YOU, IT'S ME on San Francisco's powerhouse label Om. ""Meditation to the Groove"" sets the mood immediately, with a driving beat, sinewy vocals, and sensuous chords, while ""I Feel Like"" sounds like a kissing cousin of Dirty Vegas' hit ""Days Go By."" ""What I Say"" and ""Get Busy"" introduce smooth grooves that are sure to help you get into the pants of your honey, while ""This Rhythm"" goes for some broken beats and diva vocals. The title track adds a bit of guitar flavor for variety, and it's worth it (though the riffs can get annoying at times). ""Charlie's Plight"" goes downtempo with a tinge of sadness. ""Close"" brings the album to an end with sweetness and light. Despite some flaws, most notably lack of variation within the tracks themselves, Kaskade has made one of those rare house albums that sounds good outside of a club as well."
1,Be advised,"The wording in the description is a little vague.If you buy this toy you not only have to provide a 9v battery for the controller, you must also purchase the $20 battery and charger."
5,Great movie!,"I vaguely remembered this movie from my childhood, and couldn't wait to get hold of it again! I actually bought it used, since the new prices were more than I wanted to spend. The DVD played perfectly, and the case was in great condition. It brought back memories of when I was little, watching this with my siblings. Wonderful movie for children, it teaches valuable lessons by way of an action-packed cartoon. It keeps creativity alive by portraying a magical transformation of a boy into a bird, but includes realistic problems and relationships. I will definitely be sharing this movie with my children in the future!"
5,Great Little Story,The graphics definitely tell the age of this movie but my daughter remembered this movie from when she was young and wanted to share it with my granddaughter...I have to say they both loved it!
1,Bad Copy,"Recently bought this Dvd. I know this movie is old, but the quality on this copy is Horrible! The music overpowers the voices and you can hardly hear them, and that's with the TV on Max Volume. It changes volume all throughout the movie and goes from loud to soft throughout the entire film. I'm not sure if this is just my copy or others also."
1,Poor quality DVD,"There is nothing wrong with the film or story, but this DVD has horrible sound quality. You can hardly hear the characters' dialogue over the music and the volume is very strange. I saw another customer reporting the same problem."
5,Your lodge will outlive you,"The effectiveness of this dutch oven lies in its design which served chuck wagons a century ago and campers today! Cast Iron is ALWAYS a good value for the money and it's indestructable (I'm still using my mother's Lodge skillet that she got for a wedding gift in 1954). This dutch oven, designed specifically for the camp or fireplace cook, goes from the fire to the table with ease. It stews and bakes beautifully - get a dutch oven cookbook and learn how to make campfire biscuits as well as those stews and chilis! Also makes a fabulous wedding, shower, or housewarming gift. Forget expensive wedding registries - buy the bride a lodge dutch oven and skillet. She'll hand them down to the next generation. Every camper can use this and so can every backyard griller. Highly recommend!"
5,a little knowledge and a good recipe.,"I bought one of these babies, and decided in one week that I was going to be a camp cook. I invited a couple of friends to a park on a cool evening in October in Iowa. I had laid in the wood and adult beverages. I made a seven grain rye roll recipe at home and let them rise cool. My first time camp bead baking was simply spectacular. I did two pans and the first was almost gone before the second was done. It may be a fluke, but if you are a good cook and you have the proper intuitive skills, this type of cooking is not that much different than at home. Just a note, the shallower ovens such as this are referred to as bread ovens- mine did just fine-deeper ones are the stewing/roasting type."
4,fun set,"two minutes into this double cd, and you will remember why you love jazz in the first place--it's flat out fun! occasionally, jazz artists, critics, fans, et al, get lost in their own rhetoric defending the art of jazz and forget that jazz, like all music, is supposed to be fun. jazz is a wonderful art form, giving voice to the purely improvisational, the free spirit within us that compels us to create, to respond to our environment, and reveal the depth and breadth of feeling carried within us. mr. redman is more than proficient. he is an artist and an improviser of high order. but he also remembers to swing, to dance, and play. right from the get-go this album captures your heart and soul and for the next couple of hours holds you there. when you're done, you don't feel exhausted, but refreshed, like you would have been had you been in the vanguard the night this went down. this is a great live set by an artist who keeps right on enjoying what he's doing. enjoy!"
1,Schedule C ONLY,"WARNING: TurboTax Home & Business will NOT do 1120S for ""S"" Corps. You are forced to buy a business-only version now for this, PLUS the regular edition for personal taxes. TaxCut Home & Business includes both, and is $5 cheaper than the TurboTax Business version alone!"
2,expensive habit,"You buy it once for $90 and then next year you have to do the same thing, another $90. I don't know how much money you end up saving."
5,Turbo Tax,fine. Only question I have is would one of the less expensive products work just as well for me. I think so.
5,Easy Do-It-Yourself Tax Return,"Turbotax Federal And State Home And Business is by far the easiest and quickest way to get that much needed tax refund in your hands quickly and easily. After you gather up all of your receipts and income records, you can have your tax return submitted that same day."
2,hated it!,thought it was difficult to understand and enter correct info especially for the home business section. Its not for the person who just starts a home business and wants to use to do their taxes.
5,Satisfied Customer,"I own a small business and used to use a tax accountant to prepare my taxes. But, much like the TurboTax commercial, I decided to do it myself with TurboTax. Money magazine reviewed all of the various offerings last year and selected TurboTax as the best choice for my needs. Last year it worked great, and this year it was even easier since much of the information was pulled from last years data file. I'm very satisfied with the software."
4,getting better yearly,IT IS DIFFICULT TO GO BACK AND FIX MISTAKES USING THE OVER RIDE FUNCTIONTURBO TAX IS SLOWLY IMPROVING
3,A big step backward,"Last year, in TurboTax Deluxe, it covered all the needs of a (very) small business. I did my taxes in 20 minutes. This year, with the addition of the annoyingly bloated TurboTax for Business, it took hours. Unless they reconsider their attempt to extort more money for an inferior product, next year, I use an accountant."
5,turbo tax,I am a single mom and have never done my taxes by myself. The cost to have taxes done is ridiculous. This is the best thing ever. It walks you thru everything and is very easy to use. I will buy this product again next year..
3,Better than before,"Unlike previous years', 2006 did not make obvious importing mistakes on my taxes. It still does not do a perfect job on my State forms (NJ and NY). It was still hard to get rid of forms mistakenly entered, or imported but no longer applicable."
5,Was able to do taxes on my own without a professional,"Turbo Tax was great. I had a net operating loss with my LLC. This software handled it great. I had tried to use the IRS website, but the instructions and forms were too complicated. Turbo Tax made things very easy."
5,Humane and easy to use!,"Except for problems entering apportioned mortgage interest for home offices and cost of goods sold for for three small businesses, seems nearly as easy to use as it can be. Our problems were efficiently solved by excellent service from real TurboTax people. We sent one email with our questions and the next day received the answers in a very helpful phone call. The thorough suggestions for tax deductions, corrections of our errors, and the almost humorous running balance of taxes owed or refund due at the upper left of the screen are very good. Factoring in the price of this software, we saved over $400. by not having to pay an accountant. We anticipate that using TurboTax next year will make the job even easier."
3,Maine State processes incorrectly!,"I was happy enough with the federal portion of Turbo Tax, but wasted my money and plenty of time with the State portion. For whatever reason (Turbo Tax online & phone help didn't know) my Maine State Tax refund did not show up on Schedule 1 (and interest that WASN'T Maine tax exempt DID). On the federal forms it was fairly intuitive to figure out how to override the forms, but I had trouble even locating the state tax forms.The Maine forms are so simple, I filled them out by hand while I was on hold with Turbo Tax Help, accurately, even.I would NOT recommend purchasing the extra state. Just get the federal portion!And getting a refund ---- they say they guarantee it for 60 days. I bought it 30 days ago, and they sent me back to Amazon to get my refund.At this point it feels like more trouble than it is worth to get a refund. Hopefully none of you other Mainers will make the same foolish purchasing mistake that I made!"
5,Must have for self-employed,"I've used this product for years, and it is excellent. Must have if depreciating anything because it does all the calculations for you, and it transfers relevant data from year to year. Make sure you buy the version that includes state. Also great for itemizing deductions and finding new deductions for you."
1,A Pain in the ***,"Turbotax is okay if you only have a 1040A to file, but anything beyond that it quickly becomes a real pain in the nether region. Not only that, but if you have complications with trying to file, good luck.It looks as though I will have to pay to have my estate taxes filed. Ttax is worthless."
1,Avoid this seller,"Not only did this seller wait two weeks to ship my item (Ordered Dec 31st, shipped January 12, 2009) they sent me a used and stained filter. I had to clean the heck out of it for it to even look OK. Never again. Seller ignored all e-mails."
3,not made in Japan,"This filter was made in the Phillipines, not made in Japan as you would expect from Canon photographic equipment. For $8, I guess you can't expect too much."
1,Genuinely Awful,"I usually only review things I like. But there's something really crazy here, because Scott Glenn is a fine actor and somehow or other he has gotten involved in the kind of film almost never cast with stars. I don't know anything about the authenticity of the storyline, based on real life. But the script is the worst I've encountered in a very long time, basically a compendium of B-movie cliches thrown at you one after the other, plot holes filled by voiceover narration, etc. If you're a movie buff, you can recognize bits inspired by other films. And yet all this use of successful predecessors doesn't combine into a successful narration. It's all helter-skelter, like ""Now let's do this bit"" or ""Hey, maybe he should shoot up that car. Why? It'll be exciting."" The movie isn't boring, by the way. It just doesn't make any sense."
4,Very Good Affordable Reference,"This book has a lot to offer for a very small price. Other paperback OChem review books skimp on content -- that is not the case with this one. In some cases this book has more detail than my college text book does.It is organized as a series of questions, for example ""What is the structure of Lithium Aluminum Hydride?"" instead of the standard Topic/subtopic format. I didn't find this to be an asset, but I got used to it. The diagrams are hardly flashy, but they get the point across. I needed an Organic Chem reference because I teach an MCAT Prep course. This book is well organized and complete. I would definately recommend buying it!"
3,Good review/reference,"I used this book as a reference for my second semester organic chemistry course. It worked very well to reinforce concepts presented in my class textbook, and as a review for the first semester material (we had a comprehensive 1st and 2nd semester final). The question/answer format worked for me -- some people might find it annoying, though. This is not the book to use if you're looking for straight-forward, tabular listings of reactions. I would recommend it as a backup presentation of class material.The reason I give this book only 3 stars is that it had an inexcusable number of mistakes and misspellings, way too many to have made it past a competent editor. I found the errors to be distracting and at times it made me wonder if some of the chemistry in the text might also be in error!"
1,Wicked City,"This album is very poorly recorded, and captures GLJ on a particularly bad night. It's a soundboard recording, which means that you can't hear the audience and the vocals are too far up in the mix. In fact, it doesn't sound as if this album was mixed at all. I've spoken to Jay Aston (GLJ's lead singer) about this release, and it is most definitely UNAUTHORIZED. Don't buy it!"
5,"Great for baking ""No-Knead"" bread","You'll love using this as a Dutch oven if you use the Lahey ""no-knead"" bread method. On the You Tube video and in Lahey's ""My Bread"" book, both of which I highly recommend, they use only the much heavier and awkward larger Dutch ovens. This one is much easier to handle, an important consideration when it's heated to 500 degrees and you are dropping in a dough ball, removing and putting on the lid, all in the confines of your oven. Also, it gives the loaf a much more uniform shape as opposed the loaf baked in the larger Dutch ovens, which resemble a tired looking spaceship when they're done....Greg Smith"
5,Makes a great 1.5 lb loaf of bread,"This pot bakes a great 1.5 lb loaf of bread. I had been baking bread in the Lodge 5 qt dutch oven. This worked OK, but the the bread wasn't as high as I would have liked. This 2 qt pot worked great. I had seasoned it once after receiving it. The loaf fell right out of the pot, no sticking. Uniformaly brown. I like it."
5,Lodge Logic Pot,"I used the Lodge Logic Pot recently for the first time. I am impressed with the fact that my oven-baked dish came out so moist and flavorful. Usually, a great deal of the liquid in my covered pans would evaporate, but this was not the case with this pot. I am pleased that I purchaed this pot."
4,Nice size,It arrived today and I made my favorite south indian tamarind soup in it. I am actually happy with the size and I dont think its very small decent size to cook for 2 or 3 people. I only gave it 4 stars because i saw some black stuff peeling off of the lid. I was thinking of returning however i wiped it off and decided to keep it because the pot was good enough with no problems. I dont have vegetable oil and would like to know if it can be seasoned with any other oil.I read about the benefits of cooking in iron containers. My mom and aunt used to have iron woks to infuse some iron content into the food. I thought i should do that too for my family. best choice nice sized pot absolutely cute.
4,Big enough to make macaroni & cheese,"What I really wanted was a 2 quart pop like a sauce pan, but since I couldn't find one, i tried this dutch oven. When it arrived, I almost returned it because the box itself was so short, I thought, ""how can I possibly make mac 'n cheese in this thing""? I decided to try it, and was suprised to find that I was able to make mac 'n cheese without any spillover. However, today I made soup, and it boiled over. So it is a small pot, but it can work. The workmanship itself is great."
5,The Mind/body connection,"Dr Benson presents strong evidence for what others have called the ""mind / body connection."" Mainstream medical science has not yet recognized the importance belief plays in health but, Dr. Benson presents numerous studies that validate the major role belief plays in the healing process and wellness. Practitioners of complimentary therapies will find this book especially helpful in understanding how many non-drug based therapies can work. Well written and thought provoking!"
4,A Well Constructed Book for Those with Medical Issues,I truly enjoyed reading this book. Dr. Benson takes his extensive background in medicine and combines it with real-life stories of the divine within us. This book is for someone who is looking for the connection between the physical and the spiritual and wants to take control of their health care. I highly recommend it!
3,"Good book, but outdated","I have long been a fan of Janet Sartin skincare, but this book was written in 1980 so is not really in keeping with so many of their new products, as well as products they no longer have. It is a fairly good book for insight into the ""Sartin Method"", but I so wish she had written an updated version before she retired."
1,Not for Tough Chewers,"Lupine advertises their collars to be chew proof. That is why I purchased this collar for my puppy whose nearly one year old.My dog has been chewing through his collars and harnesses and seems to be an escape artist. I've bought four collars since I've owned him and only one collar was replaced due to his growth.My veterinarian sells the leashes at his office and I was eager to try this brand after he chewed his way out of the others.My dog tore the plastic clasp overnight and I was back at the pet store with my dog the next day.I told the store manager that I had adjusted the collar to his neck properly and I was given full purchase price and bought him a replacement collar which so far has lasted.I can't buy him any leather accessories as he likes the smell of leather and will start chewing immediately.The one feature I like about this product is their 100 percent, money back guarantee against breakage."
4,STUNNING,"This one is a keeper. The three concertos are delivered with an intensity and a passion that belies the fact that three orchestras, three different recording studios, three different soloists were pulled together to create a seamless articulation. Boulez, to his credit, holds down the center and this remains a wonder to listen to.Taken sequentially, it is an ideal program. Zimmerman tackles the first concerto with the technical prowess it requires. so much so that that the second seems to flow as a logical counterpoint. By the time you reach Helene Grimaud's poetic take on the third, you will find yourself aware how much these artists have delivered Bartok's life story. It simply is sublime and inspiring."
4,Zimerman - okay for Bartok,"Zimerman is definitely one of my top 5 pianists, however I feel as if his style is less suited for Bartok's 1st. Of course his recording was brilliant, however it was still missing power that I have heard in other recordings. Regardless this is a wonderful CD and I highly suggest purchasing it, since I have no specific other CD to offer as a ""better"" option. No. 2 and 3 are great and I see nothing wrong with the recordings supplied with Andsnes on the 2nd and Grimaud on the 3rd."
2,Disappointment from Boulez,"Boulez is supposedly a great composer/conductor. What does this mean? Does this mean he hits all the notes right? I happen to believe there is more to music than this, so his hyper-active, same-dynamic-level rendering of Bartok's Piano Concertos, particularly the famous *Second* was a great disappointment. There is little music here, despite the technical mastery. Passages that I remember gloriously from other recordings in the past sound as though they were recreated by a huge machine, and not even a MIDI computer, which now does a much better job. I don't like dissing composers and musicians, so I will stop here, but I went on and right away purchased Esa-Pekka Solonen's versions of the concertos (also available on Amazon). These performances were *so much* better. Joseph Pehrson"
3,where's the beef,I've been running for 35 years and coaching for many so I expected to pick up a book that would give some insight into a young runner's mind or some biomechanical needs of a young runner. The book is a cursory view of coaching and training. It's fine if you are just starting out with no background. But where's the meat and potatoes?
5,one of the best games in the gaming industry,"ive actually been with uo utima online since its very beginnings when richard had it , it has envolved into a game that just keeps getting better,ive been in this game for close to 15 yrs,thats actually before the first beta my guild is HHYC on the atlantic shard my char is whitefire and if u ever need in game help or need help getting started come see anyone thats in HHYC for memory this is the greatest game for eye hand corordination u cant beat it for learning english this game helps had a stroke this game helps in all the areas,i know ive had a stroke,and had to learn how to type again,couldnt remember anything now i have 3 accounts and im doing great try it out and have fun"
1,Only worth playing for the nostalgia,"If you're thinking of trying this game in the 21 century, don't bother. It's well beyond any point of enjoyment for the modern gamer. It's violently roguelike (player death more or less equates to game over, all uninsured/unblessed items are lost and the insurance system is broken), thoroughly unexplained (even after 15 years, googling simple questions returns no result) and seriously lacking in any semblance of fun until you've forced several weeks of your life into the game. The interface is unusable, most simple actions still requiring text commands that you'd never know unless you print out a list, ""quests"" offer pitiful rewards and are of basically no use, and overall the game is one, massive grindfest that never ends. If you played the game growing up or enjoy the classic, unforgiving workhorse style of games, give it a go. If not, don't even consider it."
1,"Sorry, I just do NOT understand the game. There are no online directions for me to obtain.","I am having difficulty understanding this game. There are no Online directions for this game. Often, when playing with the online characters, I have difficulty with learning character activities, such as how to fish, and other tasks for the game. I also have difficulty navigating around to the different cities. The small map, provided lacks readability, and cannot be seen very well, either. There are too many difficulties to explain. I am NOT enjoying this game, very much. I am STILL paying $ 12.95 per month for it, in hopes, that it MAY be improved, soon. Yet, if it isn't, I may be canceling the Online fees, and putting the game on a shelf, forever."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,NOT ENOUGH INFO? DID NOT SAY ONLINE GAME PLAY ONLY. IF I HAD KNOWN THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THE ITEM. IT WAS VERY FAST DELIVERY.
4,Live your character,"Ultima Online is a fun interactive role playing game where you get to live the life of your character. You improve your skills, learn a trade, sell your wares, join a guild, and build a house. It's a great game to share as a family, with friends, or make new friends from all over the world. 2D is way better than 3D! CAUTION: THIS GAME IS ADDICTIVE"
4,Talk about addicting!,"I have played this game, off & on, for the past 3 years. I've always been interested in fantasy & this is the perfect type of game for me. It's so much fun creating & customizing characters. It's frustrating, at first, because your character doesn't have the skills to do much & you're not strong enough to wear the cool armor or you don't have the gold to buy the cool clothes. The process of builing up skills is pretty tedious & boring but once you're there, the world opens up.I have mostly played on free shards where things are a little more customizable. I have enjoyed building my own houses, collecting pets, & embarking on many quests. You can meet people from all over the world. This game can be soo much fun & soo incredibly frustrating, at times. I haven't played it for a while & I miss it but, right now, I really don't want to start from scratch, AGAIN."
1,Terrible,This book is so boring.Nothing happens- there is no action or drama or anything. The beginning was so boring i could barely get through this book! I would never in my lifetime reccomend this book to anyone- escpecially children- they will get so bored of this book. I don't know what the author was thinking. I don't even reccomend any books by the same author- thats how bad it was!I have a feeling that all the good reviews that were on this book- were planted by the author. Dont anyone ever buy this book! It will bore you to tears!
5,This Book Was Great!,I loved this book! It was so interesting and it was one of those books that keep you on the edge of your seat toward the ending.
4,sung with emotion..old songs brought back to life!!,Grupo Tentacion has executed this album with style! Old songs live again...I recommend this album for anyone who likes emotion in their music!!
3,"Big on facts, low on narrative",I disagree with the two previous reviewers in that the book is full of verifiable facts (especially since the deposed Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif came out with his revelations). The thing lacking is flow in the narrative. At times the author does sound like blowing the Indian Army bugle but that is understandable in light of his background.A useful book for followers of the Indian subcontinent's defence issues.
1,weak,"The book was disapointingly weak on facts, and drew its information too much from same sources ... good for propaganda work, but no factual value for someonme looking for facts."
1,there are facts and there are facts,"I would disagree with the previous poster, the facts presented in the book are not very verifiable, indian sources created many of these facts ,and the fact that nawaz sharif is using the same facts in his own defense is not a proof, he is making these alligations to save his own skin. The indian military used a propagande cell to create many of these facts, so i belive nil in them ---"
2,Not a real page turner...,"This book bounces between the author's own trip.. which is not particularly interesting... and very brief histories of what Roman tourists were experiencing in the same places. Don't know where he got his info about the Romans but often seems like it is just copied out of some local travel brochure or a history book from the library. Not really in-depth enough to make it interesting ... for me anyway. Too bad, I was really looking forward to reading this book."
1,Disappointing,"Written in the style and maturity of an undergraduate term paper, and just as boring. The author opens each chapter with a short anecdote from his trip, usually about his girlfriend, and then proceeds to fill several pages with tired and repetitive historical information. At times I found myself wondering if the author actually had made the trip, as his anecdotes were so trite (read the section on a diving expedition). His traveling companion girlfriend comes across as the more interesting of the pair, but can't save this narrative from tedium.Try something by William Dalrymple instead"
3,new name for 'route 66ad',"Be aware that this book is exactly the same as his previous book ""Route 66AD"". I bought this thinking is was a second story about the life of the ancient romans but was sorry to discover I already had. A good read however, but for me this was a waste of money."
5,Stay home and read it.,"This is a good antidote to the travel bug, as it describes the discomforts of no star hotels and slow trains in Italy. Turkey, Greece and Egypt with a pregnant mate. (Like other reviewers I'd love to hear her side of the story but it may be a deliberate part of Perrottet's artistry that we are left largely to imagine this).As the title suggests, the theme is ancient Roman tourism, about which he is knowledgeable and entertaining. He is linked to these lands by being a classical scholar and the grandson of an ANZAC hero killed at Gallipoli. These two things separate him from the mere purveyors of comic travel anecdotes in the tradition of Mark Twain's ""Innocents Abroad"" but he is also tremendously funny. He is a master of the ""didn't seem funny at the time"" story, like the description of the Egyptian train journey and the telephone calls about disasters in his New York apartment.A nice last sentence."
4,Pagan Holiday,"There were moments that I laughed out loud, and then there were moments that I felt the copy dragged a little bit. But overall, not a bad read. Les, his pregnant girlfriend is amazingly tolerant. Thought it was strange that she felt that she couldn't stick around for the English-speaking monk in Greecefor fear that he might convert her, but then she volunteerily consumes a meal prepard by an obviously ill man in Turkey (""he wiped his nose on the back of his hand and continued to cook""). No big surprise that she turns up deathly ill the next day, but she wanted to maintain diplomacy. There were some great literary quotes in the book, references to Homer, and a lot of fun trivia."
1,Lost its tongue,Ordered the shoe on 6/25/07. The tongue on the right shoe came apart today which is 10/28/07. Poor sewing. Shoes were ok but only lasted 4 months. Played golf on Sundays for the duration and Thursdays till Sept. It is back to foot joys which last a lot longer than 4 months.
2,Golf Shoes - Sort of!!!,Not really what I expected. Should have spent more time reading the description. They leave my feet very wet after a round of golf. Next time I'll choose a brand I'm more familiar with...price influenced my decision...unfortunately.
5,Archtop Perfection,"I was speechless when I read the 1-star review. I can only conclude that the reviewer doesn't like the sound of an honest-to-goodness acoustic archtop guitar. I, on the other hand, can't get enough of this sound. On this recording Bucky sounds like the reincarnation of Carl Kress and Eddie Lang. Several of the cuts were actually written by Kress and Lang: April Kisses, Helena, Afterthoughts, etc. Hearing this glorious music in today's world is like discovering diamonds in a garbage dump. The sound of Bucky's guitar is the fattest, warmest archtop sound I've ever heard. His playing is, as always, immaculate. And the music is bursting with romance and nostalgia. If you would like to transport yourself back to about 1930, and pal around with Eddie Lang and Django Reinhardt, get this recording. Bucky is now about 84 years old, and it will be a truly bleak world for me when he is gone."
4,Undiscovered Gem,"Okay, so I'm the 1st, and maybe last, person to review this CD. I came across it when looking at the Luaka Bop website and was intrigued - I've found a few very good and pretty obscure albums put out by them. Altho I'd never heard of the movie - or heard any of the music - when I saw some of the artists (David Byrne, Zap Mama, Lou Reed, etc.) and found that I could buy it for less than $1, it looked like a good bet.It turned out to be even better than I hoped. While not every track is great, several are - especially ""God's Child,"" ""Tango Apasionado"" and ""Egg Cream."" This CD is a steal!4 stars for content, 5 stars for value."
4,A book that will fascinate you!,"Reading Forster's short story ""The Machice Stops"" made me understand and think a lot about computer use in our everyday life. His writings are like a prediction of what may come if people remain as arrogant and selfish as they already are. The book also made me think about the existance of God and the reason of our creation. I strongly recommend that you read this book having of course under consideration that it was written in 1909."
4,Moisturizing,Very moisturizing but also very sweet smelling.I have finished my first bottle but have yet to purchase another. It was a bit too sweet for my liking.
3,Meh,"Love the luxurious L'Occitane Shea Butter Lotion so I took a chance and bought this. I was hoping it would smell like Almond, it does not. Leaves a nice moisturized feel, but doesn't lather much and is nothing to write home about. It's okay. It costs a lot because of the brand, but not worth it in my opinion--you could find cheaper alternatives that are just as good/better."
2,i returned the item,hi i returned the item didnt like itwould like u to advise when my credit card will be debited the amount
4,A very good effort,"I'm a fan of Pedro the Lion and this new release took a little while to settle with me, but now that it has... i like it a lot. it's nice to see David move in a different direction musically, although his songwriting style and deft, story-like lyrics are still very much intact. i've always enjoyed his melodies the most. they just stick in your brain like the poppiest hooks you can imagine. he reminds me of elvis costello in a weird way. if you're into great melodies and intelligent lyrics that tell stories about life both good and bad take a listen. it's similar to Pedro the Lion however Headphones takes a much simpler route pairing traditional songs and writing with real drums, keyboards and electronic instruments in place of guitars. David Bazan always challenges us to listen and think. one of the great musical minds of the last 10 years, no wonder he's influenced everyone from Helio Sequence to The Way It Is."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Came with broken strings. There is no way to attach the strap. Mine was missing the tuning pitch pipe, but that's not a major loss. It's cute. I think once it's tuned, I can tighten the pegs and keep him from turning them. Bottom line, it's a cheap, cheap, guitar. Cheaper than most plastic ""toy"" ones, and actually has the potential to be playable. IF it will tune... I keep going back to the cheap price. That's all that's keeping me from sending it back. That, and my son's birthday is tomorrow..."
1,craptastic,"I wasnt expecting to much for a 25$ guitar....but really? There is shoddy glue work smeared all over the face of the guitar. The paint at the base of the neck is cracked and likely to start chipping as soon as I give this to my daughter.My husband, who is the musician, tried to tune it and was unable to; stating that the sounds produced from these strings are not and could never be in the right key.Im sure my daughter would love it as simply a toy, however, even toys are made better than this piece of garbage.We are sending it back."
4,Guitar,I bought this from my daughter's 9th Birthday. For what she want and how much she plays with it the price was good.
4,Good Starting Point for Vacation Planning,"This compilation of the best hiking trails in the Alps will give readers plenty of ideas for planning an unforgettable vacation filled with scenic beauty. All aspects of the trip are covered including accommodations, what to bring along, equipment and locale information. A vast list of tourist resources is also included. Although targeted towards Americans, this book is handy for any nationality.The reason I deducted a star is due to the fact that some is the information is outdated. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to enjoy the wondrous beauty of the Alps."
4,Great soap - find it cheaper,Alchimia soaps are great lathering scented soaps and can be found at Home Goods for $4.99. Hope this review is helpful.
2,Please explain,"Let's say, like me, you wanted to get a book on 3D Game Programming With C++, without knowing C++ beforehand, and then read it, and begin making games right away.Not going to happen.This book tells you quite a lot of interesting stuff about games and how they work under the hood, but as far as code goes, and putting it all together, all the author does is give you a list of functions and a hard-to-read encapsulation, and then say ""your turn"".He gives you NO explanation WHATSOEVER on where to write the code, etc, etc (I tried every way I could think of to enter the code on the disk, but I still got 110 errors ....The first couple of chapters are enlightening, but by the third, you begin the code, and get left behind by the author.My suggestion? Don't get this book. Learn C++ FULLY and then pick up some books on Physics and AI (this book may prove more helpful to you later on down the track (as a reference, it could be pretty handy))."
4,upgrade book,"You need to know the basics of game programming and how to program. this book is really good if you want to upgrade your game from directx 6.0 or lower to directx 7.0, however i really recommend knowing something about game programming before buying this."
2,"It's so thick, but so empty","I bought this book before reading the reviews here. It's amazing that one can read a book this size and still be not much further in his quest for knowledge.I'm somewhat glad I have the book on my bookshelf, because there's some things in there I might look back on. It's got a tiny bit of information about physics and AI.I'm still dumbfounded that the book contains not one screenshot, and not one working sample."
1,De Goes continues on cheating street,"I bought a previous book from the author, when I was intending to buy the black art book and boy was I dissappointed. In that book there was source, but it all(full screen) used ancient Borland graphics addition that was not available anywhere below 500$. There was no mention of this little fact but in the middle of the book. Nothing on the back cover - no. Nothing in 20 first pages - no. Nothing on the cover - no. All was just waste of time other than general 3D bla bla bla that's available everywhere. I remember writing an angry(but decent) email to the author. He never replied."
1,hehe I Guess Im Not The Only One.,"First Off, THANKS TO ALL THE PREVIOUS REVIEWERS! for stoping me from makeing a big mistake!I was thinking of buying this book untill i read the first review, then the second, then the third...Dose anyone else love reading reviews on bad books?"
1,This books suck,This book provides almost no examples of anythingit is a shame for the author torelease this book
1,Very Disappointing...,The previous review was right on target. The CDROM is absolutely useless. I am surprised that LaMothe endorsed this book as well. Spare yourself the trouble of having to ship it back to Amazon.
1,I'm glad I didn't buy it.,"When I first saw its cover, I really wanted to buy it. It looked promising. After went through first few chapters, I was not sure what the book is about. After I read reviews here, I'm sure I will not buy it."
1,Title is a lie... run for your life!,"There is nothing in this book about game programming. There's actually nothing in this book at all related to programming.You get 2 source files, yep count 'em --> 2. One header file and one .cpp file that define a Direct 3D wrapper class.This book does not have any examples--game or otherwise--in any of its sections. Also, less than half the book is even about ""3D"". All the rest is either about Direct Input or ripped straight from the help files that come with DirectX.Just another typical book from Coriolis."
1,I returned it the next day...,"I am a pretty avid programmer and I wanted to learn Direct3d. But, all you will find in this book is the SDK copied. This book is not very good and I brought it back to Waldens the next day to get my money back.I would recommend Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus by Andre Lamothe. It is a million times better!"
1,Extremely Dissapointing,"I had read John's previous book, and was happy with it, so I decided to order this one. It came in the mail today and I stealthed down to the basement couch and immersed myself for an hour. I feel awful giving this book a 1-star review, but it really isn't good at all. More than half the book is a rehash of the DirectX help files, the other half seems like a hurried mess, Only 250 pages or so were given to a topic that could have stretched into 700 or more. Not only that, the time that isn't spent recounting the SDK documentation is erronous! John mis-describes perepsective projection, the transformation pipeline, the set of lights supported by Direct3D, the list goes on and on.I strongly recommend against purchasing this book. :("
2,The book is not great but has a good AL section,the book is mostly about DirectX concepts not really anything about 3D game development ITS GREAT FOR DIRECTX REFERANCE! I recomend reading the Artifical Intelligance Section very useful but you will need to be a novice to understand
2,Good DirectX 7.0 Ref,"If your looking for a good DirectX 7.0 reference then this book is for you, otherwise pass. If you're looking for a good book to get started doing 3D game programming then get Mr. De Goes `Cutting-Edge 3D Game Programming with C++'."
1,Disappointed reader,I was quite shocked that a book which claims to cover 3D games progamming would devote so few pages to the actual subject. The majority of this book is a reference section devoted to documenting the DirectX API which is all ready done in great detail within the DirectX API which is supplied on the accompanying CDMy recommendations is to download or buy the DirectX API and forget this book
3,"A good reference, a poor primer","I always love it when people complain that a book doesn't teach you C++ or COM or the Win32 API even though it says 'Game Programming' on the cover. Look, first you learn the language, then you learn the cool stuff. This book assumes that you have knowledge in Windows programming, and if you don't, then why the hell are you trying to read it?That said, this book contains great referential coverage of functions, structures, and constants of DirectX (even input and sound). Unfortunately, it's damn hard to learn how to create a working project simply by reading this book. I would classify most of it as a skim-over of theory - don't expect any samples (except the few poor ones on the CD). Honestly, the samples included with the DirectX SDK have been much more helpful in learning the API than any books out there. I do, however, still use this as a reference at times."
1,SUCKS!,It is very brief(like 1 chapter) on Direct 3D.. The rest of the book looks like the Direct X SDK. NOT WORTH IT!
1,Useless,"Take my advice, listen to everyone else here, unless you're looking for a slightly flawed reference to DX7.0, don't buy this book. It is completely useless from a game programming standpoint."
3,good overview,"This book is a good reference for looking up symtoms but one shouldn't use it as their only source for information regarding the remedies. I must disagree that using a wrist-support while typing should be used to prevent Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). All that will do is simply prolong and worsen the condition. In summary, by restricting the movement of the wrist while typing you are allowing muscles in a small area to be overused one way while allowing other muscles to relax.The book is divided into two sections: symtoms and disorders. The first half of the book on symtoms is a three column table of Associated Symtoms, Possible Diagnosis and Distinguishing Features. The second and last half of the book on disorders gives overviews on each disorder. The information is far from replete but does a good job at summarizing the disorders into relatively simple terms."
5,Good to take a trip,Hard to get on but once it up there it is good for the trip. Carried all my luggage for two toddler (one is special needs so there was a lot) and two adults for 3 weeks worth.
2,tounge lock,Does not fit tight inside the hitch cavity as claimed(2 5/16 ball). Would be very nice if it only fit.
4,not a beginner book,"I think the songs in here are a good mix, although all I can do so far is play a few of the opening measures in a lot of songs. They are pretty complete though, with bass lines and 1,2 & sometimes 3 guitars all included. For someone intermediate to advanced it would be perfect but a bit frustrating for the beginner..."
2,Just Be Careful,"The songs listed on the ""look inside"" feature of this book are not the actual songs in the book that is shipping out. there is nothing wrong with the book or the songs included, but if you are expecting one set of songs nad you get another it is a bit disappointing."
2,very small tab,The music in the book is not very appealing and the tab is so small you need binoculars to read it.
4,Huge song selections!,This book truly is gigantic! A little disappointing to find this doesn't have guitar tabs but reading music is not a problem either. Would have liked to have the tabs though - especially for someone just learning how to play the guitar. Great songs included though!
2,Guitar Book,The book is a little hard to understand. Definitely NOT for beginners. It isn't as good as Hal Leonard's 100 VHS for Guitar Books.
3,Segal's first foray into the buddy genre,The Glimmer Man is Steven Segal's first forary into a buddy movie. Kennan Ivory Wayana gives some good one liners in the film and he even gets beat up a few times. The film has some nice action sequences and some chemsitry between Segal and Wayans. I give *** out of ****.
3,Glimmer Man,"Wayans is funny in this movie. Steven Seagal is a little bit slower, but still I find it entertaining and I still love him."
4,""" I woke up happy, I'm goin' to bed happy!""","The line that sets off the final fight scene in this movie. Ok, ok, I won't go into or state the obvious about Segal not being the greatest actor in the world. But this movie was fairly entertaining when you put it up against alot of other work Segal has done. Wayans provides excellent comic relief that actually for the most part works surprisingly well. Segal plays a detective with a ""mysterious past"" (C'mon Steven, you can only play this character so many times) and he teams up with Wayans to find the ""family man"", a serial killer who targets whole families with a religious twist. The action and fight scenes are pretty good. Not Segal's best, but far from his worst."
3,Some Twists on a Familiar Formula,This is not a bad Steven Seagal film. The plot is actually intriguing but did not live up to its potential due to some ineffective and uneven direction and choppy editing. The film works better as a standard detective drama forgoing anticipation of Seagal's usual physical antics.
3,about the movie Glimmer Man......,This is not a bad movie to watch (between average and good). A recommendation to those whom like this genre of movie/film. This will not be a fine movie/film if one is looking for good action based movie/film. Enjoy.....
1,could not use it-coded from another Country!,was not notified it may be coming from Another Country and it arrived with a code saying it could not be seen. It was suggested I send it back *(at my expense)to get a refund including my cost for sending it; NO THANKS!I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN HOW THIS WAS HANDLED AND AM NOT ABOUT TO PAY TO SEND IT BACK! I'LL TAKE THE LOSS OF THE MOVIE............VERY UPSET!!!The movie came from the UK!
2,DEFINITELY NOT ORIGINAL,"SEAGAL AND KEENEN IVORY WAYANS PLAY TWO COPS THAT'RE GOING AFTER A SERIAL KILLER KNOWN AS THE FAMILY MAN. SEAGAL AND WAYANS ARE DEFINITELY NOT GIBSON AND GLOVER. BUT THIS MOVIE ISN'T AND COULD NEVER BE ''LETHAL WEAPON''. SOME OF THE ACTION IS GOOD, BUT THE MOVIE'S JUST HARD TO SIT THROUGH. AT LEAST KEENEN IVORY WAYANS DOES DELIVER SOME FUNNY MOMENTS. WELL, SEAGAL HAS DONE WORSE MOVIES THAN THIS. BUT THEN AGAIN, SEAGAL HAS ALSO DONE BETTER MOVIES THAN THIS."
4,I like it a lot,"I bought the Jabra freespeak but, I did not like the ear gel thing sticking in my ear. I found the Bluetrek at Fry's electronics it looks similar to the Jabra device however, sounds a little better and is more comfortable on my ear.I have been using this headset with my T 68i and I am very pleased with the performance. I would recommend it for car use."
1,Not worth purchasing. Freinds say echo very irritating.,"Negative comments: Unit has bad static as if you are out of range at any distance past 5 feet. Freinds I call request that I not use it for the echo they her is very irritating to them. Headset is rather difficult to place on ear.Positive comments: Headset is comfortable to wear. The sound quality is good for the user as long as your phone is right next to you or on your belt.Additional comment: Echo is less if volume on headset is kept low, but still irritating."
4,"For the price, performance, a good deal","I love it... the only thing I did not like at first is the way it fits on the ear..but after a while u get use to it. Has a ton of functionality, and the battery last a long time! Very clear, my receivers can hear me fine..no different than my wired device... I did not like jabra because of the gel thingy.. feels funny! that's me!"
5,Absolutely stunning story.,"Gripping and provocative mystery of successful Maine shipping family during the late nineteenth century, Cameron's Landing focuses on Lorna, the new governess and amateur sleuth. Story is fast paced, engrossing, and moves to love story type ending for Lorna and Alex, the youngest Cameron heir. Cameron's Landing could be cited as Anne's best and is a must for faithful Anne Stuart fans. If you can't locate a copy, try the auctions."
5,Portable Tibetan Alters,"This alter book is great, I can take it with me put it up anywhere even in the woods to have my meditation anyplace I wish. Great on trips at home. Colorful and Unique, all that you need in one book. What a wonderful Idea, I highly recommend this to anyone just starting out or whatever. The pictures are wonderful. I use mine every chance I get. Highly recommended."
2,Sony ICD-SX57DR9 Digital Voice Recorder,"This model Sony comes either by itself for about $129, or $169 with docking station, recharable NiM batts.and Dragan Naturally ver. 9 speach to text SW. The Recorder is beutifully made, very small and records good quality Sony MSV files. However, both SW packages it comes with are a nightmare. I spent over 4 hours of personal time and an additioanl 1.5 hours with Sony technical support and NEVER got the Sony Digtial Voice SW to run properly. I tried it on two different Windows XP Computers. They do have a version for Vista now, you can download it from Sony (Ver. 3.1) However, neither 3.0 or 3.1 SW could run properly on my computers. I returned the unit in frustration. May try an Olympus, or just get a good o'l tape unit."
5,The tradition continues,"Picking up right where they left off, the memebers of hardfloor return with their follow up to electric crate digger. What can one say, this music hits the sweet spot between electrofunk, downbeat, house, and jazz... Not an easy task. The tone seems to be more contemplative on this outing, where we find more slow manuvers and breaks from the beat ridden landscape. Time must be taken to fully understand the complexity hidden in each gem of a track. I find that many people are attracted to several songs but fail to familiarize themselves with the entire album. In any case this is one cd everyone should own, regardless of their prejudices."
4,What a nice surprise!,"I'd never heard these guys, but bought this on the recommendation of Jack Rabid in The Big Takeover magazine... and it hasn't been far from my CD player for months! Great pop songs that bounce around in your head for days... I'd have given it five stars but had to take something off for the production- which is a little muddy. But I love it when I get adventurous and pick a CD I've never heard, and it turns out to be a winner! This is tons better than the junk on the radio nowadays. Great!"
3,anna nicole - media moneymaker,"ok but after a while you feel explotative watching this.i want item on anna nicole,and it may be that i know she's not profitting from this.I feel as though I should let her rest, as I'd want mine after passing.Another pretty face to be marketed and sold."
4,A Beautifully Photographed and Designed Book,"I've used this book as a reference on how to make clay tiles for roofing and flooring. It has other good tips on designing rooms, and information on making the furniture in the rooms. The furniture is way beyond my ability to make, but it's still a lovely book."
4,I really like this book.,"The photographs are beautiful, and the projects are lovely. I only wish they'd given more detailed instructions on some items, such as making flooring from clay."
3,too old for children,"I bought this for my granddaughters, ages 9 and7, and it was just too hard for them to make most items"
4,Winter insurrance!,"This charger features an Automatic On/Off, which will automatically shut off the charger to prevent overcharging and destroying a battery. It will charge a standard 12 volt battery in about 4-5 hours, or boost a battery to start your engine. It works with all types of 6 and 12 volt batteries. It is about $...-... less than buying it in discount automotive stores in the lower 48 States. (don't even ask what it costs up here in Alaska!)"
1,But who is that double???,"It remains an intriguing fact: the trip of Rudolf Hess to England. There were no indications that he was mad (at least not madder than the other nazi leaders) and all of a sudden he decides to fly to England to start the peace negotiations...The authors write a very stout book to investigate what happened or what could have happened. And that is my major problem with the book: on the basis of a number of very flimsy clues they draw far-reaching conclusions which they then present as the only possible truth in the rest of the book. They then use those conclusions as the basis for even more far-fetched conclusions etc.I also think that there is more to the flight of Hess than the ravings of a lunatic, but this book is a very easy way to come with a fantastic story. And the major conclusion (the person in Spandau prison was a double of the real Rudolf Hess who died in WW 2) is not supported by the evidence presented in this book."
4,Very good. Just one point amazed me...,"This ahrd-reading book is really THE FULL STORY OF THE VIETNAM WAR. IT's detailed and very well researched. The author had access to a lot pf previously unseen documents, due to the Freedom Of Information Act.But a detail amazed terrifically. In page 114, Morrison makes the following statement, about JFK murder:""Later that day, during a motorcade through the streets of Dallas, President Kennedy was assassinated by a professed communist and former United States Marine - Lee Harvey Oswald""I almost choked with desbilief. Does Morrison, such an accomplished and veteran writer, really believes in that? Does he really believe in the Warren COmission report that Oswald acted alone??!! I could not believe this. At least he could have written ""...was SUPPOSEDLY assassinated by..."""
5,Low price for a replacement snowblower spark plug.,I could not find this replacement spark plug at Walmart but I found out that Amazon.com has a lot of vendors with low prices on Spark plugs so I received this one and it works.
4,Really Good Western,"High quality DVD R with great image in Cinemascope aspect ratio.................this is an excellent noirish western............I really like MacMurray in this role.......he is believable as the grizzled gunfighter...also I like John Gavin, three years prior to Psycho. Recommended for Western fans."
4,Quantez on DVD-R,"Contrary to what one ""reviewer"" has written, Quantez is a fairly good Western although certainly no great classic. Most major Western enthusiasts will enjoy this movie.The DVD-R is quite good with stable images, good colour and considerable definition. Obviously the price of this DVD-R is quite high for a ""bare-bones"" disc with no ""extras"" but I'm glad I bought it. Fans of Westerns or Fred MacMurray will probably be pleased with this disc."
2,Something went wrong,"This was a slow and tedious western. MacMurray is not a hero for my taste. I expected more than long philosophical discussion what is good an evil. Too much talk. One pretty much knows how everything will turn out. The actors do their best, but the story is weak."
2,It is slow and feeble,"This is the opinion of Brian Garfield in his Western Films book. I saw this film lately in a VHS version, which was a factory, good quality tape, but I felt just like Garfield after seeing this film. Some talking styles irritate. MacMurray's way of talking is such one for me. It is about robbers which quarrel with each others. MacMurray will see his bad ways. I remind you that in IMDB many have liked this film. I do not know why. The actors are good, though, but the story is from B-films."
3,Outstanding account of dogfights over Guadalcananl,"This autobiography is well done, but there is too much detail about life after the first offensive of the United States during World War II. The descriptions of dog fights in an F4F against every kind of fighter plane the Japanese had in the Solomon Islands is the best I have ever read. Most engrossing, but the rest of the book lost me."
1,A Proud American not received,"I don't hate it, just haven't gotten the book, the first one sent was the wrong book, ordered it again and hasn't come"
4,"Most Complete Set Available, But...","Ronnie Milsap had 59 hits that reached the Top 40 of the Country charts between 1973 and 1993. Six of his hits also crossed over and hit the Top 40 of the Pop charts. This 2 CD set has forty of those hits, and is the most complete collection currently available. Unfortunately, the mastering of this set is not as good as the mastering of the single CD ""Ultimate Ronnie Milsap"". The ""Ultimate"" CD has better-defined bass and brighter highs--the ""Essential"" set is dull by comparison. If you need all forty songs, then ""Essential"" is truly that, but ""Ultimate"" is the better choice for the casual fan. For the true fanatic, get both."
4,good overview,"back in the day i always dug his voice and presentation and then growing up back in the day when i would flip the radio stations and hear what i wanted and also there was a time in a pre I-pod universe you had radio stations that played a balance of songs no matter what the style. hearing songs like Pure love and of course my cut ""there's no getting over me"" that is the cut and that groove is still bumping. i dig the honesty and directness in his music. country back in the day was on the real. you spoke to the heart and how you felt. Ronnie Milsap made songs you can still sing and remember."
5,Great item,This CD is a perfect choice if you want all the best of Ronnie Milsap.I dont think there is better choice out there for the 70's country music from one of the best artist to ever perform.
3,Still An Incomplete Ensemble Of Hits,"While The Essential Ronnie Milsap does a good job of spanning his RCA Records career, many of his cherished hits, such as ""Don't You Know How Much I Love You"", ""Turn That Radio On"" and ""In No Time At All"" are missing for some inexplicable reason. Therefore, this cannot qualify as the ultimate collection of Ronnie Milsap's Greatest Hits."
3,in the world of MP3 players who needs an Audio CD even if Ronnie,I love Ronnie and have loved his music for the last 30 years or more. CD's and audio cassettes are things of yesterday.My first question is why miss the digital clarity and compact carrying of Ipod/MP3 format?My second question is dont I need a medical check before paying this amount for an obsolete format recording?
3,diet difficult to follow,"i liked the workout routines and overall it is a good book, but the diet breakdown was quite confusing with all the different percentages that you needed to figure out. not a simple plan."
2,Not for the uninitiated,"I am currently taking an undergraduate course on Cather, and I hoped that this book would provide some insight into a side of her not covered in the course. However, I found the book full of jargon which rendered it incomprehensible to me. Perhaps if you are already initiated into the world of ""queer studies"" you will find it interesting, but I don't recommend it for a casual reader."
5,night stalkers,"great book, I dont usually get into books but this one really keeps me interested. I cant wait for the next one."
3,Collected Works from a real genius,"While not for everyone, this is a great book about a very important early aerodynamicist who's work still affects the world. The book is the fifth volume of a five volume set covering Von Karman's professional life. This volume covers the last period in the series. Theodore Von Karman passed away in May 1963.I read this book early in my career from the library where I worked. I thought it was a great book then and have remembered it's pages since. On a wild hair I thought I would finally see if it was available on the Internet. Sure enough I saw one copy available at one used bookstore. I also saw it available through Amazon.com for the same price from the same bookstore. I decided to go through Amazon.com. I may have bought the last one available, even on the Internet.When the book arrived, I found it was a numbered member of the first publishing. Thus it was a real find."
4,Not very durable,"Good light tube. It lasted about two months, then it simply exploded when I was inflating it. Otherwise it handled really well single XC tracks, including roots, rocks etc. while it was new."
5,Illuminating the Word,Excellent book depicting the making of the St. John's Bible. The pictures and illustrations are wonderful. It clearly brings back the experience of seeing the Bible display in person.
5,please list the titles of the 25 vol. of set,"I am interested in the 25 vol. set, but want to know the title and vol. number of each. Also the type of binding and how many publications this is for it,as well as the publisher, and address of publisher."
4,AC 40482 Fuel Pump,The pump looks fantastic except for one detail. There are no AC logos cast into the top of the pump as on the original pumps.
2,Not as great as I anticipated.,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, mostly because of the great reviews it had gotten. Out of the 6 or so bottles we've opened in the last couple weeks, the cork has gone into the bottle at least 4 times...not the best result. I have owned a similar corkscrew in the past, so, I thought I knew how to use this one. This one is MUCH more difficult to use. It was less money, but, I wish I'd bought the other brand."
2,so-so magnifier,"The lens has circular lines running through it and the switch is somewhat hard to move. The magnifier is usable, but considering the price I would not purchase it."
3,this is good stuff,i was unfamiliar with wishbone ash - although much of the hippy-blues rock music of this era fills my collection - so i snared this disc recently - and i'm pleased - these guys played their music because they loved it - they were obviously unconcerned with the critics of their time or with 'making the radio' - they just love the music - and you can get that 'feel' as you listen - the 'muse' plays within them - this is good music - if you like music played simply for the sake of the music (not the 'almighty dollar' or to 'hit the charts') then buy this - if you want catchy music with little jingles you can whistle while you're at work - then why are you at a wishbone ash page?space puppy out
5,A Must Have for guitarists!,"This is by far a guitar aficionado's wet dream. Lovely interludes followed by rocking lead solos that rival any of today's so-called guitar gods best work. Buy it, you won't be sorry."
2,Progressive?,"This a so-so rock album with so-so melodies and not bad harmonies in the voice department but i would not call this progressive (nor a 'masterpiece').Closer to heavy metal bands to come in it's simplicity than anything else. No odd time metered compositions, no experimentation to challenge you, no real idiosyncratic style, no RIO, Canterbury, symphonic or fusion influence...so why call this group prog? beats me."
3,very good hippy music,i was unfamiliar with wishbone ash - although much of the hippy-blues rock music of this era fills my collection - so i snared this disc recently - and i'm pleased - these guys played their music because they loved it - they were obviously unconcerned with the critics of their time or with 'making the radio' - they just love the music - and you can get that 'feel' as you listen - the 'muse' plays within them - this is good music - if you like music played simply for the sake of the music (not the 'almighty dollar' or to 'hit the charts') then buy this - if you want catchy music with little jingles you can whistle while you're at work - then why are you at a wishbone ash page?space puppy out
3,Folk-rock band adopt Argus/Tarkus imagery,"Wishbone Ash were superlative exponents of British skiffle-boogie. Redolent with medieval imagery and Arthurian swords-and-sorcery song-titles -- 'The King Will Come', 'Warrior' and 'Throw Down the Sword' etc -- this was not an album on which the group would betray their folk and hard rock influences. Tracks like 'Leaf and Stream' went on to influence countless bands such as the Doobie Brothers (for example, 'I Cheat the Hangman' on STAMPEDE).There are some superbly arranged set pieces here, particularly 'The King Will Come'. 'Argus' stands on its own as a strange blend of duelling guitars, occasional Fairport-like harmonies and Tennyson sentiments.It's not my favourite Wishbone album -- I feel 'There's the Rub' is desperately underrated -- but it's good for the occasional listen."
1,In the minority on this one,"Yes it was a 'nice gesture' that the original bassist turned obscure studio mogul, decided to add a little extra with the lengthy live trax from the bone's 72 radio broadcast from Memphis Tn. But how many more times are these songs going to be run into the ground-its as if no other Bone songs exist but!The spiritual message of 'The King Will Come' is still intriguing but has been played better in concert esp with the twin city madness of Laurie and Andy and for the matter in the 90's with ROGER FILGATE and Andy! The production on this album, of the 4 with original guitarist TED TURNER, still is way TOO layed back compared to such dynamo trax on the other 3 records-'Queen of Torture', 'Vas Dis'(The Brother Jack McDuff Gem), 'So Many Things To Say' 'Blind Eye' 'The Pilgrim' etc.This is THE CAREER album of the early days, and those who know the band, well its their MOST favorite, so why should I spoil the fun...for me, these songs on 'Argus' are just not up to snuff."
5,Masterful remaster,"I've had 2 vinyl copies in the last 25 years and the current one has held up well. I resisted an earlier CD because I could not reconcile having 'No Easy Road' as a bonus track as I felt it hampered the concept of Argus. The crisp clear guitars, driving bass and sharp drums on this remastered CD really demonstrates the poor quality of the original vinyl although I never noticed this before.The three 'Live from Memphis' cuts are raw and exciting and complement the main album. My original album cover does have something that the CD cover does not-the flying saucer. This is strange because they reference the fs in the CD booklet.Wishbone Ash still tours extensively and returns to the U.S. February 2004."
5,Best Green Mole Sauce Mix ever,"Tradiciones Green Mole Sauce Mix is, without a doubt, the best pre-packaged mole I have ever found. The flavor is fantastic and it could pass for homemade. I always keep it stocked in my cupboard."
3,"Great, but not with Ocular Docking System","The Smith Turbo Fan goggles are great at keeping fogging at bay. But those of us who wear eyeglasses should wear glasses and use the OTG goggles. Smith's Ocular Docking System (ODS) is a disaster -- do not buy it. It is very difficult to put the adaptor on the goggle, and the lens bracket keeps falling out of the adaptor. Incredibly poor design, and you'll be sorely disppointed if you spend the extra dough on the ODS. Wear glasses beneath the OTG goggle and don't fall for the wasted expense and headache of the ODS. You'll be cussing Smith for the ODS design!"
4,How stunning is Tropical Macrolife!,"What is interesting in this book is what I did not expect as well: authors explicitly chose to focus just on macrolife, i. e. on small living beings to be found in Malaysian shallow waters. As a consequence, you will not find photos on large fishes and amazing shells, but an endless carousel of stunning photographs regarding nudibranchs, shrimps, small fishes, and so on. In my view, this makes this book even more interesting - and I must also mention how technically hard must be to take some of these shots! The books is also entertaining to read and scientifically correct, therefore I wish to suggest it to passionate divers!Federico"
3,Content excellent binding terrible,"The images in this book are excellent. They surpass those found in Debelius ""Indian Ocean Reef Guide"". The descriptions and notes are also excellent. For content I give this book 5-stars.The construction of this very expensive book is terrible. I am professional diver and know many people with this book and all have the same complaint. The binding of this book is awful and cheap. The book - both the hard and soft cover editions falls apart practically after the first viewing. On the one hand this is a book that I want to take with me when I travel and on the other hand it can't stand up to the rigors of sitting on a book shelf let alone actually using it.I ask the publish to have some self respect and find a way to contract for a binding worth the price of this book."
2,"ugly, but the price was right.","I'll probably never wear it, maybe for fishing possibly. It was like 13 bucks though so how could I go wrong."
4,Love it!,"We are making these as I type! The masks are large (3-4oz), but worth it. They look fantastic! We give them to various performers in community theatre as show gifts.The trick/secret to getting them to come out easily is to put the molds in the freezer to set up. You will know they are ready when the chocolate starts to pull away from the mold.One note to remember; use the ""cookie sticks"" for the masks. They are much larger and can handle the weight."
1,Century 87151 Taiwan piece of junk,"Century 87151 Taiwan piece of junk, spade terms inside are so loose, the wires fell off, heat sink on power transistor so loose it rattles."
1,These are crap.,"The don't work at all. The frosting stuck to them and even where they left a mark, it was too SMALL to go over with a normal frosting tubing. Lame, would not bother to purchase or use these again."
5,Wilton Press Set,Exactly as described and works great. I bought this as a gift and I am very happy with and would recommend this to a friend
3,Mentaly Stimulating...But ...,"This book is amazing from the point of view of WHY the gituar tune-ing is so unique, BUT if you want to learn and are just starting out this may not be the best choice. This book approaches the gituar from a whole diffrent stand point; and it will not help you to interface your playing with other musicians as the book dose not show you how to really to apply this approach to standrd modes scales ect {how to use it in every day situations.... jamming ect }..you have to buy another book...volume 3!!! more money to spend! Its good to know this stuff but I would think only after you have masterd stanardtheory first...as thay say it explains WHY the gituar is unique but how do you apply that diffrence is lacking...and to me that would be the real reason to learn all this stuff.Mentally stimulating though. No question about that..."
1,Very tough for a complete novice,"As I v'e read in other reviews, this book goes from major open string chords straight to barre chords which at this stage in the game I am not capable of doing. I like the logic presented here and will come back to this book once I've developed more hand strength and basic skills."
1,There is no shortcuts in music!,"I started playing guitar in the 70's when there was no internet etc. Wanna play guitar? Buy a songbook with chord diagrams and learn simple basic music theory.I bought this book along with Guitar fretboard workbook because I was still looking for the ""magic bullet"" to break down this mental block I have on lead guitar. Well! What a waste of money! If you think you were confused before wait till you try this system!Don't believe the reviews. I would like to see or hear these so called people who rave about this book.You can't cheat the system, and you won't find no smoking gun or magic bullet in this book. Basic music theory is the answer!"
2,Too much knowledge is assumed,"Perhaps I just don't have the mental faculties for this book, but I am now looking for a very elementary music theory book so that one day Fret Logic might make sense. The author tells the reader not to go to part 2 until part 1 is mastered, which means I will probably never make it to part 2. I feel like I need a lot more knowlege for this book to make much sense."
2,Tons of better books out there,"This book might be interesting to someone who is picking up a guitar for the first time, but it is not helpful if you have been playing for a while. You won't learn anything new, and the terminology will confuse you. I would take all of the rave reviews you see of this book with a grain of salt. If you want to play rock, try any of the books by (...)."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY GUITAR!,First let me say this he takes some stabs a Mel Bay books but the thing is Mel Bay books teach you how to READ MUSIC. I wasted weeks reading this book and its cryptic if you ask me.You can learn the notes on the fretboard way faster if you know all your octaves IMHO. This book is a waste of good paper.
2,for beginners only,"I bought this book hoping to get some more insight into soloing and solo theory, however this book is very formulaic. The material is geared toward those who don't know music theory and don't want to learn. It takes that approach that theory is unimportant to guitar players. As a musician for over 10 years I can say that that is completely untrue.I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone who wants to be a serious musician. Learning your scales and the chords that they go with is like learning your multiplication tables, it is something that you just have to do."
2,Limited practical usefullness,"I've been playing guitar for 7 years now and I've bought this book some years ago, thinking it would make me master my guitar, based on other reviews I've seen. Well... it has not.It teaches you a myriad of fingering patterns to play chords, scales, arpegios and scale runs, without needing to know the single notes on you fretboard. And that's also the problem: there are too much patterns! I remember that I worked my way to the 3/4th of the book, then... well I lost interest. Now I've almost forgotten them all...[...]And in fact learning the notes on the fretboard and learning the notes in the most common scales (and chords) is less overhead and more usefull than learning all these patterns.So, you understood it, today I very rarely refer to this book anymore"
5,Very impressed and very pleased.,"I've had this book for several years and still find myself going back to it as my ultimate reference. Before I had purchased it I had been playing guitar for about 12 years. I was tired of playing other people's music and tired of playing rhythm. So one day I walked into my local guitar shop and asked an associate ""can you recommend a book for a guy like me who wants to start soloing and know his way around the fretboard better""? He pointed me to Fretboard Logic. I bought it and jumped right in.Wow! The guy who came up with this technique is a genius. I found it really easy to understand the whole CAGED sequence and it really helped me to better navigate the fretboard during improv sessions. Now I am much more confident whenever writing, jamming and improvising with other artists.I highly recommend this to any player who is familiar with rhythm guitar, knows the basic chords and wants to further their playing."
5,Finally someone made sense of the guitar tuning/fretboard,"I only regret I didn't run across this book a decade or two ago.I bought multiple scale books and they all boil down to the usual ""dots-on-the-fretboard"" kind of thing, with the more adventurous throwing in some greek names for erudition.None ever said why or how they fit together!!!Finally Bill Edwards unlocked the mistery with his books. I have only read Volume I so far, but I know I will re-read both volumes over and over.I can finally traverse the whole fingerboard without going out of scale, which is what I wanted to do all along and nobody could tell me. With Edwards' method I can visualize and understand what I am doing, and project where I want to go.Nobody ever did that for me. Long live Bill Ewards!"
1,The Most Useless Guitar Book I Ever Read,"Author relies on unconventional scale forms as the central part of his system. That's the problem as it is with most ""miracle"" systems. Anyone starting out on this author's method should understand that this system will put you automatically at odds with how the everybody else plays music.Save your money."
4,Great book,The first part was very easy to understand. The second... I had some questions on the patterns in relation to the modes and the target notes. He would show the pattern beyond the target note but state only play from and to the target note. The lead patterns became very confusing to me at this point. I ended up purchasing Troy Stetina's book on scales and was able to figure it out from there. All in all it was just a few details that threw me. I would still purchase it again. The book is still excellent.
1,The Speed Reading Method for Learning Guitar,"And as Woody Allen said, ""I took a speed-reading course and read 'War and Peace' in 20 minutes. It involves Russia.""This book is fine if you want to play alone or with the very small percentage of *guitarists* who've adopted Edward's method. In terms of learning a language that will help you to interact with other musicians, his nomenclature might as well be Latin.For better results, get Ed Roseman's ""Music Theory for Practical People"" and pony up for a few lessons."
5,Having trouble? Here's your answer...,"I've been playing for 15 years. Thats a long time to not really know anything about my instrument. Well, the Major and natural minor scales, pentatonics, and a few positional arpeggios, but its sad how little I know about the Fretboard.Enter this book. It takes the guitar, sectiosn it off in bite-sized chunks and then reassembles the whole thing into a tastier morsel. It views things in terms of 5 movable chords. There are scales and arpeggios associated with these scales. Learn them. Then it tells shows you how they are connected.This is not a lesson book. It just gives you some patterns and suggeswted fingerings for the major scale, its modes, harmonic minor, melodic minor, chords and arpeggios. Its good if you feel like you were weak in this department and it opened up doors for me again.I'm very glad I got it."
3,to much info not not a lot practical application in 1-2or 3,good for caged patterns but other than that itd a good refrance book alittle to much info for just learning for the first time. book 3 is more like a novel.
3,A simple concept with whole lot of fluff,"Seems to be a simple and logical concept, but it's accompanied by tediously long and unnecessary text."
3,This fretboard is not logical,"I got this book on a recommendation, and dove right in, determined to master whatever it was that I was supposed to learn. The idea of splitting apart chord shapes and their musical counterparts is a good one for helping to simplify the guitar learning process.However, the book fails to point out that if you just blindly make the chord shapes and strum every string (which the book instructs you to do), you will be creating disharmonic chords that sound like crap. I am not a musician, but after several days of following the instructions I started feeling like something was seriously wrong. Upon showing my book to a musician I know, he confirmed that it is simply wrong. Yes, technically any combination of notes is a chord, but playing the 5th and 6th strings for several of the 'chord shapes' is wrong and this book fails to point that out. Which seems to me like a severe oversight. I stopped using it after that."
2,I wasn't impressed,"This book does describe the logical patterns of the C-A-G-E-D sequence. Seeing how these patterns interconnect may be enlightening, but, it's not the revolutionary way of thinking the author would lead you to believe. One dissapointing thing is that the pentatonic scale is the basis for this book and when you try to adapt it to other scale forms it becomes less apparent and falls apart completely with some scale shapes. When the book eventually begins to discuss modes (which it tries hard to avoid in the first two sections) it glazes over them and doesn't convey any real information. It focuses on scale forms yet the actual underlying scale goes by a different name - confusing. You may find this book enlightening to a degree, but it won't revolutionize your playing or the way you look at the guitar. If you're looking for a good fretboard / music theory book for the guitar, this book will only get you so far."
4,Fretboard Logic,"The book arrived within the time it was supposed to, in great condition. I looks to be a wonderful source of knowledge about the why's and wherefore's of guitar scales methods. Finally a one-stop source!"
5,Fretboard Logic SE,These two books can make sense of a lot of information that is typically given as separate pieces. Good instructors integrate concepts for their students and make the puzzle of separate lessons into a picture that becomes music. The students that have been frustrated by having lots of lessons that they struggled to integrate will be well served in purchasing this series of studies.
2,So-so,"Not a bad guide to the underlying logic of the guitar fretboard. Very thorough, too. But if you want an easier, more concise, and practical guide (that I use as a performing musician and guitar instructor) that shows more concrete examples, try Fred Sokolow's Guitar Fretboard Road Maps. Edward's book is more useful for the intermediate guitarist (and beyond) who wants to deepen his understanding of the instrument (it won't improve your playing - Sokolow's will)."
5,Every Guitar Player Must Have,"This is the book to have if you play guitar. I am a guitar teacher and this book transforms the guitar into something perfectly logical and simple. If you are confused by the fretboard and how chords/scales/improv fit together you need this book! The CAGED sequence presented is so incredibly helpful for soloing. Just get this book ok? I have tried a ton of other books, but this book I continually have open and use. I could write more, but it basically comes down to this, I love this book and use it non-stop. I recommend it to all my guitar friends."
5,Finally something CLICKED,"I think this book is great. I've come close to given up on learning the guitar after attempting it for so long and only being able to read tabs. Its very simply written so you have to go over it a lot, but the concepts are great. Its like finally something has clicked. The author brought a lot of insight on how to play and how the fretboard is organized. What an epiphany that there is a method to the madness!I definitely think this is a must, just wish I would I would of studied this sooner when I started..."
1,Don't Buy,I have received two of the units from Target. Both arrived empty. Amazon was very good about giving me a full refund.
5,DeShazer,DeShazer was one of the Tokyo Raiders that bombed Japan after taking off of the USS Hornet in 1942. His crew was captured by the Japanese and during the time he was in prison he was given a Bible after which the Lord really changed his life. A great story about how God can work in unusual circumstances to save a person.
1,Mine is no longer charging,I bought mine April 2001. It is no longer able to charge back up to power. It did work the first few months but now it is gone. It is interesting to see that I am not alone.
1,Died in less than 2 years.,"I hardly used it at all. Kept it charged & stored as instructed.Used it as backup battery on pop-up camper if main battery died.AC Adaptor died I think, no replacement available for 15VDC AC Adaptor.Try another model, not Century!!!"
1,fire hazzard,"I had one of these (j900) in my trunk which apparently bounced against the sidewall, knocked the leads loose, they arced together and started my trunk carpet on fire. The century mfg. co. won't return my calls, so I am trying to alert people to the potential disaster these products are."
3,three star,"this product is ok. it came with all the things it was suppose to come with. With much practice and 7 months laters i have found that this is a difficult guitar to learn on. I still like playing on it, but i now have and electric guitar and amp. my electric guitar was easier to start playing on than the acoustic. the strings are harder to press than my electric guitar. And if your just a begginer i suggest geting a KORG tuner b/c the strings on the guitar do not come in tuned, instead they are very loosened to prevent the strings from breaking during shipping. I reccomend you go to your local music store and try acoustic gutiars there first."
1,Not good at all,the receipt of the guitar was great it would have been better had I actually received what i ordered the guitar is not packaged correctly and there are dings all over now I have to send back and will lose my 15 dollar shipping fee plus spend another fee to send back. I would not recommend this seller to anyone not even for a 1st guitar it appears to be cheaply made
5,Concise Meditations and Yoga Practice,"Jon Kabat-Zinn guides two sets of guided meditations and two days of yoga practice in a clear concise, soothing tones. Forty five minutes seem to zip by quickly while doing the daily routines. I have recommended this program to many people since I began the series just weeks ago. I'm very happy with the results thus far and plan to use this program for years to come."
5,Very Helpful for Pain Management!,Well done. Has been very helpful with pain management clients. Would recommend it highly and without any reservation. Thank you!
4,Very helpful,"I became familiar with Kabot-Zinn's mediation series through some classes I participated in. I have used his mediations to bring peace to my inner spirit in times of crisis or at times when I just needed to slow down. His methods truly help me to fully relax, and I thought that was impossible. I recommend that you give it a try!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I know that Jon Kabat-Zinn has a tremendous amount of knowledge to share however it did not come through for me in this CD collection. The pacing of the movement sequences is very slow and the voice quality is somewhat distracting. Based on the title of the CD's I was under the impression that there would be more information about meditation techniques, however the majority of the information presented is a very gentle guided yoga practice. Somewhat disappointing."
1,Needed professional speaking voices for meditations,"I was very disappointed with the CDs because the voices are very ""nasal"" sounding. I have several guided meditation CDs and they are done by people who obviously have taken some form of vocal training.If I could, I would return the product. These doctors may know their stuff but should have professionals record it."
1,Annoying & useless,"I have taken a class based on Jon Kabat-Zinn's mindfulness meditation. The instructor had made a tape similar to this one - it was wonderful. Unfortunately the old tape broke, so I ordered this CD. The voice, whose-ever it is (hopefully not Zinn's), is so annoying and it is way too wordy. There are so many superfluous words that mean nothing - the guided body meditation is completely lost. There needs to be precise guidance and pauses where nothing is said. As it is it's useless."
1,Very annoying voice/incorrect focus,"I can only agree with the other negative reviews regarding Kabat-Zinn's voice. When I listen to a mindfulness tape I don't want to be thinking about the reader's saliva or lack of. I cannot listen to these CDs now due to his voice. There are actually free guided meditations and body scans online that are much better.It is also a GREAT disappointment that he mentions relaxation as a goal of e.g. body scanning which is wrong, wrong, wrong. It is not a goal with mindfulness which he is very well aware of so I cannot understand why he would say in the beginning that we do the body scan to dwell in a deep state of relaxation.Huh?That is not the purpose of mindfulness/meditation/body scanning/yoga and if that is your goal then you are doomed to failure.Otherwise I love Kabat-Zinn and his work, but I am baffled by these CDs."
3,"be careful, it is not really complete!","I recently bought ""Guided Mindfulness Meditation - a complete mindfulness meditation program from Jon Kabat-Zinn"".What is meant by complete??There are 3 cd's and a small booklet. Cd 1 is alright, you can practice the exercises at home, no problem whatsoever.But cd 2 and 3 contain yoga exercises and in the booklet it is written: the postures for both yoga cds are outlined in Full Catastrophe Living (which is another book, sold seperately). Can you imagine that I feel disappointed? Why not tell this in advance, clearly and honestly? It is NOT complete and I feel tricked, honestly speaking."
3,Great Meditation CD,"I bought this CD for a Stress Reduction class and it does it's job quite well. Kabat-Zinn narrates through a 40-minute body scan, two 40-minute yoga exercises, and a sitting meditation in this series alone (you can purchase other series for more exercises). If done properly, all exercises are helpful in understanding the body, relaxation, beginning yoga, and mindfulness, but Kabat-Zinn's voice can wear on the nerves after a while. His voice isn't exactly what I would call ""soothing,"" and he has an annoying tendency to smack. But mindfulness is all about letting go of little things and learning acceptance, so maybe there is something to be said about learning to ignore the minor things that can cause annoyance on this c.d. Also, there is no accompanying music, so if you need a good soothing soundtrack for your meditation you might want to look elsewhere. Overall a good choice for beginners."
5,"Fascinating introduction to RDF, OWL, Web Services","I'm not usually a fan of ""explorer's guides"", but this book is different. Technical books either cover how things are done, or why they are done. Most often it's about the 'how', and explorer's books just spread a thinner 'how to' over lots of topics. The value of this book is in the perspective it provides, the 'why', as opposed to just a 'how to'.It covers both how and why for RDF, OWL, Web Services, Agents and a number of other topics. And gives you a complete perspective for the entire field. Of course, what you don't get is a complete how-to guide on any one of these topics. Which is fine by me.I recommend this book for anyone who knows nothing about these technologies, but wants a perspective on the entire field. That's not something you are going to find in reference books on each of these individual subjects. Not that I have been able to find a good book on RDF."
3,Good for the most part.,"Our family enjoyed watching this DVD, except for the way they ended it. Everything was going along ok until the last candy factory. It was suckers with real insects inside. Repulsive! We haven't wanted to watch it again. I guess you could say it left a bad taste in our mouths for the entire DVD."
3,It's only ONE car,"I guess I should have read the information more closely, I thought I was getting three wooden cars for this price, turns out it's only ONE. It's a cute car, works, and hopefully will last, but it's only ONE! Overpriced. Big time."
5,Keeping Foods Fresh,No kitchen should be without this book. My most used reference in the kitchen. Knowing how to store produce to maximize its life keeps down the waste. The book is well organized with a good index and is very easy to use.
3,OKO Italtrike Tricycle: OVERPRICED!,The locking handle for the parent to steer doe not lock and the trike is constantly heading off to one side. I will have to lift and move the trike back to the center of the road to continue on. It made for a miserable ride. The sun shade also does not stay up. The attachment holding the shade is very flimsy and the shade kept leaning to one side and so I ended up removing it because it looked stupid. My son is almost 4 and does love the bike because he has always been short and this is the only trike that his feet reach and he is able to peddle on his own. It is way overpriced though (maybe worth $50)!
2,Made in China,"I had to throw away the canopy since it was tiny and flimsy and got bent out of shape so it was practically providing no cover when listing to one side. Seat pad came off and I had reattach it with double-sided tape. I was never able to tighten the push bar so it would not twist around in its socket. Otherwise the trike seems sturdy.Despite what the description says, it's made in China, not Italy. It is somewhat heavy to move around and does not fit in the trunk of our car without major disassembly. And my son does not like using it so for all these reasons, I would not buy this product again."
2,Dental water additive,I will not be using this any more even though recommended by my vet. It is expensive with the number of dogs I have and I am not sure that it is doing anything. I also am concerned about the xylitol that it has in the solution regarding my pets health.
5,Formative factors in Masters' creative genius,"This frank verbal self-portrait reveals the forming of the epitaphal poet. His early years are seen against the backdrop of his midwestern roots, his law training, and emergent writing. Particularly of interest are his anecdotes of life in the Chicago of Clarence Darrow, the White City, and his romantic ventures. The text gives insight into what formed the voices of Spoon River Anthology. It's haunting, wistful and funny. Tender nostalgia, particularly for Illinoisans."
3,boring,"I have both Across Spoon River and Spoon River Anthology.Across Spoon River is boring. Masters goes off a great deal to tell about his numerous family members. I had lost track of them very soon.On the other hand, Spoon River Anthology is interesting and dynamic. It is a masterpiece actually. When I first checked out the book from a library, I only read one poem per day to prolong the pleasure.By the way, reading Masters' poems, I've noticed many logical expressions.In programming terms, some of the poems contain while, for loops, switch, and if else statements.Awesome discovery."
1,Typical left-wing claptrap of the 90's put into song,"If one understands the world totally black and white, i.e. one thinks that ""BHO is the opposite of GWB"", then one might catch the drift of the Folk Heroes' lyrics. Otherwise, it's a pinko-commie propaganda for the gullible. The singing is against everything and anything ""Conservative"": churches and Christianity - of course!, against Pat Buchanan, against conservative girlfriend, against.... oh, you get the picture. Liberal gooood! Conservative baaaad!Offered for a penny per CD, but not worth even that. Worthless."
4,good to have this book BUT,"Huidobro--I discovered him back in the 1970s with a bilingual editon of Poemas árticos. I am currently using the Spanish and French texts--with occasional cross-reference to the English--as an aid in a translation of the poems into Hebrew for the Israeli reading public. As I read these poems in the Spanish and French I glance too at the English and note that many of the English translation choices are imprecise or simply wrong--sometimes reflicting a misjudgment of the grammar of the original languages. More careful editing would have prevented this. HOWEVER, the editors and translators have done a service in bringing his poems to the Anglophone public and for that they deserve our praise--"
5,Excellent for teaching older (and some younger) children,"Extremely helpful resource for teaching my children history. Our children are 13, 12 and 8, and I used the discussion questions pretty much straight out of the book for the older two. For the younger one, I wrote fewer, more concrete questions (such as, ""how old was [so and so] when he moved to [wherever]). Other than that, the most useful feature of the Guide was the list of extra readings and resources for each lesson. The one downside with this Guide, and true of the others as well, is the lack of scheduling help (how many lessons per week, how to group them, and so on). I found some great help on the Greenleaf Website. The editor, Rob Shearer, posts the scheduling of his own classes. Take a peak at his Ancient Civilization schedule yourself ...."
1,A Big Disapointment,"This book is a big disapointment. The begining chapters have some useful information, but much of it can easily be found on the web. The 220 franchises they list have no supporting information on why they're the best. The information they provide seem like condensed versions of the franchisor's flyers."
2,Disappointing,My problem with the book is that the characters are drawn to look like the actors in the A&E production of Pride and Prejudice who did not always resemble the characters as described in the book. I found it disappointing.
3,Used and abused.,I received this lens open with finger prints when purchased new. Nothing on this filter or case indicates L-39 Sharp Cut. This is a standard UV filter made by Canon. Works as designed.
3,2 year shelf life...,"Bought the filter 2 years ago, not for UV protection, but more for lens protection. I don't use this particular lens all that often, but on my last trip to Bali, the range in temperatures and humidity caused a haze on the lens that I haven't been able to clean (which I find ironic, since it's called a ""haze"" filter). For $30, I didn't feel like I got my money's worth, and based on the reviews, I am now switching to Hoya."
2,Marginal Quality,"This is an OK mid-quality filter. However, it will most likely somewhat degrade the quality of your picture. If you have a bargin lens, this is probably a good choice for a protection filter. However, if you have chosen a good quality lens, then this filter will most likely disappoint you with the quality of the pictures you take. A better choice is Hoya's professional line."
2,Apparently used,"I bought this filter to use it with a Canon EF-S 10-22mm. Unfortunately the filter touches the front element of the lens at 10mm. I corrected this problem by adding a spacer between the filter an the lens but one would assume that being a Canon filter, it would fit their entire lens line. I'll be replacing this filter as soon as I can. Aside from this first inconvenience, the filter came with fingerprints and minor scratches. I was not aware that this filter was used when I bought it and it was not advertised this way. Amazon should double check what's being advertised as new and make sure it is."
2,Poor design/quality,"Expected Canon quality, but received the Canon 77mm filter with loose glass and poor threading; the filter almost permanently stuck to the lens produced by Canon (17-55mm f/2.8 IS). Needless to say, I returned this item and got the higher-quality Hoya 77mm filter instead, though the cost is 2x."
2,Disappointed,Package seems it has been used.Some scratches on the front that even influence the lens...Been fooled by the name Canon
5,Excellent protection for very few dollars,"With the price of new lenses going up all the time, it's in your best interest to spend a few more bucks to protect them. UV haze filters do a great job for very few extra dollars. I have them on both of my new Canon L lenses. They were put on as soon as I took them out of the box. With 25 years of professional photography experience under my belt, I highly recommend this product."
2,Packaging didn't survive shipping,"The lens arrived already opened and the lens was loose. Amazingly, there was no damage to the lens, but filters shouldn't arrive bouncing around."
4,Smart Investment,A must for your lens to protect the front glass. Better than the standard cheap filters.
3,Not good for Aviation Spotting.,"I have a Canon 100-400L IS and this filter works good but I use this lens mostly for Aviation Spotting and the problem that I have is that when any light from the airplane like the landing gear lights are on, I'll get some very nasty reflections so I don't recommend this for this particular activity."
2,flare problems,I found that this filter causes flare and sometimes there are reflections of light as streaks or spots on my pictures because of the filter. Though it is true that it provides great protection i would suggest another filter if you don't want that chance of flare.Id go for multi resistance coating like B+W 77mm MRC(010)or to save some money maybe a tiffen
1,Just a chunk of glass,This is the worse filter I have ever used. It is not coated with the light reflects and refracts so easily. Not suitalbe for use as anything except as a coaster.
1,1 lost and 2 bad from shipping,"I bought a canon lens and the a 77mm lens cover at the same time. The lens is perfect but there was no lens cover in the lens cover package. So they said they would ship me another one with next day shipping which was nice. But the package the lens cover was in was opened, probably during shipping and got scratched and destroyed. So they shipped me another one with next day shipping. The third had the same problem has the second one but this one had some marking like finger prints on it. I simply got a refund now and have to ship three boxes back to them. The problem is the lens package only is held together by one little plastic clip and throwing a little bubble wrap on top of it doesn't protect it from shipping when the box could probably hold 30 of them."
1,"Received it scratched, out of box!",I received the filter and it was outside of its packaging and scratched. I haven't even bothered trying it. They had better give me my money back is all I can say!
1,Not What is Advertised,I ordered this for a wide angle lens. When I received it it was not an L-39 Sharp Cut filter. It was a regular UV Haze filter. I returned it and the replacement was the same thing. If you need a filter for a wide angle lens this is not it.
1,Filter,I'm very disappointed in the quality of this filter. I recieved it scratched and it has a film on it that I cannot remove. This filter cost close to $40.00 and had I seen it before buying I won't have wasted my time or money on it.
2,Poor construction,"The intent of this filter is largely to protect and preserve the front optic on my Canon EF 70-200 f/2.8L IS USM lens. Sadly, it's not up to the task. The inner metal ring that retains the glass in the filter warped and eventually allowed the glass to completely fall out. Granted, this filter was bought back in the 2003-2004 timeframe, so it's a few years old. However, I've never seen this kind of failure on any other filters...some of which are much older. Perhaps they've redesigned the product since then. I'll post two photos to show what happened."
5,Nice and clear.,Like many other Canon products I have owned in the past this one lives up to its name. You dont even notice that you have a filter on. The main reason I have always used the UV filters was mainly to protect the main lense. You do notice in hazy weather it does help.
2,I returned it,"The low price and a Canon name were the reason I bought this filter. However, this is the heaviest 77 mm filter with thickest frame I have ever seen. The copy I received had a thin layer of dirt and looked very dirty. I tried every way I could to clean it but failed so I returned it. Regardless the dirt (perhaps the copy I received was used?), I don't like it simply because of the weight and the thick frame. I bought a Sigma DG (multi-coated) for my Canon EF 17-40mm L lens and a B+W (not multi-coated) for my Canon EF 24-105mm L lens. I paid a little more for the Sigma and B+W but they are much better built."
2,uv haze filter 77mm,Package had been opened and handled before being shipped..was not in the cleanest of conditions...made me wish I had purchased from a different provider.
5,Does what you want,"I'm sure there are those who'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is ""much better"" than another, but for my Canon EF-S 10-22mm on a 20D, I figure Canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they're willing to have branded ""Canon."" It fits fine, doesn't interfere with the lens hood, looks clear, seems to attenuate that nasty ultra-violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all, protects the front element. What more would one want?"
2,Doesnt do anything but add glare and hazing to your pictures,"I wouldnt recommend this UV Haze filter for anyone unless you need basic protection for your lens if you are traveling in the sahara or something. In normal conditions the filter actually makes picture look less saturated and stale, and also can add a glare to the picture. Would be better to get a polarizer or some other type of filter than this one."
2,Seemingly used filter sent to me,"Commenting more on the condition of the filter when I received it than the filter itself, but I ordered this filter with a new lens. It arrived loose in its packaging, had fingerprints on it, and was scrached. Very disappointed that this item was shipped to me. Maybe people handling the item don't realize what photographers expect, and the Canon packaging is just no good. I suspect the thickness of this filter would also cause vignetting on a full frame camera with any wide-angle lens. Returned for refund. On the good side, image quality through the filter seems crisp, and little vignetting on a 20D sensor, so suspect a truly new version would be fine on longer lenses. Keep in mind that this is a slightly tinted filter, (UV/Haze) not just a clear UV."
1,USED,This was the first time that I purchased a used book that was not worth buying. There was pen marks all over the book that you couldn't even enjoy it. I was disappointed because I have purchased many used books that didn't look this horrible. I had to throw it away.
3,Cute book,"This is cute, but the best one in the series is Tykosaurs. That's the only one my son really likes."
2,Interesting Concept but flawed,I thought this was an interesting presentation of a pretty interesting concept. But the movie is fatally flawed. It is just plain boring and not compelling at all. Nicole Kidman is a very good actress but the movie has a weird vibe to it that just doesn't really ring true. I felt like I was watching somebodys vision of what and how people act but the persons view just seems like bunk and unreal.
2,Ambitious story-telling....,"Having watched 'Dogville' I was impressed by the methodology used to tell the story. It was ambitious achievement by the director but ultimately I felt the pace of the film to be ponderous and pretentious. What annoyed me most was the narration to the story which grated me. I liked the idea of the story-an almost Kafka like merger of fable and artistic license. But unfortunately relating this to film proved too difficult to achieve and what we end up with is something that fails to deliver.A valiant attempt at creating something different, worth watching for the innovative filming techniques but as a movie it just does not work for me.As for the criticisms of being anti-american, well the thought never crossed my mind because the setting could be anyway in the world. The story is a fable of human conditions and failings whatever nationality."
2,Just not very good.,"Von Trier's best work was done on ""The Kingdom"". This film is really more of a novelty than anything else. Worth renting but I wouldn't buy it."
1,From the Founder of the All-Movie Guide,"I will go out on a limb here and just call it a ""dog."" I was surprised it was in the form of a play with a theater-style set. I got over that. There was some good acting, but it was mostly ""play"" acting. I even grew tired of that as the film crawled along for three hours and got a little grumpy as it slowly loped downhill. I was hoping for some more positive resolution. I did have a good laugh at the ending. Serves them right. In short: I had enough ""lectures"" from all the art films I suffered through in the 1960s, when I was naive. I have no excuse now. I must apologize for my opinion to those who found substance in this film, but I consider it a real waste of my time. This is not how I want to be entertained."
5,Eyes Wide Open,"Wow, it's hard to know where to start on this movie without giving the whole thing away! I guess in reviews (as in Dogville) less is more. Permit me then to make a few observations.1. Dogville is probably the best movie of the year.2. Don't think this is your usual Nicole Kidman flick (as one of my friends did to her utter dismay).3. Don't walk out half way through (as a bunch of people did when I saw it.)You will hate Dogville, you will love Dogville and when it ends, hopefully you will understand Dogville. Is it anti-American? No. Is it misanthropic? Probably. Is it a parable? Sure, why not?Lars Von Trier is a self-indulgent, pretentious, unmistakable genius.To say anything else would be to say too much. You need to see this movie."
1,One bark movie,"(...) Endlessly and relentlessly grim, nonsensical and boring. There is no town like that - especially in the Rockies. I found myself wanting the vapid Nicole to whiz up into the flames. Never have liked her and even less in this mess."
1,Inexplicable nonsense - Are Minus Stars Possible?,Lewis Carroll would have given up writing had he been forced to endure this version of Through the Looking Glass. This film is anti-moviegoer.
1,Should have been named Dogpile,"I think the title of this review says it all. A waste of 3-hours. This might work for a small theater production group but as a movie, forget it."
1,A rather poor performance by Kidman,"The most disappointing aspect of this film, other than the direction + cutting, is Nicole Kidman's empty performance. She has come to the point in her career where she is offered far too many roles and can't pick the trash from treasure. If she doesn't slow down she may disappear. AVOID!!!"
1,Couldn't watch it,"Sorry, I need locations when watching a movie. I understand the director or writer was trying to be avante garde but this is ridiculous. Try to be edgy without losing the audience next time. Definitely for the brainiacs not for the realists."
1,Could be the WORST movie ever made !!!!!,"I own over 1500 DVDs.....This one is not good enough to pry my other DVD's out of my too tight shelves!!!This was a pet project of a madman...Pointless, depressing,boring,condecending,(did I say Boring?)Good G_d Almighty, I couldn't wait to get that DVD case of morbidity out of my house......save yourself.....run!!!"
3,Technical Problem,"My partner and I were both annoyed by the loudness of the narration relative to the dialogue of the actors. We kept turning the volume up, down, up, down . We rented the DVD, no way of knowing if they're all like that.We didn't understand the message of the movie, but I'm kind of hoping that Grace represents Mother Nature."
1,The name says it all.,"This experimental production was lurking in the Movie Section and so I rented it based on awards and on-box reviews. (major mistake) After scrolling through a couple scenes and getting confirmation from my sense that it all would be horrifically boring, (based on cheesy dialogue and claustrophic layout, I simply ejected it with the same weariness that might had beseiged me had I had watched it through its running time which is roughly one/eighth of a day. Even as an experiment this piece could have claimed less damage were it limited to 21 minutes tops. Three hours of it is cruelty. So what about all those awards? I just don't know. Maybe, after all, it's who you know."
1,BOW WOW,"Oh - what a waste of time, talent, and money. This odious production had such great potential, but it fails on so many levels, I won't bother to elaborate.I don't know you, but trust me, there is a 99.5% chance you won't like this film - honestly."
1,there are idiots...,and then there are scumbag idiots like lars von trier. if you dislike america so much you should have stayed in denmark you buffoon.avoid
3,A Film About Power Abuse,"This is a film about abusing one's power when fate accidentally shoved it in your face. The film attempted to probe deeply into the deepest, darkest corners of our psyches and make us see what would become of us (outwardly average human beings) if we were given the power over some helpless objects - saps/animals/subordinates etc. To say that this film is anti-American is less appropriate than to coin it as an anti-George Bush Jnr's film as America's Mr. President eloquently justified his heinous actions against Iraq and the people of US of A, much like the residents of Dogville explained away their misdeanours toward Grace, the protagonist of the movie.While no frills and all (a mere sound stage with little props), the cast was competent and Nicole Kidman portrayed her dual roles well - first the powerless in her descent into greater sufferings but finally blossoming into the fearless avenger on her road from DOGville to WELLville."
5,Dogville,"Filmed on a minimal soundstage with chalk lines and partial building facades, Von Trier's disturbing, provocative allegory of hypocrisy at the heart of the American soul is undeniably long at just under three hours, but still fascinating to watch. As the aptly named Grace, Kidman is sweet and above reproach, so we feel her pain at the hands of Dogville's putatively upstanding citizens, who reveal themselves to be closet sadists. Von Trier's direction is razor sharp, aided by a fantastic ensemble cast including Phillip Baker Hall, Chloe Sevigny, Stellan Skarsgaard, Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, and the wonderful John Hurt, whose impeccable voiceover edges this dark parable into the realm of classic fairy tale."
1,Boring,"Boring. I have to admit I wanted to like this film. I normally love experiments. But, this was an experiment that was just painful to watch. Everything about this film is pretentious, detached and it takes three times longer than it should. Yes, I get the sort of Our-Town set design. Yes, I get the conflict between self righteousness and forgiveness. Yes; I get the continuous sense of detachment. And, yes, I get that being too forgiving is not a favor. But after watching this I was left wondering why I had sacrificed three hours of my life to watch it. I still can't help thinking that with this collection of brilliant actors, they could have done so many extraordinary things. However, they did this, instead."
2,an extra star for the revenge plot,"too slow, it literally takes place on a generic stage to look like a play. Bushes and dogs are drawn in with chalk. It's a pillow movie. Its better to read the synopsis and skip ahead. I was going to give it one star, but Im a sucker for revenge movies, so I gave it an extra star. Its just to bad you have to get through 2-3hrs of movie just for the ending you've been waiting for. ZZZzzzzzzzzzzz"
2,A Dog,"""Dogville"" is lost. They tried to do a Broadway style or live acting play on the bigscreen. Seeing this performance live might have worked for me as it's much easier to relate or engage with live on-stage actors. However, put them on film without any adjustments to acting or style, including little editing, and it gets boring fast.In contrast, a related movie with this style, the Hitchcock movie ""Rope"", was successful by using very good camera work and lighting, more props, and extremely pronounced acting - almost over-emphasizing words and actions - that all transfered well to film. (Oh, the suspense helped engage the viewer too here.)Dogville was an experiment in film making, it's minimalistic approach won't appeal to many, and they didn't get the stage acting to work well on film. The film is lost between stage acting style and film media style."
1,Waste of time.,"Dogville is such a long, boring, pretentious movie I have ever seen! I was expecting something great even spectacular but Dogville is highly over-rated and horrible. I like Nicole Kidman, wonderful, gifted actress but why did she do this movie? She must have been out of her ever-loving skull to take this weighty film on her shoulders. Lauren Bacall's acting is so wooden, what's so great about her anyway? Don't waste one second on Dogville, it's awful!"
4,"Yes, it's Long, but...","Don't avoid seeing a movie because of the running time. Yes, ""Dogville"" is three hours long. Yes, there are almost no sets. But ""Dogville"", which has been accused of being anti-American but absolutely isn't, is one of the best films of 2004.Set in a fictional Rockie mountains town in the 1930s, ""Dogville"" tells the story of Grace (Nicole Kidman, in a tour-de-force performance), a woman on the run, being chased by vicious mobsters. In Dogville, she finds temporary asylum and love, in the form of Tom (Paul Bettany, also terrific). But when the people of Dogville turn on someone, they really turn.I really liked the ending of this film, but I won't give anything away.The fantastic ensemble cast includes Lauren Bacall, James Caan, Chloe Sevigny, Patricia Clarkson, Philip Baker Hall, and Stellan Skarsgaard."
2,not a very good movie.,"I just finished watching Dogville. The concept and story are awesome. The acting and script are decent at best - I think von Trier did everything in one take and didn't care how wooden or emotionless the acting was as long as he had the shot. The use of the narrator is such a lazy thing to do - a director should show the audience what the characters are thinking and feeling, not tell them. I don't have a qualm with narrations if used only a few brief times in a film. Dogville uses narration very frequently and for no real reason other than Lars von Trier didn't feel like showing (or couldn't figure out how to show) the audience what is happening. The editing is dreadful. There are random jump cuts that exist for no reason (unlike, say, Traffic or Memento where the jump cuts make sense or at least look awesome). The film annoyed me more than it entertained me or made me think. I rate the film a 2/5, mostly for the concept and story. Dogville had so much potential."
1,recorded theater-totally lacks cinematic quality,"large stage, way artificial sets, yadda after yadda after yadda, AND an excruciatingly irritating hand-held camera. who wants motion sickness as part of their movie experience? i watched 10 minutes, then fast-forwarded thru the rest looking for ""cinema"". not to be had."
1,Pretentious Dog Doo - Worst Movie Ever!,"It is as if some college freshman said,"" Hey, I got fifty bucks. Let's make a movie!"" Don't waste your money! Don't waste your time! This incredibly boring piece of dog crap pretends to be an avant garde, cutting edge, artsy film commenting on the human condition which is being loved by pseudo intellectuals impressed by their own pretentious sophistication. Their attitude is, ""If you aint smart enough, you won't get it."" The fact is, the truly intelligent will see this movie and say the truth. The emperor has no clothes on at all."
1,Dogville...one big dog-pile!,"Absolutely the worst film I have ever seen! I remember thinking while I viewed this dog...well, maybe it'll get better--something will happen...To save you time (coz I'll never get mine back), nothing does happen! I also thought that maybe, just maybe, someone had slipped some bad acid in my soda when I wasn't looking...everything seemed vague and disjointed, and time...it seemed like this movie was over 7 hours long! See it if you must, but don't say you weren't warned! Oh, the one star rating...I would have picked zero--but it wasn't an option."
1,dogville..dullsville,"i watched maybe 20 min. of this boring spectacle and realized that once again i bought a lemon..this is not a true movie but more like a play that was filmed..it all takes place on a stage..i can't even say that it's worth a rental,it has an amazing roster of a-list hollywood cast including nicole kidman but don't be fooled this is really bad."
1,Blech,"This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time - and I'm including my most recent rental of ""Ocean's Twelve.""""Dogville"" is a trite attempt at best to explore the depths of America's so-called xenophobic tendencies. But what concerns me more is that gratuitous rape scenes are considered an arty revolution by mainstream society. Are people saying that Nicole Kidman is only a good actress when she becomes a fetishized object?There is nothing about this movie that interested me except for the fast-forward button on my remote control."
2,Ok listen up people,"Here is the gist of every Trier movie. Take a woman and make her suffer excrutiatingly for as long as possible. Any attempt for the victim to showcase their innoncence, even if it matters to say only 3 words, will not happen (this film and Dancer in the Dark). There you have it.I would describe Trier as a ""Brilliant"" sadist. Nothing more. Everyone knows he takes his actors and litteraly tortures them. As a result of Dogville which has great performances and an ingenious execution, but goes on far too long, finishes in a feat of pure nihilism, and ends with a giant what the??The guy is a lunatic people. I dare YOU to watch this movie.Rating 2.5 stars"
5,a meditation on how power corrupts,"This movie has been widely misunderstood. It is not anti-American. It is not a meditation on the baseness of humans. What it is, is a meditation on how power corrupts us -- all of us. It corrupted the peaceful little town. It ultimately corrupted Grace. Is it pessimistic, or realistic? What are the implications for how we should live in society? What are the implications for how countries, whether they be the USA, China, Rwanda, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, operate? It gets you thinking."
2,DOG!!!,"WOOF WOOF! And I lke ALL of Lars' other movies. Have sat through all of Kingdom I and II twice... but this one just didn't do it for me. I actually sat thru all of a 170m foreign DVD just because it WAS a Lars flick and am only giving it 2 stars instead of 1 for the same reason. Boring, pretentious."
1,Dogville...,"Having seen Breaking the Waves, which I did enjoy although disturbing yet thought provoking I expected more of the same in Dogville. However, this is the worst move I think I've ever seen. After watching for about 10 minutes of this it came out of my DVD. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay to rent it."
1,Boring Boring Boring,What a boring movie!!! Very slow paced. if you turn the subtitles on you can watch the entire thing in 2X without missing a thing. This was low budget boring film. I would not waste my time.
2,Warning : This is done on a set like a play and not like a movie.,"This may be well written and done as far as plays go. If you are expecting a traditional movie you may be disappointed.This is done on a college type set with some props etc. The picture posted is misleading. I should have read the reviews but made a quick decision. Oh well, if you like school plays you might like it as long as you know up front what it is."
5,FantasticResults,"The high-ratio shortening complements my 6-X Buttercream icing formula beautifully, and the convenience of the smaller-than-usual weighted package -- scaled for the home baker -- is un-paralleled. Wishing to thank you for hunting down yet another fantastic associate and product source.Best,Mark Loveland"
1,"A Primer on Christianity, not a book about child-rearing","I bought this book thinking Ross Campbell had some insights on child-rearing. However, I am sadly dissapointed because it is simply a christian tract in disguise in my opinion.If you want to raise a Christian Child, see your pastor. Otherwise, save your money."
3,Fair but not the best,"The book is slightly shallow, in that it doesn't go in depth but skims the surface with fact. This is not necessarily a defect in the book, but it reads more like entertainment-news than information. I would still recommend it to anyone naive about drug money laundering."
3,entertaining but biased,"A fun book to read, although I wondered if someone in the DEA paid the author to write it! In Robinson's view of the world, the US government is always right. US government agents wear white hats, businessmen and their lawyers and accountants and bankers wear black hats. Robinson never questions the motives of the DEA/FBI/IRS officials whom he uses as information sources. He never questions the wisdom of the US war on drugs; indeed, he seems keen on expanding this war by enlisting financial intermediaries as government proxies. He ignores the likely impact of currency and financial controls on economic growth and personal liberty. He appears to have spent little time in the non-OECD world, where government corruption is the rule and where honest citizens have every reason to use cash and to hide their savings ""offshore"". In short: good entertainment value, and slick PR for Uncle Sam's drug warriors, but not an authoritative book by any means."
4,Some very good sections,"This book is a very good basic introduction to money laundering. There are some very good chapters or parts of chapters, including: a description of the basic money laundering process, examples of how FINCEN uses CTR data, descriptions of Carribean (and other laundering havens') bank secrecy policies, etc. Many of the chapters degenerate into countless real-life examples of laundering schemes in painstaking detail. Overall, however, there is a lot of good, useful information in this book geared towards readers who are looking for a basic overview of money laundering."
3,Almost a correct summary of the business,"Having worked in the law enforcement arena for the past ten years. I look with great earnest for authors and books which deal with my area of expertise. The Laundrymen is an entertaining and quick read. The subject matter could be tedious but Robinson makes it read like a novel. However, in order for him to do so, he takes liberty with some of the facts. He incorrectly identifies some names and places and also some of the facts. Although for the most part, he is correct. The book, for those who either know or were a part of some of the cases he mentions, is somewhat of a let down.I found the book a quick an pleasurable read and recommend it to anyone who has an interest in law enforcement and money laundering."
1,Spend more elsewhere and get a better one,"I have this particular charger and it's a waste of money. A month after I bought it, the timer wouldn't work in the ""on"" position. Another month later, the timer wouldn't wind down. You could set it for 15 minutes but the charger would stay on forever. Lost a couple of batteries before realizing this was the problem. 6 months later, it doesn't work at all.This charger also doesn't include a diode to prevent draining the battery if the charger is unplugged. It might also drain batteries when turned off, but I can't verify that.I'd recommend spending $$$ more and getting a better charger. I did.Liza's Dad"
2,Sexy Rangers,The movie wasn't that great. 5 girls in swimsuit. Cheesy action. The girls r cute though. It's like a japenese version of the power ranger except girl with tis and in a swimsuit.
1,FYI,"I am not the recipient of this book. An associate of my daughter will be carrying the book, with others, back to India for my 13 year old grandson. It will be used as part of his homeschool studies. The 1-star rating is only because you demanded it (it may deserve much higher). I am, indeed, over the age of 13 -- by nearly seven decades."
5,A Wonderful Story,I have never been so completely enveloped into a story! Andrea Kane's writing is phenomenal. I fell in love with both characters. I would recommend this book to every historical romance lover!
5,My hearts desire,Excellent historical romance and good story.i love her writing.i can read her story over and over.this story also hasGood suspense.
5,The Best I've ever read!!,Wonderful Charaters with a delightful plot. A great adventure with lots of romance.
2,"Good filter, bad cross reference from Wix","Wix showed this filter as a direct replacement for the Bolens G174 tractor. In reality, it is 1.5"" too long. The old filter has clogged so I cut this one down to make it fit in the filter box."
5,self defense kicks...,"this book contains kicks that an ordinary person could use for self defense...if you don't want to spend years perfecting your ""jumping spinning back kick"" andhope that you can use it in a real situation then buy this book."
3,For people with no martial arts training,"I thought the book was decent, but it really is for a person with little or no training. The kicks are basic karate kicks that any white belt at the YMCA is familiar with.The book also covered weight training to enhance your low kicks. Weight trainging?! Once again, obviously written for the complete novice and obviously padding the pages with common knowledge.The book basically covers basic kicks and how to practice them. Interesting, but there is nothing in the book that I couldn't have figured out on my own.I was hoping for a detailed description of how/when to attack knees to effect particular injury, or knock a person out by kicking the femoral artery. I know how to kick! I wanted to learn some of the ways to use those most kicks effectively."
3,"Elam McKnight - Braid My Hair (Bigblackhand.Com, 2003)","You can find many kinds of blues here. This eclectic work from rising star on blues scene offers deep delta blues, fiery boogie, soulful blues etc. Songs are performed both on electric and acoustic guitars. Elam himself describes his music as ""Roots Blues"". Whether these are his own songs (which count to majority) or covers, (Robert Johnson's ""Terraplane Blues"" and traditional ""Devil Got Religion"") the feeling is all the same: raw blues. Elam is equally good on both electric and acoustic guitars.He is a sound songwriter too. Seven of 12 songs (actually of nine songs since three of them are repeated) are originals. Among them ""Sugar Cane"" has to be emphasized particularly. Soulful pearl in the delta wilderness. Keep an eye open on this guy!Personnel: Elam McKnight - guitar & vocals; Zack Reynolds - harp; Ronnie Godfrey - piano; Cedric Burnside - drums.pastblues.com"
5,2-8 rule,"This cd is great played #2 through #8. It is wonderful, and those 7 songs have the right flow from one song to the next. Enanitos have a great sound. This is their second best album just under the newest one."
2,Disappointing,"Big Bang, their 1993 CD was great, but since then the Enanos have fallen a long way. Very disappointing, only 1 or 2 decent songs here."
3,Itty Bitty Stool,"I suppose it would be ok for a small makeup station in an apartment, but not very good for a larger size home. I purchased two thinking they'd be about the size of the Annie Chairs I'd purchased from Walmart. They are about half the size. They are too small to be comfortable for anyone over a size 8. I ended up giving them to my daughters to use in their music station to practice their instruments."
2,Child-size Swivel Chair,"I bought this to use for my vanity and ended up returning it. The back on the chair wraps around just enough that you have to be TINY, as in child-size to actually ""fit"" in this chair.Otherwise, it was easy to assemble and seemed like it would have been a really nice stool--if only it didn't have the back on it."
3,Stool,Seems sturdy and I like the swivel aspect. Very easy to put together. The shape of the back is not quite even on both sides.
2,How to Play the Flute,only adequate. The book only offered the VERY basics - had expected it to at least go beyond basics into intermediate skills - - could have done it without the book! Lessons were extremely over-repetitive
3,"Ok, but really lacks a beginners need for practice and fingering",This book is not as good as people have reviewed. My daughter's beginner flute book from Band is superior in every way. It has proper exercises and fingering. This book just rambles on about things that will not get you far. More like frustrated.
4,It was good but....,"Well were should I begin.... 1st of all I thought this book was ok becasue some of the symbols were a little mis-drawn but on the most part It explained how to hold the flute using the right fingerings. As a beginer I found it helpfull to buy the 2000 Methoid Flute book becasue the cd in the book is very help full, but that book needs this one to fill in were it assumes you already know. The author is very good in explaining though and gives alot of detail. I tought my self so I dont know how it will work for somone that is taking lessons."
3,How to play the flute,You seem to need some 'beforehand' experience for this book. Not for a beginner. Difficult to follow when you 'know nothing'.
3,More Help May Be Needed,"This book has useful information but another book is needed to learn the flute, or better yet a live teacher. This book contains too much basic music background and not enough flute playing support."
5,great glasses,I bought one set and loved them so much I bought a second set of the double old fashoned as well as a set of the larger high ball glasses. They do very well in the dishwasher and have a nice weight and look to them.
5,Very nice and classy,"I have purchased these glasses 3 times now to have them engraved for going away gifts. They are nice and heavy and take to engraving well. They have plenty of room on them to engrave a symbol on two sides, more than two might look a little gaudy. In our case, these are for military folks getting transferred to a new duty location and we are engraving their rank (a picture of their stripes) and their squadron patch. They look very nice and people have said they would like them as their going away gift as well. Highly recommended."
2,No likey,"I bought 2 of these and 1 of them is a menace, always going off in the middle of the night and we can't shut it off. So, we keep it outside in the garage but it still goes off sometimes. The other one is not going off for no reason, but if it gets bumped out of the outlet- the shrill is relentless and it is not easy to reset. The directions are on the back of this thing, but you have to sit through the shrilling beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeppp while you read the instructions. It's enough to drive a person CRAZY. Babies are screaming, pets are running. It's unnecessarily loud."
1,Almost a joke...,"This thing is so bad it's almost funny. Except I wasn't laughing when it woke the household up with a false alarm at 6 AM on a Sunday morning. This wasn't the low-battery chirp -- it was the full-on alarm. After finally getting it to stop shrieking (no easy feat, as you have to unscrew the battery compartment and yank the battery out to get it to shut up), I decided to hold off on calling 911. No gas appliances had been running, the windows were open, and no one in the family was suffering from symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. I ran out to a local store to buy another brand of alarm with a digital display. It has been plugged in for several hours now, and as I suspected, it's not registering any carbon monoxide.This was just the final straw in a long string of irritating incidents. It always had a knack for picking the most inopportune times to notify us of the low battery, and we could never remove it from the outlet without being subjected to its ear-splitting screech."
1,Too tamper resistant for safety's sake,"Shame on Kidde for not recalling this ""tamper resist alarm."" It is downright scary that the packaging on this product advertises it as ""ideal for children's rooms or rental property."" Nobody would want this device in their home, particularly with small children or other tenants nearby. There is a risk that it will malfunction and damage your hearing and possibly that of others as well. Here are the facts: (1) When the device malfunctions, it emits a continuous eardrum-splitting alarm for no reason. (2) If that happens to you, you will find that the reset button does not work, and you cannot immediately silence the alarm as the packaging represents. (3) Instead, the device is designed to be so tamper-resistant that you can't silence the alarm until you remove the battery, and you can't do that until you find the right screwdriver to open the battery compartment. I shudder to think what would happen to someone who is unable to find the right screwdriver in time."
1,Poor Quality and Customer Service,"Purchased in late 2007, this unit is no longer working. It is supposed to have a 7 year life span. Unit continually gives the ""low battery"" warning, even though I have removed the battery. Contacted the manufacturer directly, and they have not responded to repeated requests. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, POOR QUALITY. DO NOT BUY."
1,Unsafe and Unreliable,"I bought this alarm and it started to malfunction after three months. I did everything exactly as detailed in the instructions. I thought the battery must be low, but after replacing with a brand new battery, I had the exact same issue. I even tried reversing the battery to ensure that it was installed properly. Nothing worked.I'm still trying to get in touch with customer service. I was on hold for 20 minutes on the phone before giving up and now cannot get their email form to work either.This is an unsafe alarm because it gives false alarms. Who would believe it was giving a real alarm after it had given so many false alarms? After having the HVAC service come and check everything in the house, I know that I have no CO emissions, but the alarm continues to go off."
1,DANGEROUS product-Contact Consumer Product Safety Commission,"This product is DANGEROUS- it is unreliable and gives false alarms when CO is not present. Additionally, the alarm, which is supposed to be 85 decibels, is painfully loud and cannot be turned off with the reset-test button as specified in the directions. My new unit screamed for nearly an hour outdoors even after I approached it with ear protection to try to silence it with the reset button.DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT AND IF YOU HAVE, I RECOMMEND CONTACTING THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION. I personally believe that I have ear damage just from my brief exposure to this ear-splitting alarm."
1,"Unfortunately, I bought one these...","Another crazy Kiddie alarm- when you unplug it from the wall socket, it starts a positively ear-shattering alarm.And the ALARM DOES NOT STOP! It seems to revel in destroying your ear-drums.So eventually, you decide to take out the battery- BUT WAIT! That requires a screwdriver! Do you have one around? Should to stomp on it until it decides to shut up? Maybe you were born without ears and this it not an issue for you- but it is for me and makes me certain that I will never, EVER, buy any Kiddie products in future."
2,Serious issues with setup,I initialized this thing and it went off and I couldn't shut it off with out using a screw driver to remove the battery housing and then pulling the battery out. I bought 3 of them and it happened to all 3. I haven't gone back and investigated what set them off like that. My ears are still ringing.
1,Won't run on AC power,"I bought this a few weeks ago, and still can't get it to operate on AC power, no matter which outlet I plug it into. The plug itself is poor quality (made in China, no surprise there) and does not plug solidly into any wall outlet. The once-every-20-second green light flashing tells me that the battery backup is still working, but since it won't run on regular power, it's going to die as soon as the battery runs out of juice. Big waste of money."
1,Same issue other had...fails after 1 year,"I had bought two of these, and one gave us the most sleepless nights ever as we could not figure out what was wrong.As another reviewer in another FA alarm had said, I would never buy Kidde again. (Are they Kiddeing with our lives ??)"
1,Rubbish,We've had this thing for just over two months - it started chirping last week and all indications were that it needed a new battery. I changed the battery and it would not stop screeching. I removed and replaced the battery assuming it was not making a good connection and it seemed to be OK. After two days it started chirping again. I had already moved another detector next to it so I knew we weren't getting too much CO2 so its going back to HD tomorrow.
1,Rare malfunction causes false alarm,"Well, I didn't write this to bash the product. However, I wanted to make sure that others are familiar with this malfunction. While my family was preparing for dinner, the alarm made one continuous high pitched,piercing sound (not separate beeps). I couldn't shut it off, and now my ears hurt a little bit. After getting fresh air and resetting the battery, it seemed to OK. However, the family was already disturbed, and because the manual doesn't mention anything about a continuous beep(siren), we knew that we couldn't trust the alarm and called the fire dept. directly. They did a reading and thank God it was 0 everywhere, even by both of the furnaces and water heater. I'm going to return it for a new one and use it as a spare. For the primary alarm, I plan to purchase another brand with a readout screen. I am so glad that this happened at 6:00pm and not 2:00 am! By the way, we've only had the alarm less than 6 months. Good luck!"
1,unnecessarily loud when there is no carbon monoxide,It is a good idea to have a very loud alarm when there is carbon monoxide detected. Better to have sore ears that to stay asleep.But do we need a painfully loud alarm because the battery is getting low? Or because someone unplugged it from the wall? Do we need the loud beeping to continue while you're looking for a screwdriver to open the battery compartment? The alarm is so loud it puts you in a panic to do anything to SHUT IT OFF as soon as possible.No. I have these in my house and the false alarm tonight is the last straw.DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL unless it's a gift for someone you secretly dislike.
1,I really dislike the tamper alarm,"It was slightly ajar in the wall, still powered on though. Pushed it in further. Started chirping. Took it out to see what was going on and try to stop it (because it was in the room with someone who is sensitive to loud noise). Then this insane ""tamper"" constant alarm starts shrieking (and it sounded WAAAAY louder than 85 dB) until we finally plugged it back in and reset it.I hate to think what would happen if there's a power outage. A backup battery is meant to keep it working when off AC, not to make it sound like being off AC is worse than CO gas itself."
3,"A pain, but serviceable","We had the same problem with this tamper-proof CO2 monitor.1) Use an extension cord to plug it in...to stop the screeching and gain better access to change the battery.(This could be done with the unit on the wall if you have a flat head)2) Remove the battery with a phillips screwdriver...the battery top slides off, after peeling off the info tag on the back which conceals this fact.3) After changing the battery, ultimately will purchase a new monitor with digital readout...but without tamper-proof feature."
1,What a waste of money!,"Purchased this alarm for a rental unit in Pennsylvania, despite reading several ""not so favorable"" reviews. Don't waste your money! This alarm started beeping after only 6 months in service. Tried to contact the supplier, but to no avail. Next stop, right to Kidde. I've used other carbon monoxide products by them, which lasted 4-5 years. Must be a manufacturing defect on this particular model."
2,Battery Backup Doesn't Work,"I didn't have problems with random alarms like other reviewers, but the battery backup stopped working within a couple of months. My toddler unplugged the alarm a couple of times. After the second time, the battery backup stopped working. I tried resetting it, a fresh battery, etc. and nothing worked. It seems to work (flashing light) on AC power, but who knows?"
3,Do you have an outlet up high enough on the wall?,"After buying this detector that plugs into an outlet, I read elsewhere that CO detectors should be mounted minimum 5 feet above the floor. None of my outlets are high enough in the areas where the detector should be placed (outside each sleeping area). I rated 3-stars only because that information should be in the product description!!"
4,Well written and erotic,"I enjoyed this book. I admit to being a long term contributor to Literotica as PAUL C.Not all the subject matter was necessarily to my taste but all the stories are very well crafted and well written.To regular visitors to such sites as Literotica some of the stories may be over long and the sex scenes not as explicit as they would be used to. That said, if it is an erotic read you are looking for rather than porn then this is probably as good as any you will find."
5,love the site... love the book!,"The website is a fantastic place for lovers and new writers of erotica to publish, get reviews, and read short fiction that is not published on the written page. The book is a collection of some of their best stories. Check out the website at literotica.com and if you like it, you will LOVE the book. (I myself have published on the site under the author name of ""JJ"".)"
1,Hypocricy of Literotica,Everyone still talked about how hot this book was after it sold out.I have read dozens of other stories on Literotica that I thought were very good stories and deserved the classification 'Very Best of Literotica'.In this book; the stories weren't very hot or exciting to me. I would retitle this book 'Not The Very Best of Literotica'I hope they pick a better selection crew to pick stories for book 2.
5,Fabulous Addition,This was a great addition to the set I purchased a year ago. There are times when I didn't need the larger saucepans but was already using the smaller one. So I purchased 2 more to add to the set. It works well when I'm just cooking for 2.
1,Non-stick my foot!?,"Scenario: First use this morning. 3/4 filled with water, brought to boil, added two eggs, poached for 3 to 4 minutes, removed eggs with plastic pierced spoon. Turned off burner. Ate breakfast. Did dishes, then poured water out of pan. Egg white residue stuck on bottom just like Revere stainless/copper bottom I was trying to replace, though residue not as heavy. Rinsed with detergent, did not try to remove residue as it resisted finger effort to move. Later, after pan dried, the residue came off with light finger rubbing.Warning! This item is advertised as ""non-stick hard anodized"" They don't tell you that the HA is just on the outside, and that the interior is ""Quantanium"", whatever that is.Only time will tell if this 27 buck item will remain a part of our cookware."
3,"Nice pot, poor handle","I am very happy with the size and design of this non stick pot. I only wish that the handle was more substantial....to offset the weight of the pot, especially when loaded with food. The handle could be wider or thicker."
3,"Lid Handle ""HEATS"" up","The package for the pan arrived timely and was very well wrapped and the pan itselfwas the size I wanted. The one problem that I have found with the pan is that ifyou are cooking something that takes more than a few minutes, the lid handle get HOT.I always end up having to use a potholder to remove the lid. Not a really big dealin the scheme of things but a real inconvenience when comparing to other brands andtheir lids."
3,"Got my money's worth for 2.5yrs, but not holding up",Loved in the beginning. Noticed scratching around rim after 6months-1yr. Heats fasts. Looks good. Light weight (not good). Flaking & major scratching inside after 2yrs.
1,Ruined product,"The saucepan came with a STICKER in the center of it. Once I finally got the sticker removed, it left a residue that you cannot get off without ruining the nonstick coating.Who ever was dumb enough to put a sticker in the middle of the cooking surface should personally come to my house, apologize, and give me a refund."
5,Love it!,"FINALLY! We have gone through a few different types of well known pots and this is the first time I can actually say I'm impressed. My husband is the real cook. I do the clean-up. We both are happy with the cooking qualities but I am OVERJOYED with the easy cleaning. We even overcooked spaghetti sauce one time, almost burnt, and the pan just wiped clean!! If I sound excited, I am. Years of scrubbing and giving up on pots has made this a great thing for me. We have most of a set."
1,Terrible pan don't waste your money!!!,I just got this pan today. It looked sturdy and well made. I used it one time for about 3 minutes. After I washed it with a sponge (nothing to scratch it) like normal I saw that the nonstick coating was already flaking off in several places. I'm surprised there were so many positive reviews. This is a terrible product do not waste your money! I would give no stars if I could.
4,Good,"I would recomment the Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick Hard-Anodized 4-Quart Saucepan. My purchase is very recent, so I would say so far it has been very helpful for all my cooking. However the bottom sticks sometimes if the Saucepan is placed on very high heat. The food cooks evenly and well.The Lid does not get heated up which is an added advantage and makes it convenient to handle the saucepan when its on high heat."
1,Unacceptable!,"The pan may be fine, but the one I received came with a lid that would not stay on the pan. This one is going back immediately."
3,"They do the job, but the overall quality is "" just OK "".","For the money paid, these 1 qt saucepans are fine. They are not Calphalon or Anolon, but then, they are not priced in the same way."
2,Poor finish,"I have used this pot probably a dozen times so far and the biggest issue I have is the oxidized finish. The finish is blotchy, showing wet spots, fingermarks and leaves a chaulky resedue on your hands when you touch it. That was before I washed it after it was soaking in the sink for a few hours. A simple wipe with a sponge and all of the dark oxidized finsih came right off. Now it is a dull light silver. The chaulkyness is much less now but it looks like a cheap hand-me-down. I have no complaints about the non-stick surface but the stay-cool cover handle still can get hot enough to need a glove."
4,A perfect size for a lot of kitchen creations.,"A little too lightweight, but it works anyway, this little pot is always in use. Oatmeal, rice, boiling eggs, heating soup.Everything smallish works here. I could use 2 of them, but I do not do that in a small NY kitchen."
5,cuisinart pot,never been happier with a kitchen purchase - these pots are wonderful. cleaning is a breeze.
2,Skimpy saucepan,I would not have ordered this item had I known that the only way it would hold its rated capacity would be to fill it right to the very brim. I returned it for that reason
1,Nonstick coating melt after 5 months,"First thing, it's not real Hard-Anodized.The 2nd thing is that the nonstick coating is so poor quality.My wift used it to cook noodle some time for my baby, but last month some day, I found the nonstick coating is already melted!Stay away from Cuisinart."
4,1.5 quart,I'm not sure that all the reviews here are for this particular model. I like it. It looks good. I wouldn't call it lightweight ... it has enough heft to it. I haven't noticed the handle getting hot or even warm. I suspect that some folks are using a flame or burner which is wider than the pot bottom. Certainly if you apply heat directly to the handle it will get hot but I haven't felt the pot transferring heat through the handle at all. I had a one quart which was a little too small and a two quart which was a bit too big. So like Goldilocks I was looking for something in the middle but one and a half quart pots are hard to find. This pot at this price at this quality was just right. An added bonus is that this pot heats quickly. I noticed that this pan boiled water much faster than my other pots.
3,Functional But With Issues,"I own numerous Cuisinart products and ordered this 1-1/2 qt. saucepan expecting great quality, but this pan disappointed me a bit. It's functional and suits my needs - I mostly bought it to cook rice and sauces - but the lid definitely does not fit snugly. The lid on my pan jiggles back and forth and quite a bit of steam escapes as foods cook. The ""stay cool"" handle on the pan does stay cool, but the handle on the lid gets quite hot, so have a pot holder handy. It's not worth the hassle to me to return this pan, but it doesn't seem like the Cuisinart quality I've come to expect."
1,Lid does not fit,I have other Cuisinart pans and am happy with them. This one has a warped lid which I did not realize until after I had thrown the packaging away. The lid does not fit properly. B. Adams
3,"Great, but it gets hot!","The previous reviewers did well highlighting the benefits of this saucepan. My only gripe is that the handle gets incredibly hot. Still, it cools down quickly with exposure to water."
3,Good construction but handles are poorly insulated.,"When it comes to pots, it's hard to review without having it for several months. What I notice right out of the box however is that the lid lacks a vent and that the handles (both lid and saucepan) get very hot very quickly. I boiled water in it and the lid handle burned me.Either get a sleeve for it the way you would for a cast-iron, or get something else. The non-stick apparently does not hold well either."
4,A good deal!,"This pan is durable, easy to use, easy to clean. The only real problem that I encountered with it is that it can take a little while to heat up because the directions recommend not heating it up too fast on very high heat. Another problem that I encountered with this pan is that the handle can get pretty hot, especially when you are boiling water or something. You will definitely need some glove thing around in order to operate this pan properly.Overall it's not too bad, like I said, it's a good deal for its price."
1,Nonstick issues and worst customer service ever.,"I bought this saucepan and after 6 months a ring appeared inside the non-stick coat. As the company boasts in lifetime warranty,I tried to contact them...1st try - on hold for 50 minutes - can't leave a message as well - gave up.2nd try - emailed customer service with a photo of the pan - no reply.3rd try - got hold of them, was told I need to send it over to them and also add $7 for the return shipping!I paid $22, so to pay $14 just to get a new one after this one was defective seems excessive.I have a few other non nonstick Quisinart pans and they are great. Don't buy the nonstick ones."
4,Easy to handle,"Nice shape and finish, light but sturdy, rim makes pouring easy, good for sauces, small quantities of veggies, etc. etc"
3,Needs an on-off switch,Nice compact charger. Hard to believe that it does not have an on-off switch. I don't think it's a good idea to hook a charger to your battery hot and I will install a switch on mine.
3,out of tune,"A talented writer, the author lost me at the end. He skips the resolution, reason and logic of the crime. He removes a major character as an aside. He spends time on memory and insignificance and short changes the reader on the big stuff."
2,lost at cripple creek,"couldn't have been more lost with the plot and characters, title looked good but content not that great! Would not recommend even for light read."
3,Flawed Tale Made Worse by Typos,"Some of the writing was lovely, but the story was seriously flawed -- in my opinion -- by far too many flashbacks and extraneous material. Sometimes I felt that the author was just trying to fill a certain number of pages! Also, the Kindle edition is so riddled with misspelled words, omitted words, strange punctuation and misplaced capital letters that I wouldn't advise anyone to buy that version of the book. Terribly distracting. Glad I only paid $1.99 for it."
2,"Sorry, Mr. Sallis","One of the few times ever I haven't finished a novel. I'll read anything. Really. But I just cant get through this one. Maybe it's the Kindle version, there seem to be some serious typos and formatting, but I just keep getting lost and confused.For now, I step away, maybe I'll try again some day."
2,Like it Less than Lew,"I suppose this is great minimalist noir style writing but at times one can hardly tell what is going on in the story. Sallis gives the reader so little at times that i find myself having to read the page twice, and even then i do not get much from it. Turner is a somewhat interesting character but there's not enough meat there for me. Sallis' Lew Griffin stories which take place in New Orleans in the 60s are far better. Lew is an ex-collector for loan sharks who becomes a French Lit prof at Tulane and a practicing alcoholic. He's the thinking man to James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux. A bit like Thorn in James W Hall's Fla Key stories."
4,Certainly different,"After hearing rave reviews about James Sallis, I thought I would try one of his novels.He is somewhat like James Lee Burke in his setting of the book and some of the habits of the main character but he is not at that level (at least in this book) yet. I wouldn't say I was amazed by the writing but it was good enough that I will try another of his books when I can.The lead character is Turner, an ex-cop, ex-con and former therapist who is now a Deputy Sheriff in a small town. Without going into too much detail, there is a crime committed which forces Turner into some violent action.It is a short and quick read (never a bad thing) with writing that at times is quite poetic and certainly different.Worth a try if you see this novel around."
5,Yellow Weights,I really like these. They are small enough to pack away and use whenever you want. I love the different colored weights a lot!
4,For Young Adult Discussion...,"Our church congregation just started a young adult Sunday school class. As a self-initiated and self-taught discussion group, our deficiency was in members' teaching skills. Guthrie's book provides a fantastic intro for the beginning discussion leader and each lesson is focused, yet complex. The clear focus helps the leader keep the class on task, while the complexity allows for some tangentiality without risk of losing purpose. An excellent resource for young adult discussion groups."
1,DEBJ,Just had bladder surgery 2 months ago was looking for the balls to help with keigal excersizes. These are not the ones! They not only make a noise when you walk[ like a bell sound ] they have a seam on them and if they get too low it will it will pinch the skin. I tried but they are too unconfortable. Am going to order the seemless rubber ones. I should have known what I was getting for 3.99.
1,left in the dark,"several people told me about this product so I sent off for some when I received my balls ,there was no pouch and there were no instructions on how to use them, so their only good a paper weight"
3,Decent belt organizer,"I purchased this item to organize my belt collection. The organizer looks nice and seems well made. No sharp edges or rough spots that could snag other items in my closet. While the belts with larger buckles can only fit alone on one hook... in some cases, I can hang up to 2 belts with smaller buckles on a single hook. Once full, this can get a tad bit heavy and bulkier than expected.... but it's still a good product."
3,A nice product,The product is well made. But the hooks are too wide to hang some of my narrow belts. I wish the hooks were smaller.
4,Great oraganizer and space saver for your belts,"This is a great items that does exactly what it's supposed to do - no more, no less. It quickly organizes your belts so that you can easily access them. This is much better than a 'ring' organizer (which I had previously) because you don't have to take off several belts to get to the one you want. You can hang 2 belts on the hooks giving you more capacity with one hanger. I've only had this for about a month but it seems to be durable and doesn't tip when hanging on the pole."
5,Belt hanger,This is a wonderful little belt hanger. My husband immediately filled it and I had to order a second one.
3,True story,"I know the family that this movie was based on. It's not fiction. They shared memories of the interviews they went through with the writers. The family is from western Washington State, the girl is now about 40 years old. Of all people she married a minister with emotional problems...a minister whose church hurt people and left a mess for others to clean up. A Christian church, but with enough unhealthy personal issues that it was not a safe place for Christians to entrust their spiritual well being. People who are deeply hurt...they deeply hurt people."
1,DO NOT BUY PRAGUE,"My wife purchased for me a Prague watch similar to this one. Over the course of a year, it has worked for less than a month. We took it to a reputable jeweler, and he wondered how it ever worked at all. The movements are cheap Chinese knock-off movements. Save your money. Buy a real watch, not something from Prague."
2,HUGE!,I had no idea that these were so big! I was just looking for some normal Chinese balls with no chimes so I could carry them around in my purse. No where does it say these are so big; the picture even makes them look normal sized.I'm debating whether or not it's worth returning these. They are so huge and heavy the postage would be too much. They are very big for my hands so I can't really use them. What on earth do I do with these now? What a waste of $20..... =(
5,excellent warm up exercise before playing the guitar,"I am recovering from trigger finger an C/P. I use these exercise balls every day because they help me keep playing the guitar and maintain a good grip. I was told by the doctors that a good grip is a sign of a healthy body. All I know is, fifteen minutes a day brought me from no playing to 2 to 3 hrs of playing in about 2 years with no surgery. These exercise balls are a excellent addition to your reflexology work out for healthy hand and grip exercise."
5,Terrific,"Doc Holliday's Road To Tombstone is a page turner from beginning to end. From growing up in Griffin, becomming a Dentist his romance with Matti and his affair with the Firey Kate to the very interesting courtroom scene after the shooting.Terrific book you will want to read it more then once."
4,Doc Holliday's Road to Tombstone,"Although I am a former graduate student in history, the history of Wild West isn't my specialty. So I had a vague knowledge of Doc Holliday except that he was connected with Wyatt Earp and his gang in Tombstone. But when I read Tom Barnes' book, it helped me to understand the important role Doc Holliday had actually played in that town. I have some reservations about his alleged romance with his cousin, Mattie as I need to read a history book that would confirm it. But it was an enjoyable reading that took you out to the time of the Wild West."
5,Great book and very insightful,Very big fan of Doc Holliday. This book is a great portrayal of him and his life story going all the way back and through his Tombstone days.
4,"I enjoyed it and recommend it, but","Yes, I enjoyed this book. It provides another view of Doc, and the author is highly skilled.Yes. I do recommend it.Yet ""Doc Holliday: The Life and Legend"", by Gary L. Roberts is the definitive biography about Doc Holliday, a truly unique, remarkable man that had a way of finding trouble--or of trouble finding him--in an era that had a moral standard that just about didn't exist for many of the people of Tombstone.Buy ""Doc Holliday's Road to Tombstone,"" and buy the book mentioned above. You'll not regret either purchase, imho."
2,Not as advertised - it's more of an overpriced bibliography,"If you're looking for a historical expert's perspective of what a world in which the Nazi's won WWII would look like, you're not going to find it here. The book is basically a summary of alternate theories that have already been portrayed in a variety of media. Better to spend your time reading Amazon's suggestions on a ""other books like this one"" search."
2,Much too thin,"I have the 8"" model of this pan and I love it. But the 14"" model is about half the thickness, which is too thin for me so I sent it back. I like the size though, so I guess I'll have to continue looking."
1,Do not buy,"I too had problems of warpage after the first few uses. I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing this item. Cuisinart will replace it, but I need to pay postage and why replace with an inferior product. The seller is not getting back to me about a replacement, so I think I will have to eat this purchase."
5,Great product,"This skillet and the 12 inch as well, are everything I hoped they would be. They are heavy-duty, and cook evenly. More expensive than the ones I usually buy from Walmart, but will definitely outlast 3 or 4 of the cheaper ones. Actually, I don't expect to have to replace them."
5,GREAT skillet!,Great quality skillet! Love the large size and super easy to clean! Will be using this for many many many uses! I highly reccomend and worth every penny - especially with FREE shipping!
4,Me,"Nice skillet. It is designed well and works great. However, the test is to see how it performs after many uses and how long the nonstick surface lasts. But I will probably order a 10"" skillet as well."
5,Best non stick pan I've ever had!,"Bought the 12"" frying pan last week and like it so much that I am ordering the 8"" and the 10"" too. Made some eggs and they were perfectly cooked and slid right out of the pan. I really like the fact that it heats up with less energy, and if everyone used this type of pan, it would make a difference in the world! The pan is also light weight and easy for me to pour from. I usually struggle and get a sore wrist with a 12"" pan, but not wih this one. Another great thing is that there are no harmful chemicals that leach out while cooking. I did not like to use non-stick pans after I learned how dangerous some brands are. Now I am very comfortable using this brand. As usual, Cuisinart has produced a superior product!"
5,My favorite skillet!,I bought this pan about 6 months ago after reading about how it was much safer and healthier than the traditional non stick pans. I've been very happy with it. It is not quite as non stick as it was when I first purchased it but I noticed it became less non stick after leaving it on high heat for too long so maybe it was as much my fault as the pan's. i can still cook many things in it without a problem and if I'm cooking an egg I use a bare minimum of olive oil and it works great. I'm very happy with this pan and like the idea of it being a healthier alternative to the traditional non-stick pans.
1,non-non-stick,"At first, a thing of beauty. After about a year and a half of relatively light use, the magic is gone and everything sticks to this pan. It's pretty much useless."
3,"Light-weight, not for flat surface","Nice enough pan, especially for the price and size. It's very light and great that it's oven-safe. However, the bottom is not flat and so it does not sit on my flat-top stove well. Everything shifts to one side or the other. I have to return it because of that."
2,Cuisinart - CaCa,After 4-5 years of owning this is deteriorated and was recently replaced. I would not buy this product again.
1,Worst experience from a US company ever.,"This pan was a father's day present,. It arrived with a label stuck on the cooking surface that would not come off with any cleaning tool in the sink. Cuisinart was called and was no help except to say to use some odd preparation one is not likely to have on hand. When asked for the phone number for the Cuisinart legal office to register a serious complaint with possible class action consequences the agent hung-up. DO NOT BUY FROM CUISINART IS MY RECOMMENDATION. I would rate this a zero if I could. There are many alternatives including ALL CLAD non stick that are wonderful."
2,Nonstick sticks,I unpacked this highly recommended skillet and tried to cook a fried egg. It stuck to the skillet like glue. Be carefull with this one.
3,Not Cuisinart Quality,"I ordered this very large frying pan because I got the whole cuisinart set for Christmas, but I wanted a LARGE frying pan. The first time I used this pan, it stained on the frying surface.....like a burn mark. I was going to send it back, but I do like the size of this pan. So I've decided to keep it, but am disappointed in the flying surface.Amazon isn't selling this product anymore.....I wonder why???"
2,It was the wrong size,"Just a poor choice on my part. It was too large for my use. I was able to find an 11"" one by the same company."
2,very thin,The skillet is very thin and light weight and does not evenly distribute the heat. I would not purchase again.
5,A perfect pan,"Really happy about this pan. It is thick and solid, the handle is a sculpted hand-finished stainless steel casting that is attached to the pan with huge rivits that will never come loose. Much more than what I was expecting.Every company says their type of coating is better, but I thought Cuisinart's description made sense. So far it cleans up very easily and I don't see any problems with the coating. We don't attack it with sharp metal objects, but sometimes use them half-way carefully. This is all far better than a non-stick pan we bought maybe eight years ago. Technology marches on.The price seemed very reasonable when I bought it and really seems like a bargain when seen live and up close.Highly recommended, but of course I can't say if I would change my mind in, say, five years if it turned out all the coating fell off. It just doesn't seem like that will happen."
4,Great buy,"I bought this pan as a gift for my father and ended up buying one for myself the next week.The 12"" pan heat's very evenly and quickly. It also has a great non-stick surface. The manufacturer claims you can use metal utensils on this which I have not done yet, but will probably try at some point.I highly recommend purchasing one."
3,Cuisinart nonstick 14 inch skillet,Not as sturdy as I was hoping. It's too big - doesn't fit on normal burners and doesn't conduct the heat as evenly as it needs to for uniform cooking.
3,"great pan, but ...","This is an awesome pan. The only downside are the handle bolts. They are on the inside cooling surface and are not non-stick. When washing the pan, you have to scrub them to get the food off. Its hard to keep from scratching the adjascent non-stick surface"
2,"big, non-stick pan..not flat","This pan is big...really big, which is what we were looking for. We knew it would be a little bigger than our burners (which it is), but were okay with that. The problem we have with this pan, is that it doesn't sit flat on the stove. Which really doesn't help the whole cooking process. I would not buy this pan again."
4,Great size pan!,"So far, so good! Great size for larger recipes or several eggs at the same time. Pan has not shown any problems with sticking or scratching (it is still ""new"" though!). Helper handle is a great feature. Do wish it had come with a lid, but well worth Amazon's price!"
2,It's big... but not very sturdy,"I've had the 14-inch open skillet for over a month. It's a nice size which is what I was looking for. However I was also expecting Cuisinart quality. It's my first Cuisinart skillet, and it does not compare to Analon, Calphalon or Circulon. Haven't had issue with the nonstick surface (yet), but I did notice the non-stick surface has scratch marks already even though I do not use any metal utensils and it's always hand-washed. It's light but it appears to be flimsy. Noticed last week that one side was ""flatten"" like the pan was dropped on the ground. If it was dropped, it may have slipped out of my hands in the sink (few inches), not on the ground. The price was good for a 14-inch non-stick pan, but would not recommend this product."
2,Flimsy,This skillet is weighted unevenly due to the long handle and does not remain flat on the stove eye. It's very annoying to have to keep one hand on the short handle in order to get even heat distribution.
2,warped pan,"Bought this pan for its size. Non stick worked fine early on but the pan warped within 3 weeks of use(stovetop only) never super heated. Contacted customer support with a video of the rocking pan. They said send it to them for eval and possible replacement . $25 worth of shipping for a $40 pan, doesn't make much sense. I tossed the thing. Guess you get what you pay for. Just ordered the all clad."
5,Amazing non-stick pan!,"I've had my share of non-stick pans that have has the coating peel off, or lose their non-stick ability after a few months of use. This pan has become my workhorse from breakfast to dinner. Hamburgers, chicken parmigiana, creamed dried beef, fish sticks, chop suey -- they all cook well, slide right out of the pan, and a quick cleanup with a soapy sponge and the pan looks new and is ready to go again. Highly recommended."
1,Cheap material!!!!,"Every time I use this pan , no matter what heat setting it warps .Soon as any heat is applied it no longer sits flat on the burner !!! Very disappointed !!!!"
3,"Ok, but didn't keep it.","Bought this because I was looking for a larger fry pan. When it was delivered, it was a much thiner material than I was expecting so I returned it."
3,Good choice...way too small though!,"Had it for a few weeks, getting used to how things cook in it. I have an electric stove which, if i could afford a new one it would be gas and the electric one would get kicked to the curb! I bought the nine inch and that was a mistake. Not much you can make in one that small. Not sure what I was thinking!!! Has a good feel, and if all goes well will buy another, larger of course. All in all a good choice for the money."
1,Sticks terribly!,"I must have bought the one dud pan, since everyone else is rating these a 5. I paid around $70 for it, and it sticks just as badly as any scratched up, cheap old pan. I never used metal utensils and it's not scratched, but there's some kind of build-up in the middle that everything sticks to. I make scrambled eggs every day, and even when I use lot of butter, the eggs stick and burn and I feel like I'm actually wasting food. I did find scrubbers that are safe for so-called ""non-stick"" coating, so that makes cleanup easier - but I shouldn't have to scrub at all! I still use it every day since I paid so much for it, but I also have to scrub it clean every day."
2,Cuisinart 14 inch skillet,I was disappointed with the weight of the pan. Very light and the handle is a little loose. It is a nice size but not sure how long it is going to last. I would have liked to have known the weight before I purchased.
4,Good light weight skillet,I am happy with this skillet. It is light weight and has deep sides. I hope the non-stick holds up over time.
2,Dissatisfied,Nice large skillet but was disappointed that it does not work on my induction cooktop as it specified. Do not purchase if u have. An induction stove
3,This Pan Is a Must in My Kitchen,"The 3 star rating is for the inherent weaknesses of all nonstick skillets I have ever used: the surface will last a little more than a year, or less; the handle is sub par; and the skillet is too light and prone to warping. Among that group this one is a 5, hands down.The cooking surface is large and it will work in a 500 degree oven. I like it much better than any other nonstick skillet it's size.For everyday use I have 12"" Le Creuset, but there are some dishes that work best with a nonstick and this one is an excellent performer."
3,Green Gourmet 12 inch non-stick skillet,I bought this skillet and loved it. The non-stick was the best I have ever had I liked it so much I bought a 10 inch skillet also. But after 5 months of use it seems to have lost its non-stick ability. I hand washed the pan and have never put it in the dishwasher and now most everything sticks to it unless you use a lot of oil. I don't recommend this pan as it didn't last very long. Since it is such a large pan it didn't even get as much use as my others. Save your money and buy another brand.
2,I expected cheap but,I have long since stopped buying expensive non-stick cookware because the Teflon coating simply will not stand the test of time. So when I choose to buy non-stick I go for the cheaper manufactures and expect them to last only a few years. That is why I choose this product. The overall construction met my expectations. It's not heavy and the handle is firmly attached and should work well on a gas range.My problem with this product is the manufacturer applied a sticker smack dab in the bottom middle of the pan. Now we know all types of stickers over time become like glue when you try and remove them (even from a Teflon coated surface). Saddly I could not remove this sticker without scratching the Teflon coating and I was forced to return it.I would not buy again from this manufacturer.
1,Garbage,Not even close to flat on a glass cooktop.Very thin metal.It's a return or garbage item for sure.
1,Very thin. Poor conductivity,"This is a very thin pan, and with the acrylic cook-top we have it performs very very poorly. I wouldn't purchase this again. Heats very unevenly."
5,Fantastic Pan,"I bought this pan and have used it many times already. It heats evenly,browns well and is durable. I love this pan!! I bought the 10"" pan in the same Cuisinart line."
3,"Nice pans, but lose nonstick fairly quickly","Initially I was quite happy with the pan. They are good quality and cook evenly. The non-stick surface worked well.After about 6 months however the nonstick surface did not work very well any more. I wash them by hand, and only use plastic utensils to avoid scratching. I was disappointed by how quickly the nonstick surface was lost. I later looked on Consumer Reports, and found that they also say they have poor nonstick durability."
1,Don't waste your money,"Despite the bad reviews, I also tried this pan. It is awful - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!To address issues other have had -(1) It was perfectly flat out of the box, but warped as soon as medium heat was applied. Probably because it is so thin. Note the 10"" crepe pan weighs as much as this monster of a pan, and appears to be at least 3 times thicker.(2) It is way too thin to heat evenly - I think our heavy duty cookie sheets are just as thick! To check it out, I used an infrared thermometer and found out that once the hottest part of the pan reached about 350 (ideal for things like eggs and pancakes), there were parts that were 75 degrees cooler. This means burnt eggs and raw pancakes. Yum.The size would probably make a good chicken fryer for a large family, but it has no top, so I'm not sure what you really could do with it, so mine went back today."
4,Super,Like the rest of my cuisinart hard-anodized cookware this skillet is a pleasure to use. Makes cooking and cleanup a delight.
1,very disappointed!,"Upon recommendation from America's Test Kitchen, I purchased this pan. I am a good chef and know how to properly use a pan. Within a few uses this pan was scratched. I did not overheat the pan, nor did I use mental tongs to turn the meat. So, I am very disppointed with this pan. Also, for the record, I did not use excessive cleaners that would compromise the integrity of the pan. I do not recommend this pan at all."
1,Pan is not flat!!,"This pan sits so uneven on the stovetop that only less than half of the bottom contacts the stovetop and so food cooks terribly unevenly. If you have a ceramic or other electric non flame surface, the uneven cooking is worse cause there's no flame to bridge the break in contact. Andof course, oil pools on less than half the pan which makes it even more fun to use. I bought it as a gift and by the time I gave it and it was used, the refund time expired. My biggest issue with sellers in any situation is their lack of quality control - did they even for a second place the pan on a flat surface to see if it sits flat???? clearly not. And for a big name like Quisinart? They should be ashamed."
1,Big Uneven Pan....don't waste your money,"I'm giving this pan one star for it's size. I wanted a very large pan...and it is. However it does not sit flat on my stove top. I have a ceramic top stove...this makes for uneven cooking. The oil pools to one side of the pan. Don't waste your money!!!! Another reviewer mentioned this, but I was hoping their pan was a defect. Obviously the pan is just made uneven. Again, don't waste your money....my suggestion: look for the WearEver nonstick 12 inch skillet which was select best skillet by Cook's Illustrated. A little smaller, not quite half the price, and EVEN."
2,Hoping for a replacement from Cuisinart,"This past week I was cooking for my kids using one of my Cuisinart pans (Model #622-20 8"" skillet) which I generally enjoy and use daily. All of a sudden I hear a loud ""Pop"" from the pan. I knew immediately what the sound was. Several years ago, one of Cuisinart pan bolt covers blew off while I was cooking and just missed hitting me in the head. I thought that was a fluke and so have continued using your products. Now I realize it wasn't a fluke, there is a serious design and/or manufacturing issue with your pan bolts.I called the Cuisinart service desk and was invited to get my pan inspected by your team and consider for replacement (your tag #301-289-444) - but I have to pay postage both ways! That's about $20 postage and packaging to get considering for replacement of a $25 pan that has a dangerous flaw.I wish Cuisinart would stand behind its products, and I hope they can fix this dangerous flaw with their skillets."
2,Lifetime warranty! (You'll need it),"I'm on probably my 3rd or 4th unit. I continually send them in for replacement, because the coating wears off despite meticulous care.Cuisinart will tell you - do not heat higher than medium, do not use metal utensils, and do not place in the dishwasher. How you cook without going over medium is beyond me, but just be aware.I keep getting a replacement because, well, I can, but my next purchase won't be a Cuisinart. My Calphalon stuff seems to hold up a lot better. Actually, my cheap cast iron holds up better too....:^)"
3,Surface Scratches,"Good heat conduction and nice even cooking. However, even though I strictly use non-metal utensils, the non-stick surface of the pan now has visible scratch marks (after only about 3 weeks of use). I have only cleaned the pan with a sponge, so I am at a loss as to why the non-stick surface was designed so poorly as it clearly lacks a sufficient degree of durability."
5,Use it Constantly!!,Good quality pan. Great for that 1 egg or quick little saute. Hard finish . I put it in the dishwasher although I'm not sure that's correct.
1,warps and lost its non-stick,"this pan has warped severely and has lost some of its non-stick features. It was always hand washed, never used on high heat and is only 2 yrs old."
4,Cuisinart Chef's Classic 10 in. open skillet,It is everything I wanted. Seems to be sturdy except the bottom scratches easily. Should last for years. I find it to be better than the Cephalon that I already have. Much lighter to handle.
2,Eggs and pancakes will stick,"This should be a $19.99 pan sold at Target to college kids. I was not able to cook an over-medium egg on it without using oil. I was not able to cook a pancake on it. The pan I received was not a non-stick pan. It was more like ""stick resistant"".For the same money, I purchased the Calphalon 10 and 12 inch pan combo set. The construction was similar although the non stick coating was different. I was able to cook an egg and a pancake on the Calphalons with no issues. So, 2 pans instead of 1 for the same money, and they have a better coating? No brainer.The quality was mediocre. I was replacing a 9 year old Calphalon which had 3 rivets on handle, this had 2. It was thin and too light. I could not rate how evenly the heat was distributed because I couldn't get the egg off the bottom of the pan."
3,Not a long term purchase,"This pan was ok for about 6 months. After that, the non-stick coating started to come off. Also, I think it says it is scratch resistant. It is not."
5,We love Jesse Bear,"My son really enjoys the Jesse Bear books and this is another great one about Jesse Bear and Christmas time. I really like the fact that this story is not just about the night before or the day of, but the entire season. This book is a great choice for kids ages 3-5, or older kids who might not have the attention span to sit for longer stories."
4,New Album from one of Australia's least liked rock bands,"I have been a Front End Loader fan since way back when. Their out n' out rock n' roll, coupled with the dryest sense of humour across the land, have endeared me to them since their 2nd album 'Let's Ride' and the follow-up 'Last of the V8 Interceptors'. Album after album, they release probably the most underrated, foot stomping rock n' roll that any lesser band would be immensly proud of. The fact that they have been (criminally) overlooked in the Aussie rock music scene doesn't hide the fact that they keep coming up trumps. Bow Campbell has one of the most distinctve, powerful rock voices around; Pete Kostic keeps the rhythm that F.E.L. absolutely depend on, in check, Richie is so tight on the bottom end and Davis....well, he's Davis! The new album, again, [beats] anything else released by so-called rock bands the world over. Do yourself a favour and pick this one up - you won't be disappointed."
5,Aussie Rock!!!,"I didn't really know much about Front End Loader until about a month ago when I saw them live twice opening for another Aussie band - Grinspoon. They were absolutely brilliant! I went and bought this album straight away and it's easily one of the best cds released in 2002. There isn't a single song that I dislike on the whole cd. They're an amazing live band as well, and I pity anyone who will never get the chance to see them."
4,Actually...............,"Actually the hit song ""Send me a lover"" performed by celine Dion, is not just on this CD it is also on ""Women for Women, Vol. 2"" So pick that one up too!"
4,Works,"I've only use this sifter a couple of times after recently receiving it; for the most part, it gets the job done.The handle is a little too small for my liking. If I have more than 1 cup of flour in it, the wire creating the loop that pushes the flour through the sifter moves a bit, making cranking a little difficult. This is upsetting since the capacity of the sifter is 3 cups. Also flour escapes through the little holes on the side where the wire comes out but I guess this can't be helped."
5,Easy and quick to use,"I love this sifter. I have one that is the one hand, handle pump kind and it always seemed to take forever. I love the easy quick crank and it is holding up well so far!"
5,Stone Cold Ether,"Amazing music, every track, from beginning to end. If you're not up on your Babble Lore, you may not know that they did the music for 3 of the songs on Traci Lords, 1000 Fires album. (Juno Reactor & Mike Edwards also appear on that album) If you like Babble, find Traci's CD - it will be well worth the search. I've got some Babble re-mix albums as well, and those too, are incredible - though very hard to find. Bablyon!"
5,Its wonderful to find music that surprises me!!!,"This is a great album, so moody, so full of emotions. I recommended it so very much, but most of all I recommend their first album ""the stone"", that is what I call a masterpiece. Everybody wants it, down here."
4,Ethereal Pop,"Fans of the 80s pop group The Thompson Twins may be surprised to hear the musical progress of the very talented Tom Bailey and Alannah Currie. Having relocated to New Zealand and formed this new,decidedly non-mainstream band, their new efforts deserve a new audience. The music on this collection, particularly the haunting ""Just like You"" and ""Hold the Sky"", is ethereal and moody, reflecting spiritual and cultural changes away from the Euro-trash oriented tunes from their 80s efforts. Fans of Dead Can Dance: give this CD a try."
4,The drug dealers get robbed! Imagine that!,"This movie is filled with action which all stems from the robbery of a crack house. Unfortunately for these robbers, the drug dealers don't call the police when they get robbed. They call a hitwoman who goes after each one of them to get the money back. It's an interesting story that moves and you won't get bored."
5,peppercorn spice gind,"This product is a good take on whole corn pepper spice. It is a bit heavy on the black pepper (India), but can keep your potency and flavor for your fine taste needs at a applicable pricing scale."
1,"Bad lens, OK filters",The 2x and wide angle lens are not worth the money--blurry around the edges. I wrote to the supplier and told them that and got no response. The filters are ok--at least they produce pictures that are not distorted. I wouldn't buy this brand again.
5,Works Great!,Product arrived on time and was as described.It fit my vacuum cleaner and works great.It definitely helped having a new filter installed.
1,misrepresented- did not send item in photo,"I requested and paid for an HF-9 as shown in the photo. what I got was not a Eureka HF9 but a collection of no-name pieces in a bag that made up, maybe ??, an equivalent of a real HF-9. No more filter purchases from Amazon or this vendor."
4,Vacuum filter,Was what I needed to fit my vacuum and was far cheaper than buying it at a local store. I purchased the value pack which gave me 4 other small filters with the hepa filter for what I was going to pay for just the hepa alone.
5,Perfect!,"Had my doubts for the price but NO loss in image quality and protects my lens, very satisfied! I have not noticed any flare from this filter but I also always use a lens hood when I'm in the sun. Bottom line quality build great price!"
3,no change in pics,"doesn't seem to make any difference in my outside photos, but i do appreciate the added protection"
4,lens filter,This is a very good filter. I had a B+W filter that broke when a friend dropped my camera. I decided to try this Canon filter and I am impressed by its performance.
3,Horrible - smeared and smuged out of the box,"i've bought this one for my canon 200mm f/2.8L II ...althought sharpness has not suffered.. flare has ... which buggs me alot..i also would like to point out that when i took the filter out of its package.. it had smears and oily smudges on it... and that really pissed me off..update: i'v just purchased a B+W 77mm filter from BHPhoto for another lens. now that i can compare the canon with the B+W i can easily see that the B+W is superior, the canon one causes way more glare than the B+Wi'm throwing aweay my canon filters and replace them with B+W ..very disappointed.."
5,UV Haze,Protedtion is the most important use but the clarity and quality are important too. this is a very good filter. I have never had a bad product from Canon.
2,Get the Hoya,"I got this filter based on the reviews here to protect my Nikkor 18-200. I feel disappointed with this filter for 2 reasons: (1) it came with light scratches (obviously used), (2) it produces internal reflections (it is not multicoated) -- when pointed at the light, a strong flare develops. (From what I read about coatings, multicoated filters produce a green reflection of a light source, filters with few coatings produce a faint reflection and uncoated filters have a bright reflection -- this filter shows a pretty distinct reflection that is not green). I returned this filter and got a Hoya 72mm UV HMC filter. Much better. Occasional flare can be seen (I guess this is the price of protecting your lens), but it is *significantly* better than the Canon filter. My recommendation is to get the Hoya filter for a little more - it is worth it. (One drawback of the Hoya was it was much more difficult to screw onto the lens.) Happy picture taking."
2,Worked well until I tried to clean it,"This filter did its job admirably for nine months. After that time, I noticed some film/gunk buildup on the front of it. I took the filter off the lens and used distilled water and a cloth to clean it using very light pressure.After cleaning it, there were tiny scratches all over the surface of the filter. So cleaning the filter ruined it.I'll try buying the Hoya filter and see if that holds up better. A product like this certainly shouldn't be scratched into unusabilty the first time you clean it."
2,You get what you pay for,"If you want a NICE UV/Haze filter, you'll need to spend some money. This $17 filter is not worth the materials used to build it. Sadly, the only Canon UV/Haze filter that's ever proved to be a winner is the L39 Sharp Cut versions which I've only seen in 77mm. This is junk."
4,6-PACK Beef Pill Pockets,"Our border collie and cocker spaniel both love these Pill Pockets, making giving pills no hassle at all! However, the Pill Pockets come in three sizes and I find that the LARGE pockets tend break up in pieces in the bag. They can be smooshed together to use, so there is no loss. The small and medium size Pockets tend to retain shape better and accomodate most pills. I would only use the LARGE size if you have some unusually large tablet or capsule to administer to your pet."
5,6 pk. beef pill pockets large,Product was exactly what I was looking for at a very reasonable price and with reasonable shipping. Even with shipping it was cheaper than I could get it locally.
5,DOGS LOVE IT!!!,"Before using this product it was a challenge and not pleasant giving my dogs their pills, I have 3. I tried peanut butter, wrapping them in cheese or meat, I even tried that pill tub that was suppose to help. With pill pockets my dogs love it and can't wait for another pill. It's nice very pleasant and quick to give them their pills now. I wouldn't question getting this and using it to give them their pills (derm caps, or just about anything) with ease. I HIGHLY recommend this product and I would never go back."
4,"Jet JWBS-12OS 12"" Open Stand Band Saw","Unit came well packaged. (Styrofoam, plastic bags, etc.) Assembly was easy due to excellent manual. Fit and finish is excellent. For a 12"" the saw is extremely well built, heavy duty and eye appealing. The mirror-like cast iron table looks as good now as it did two years ago. The saw runs very quiet and performs well. If you're looking for a quality 12"" band saw, this is the one to buy."
2,"Not Price, Horsepower","I was not surprised to see the finish of the saw when I took it out of the box. I set it up in no time but reality of a 350 dollar saw set in when I tried to resaw 3/4 in piece of oak. Changed the blade to a 1/2 in 3tpi but still no power. If it were a Mustang I would install a supercharger. ""All show, no go"". Pay the extra money and get one more powerful."
1,Very disappointing,"I've owned the Jet 12"" opend stand band saw for about a year now and have had nothing but trouble with it. I find it almost impossible to keep proper tension on the blade. It's either coming loose and allowing the blade to wander or its throwing the rubber treads off the upper and lower wheels. My sense is that this is strictly a ""hobby saw,"" capable of handling only thin stock. My problems always arise when I'm cutting stock 3"" or more in thickness. The disappointment is that I spent $... more than I would have to buy the low-end Delta, but am not getting anything more in performance. My advise is to either buy a cheap 10"" or pay ...[more]+ for a 14"", but avoid this overpriced disappointment."
4,browsing through bandsaws,"I feel this 12"" bandsaw Model 708901 would be the right one for me though I would like to know more about it in terms of: BLADE TYPES, PURPOSES OF DIFFERENT BLADES (widths & teeth count), length of blades and availability. I saw no reference to what was being used on this model nor for that matter, replacement costs. Would someone please look into this and drop me a line so I can further my review.Respectfully. Kermit"
5,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!!,"Oh my. I have never owned a Jim Reeves recording before and this tops all my other music. What an absolutely beautiful, smooth voice. Every song he sings is wonderful. This collection is perfect and I can't believe I lived 55 years without him in my house! I will spend the next 55 listening to this CD! Wonderful!"
5,Bought this for my mom,"Jim Reeves was a huge favorite of my mom's. So when she was in the hospital, I wanted to find some of his music to play for her. So glad Amazon had this in the MP3 library...thanks Amazon!"
5,Memories,I Love this album. My mom listened to these songs when I was a kid. It brought back great memories.
5,Part Two of a very easy order,"Everything from setting up an account, to ordering, purchase, and delivery was so easy. Was very surprised at the quality of sound on both Jim Reeves and the Webb Pierce CD's. Have ordered two more ""older"" CD's for Fathers Day. Now I will have to start looking at and ordering CD's from ""my era"" - the 70's."
5,Will be watching this in the future and remembering the past.,The Time machine tour covers a large portion of This Delicate Thing We've Made album and a few of his Tension and the Spark album. Giving the whole concert a dark them with a light at the end.
5,Not to miss.....,"For any Darren Hayes fan, this DVD is a must! It has proven to be some of Darren's best work!"
1,amazon & The Time Machine Tour,i am very disappointed that on Australian site with Australian address that Amazon offering doesn't default to providing Region 0 DVD format Time Machine Tour - Darren Hayes - so i can play on my iMac..
4,It is What you expect,"It's as good as Darren is in concert. The best thing,So Beautiful,I want you, and Afirmation are the only Savage Garden songs represented....so if you are looking to see SG hits by the SG live dvd(which is even better than this). However if you are a big fan of his latest solo effort than this dvd will not dissapoint."
4,Great Mugs,"I bought these mugs for a present. Person received them loved them & used them immediately. Just the right size for coffee & tea. Great honey color. Would give 5 stars but after 1-2 years, white inside does discolor from black coffee."
3,A few fun party games.,"I was thrilled to find this in a used book store because I like to throw historically themed parties and it can be difficult to find appropriate games. Many of the party games described in this little book (like ""The Rainbow Labyrinth"" and ""Order Out of Chaos"") are easily enjoyed by modern partygoers. I was disappointed that about half of the games were variants of ""fill in the blank"" stories with prescribed answers that don't seem very fun at all. There is also a game that requires each guest to have an Indian-head penny, which might be difficult now. It is a fun piece of nostalgia and offers a few entertainments that would make for a jolly party today."
5,Excellent resource for families dealing with a death.,"I used this book with my own 5 and 2 year old when my mom died, and have sent it as a gift and recommended it several times to other families since then; would be useful I'd say to kids even as old as 10. Also would be useful in a family facing a terminal illness. Lovely gentle story, doesn't contradict any particular religious beliefs that I could see, but leads into further discussions. Highly recommended."
5,excellent,"Incredible guitar work, solid rhythm, mesmerizing sound, this is post-hardcore at its best. Do not let the word hardcore confuse you though, this is not a race among the band members as to who is going to finish the song first while being the loudest. This is a clear and orderly indie rock rhythm, intelligent and original sounding punk the way it's meant to be. If you liked Moss Icon you'd be smart enought to get this before all your music-savvy buddies get it (and there won't be too many because this is too smart for the masses)."
4,Ridiculously Good.,"Anything & everything these guys do has just been stupendous. I could be mistaken - but I want to say that this was another brilliant band that Steve Albini help produce. I could be thinking about ""The Great Unraveling"" though, which is another great band by the way."
5,GREAT VALUE...ONE SIDED DVDS!!!,"This set contains 1/2 of the listed episodes on the 20 dvd package featuring the same cover artwork from Brentwood. However, if you're like me and prefer your stuff on a single-sided disc then you will be happy with this set. I strongly recommend this set. Most episodes are extremely watchable on pretty good transfers. I really don't think that there is a better value out there (quality wise) for fans of old Dragnet (the b&w; stuff) episodes. AND IT'S ON 2 ONE-SIDED DVDS!!!!!!Buy & enjoy!!!"
4,Price and Quanity,These objects were the most fun for my daughters to play with and held up with my five year old. She usually breaks every thing that she touches but my this. I found it to be a very surdy and inexpensive prodect.
5,A cool playset for girls,First I bought the barbie with the baby and like it so much that I asked my mother to buy me the dr. barbie weeks later my father bought me the nursery. I like so much to spend time playing with my dolls while my mom is at work.María Margarita
3,"The radio is good, but the instructions stink.","I had the radio sent to a relative in college so I had to help get the radio working by ""remote control"". I had to call the manufacturer to get additional information.What the product description above doesn't tell you (and the manual seemed unclear about to my relative) is: This radio uses a 9V battery, The switch to change the weather radio stations is inside the battery compartment.Since the radio has been up and running there have been no operational complaints. The radio has received the weekly tests just fine."
4,Wonderful!,"I first purchased this book 10 years ago under the title, "" The Spiritual Seeker's Guide"". Once I found what I was searching for, I sold the book at a yard sale. Since then I have purchased two more copies for a friend and a family member, because I told them how informative this was in giving basic beliefs and histories to the many different religions. Now I am buying a third copy to keep for myself, in case I should ever want to lend it out. I had difficultly tracking this down.. the author has since updated the material, and changed the title of the book. This is great for plain & simple basics."
5,"Impressive, Honest, Truthful!","This book is perfect for the spiritual seeker. It gives you a good overview of all the religions and perhaps insightas to why we are where we are in the world today. I have read Mr. Sadleirs bio, which is quite impressive, and feel this is a must read for everyone with an open mind. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.Self-realization: An Owner-User Manual for Human Beings"
5,a must-read!,"I love this book and I highly recommend it! It is a fantastic account of years of research of every religion known. Steven Sadlier along with book research actually personally met with the people of each faith, went to their services, understood what they are about. The years and decades this process took him is actually a gift to all of us readers who can finally just pick up a book and visit to all these places with him! Extraordinary!"
5,Looking For God: A Seeker's Guide to Religious and Spiritual Groups of the World,"This is a simple, honest and thorough guide for the growing number of spiritual seekers in the world. It gives an inside look and understanding of many different religions and spiritual paths. Steven Sadlier is one of the most dedicated, honest and clear spiritual teachers I've come across in my 40 years on my own ""looking for God"" Journey. Any serious or beginning student on the path should include this thorough easy to read guide as part of their ""work"". I have bought several copies and given them out to friends. It's a nice gift for beginner's and an introduction to a Western Modern Day, Spiritual Master. A good Read."
3,shows that the boys could do more than just slapstick,This Abbott & Costello flick shows you that they could do more than just slapstick. Lou Costello shows in this movie that he could tug at your heart strings. He had a natural ability to make you feel sorry for him in the same way that Charlie Chaplin had. It is a shame that his life was cut short before he could develop that characteristic more.
3,Only about four worthwhile songs,"I bought this CD because Dru Hill was included in the line-up. I probably should've just purcahsed his CD. A couple of songs really rock, but the rest of it was disappointing. Song 2,3,and 4 are all I listen to on the disc. Think about this investment first!"
4,Good Album,"Def Jam's ""Rush Hour Soundtrack"" is an almost perfect soundtrack album. It has a skit every now and then, that was tooken from the movie. The song by Too Short is amazing, and Can I Get A? buy Jay-Z is also good. It also has a song from Westcoast gangster rappers Daz Dillinger & Big Tray Dee. I gave it a 4 star all because of the first 2 songs. EVERY other song on this album is awesome, a hip hop masterpeice."
2,Something's Missing Here,"Rush Hour is a great movie! The Soundtrack however is something I could do without! The biggest song in the movie is Edwin Starr's ""War."" Not only is it played countless times, but it is even referred to by Chris Tucker in the dancing scene. But for some reason it did not make it to the soundtrack! This is unfortunate because had it been on the soundtrack...it would've easily been the best song on this CD! True there are one or two decent pieces on here...but if you're in it for a song or two, resort to Napster!"
1,a sountrack must have the songs of the films,"i found this movie great, of course, i'm a chan fan. i also like some songs and music of the film so i decide to buy this album. the surprise is that i don't found a lot of songs, the worst thing is that the songs that appear don't reflect the movie feeling. what's that of def jam? always the same, a poor hiphop, without strong, without heart, always the same. there are many songs or just one very long? i hate this cd, this is not a sountrack is another bad-defjam-album. SOUNDTRACK, music of a movie! if you like the music of the movie connect your taperecorder to your vhs and just record the sound, believe me."
2,"Ok, but not the best","it was pretty disappointing. i don't mind bad language, but it was way to much, like every other word was a swear. the only really good song is ""Can I Get A . . ."" the rest are pretty bad. the clips from the movie are really funny, though. overall, it's a waste of money"
4,The Christ Myth,"Dead Little Fish is a meticulously researched exploration into the origins of Jesus Christ. It lays to rest any notions that Christ was an actual person, instead clearly showing how events from his life were adopted from pre-existing myths. An excellent read."
4,Money well spent.,"This is my first 'Cornershop' album. Great blend of classical Indian music, Bhangra and Alternative music. Finally Punjabi comes mainstream (or close to it). Favorate tracks: Jullandar Shere and Jansimran King."
2,Just OK...,"We received the drum set in before xmas as promised but purposely did not build it since it was from Santa till the night before... It had no instructions, and a google turned up enough instructions for a fundamental setup. The seat was torn and a few of the bass drums latches would not screw in no matter what we tried since, I believe, they were not long enough... It was for a 6 year old so we found ways around our problems but there should have been no problems with better parts and planning fromt he company."
1,By far the worst I've ever read.,"I have read hundreds of true crime books. I have until now, never actually considered demanding the author give me my money back! I would send him his book back if it wouldn't cost more than the book did. More than focusing on the story line I found myself ""catching"" all the mistakes in his grammer. The idea and the story seemed interesting but I just couldn't keep track. When I did finally finish the book I was more mad that I paid money for it. This is one to borrow but not pay for. If you'd like to practice your english skills, this ones for you. Maybe Bill's editor was too busy to edit this one. The pics didn't match the story either. Hope he has better luck with his next book."
5,FIRST TO GO. LAST TO KNOW.,"I served as a mopic during that goddamned war. This flick rings so true. It made me laugh and cry and wish I knew nothing about what happened over there.Welcome home, brothers!"
1,Don't Believe The Hype!,"What a major disappointment this was. After reading all reviews and deciding to fork over $12.00 for a used VHS copy.......I somewhat expected a ""classic"" on line with Platoon or DeerHunter. I will agree that this movie had a low budget....and it does show. The ""battle scenes"" amounted to little more than something a bunch of kids could do in the woods behind their homes. I can't believe that Leonard Maltin gave this movie 3 stars in his movie review book. The movie failed to convince me that this was taking place in 1969....Jungles of Vietnam. Nothing realistic about this failed ""war"" movie. This movie is only worth a price of .99 to 1.99."
5,84 Charlie MoPic great complement to The Things They Carried,"When I taught high school English Literature I showed ""84 Charlie MoPic"" to students as a visual complement to the novel ""The Things They Carried"" by Tim O'Brien. The film works great with the novel because there are things/ideas that you can identify in the film that are discussed in the book (e.g., some of the superstitions of soldiers).When I first saw MoPic I had tuned into a PBS airing after it had already started and believed it was actual footage for most of the film. I would try to replicate the feeling (and in a way pay homage to the film maker's efforts at versimilitude) by starting the film with the number countdown and deflecting their questions about ""is this real?"" until our subsequent discussion.I highly recommend both ""84 Charlie MoPic"" and ""The Things They Carried"" individually and paired together."
2,84 charlie mopic,"I really thought this was the worst movie i have ever seen. Almost as bad as the blair witch project. I thought the attention to detail was good, but i think the whole idea of the camera man , following the infantry around asking questions, making noise, i personally would have tried to kill the mopic, to save my plattoons lives. I dont understand how this movie got so many good reviews. Almost half of my history of the vietnam war class got up and left ten minutes into this movie. I think it had to do with the fact that just prior to watching this movie, we got to watch the CBS News footage of vietnam, the real thing. So this movie had a tough audience, so i still think it is worth watching. Also, the fact that they filmed it in california didn't help the jungle effect either."
4,84 Charlie Mopic,"I have only seen this film once, in the small hours on Channel 4.It is a classic.For years I looked for it in video stores in Scotland to no avail.It's here and I now intend to buy it. A must for any War movie collection."
2,Buy the Book instead,"Good basic book on Horse Race Betting. However, the charts, graphs and illustrations are not suitable for Kindle Fire. They are unreadable. I should have bought the book and not download the Kindle Version."
2,"For donors at the track, not winners...","There's very little in this book you couldn't learn from one of the free PDF downloads on the Daily Racing Form website. It's an introduction to what happens in and around the track that doesn't help you at all with learning how to handicap. Strictly lowest common denominator stuff, nothing that will help you think for yourself at the track.You'd be better off picking up a copy of Brad Free's brilliant Handicapping 101 instead-- This one falls far below the usual Dummies standards."
3,Kindle e-reader not so good. The paperback is better.,"Bought this book awhile ago, loaned it out, never got it back. Can't recommend Kindle the ebook is not easy to read or use. The paperback version is better. This is more like an encyclopedia, educational approach to horse racing. More for advanced beginners and experienced players and not for true beginners or ""dummies"" it's way too much to absord for that level.Eng did a good job gathering almost everything about the sport imaginable. In my opinion he just could have laid it out beginning to end a lot better. Lots and lots of bouncing around and using the index to find what you want to read.He should update the book with larger print and use more current examples from the Racing Form. All told it is a pretty good reference book.Kindle 2 Stars. Paperback 4 Stars."
5,Great Reference!,"I always love these ""For Dummies"" books because they are written so that you really can understand the subject matter. This one is no exception. It's not a book that I would sit and read cover to cover, although I did read the first two chapters like that, but I've found it to be especially useful in looking up terms, or specific questions. The ""quick tips"" in the margins are great. I use a highlighter when reading, so that it's especially easy to go back to a particular subject of interest. I would recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn more about how to bet the horses."
2,Nice beginner book,This is a good primer for someone very new to the game. I would suggest Handicapping 101 by Brad Free as a better choice. I expected a bit better from Mr. Eng as he is certainly a respected and knowledgable handicapper. He may have been limited by the publisher.
3,Good book for beginners but nothing great!,"I would recommend the following 3 books for the horse handicapper after reading this one:These are in no particular order, but all very helpful in my opinion.1.The Horse Racing Guide to the Galaxy - B&W; Edition The Kentucky Derby - Preakness - Belmont: The must have Thoroughbred Race Track Handicapping & Betting Book for Beginners.2.Beyer on Speed: New Strategies for Racetrack Betting3.Win Every Race: A Never Before Seen Wagering System Dedicated to Any Kind of Horse Racing (Alternate Cover)and don't forget to use the ""Gambling Advantage"" listed inGA is for Bitches - Volume #1 Sports Betting Guide B&W; Version: The must have Sports Betting Guide for the Winningly Challengedto really improve your overall bottom line. It really does work!"
2,Not what I hoped,"I had an old copy of the Steiff Sortiment and this sounded much like it. It wasn't even close.Very few pictures of the different animals. No real price guides. Pretty much a waste of time.If you can afford it, find a copy of the Steiff Sortiment."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I am a fan of Frances Ray. I enjoyed her story, but Ms. Reid's story should not have been included in this book. I thought it was the worst thing that Ray could have done, to allow her story to be published in the same book. That story was so degrading!!!!!"
5,"Sweet, hot and delicious!!","I especially loved ""Chocolate Kisses"",the last erotic tale. Each tale made me have a ""sweet"" tooth & want more of these delicious tales. The characters were steamy and great fun to read."
4,Worth trying,"First when I ordered this product I thought it was the smaller Kegal balls. These were a nice bit bigger than I first origional intended while placing my order, definately not for the ammature. But once you start using them and get use to the size, they are great, you can swear them anywhere at anytime and I feel my muscles tightening which is great. If you haven't tried any of these balls before I would suggest betting a smaller ball to start off with before entering into these bigger balls."
4,She seems to like them,"First off, they are way bigger then expected, so check out the diameter before you buy. My Fiancee is small in that area so they were a little difficult for her to get in, but they ended up working. She seems to like them other then that, but nothing amazing. they are good, and if you can find them cheap i would suggest them."
1,Don't buy,Missing Ben Wa Balls in shipment ... They don't send everything as advertised! Items are a bit cheap for the price but more important they don't give you everything promised!
1,mmmm... not satisfied.,"Overall I was dissatisfied with this product. The balls were much to big to be able to work the kegal muscles what so ever. Sorry, but I guess I just need the .5 Inch size balls and I wish I hadn't spent the 5 dollars in shipping :("
2,Ever seen a snake treading water?,"Saints and Sinners will go down as being the worst of the old Whitesnake (Slip of the Tongue being the worst of the new, i.e. post Slide It In). It was 1982 and the rock world was boring...hard for anyone to come up with anything exciting, so Mr. Coverdale can be forgiven. Shortly afterwards he fired everyone except I think Jon Lord and started anew, resulting in the much better Slide It In period."
2,NO WONDER ....,"No wonder Coverdale recorded again the tracks "" CRYIGN IN THE RAIN"" and ""HERE I GO AGAIN"" in his smash hit album WHITESNAKE ( 1987 ). These are the only two worthwhile songs in this album. But, for US$ 6,97, you may buy it..."
4,Rock n Swagger,"I really enjoyed this album. While it is a little on the bluesy side, I rather consider that a good thing. Whitesnake were a blues/rock band before the late 80s conversion to more straight edge rock. The strongest track on the disc is 'Victim of Love' IMO as it really accentuates David Coverdale's voice. Of course 'Young Blood', 'Crying in the Rain', 'Here I go Again'and 'Saint an Sinners' are also strong tracks.Whitesnake has always been unique to me as it exsists solely to accentuate the very powerful voice of David Coverdale, no matter the incarnation it is always the vocals that stand out. Saints & Sinners is no different in that regard."
4,Saints and Sinners (1982),"Whitesnake's Saints and Sinners came out two years before their first big U.S. hit Slide it In. Saints and Sinners is of special interest because two songs off of Saints and Sinners would latter resurface on Whitesnake's 1987 self-titled release. Both Crying in the Rain and Here I Go Again were rerecorded for Whitesnake's 1987 album, with a few changes in lyrics on Here I Go Again. It's a shame this band didn't make years earlier."
3,ex PURPLE voice is back again,"I don't think that Coverdale tried to copy Robert Plant Zeppelin style. That is untrue, he only tried to combinate the Zep and Purple sound as best as he could, the result is Whitesnake. The whole songs are cool,....include the early versions of HERE I GO AGAIN & CRYING IN THE RAIN. buy this cd without any prejudice feeling."
2,"AVERAGE, BUT VERY IRREGULAR","This CD is good, but it shows lack in rpoduction (even being produced by ""master"" Martin Birch) and the quality of songs are very irregular. Of course we can see clearly Coverdale's amazing rockin voice."
3,not bad,"this album was old, but especially the earliest versions of Crying in the rain and here I go again,...I like the Whitesnake early line up with jon lord and Ian paice."
4,Needs To Be Louder,"Musically speaking this cd is fairly good. My only complain is that the sound output is very low. In my car stereo the volume level of 7 is reasonably loud, but not to pearcing loud. Whenever I play songs from the ""Gold"" and ""Good To Be Bad"" cds that's the level i use. I made a mix from those two cds and from ""Saints & Sinners"" and whenever a song from ""Saints"" came on I had to turn the volume up to 9 so that it will be on the same level as the other songs. It just annoys me when there is a huge disparity in the level of sound output whenever I make a mix. I like all the songs to be at a equal sound level so I won't have to keep messing with the volume control. Anyways it is just my hang up."
2,"`Ran' A plus, `Goodbye Boys' F minus","Both of these films are foreign adaptations of Western culture. `Goodbye Boys' is a Malaysian version of the Boy Scouts of America complete with typical American teenage pranks. Somehow, I got the feeling that whoever did the subtitles in the video tried to make it appear that these boys were no different from American youths. Yet, the actor's body language did not match that of the subtitle. The movie didn't appear to be credible to me and I became bored very fast. It isn't worth the shipping and handling charge. If you must see it, rent it.*Whereas, `Ran' is a Japanese samurai adaptation of a Shakespeare play `King Lear' that was faithful to their culture. It kept me glued to the couch throughout the entire movie. Put your money on `Ran' and you won't regret it whereas you will with `Goodbye Boys' and your money."
3,Wrong,I ordered this tps for my 1987 jeep Cherokee I have Manuel tranny. I think the one they sent was for auto trans. The arm was backwards. When I ordered it nothing was said about tranny. So if you order this tps beware of tranny
3,probably exciting if....,"This is the first ""hiding out in Berlin during the Holocaust"" book you have read. Otherwise, not so much. On the positive side, it gave me perspective by showing more than one story- on the negative, hard to keep track of all the people."
5,A Marvelous Guide to Paradise,"Having lived for 6 years on the Florida Gulf Coast, I find Ms Reiley's Guide is something of a delight to one plagued with what to show the next out-of-towner, or what to see myself that might be new and refreshing. The book is admirably terse, factually impeccable, and covers in good detail a considerable portion of the Paradise of the West Coast of Florida. The clear prose is peppered with Ms Reiley's reactions to people, places, and things, some which she clearly enjoyed, others of which failed to meet her mark. Her language delights this aging Sophist, while staying within the bounds of good taste. The black and white photos well illustrate the text. The maps are too small for driving, but large enough to help find the desired location.A simply delightful guide to Paradise"
5,This is a FUN travel guide,"Here are the people who will love this book: Those who think Florida is paradise and those who are dubious about the whole Florida thing. People who live in the Florida Gulf Coast region and those who have never been there. People whose passion is watching birds or catching fish and those who prefer indoor activities. People planning a vacation and those looking for a great gift. Adventurous types and those who enjoy reading about far-away places from the couch. People traveling with kids. Couples. People traveling alone. This travel guide starts like a novel and is way better written, much more opinionated, and has lots more personality than any other travel series I've used. It's a really fun book to read."
3,Not Her Best,"PD James' work almost always is richly detailed and layered with compelling intrigue. Those hallmarks are in this book, but here also she tries to be topical (the nuclear issue) and it detracts somewhat from the more interesting elements of the mystery. Moreover, the characters just aren't that interesting."
3,Not P D James's best,"The book was initially slow but I kept reading because I know how very good P D James is. Soon enough I was sucked into the story, and kept wondering who'd done it. But as I discovered the story underneath, I was a bit disappointed. Some of it was hard to believe, and too concocted to accept; new material that I as a reader could never have begun to think.A good mystery should give a few clues here and there during the beginning when the characters and story are set up so that when all is revealed she feels the Aha! Wow! moment. While I was not able to guess the murderer, the back story made this book fall from 5 stars to 3."
5,book lover,"Very good! It kept me guessing ""who done it"" until the very end and I still was surprised. Lots of twists and turns in the plot but easy to stay with all that's happening."
3,Absorbing but ultimately unsatisfying,"This is the first P.D. James novel I've read and initially I shared the positive reaction of most reviewers here-- the writing was absorbing, the characters well drawn, and the overall atmosphere compelling. Putting her usual detective in a different position than lead investigator was an interesting and unusual touch. Ultimately, however, James didn't appear to know where to go with the story and threw too many extraneous and unconvincing twists into the plot. So all in all an enjoyable read, but not a memorable one."
2,I didn't like it,"There were far too many suspects in this book! And I really thought that most of the innocent suspects had much more motive to commit the murder than the person who actually did it. The ending was very weak...I felt let down by the criminal. And the Norfolk coast seems like a sordid little world that I wouldn't want to visit, let alone live there. I didn't care for most of the characters and I found that I didn't really care who the murderer was by the time the book finally ended. A waste of time...I got rid of the book after I read it."
1,Unlikable Characters,"It seems as if every woman in the book is insecure, unstable and doesn't like other women. The character I would like to see eliminated was a hostile teenaged girl who worshipped her alcoholic father, fawned over her infant brother, and treated her 4 year old twin sisters like whipping girls. P.D. James seems to forget about the (abused) little girls later in the book as if they didn't matter.I used to like P.D. James. Now, I will never read another book of hers again."
2,2.5 stars,"A bad boy's rougish ways come to a crashing halt when he rejects the wrong woman, the granddaughter of a voodoo queen. Cursed now to be a man only at night and a frog by day for the next month, at the end of which he will be just a frog if he hasn't found true love, Craig Thibedeaux is aided in his quest by his uncle, Joe, and a dog who makes his amphian self a pet. True love turns out to be not exactly his usual type of girl. Rather than a vapid and easy young woman, his salvation takes the form of a brainiac scientist with zero self confidence in her appeal, even though she has a lot of it. Her passion in life is science and research, but under her own self imposed curse has never known love. Each one needs the other to set them free.** Using classic techniques and traditional jokes associated with the Bayou, Ms. James delivers a subtle message underneath this, showing that curses often are blessings in disguise. **"
3,"Interesting premise, mediocre execution","Frankowski ventures into territory charted by Drake, Laumer, Heinlein, and Saberhagen, and actually comes up with a number of original twists on the theme of space-age armored warfare. But while he does have some novel technical ideas, the story itself dies about a third of the way through and then limps along on Frankowski's folksy narrative style. While this is pleasant, the story would probably have been better as a novella or some such."
3,Not bad for a Frankowskiesque future setting,"I just finished this book, and I enjoyed it. I have read all of his novels and this is the first that takes place in the distant future on different worlds. Not a bad attempt."
2,"Vintage Frankowski, for good or bad","This is a fairly typical Frankowski novel, written in a typical Frankowski voice. If you have read any of his other novels, you'll recognize the narrator by his self-righteous yet wry attitude towards everything. I must confess that I found myself fairly bored by the book, having abandoned it at around 2/3s mark. Having said that, it's not really horrible...just not very good."
4,Old Leo is back!,"This book is fun to read just like all of the other Leo Frankowski books! it is especially intersting to read it now with the whole bombing going on in the Yugoslavian region! Also the idea of dream world is similar to some of the new hit movies, The Matrix? I love this book! Please let there be a sequael!William Huang"
1,Suprise ending means I'll never trust Frank again,I loved the paperback but I will never be able to trust the author after I discovered the 'surprise' ending in the hardcover.I do not support 'practical' jokes of any kind with hard currency.
5,They Don't Make Music Like This Anymore!!!,"Song for song one of the Greatest Cds/albums ever made. Every song is great!!! I saw these guys several times in the late 80s and early 90s. It's a shame that they never hit it big here. Maybe that's a good thing. I listen to this cd and wonder why the radio sucks so badly these days. Maybe someday, one these sucky bands that we hear so much on the radio will go back and listen to this album realize this is how you write pop music. Buy this Cd!! keep the legacy alive!! Long Live Miles Hunt!!!"
1,pooor service,The vendor did not send the right color and it was too much of a hassle to send it back for desired product. just won't order brand or vendor product in future.
3,Nice strap but.....,Nice strap but have to say I felt a little annoyed that the price went down five bucks the day after I purchased it. I felt it was a little high to begin with but since it was christmas and all and the color she likes I got it. SO nice strap but uncool jack the price up for xmas buyers only to drop it.
5,Perfect Partner,"I purchased the guitar strap along with the guitar for my granddaughter - perfect combination, she loves them, really need this strap so she can hold the guitar 'JUST RIGHT"". Easy fit, strong and the right size."
2,don't waste your money,"Could not get it to work right. Wouldn't keep track of heart rate & despite following the instructions, some functions would not work. Maybe it needs a new battery, would not purchase again."
5,Love their products!,"This is an awesome day-time eye kit! I normally don't wear eye makeup during the day, but if I do these are the colors I wear because its nice, light and natural. I love the brushes, especially the defining brush! I also love the eye-liner and liner brush because you can't see that you're wearing eye liner (doesn't leave a thick line) but definitely lines and defines your eyes. I can even wear it on my bottom lash line. Definitely worth the money for the 4 powders and 3 brushes!"
2,NOT SO GOOD,"I am a big fan of Bare Minerels, they are great for my skin, I use the foundation everyday, so i decided to try the eyes kit, and i am quite dissapointed: the colors are just plain and quite common and they don't stay long and fade easyly. I rather keep using my Make up forever and Bobbi Brown ones...."
1,Don't buy this CD,"I would not recommend this CD to anyone. The songs are boring and it seems very ""homemade""- not professionally done at all. I teach Spanish to preschoolers and this CD never even made it into the classroom. The kids love the Sesame Street Fiesta Songs and the Doble De Amigos CDs that I bought. This cannot compare to the catchy tunes and funny lyrics on those CDs."
2,I am disappointed +++,"Repetitive music, not to be listened in a moving car on the freeway like I did on cruise control, because you will miss any subtle essence + fall asleep. I should have not bought it. Loops endlessly repeating themselves ad vitam eternam! Is this a joke? BTW I am a very patient person, so..."
1,Is this Silverplate or Stainless Steel?,That's a pretty important piece of information and I can only wonder why it is not clearly stated. Without that information I couldn't give this ad a very high rating.
3,Joints feel a bit cheap,"The arm is made of solid brass, and matches very well with my shower head.The joints require hard tightening in order to have the arm set, and prevent leaks.Mine will stay fixed for the most parts, but for someone who requires frequent adjustments,I am afraid that the joints will get loose and leaky."
1,does not hold shower head in a extended outward position,it will not hold my shower head when extended out away from the wall. i have tried to tighten it as much as i can and still it falls.
4,"good novel, good edition","For those who know the novel already, this particular edition (World's Classics) is a nice one to have; it includes both Scott's own footnotes (which are indicated in-text) and the editor's (which are not indicated in the text). For those not familiar with the work, this is an excellent historical novel dealing with the Scottish rebellion of 1745. The events depicted are real, though most of the characters are not. It has the ""classic"" elements of a novel: love, war, suspense, etc. It's also an interesting depicition of the many layers of society on one small island. Good for history buffs, literature fans, or people just looking for a good novel!"
4,great reading,"this came as recommended reading to me, if you are walking and living in the prophetic get the Elijah Task"
5,Ojibwa history by one of their own,"An excellent book covering the history of the Ojibwas primarily in the Northern Wisconsin/Minnesota area. William Warren did a fine job of badgering the tribal elders till he received the information he sought. Written in the 1880's, Warren writes of the different clans and their interactions, the introduction to the white men they liked (French) and hated (British), and the constant warring with other tribes (mostly Sioux) over prime hunting lands which took the lives of many. According to Warren, ""Ojibwa"" means ""to roast until puckered"", needless to say, he's not talking about dinner. If just one book on the Ojibwas is in your plans, this should be the one. I myself would prefer to read a book written by someone who actually talked to these tribal elders over 100 years ago, not someone who attempts to do so nowadays, generations (and clouded memories) later."
5,A Wonderful Bit of History,As a distance relative I was very happy to see that a William Warren's work is still published today! Thank you Theresa M. Schenk for the time you devoted to research and history! I loved the biography that Theresa Schenk wrote as well!
3,Good Information & History,"Lots of good information, but pretty dry reading. Very true language for the time period in which it was written."
5,Exceptional,"To the list of fantastic finger style guitarists like Antoine Dufour, Andy McKee, Michael Hedges, and Don Ross I will now be adding Erik Mongrain. As many did I discovered his playing on Youtube, where in addition to the usual ""playing"" he also provides an excellent example of the form called ""lap tapping"" in which one lays the guitar on its back and proceeds to tap the soundboard with the fingers...Let it be known, potential customer Mongrain is a master at this. I was awestruck. This Cd goes in with the greats. Buy it."
5,Brilliant,"Mongrain has mind-boggling technique, but he is also a superb composer; nearly all of this songs are incredibly subtle and sophisticated. In the world of guitar, this album should be a major event, akin to the appearance of Leo Kottke's ""Six and Twelve String Guitar"" back in the late sixties."
3,"Even if you don't like Bill Murray, it is a good family film","My son wanted the movie because it had an elephant in it. Though I hesitated, due to Bill Murray being the main actor, I took the chance and am very glad I did. It has turned into a favorite at our household. Their are many elements in the movie that stimulate discussion of family values and beliefs as well as a good old fashioned feel good ending. I actually found Bill endearing, which was hard to imagine since he usually struggles with his likeability on-screen. It's a good solid buy."
5,Great Seller and a quick shipper.,I recieved the item as stated and in the condition they said it was. I was really glad that the item arrived within a few days od my order. That makes them a top ten in my book. Thanks Seller.
3,The elephant is very cute.,"Leonard Maltin was right about Matthew McCoughnehy being over the top, but much of the remainder of this film is very appealing and fun. Circus fans will appreciate much of the inside humor, such as the tatooed lady saying her ""circus cooties"" won't rub off on Murray. What would you do if you were in this same predicament? Not hilariously funny, but recommended."
3,"Ok, but not great","I was mostly disappointed with this film, although I can't say it wasn't at least a bit entertaining. Unlike most of Murray's films, this one does offer some family entertainment (most of his films are above the heads of kids, or rated R) and all in all it is after all Bill Murray and he is among the very best comedians to hit the big screen. His brand of sarcastic and playing it straight comedy is always entertaining to watch, even if the film itself isn't the greatest. A mild recommendation."
5,One of my Favorites!,Have loved this movie for years! I gifted it to my niece for Christmas because she loves elephants and it's a great family movie. Although the cost of this DVD is a bit extreme especially for an old movie.
5,We really liked it again!,"My husband is an 18 wheeler driver and we had a good laugh at Bill Murray driving the tractor truck without training, my husband said it was a hoot seeing how funny Bill is at driving one."
3,Run of the Mill Murray Vehicle,"When minor-league motivational speaker Jack Corcoran's (Bill Murray) circus clown father passes away and leaves him a ""huge"" inheritance, Jack soon finds out it's a really big Asian elephant named Vera (played by Tai). Adding insult to injury, he has also been left stuck with paying a $35,000 bill for damages caused by the errant elephant. Wanting nothing more than to send the pachyderm packing, Jacks tries to decide whether to sell her to a zookeeper or an animal trainer. While he's making his decision, Vera worms her way into his heart and changes his life for the better. Awww...Murray is upstaged here by his large gray costar.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,"Good, but use with caution and good maps","Since I haven't travelled all of the routes in this book, I can only rate it by the parts near me. I live (and cycle) near Ottawa. Mr. Katz's recommended route is just fine, but mis-described. He refers to Hope Side Road as regional road 49, which is Eagleson, March, and Almonte Roads, but not Hope Side Road. This description occurs twice in two different routes.The other obvious point is that this edition was published in 1994; amalgamation of municipalities and downloading of provincial roads with lots of changes of numbers makes a current local map even more necessary. And an older map might be handy for understanding some of the routes."
2,Poor binding of Cover,"When I opened this book for the first time the cover came apart. It was not glued properly, this a defect from the binding process.How do you want to preoceed to replqce the book?Thanks,Serge Drapequ"
1,Do not buy,"Worst CD I've ever purchased. I heard one song on the radio. Made the same mistake everyone else does. Thinking the whole CD was like that, bought the stupid thing. It's just a bunch of noise, with one musical track. Please Please listen to the samples before you buy. I blame myself for not listening. The little bits you hear are exactly what the whole track will sound like. There's no variation. Oh, and get this, one of the tracks has random super high-pitched tones in it. I bet Mr Guy Called Gerald thought he'd done something cool no-one else had done before. Well...no-one else did it cause it's IRRITATING."
4,Explains it all,It is super thorough but reads like a textbook. It is a great reference book so I am glad I purchased but definatly not easy reading.
4,Sound advice on what to eat -- and what to avoid,"Of the several sports nutrition books I've read, this is still the best. Good information grounded in science, not fads. The writing style makes complex issues easily understandable. Would have been nice to have more sample menus and even some recipes so I took off one star."
3,For those wanting LOTS of information,"This book is VERY detailed. Great if that's what you're looking for, but I was looking for something less complicated. Honestly I didn't read the whole book, but skimmed the chapters I thought would be helpful. To me it reads more like a text book. I wanted more of a meal-plan type book to use while training for marathons. If you are a serious runner it may be helpful, but I'll be returning it to the store!"
1,"A bunch of old, tired, and general advice","Truly disappointed in this book. Nothing in here about any of the more recent (say last 3 years) nutritional developments -- e.g., ""paleo"" diet for endurance athletes, etc. All this book contains is the same old, and rather boring, nutritional retoric that you can find in just about any issue of Triathlete magazine you pick up. Additionally, the author really only glosses over issues like the glycemic index and its impace on nutritional strategy for pre-race fueling, race fueling and post-race recovery. She recommends foods which are high in processed sugars and highly-processed grains for normal eating, but doesn't even attempt to explain or express contrary views about the value of these foods to an athlete.Bottom line: If you have been following sports nutrition at all, you will find nothing new or interesting here."
4,LES PAUL & MARY FORD CD,"This CD is enjoyable, but a little disappointing with the number of songs on it.Great for nostalgic listening. Would recommend it for that reason alone. Terrific songwriters of the day"
3,Slighty disappointed...,"This was more of a historical account of Massachusetts's ghosts. A number of the stories are well known (to ghost fanatics, that is,) and offer no new information. If you are expecting a collection of stories, compiled from first-hand accounts of witnesses, you will be disappointed."
5,Truly a great book,"After watching the 'Blue Planet' documentaries on TV I developed an interest about life under the sea. Some of the documentary footage was truly groundbreaking work in terms of capturing the animals on film and bringing it to our homes in such a unique way.The book, like the documentary is truly a great piece of work. It's well planned, presented and written. It covers all aspects of ocean life with out becoming to specific with regard to certain species. Some of the photographs throughout the book are truly wonderful; this book is a must for everyone, of all ages. It will satisfy any appetite for deep-sea discovery, shore life and marine biology.5 Stars, This book has everything you need and more, and the presentation is second to none."
2,Not as it was billed...,"Blue PlanetI was disappointed to see that the book, promised to be unread, had indeed been read. I was astonished to see that the seller had placed stickers bearing his logo on the dust jacket -- three times!"
5,A must see,"This is a must see item... Each menu is divided into HIS/HERS tasks to get the job done!It even has little tips such as this on a HIS page :REMEMBER: it will take your partner about 50 minutes to prpare the chops, so plan your activities accordingly. (A small glass of wine or well prepared martini might be a nice contribution to the congenial kitchen atmosphere). (((If only we could have a book like this for all activities!)))A great gift for a couple."
4,All Good,This is a very comprehensive and detailed book for beginners andfor engineers who want to use it as a quick reference guide.all good
5,Adventure,"Fighting, drinking, wenching...what is not to like. This is a grand adventure story that sets a boy's blood racing whether he is 10 or at the other end of the spectrum. A great read."
1,Get the recent translation instead,"This is a free version, and you get what you pay for: a subpar translation. I am reading this book to my 10-year old son, and the awkward convoluted language full of antiquated words made it hard for him to follow the story and for me to enjoy the reading. For $1.90 you can get a translation done in 2006 on your Kindle:http://www.amazon.com/Three-Musketeers-Alexandre-Dumas-p%C3%A8re/dp/0670037796 . The new translation is much better, we are now both enjoying the book again!"
1,Vocabulary too advanced to hold childrens' attention,"I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school. They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words. This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children. A bust for us."
4,A true period tale,"It's interesting listening to an old book about an even older time. The technical aspects of the CD are excellent. The reading is good, clear. I'm having some problems dealing with a classic, but I suspect that is my problem, and not anyone else's. What was rollicking in Dumas' time has changed in the hundred+ years since it was written."
5,The Three Musketeers,"The Three Musketeers is a true classic, written for adults but children reading at the 8th grade or above level would do well to read it also.The four friends Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and d'Artagnan ride in service to Louis XIII but serve more the queen Anne of Austria against His Eminence, the Cardinal Richelieu. D'Artagnan is supposed to be the star character of the novel but, to be honest, I have the impression that Athos, the Count de la Fere, is actually the main character as it is his pre-musketeer history that most determines the outcome. And, before the ""liberation"" of women, we have a strong woman character in the antagonist the Lady de Winter, whom even the Cardinal Richelieu fears.One must say that these four fire the imagination and ignite a hunger for history -- even to the point of causing some prejudice against certain historical figures whose place in the true history of France is not as maleviolent as Alexandre Dumas, pere, makes one believe."
3,The story overcomes the faults of this translations,"This is my third time reading 'The Three Musketeers', the three readings being spread out over about 60 years. So I've read it as a teenager, in my middle age and now as an old man. It has not lost its appeal. Novels in the 19th century moved along a good deal more slowly than they do nowadays. If you set out to read books of that period you have to accept this. Dumas sets the scene and introduces his characters in a long preamble to the main plot. Once that commences, however, things move at a spanking pace. This translation is not very good, being too literal so that some of the French phrases and idioms have been turned into very clumsy English. In a way this is rather quaint and lends period atmosphere. There are also quite a few typos but these are so obvious that there is no difficulty in knowing what was really intended. In the final analysis, Dumas's thrilling tale sweeps the reader along, overcoming all faults!"
4,Not like the movies,Like this better than any 3 musketeers movie. I really like the story. Not as good as Count of Monte Cristo though.
2,These Guys Are Passing For Heroes?,"I'm normally all for a good yarn full of swashbucklers and adventure, but this one just didn't sit well with me. I found the protagonists to be less than sympathetic and far from admirable. D'Artagnan and company were nothing but a pack of self-centered brutes with egos the size of Jupiter. They bullied and slaughtered anyone who got in their way [or even annoyed them a little], they were extremely snobbish, and they spent the whole novel sponging off of anyone they could. I realize that the culture was different back then, but I just couldn't make myself care what happened to these guys. But, if you'd like to read an exciting adventure story with a worthy hero, I strongly recommmend ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" by Baroness Orczy."
1,Why!,"I ordered this one translated by Richard Pevear(and publshed by Viking Adult), but came the book published by Quality Paperback Book Club. I can't believe it!"
2,Water damage? Really,"The book was in okay condition overall. The binding was secure, etc. However, I was surprised that Amazon would sell a used book with water damage. I can expect wear, a few bent earmarks on pages, may a stray pencil marks here and there; water damage is a little different. Many booksellers consider books with any water damage whatsoever to have no retail value and will not deal with them..."
1,Boring...,"I love a lot of the classics, but I just could not get into this one at all. It is just so long winded. It is a shame as the basic storyline is fantastic."
4,A Fabulous Romantic Story,"This was one of my favorite books, growing up. Dumas created a fast-paced, intriguing story of passion, friendship, treason, and politics. Who could forget the irresistible force of the four friends: the clever hothead D'Artagnan, so young and full of initiative; the cunning and calculating Aramis; the naive and good-natured Portos, with his superhuman strength; and the wise, disillusioned Atos, still full of inner strength amid his drinking. The main love story of the book is not that compelling. It somehow pales amid all the action. There are also a few chronological inconsistencies in the book that resulted from Dumas' neck-breaking pace of writing books. But these can be easily overlooked along with a somewhat unrealistic course of events. This still is a fabulous, entertaining story. The book's strongest appeal is to the readers in their teens."
5,The best book I have ever read!,"Le Trois Mousquetaire is my favourite book. D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis team up to save Anne of Austria. Anyone who love sword fights or adventure should read this book. Alexander Dumas is the best writer ever!PS. If anyone has read this book and greatly appeciates Alexander Dumas's writing, please email me. Thank you."
3,Men acting stupidly,"There were many enjoyable parts of this book. However, there was too much unwarranted emotion--young D'Artagnan was always getting his undies in a knot about something. I liked the historical perspective, but i was appalled at how the musketeers treated their servants (lackeys). They felt free to call them names and insult them even tho the lackeys often saved their bacon.This book with all it swashbuckling and sword play and inanity, would probably appeal to young men more than other audiences."
5,A wonderful diversion.,"I enjoyed everything about this audiobook.My only exposure to the Three Musketeers to this point was through terrible movies that share not a shred of similarity to this work.I was completely and pleasantly surprised by the rich language, the attention to detail and the readers ability convey it so eloquently.As a fan of writers like Jane Austen and Patrick O’Brian I once again find myself enjoying the language and character of the book more than the story itself.I was actually sad to see the book end after developing an attachment to the main characters.this is one of those rare books that stays in the mind long after the last page has been read."
2,All Foreign Phrases SCREAMING,"This Kindle edition puts all foreign phrases in all caps, rather than italicized. This is a grievous error in a book with a good deal of Latin and French. Luckily, Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo does not suffer the same typographic insult."
2,"Had it from Gutenberg already, I wanted the audiobook.",The two star rating is not for the book which I alread had from Project Gutenberg.I wanted the audiobook which was too big to fit on my kindle.I do not have an Idevice so I loaded Itunes and downloaded it and converted it to audio cds.It took 20 cds to complete the audiobook.It seems that it was made as painful as possible to get the audiobook.Love the story though.
4,Second-tier romanticism,"Not as good as The Count of Monte Cristo, but Milady de Winter is one of literature's all-time greatest villainesses. Worth reading, but I would recommend Victor Hugo's novels over Dumas's as the pinnacle of French romanticism."
5,Great book,"Great book. A wonderful classic. A true pleasure to read again. Make sure to point it out to your friends. Heck, the book is free even, whats to complain about?"
5,Camaraderie & Homeric Characters.,"Thee best historical novel to start with if you haven't read many. One of the most entertaining and memorable reading experiences for me. Dumas writes of such camaraderie and real men which escapes the average reader. Forget the many bad movie-versions. They have never done justice to his original Three Musketeers novel. This version(translated by Richard Pevear,Penguin Classics Deluxe edition)also is the perfect size:not too small or cumbersome, with helpful notes also."
5,The Story of Life,The four main characters lived an exciting life. They fought against the most powerful man in Europe and lived to brag about it. As a team they complimented each other's strengths and vices; they couldn't have had it better. They had to separate in the end like all who live in this world.
1,The three marketeers,Horrible.To long.No action.No blobs.No zombies.Horrible.Bad science a rugged B-) f2f :/ g in g :/ chic b chic/ vnjkhmhmjkhkhkhknbhn
3,I needed to go back and read some classics I didn't read as a kid,"Needless to say this is a classic. It has weathered the test of time. I am not sure the this particular translation really captured the content or intent Dumas was trying to pen. Although I achieved the objective which was to fill a gap in my reading. My recommendation would be read the original French if you can or if not find a better translation.In this particular book's favor, the price is right, that is, $0.00."
5,Reviving,"Never stopped to amaze me and revive my spirit whenever I read it. If you want to refresh your reading list, then this is the book to freshen you up."
4,"It's grand, is what it is!","After seeing numerous film adaptations of Dumas' immortal work, I had to read the book itself. I was not disappointed. While it is certainly lengthy dense (and, thus, not for everyone), The Three Musketeers cannot but enchant.The story is well-known: In 17th-century France, D'Artagnan, a young Gascon of a minor family, comes to Paris to seek his fortune as a member of the king's Musketeers. In attempting to do so, he meets or runs afoul of Rochefort and Milady DeWinter - creatures of the scheming Cardinal Richilieu - and the unforgettable Musketeers: the brooding Athos, religious Aramis, and jaunty Porthos. They form an easy brotherhood and fall into foiling the Cardinal's plots while they themselves try to impress their various mistresses and scrape by financially. The book is more than just a great adventure - Dumas also adroitly discusses the class structure of the day, parodies the religious wars of the 1600s, and skewers academic scholarship. A wonderful, rich read."
5,one for all and all for me.,"The three muskateers, the classic Dumas novel with the art of Tom Kidd. How can you possibly go wrong?"
5,An all time classic.,I have always wanted to read the original since I have seen so many made for TV take off's of the Musketeers. This was a great read.
2,"Under-rated classic, sadly under-read","Having really enjoyed all of The Count of Monte Christo, also read by John Lee, I am sad to find this Dumas 'Pere' less satisfying. Both the writing and the reading have a stuttering effect on my brain: short sentences similarly delivered,sudden shifts in focus and little differentiation between the characters voices. I felt tense, listening, worrying I'll miss the bit that matters. It's a book worth knowing, but not one I'll subject myself to twice."
3,rousing action-adventure that drags at the end,"A rousing action-adventure-comedy-romance about the famous Athos, Porthos, and Aramis and their new friend D'Artangnan, the young hot-head, all whom get embroiled in courtly intrigues with the Cardinal, the Queen, the King, the Duke of Buckingham, and the villainous and evil Milady. Starts of humorous, mysterious, and exciting with strong characters, but the second half of the novel drags horribly. Grade: C"
3,Review From One Book At A Time,"I've only seen the Disney version (the one with Kiefer Sutherland) of this book, so thought I might enjoy it for my classics challenge. Boy, was I surprised. It was not an easy read. It's large and cumbersome. I didn't have to force my way though it, just had to take my time. I was most shocked by the differences. I was under the impression that D'Artagnan was a follower and more of the type to get into trouble. He's actually more of the leader in this book. The musketeers aren't as valiant and courageous as I thought. More along the lines of men who like their women and their wine, and prefer to haggle their way to getting them for free. There wasn't as much suspense, intrigue, coercion, and backstabbing as I anticipated. I was glad when I finished it, but happy I read it"
4,They Don't Name A Candy Bar After Any Old Book,"In a world plagued by ludicris pulp fiction and so called ""clasics"" which serve no other purpose than curing insomnia, The Three Musketeers serves as a redeeming element to literature. I found its wonderous blend of adventure, friendship, and political turmoil to be well worth my time. I encourage everyone who has every fantasized about crossing swords with an enemy to buy this book."
5,Text-book example of how rock should sound!!!!!,"Yes sir,good old fashioned blues-based in your face rock-n-roll!! Unlike Whitesnakes later ""commercial"" efforts,this one is very,very tight.Excellent musicianship and vocals.The songs are simple and catchy,but played with great enthusiasm and effort.It is very clear that the band members were gelling,and loved putting this fine album together.""Don't Break My Heart Again"" is a thumping,hard driver that will make you stomp your feet!! And ""Lonely Days Lonely Nights"" is an awesome blues guitar effort with some damn fine lead work. ""Come 'An Get It"",""Girl"",""Would I Lie To You"",and ""Hit And Run"" should be textbook examples as to how simple, straight-forward, rock and roll should be played!!! Whitesnake (other than Lovehunter) doesn't get any better than this.Highly recommended!!!!!"
1,Leaks And No Customer Support,"We are now using our second 4 cup Mr Coffee. The first one lasted a little over a year and started leaking from the bottom; had rust, etc. Bought this one about two months ago and it began leaking after only about two weeks. It doesn't leak from the bottom; it has what appears to be a design flaw in that it leaks around the top of the basket 'housing' and onto the burner/warmer and then onto our countertop. I sent an email to Mr Coffee 'nonsupport' concerning the first unit. No reply. Then I sent another about the present unit about two weeks ago. No reply. This is our last Mr Coffee product."
3,MISTY HILLS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT,"AS THE OTHER PERSON WROTE, MISTY HILLS IS A WELL-WRITTEN, GOODBOOK BUT DISAPPONTING FOR LEARNING ABOUT NATIVE AMERICAN HABITS ANDLIFE. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN ANYONE'S FAMILY. I THOUGHT THE BOOK WOULD BE AKIN TO MEDAWAR'S OTHER TWO NATIVE-AMERICAN BOOKS. I ALSO DIDN'T LIKE BEING EVERY YOUNG PERSON'S SEX LIFE. END"
3,This book is ok for someone who has no idea about the history of Chile.,"This book is ok for someone who has no idea about the history of Chile.The book was entertaining, but not believable, although the author says she did tons of research... that's questionable.Rather than reading fake stuff about those years, I recommend to read another book, which is based on true facts and tells you a lot more of what people from Chile has gone through, and that's ""Adios al septimo de linea"", although is not intended to narrate the same historical period.Enjoy!!"
4,Buenísima novela histórica,"Isabel Allende es una de mis favoritas escritoras, creo que he leído casi todo lo que ha publicado, excepto las novelas juveniles. Por otro lado me gustan las novelas históricas y está es de las buenas. Hay otro lector que crítica que así no se hablaba en los años 1500, pero !se imaginan que aburrida habría sido una novela si hubiese intentado copiar como los personajes hablaban en aquella época!. Creo que es una novela histórica buenísima, y se aprende mucho, además de ser entretenida."
2,Decepcionante,"He estado debatiéndome si debía dar 2 ó 3 estrellas al libro. Finalmente decidí que debía darle 2 porque se trata de una autora que, por su trayectoria, debió ofrecernos algo mejor. Sigo sin encontrar a la Isabel Allende de ""La casa de los espíritus"" y ""Paula"". Después de ellos, no ha conseguido nada que logre convencerme. En esta novela, sus personajes no son consistentes. La protagonista se expresa con un lenguaje demasiado moderno. No hay una perspectiva realmente histórica. Como escritora, debió saber cómo resolver esto. Para quienes buscan una historia apasionante, con personajes llenos de fuerza y misterio, recomiendo ""La isla de los amores infinitos"", de Daína Chaviano. De las 7 personas que conozco que han leído la novela, no hay una que no se haya quedado fascinada con el libro. Para mí, y para otros amigos, ha sido el gran descubrimiento del año."
2,Ines del Alma Mia,"Extremely disappointing. No character or story development just consistent descriptions of fighting and suffering. If I had read it without knowing who the author is, I would not have believed it to be a work by Isabelle Allende."
4,A good book of historical fiction,"Very enjoyable story that takes place over several generations, giving the reader a fictional view based on the history of Chile.Allende tells a great story in this book, as in others she has written that take place in California. Recommended"
4,"buen libro, pero pérdida de enfoque","Me gustó mucho este libro, pero le quité una estrella porque hacia el final pasa mucho tiempo hablando de Lautauro, cuando se supone que el enfoque debe estar en Inés."
3,Me quedo un ligero sabor de traicion...,"Excelentemente escrito, la historia tiene un componenete real bien investigado y un componente emocional que balancea las realidades y la vision que el lector tiene durante el libro y especialmente cuando se siente a meditar despues de cerrar la contratapa. Bien escrito, pero las emociones estuvieron demasiado atadas a los conquistadores que derramaron la sangre que corria libre en los estrechos llanos chilenos. Una lastima, la araucania que empezo a perder con Valdivia y que ha continuado perdiendo, pudo haber sido mucho mejor tratada. Me senti leyendo un libre escrito para entender al conquistador, para entender cuan duro fue matar; me senti traicionada."
3,realmente no se,"He terminado la mitad de este libro, Ines de alma mia. No se si lo voy a seguir leyendo. La voz de Ines entra y sale y no tiene un estilo fijo, y su manera de hablar es como una mujer de nuestra epoca. Es dificil creer que se trata de una senora pobre de los anos 1500. Los asuntos que guian sus acciones no me convencen.Los acontecimientos que relata son horrorosos, y no es claro como sabria Ines los detalles y la gente que protagoniza en esta historias.Quisiera que me gustara el libro, porque tengo una tradicion de admirar a los cuentos de Isabel Allende. Pero este me esta perdiendo. Prefiero que Isabel escriba algo que tome lugar en nuestra epoca de hoy para oir de vuelta su propria voz."
4,Good story,True to her style Ms Allende tells a fascinating story about a very important eventtaking place in an important SA country. It portraits the adventures of a courageous womanas she helps in the occupation of a new territory. Her analisis of femenine psychology and capacitymakes the heroine of this tale vivid and difficult to forget.
5,"Brilliant !!!!, simply Brilliant !!!!","Allende, como siempre una escritora estupenda, un libro que realmente vale la pena leer.A fantastic book. Allende is just simply a brilliant Author. This book is a must."
4,Classic Isabel Allende,"As with ""La Hija de la Fortuna"" and ""Retrato en Sepia"", Isabel Allende uses her masterful storytelling abilities to blend in history and fiction, resulting on a very captivating novel. Allende's writing style is especially easy to read in the Spanish original for non-native Spanish speakers."
3,Discover Chile's historiy with Ines del Alma mia,An interesting novel on the conquest of Chile. How learning about history with pleasure and suspense with the usual epic style of Isabel Allende.A good idea for a present for Mothers' day!
4,Another great recording by the main man of metal,"Some songs do not stand out, but tracks like Sacred Heart and Another Day are great. Hell, they're all good, buy them all!"
5,"It's not THAT bad, people","This is the first (and only, so far)Dio album I bought. I am a new fan...I enjoyed ronnie in BS so I checked this band out.I own this album on vinyl, and it is one of the best vinyl purchases ive made so far. I love every song on it. The guitaring is excellent and the ""cheese-factor"" (some 80s keyboarding)is actually kind of cool to hear from Dio. I especially enjoy ""King of Rock N Roll"" and ""Sacred Heart"". ""King"" is an excellent album opener.I've heard most of ""Holy Diver"" on LaunchCast radio, and I gotta say, I like 'Sacred Heart"" much better. To all Dio fans and non-fans: give this album a chance! Once it grows on you, you can't get enough and look forward to every song on the record.Also, I must say, I am proud to be the first chick to review this album :-) ."
5,Highly Under-rated,"This is my favorite Dio album. Keyboards were used in previous albums, but here they are more consistant over the whole album. What sounds more mystical- keyboards or guitars? There is no weak filler here and thus is the least cheesey of Dio's albums. I liked the song off here better than others that were featured on the Sacred Heart video. The stage set for this tour was awesome, complete with orb, dragon and sword. Like all ""sell-out"" and ""mediocre"" albums by big metal bands, it's more appealling to the diehard fans who've heard the hits 1,000 times. Sacred Heart is the most overtly mystical Dio album, which is what Dio is all about. An under-rated gem in the Dio back catolgue."
1,"As if ""Holy Diver"" wasn't bad enough.","This disc showcases Ronnie James' ego. ""King of Rock and Roll?"" Is this song about Elvis? This is one of the worst recordings of all time. You know, I was 19 when this came out, and, I must admit, I was a Dio fan (I used a lot of drugs back then) but when this came out, my buddy bought it and we both hated it. We tried to get into it, but we just found it to be boring and tiresome. We didn't even go to the Dio concert that year, we were just so let down."
3,The Last in Line?,"This was the last album featuring the original lineup and started the decline of Dio's solo material. I have to say the commercialism of this album doesn't bother me as much as most people. There are a lot of pretty good songs but not really any classics on here. Vivian Campbell is being pushed in the background on this one as Dio's electing to use more keyboards, I guess to get that ""Rainbow in the Dark"" hit, making the album not as heavy as the first two. My main issue with this album is the horrible high treble mix that was prevalent at the time. Maiden's ""Piece of Mind"" also suffered from this. I would love to have this record remixed at some point to correct this."
4,A finest album from Dio.,Sacred heart as when compared ro albums such Holy diver and Last in line is very good with some of the finest songs and which are just superb.This album is highly recommended
5,Very nice!,"Excellent product. Dio is the guy!!!XDProduct arrived in time, as promissed. and in a verui nice quality! Thanks!!!XD"
3,A bit off the beaten path.,"Being off the beaten path is not always a bad thing, but this wasn't what I expected of a Dio album. It has the typical good writing, but the music just isn't there. No songs on this album blow me away although there are many that sound good. When I heard this album, I just couldn't believe the difference between albums with Vivian Campbell and the first one without him. I checked the label to make sure it said Dio on the front. Don't get me wrong. This album is pretty easy to listen to, but it's just not a great album. It's just OK."
3,Dio hits mid-life,"Sacred Heart is not one of my favorite Dio albums. He kinda tarnished his killer track record on this one. I'm not sure why the recording sounds so prehistoric here, but the lack of treble on this album is down right irritating! Songs like ""Shoot Shoot"" and ""Another Lie"" are right up there with the best of them though."
2,Stinky Heart,"This was a very dissapointing release from the little elf himself to me. Theres just no way he could follow up The Last in Line with this one. The songs sound like throwaways from the last album, i.e, filler. Vivian Campbell is in rare uninspired form (at least for his pre Def Leppard days) and the rest of the band just sounds tired. There are a few good songs, but they're few and far between. If you're a Dio fan who doesn't need everything and has the first two, skip this one and get Dream Evil instead."
2,What's wrong with you people? This is dull,"I really enjoyed Ronnie's first two albums, particularly ""Holy Diver"". However, this time out he starts to sound stale. If you have listened to his work with Rainbow and Sabbath along with the first two solo albums, you will have heard every idea here. Really, this is the album that lost it for me. I have not bought a Dio album since. Dull, dull, dull."
3,Great Album Cover,"I guess this is typical Dio, but apparently does not really break new ground for him. If I'm accusing him of pulling an AC/DC, at least with them, they still have memorable songs even if they sound the same from album to album. I can't blame Mr. Dio for not wanting to fix something that isn't broke, but I wish he could have come up with some better songs.When I first got this album, it was a gift from a friend when I was stationed in Turkey in the 80's. Though the album cover was great, the music just didn't seem to live up to the graphics.As I just recently burned this to CD to play on my long commute to work, I find that a few careful listens reveal the songs to be much better than I first remembered. They are all good, but even after several listens, not all that memorable.There is no one cut that really stands out for me, though overall, I could listen to it over and over again without too much grief. It's just missing a certain spark.Still, recommended for Dio fans."
2,Ok hammer in general,"I have wanted the Stiletto titanium hammer for about 2 years and finally I received as a gift. I read all of the reviews on the hammer and one concerned me. John Crawford reviewed it on October 30, 2000. He wrote that it is a cool hammer to nail nails but not to pull nails. He broke the handle after the third or forth nail. He's right, I didn't even have mine on the job for two days. I pulled a couple nails with it and then nailed a 16d nail and the head broke off. The handle is way to thin which goes into the head. Don't get me wrong I fell in love with the hammer the first day but to be a every day framing hammer not a hammer to have. I had to break out old faithfull, my Estwing. I still have my old $15.00 framing hammer when I first started in construction over 10 years ago. If they can figure out to make the handle stronger then the Stiletto is a must have."
2,OK nailer But horrible on the job site.,"I got the hammer some time ago and thought it was awsome at first, until I tried to use it at work. I am rough framer, and use my hammer about a hundred times a day. This hammer is cool nailing nails But what they don't tell you is that you're not allowed to pull nails with it. I didn't know that until I pulled the third or fourth nail and the head of the hammer fell off. If you like the feel of a lightweight titanium hammer, and you are going to use it, I suggest that you go with the Death stick. It weighs the same and the handle doesn't break."
4,Stiletto Titanium Hammer,"Back ordered, but arrived as specified. Great notice of changes in status of order and delivery date. Very satisified"
2,Decent tool,"As a framer/carpenter, I have found that the quality of Stiletto tools has gone down, perhaps from being made over seas. Had a very negative experience dealing with customer service on the repair of a fiberglass stiletto also. Was sent a replacement which was missing the magnet and then failed after a few months of work. So disappointing, when the company used to have a desirable product on the site."
3,David W,I thought I was buying an iconic 'made in USA hammer'. This product is not cheap. I was disappointed to discover it is actually manufactured in China. This is not mentioned on the product description. I haven't used it yet so it may be the greatest hammer ever made. I purchased it also basing my decision on provenance. I should have bought the Douglas. I would have sent it back however it would have cost me way to much. I live in Australia.
5,Much More than a Historical Memoir,"I grew up romanticizing the people who settled California and of the Native Americans who were forced to give up control of their own lives with the westward migration. This wonderful book turns most of my old beliefs to dust. This is a very personal and unvarnished memoir of a young boy who found himself drawn to the Miwok people living around him. He learned much from them. He learned about what survived of their culture and language, about their subdued dignity and sorrows. He shows us, in a very visual style, how they coped each day in that harsh and hostile environment of ""white"" Murphys. These violent, sad and poignant tales give the reader a brand new perspective on this time and place and, indeed, on the people both native and white who inhabited the Sierra foothills in the 20's, 30's and 40's."
1,leaks constantly,"I bought it from this seller right here at Amazon - this is a review for the exact product I have at home.Looks good, but leaks the whole time while there is batter inside. I ended up putting a dish on the bottom of it while I was making my pancakes and at the end I could scoop the batter from the dish and make a ""whole nother"" pancake.It's too cheap to return (I paid more for the expedite shipping to receive it before the holidays). Not worth returning it. :(I will probably buy the one from Crate and Barrel, seems to be a good quality product and it cost around $32, AND better yet - I can return if needed."
3,Not so good as I expected,"For me the best Beatles years are the studio years. In these videos they spend way too much time on the concert years. Not that these years aren't good, but we all know that The Beatles are like wine: They improved with time.All the real fans like me know that you can take Sgt. Pepper and The White Album and do a whole new Anthology around these two albums..... That would have been a lot better."
3,"Very long... in fact, too long","This five-disc set, as you might expect, has a lot of material on it. Which is good. But. The problem is that a lot of the material -- arguably the majority? -- really has no reason to be here. A lot of it is boring, and a lot of it is repetitive. You will hear and see the same songs performed multiple times on each disc, which frankly gets a bit tedious.Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of good material to be found on these discs, but it's just too far apart. I think they could have made a really solid two- or three-disc set out of this material by paring it down a bit."
4,beatles anthology,"great introduction to the series and the beatles themselves .shows how the band forms, with original members stuart sutcliffe and pete best, why pete was booted out and how ringo joined.rare footage of early gigs in hamburg and london.and new interviews with the beatles themselves. reccomended to any and all beatle fans!"
5,just fantastic,"I loved watching this collection about the most outstanding band in todays history. Not only are they all so very talented, but they were all very funny. It made me laugh. You can also see that not only were they a famous band, but they had lives of their own and families, wives, and children. It was interesting to see all the things they had to go through. It was hard for them all. I am so glad this has been made available for us fans, to get to know each one of them in a personal way. I especially enjoyed knowing about george harrison as he was always my favorite. He was such a kind sweet and gentle man. May we always remember george and john, paul and ringo, through this collection and through all of their wonderful songs. i think this collection should be made less expensive so that everyone can get a chance to own it and get to know about the great Beatles! its that good!!"
5,Beatles Anthology DVD Set,"I received this DVD set for Christmas and have been enthralled with it from the beginning. The interviews, recording outtakes, and rare film clips are worth it alone. But you do get an overall impression of how much or little the experience meant to at least the 3 (at that time) remaining Beatles. I think Paul has come to embrace and relish the music they did; I sometimes got the impression George could have done without much of the experience; and I was touched by Ringo's recollections. There were few memories Ringo talked about in a negative way. He said he loved going to the various places, and loved this and that. He seemed to really appreciate the closeness and friendship the 4 of them had, getting emotional at one point when he said it was 4 guys who just really loved each other.I also found the interviews with George Martin especially valuable. His unique perspective on their music and growth was very interesting to me.If you're a Beatles fan, you will enjoy this."
5,Beatles Anthology Review,"This series was done under the supervision of the surviving Beatles at the time (mid 90's) and is basically the story of The Beatles from their perspective. There are lots of interviews with Paul, George, and Ringo with footage from interviews with John. There is a lot of insight into why things happened the way they did. (i.e. their decision to stop touring, Brian Epstein's death, etc.) It starts from their Liverpool roots and follows their fame to Abbey Road. There is lots of excellent footage and I was particularly pleased that they included the ""videos"" that the band created some twenty years ahead of MTV. Because of the involvment of the surviving Beatles in the production, some of the conflict that happened within the band isn't mentioned or is mentioned briefly. The strongest things about this series are the interviews and the music. I highly recommend it, especially if you're a Beatles fan."
5,LOVE IT,"waited almost 3 weeks to get this shipped to me...the wait killed me, but it was totally worth it. could get a little repetitive for a normal person...but for a true Beatlemanic, it's a must-have. LOVE IT!"
5,a great dvd set,i just want to make this short but its the best i ever bought!!!!!!!!!! buy it its sooooo worth it !!!!
5,Top of the line,"I enjoyed this tremendously-George, Paul and Ringo (and John, too, actually) tell THEIR story- Loved the TV special several years ago and love watching this over again. I have it on Video and DVD. You will not be sorry !!!!!!!!"
3,"Quite entertaining, but could have been significantly better","I liked this series, especially the various live footage, but I also have a few complaints.""The Beatles Anthology"" is a VERY nice, almost fawning, portrayal of the Beatles, and their bitter and sometimes even hate-filled breakup is made to look like a friendly mutual decision where everybody loooooooves each other and just want to move on with their lives, yadayadayada.The fact that comments from the three surviving Beatles (anno 1996-97) and their various associates are never commented upon or analyzed in any way makes ""The Beatles Anthology"" a bit of a bland experience at times...some sort of unbiased commentary (other than various newscasters in old 60s TV clips) would have been nice.As it is, ""Anthology"" just rolls along, a bit monotously, offering a pleasant, often entertaining look at the career of the Beatles, but never analyzing or explaining or commenting or just seeing things in a larger context, and that's really a shame."
5,gatta have this one,"if you love the Beatles, you have to have this anthology dvd set,for your collection."
5,A must for Beatles fans and anyone else!,This is a fantastic insight in The Beatles reign period. Filled to the top with live performances of their great music in their usual and unusual form. The 5.1 sound is in top quality and does justice to the best rock band the world has ever known. A truly fantastic release on DVD.
5,What? Out of stock!,"I've bought several copies for close friends, and was about to do so again, but I can't find it on any store shelves! Is it really out of production?! If so, why? Oh ,yes, this IS supposed to be a review, isn't it? . . . each of these tapes contains precious moments: among my faves is the opening with the grainy black and white film of John turning to the camera to smile, as the opening words of ""In My Life"" speak to each of us: ""There are places I remember..."", and we see each of the Fabs, and their fans, and a proud and frightened Brian Epstein. This is an awesome tour de force of editing and production which never flags: it's hour after hour of fabness, a masterpiece about masters who created a whole catalog of masterpieces."
5,For the true Beatles fan!,"I bought this as a gift for a good friend who happened to love, love, love the Beatles but did not for some reason have the anthology.This is a collection that has so much footage, so much music on it..it is insane! It's a great, great collectors item especially for the price and he was definitely a very happy person when he received it on his birthday."
4,Seller very accomodating and easy to work with,"I have not tried out the dvd set yet as it was a present for someone else, but during the transaction I encountered multiple shipping problems (due to the post office). The seller was helpful in working with the post office to resolve the problem and ensure that I received my delivery. Seller provided prompt and informative replies to email."
5,"While waiting for the DVD, consider the Laserdisc!","I found a new Pioneer laserdisc version of the Beatles Anthology on the Internet and the quality of the video and sound is quite remarkable. Until the DVD comes out, this laserdisc is worth the investment as used laserdisc players are available for around $200-300. Another nice feature of laserdisc is that there is no copy protection, and one can make a nice copy to play on your VCR."
5,Beatles Afficionado,"I'm 63 and knew where I was when i first heard the Beatles one of the groups that has provided the soundtrack for my life and brought the country out of it's depression after JFK was assasinated. I actually owned the Anthology on VHS so I was just updating it on DVD. Loved, loved, loved it! It's also an historical document as seen through the Beatles development and music. There will never, ever be a group or songwriting team like them and their music crosses all generations. Glad I was able to find it on Amazon."
5,BEATLES ANTHOLOGY,"THIS WAS AN UPDATE OF MY ORIGINAL VIDEO VERSION,WHICH I RECEIVED ON MY 50TH BIRTHDAY,DOS,ENT GET ANY BETTER,HAVE SINCE ORDERED A COPY FOR MY GRANDSON .BEATLES MUSIC WILL GO ON FOR EVER."
3,beatles anthology,"Kind of expected a little more music and a little less history.All in all, it was still interesting, but I would buy into more entertainment the next time."
2,Good dvds,"This is overall a very good product but when I received it, it smelled like cigarette smoke however the DVDs are in perfect working order and look brand new."
1,Meh...,"""I wanna hold your hand""?...""She loves you/Yeah, yeah, yeah""?...""Love me do/You know I love you""?......THESE are meant to be the greatest lyricists of all time?!The baby-boomers who grew-up listening to these nursery-rhymes are remembering them through rose-colored (drug-fueled) glasses...Sorry guys, but the Beatles were a glorified Backstreet Boys. Churning out schlock to the masses. This music sounds INCREDIBLY dated...it is honestly, unlistenable muzak...stuff that you hear blasting out of the grocery-store speakers while you are shopping for Bran Muffins and Depends.Plus, they have more cheesy merchandising than KISS! Beatles lunchboxes...Beatles posters...Beatles pinball machines...ugh, they were sell-outs from the get-go!"
5,oustanding effort,"Reading the editorial review, you may be misled into believing that this is a dry and academic,only for diehards DVD.Wrong, this is an exceptionally well made and researched documentary. And, if anything the first disc, with their pre-fame story, is perhaps the most fascinating disc of the lot. Considering that The ""Fabs"" were the most important and influentual pop/rock group of the 20th. century, I consider this essential viewing, and hugely enjoyable, don't miss out!"
4,A great bargain,"This Beatles Anthology DVD set is a great bargain because when it originally came out in the mid 90's on VHS tapes it was about $120 more. I still have a catalog from then to prove it. I was very impressed with the sound quality. The best sound quality I've ever heard Beatles music presented in. Makes me wish my old Beatles CDs sounded that good. On alot of my other DVD's I have to crank the volume way up to get any decent audio. The only thing I didn't like is that during some of the songs like ""Revolution"" & ""Hey Jude"" there is talking. I'm interested in what they have to say but not during the songs. And it doesn't seem to have a feature where you can just play the music videos. But I guess it's supposed to be a documentary & not a collection of music videos. Also I seem to recall some minor scenes when I saw it on TV in 1995 that weren't on the DVD, like the reunited Beatles in the 90's admiring one of the member's fancy car."
5,Beatle Fan,"This is the best documentary ever made of the most influential Rock and Roll Band. What can be better than a documentary conceived, written and narrated by the Beatles themselves. The fottage is great, especially the rare 1963 concert footage. Overall, an outstanding collection. It will be great when this set is available on DVD."
5,The beatles anthology collector's set VHS: ighta review,"this is the best comprehensive look at the greatest band in the history of music. it contains great behind the scenes footage. if you enjoyed the Anthologies on CD, then you should not pass this up. however, it should be coming out on dvd, so you might want to wait!!"
5,What a video set!,"ah all i can say is get this set , if want to learn more about beatles then listen to the boys themselfs John, Paul , George & Ringo ,and of course their producer George Martin. the only thing that bugged me was the fact that john first wife did'nt show up in this one. oh well if yu want to see her theirs imagine. but all in all if you saw the abc deal in 1996, you only saw half of what's in the video it's that cool. it's totally Gearfab baby! wooooooooo."
5,awsome!!!!,I bought these DVD for my husband who is a big Beatles fan and the day he got them he watched all 5 DVD in two days.....could not get him away from them. said it was the best he has very seem about the Beatles! :)
5,If you want a personal encounter with the Beatles.....,"Such a close encounter with the Beatles! It will make your heart so warm inside, and have U get to know them at more deeper personal level (unless of course...). Just get it!!!! U will C what I mean."
1,Unauthorized biography leaves many questios unanswered,"I found this book to be a light breezy account of the life of Harrison Ford. Because it is unauthorized, there is little insight into the man who is Harrison Ford. Indeed once getting past Ford's rise to stardom, the subsequent chapters give little information that cannot be found in magazines. There is no imput from the people directly in Ford's life, wife, ex-wife, children, Speilberg, Lucas, etc. Overall I found the book wanting."
4,A revealing read about a very private man.,"As a confirmed Harrison Ford fan, I was anxious to read this book once it finally was released. It is aptly titled. This book goes to the core of the man, revealing the talent and traits, some of which are less than admirable. I was glad to read that as Mr. Ford ages he seems to find a more peaceful place within himself. Something new for him. A perfectionist, intense, fiercely loyal and protective of both himself and his family, this book reveals why Harrison Ford is the number one boxoffice draw of the 90's."
3,Just Average,"When I first started reading this book I was pumped! The more I read of it, the more I got tired of it. I am an avid Harrison Ford fan, but most of the contents you can find in any magazine article."
4,Best box yet,"This one seems to be aimed at people like me - fans who have heard all the albums and found them spotty. We don't need everything, and we appreciate the concision of a good set like this ... the best studio material in chronological order, with two live discs to showcase their improv skills. Good choices, good sequencing, excellent sound. Less is definitely more when it's done right. This time Fripp got it right."
3,A GOOD PLACE TO START,"As a fan of KING CRIMSON this is a good place to start if you have heard of them but haven't heard them.It covers a wide range of the many releases during this period.I bought it more for the ""LIVE"" tracks as during the days of vinyl they were non-existant.It would have gotten more stars from me if they wouldn't have [edit] the studio tracks e.i. LARKS TONGUES IN ASPIC part 1 along with others.The violin solo made that track.However,a good set overall especially the live tracks.If you are a CRIMSON-HEAD buy the studio CDs so you won't be disappointed with the [edits]"
2,"Good Introduction, Not For Fans","If you are already a fan of King Crimson, apart from a few live tracks you have probably heard everything that's on here. This is a great way to hear a lot of the classic songs in a really well-mastered format though. In fact, it's a charming little collection for the most part, but it does something I never thought a King Crimson collection would do: edit and abridge the songs!Classics such as Starless, Islands, Exiles and Moonchild have all been cut down! All of my favorite songs are cut down to radio singles; this makes the collection hard to listen to. It might not bother a new fan though, as they don't know what the songs should sound like. Also most of the Lizard album got shafted, kind of lame.This is an ok item for beginners, but as a starting point I would probably recommend getting the 'Young Person's Guide to King Crimson' or the 4-cd live box 'The Great Deceiver' instead."
