5,Harris is the MAN,It is good to be the 100th person to give an awesome review to Harris.This guy is no joke when it comes to taking over your life with the power of discipline. I was down in the dumps and I was not organized at all. I procrastinated so much to the point where it really affected my work and my boss saw it. I googled for a life coach and the first name I saw was Harris Kern. I thought he was going to be another fake but he has good reviews from everyone and from working with him my life is starting to change for the better. I read this book also and I knew I have a lot of work to do to be successful. If you need someone to change your life and actually prove it without a shadow of a doubt. Harris is your guy and his books are the keys to getting your life back.
5,Kern sets a refreshingly unique standard for human performance,"This book is an incredible account of a man who is totally congruent about what true discipline is, and what it takes to achieve it.Having just read Kern's other book, ""Discipline: Training the Mind to Manage Your Life"", what I appreciate is that Kern doesn't ""mainstream"" his work. In both books, he tells it like it is.In a raw and unwavering format, he writes about the sacrifice and commitment needed to acquire discipline...backed up by his own personal biography. Offering a six step strategy, his enthusiasm and passion for self motivation is contagious. You can't help but be inspired."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"Ok, I submit a review previously, blasting this book, but for ""some reasons"" it never got posted here. To show you how strongly I feel against this book, I am taking the effort of posting my advice up again! Please please please don't buy this book. I wonder if the people who gave it high rating, esp. the FIVE STARS!, have actually read this book!? I had and regretted it. Try reading ALL the recommendations before you buy this book.It is NOT about self discipline at all! It is a self indulgent exercise about Kern's life and his ""achievements"". One of which is apparently this book! And I am contributing to it! Doh!!!! There is nothing here that can help you to become a more disciplined person. The only thing that is not atrocious about it is the high school level writing, which makes this a very fast read. I didn't have to invest a lot of time into this mockery. It felt like he was thumbing his nose at me while I am reading this. Beware, you have been warned."
4,Waiting around for a miracle?,"I read this book, as well as the 2nd book in the series and loved them! Mr. Kern's and Ms. Willi's straight foward approach works.[...]These books tell you over and over again that you have to want it AND earn it, and that means sacrifices! To all those waiting around for a miracle - it's up to you to make something happen with your life. You have to EARN it. It doesn't come easily and Mr. Kern reiterates that over and over again in his books."
5,I'm trying to stay on the right path towards discipline!,I recently read this book and would recommend it to anyone who realizes that change will NOT be easy. Change is difficult! I know because I've tried to make major improvements in my life several times by being more disciplined. Unfortunately I failed miserably every time! I'm hopeful that if I stay on the right path this time as outlined by your book I will be successful.So far so good! Thanks.
5,An outstanding overview of philosophy.,"This book is an excellent overview of philosophy. The writing is of the highest standard: each essay is written with clarity and grace. Moreover, the entries contain cross-references to other entries, where appropriate, and ends with suggestions for further reading. Moreover, there is a glossary at the end of the book, which novices should find particularly useful. Highly recommended--a required addition to every philosophy collection"
4,"Half History, Half Philosophy","Blackwell's Companion to Philosophy is a mixture of both philosophy and history. Unlike say, Oxford's Companion to Philosophy (which is more like a dictionary with entries in alphabetical order) it is a mix of topical (e.g. Philosophy of xxxxx) and historical essays.Personally I found the first section to be typical philosophy - the essays are characteristicly dense but it does the job. I found the history of philosophy section much more easier to go through as it broke things down according to chronology and philosophers (as I like it!).As always, mileage may vary - you might find this helpful or not so according to what you are looking for."
3,Helpful but Lacking,"I read through this book a few times to help me recall and extend my ability in French grammar. I found it very useful in helping me attain a decent level of proficiency in a short period of time; however, it lacked certain elements of French grammar. Ultimately this deficiency led me to buy Berlitz's French Grammar Handbook.I don't agree with the cover of the book when it states that it contains everything needed for speaking and comprehension. It would have been helpful if it contained such elements as the pronoun usage of y and en as well as a mention of the past historic tense. When I tried to read _Le Petit Prince_ with the aid of this Resnick's book, I had trouble making out some of the sentences, but after purchasing the Berlitz book, I didn't have any problems."
2,Incompetent Instruction Book Writers,"It is a travesty that programmers create a good game that customers cannot fully enjoy because some incompetent writer/editor decides not to include from some very important instructions. The instruction book fails to provide information on the basic game set up, i.e. how do I set it up for two players, what do those profiles mean, how do I play on the same team, etc. It is completely frustrating and reduces the enjoyment of the game. I understand how to use the game controls, passing, running, etc. Granted, I have played numerous video games, but this is the first sports one I have purchased, so I am probably not familiar with the sports game set up lingo. I am not the only person that purchased this game without purchasing NFL 06, NFL 05, etc. It is the writers responsibility to provide the information and they failed."
2,Disturbingly Hard To Control,Its very difficult to control this game. Don't be cheap and buy the newer Madden for Wii. Its much better to control.
4,The game is a kick besides kicking.,"It's an EA title. If you're on this page, you know what to expect from this game. People complain about the graphics, but really graphics are secondary to what this game is all about... ""the throwing motion"" as QB is awesome. It's hard to want to do running plays, with how sweet it is to switch WR's as you drop back. It draws you into the game unlike any madden/football game has before.That being said... the kicking is a little absurd. I have been practicing it... but basically they make it far too sensative. I realize the desire to make kicking a challenge with a Wii-remote, but it's the NFL... kickers are money... the controls on kicking shouldn't be so demanding, if you aren't rigid as heck with your kicking motion (especially on kickoffs) you hook is so badly, the likes of which I've never seen from an NFL kicker, and this can happen 2-3 times a game.but the feeling of throwing alone gives this title a solid 4 stars."
4,Quality Game,Madden was the first game I bought for Wii and I am proud to have done so. The controls take a little while to learn but they are all very intuitive and even fun to do. I always stand up while I play this game because I get so into the game. The game only gets better when you add multiple people to it.Overall this game is exactly what I'd expect from a Madden game. It's great fun but can get old if you play it too much and aren't that into football.I definitely recommend you buy this game.
4,"Great game, but get Madden NFL 08 instead","Even though I haven't played it, you should consider purchasing Madden NFL 08 instead of 07 because there are many more features, like online play, ehanced controls, and many more minigames.For 07, I really enjoy it, but the motion controls don't always work, so it might be a hassle for begginers."
4,le pongo 4 estrellas porque puede dar mas,"Bueno, va en ascenso, pero puede dar más todavía. Lo mejor del CD es RAPTA LA MONA, es una pista para escucharla a todo volumen, realmente lo mejor que ha hecho desde Arena Hash"
4,Excelentes temas relacionados con la realidad actual,"Temas que nos hablan de lo que pasa la juventud actual y su continuo impulso para seguir viviendo, esta bien esquematizado y tiene ritmo para bailar."
2,some technical faults in this set,"Both discs state REGION 4, but they play on every DVD unit I've tried them in. The theatrical version (disc one) apparently is sped up about five percent -- I didn't notice it at first, but when it came in at just over two hours, I went back and discovered the alteration. Not too noticable, but you can tell the voices are modulated about a tone higher than normal, and the physical actions are a bit too fast. Still, it's watchable. Disc two is the TV cut, and the transfer is very disapointing. Pretty muddy and dim. Not nearly as clear as disc one, which really isn't a high quality transfer either. I had high hopes for this, since the US seems to miss out on every extended package on all things DUNE. The box and liner jackets are cool, but overall this was a let down. Wait for the expanded version due out soon...if they really DO issue it this time around!"
4,Arrow that hits the mark,"I read this book to my daughter as we studied the formation of the thirteen colonies of America. The gracious and touching story of the Quaker family brought home to us some of their views and ideologies in a far better way than a essay on the matter would have done. Reading the cameo of the Native American boy and his world painted thoughtfully in the story, we felt like we had been given a tiny peek into their world of thoughts, values and ways. The interaction between the Native Americans and the Quakers then came as a beautiful culmination to the build up and we came away feeling like we had been there. A well written and thought-provoking book. I would read it again."
4,A work of cow-loving intellect,"As an urban person living in a condo, I appreciated the wit and the cow stories. There is drama, humor, and significance in cow history, let none deny it. However, I found the degree of detail on methods of artificial insemination, calving, and Scotish cow bloodlines to be rather rather beyond my capacities. Clearly, the complexity of breeding for avoidance of unhelpful resessive traits helps make cow farming a truly intellectual challenge."
3,Good to a Point,"This is a good history on angus cattle. I gave it as a christmas gift and it seems to be quite excellent. I do have one problem with it. At the very beginning it starts out talking of the creation of the cow by way of evolution. Since I don't believe in the evolutionary theory, I had to make a note of that to the person to whom I gave it, who believes in the creationist theary as I do. That's the only reason I gave the book 3 stars. It's just a note for creationists or others who may not agree with the evolutionary theory."
5,Beautiful music!,This has got to be one of my favorite cd's! The blending between composition and improvisation is seamless and totally organic. Definitely music for the heart and soul.
5,fantastic sound from a relatively unknown band,"Heard these guys in a small bar in Portland several years ago, bought the CD. Wore it out & bought another- have given it as gifts so friends could enjoy it as well. Its music that is timeless, and tireless. My personal favorites are Steel Blue Eyes, and Little Saigon. Another Portland band, no longer together- Little Women have a cool blues sound- if you get the chance buy Radish Head at any price- you won't be disappointed."
2,who knows what they are talking about,"i like aaliyah as much as the next person and thought the dvd would be good i still don't know seeing as i haven't bought or seen it, you should buy it and see for yourself then return it if you hate it . It won't hurt to see for yourself, plus i've been reading reviews about how , she did bad things in her personal life that were talked about on the dvd, what things i 'm going crazy wondering what these people are talking about so i'm gonna buy it and find out. Maybe some people think they shouldn't dirty up her memory since she is gone now, but i have to know i look up to this person iwant to know if i write a report on aaliyah being my #1 role model , if people will think i am smart or a !!!@&% with no morals.I'd rather not be ignorant about it all"
1,Losing Aaliyah,"I am a big fan of Aaliyah and this is a poor video prepared by folks who evidently don't share the same opinion of her. First of all, the video looks like a home video, certainly not of a professional quality. Its definitely not worth the money. Secondly, the narrator stated that the name of Aaliyah's first single on her self-titled album was Revolution. (It's ""We Need A Resolution"")I found this offensive. There were several mistakes like this. They solicited people on the street who obviously were not fans or who were not familar with her. If the video was $5.00, you could waste your money. Obviously, the makers of this are trying to make money off the grief of Aaliyah's fans, so I don't recommend that you buy. Aaliyah's continues to have a hugh fan base who will spend money to have something to which to remember her. I would not make the makers rich off of this video."
1,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed with my purchase. Just as others have said the video is not professional, not put together well at all and the profanity i can't even comment on that. Truth be told this is not a tribute to a beautiful person, it's an insult. Some parts of the video had poor sound as well as picture quality. I can't believe Amazon is standing behind this product and is selling it to their customers just to make a buck. Then they have a no return policy on something as thrashy as this."
1,DVD,I absolutely love Aaliyah just like many of you out there but I found this DVD to be a waste of money. This DVD is how others view her life and death. There are a few pictures of Aaliyah on this DVD but hardly.
1,i really was disappointed,"i love aaliyah and her work, that is why i had to run and get the dvd. when i found out it was an limited edition, that made me search more and more. i recived this as christmas gift and thought i'm one of the lucky fews. as i viewed it i was so upset. as fans we could have done a better job and even include more pics of her. maybe even music. so like another customer reported it was not made professionally and not through her family..if u lover her work u will not care to much but i find that the dvd released with her latest album is so much better...run and get ""I care 4 U""...."
1,losing aaliyah,this video was not professional at all. It was a home movie.I was offended when some of the people were blaming her boyfriendfor the accident.Thats crazy.I will be returning this.not to mention all the cuss words.
2,Bad Dvd,"I made the biggest mistake of buying this dvd before reading the reviews. However, when I got it I watched and, when it was over I was speechless! I couldn't believe someone would make a dvd of AALIYAH look sooooo bad. I just have to say, don't waste your money. If I were u, I'd get the I Care 4 U dvd or the other Aaliyah cd with the bonus dvd."
1,The jacket is misleading...,"I have been searching for a DVD of Aaliyah's collection of videosI have been unsuccessful. I bought this DVD judging by what it said on the jacket. But the chronicle was a commentary, not her work.I was disappointed because I wanted her work.The jacket is misleading. The DVD is strictly a Eulogy. Nothing more, nothing less."
2,Not what I wanted!,This is a third or forth party tribute about the star that was not very impressive. Although surely a heartfelt loss by those filming it a 10yr old could of produced better quality. This is probably something you could add to your collection if you are a person that must have everything Aaliyah. Otherwise don't bother most of the people being interviewed are nobody you've ever heard of or care to pay attention to. Not what I was expecting.....
1,Get This Only If You're A Super Huge Aaliyah Fan,"As a huge Aaliyah fan, I was very disapointed with this DVD. I was expecting old interviews with her, not an exaggerated number of five hours of what she meant to many people. It's great that she had that many people whom had loved her, but they shouldn't have created something solely on that. Don't buy this."
3,Aaliyah,"The documentary was ok, It just didnt have enough information . was there really an argument between the passengers and the pilot. why was everbody so much in a rush? It just was not enough information, there are so many unanswerd questions. I do agree with one of the guys on the video when he said she shouldn't have been on no crop plane. she should been on a jet it doesn't make sense.makes me angry."
2,Not very good,I didn't like this dvd because it just shows the fans and I thought that they would have Aaliyah on there talking form previous shows and interviews. It could have did a whole lot better. Save your money.
2,Oh Boy!,"This video was a disappointment. After waiting quite some time to buy and view it, I was mostly in shock as I watched it. It is obviously a [poor]production, with numerous mistakes and misinformation. The narrator cannot even pronounce names correctly, though the people he refers to are famous and widely known (and have simple names!). This rushed video has very few moments or sequences worth any fan's time. The interview with the unidentified music industry insider was a surprise! He actually said a thing or two worth pondering..."
1,A waste is a terrible thing to mind,"Personally, I didn't see the DVD, and after reading what loyal fans find trashy and disrespectful, I'm glad I didn't. I don't care what her personal life consisted of. All I know is that one of the most beautiful, talented treasures of this earth is gone.So instead of trashing her name and making her seem like her life and legacy never meant anything to her family, friends and fans,we ought to be happy that she doesn't have to experience the down fall of being bound by a world that is slowly destroying itself."
1,Losing Aaliyah Dvd was a BIG disappointment,I've been an Aaliyah fan from her beginning. I was extremely saddened by her death. I bought this DVD hoping it would be a nice addition to my collection of Aaliyah items. It is the worse piece of a documentary I've ever seen. It spits out incorrect information and mis pronunciations of names in almost every utterance. The only somewhat enjoyable piece was the fan expressions on their feelings about Aaliyah. Don't waste your time or money! What an awful way to make money over such a tragic event
1,Aaliyah's family should sue.,"This is DVD is a waste of time and money, full of foul mouthed people and cheesy pictures, Aaliyah's probably rolling in her grave. The person who did this is trying to profit off her death.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!"
1,Losing Aaliyah,"I STRONGLY agree with the sentiments of others who have voiced their DISGUST in this being one of the WORST ""docu-mockeries"" that I have seen. I too purchased this as a Christmas gift for someone, and was thoroughly DISAPPOINTED in the content which had no relevance to her career and the impact she had on the music and film world. The production company should be ashamed of how they have exploited and desecrated the memory of Aaliyah and her family, just to make a quick buck! Warning: Purchase at your own risk!"
1,very bad,"i thought this would be a movie about her life with interviews and video clips, it's not! talks to ""fans"" random people and asks them what they thought about her, is not video clips. (pictures) very disapointed!"
2,Beware of corrosiveness,Being a lover of Meguiars products it was natural for me to purchase this product for my chrome wheels on my corvette. After washing the car I sprayed this on 2 wheels at a time then washed them gently and the chrome looked great. As I was drying the car I noticed my drilled slotted brake rotors were totally discolored and spotted. They are zinc plated to prevent rust and they were perfect before washing. I have been sick about this ever since. Read the label later and there is a warning that this material is corrosive. Great time to find out. Who would have thought that a cleaner for chrome would dissolve a zinc plated rotor. Plain soap and water from now on.
2,Peeled off the chrome,"One wheel shines like a mirror. The other does too, but the chrome peeled off in a few locations! This is potent, be careful. Perhaps my car had old chrome coating, I have a PT 2005 17/6 Alloy."
3,Journeymen Jazz,"This collection of six diverse jazz talents is a joy to listen to and swing to, from big band to trio. There are no breakthroughs or innovations going on, but joyous and exhuberant performances nonetheless. I especially liked the piano and organ trios of Ahmad Jamal and Wild Bill Davis. This is music anyone can enjoy, or even dance to. Okeh had a great roster of blues, R&B, jazz and rock artists."
1,below standard pillow,"This pillow is the first thing I ever returned to Amazon. If it actually has any goose down in it I would be surprised. I can see dark feathers through the ticking. Also, on both sides near the center, there is (approximately 4 inches square) a section of hard, plasticized, material that is uncomfortable to lay your cheek on. In addition, the pillow is undersized. I do not recommend this pillow to anyone. Comfortable it is not. Luxurious it definitely is not."
2,Chills.....yeah right!,"I rushed home to cdnow/amazon to purchase FattyKoo's cd. I'd heard the song Chills, and was floored with delight. I just knew that the entire album was worth ordering. I arrived home some days later and found that it had arrived and ripped it open. To my complete discuss, the ablum only had maybe 2 good songs on it. I believe, the young lady who sings on the song chills should go solo. Vocally she's the best."
3,Interesting but cold.,"Eisner's latest graphic novel is a sweeping, episodic study of the rise and fall of a prominent German Jewish family over several generations. It focuses on the way that marriage and children serve to build, trade on, and maintain the family's social prominence. Reminiscent of Booth Tarkington's THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, it's an absorbing story, but it's difficult to feel any emotional connection to the characters. Eisner's artwork is slicker than ever, but the odd use of prose text segments that information that could and should've been conveyed either in art and dialogue or in conventional captions is jarring, and sometimes makes the artwork (which could've used larger reproduction, in any case) feel squeezed. It's a peculiar choice for an author who's always been such a strong advocate of the storytelling potential of the medium. A richly observed drama, but not up to the high standards set by Eisner's best work."
3,Looks good but...,The hitch works fine and is pretty well hidden but the one they sent me has a slightly crooked tube. Looks a little off especially with a bike rack attached. Not sure if Amazon gets all the slight defect hitches or I was just unlucky.
4,finally,"I saw this film on Movies On Demand last week and have been thinking about it ever since.A true testament to the importance of this film is that Rosario Dawson and Bloc Party go out on a limb to support Stephen Marshall's uncovering of the most appalling administration of this century. That being said......movie stars and rock bands dont always make the best poster-children, but in this case they do.The performances (newcomer Nathan Crooker especially) show grit and integrity - which is not only refreshing but absolutely integral when the true star of this film is the message, and it shines very very hot."
3,A Great Concept with a Bad Producer,"Overall the film was pretty solid as far as content goes. Rosario Dawson shines and her costars range from great (Immortal Technique) to mediocre (Nathan Crooker). The concept of the film is certainly different from other left-leaning productions; it takes on corporate journalistic manipulation of facts in the name of profit. The topic matter has often been the subject matter of Noam Chomsky books and documentaries, but never quite dramatized like in This Revolution.Unfortunately the film suffered from poor production. As a small budget activist film I wasn't expecting Speilberg-esk production, but even for a low-budget film the quality felt poor. At times it was so bad it felt like a mockumentary. All-in-all I did enjoy the film and wish productions of similar subject matter were more prevalent."
3,Mediocre,"Rather disappoint from the star of Spike Lee's 25 Hours, but still somewhat interesting. Would not rush out and purchase it, however."
1,Another anti-war protest movie?,"I love Rosario Dawson but this one bit the dust. Being an O.I.F. 1 veteran myself, I'm getting sick and tired of no brainers making anti-war protest movies. Our military combined is doing their best to fight terrorism and these protesters don't appreciate anything. Don't waste your time or money."
5,facinating read,"This is an obviously well researched book that is an excellent read. The author has an unique ability to take facts and make them come to life in her narrative. Though the book is obviously a work of non-fiction, it reads so easily that it feels more like a great novel. It is chock full of information that will be interesting to both lovers of the opera as well as those like me who new little about the world behind the ""gold curtain"". Once I started it, I couldn't put it down."
3,Pretty Good,"This book shines in its early history of the Metropolitan Opera, and it is quite interesting to follow this history to the present day. Most of the information, however, is new only to opera novices, not to those who have closely followed the opera scene for years.While the stated purpose of the book is to give the reader a behind-the-scenes look at the administration of the Met, there are simply too many omissions of important performers and their contributions to make this a truly satisfying read. In short, this book could have been greatly enriched with more anecdotes about the performers who make the opera what it is. This is not to slight the administrators, many of whom did amazing work in building the Met. But a more complete picture would have been far more interesting, and for this reason, I was disappointed in this book."
3,Interesting history,"I enjoyed this book, thought it interesting from historical standpoint especially regarding the administration of the Met. I also didn't know about the dire financial problems over the years. However, those expecting alot of gossip and dirt on the stars are going to be disappointed as there really isn't much other than a few ego trips and the poor diva behavior of Marton and Battle, known already in the opera world. I found the board member stuff new to me as I don't read the NY Times that closely over the years. Levine and Volpe became more interesting after reading the book and I can only hope for many more years of success in spite of some really incompetent management over the years. Obviously, running this show is not an easy job and it seems the author respects Volpe's abilities. If he retires, maybe this is a job for Rudy!! If you like the art form and the Met it is worth a read."
4,"Not about music, but the world of opera","Ms. Fiedler, apart from being the daughter of Arthur Fiedler, has written a fascinating book about the Metropolitan Opera. She writes very well about a subject too little is known about. Not ""who sang the best 'Turandot,'"" but what went in behind the curtains, so to speak.The well-known Rudolf Bing is only part of the story; for the famous singers that either made the Met their home, or played there for one season are most of the story.Very entertaining, and educational. I heartily recommend her book."
2,Tired old stories cobbled together by Levine Worshipper,"While I was happy that this book avoided the calculatedly catty tone of Hoelterhoff's misbegotten ""Cinderella and Co."", most of it reads like a Met tour guide's script. The description of one Met impresario succeeding another reads like those interminable 'this one begat that one, who begat that one, etc' parts of the Bible. And those worn out old stories about Kathleen Battle's bad behavior have been repeated so many times that every community college freshman voice major is weary of them.Plus all the parts about Maestro Levine sound like they were written by Aunt Bea if she were Levine's publicist. ""Oh, Andy! Can you believe these dreadful things they are saying about Jimmy!"" It's as though the only times that Fiedler took her hand away from her pearls was to speed dial Levine and submit her latest draft for his approval."
4,The drama is behind the scenes!!,"The subtitle ""The Mayhem Behind the Music at the Metropolitan Opera"" says it all. Johanna Fiedler, the daughter of the Boston Pop's Arthur Fiedler, brings an insider's eye to the New York Metropolitan Opera. Beginning with the attempts to provide society with a place to be seen, and perhaps also enjoy opera, the Met has been a showplace of great talent and ego. On both sides of the curtain, and stagelights for that matter. To keep such an artictic company running it has taken mant talents from the management talent of Rudolf Bing to the mecurial brillance of Kathleen Battle. This well written tome brings it to the reader, warts and all. This is an engaging read for any lover of the Saturday broadcasts , as well as any lover of theatre and opera."
4,Molto Agitato review,"I was very interested in reading about the history of the metropolitan opera. I was surprised at all the inhouse fighting that went on, but learned how that led to the production choices, singer choices and conductor choices. I also found it interesting to read about the different main characters and their influence in the ""mayhem"" behind the scenes. The summary at the end of the reading was also helpful in keeping the time frame organized. As a Juilliard graduate I found the book very enjoyable. I don't know if the general public would like this book. They might find it somewhat boring. However, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in opera and classical music in general."
3,interesting in the beginning.......,"I am not an Opera lover to the extent that several of the other reviewers are so my review is not as harsh. I would have loved to give this book 4 stars but it was getting a little old by the end. For me, it was full of interesting and sometimes humorus stories that I had not heard before. However, by the end of the book, the political stories were old and repetative. I would have enjoyed more saucy stories about the people of the met and less about how the rich patrons fought with the management. For so many people, that's not exciting - that's life. SO I say it's a good read if you're a moderate opera fan but you may want to find a used version."
1,I want my money back!,This book was a big bore! What a rip-off! Cobbled together from other anecdotes Opera lovers have heard and read elsewhere. The writer must be trading on her father's famous name. Obviously talent wasn't passed aong in the genes!
3,Informative but boring,"As a relatively new opera fan, I looked forward to reading this book. While it's interesting, it's very dry and fairly boring. There's not much new here. I'm just learning about opera and even I had heard many of the stories in this book. It's a good history of the Met, but not much more."
2,Confused,The instruction was great but the dances listed outside are not the same as on the dvd. it also came with a cd with songs that don't go to the dances on the dvd. may be a packaging error.
1,IncraKnows,"Incra knows not quality! Purchasers beware!If Incra knows of an issue such as third party packaging and delivery of its products, why does it not take steps to minimize its customers' exposure to damaged products? Rather than be proactive Incra chooses to risk its reputation by ignoring known issues such as indicated by Linda Berger with respect to third party suppliers, and, as indicated by Perry McDaniel with respect to Incra's own packaging of its products that highly exposes the fence mouting bracket to damage.What a shame the elegance of Incra engineering is not accompanied with even marginal quality control or reasoned customer service."
1,Very disappointed!,I purchased the Incra TSIII-32 with high hopes because I have other Incra tools and I am very happy with the way they perform. But this TSIII-32 is poorly engineered and a real pain in the neck to use. I wish I never had purchased it. It was a pain to put together and is a pain to keep aligned. Think long and hard before buying this piece of equipment!
2,Do Not feel any better,I really do not see any difference in my body. It is not working for me. Will not order this product again.
2,disappointed | Guess you get what you pay for... in this case not much,"The velcro does not stay on my ankle over my pants and does not adjust to many sizes. It is certainly more reflective than non reflective clothing as they state in the listing, however, it is NOT very reflective compared to Vedante POP BANDS or Jog Lite bands. If you are spending money to be safe and visible at night I suggesting purchasing another brand."
2,Just barely long enough,"They are just barely long enough to fit around a pair of denims. They are bright, but that does not matter if you cannot wear them. I guess they would be fine if you always cycle in shorts and have small ankles, but if you wear long pants or have large ankles, these will not work. Difficult for me and my son to put on - kinda defeats the purpose of encouraging him to wear them.I am going to extend them by sewing on more hook and loop fabric. I would get different, longer ankle bands."
2,Only for Small Books!!,"After reading the one review on this site I ordered the bookmateand eagerly awaited it as I was using a Fellowes plastic bookstand for my softcover textbooks. When it arrived I was sorely disappointed. The back support for the book measures only about 7""x7"" and the depth measurement for the book is 1"".Any substantial softcover textbook whose frame is larger than 7""x7"" is going to have its pages flop over backward because the stand isn't big enough. In addition, because the depth is only 1"", forget any book with say over 500 pages. At least the Fellowes stand has a back support of 12"" x 9"", its deficiency is its page holding arms. I can't see how anyone using a an average sized cookbook, as perhaps this amazon category is targeted, could use this bookmate usefully."
4,Great purchase,"After recently returning to school, I was quickly reminded how tough reading textbooks is on one's neck, especially while trying to take notes at the same time. After looking at several other book stands, this seemed to be the best choice. I haven't had any trouble with my textbooks - both hardcover and softcover. Even if you're not experiencing neck pain from reading, it's a good idea to create a more ergonomic study space for yourself. It also should be especially useful for those working on smaller desktops that need to have a notebook or binder open as well. I'm sure this stand could also be useful when retyping documents as well."
3,WELL-MADE BUT NO AS COMFY,"THE SHOES ARE SO WELL MADE, BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED. I BOUGHT A SIZE SMALLER AS ONE OF THE REVIEWERS SUGGESTED. SO, I HAVE TO SEND THE SHOES BACK. BUT, I WILL TRY ANOTHER PAIR OF MERRELL, SINCE THE DR. SUGGESTED IT."
2,not as advertised,"I had high hopes for these shoes. I am in and out of airport security several times a week, and have had great luck with a pair of men's Merrell slip ons. This pair did not hold up nearly as well. The antimicrobial/anti odor was a joke. My feet do not smell, but within 3 days of wearing these, they did. I was never able to get rid of the odor, despite using different foot sprays and clean feet. Also, they scuff incredibly easy. A shoe polish lasts about a day. If you don't care how they look, they are reasonably comfortable, however there is some lateral instability that may not work with some knees for walking of any length. Definitely will not purchase these again."
2,Xmas present for niece and they broke Christmas day,She wasn't playing rough with them. They are kinda cool put I think they are made of pewter and on crumbled in half.
3,Good for a few bucks,"These are oddly shaped but very strong magnets. They do a few kooky things, but they're still just magnets. If your kids are the type to sit and play with magnets or other small curiosities they find, then they'd like this."
4,"neat little magnets, not for 3 or younger","these are great little magnets,but keep away from anyone who would put them in there mouth."
1,The worst Bag,This could be the worst bag one could ever see in this world.If it is made for a laptop it should have enough padding to protect the laptop.Otherwise why would people spend money and buy laptop cases ?Using this and using a polythene bag from walmart or albersons after grocery purchase is the same !!!
5,Great Illustrations,Well SOme weeks ago I purchased a Tibetian Painting while I was in Nepal and was introduced to purchased this book and found the excact painting was in it I was shocked. The book explains in great details every stroke and every medicine plant and items painted on my tanka more meaningful.Highly regarded book if you are into Tibetian Medicinal paintings.Calvin
1,Bad job,"The author of this book is an egomaniacal, gossipy gabber. Inbetween blurbs about Doris, he gives a complete plot description of her films, interspersing gossip about the other stars. I do not appreciate reading about HIS childhood; he took this opportunity to recount facets of his life, instead of focusing on the celebrity of whom he purports to be fan. He does her other fans a disservice by wating our time with non-Doris Day info. I got about 1/4 the way thru this book and discarded it for the junk it is. As far as I'm concerned, Mr. Braun owes me $9.95."
1,I never throw a book in the trash...,"...but that's where this one went. I've never read a more poorly written, sycophantic, piece of embarrassing drivel than this ""biography"" of Doris Day. The archaic, obseqious style is neauseating and could never have been authorized by Ms. Day, I surmise, if the sweet little octegenarian weren't a little dotty herself, making her and this ""author"" very compatible. If you are the least bit literate and hate wasting money, move on."
3,50's pop,"I only bought this for two cuts to replace a couple of scratched ""45's"". The cuts I wanted are good, but I was surprised to find a couple of other credible recordings on the anthology CD. Very good rendition of Bobby Darin's ""Dream Lover"" and the Cadillac's ""Speedo"". This definitely only a CD for lover's of the 50's pop music that, unlike today's, had intelligible lyrics without all the inane runs done today."
1,Bunch of crap,"Lousy book. Lots of poorly conceived ideas. The author is riding a bull market, and when it ends, so will his stock market strategies."
2,Losing money at the moment,"I started investing in the market in January and am currently losing money following the Unemotional Growth method. I am hoping that things will get better, but the method does not seem to follow a ""buy low, sell high"" philosophy that other methods in the Fool do. Doesn't the Value Line summary of 100 most timely companies list companies that have ALREADY DONE WELL? Which means that you will most likely get in when the market is high and wind up losing money when the market goes down (this has happened to me). I think I will have to get out of this method after coming as close to my buying prices as I think possible and try a different way of doing things. Also, it was disappointing to find that the Unemotional Value method in his book may not be as effective as the Foolish Four on the web site. I need more information than is given in the book in order to make money in the stock market."
5,A valuable book to any level of investor,This clearly written book shows you through examples of real stocks and numbers how to beat the market and all mutual funds. This book has a very real approach to investing and is very easy to read and understand. The systems they use and the numbers they come up with you can check yourself in the stock section of your local paper. A trully remarkable book for those seeking large long term gains without hours of research and experience in trading or those who just want to study a trully unique and profitable way to invest.
2,Not worth the price of the book,Sheard's knowledge of statistics is evidently very poor. His backtesting of stock market data demonstrates a lack of understanding of statistics. Don't confuse a bull market with stock market expertise. Don't buy this book.
2,Little Dry,I had to skip the first few chapters 'cause he kept talking about his personal life and blah blah. I finally get through that and it starts off w/ Kindergarten level investing. I read through a few more chapters and then I had to let it go. Not for me but not necessarily a bad book.
1,A Waste of Money,"After reading numerous investment books, I consider this one a total waste of money. It consists of long chapters, with little topic division, which are a rehash of information available for free on the Motley Fool web site. It as if the author was trying hard to write enough words to make the number his publisher required to call it a book. The author should have completed his Ph.D. in English literature and continued teaching."
4,A good buy for those interested in investment strategy.,"A simple, straightforward guide to both Value and Growth investing. Easy to follow guide to the otherwise complicated intricaties of investment strategy written for the layperson who wants to understand the ins and outs of investment strategy."
1,Highly Disappointed in this book,"This book consisted of nothing I hadn't already heard, and there was very little of that. It had nothing new, and nothing I didn't pick up from my own working experience. It offered no solutions to problems that exist in the workplace.When I read these reviews, I hope that the information will save me money by allowing me to avoid poor book choices. Along with others here, I hope you save your time and money."
2,Not Readily Impressed,"I read the book, and don't understand why these people seem to be excited about this book. I have read many books in this genre, and feel this one falls far below the even the average read. The information is obvious, and seems to be the same old BS that comes from executives that want things to remain exactly the same as they have always benn. Nothing new or enlightening here."
1,"The Interviews are much less than forthcoming, with no Info.","This book is based on what is pretty much useless interviews. Getting information from an interview is predicated on the fact you can trust the individual you are interviewing to give you decent, accurate, and trustworthy information. None of those premises are met with any of the interviews/interviewees in the book. At no time did any interviewee give me information beyond what you would get in a corporate memo regarding corporate policy (or direction), or the information you receive from HR when they are convincing you to work for the company in the first place. There are demographics given, but without more information they are as good as any statistical data that can be manipulated to meet the needs of any desired outcomes. This book offers nothing on what an employee can actually do to improve, or further his/her career. I agree with some of the other reviewers. I would rather spend my time and money on something else."
2,Not that Great,"I bought this in an airport and read it on a plane. It is not a great book. As another reviewer said, it tells you to work hard, pretty much tells you that if you want to succeed you will have no life. I subscribe to the 80/20 Principle and think Richard Koch's 80/20 Principle and the 80/20 Individual will take you further."
3,Fortune 500 Executives,"Surprising, interesting, insightful work. Author accounts for her methodology up front. A good look into the psychology of corporate leadership. Author went to a lot of trouble to present this information to the public. Very easy read."
1,"Propaganda for bosses, Author hired by Fortune 500 Executives",This book simply ask workder to work harder and harder. No advise on how to protect themselves from unfair workplace treatments.
5,A stellar effort from a timeless group!!,"I have to admit the teaser's of the title tune I had seen previewed on TV attracted my attention. While I was at our local music store, this album was one of the albums they had available in one of those preview thingies with the headphones. As I jumped from song to song, I realized it wasn't just the title song that was good, but that every song was a winner. My personal favorite on this CD is Walking on Air because it just makes me feel good. Hell, the whole album makes me feel good. Glad to see these stars of the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's moving on into the 21st century and collecting new fans along the way."
5,Why Didn't This Album Sell Better?,"I really loved it. ""This Is Where I Came In,"" is so very infectious! I kept seeing people in the supermarket almost dancing when it played. I loved ""Sacred Trust,"" ""She Keeps On Coming Back For More,"" ""Man in the Middle,"" and Wedding Day.""I don't know anything about the technicality of music or music production; however, I really enjoy hearing all of the songs every time I play them, which is over and over! I also bought the DVD!"
5,Ageless Sound,"This is where I came in is a primo cd. I haven't listened to the Bee Gees in about 20 years. After catching A&E's One Night Only, I ordered this CD. This is one of the best CD's I own. It has quickly become one of my favorites. My kids like it too. The Bee Gees' music is ageless. Everyone remembers them and kids are experiencing quality music and song writing at a time when most groups are re-recording anything they can pay copyrights for. They are an amazing group and this CD is incredible. The Wedding Day song makes me want to get married all over again just to have it played at my wedding. It's a shame that the Bee Gees aren't more popular in the US market. The States are missing out on one of musics classic groups."
4,Fantastic!,"I love this CD, every track is unique! I love that each brother had their own music in this CD, working independently, and yet their collaboration on several songs is wonderful. It is amazing that they still are doing what they love, and what they do SO well. BRAVO Barry, Maurice, and Robin!! :)"
3,Typically Spotty Post 80s Gibb Effort,"I'm as big a fan as anyone but don't believe these inflated, 5-star reviews. I think our boys really need an outside producer to help shape their material and vocals. For a trio so known for their soaring harmonies, there are only a couple of tracks that show them off. Someone needs to tell Barry that his breathy vocal style is just too precious. Just sing the song! You know how! And there's a certain lack of warmth to most of the album, too much techno production and drum machines. On the positive side, it's a big improvement over the mediocre Still Waters and this one gets through seven straight listenable and enjoyable tracks before running into a truly terrible one (Maurice's WALKING ON AIR). Again, don't believe the rave 5-star reviews. If you are like me and think their material has been hit-and-miss since their ONE cd came out, then this one won't surprise you."
1,This is where I came in???,"I've been a BeeGees fan for 20 years now. I reviewed their ""Living Eyes"" album and said it stunk. That it was the worst they'd ever done.I take it all back. THIS album is the worst they have ever done. One word to sum it up....YUCK! I hear songs that are goofy, ridiculous and nonsensical.I don't hear the ""back to basics"" sound that Barry Gibb has described. In comparison to their work from the 60's and 70's, this album doesn't do it for me.I played the album all the way through, one time, to give it a chance.The only song that I can tolerate is the title track. The rest is garbage.I never thought that I would say this, but, guys, it's time to retire. I think you've used up all of your ideas. It's time to spend more time at home with the wife and kids."
4,Good album,"While I am a die-hard BeeGees fan, there is one song on this album that irks me. But the rest are golden melodies. And if you are lucky enough to have the CD that plays as a DVD, the Video is really fun. It takes you back a long time ago (when they were quite young) and much later when they were all grown men, horsing around. That's why I gave it 4 Stars, there was no 4 and 1/2 Stars. When all is said and done, it is a very good album."
4,"After 4 years, better late than never!","You've never heard the Gibbs like this before, and yet you have. They have taken bits and pieces from a number of their albums and put them on display in their latest effort. There is a wide variety of music here, but it flows from one song to the next very well. The title cut is a wonderfully arranged work taking full advantage of the vocal talents of both Robin and Barry. Unlike some of their previous works, the production retooling doesn't seem overdone here. Other favorites are Wedding Day (sure to be a wedding anthem), Man in the Middle (Mo's look at his relationship with his brothers)and Sacred Trust. After forty years in the business, the Gibbs prove that they're still able to write songs that can connect with a number of generations."
5,The Brothers Gibb at Their Best!,"As a Bee Gee fan since 1967, when ""New York Mining Disaster"" totally knocked me out, I have to say that, 34 years later, the Brothers Gibb are still making beautiful, unique music. This album, starting with the irresistable title track, marks a return to the 60s and 70s, when they made their best music- strong melodies, flawless harmonies, first-class production, etc., but with a modern sound. It includes one haunting classic, ""Wedding Day,"" as well as outstanding pop songs such as ""Embrace,"" Deja Vu,"" (both would be hit singles if released under another group's name), ""Sacred Trust,"" and ""Walking On Air."" Only one cut, ""Voice in the Wilderness,"" is a disappointment. If you're looking for a CD with 11 great songs by a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriter's Hall of Fame group(in the history of rock, only the Beatles' songs have sold more than theirs), this record's for you."
2,a bee gees' classic,"finally, the bee gees have come back to the music universe. ""this is where i came in"", their new album is more simple than ""still water"". their first single, ""this is where i came in"", is a good number. robin sang it well (i love robin's voice). of course, barry and maurice also have a good action in that song. umm, this album is quite different than ""still water"". there are so many music variation. more rock'n'roll (she keeps on coming)! and ""wedding day"" is a very beautiful number. robin also sang two solo numbers and so is maurice. more variations!"
1,This is where I came in,I have not received this item that I ordered. What's the holdup? I'll be glad to revue it when I receive it.
2,WHAT HAPPENED?,"THIS IS AN OK ALBUM IF YOURE 50YRS OLD ,MALE AND HAVE A MOTORCYCLE.I AM NOT! IT MAKES YOU WISH YOU HAD A BUTTON ON YOUR CD PLAYER TO CHANGE VOCALS And melodies etc, especially the twee wedding day! i like just in case though, as premiered on keppel road."
1,"A steaming pile of dog squeeze, it is.","Like another reviewer, I feel badly burned on this ""update"". While Garageband has a few nice upgrades, iPhoto has completely destroyed my photo library. Attempts to re-install the older program fail, as the new one seems uninstallable. Apple's help forum is virtually unmanned, except for one regular who has expansive technical knowledge but can't use any of it and gives horrible advice.I have a friend who owns a Mac store, and the vote is unanimous among customers everywhere: this pack of programs is an insultingly useless and expensive steaming pile of dog squeeze. Avoid it at all costs. I've given it one star because 0 isn't an option."
1,Absolute CRAP!,"Apple has morphed into Microsoft.This software is horrible. What happened to Apple? how could they do this to us? Apple used to have a reputation for providing great software. This package will make you tear your hair out.It includes iPhoto. How many people have digital camera's now--everyone. So you need a way to organize your pictures. Fortunately Apple hardware will run Windows, and you will want to, rather than use iPhoto. You won't be able to organize your photos in a logical manner. You won't be able to find your photos. Resizing will be so difficult, where on a Windows machine using Thumbs Plus, it was so easy. I can't say anything good about this software.iMovie is not much better.The bottom line is software should be good, and not drive you crazy in frustration.Don't even consider buying this software."
5,edsaboppin,This product works very well and does everything that Apple said it would do. I am very pleased.
5,Apple does it again,"I have no regrets about purchasing this update from iLife '06. The enhancements to iPhoto alone make the update worth buying. The enhancements to iWeb are also great. Works flawlessly on my iMac G5 with Leopard 10.5. I haven't tried iDVD or iMovie yet, but their day will come. Five stars for sure."
4,Worth 3 times what I paid,"The features in iPhoto and iWeb are worth the money alone. I haven't started using iDVD or Garage Band yet, but I'm sure they will be as great as the rest of the package. I now wish I had bought a new iMac so I could use iMovie 8. Final Cut Express will continue to work just fine for me. BTW I use a Power Mac 1.25 DP with Leopard (see my review, Awesome) and all programs work flawlessly."
1,They should have a zero stars option,"Let's say little Joey catches his first baseball. Want to slow it down. Sorry. A bunch of kids at a party running around and want to speed it up? You can't. Want to change a transition? Can't. Want to use some plug ins. Nope. Do not buy this software if you use iMovie. I should have read the reviews. The reason you can make a movie so fast is because there aren't those annoying features that get in the way. You can download iMovie 06 for free though! While you're at it go ahead and download OS 8, it's free as well."
2,iLife 08 recommend with a caveat,I bought this product mainly for iPhoto application and at this stage a little disappointed that the book creation aspect does not contain all of the former templates. This necessitated that I back up the old iPhoto application and old iPhoto library on a external hard drive. Hopefully apple will correct this with an update. Thus I am not completely happy. The other aspects of iPhoto are interesting and I am having fun exploring them i.e.new editing features etc.
2,disappointing,"I just bought an HD video camera and while iLife 6 could handle the editing, when transferring the edited video to iDVD (SD quality), the audio was missing in part or the tracks superimposed. Also, there was no way to transfer the edited HD video back to the camera. I bought iLife 08 and was very disappointed by the disappearance of so many features of iMovie 6, especially the missing chapter marks, the much more limited titling features and transitions. Other than that the bug in the audio has been fixed, there is no reason to get iLife 08, since you lose so many features. And it is still not possible to transfer the edited HD video back to the camera. Apparently Apple wants the customer, who needs the features of iMovie 6 and full HD coverage, to buy Final Cut Express."
2,inproper labeling,"I love my new Apple iMAC computer but the new computers and iLIFE do not come with iDVD. I went and bought this version of iLife because it did not state that it would not be compatable with my new iMAC. Well it was not compatable and I lost out by spending money for this version of iLife. I think that the seller should have listed what this version of iLife is compatable, or incompatable with."
5,Great!,Received the order fast and it works on snow leppord! Installed on my MacBook pro in a matter of minutes. Packaging was like new. iLife '08 rocks and is faster than the new version.
4,Apple iLife-08,"Product had all the features that I needed to reinstall a standard feature I had dropped to save space. (I wished it had also had Apple ""Mail"", but that wasn't the immediate task at hand.)"
1,iPhoto is a living nightmare in iLife 08... Save yourself and DO NOT INSTALL!,"I purchaed the software after reading all of the wonderful improvements to iLife 06 -- I expected iPhoto to be better organized, lightning fast, and have the ability to store more images. NOT TRUE. It is slow as a snail (and I have 2GB of RAM!), you cannot toggle between editing screens like before and the images I attach to emails now come in bitmap instead of jpg format -so nobody can do anything with them!I was also looking forward to the iWeb upgrades and so far, so good, but Apple promised the capability to use one's own domain name without mask forwarding and so far, I cannot figure out how to accomplish this.From what I've read iMovie is a disaster as well, although I haven't tried it. My plan is to empty my iPhoto library and uninstall iLife 08 asap. I much prefer iLife 06 for it's ease of use. Hope this helps someone..wish I would have known!"
2,disappointing,"iWeb has lost functionality so I didn't install it. So iPhoto is the only application I use. What was film rolls from iPhoto 6 is now events, so this is better.I set slideshow settings (time and music) and click on save settings button but it randomly reverts back to default settings. Random event is selected when I start iPhoto up, so I need to scroll for a while to get to latest event. New iPhoto library being a package makes it more time consuming to back up, I can't just back up 2007 photos. Still no way to write IPTC info to pictures, so I don't use iPhoto comments. Last 12 months do not seem to work correctly.Disappointing."
1,WAIT!,"Seriously do your homework before upgrading to this!!! I did and the massive negative response for iMovie, iWeb, iPhoto are more than enough for you to STAY WHERE YOU ARE! Don't upgrade. Come on Apple!~ Where is the customer service and loyalty??? Very disappointing! VERY! Like a bad child!!! Bad bad bad boy!!! I will just hold out and hope you correct yourself!!!"
3,Release Cycles and System Requirement fine print,"While I did manage to get the better picture slide show encoding option I was looking for with the newer version of iDVD, it wish I had read the system requirements more closely to have known that the 08 iMovie would not install on my G4 Mac prior to purchasing this software package. That is my fault. I was a bit annoyed, but not too surprised, that Apple released iLife 09 1 month later. Since I'm still running 10.4 even the new iPhoto with face recognition would not run on my system without upgrading to 10.5, so I'll continue to appreciate the iLife 08 sw packages which do run on my setup and make sure I read the fine print before purchasing in the future."
3,iMovie 08 Was a Bummer - Everything Else Was Great,"As long as you don't buy this for iMovie 08, then this is a great product. iMovie 08 is a HORRIBLE replacement for the incredibly easy to use and powerful older iMovie. iMovie 08 may have a place in this world under a different name and as a differently focused product, but it is NOT a good movie editor."
2,Just ok,"I was happy with some improvements on the iPHOTO, but very disappointed with the iMOVIE and iDVD...I havent been able to edit anything, too complicated or probably just doesnt work properly....I kept the 07 version on my other MAC so i edit my movies there."
2,"Worst ""upgrade"" ever.","It's not just that iMovie has been completely ruined. It's also that none of the things that were missing from the last iLife have been improved, or have been made worse.iPhoto still doesn't understand standard metadata in IPTC or XMP formats, so all your categories and captions get lost as soon as you export, and if you have captioned photos the information is lost when you add them to iPhoto.iTunes has gained a new lockout to prevent other software from accessing your iTunes music library, and to prevent use of iPods on Linux.iWeb still can't produce something as simple as a page with an HTML heading and some paragraphs; everything is meaningless DIV elements.GarageBand still lacks a basic sample editor. I guess it's OK if you like presets."
2,The movie components have been ruined,"iPhoto, Garage Band and iWeb are great. IPhoto in particular is really much better than its predecessor, especially in terms of speed.iDVD and iMovie are disastrous pieces of software. iMovie no longer supports chapters. iDVD for me has been extremely unreliable and meant dozens of hours spent on forums finding out things like don't use music in the intros in certain 7.0 themes or your computer will lock up on encoding the DVD menus.Apple had a halo for me. Now I just think they're another cynical software shop."
4,Balancing updates versus radical changes,"Several of the items have valuable changes, but the change to iMovie should have been handled better by Apple. The need for an Intel processor for iMovie is burdensome, but at least it doesn't wipe out iMovieHD on install."
4,Getting Old Computers Up-To-Speed,"The iLife 08 box arrived incredibly fast, but my poor G4 PowerBook works so hard to make it worthwhile. I can't use the iMovie update, and iWeb and especially iDVD push the G4 into running quite slowly. But they produce the results I really needed, and the installation went like clockwork. The demo of iWork that came with it finally convinced me to change back to the Apple office utilities package, which I had left for Office 2004 (which was given to me for free)."
3,Three Legendary Tenors,"The singing is great, the historical data is enlightening, butthere is just too much talking. Only one or two arias are sung completely. I would much rather hear exerpts from various operas where these three tenors performed. I would give this DVD a new name. Three Legendary Tenors, Lite."
5,Great Toy,My son loves these magnetic blocks and since he is a big fan of knights this set is perfect!
1,where's techno on here???,"If I could give this cd 0 stars, I would. Just by looking at the artists on this compilation and then looking at the title of the CD tells you how much ""The Happy Boys"" (whoever they are) know about electronic music. Most of the tracks on here are House, Trance, and little elements of Progressive House. If you wanna listen to techno, listen to WestBam. Now they are writing music that really is techno. And trust me, there are other compilations out there that are way better and are mixed properly. DON'T SUPPORT ""THE HAPPY BOYS""."
4,Original short SF novel,"When Easter Eggs that ring when touched fall from the sky, it's both a new kind of First Contact and a love story. The question is--what kind of love?An original science fiction novel from the author of SPARROWHAWK."
2,Just a so-so pedal,"This pedal really didn't WOW me. I have several others and found that this item was the weakest of the bunch and therefore returned it to the retailer. Granted, the pedal wasn't expensive, but I saw no reason to keep it."
5,Great Basic Distortion Pedal,"I love the fact that there are only 2 knobs on this pedal; Very simple and adds just the right sting to your sound. I was surprised how smooth and clear the effect was, while still packing a nice punch. A great pedal to use as a lead booster, too. It doesn't really imitate Yngwie's sound/tone, but out of all the pedals I have tried over the years, this is the one I am happiest with regarding lead tones. You can do alot with those 2 knobs, and at the price you can't lose. Solid pedal, too; Will hold up to even the heaviest foot stomping......"
4,Best $30 I ever spent on a pedal.,"This pedal is a simple signal booster. It does exactly what I expect it to do and it's the best $30 I ever spent on a pedal. I personally would not describe this as an ""overdrive"" pedal (though by technical definition it is) in the sense that is nothing like a tube screamer. If you're looking for an overdrive, distortion, or fuzz pedal, this probably isn't what you want. The way I use this pedal is to add sustain, and enhance pick dynamics by running it into an amp that's already a little distorted. Sounds great.."
4,"Nice little pedal, but..","For some reason when I put this pedal in my chain it muddies up my tone, even when it's turned off.When I first got it, it had a very nice tone. The drive wasn't overly powerful and didn't ruin the tone. One of only problems with it was the lack of an LED or something similar to show that it was turned on.As for my muddiness issue, I think I may be having power or (guitar) wiring issues that are causing my problems but I have no way of determining that at the moment, so I had to dock it 1 star, just in case.For the price I think it's definitely worth checking out, worst case scenario you return it and best case you love it!"
1,Extremely Excited and Sorely Disappointed...,"I ordered this product with the anticipation of seeing some of the Giants Of Jazz in their element...producing soul stirring, thought provoking, foot stomping music.What I found is that this particular DVD would not play in any of my players...what a let down. And from what I could tell, this was the only one of its kind listed on the site.Would love to find this DVD again and give it another shoot! I can tell you that the music on this DVD was going to be great...and to see the players in person would have been that much more exciting.So...bad product...NOT bad music!"
5,Great Ska CD,"Big D and the Kids Table is one of the best ska bands out there right now. They are not the typical 3rd wave ""pop ska"" that became popular in the mid-nineties (Bosstones, RBF, etc.). They incorporate an appreciation for punk rock in their music which is rare in this genre of music. This CD is pure punk/ska from beginning to end (it is a bit lengthy at 20 tracks, but there are no filler tracks here). The only band that is still around that is similar to these guys is Catch 22. My favorite tracks are: ""LAX,"" ""Flashlight,"" ""Cutshow,"" and ""Little Bitch"" (which is one of the best cover songs i have ever heard (originally by the legendary Specials which you should familiarize yourself with if you haven't already)). Give this band your support and buy their CDs (they were homeless for a couple years recently due to traveling costs and paying their label). They are seriously one of the best ska bands out there right now."
2,Terrible,"A friend of mine inrtroduced me to this band with the claim they were the greatest of all time, with this being their best. Well, this might be their best, but it sucks none the less. The first song comes right at you, rocking, heavy, an excellent song. Lyrically its moronic, but then again, it fits with the mood of the other songs. The, the album goes down hill. From that first great track (2 if you count the intro) the next however many songs just plain suck. It doesnt break any new ground soundwise, only bores you. Ok, it has horns, its ska. Ska was great in 6th grade. After that, all you fans of ska, you have a duty to realize how utterly boring and stupid ska-punk is. Groups that don't evolve die. Genres that don't evolve die (Punk anyone?) So yes, no matter how fast they play the music, this is ordinary, and boring ska fit for no one outside of die hard ska fans. And they suck anyways."
5,A passionate & thought provoking plea to Christians to pray,"I have always prayed a lot. I have studied the subject in the scriptures. But as I opened and read the pages of ""E.M. Bounds on Prayer"", I felt as if I hardly knew prayer and therefore my Father God. I had so limited God in my prayer life. Edward Bounds shows from the scriptures the importance of prayer, the power of prayer and God's desire for prayer. Prayer is how we talk to God. Mr. Bounds shows examples from the Bible how God responds to real, passionate, persistent prayer. The words of Christ were, ""Men ought to pray and not to faint"". E.M. Bounds echo's the words of our Lord and Savior and shows the hearts desire of a Father wanting to bless his children. His children though must talk to the Father. That is prayer. If you read this book and believe the scriptures quoted within it's pages, you will pray more and your prayers will get answers. God promises it!"
3,a vv heavy read...,The Pencil is jam packed with technical and historical development of the humble pencil.... which is good and reflects extremely good research... however it is not a light read.... that's why i'm giving it 3 stars.... i was practically dragging myself to read the book.... it became a daunting task... i'll give it another go sometime... overall... its an ok book.... i'd recommend borrowing it or purchasing it at a bargain price....
2,actually kind of dull,Despite my background as an engineer I found this book rather dull and tough to finish. There are some things that I guess I didn't need to know about pencils.
3,Interesting History,"If you are an engineer, you will enjoy this book. It is drawn out in some parts, but gives a great relationship to engineering and the design of the pencil. A must for mechanical or civil engineering students or professionals."
3,Too narrow,"I have always loved moccosins, but these are way too narrow for wide feet.. nice shoes but can't wear so they stay in closet. If you have wide feet don't order."
5,Finally!!!!! The Answer To My Hair's Prayers!!!!!,"Finally! Something that actually takes my naturally poofy (well techinically curly- but not on it's own) and makes it curly!!!!! I have spent so much money on every curl enhancer product I could find, and nothing really worked on my thick poofy hair! You have to experiment with the amount that works for you. Too much of it and it will create crunch. It's a pump, but you can not push it down all the way to get 1/4 or 1/2 a pump amount. It also must be applied to wet hair. I do it before the towel. I highly recommend trying this product, and experimenting with the application and method if it doesn't work the first time. I personally hope Tigi Catwalk NEVER changes the formula, or worse... discontinue it!!!"
2,Didn't really like it,"Sometimes you just can't put a book down. You have to finish it. And when you do, you wished it didn't end so soon. Well Terror Firm from Matthew Thomas isn't one of those books. It's not exactly boring but it isn't interesting either. If I had brought another book with me on the plane I am not even sure I would have finished it. The book is all about conspiracy theories and how they are all true. In fact it is the aliens that feed the humans with paranoia because that's the state of mind they want us in. Of course they want to enslave us. Luckily for us the most paranoid of all the people have found them out and will try to save us all. Sound good? Well the book wasn't. And that's what really matters."
5,Great reference,"It is a good review of workbenches with lots of information to digest. Don't buy this if you are only looking for plans but it is great for getting ideas on what you want to do for your workbench, or modifications you may want to add to the one you already have."
4,Fairly good -- narrow focus,"This book is well written but it doesn't cover all aspects of wood workbench design and construction. It covers a simplified design that allows for a ""traditional-looking"" bench with a pattern of 3/4"" holes over the top and front apron for anchoring work to the bench. I was hoping for coverage of the construction of a traditional european wood workbench using classic joinery and hardware. Unfortunately, it was not the case."
3,Only 20% of the book is devoted to building workbenches,"Book is OK. Only About two chapters, 20% of it deals with making workbenches. The rest is about how to use the bench, how to buy and use tools. Probably not worth the money"
1,don't buy this-not encoded for usa,"I put this information on before. Not encoded for USA DVD players. Company (Music Media) said they would replace with ""correct"" encoding, this still has not occured. Note that only now proper encoding info is being listed on purchase info page. Is Amazon is turning into eBay? (Now into the 5/6th week with no resolution-31may05)"
3,"Good Item, Incomplete Pack","The item is good for the value. Nevertheless, the package came with only 24 discs instead of the advertised 25."
4,Good,I purchased these for a youth soccer league. Shipment was fast and the quality is good. Would buy more if I needed them.
3,OK - but Small size,"Wanted the ""large"" (11"" diameter, or 4""high) disc cones for soccer practice (they stay in place better). These are the small (8"" diameter) cones and they are a fine product...just wished the description included size.When using the cones they flip when a ball rolls over them. By the time practice is over 1/2 the cones are inverted but close to the same place they started."
3,Not what is shown in picture,"I ordered a few cones for my soccer team. The red ones show the grooves at the top and I specifically wanted them. My plan was to buy some PVC pipe, cut it down to 18 inch and use the poles with the cones as hurdles. I purchased some taller cones and wanted these red ones so the girls can have different heights. These do not have the grooves and I already have enough basic cones."
2,Aweful,this soundtrack is one of the worst out there. is lacks any substantial composittion including originality of sound or anything similar. I would not recommend it!
4,10-part series on two DVDs,"I am not a self-appointed authority on the topic, so please don't expect an in-depth review from me :-)Each episode runs for about 25 minutes including the opening/closing credits.The 10 parts are:1) Precursors2) Surrealists3) War photography4) Portraitists5) Photoreporters6) Fashion photography7) Nudes8) Photography & Science9) Amateur Photography10)Photographic marketIt touches upon the majority of the topics and issues of photography, and includes (a younger) Herb Ritz as a guest commentator among others. Some people may find its style, dvd menu design, or music a bit quirky or off(beat). I found the content quite interesting overall, given how rare it is to find serialized documentaries on photography. The only other one I recall is ""The Language of Photography"" that aired/airs on some PBS stations."
3,Neither Great Nor Terrible,"This 4 hour DVD tackles a difficult subject matter - the apostles of Jesus. The subject is difficult because we have so little information about the apostles. As a result, the author presents a lot of conjecture and unfortunately conjecture was occasionally presented as fact. Nevertheless, the DVD does make for a useful overview of the 12 (and Mary Magdalene) along with interesting details gleaned from the Bible, information regarding the time and places of their lives, as well as traditions that have flowed down to us through the centuries."
1,Not written by believers...,"I got as far as the first episode about Peter where they describe Peter as a man who was partly real, partly fiction.This is a pseudo-academic, pseudo-religious farce created from an unbelieving viewpoint. It doesn't harm my faith, but I'm not going to waste my time on half-truths posing as authority. The ""story"" as it is entitled, is not wholly in accord with the Biblical account of Peter. I don't need some unbeliever holding my hand and deciding for me what is real."
5,Another good addtion to my library,"If you are wondering as to what happened to the Apostles after Jesus left them, this is a good and informative book."
2,Not as pictured,"the tubes did not come as advertised, same color as pictured, but the caps were not attached and were not easy to open quickly at all."
2,Not quite so good for upland game in SoCal,"Good for water training (floats well) and perhaps grassy areas, but I've used this a bit in upland game areas where there are more trees, bushes and rocks/decomposed granite than grass, and nonetheless it frayed pretty badly after a few weeks. Biothane type checkcords are much more durable and easier to clean than this one (I don't even use it anymore). Also gets very dirty fast and does not clean well. Would only recommend for water training... plus the whole bowline knot setup is awkward and was a pain for my dog... literally 4 inches of hanging knot around her neck made for a weak experience for us."
1,Case blocks GPS signals on the HP iPaq rx 5915,"The armor case does protect the rx 5915 and has a clip that lets you put the device on your belt. But the metal case also blocks the GPS signal. So if you intend to use the GPS functions of the rx5915, you'll have to take it out of the case. I think there are non-GPS versions of the iPaq rx5915--this was probably intended for them."
4,sweet story,"I thought this was a sweet story. Vic, and Claire started out as friends, and one night that friendship grew into something hot, and steamy. They made a baby together. The book is about how they handle it together. Vic wants to be right by her side. Claire wants to be independent. She does not want to me married just because she is pregnant. Vic has to work to win her over. Mean while he has to work on his own heart too, and put his past in the past. He was married before and his marriage was torn apart when his daughter Emma died. That part of the story tugs at my heart. As a parent I can't imagine what any parent faces who has to deal with the loss of their child. But with love all things are possible. His love for Claire lets him dream of a new beginning!Sample from chapter twoVic's steady friendship had meant a lot to her. How could she not turn to him? Comfort that night had shifted quickly to something more. She nuzzled his neck. ""mmm. You smell so good."""
1,Don't buy this!!!,"I was very excited when I first discovered I could get the dance pad for my TV! Unfortunately this excitment didn't last too long. Pretty much died after hearing the first song, not to mention all the ""songs"" sound the same. The dance pad itself is a piece of crap as well. Doesn't register your steps half the time & quit working after half an hour :( And if all this is not enough to deter you, Amazon sent this to me through MyGear.com & they are not being cooperative about a refund."
1,Don't Waste your Time,"This is the worst possible item you cold buy. The thing doesn't even work half the time and when it does, it does not respond. The compnay that ships this should pull this 8 bit crap off their market and give people a quality product, when they pay for. I would have given this product 0 stars but it wouldn't let meAngry in Minnesota"
1,less than 1 star,"crap worst thing around do not buy not even for a penny, songs are dumb, shipping is crazy, not even good enough for a preschooler,"
3,A little disappointed,"My son LOVES this game, however the music is a bit cheesy, and the graphics can make you sick looking at them for too long. We have bought this twice and have had no problems other than the prongs for the cord have broken off both times."
1,ok i guess,This shipping was VERY fast. Very happy with shipping. Felt as if i got the item next day. All pieces were in the box. graphics were just as other posters described. It says 50 songs but a good 1/3 of the songs just has a picture of a CD. I have no idea what that is about. Most of the songs sound pretty much the same.
3,Unexpected.,I expected this game to be MUCH more similar to the real DDR. It looks like something from NES or Atari.
2,ok but nothing spectacular,The company who sent it was very quick but I most admit the graphics and sound were even a little worse than I expected-- and I had low expectations. It was really like atari. Remember those days?
5,5 star,My son's girlfriend is going to have fun using these with the Paintball gun we he got her for Christmas.
2,you get what you pay for,"cheap!! We received purple balls, not the ones shown, and they are egg shaped. :("
3,late shipment,"was not received with original order, thought would come next day or 2, had to contact sender before they were sent"
3,okay but not so great painballs,one bag was good but the other bag every single paintball had a huge flatspot.
3,Good comphrensive look at music...but,"They did a pretty decent job. Some problems crop up, however, as there are errors throughout the book on specific bands that even the casual fan would catch. Hey, I'm not a fan of all these bands, but I caught most of the errors. There are also proof reading errors throughout the book.These points aside, most of the reviews are fairly well written and informed. Whether or not you agree with the opinions expressed, the authors generally have solid reasoning for their comments. Still, one could wish for better accuracy for a book that is supposedly so comphrensive.Hey guys, if you're looking for an additional writer I'm available!"
2,Not current enough!,"Even though this is the 1997 3rd edition, there were few reviews for music after 1994. There were few listings for bands that began after 1994. I returned the book. Very dissappointing!"
5,Incra LS17WFNCSYS,With practice/trial and error you can achieve excellent results. The product is extremely accurate and allows for precise adjustments for routing projects.
3,Several Days in the Life of,"Several Days in the Life of a surgeon. His anxieties, dilemmas, confidence levels and opinions of what happens in the ICU of a hospital. I think that this book might be best suited for other doctors to co-experience the thought processes of a fellow surgeon and not feel alone in their own mental traumas."
4,Don't drive here without it!,"Beyond the usual travelers' tips, Jeanne Mozier takes the reader along the folk by-ways of this mountain secret-state. West Virginia's population isn't huge, so each oddity merits special attention, and well-deservedly. But as one of The Mountain State's native writers once said, ""If you flattened it out, it'd be bigger than Texas."" Discover more than ramps and pepperoni rolls in the steeply-crenellated hills and hollows of a charming and picturesque place where individuals are treasured, even staunchly defended."
4,Mindblowing...,"Surely one of the best albums of the decade,'Mindfields'is not simply a return to form for Toto,but rather a whole new level.They cover every style with amazing versatility:rock'n'roll,blues,trademark ballads,while the songs are long enough to display incredible musicianship on their part and thoroughly satisfy the listener.A great new album..."
3,Le retour de Bobby Kimball,"Suite à la tournée "" TOTO XX "" , le groupe retourne dans les studios et fort de la voix originelle et familière de Bobby Kimball , compose leur nouvel album.L'album est assez inégal. Mais des titres proches de l'me Toto sortent du lot : "" Caught in The balance "" et "" Mad About you "".Elliot Scheiner co-produit ce nouvel opus.Best : Caught in The balance , Mad About you, Better World, Cruel.Plus d'info sur : www.totofrance.com"
2,Not up to potential...,"Released: Mar 1999 Produced by: TotoMuch-heralded (abroad, anyway) return of Bobby Kimball falls short of expectations. While he's in fine form (as are all musicians, as usual), suffers from ""CD Syndrome"": too many tracks and overlong tunes (some work, e.g. neo-prog ""Better Days,"" others, like ""High Price Of Hate"" simply drone). Spotted with gems (""Melanie"" could be Steve Lukather's finest ballad, ""Mad About You"" is effective sing able pop, ""Cruel"" is first rate Toto pop R&B;, and title track riff is almost impossible not to hum along with); virtually ballad-free, but filler abounds. David Paich lead vocal meter: bonus track only, and it's a dog. Focus would return on next album. Aficionados only."
2,boring,"To me, all these songs sound the same. I hear one rock song with Bobby Kimball singing, who really does not have the most melodic of voices- and I want to skip to the next track. But on this collection, all the songs with him singing lead sound exactly the same to me, with the possible exception of 'mindfields'. Steve's lead vocal tracks are a mixed bag, but better than Kimball's. 'Melanie' is a melodic ballad that is really refreshing after the rockier tuneless stuff on here. I also like 'After you've gone' and 'Better world' is also a strong effort.My favourite track is not even my edition of the album, and I had to download it. 'Spanish steps' is sung by David and is a totally different style to the rest of the album. It sounds like some melodic song by the Alan Parsons Project and is way better than anything else on here!"
2,disappointing,"This backpack looks good on screen, but the reality is disappointing.For what it holds, it is bulky. There is an adjustable contraption on the back, but I can't see what it does, except take up space. The zippers catch if you are not careful. Personally, I don't find the color appealing, but someone else may like it.Size-wise, it seems just about right for a 15"" screen. I think 15.4"" would be tight.Still, the price is reasonable, and it is by no means shoddy. If you like extra padding on the back and shoulders and don't need too much carrying space, you may find it ideal."
2,ummm...,"i was disappointed in this video. if you're expecting instruction on technique or any tips...forget it. this is more of a glam vid for stanley to just say why he's so good.stanley, i know you're good. i've seen you play live 3 or 4 times. you should give some instruction in your instructional video."
3,Hardboiled Private Eye,"I liked Truluck's voice, and the book had moments for me that were enjoyable, but I wouldn't read another book by this author. It's more suited to someone who likes the hardboiled genre, the old Maltese Falcon style, set in the here and now. The main character is believable and sarcastically humorous, if you enjoy that. I did."
2,To Much Slang,Overall the book was decent but the constant use of slang in the book didn't create an authentic atmosphere but only served to slow me down as i was reading. If this book was the best private eye novel in 1999 I would hate to see how awful the others had to be.
2,Simply too profane for my taste,"I selected the book based on it's listing among the best first mysteries in several of the mystery awards. And while I give it two stars for hints of underlying promise, I gave up after 70 pages. I only give up on about 2% of the books I start so there has to be something pretty wrong (for me - 40 something female avid reader). In this case, it's profanity. Now I've been know to drop a juicy four letter word once in awhile. However, I started to be annoyed with the constant profanity in this book early on. Then I started looking for a page with a profanity - and I couldn't find one in the next twenty pages that I read. Bottom line -- the profanity so distracted me from the plot that I simply could not get into the book."
4,Die Fledermaus,"I would have given 5 stars except that this copy was not the same production as the VSH tape of the same title and cast that I have. It never occurred to me that the productions would be different and I was disappointed. However, the DVD is excellent and certainly worth 5 stars if you've never seen the VHS production."
5,Delightful,We've already watched this three times since we received it. We love it! The vocals are outstanding and the acting is superb. The staging and props are very impressive. Not in any way were we the least bit disappointed.
2,A Disappointing Fledermaus,"I have to compare this version to the Carlos Kleiber version and what is most striking is the musicality and ensemble playing plus pure energy visible on the stage of the Kleiber version. This version is a routine version adapted to an English audience and I find it prosaic at best with the added Act 2 guest appearances which I found annoying. While I agree with an earlier reviewer that Herman Prey's Eisenstein is well sung, the sheer energy and joy that the Eisenstein of Eberhard Waechter conveys makes Prey's Eisenstein seem pallid. Janet Perry and Pamela Coburn in the female leads bring both outstanding singing and energy to this production that is not present in this Convent Garden Version. I really recommend the Kleiber version, not because this version is so terrible, but because the Kleiber version is so integrated and musical that it brings the pure pleasure of Fledermaus to the viewer and listener."
5,"Vivo Domingo! Bravo Jailer, et omnia!","As with everything with Placido Domingo's touch, this performance is superlative. Far from being distracting the language French, German, Italian, and English, and opera humor is hilarious. Josef Meinrad, as jailer Frosch, is worth the purchase alone. Guest appearance by Dame Hilda Bracket with Dr. Evadne Hinge was charming, and ballet duo Merle Park and Wayne Eagling absolutely lovely. All of which embellish a consistently excellent cast. Especially enjoyable were Hildegard Heichele's Adele, and Dennis O'Neill the tenor who wouldn't stop singing. The only disappointment was lack of spunk in Rosalinde's Hungarian song, which should be the showpiece of the operetta. You'll like it, especially if you're multi-lingual."
5,Pathfinder of Effective Writing!,"I'm really fired up! Painless Writing does help us get rid of turgid and stilted way of writing, that's for sure. This must save us a lot of waste which annoys readers. I noticed that shorter and more concise sentences come before longer and wordier ones. I haven't finished reading it yet, though. Especially, too many prepositions and passive voices get on my nerves and dilute my enthusiasm for reading. For example, what if your boy/girlfriend said,""You are loved by me.""? How lame! I would be embarrassed and run away! Do you know why? - It sounds too formal to suit the situation. In short, it's an automatic turn-off! From this example, I'm sure you will put plainness before wordiness.Overall, I bet you can say good-bye to the repetition of wordiness!"
5,Inovation of the highest caliber,"Radiohead is a band with a long history that covers many of the different ""genres"" and styles that have recently been prominant in todays western pop music. If you consider the drastic evolution from their earliest albums to the most recent, it is easy to see that creativity, change, and innovation have always been at the forefront of thier creative spark. Indeed these are key elements in any creative feild and the product that these key elements yeilds is one of immense artistic integrity. This newest album is certainly not an exception. Radiohead reamins to me one of the greatest bands of our time."
4,It's alright,"I must say I enjoy this album quite a bit more than Kid A. It can't compare with OK Computer (or even the bends for that matter) but it's better than most of the pop that other bands are pumping out. In general each track has more of a ""song"" feel to it--that is, each song is its own entity. Some are really well done (pyramid song, i might be wrong, knives out, etc.) while others aren't. There's one track that sounds like a rip off of massive attack, at least to me. Whether or not it is, it sounds bad.Radiohead said that they didn't want to make another OK computer. I hope they've had their fun and have now changed their minds. But for some reason I doubt it, and I think Radiohead are only going to increase in their strangeness until even the artsy music snobs don't like them."
2,Meandering shmehy bleh,"OK Computer is one of the best albums ever. What happened? This is no longer a rock and roll band, they've become an experiment in inovative electronic sounds, whiny vocals and a smattering of boring guitar work. Over time, see how many times you actually listen to this disc."
3,The Universal Radiohead-Music Industry Conspiracy!,"Other People have said the Thom and the guys wouldn't have got away with this album if it weren't for 'The Bends' and 'OK Computer'. I agree. It's simply not possible for debut bands to release music that is this adventurous.Radiohead have established such a happy relationship with fans and the media that they can release anything, call it art, and succeed.Having said that, people wouldn't belive it if it weren't partially true. Thus 'Amnesiac' is a good album.If it weren't for bands like Radiohead and Primal Scream, who relentlessly push the boundaries, the music industry would become stuck in a rut, stuck in a rut, stuck in a rut. And it just so happens that the mystique that surrounds every Radiohead release enables them to be more pioneering. It's all good..."
4,get it,walking down the box set isle and see this limited version of the new radiohead cd. not only was the cover and art awesome the cd blew me away. #1's and #3 are my personal favorites from the cd. i like what they did with the whole project and highly recommend this cd. and get it quick because this special edition is supposedly very limited. i wasnt into kid a when i first got it. actually it wasnt until i hear amnesiac that i listened to the entire kid a cd. which i cant get enough of now. i think idioteque on that cd is brilliant. read all the stories about radiohead songs here. http://www.greenplastic.com/lyrics/index.html ..... Enjoy !
5,Music on another level....,"I think that Radiohead deserve praise for continuously pushing musical boundaries. Personally, I have seen my musical taste develop as a result of following the band's development. I believe that if you are standing still it equivalent to going backwards. Radiohead always seems to be moving forward with their musical ambitions and that is good for music."
4,Not Kid B,"Although made at the same place as Kid A, Radiohead's Amnesiac is different than Kid A. It deserves to be seperate in it's own right. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, many tracks on this CD are spectuacular, displaying more of Radiohead's singing talent than Kid A. ""I Might Be Wrong"" has a magnificent guitar riff. Hunting bears is an eerie guitar solo, and although some might say it's filler (blasphemers!), I think it's a hauntingly wonderful track that reminds me of the music from ""Deliverance"". Although ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors"" and ""Like Spinning Plates"" may be a bit obnoxious, it does not impede the overall quality of this cd."
5,My thirst has finally been quinched!,"Those of you who have only been exposed to ""Creep"" playing over and over on the radio(yes, it is a great song), you have no idea how far Radiohead has come. Get ""Kid A"" and experience something so emotionally hypnotic that you're left wanting more. Then have ""Amnesiac"" ready, so you're not one of the unfortunate one's like myself, that had to wait. This is a GREAT cd."
3,B-Sides ?,"This album needed to be released to show that Radiohead wasn't resting to prepare ""Kid A.""I do not recommend this CD. It isn't a good enough showcase of an artist's talent.Buy ""The Bends"" or ""OK Computer"" first. Purchase this one only once you've fallen for them."
3,LeT doWn anD HAngiNg AroUnd,"I wanted this album bad, but when I got it I felt like screaming. Radiohead took a differant path with Kid A but now it seems like their lost on that path. Songs just aren't any good. I own every radiohead album and this one is right next to Pablo Honey, in terms of quality."
5,WOW! AMAZINGAMAZINGAMAZING.,"I rarely give ANY product this kind of review - but Amnesiac is one of those rare CD's that can be listened to in entirity. Moody, extremely layered, sad, whistful.Listen to it once and you will be hooked."
5,They only get better,"If Kid A was a jolt to you after the transcendent OK Computer, this one will bring you back. It continues in the experimental vein, but returns to a more song-driven format. Less energetic than OK Computer, more hypnotic, an album that works seamlessly from first cut to last. May even give you a new appreciation of Kid A."
5,HAVE I LOST MY MIND?!-RADIOHEAD KEEPS GETTING BETTER,"Radiohead is back with ""Amnesiac"" and what a feat. This band just keeps getting better and better with each album.Most bands today just wearout after a couple of albums, but Radiohead shows they are one of the most underrated bands today.Well produced artful album with some great cuts like ""Pyramid Song"", ""Hunting Bears"" and ""Dollars & Cents"" to name a few.Each song is a story all its own with its own style, sound, and artful quality.This album is more acoustic than the last and brings the vocals and lyrics out to the forefront.One of the Ten best for 2001."
4,Solid Radiohead With a Few Weak Moments,"IMHO this sounds like Kid A outtakes. Don't get me wrong, there is some great material here but it doesn't have the cohesiveness of Kid A. Some of the songs are as good as, if not better than, the Kid A stuff. Could do without Hunting Bears though, Neil Young did it better on the Dead Man soundtrack...sorry Johnny. Not a big fan of Knives Out either (yawn)...the rest of the world seems to love it though so trust them, it must just be a personal thing."
2,AM I NOT GETTING IT?,"Is it just me or does this CD sound like a garage band banging on the garbage can lids? Don't get me wrong, I thought OK Computer was very unique and one of the few CD's that I never seem to get sick of listening to but I don't get Amnesiac. Maybe I'm just too provincial or not into abstract thought as much as everyone is. I'm not afraid to admit when I don't understand something but a lot of listeners would rather just pretend they do. I guess everyone wants to be pseudo-hip."
2,"Overall, a disappointing effort.","I tried to like this album, I really did. I turned off the phone, locked the doors, sank into my listening room chair, killed all the lights, and let her fly. Now, writing this review after 3 complete listenings to the album over a period of a week, I find myself unsatisfied with the release. I like the ""feel"" of the album; I like the direction Yorke is trying to take it, but it just gets bogged down by the particulars; too long a track here, too underdeveloped a guitar line, or, more predominantly, too much low bass. Not something I enjoyed listening too; it's always a bad sign when I'm eagerly awaiting the NEXT track, hoping it will be something good. The one stand-out track for me is You and Whose Army, which is powerful and beautiful. It reminds me of Exit Music (for a Film) just a bit (my favorite radiohead track ever).. listen to You and Whose Army, in the dark, at high volume, if you've skimmed over it."
1,Great album name - I can't remember why I bought this,"Despite the wrath of Radiohead fans I am sure to endure, I have this funny feeling that the members of the band are laughing at all the critics that called this album ""brilliant."" Yes, I believe this recording is a joke. After listening to Amnesiac, I can't figure out the appeal. Perhaps I just don't get it, maybe I'm not intelligent enough to understand the ""concept album."" I should probably stick to music that displays some sense of feeling and musical ability. Vocals that are sung while half-asleep and songs comprised of one measure repeated over and over and over again are probably too deep for me to understand. To all those that claim to love this album: Amnesiac - the height of pretentiousness."
1,Dreadful,"Terrible. Boring.What a complete disappointment. Bought this CD from the bargain bin and still feel I was ripped off. Sorry, but there is absolutely nothing to say regarding this collection of discomfited sounds and vocal exercises that would be remotely positive. I've said too much already."
2,"good music, sick cow","Don't get me wrong---Radiohead's music isn't that bad, in fact i enjoy pyramid song, but let's face it---the lead singer sounds like a sick, dying cow. i mean, my god! this is depressing. i dunno. maybe i just don't like to sit around and listen to music that makes me want to sulk in the rain and cry myself to sleep. i just would like some variety. in fact, radiohead has destroyed rock and roll. let me put it this way: it's morphine music. it numbs your senses and takes you on a trip into the boohoo section of your brain. if u want a good psychedelic trip, try some Tool or Pink Floyd, not sick, dying cattle."
3,Never Radiohead again!,"If you want to have an aproxiamte idea of Radiohead sound, better go to other material. Amnesiac represents a decline in the evolution of Radiohead art. Perhaps Life in a Glasshouse is the sound that every Raidohead fan expects...but, unfortunatelly, it comes until the very end...after you heard a very unusual and nonsense material. Like a fan of Radiohead, I excpected too much more....this record it's just a case of Amnesiac...."
2,"Sad, Sadder, Saddest","A BIG disappointment! As a Radiohead fan of 7 years, I could harldy bear listening to this unfortunate collection of uninspiring, dull and catastrophic music without an interval. ""Dollars And Cents,"" they say. Easy way of making plenty -- that's what Amnesiac is, really."
3,Find Your Vein,"I don't know if heroin is a prereq for this album, but I don't do it so I listened without. If they are trying to capture what is like to be finding a vein by an old railroad track near dilapidated factory in Liverpool, and rolling around in your own vomit, than I think they succeeded. They still rock though."
2,just do not understand,"the appeal of this man's voice. very whiny to my ears. not getting it. Didn't when it came out, still don't. Radiohead have some great moments but irritating vocalists are really hard to take."
2,Like pondering suicide on a rainy day,"One really good song, ""Like Spinning Plates."" The rest is a bunch of moody wailing to a casio keyboard and a drum machine. Seriously, do these people in here really prefer this sound to the sound of the first two albums? I don't think there is some great evolutionary process at work here, I think they have gotten lazier and each song is starting to sound less unique in comparison with the others."
3,Strange and Beautiful,"If you're looking for conventional and mainstream from Radiohead, you should pack up and leave.Radiohead is beautiful. It's like...cool oprah. Spectacular to listen to, every song is it's own brooding masterpiece, and the true eccentricity of Radiohead art is demonstrated in this album.It is, however, an aquired taste, and needs a couple of spins before it can be fully appreciated for what it is. Listen to ifa) Your love life is like a sad and tragic movieb) Your uphill struggle is getting you down and you say ""meh, i might as well go the whole sorry mile""c) If you can appreciate the strange beauty of Radiohead.Newer listeners might like to try a different album, however, this is packed full of mini- masterpieces...listen to the entire length of every song for maximum enjoyment :)Some beauties include : Pyramid song, Spinning Plates, I Could Be Wrong."
2,What has happened?,"I'm thinking aliens must have abducted Thom York right after OK Computer and did something, becasue this is not the same guy. Message to aliens: Please return the old Thom! I can't take it anymore."
4,Gets better after first two listens,"I had previously said that this was derivative. Now I've gotten to the point that I'm actually used to it.Kid A was one of the best albums of all-time. This, while not as good, can still be enjoyable.It starts out with ""Pact...."", which is a more techno song from the album, as it isn't the best, but good first song. ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Door"" is great, despite the fact that the same chords are being used throughout the song. ""Life In A Glass house"" happens to be my favorite track, a dancy tune that has decent vocals. If you're not already interested, get The Bends, OK Computer, or Kid A. This isn't their best, but I like it."
4,Perfect memento!,"They can't help it. Radiohead is a brand name and their website an award-winning marketing tool. And Amnesiac is quite an experience - if I haven't forgotten (just kiddin'). Beautiful and impressive, it touches the heart as well as the mind. And the spirit. Unlike Coldplay and Travis this Radiohead does want to cause Trouble and do more than just Sing, Sing, Sing. And I like that, I like Radiohead for being anti-Blair, and even more so for being against major corporations and dollars and cents in general. Indeed they are. Just as long as the heart matters too (Pyramid Song) I can dig a little piece of Autechre (like in Pulk/Pull). I think of Amnesiac as the bridge between OK Computer and Kid A. Most songs on Amnesiac could well have been written and/or recorded before most songs on their predecessor. Perfect memento - when most bands just want to shut up and dance, this Amnesiac."
2,Lost Respect for Radiohead,"This album sounds like it's comprised of a few mediocre new tunes penned up in a jiffy and then all the leftover junk from the Kid A sessions. Really uncool (and lazy) of this otherwise talented band to put out an uncohesive collection of leftovers in the guise of an LP. Even and EP would've been acceptable. OK Computer was creative and brilliant and Kid A, at least sonically, continued to break new ground for the band, but the bulk of this album is just rubbish. The Morning Bell reworking is just awful. People giving this album 5 stars must be tone-deaf and easily swayed by hype, cool covers and packaging."
4,In a word: Interesting,"For all the criticism this album has gotten, they are right on a couple of things: 1. It's not the best stuff radiohead has put out and therefore 2. It's nowhere near as good as OK Computer. That said, this is still good music and not exactly a step backwards for Radiohead, more of a sidestep. The cd starts off with a brilliant piece of percussion and bass, ""Packd Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box"". From then on you really have to listen to the album a few times to fully enjoy each song. This is not a cd you can skip around on. On a whole however, this album is worth your time and money."
3,A blemish on an otherwise perfect record,"I love Radiohead. If anyone asks me for my favorite band, I don't hesitate to scream out ""Radiohead!"" with pride.But this...I just don't know what to say about Amnesiac. It's not a bad album, but after The Bends, OK Computer, and Kid A, it surely is a disappointment. It doesn't stand anywhere near those three or Hail to the Thief in terms of great records. The biggest problem with the album is that it's very inconsistent. It has great songs like ""Pyramid Song"", ""You and Whose Army"", and ""Like Spinning Plates"" next to subpar efforts like ""Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors"" or ""Hunting Bears."" I think it's pretty obvious that some of these songs were B-sides never originally intended for release."
1,"ummm, this band needs to break up.","okay, Kid A was kinda cool, but then this? I know people like this CD, but I feel justified in giving it a 1. Why, you ask? There is not one song (and I've givin it plenty of chances) that I like or even find interesting. My theory: these guys have got themselves so caved up in their own little world they've forgotten how to make music that doesnt just please themselves. Hey, I listen to some pretty outrageous stuff (melt-banana, Ween, Alien Sex Fiend) but this isn't expiremental in a good way, it's only exposing this band's out-of-touch state, and, well, I don't really think Im doing anything but wasting my time telling a bunch of people I'll never know how I feel. BUY IT! IT's RADIOHEAD! THEY CAN DO NO WRONG!"
2,"""Challenging,"" yet not good","I don't care if this album is ""innovative,"" ""envelope-pushing,"" or any other euphemistic adjectives that people are currently using to describe this album. The bottom line is that much of it is difficult to listen to. While that may make the album ""challenging,"" it certainly doesn't make it good. Some tracks, like #2, have beautiful pieces of music arranged in unorthodox ways; unfortunately, those tracks are the exception because much of the rest of the album is just bland and confusing music. I actually think that Kid A had better music by virtue of the fact that I can actually listen to the first half of the album."
1,are they classy? yearrrrr????!!!!,"If kid-A is a bad recording, this one is worse. If music is music not just a compilation of sound, there must be something called'melody' and 'rithym'. ok, i know today everybody must be VERY abstract to demonstrate that he has somekind of class,but then, as i said in the review of Kid-A, it just isn't music anymore. by the way,if you like it, i'd tell you that for the same sufferrence i must take hearing such a recording, i will rather pick up any Stravinsky or Dubussy's crazy compositions. isn't that more classy? radiohead is a middle-talent band, the Bends is the best album they made and that's all."
1,When do you listen to this?,"The disc is almost unlistenable. I was very disappointed. My two and a half year old son and I had to get in the van and go to the camper and I played the disc for the first time. It is not even music and I dont no when I would even play it. Not around friends, not around the wife, and my two year old made it clear not around him again. Get the picture.I dont understand any review over one star. Radiohead says they do not want to be pigeon holed into the ""O.K. Computer"" band. That is fine with me. But where are the melodies and lyrics? I wanted something I could sink my teeth into. After repeated listenings, I still want to burst out laughing it is so bad. Unfortunately, you have to buy it to get the full disappointment. Look what ""Zooropa"" did for the four lads from Irelands career. I will exercise more caution on the next release."
3,Whats going on here,"Recently, awesome bands have been putting out less than awesome material, weezer, tool, now radiohead is giving us something that isnt bad, but isnt better than the last, in this case im ignoring Kid A and Im saying if you have ok computer, and you love it, you can buy amnesiac, but its nothing spectacular so you really dont have to."
2,the thin line between creativity and bad music,"After Radiohead's brilliant ""Kid A"" CD, I was much looking forward to their ""Amnesiac"" album. unfortunatly, after listening to ""Amnesiac"" I can't help but to be dissapointed. I respect (and usually enjoy) Radiohead's creativity, but this time they took it overboard. I just couldn't get into it, like I could with Kid A. I wasn't taken to that magical place I go to everytime I listen to the previous album. After listening to the new release, I was frustrated and had a headache. I think with a stronger musical backbone (some sort of rythm), ""Amnesiac"" would have been brilliant. However, I can't help but feel that Radiohead got lazy after their grammy nominated ""Kid A"" album."
1,Sounds like uncovered Bowie and Joy Division scraps,"Radiohead has not broken any new ground with this album or Kid A. Anti-rock was done in the 70's with vastly superior results by the likes of Joy Division and others. The band's sound has become trite and is full of pretensiousness and egoism. I think Radiohead's wet dream is to be like Joy Division. From the sound of this record, they have failed miserably."
2,Kid A's ugly cousin,"Kid A part 2 but not as good.1. packt like sardines ok song...EiiRP is better2. pyramid song.. thought it was great first few times but now i think its cheesy.3. pulk/pull ok4. you and whose army.. decent, maybe good.. but their live version messed up the image for me with colins ugly vocals.5. i might be wrong.. i like this one6. knives out.. i like this one7. morning bell... again? was perfect the 1st time.8. dollars and cents .. i like this one9. hunting bears... fine i suppose10. like spinning plates.. almost good but mostly just dribble.11. life in glass house.. spinning plates part2.."
3,Not as good as OK Computer,"This CD is definately not like Radiohead's first three CDs. OK Computer was one of the greatest CDs every recorded, and then they followed it up with the dissappointing KID A. Disappointing for me at least. I do have to commend the band on trying new sounds, but I still like the songs that include guitar instead of synthesizers. Amnesiac is much like KID A in the fact that there are few heavy songs with guitar, like OK Computer had. It is better than KID A, though because they use piano on many tracks which can be soothing, it's just too bad they couldn't have diversified the songs more. The best songs on the album are Pyramid Song, Knives Out, and I Might Be Wrong. It does have some pretty bad ones also, like the unlistenable Life in a Glass House. If you're looking for OK Computer material this isn't it; if you liked KID A you'll definately enjoy this one."
4,"Once again, another exquisite album for Radiohead","This album is sort of a continuation of Kid A, but it is sensational in its own way. This is a dark and gloomy album like Kid A, but beautiful to listen to as well. ""Like Spinning Plates"" is really one of the coolest songs I've ever heard."
5,Better than Kid A,"Although Amnesiac was recorded during the same sessions as Kid A, to me it is an album of its own. Many may disagree with me, but I think this album is much better than Kid A (and I love Kid A). There are parts of Kid A that are hard to grasp (musically that is--Radiohead's lyrics are always hard to grasp), but Amnesiac feels more even than Kid A. I see it as a cross between Kid A (with the electronic vibes) and OK Computer (with some more accessible melodies and instrumentation). A very good album. Easily the best and most original I've heard in a long time. It's amazing that this is the same band that made Pablo Honey and The Bends (although those are great albums too)."
5,It's Radiohead it must be good,"an it is, a further departure from the guitar rock that started with Pablo HOney and slipped a little from each cd unitl you have this beat driven, synthesizer produced cd. It's good and a fine follow up to Kid A but it's not as good as the first Techno electronica cd done by radiohead."
4,Slightly Inferior to Kid A,"Like William Baldwin to Alec Baldwin, it's just a wee bit lesser of a product."
4,Amnesiac is Sper neat,"I have to say the first time I listened to Amnesiac I was a little disappointed, but as time passed and as I listened to it more I began to fall in love with this brilliantly done album. It keeps you entertained and interested. I gave this album only 4 stars because Kid A and Pablo Honey are their way better albums. Amnesiac is great and I recommend that everyone should a copy of this album."
4,OK,"A lot like Kid A, and I loved Kid A. My favorite song is ""I might be wrong."" I like Radiohead's new direction, and people wishing for the older CD's should listen to the CD much more deeply."
4,Only for REAL fans of music.,"First, i wanna say I'm one of those people that doesn'tread magazine reviews to find out what are the cool cds tobuy. I'm a radiohead fan til death and bought this cd becauseso and the reason i love them so much is that THEY DON'T GIVEA DAMN ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK. Every cd they put out is a drastic change from what they put out before but it's still some of the best damn music that you will here EVER. Just listen to it yourself. I'm not even going to waste time trying to describe what it sounds like. If you like good but different music, buy this cd not now but right NOW. (Only reason i gave this four stars because I don't think most people will be able to digest this cd. Sorry.)"
2,Kid A's scraps and the worst Radiohead effort yet,"This sounds like bad outtakes from Kid A. There are a couple of good songs, but this is the band's worst album. A trite little disc from a band that is getting full of itself. Kid A was also overrated, sounding like a Joy Division album with updated sounds for the new century. One of the songs was such a blatant rip-off that it was almost as good as Joy Division. I'm not into gimmicks and muzak, so I guess I'll just have to keep listening to The Bends."
5,"Fighting, clawing, and tearing your way back onto the edge","Radiohead have done it. They have accomplished the impossible. They took a band that was teetering on the brink of promoting bloated, pompus arena rock and turned it into a truly independant collective of audio artists. They turned a mainstream breakthrough and drove it back underground through sheer force of will and vicious tenacity. They got their edge back, and how. Dull knives are fun to play with, and kids can handle them, but this razor cuts, it cuts deeply, and requires super-vision. Experimention with total honesty isn't always the prettiest thing to listen to, but it is the most beautiful. Be brave.Lets stop comparing Amnesiac/Kid A to OK Computer and the Bends, shall we? If we as a listening audience haven't grown in the last few years, if we haven't matured, we don't deserve artists who have the incredible freedom to record what they want and still have the wheels of the corporate mega machine turn in their favor."
3,Continuing and refining their new technique,"3 1/2 starsPeople seem to think this is a subpar album to it's counterpart Kid A..While some of the songwriting does seem to be a little underdeveloped, I actually feel like this album has a little more substance then Kid A does...A few extra songs, some reconciliation with their experimental tendencies and their ability to produce heartbreaking songs, show an album that was less intent on providing a contrasting artistic statement to their previous work and more intent on just pulling off the songs in the context they were written in...Ideally, Radiohead should have trimmed a few of the less-then-neccesary songs from both kid a and amnesiac and should have produced THE album of that 5 year period, instead of diminshing the effect with the spliiting of sessions..No matter, for even the scraps of musical shards the band produces hold magic inside..."
5,I'm a blithering idiot!,"Disregard my previous review! This album deserved 5 stars! I apologize for not realizong this sooner. It just hit me this morning. I don't know why it took all this time, but It finally grew on me. So please forgive me, I have seen the light! I now LOVE this album! Go! Buy it! NOW!!"
2,New Misadventures in Hi-Fi,"Jesus. As someone who warmed to the difficult, but strangely beautiful ""Kid A,"" I eagerly awaited this title, particularly as the buzz indicated a more ""song oriented"" spin on the previous work. ""Amnesiac"" is a bin of cast-offs from the ""Kid A"" sessions, and is the most tedious album I've heard since Yes' ""Tales from Topographic Oceans"" way back in my teen years in the '70s. Boring drones dominate the proceedings, with even more filtered vocals and obtuse melodies. It's all well and good for Thom Yorke to feed his Brian Eno jones. It's quite another thing to confuse ambience with art; creating one doesn't guarantee the other. Excellent production rates it two stars."
2,"2 stars, cause all the rest are better.","Are the other reviewers kidding me? This album is by far the worst they have done. It contains 3 ok songs, the singles, following by one that is played backwards! Alright, Kid A was great, it was different and sounded marvelous, but this is just extracts from it that didnt make Kid A. In Amnesiac, they're trying to bring the sound of Kid A and mix it with The Bends and trying to keep the ""new fresh ever changing sound of Radiohead"". They've admitted they miss the guitars now, and i'm glad because they can't keep making Amnesiacs."
3,B sides are still B sides,"The only reason I give this album as much as 3 stars is because there is still a hint of the genius that comes from the Kid A album. This album contains songs from the Kid A sessions. Songs that didn't make the cut, so to speak, and it shows. Whereas Kid A has a manic symmetry to it, this album sounds thrown together with the leftovers of yesterday's fantastic meal. I guess I shouldn't be too hard on the band. I look at this album in the same vein as U2's album, ""Zooropa"" (a far superior album on all counts - that's a review within a review, folks!) which was slapped together while U2 were on tour. So, unless you're prone to night-sweats from not having every album produced by your favorite band, leave this one alone."
2,"I want to Forget ""Amnesiac.""","How can Radiohead possibly get more ""progressive"" than this? That's what I want to know. If Radiohead produced a song out of distorted farts and a jaw harp, critics would hail it as a ""Progressive masterpiece!"" Half the songs on this album aren't even songs--they're just mumbling, blubbering, lackluster pieces of electronic crap. ""Pyramid Song"" and ""Knives Out"" are particularly good, but most of this album is difficult to listen to--it totally lacks any emotion or energy. And how can they perform this ""stuff"" live? Do they ""rock out"" on stage with a bunch of synthesizers. Come on! What happened to the army of guitars from ""The Bends"" or ""OK Computer."" Well, needless to say, I'm not giving Radiohead anymore credit just because they are Radiohead. Unless they regress and create some actual music, I'm not giving them my money. I don't care if it's artistically improper to regress. I just want some music with emotion. Give me The Bends!"
1,Oh please!,"In a word, awful. The emperor has no clothes, no heart, no soul. Endless acolytes saying, ""Sure, it's not OK Computer, but still another masterpiece, blah, blah, blah"", amuse me. Cacophonous, self-important noise by arteest, Thom Yorke. Some music will survive 50 years, some 50 weeks. Literally and figuratively this music will not last 50 minutes...dreadful!"
1,Will the real RADIOHEAD please stand up?,"Kid A was a great CD, but not Radiohead. Not only is this CD not the Radiohead we all know and love, but it is nearly unlistenable. Radiohead has every right to go off on this musical tangent. Just as their fans have the right not to purchase this dreck as I, unfortunately, did. Save your money until the real Radiohead stands up. If this is the permanent direction of Radiohead, then I accuse them of killing off potentially one of the greatest rock bands in history."
2,"okay, they lost me here","Radiohead delivers amnesiac as a follow-up to the much anticipated yet somewhat misunderstood Kid A. From here, it should become clear that leftovers are leftovers for a reason. In Ryan Adam's recent three albums of 2005, his plan was to release all music from one session and make not one album but three. The result. Fillers. Radiohead, however, made a remarkably experimental album in Kid A, and while by no means their best, remains severely underrated. Anesiac is almost the opposite. It was created from unreleased sessions from Kid A, and while a few songs such as ""I Might Be Wrong,"" ""Pact,"" and ""Hunting Bears"" remain true to form, most of these should have remained sessions. Sorry guys, bravo to the max for absolutely everything prior, but I can't really get into this one. I hated Kid A at first, kept retrying until I loved it, but I'm afraid that its just not working with this one. I'll give it an extra star for its three decent songs and for it being made by radiohead."
2,What were they thinking?,"It is hard for me to give a truly meaningful review on this album. I was just beginning to become a Radiohead fan at the time of purchasing this album. I had become quite a fan after listening to OK Computer and had the intentions of looking deeper into this band, so a went out to aquire this album. I'm sorry I did. I put this Cd into my player once. That was one too many times. Ever since then I have not purchased another Radiohead album and do not have the ambition or the drive to seek another. Don't be fooled, as I was. That is all. Thank you."
1,Whats happened to radiohead?,What has happened to radiohead that is the question.I think compared to the old radiohead(well compared to anyone actually)this is absolutely pathetic and i am disappointed in them
1,I have had enough of this pretensious rubbish !!!,"This album stinks to the same degree as ""Kid A"" ! Radiohead are capable of sublimely constructed pop classics... but you will find none of them here or on their previous dire offering ! The most upbeat song on the new album is ""The Pyramid Song"" and that in itself is depressing in the extreme.I cannot understand their success in the US. Has anyone over there listened to ""The Bends"" or ""OK Computer"", 2 albums on which they had the guts to do what they do best...brilliant catchy songs ? This new stuff is far too experimental and depressing.I hope they fail miserably with this rubbish and return to what they are good at."
2,"Okay, they lost me here","Radiohead delivers amnesiac as a follow-up to the much anticipated yet somewhat misunderstood Kid A.

2,Radiohead-the band that would save rock. right.,"""Im so tired of the ""Rock"" thing, arent you?""Hey people, you made him.That was what old Thom said when being interviewed about this album. Thats just super.Hey people, you made him.I will give them one thing, atleast we will see how many sheep will stay in the little Radiohead herd once they are no longer the ""Cool"" emo band that people like to think they are.This is right up there with Veder and Companies ""Vitology"" as the swan song of a band that needs one."
1,Terrible,"I cant begin to say how disappointed I am with this album. I just wish they would go back to the days of ok computer. But its another experimental artistic album which in my opinion has definately NOT hit the nail on the head. Apart from the song knives out the rest of the songs are completely weird and the drum beats are terrible. I really hope radiohead has disappointed me for the last time and hopefully one day they will go back to playing the music which made me worship them. ie songs like airbag, creep, talk show host."
5,Where'd you paak the caah?,"Um, there are no words to describe. Radiohead=no words to describe. I invent new ones: orgasmiative, ritronic, extraplanetary, trulish, epiphanic... if you've heard it you know what I mean. If you haven't you've got a reason to live."
1,Missed,"...Why oh Why did Radiohead have to put this out. I thought they could do no wrong, and they [messed] up and so very badly. While Kid A was IDM-lite, it had its charms and its masterpieces, like The National Anthem. Amnesiac is horrid, its so half-assed, that any Warp alum could duplicate it with minimal effort. ""But its got layers dude, that you haven't explored,"" the hell with that. This album is twaddle, that goes nowhere and right when a song is about to get interesting it stops, so yes I would classify this as self-indulgent nonsense that deserves to be thrown away with the rest of the trash."
4,The Next Kid A?,"Radiohead's latest cd can be looked at as a remix of Kid A and a stripped down OK Computer. I believe is much more than that and is a great cd. Radiohead refuses to be limited to labels of their own musical style....Radiohead continues to strive for what they consider to be musical perfection and it shows in every album they make. True fans will love this cd for what it is, a no apologies, all out search and expression of the musical self."
3,hmmmm....,"My problem with Radiohead is this. They are obviously brilliant. And I feel bad for not really really adoring this album. It's worthy of adoration. But- it's cold. It's distant, far away stuff- you can't like the people involved, you aren't convinced to. I need heart in my music.That being said, Pyramid song has the beauty of an icicle, and is enough to keep the cd in my stereo for long long periods of time."
3,Amnesiac,"It was a great CD, but I feel that Radioheads band members were pushing themselves too hard to further implement the musical style pioneered on ""kid A"". They are no doubt, a band that continues to change with each album, but what I think upsets most people about Amnesiac is the ""hard to rock out to"" nature of the album. It's filled with melodic, techno-influenced songs that can often be very relaxing if you give them a chance. I give it a three because I simply don't like it in comparison to some of their other albums, although it is a beautiful display of Radiohead's artwork."
5,Can't believe people are so narrow minded,"This is one of those rare albums that just grows and grows on you. I've listened to this now for however long it's been out and it just gets better and better. Don't listen to narrow minded people who claim to be 'true Radiohead fans' who say this album is not up to scratch. It's a total departure from their original stuff, but deal with it! If these people were fans then they'd move on, just like Radiohead's music has.This album is absolutely awesome, and is a must-have for your collection. Listen to it, and listen again."
3,Radiohead goes further away...,"Radiohead is a great, innovative band that has never ceased to amaze and impress the hell out of me...until now. ""Amnesiac"" was touted as a more song-oriented record. Though I love ""Kid A"" and it's spacious brilliance, ""Amnesiac"" is uglier, more difficult and definitely NOT more song oriented.I love bizarre music, the more ambitious the better, but ""Amnesiac"" largely fails to speak to me.I applaud Radiohead for pushing, and pushing hard, but this album is cold and it seems like their trying too hard to be weird, thinking that their pretty much invincible. They may be, but personally, this is their least enjoyable album since ""Pablo Honey"".Don't get me wrong, I practically worship this band, but I'm also honest. Check it out if you're curious, but I think you'll find it massively less appealing. You're on your own with this one, kids."
5,Another excellent Radiohead CD,"I just bought Amnesiac a few days ago, and it has been an addictive listening experience. Radiohead is a truly innovative band.... Part of the beauty of buying a Radiohead CD is not knowing exactly what you're going to get but knowing that whatever it is, it will be exciting and challenging. Amnesiac is just that--it is not ""Kid B"", as some will refer to it. This album is markedly less electronic than Kid A. Amnesiac has some truly beautiful, powerful moments. Pyramid Song is my personal favorite. It is a beautiful, haunting song that sticks in my mind and warrants repeated listening. All in all, Amnesiac is a rewarding listening experience, and I highly recommend it for all Radiohead fans."
4,Pretty Good,"This work by Radiohead captures a quenticentail Radiohead style with intense songs that are both quiet and stimulating (emotionally) such as 'Pyramid Song', a personal favorite. A few of the songs are a little disappoiting and don't fit entirely into the flowo of the Cd, but for the most part this CD is definetely a new favorite of mine."
5,Out...Standing!,"It took a couple of sit downs with this CD to understand what's going on here. Once you do, you won't stop listening to it. Hats off!"
4,Amnesiac: NOT the mainstream album,"If Kid A was supposed to be experimental, Amnesiac is...very hard to define. This album goes all over the place. Jazz, Techno, even a little bit of Hip-Hop (if I say so myself) are all the musical genre covered by a band who have stepped out of the mainstream themselves.The reason why this album is being bashed my the media is that (1 Even though the shock value has been taken out by Kid A (2 This album is waayyyy out of left field, basically Kid A without the sedatives.As I've said, just because there are guitars on this record dosen't mean they've gone back to their Bends days. ""Like Spinning Plates"" and ""Pulk"" are the 2 most creepy yet innovative yet bizarre songs released by ANY band. This is a direct companion to ""Kid A"", and it shows."
5,Proof positive they are the best!,"This is one big sonic milkshake. There are no ends or beginnings or ends or beginnings, it just goes on and on. I cant stop the cd, it is now in it's fourth rotation and I feel like I'm trapped in some far off galaxy that I never want to come back from. At first I thought it sounded kinda slow , but then it starts to pull you in. Soon you have taken so many combinations of left and right turns that you're totally lost. This album does hint at Kid A but it is very different and very very solid. I think Kid A is great, but this album caters to a different mood. It's dark but not depressing. The noise is just too blissful to be sad, but it is very emotional. I reccomend Ok computer before you get this album. I think ""OK"" is a good first album cause it is a very agreeable sound and is flawless. I think this is a must have for any collection. These guys are stretching the realm of Rock and incorporating all we've allready learned about good music into their work."
3,Crazy Amnesiac!,"Amnesiac is a crazy trip through many kinds of music textures. You can hear the guitar or the bass, but they are in a sea of madness. Maybe the only song that[s NORMAL is I MIGHT BE WRONG...the rest is really weird, but not the BRILLIANT weird of KID A....well, this one is BY FAR the RADIOHEAD album i like less...."
3,Who's kidding whom?,"If this was not Radiohead, (a) nobody would like it that much (b) nobody would even buy it. Radiohead seems so uncomfortable with their success and with their truly great music -- The Bends and OK Computer -- that they have veered off the deep end. It's almost as if they've said to themselves: We're too popular, we're too good. So they put out alienating elektronika like this. I won't give it zero stars because, after all, it still is Radiohead but one more CD like this and I am seriously jumping off the bandwagon. Anybody who feels the same way, they can buy ""Lost Souls"" by Doves, a much better record. Or Badly Drawn Boy. Portions of Amnesiac remind me of Pink Floyd at their worst. Sorry."
5,Another Masterpiece,"Lets for get about RH being musicians all together, artist is a more perfect title for this brillantly talented group. Beautiful from studdering piano to waining lyrics to early era jazz arrangements. Pyramid song's lyrics and studdering musical arrangement are possibly the best sinle the band has created since Paraniod Andriod was released. Statement on society driven Knives Out and Dollars and Cents are standouts. Paranioa is still evident on I Might be Wrong. And who else learns how to play and sing a song backwards. In my opinion Like Spinning Plates and the jazzy Life in a Glass House are the best and most thought provoking songs on the album. Buy this and every RH cd you dont own and buy them soon. Please help us keepThom's new baby clothed"
2,another mistake,"I was not particularly pleased with Kid A. I'm even less pleased with Amnesiac. What happened to the band that gave us Ok Computer and The Bends??? If you felt, as I did, that Kid A was a drab and ultimately boring effort; you'll want to save your money. There is only one, actually good, song on this album, ""Knives Out"". Worth it for that song alone? Probably not. A couple other tunes are somewhat interesting, but would have been better as B-sides. I suggest you buy a used copy. Hordes of let down Radiohead fans will surely be depositing their copy of Amnesiac at your local used record store. With the money you'll save you can buy the new Travis..."
3,trying too hard?,"If you made it this far, then you're already going to buy Amnesiac so... Since the songs were recorded during Kid A they sound very similar to that album, but the surprise of Amnesiac is that it incorporates more standard guitar and drum sections. The problem with Amnesiac, since it is composed of leftovers, is the lack of consistency on the album. There is also the feel that perhaps Radiohead have tried too hard to be different and end up sounding the same. Amnesiac would have made a far better double cd with Kid A, than as a seperate cd release. Fans expecting something new(which is what Radiohead prides itself in producing right?) will be disappointed. For those want something new, Thom's work on PJ Harvey's album, Stories...is great. Amnesiac is a decent record but the real questions Radiohead fans want to know is what direction will they go next...."
4,Perfect for sitting in a room watching blue lights,"I first began listening to Radiohead when I picked up ""Ok Computer"", and soon after picked up their earlier releases and became a fan.The sound on this album is incredible.It's very mellow and ambient, full of far out there effects.While the comparisons to Kid A are somewhat valid, this album is for the most totally different.Thom's vocals drift off in the background while the instruments dominate the entire aural sense you'll experiance.For some people, the sound of this album will be hard to accept, but afte a few listen ( I've listen to it about 4 times since buying it 24 hours ago) it'll easily grow on you.This isn't the kind of record you put out during a party or upbeat moment though.My advice is to sit in a dark room, set up some twisting blue lights and listen to the album.If there's one drawback, it's the fact that it's only about 45 minutes long, an album like this should drift about your body for at least an hour.Oh well..."
5,brilliant,"This is yet another brilliant Radiohead release.Thom Yorke has the most beautiful voice Ive ever heard, and the music manages to be hip, ecletic, and heartfelt and gorgeous and deep at the same time. I can totally relate to every single word they're saying.This is a must."
5,One of My Favorite Albums,"I've owned Amnesiac for over a year and a half now. I bought it just for Pyramid Song; I had no idea how many other unbelievable tracks were on this superb album:1. Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box - 8/102. Pyramid Song - 10/10 (My favorite RH song that's been released so far)3. Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors - 7/104. You and Whose Army? - 10/105. I Might Be Wrong - 9/106. Knives Out - 9/107. Morning Bell/Amnesiac - 9/108. Dollars and Cents - 9/109. Hunting Bears - 7/1010. Like Spinning Plates - 9/1011. Life in a Glass House - 10/10All of these songs have good things going for them. There's not really much to say that's already been said by a lot of other people. Amnesiac is one of the best albums they've ever made in my opinion; I reccomend buying it if you haven't already; give it time, give it a chance."
3,amnesiac,"er i'm sorry but this album isn't without flaws i mean like pulk/pull revolving doors sucks big time anyways there are some great songs on it, but for a radiohead album; even Pablo Honey is better!"
3,Experimentalism Exploitation.,"I never really liked Radiohead, other than some of the hits that hit MTV, they just sounded mellow and boring. In their latest venture in to art-music-..., Amnesiac comes off like every other annoying album of theirs, but with an extra taste of how much these guys try to be original and creative, but fail and 'create' just plain experimental [not good]. I'd compare them with some of today's one-hit-wonders, as they are just riding on that distinct sound that was lost so many albums ago, trying to bring it back and get more money... People say Radiohead's members spend tons of time perfecting their albums... Maybe, but why do they still stinkso bad and only catch the attention of fruit-cakes who prefer tea to Coke."
3,"5 for the music, 1 for the artwork.","Loved the music (I give it 5/5), hated the artbook... come on, folks, this is just math class scribbling here, only scribbled with a typewriter and printed on a broken copier. The only thing good about it is that it has to be looked at several times, as it can't be absorbed all at once. Also, it is UGLy. Not that all art has to be beautiful, but... well, I just didn't like the artwork. Kid A's was much better~~it at least had something to identify with (that being that bear)."
3,doesn't sound like folk much,"I checked out this folk music CD and its a fine collection of tunes, but really doesn't sound much like folk at all. You can barely hear the pedal steel guitars or the harmonica. The singer does some fine yodeling, though."
5,Oh how far a band can evolve!,"With Amnesiac being Radiohead's second release this year, it is hard to believe that this is the same band that released 'Pablo Honey' (their first album). This along with Kid A are probably in the top 5 cd's I have purchased this year. The only weak point of this album, is that Trans-Atlantic Drawl was left off of the album. This is available on the Pyramid Song single though. MUST BUY!"
1,The Biggest Pile Of Junk,"This is without doubt is not a very good album. Apart from ""Knives Out"" which sounds like the old Radiohead, every song is so boring. Why can't Radiohead just make albums which are like ""the bends"" now that album was pure genius. Oh Well!!!!"
1,this must be a mistake...,"this is hard to swallow. it is difficult to believe these are the same guys who made the bends and ok computer, two mind-boggling albums. kid a just barely got by with a few really solid cuts. but this...this is not right...i can only shake my head and hope they stick together and make some more real albums in the future. this is bad joke! pyramid song and the video are good, i'll admit that and i like track number one as well. but i think that is about it. and a few of the other songs may turn out to be passable but cetainly not up to radiohead standards.don't get me wrong, i love radiohead. i really do, i think they are amazing, in fact i just paid a nice chunk of change for good seats at their concert. but if they played not a single song from this album, i would be relieved. that is all.."
1,Amnesiac Needs Less Prozac!,"I'd like to forget this album in a big way! Some elitist record execs and every other burt-out rock critic love these guys. These are the same people that did a great deal of drugs in the 60's and 70's folks and it is coming back to haunt US!Never buy this ablum unless you are given six months to live and want death to seem like a pleasant alternative to something here on Earth! In that case, listen to this CD, watch Rosanne Barr sing the National Anthem, and watch the News on Public Television.How high up am I?P@"
3,This is probably the worst Radiohead album out.,"Radiohead has a knack for making music that is consistently better than everything else out on the market. However...this album seems more like someone else that was inspired by Radiohead's Kid A and tried to make an album like Kid A...only not as good as Kid A.Still, this album is better than almost everything played on the radio at the moment. Hopefully their next album will be better than this...Radiohead can do much much better than this."
5,Absolutely Brilliant,"Buy this CD and listen to it more than once before you judge it. Some pieces grab you right away, some may take longer, but they are ALL very well crafted works of art. Pyramid song, Dollars and Cents, Like Spinning Plates and Life in a Glass House are all incredible (and none of the songs on the whole cd sound alike either). My personal favourite is Pulk/Pull revolving doors; a truly innovative song that tells us about the different doors we must walk through in life. Including those that ""you can't come back from"". Weird song, no question about it, but unique, interesting and funky as well.I rank Amnesiac as the second best Radiohead album (Ok Computer being number one, Kid A at number 3, and The Bends at number 4)."
4,"Works great, easier to install than the 5 bay, but has only 4.",It works fine. It is really easy to install. All in all I prefer the 5 bay even with the extra work you have to do to install it simply because its nice to have a system drive and a RAID 0+1 array and that is five drives.
1,Do not buy from Action Village!!,Just recieved them this morning. The color is a burnt brown not the color in the listing. 3 of 3 bags had broken balls and the balls are dented. I called customer service @888-679-4327 the rep started a claim with UPS even though i told her the box was undamaged. She told me the paintballs are sold as is. They do not accept returns nor do refunds. She would call me when UPS let her know about the claim and that it takes 5-8 business days. I told her I bought them to shoot this weekend and 5-8 days will be to late. At this point she told me I could buy more. WHAT???? I wish i could rate them negative stars.
2,Bad paint,"Very inaccurate paint. The price is great and that is what got me to purchase the product, but I would not reuse or recommend. I bought it for practice with my first gun (BT Omega) and it really only worked for the satisfaction of testing the new gun :). When in game, the paint curved hard twenty feet from leaving my barrel. Also chopped (broke in barrel) frequently with rapid fire. The paint balls came in bags where at least 4-5 balls had broken, making the rest of the balls very oily and dirty. I actually threw a hopper full of it away it was that bad. I had other buddies shoot it out of their more expensive guns and they were also unimpressed.2 stars because of low quality but great price."
4,"Fast shipping, great price, decent balls","I've used 1,000 of these balls thus far and they work quite well. They are not top end balls and are not perfectly round but for the price they are great. If your a beginner you can't go wrong with these. They do feel a bit soft compared to other balls i've used and one did break in my gun but 1 out of 1000 is not to shabby.I got these balls shipped using Kinek (new service). I'm from Canada and shipping rates to Canada are crazy high and we usually get hit hard with brokerage fee's. I saved close to $10 even with taking gas into account by shipping to a KinekPoint just across the border. Shipping is way cheaper and you don't get hit with brokerage fees. I usually get a few things shipped there at a time.Loved the balls and loved the price."
4,Great for just random shots,"Most are dented and there are so many mixed colors. I would expect that for the price. Great for just standing on the back porch and trying to shoot at random things. These are great for practice, but don't fly true. Glad I bought them because I don't always play serious Paintball but I didn't feel like I was waiting money shooting trees and cars in my driveway."
1,Don't do it!!!,"I ordered 5 cases of the 1500 count paintballs from Action Village. of the 15 bags of 500 (3 per case), 12 bags had broken paintballs in them. Action Village will not take broken paint back so I tried picking out the broken paintballs and drying off the ones that looked good using a towel in a bin, but they ended up braking in our hoppers and guns making a huge mess and delaying our games. I would not recommend buying this product from Action Village. The time you waste cleaning guns and hoppers between games will negate (and then some) any savings you thought you were getting."
3,broken paintballs,"Almost an entire bag of paintballs were broken, I tried to seperate the broken ones and tried cleaning the ones that were not broken, when my son used them they broke in his holder and jammed it up. Not good. The balls that were in the other bags worked fine."
4,Good but will stain a little,"These paintballs are excellent for their price,the ones i got were orange and a few were lopsided but other then that worth it.It came packed well with zero broken balls,the only problem i found was that they have a little bit of oil so they could stain your clothes if you did not wipe it off fast."
5,Great,"Viene en un frasco trasparente, completas y listas para usarse y tengas mucha diversión con mil quinientas balas que pintan y que vienen listas para el esparcimiento."
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the three color, and got a box of one color, with some of the product missing. They took out some of the balls to be the same amount as what I ordered, and didn't send me the right box in the first place. I wanted to be able to go some place else, if they could not fill the order, but was not given that choice.. Very disappointed in the response I got to settle this matter. They wanted more time to make this better, but didn't give me the time to tell them I didn't want the product they was sending me."
2,bad,When they came which they came 10 days late the box was wet the balls were pop and some dented and i put them in my gun i shoot nothing comes out i shoot nothing comes out i shoot nothing comes out and i look in and its cloged bad balls
4,"They're paint balls, they explode when you shoot them.","Quite a few of the paint balls had exploded in the bag during shipment, but I don't know how this could be avoided."
2,Mixed balls,"These are okay for test balls, not sure if left over or new but they come in a mix of odd colors. Some were duds in which I was scared to use in my gun, I still have a bunch left."
2,These are ILLEGAL at some paintball arenas in the US!!!!!!,These are extra hard shelled paint balls that will be confiscated from you by owners or employees of whatever paintball arena you play on. they are great for private use but be careful.
4,Goodish balls,"good balls, very frilly though if i dropped from waist high they would break, good for woodball because of less bounces, fill color is very easy to see though (orange)"
3,Not an undergraduate textbook,"This book covers quite a lot of advanced material, in a rigorous fashion. It is quite a demanding introduction to such important concepts as those pertaining to De Rham cohomology, curvature, bundles and characteristic classes. Far more accessible and motivated books exist on the subject for, e.g., the physics student. I suspect that even a well-prepared maths student would have quite a hard time struggling with this book. Returning to the prospective physics student, he would be well advised to have a solid maths undergraduate background in topology, before perusing this book. While this may be desirable, there are plenty other more friendly and less demanding introductions on the same topics.I would therefore recommend this book only as a second-reading.A student would then benefit from the sharp, rigorous and quick presentation of most ground notions in algebraic and differential topology."
1,how bad can a book be?,You can get the drift of some of the book's many shortcomingsfrom the other reviews although their ratings are far toogenerous. ---- Why the authors ever put pen to paper inthe first place is a mystery that may never be answered.
5,floor console,"Bought this for my truck. It works great if you have a flat surface to stick it on. My truck is too small and the item slid around on the floor. It was purchased for the sole reason to keep drinks in place. Needless to say I had to purchase something else that would actually fit in my tiny truck. Other than that, it would work great in a much larger vehicle. It has a little compartment for loose change and other things. Easy to clean and maintain."
3,Odd design,"This is a floor console for suvs or vans - to me, the cup holder is the only useful feature. The back section lid opens directly to the floor. In other word, there is no bottom to this unit. I find that totally waste all that prime storage space."
4,Worth the cost,"I just bought a minivan and was looking for something like this. Cup holders are great, easily adjustable. Compartment flips open to keep papers out of sight. Only one problem. The front top part comes off, much too easy. It came off once while turning from the weight of coffee in cup holders. Other times while picking something up it just fell apart. I plan to cement the top part on. Then it will be a great little console."
4,Good album,If you like that smooth jazz stuff you will like this album. Bass playing is very good. I give it 4 stars since none of the songs inspired me to keep playing this cd over and over. Good to have in your collection but not a must have.
4,Great Table,"This table was given to my 4 year old for his birthday. The minute he saw it, he sat down and started playing with it. He just loves it. It has plenty of room for two or three kids to play and both the duplos and regular legos fit on the table. My only complaint is that the table is VERY short. I also have an 8 year old son and he plays at the table just as much as my 4 year old. We cannot find chairs small enough to fit under this table. I guess they think kids will stand to play, but my kids want to sit and even our smallest kids chairs(from Step 2) do not fit under the table. I think I will have to buy some wooden blocks to extend the legs so we can fit chairs under there. Other then the height, this is a fantastic table for kids of all ages."
3,very spicy cinnamon flavor,"These are very tasty if you enjoy a sharply cinnamon flavor. In fact, I find them almost spicy. Very good texture for a diet bar, but go with the chocolate peanut butter if you want to be truly impressed!"
2,Yuck!,"I haven't tried many protein bars so I can't really compare these to anything but they are horrible! I gagged down the last bite, it was like eating chalk and pennies."
2,Pleasant but beware of errors,"I am using this book as part of my Biblical Hebrew lessons but find that the author has been careless both in his English and Hebrew. The book needs a proofreader as there are missing vowels, misplaced vowels, a discussion of an alphabet letter which depicts the wrong letter and spelling mistakes in the English. The book is generally helpful, but it is unacceptable to have so many errors in a textbook. As a professor of Latin and Greek I can attest to the fact that some of the explanations of grammatical concepts are not correct. The transliteration also has some mistakes and should be used with caution."
3,Strong book for familiarizing yourself with the Hebrew Alphabet,"This book is extremely helpful in getting to know the Hebrew alphabet and pronunciation. The phonetic exercises are very good, and I find myself being reminded of Hebrew words just from hearing similar sounds.The downside is that this book is in no way extensive. Unless you would really enjoy reading the dictionary in the back, there are only about 4-7 examples to help build vocabulary in each chapter, along with the entire chapter of Genesis 1:1.Learning Hebrew is for the patient. I was hoping for vocabulary building exercises similar to those when I learned the Romance Languages: I am running. I ran. You are running. I sent a letter, etc. I would rather have those simple sentences and THEN approach Genesis, rather than building my vocabulary straight from its verses. One can't be expected to learn Italian by diving straight into Dante, but that's analogous to what this book does."
1,not for a beginner,"the lessons were good up until maybe lesson 5. after that it was confusing, and several of the references to a numbered example were misnumbered. it doesn't appear that this book was proofed very well. definitely disappointing, in my humble opinion."
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Great book for students seeking to learn Biblical Hebrew. I did a research and I found that anything Jeff Benner puts out will meet my needs, and indeed it is a keeper. Right to the point and clear teaching without the mumble jumble."
3,Learn to Read Biblical Hebrew,"A basic book with much repetitive information from Jeff Benner's other books. I have enjoyed them, but feel the books involving ""word origins"", etc, have a lot of duplicate information."
4,Great book (4 1/2 stars),"The book was entertaining and a quick read, although I was a little confused because the book seemed more about Evelyn and less about everyone else. Jasmine and Malone were discussed, but Evelyn was the star of the book. The original caller was never discussed again. But Malone's character was the most satisfying. I'd read it again and definitely worth buying."
2,Not one of the better books I've read!,"Barely believeable; dull, rambling plot - a number of uncorrected errors - either poor editing or lack of research. Save your money!"
2,Cheap,"Bought this thinking it would be of high quality. Looks nice, but it stripped out very easily. I would not purchase again."
5,awesome solo debut,"steve van zant finally got out of the shadows with this long awaited solo record with all his great songs and arranging with southside johnny it was worth the wait.this cd really rocks,gets soulful and is as great as anything bruce springsteen has ever put out. buy it don't hesitate."
2,Doesn't even come close to the Met version,"I never thought I'd find myself bored by a Don Carlos! But about after the second act and feeling ho hum - my husband and myself decided to put on the memorable Met version with Freni and Domingo. What a difference! The Levine version, only available in video, I believe, puts this one to absolute shame. We never even finished it - spending the evening watching all the wonderful scenes of Don Carlos in one of our other versions!"
1,yeachhh,"This is the production that unleashed ""The Beast""...singing in the tiny intimate jewl box Theatre du Chatelet, Thomas Hampson began to believe that he could sing Verdi...this production proves again that he CANNOT...after these performances, Hampson began to sing, Macbeth, Ford, Germont and a host of others...all badly and all forgetable...i suppose we will get Hampson as Renato, Amonasro, Miller and Iago before too long...my ears are bleeding already....please stop, Thomas...we can't take it any more"
2,Good voices,"I gave it an extra star because it was interesting and mildly (very mildly) pleasant. This is the most boring thing I've ever sat though, and I only watched an hour and 20 minutes of it. To hell with it. I bet it was influenced by Wagner, I read that Verdi was, more's the pity. (Besides being an anti-Semitic homophobic megalomaniac who couldn't write good music, Wagner was a cad and an idiot.) In an hour and 20 minutes, there were only 2 tunes, one of which (what one reviewer called the veil song) I didn't even like. I have the Italian version on CD and thought I liked it (so what happened?), I only bought this (and wasted a ransom) because I wanted to see it enacted and I wanted to know the story. I should have read the libretto. This thing just goes drearily on eternally with nothing but plot to keep your interest or entertain you. Maybe when I read the story (which I'll do while I decide what to do with this DVD) I'll find out why Carlos and Rodrigue both needed shaves."
1,Defective DVD,"Neither the first DVD that I ordered, nor the second that I ordered after returning the defective first one, would load in my DVD player. Although the label lists the format as DVD Video, they were defective. The manufacturer is listed as Idem Home Video from Andorra. Do not waste your time by ordering this."
2,"Too slow, too soon.","I'm sorry to say I can't review this book in its entirety because, for me, it started out too slow. The idea of a whole town losing their jobs and the pain they were sharing was too negative for me to begin with. I know it's a reality, but hit me with it later in the story somehow. Just couldn't continue."
4,Highly evocative blue collar novel,"Highly evocative novel set in late 1970s/early 1980s de-industrializing Baltimore as seen through the eyes of permanently laid-off steelworker Red Baker. No prior knowledge of the milieu is required: A friend unfamiliar with the geographic and social specifics that Robert Ward describes attests to the fact that it conveys a feel for Baltimore's industrial decline, and the individual tragedies that accompanied its transition to a post-industrial economy."
4,Red Baker review,WEll written and a good read. Opens your eyes to the trials of the unemployed with no skills. This book was hard to put down. Very sad to think there are so many families in this situation now.
5,One hell of a bassy album. Vail has a good sound.,"As a bass player, I find vails playing very exciting to listen to. I've seen him play live with kenny G aswell. This album is a one of a kind, its stylish and classy, but still maintains that rough sound to it."
3,Dated,I liked this book 3 years ago but now I find that it is pretty outdated. Check websites and blogs for more up to date information.
3,Good reference,"To save yourself some money, peruse this book at your bookstore when you have some free time. Since you'll probably only end up considering one home-based business, you'll only really be needing about seven of the 647-pages."
5,A very interesting book by a trusting author,"I quite like this book and find it very interesting. I am always looking for opportunities and the author has done a good job at keeping my interestThis is a great reference point to start and if you're serious about creating a good business for yourself then read this book.I also suggest that you read Untapped Wealth Discovered by Jeff Marquis and Kerry Harrison.This book is very focused on helping you to create niche businesses in niche markets that are ripe for the taking.Moreover, this book has the approval of the American government plus several business experts worldwide and you should read both editions.Read both editions."
2,Not the greatest....,"A bit outdated. Gives you ideas for many different types of businesses but not a book I would buy if I had picked it up at a bookstore and saw it before I paid for it. I'll probably donate it to my local library, not keep it in my own personal collection."
2,Not Her Best Work,"Let me start by saying that I am a fan of Lucy Monroe, however, this book is a swing and a miss.The idea behind the plot was a good one and should have made for intense emotions and gripping reading...not so.The writing was weak and the love scenes very tepid. There didn't seem to be any real emotional connection between the hero and the heroine, and even though their sexual chemistry was supposed to be the one thing pulling them together, even that seemed a little off.In the end, it was a lackluster read, and the villain in the book (and the entire reason the H and h got together in the first place) came across as more silly than evil.I don't recommend this book to anyone unless you are able to get it for free. Give this one a pass."
2,Not one of her best...,"Okay, I am a big Lucy Monroe fan, but this is not one of her best efforts.Something about this story just didn't click like her others do. It lacked chemistry and passion.The story felt rushed and lacked fluidity, everything seemed too artificial and forced. It was a major let down after reading such stellar reviews.If your new to reading Lucy Monroe, I'd skip this one and go for one of her other books such as; The Sheikh's Bartered Bride, Taken: The Spaniards Virgin, Hired: The Sheikh's Secretary Mistress, The Sicilian's Marriage Arrangement, and my all time favorite, Pregnancy of Passion."
3,...,"This is not her best. I couldn't like Tara. Something about her just made her seem...kind of stupid. And Monroe kept repeating how everybody loved her body and how pretty she was and - ugh, it's so hard for us regular people to relate to that.Don't buy it, borrow it from the library or something."
3,Nice figure.,Very detailed. Articulation is decent. Comes with some cool accessories. Even Madusa's head which is a bit disturbing IMO lol. But a great figure overall.
5,great to the last detail!,"he looks so real, the facial expression looks like he wants to kill you. the medusa head flesh looks so realisticeverything is perfect! this guy looks great next to my other toys you dont wanna mess with this guy great toy great price ordered it on friday, got it monday everything went great what more can you ask for."
5,Must have for any God of war fan,"This is a must have for any God of war fan, rather Kratos fan. the anger on his face on the toy is awesome.The hands detach and reattach also they are flexible too which was cool as the blades can then move in any directionreally wished if they had enclosure on his back to put his blades of chaos. lol"
2,no fun,"his hands break apart and the stand it comes with doesn't hold it up, disappointment for the money...."
4,Broad and unabashedly Romantic,"This performance of Dvorak's Ninth Symphony by the Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest under Mariss Jansons takes it more as a Romantic symphony in the vein of Schubert, underplaying the lilt and dance-rhythms of Bohemia/Czechia, Dvorak's own beloved homeland, focussing more on large, Romantic gestures. As such, I believe it couldn't be played more beautiful, and with a feeling for the over-arching, grand melodic lines, but there certainly are alternatives that are at least as good, like for example Rafael Kubelik's recording with the Berliner Philharmoniker (1973).I guess that first and foremost this performance is for aficionados of the Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest under its new chief conductor (of which I am certainly one). Anyhow, this is a beautiful, lushly recorded and nicely idiosynchratic performance."
2,LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE/MUDDY RECORDING,I've heard dozens of recordings of The New World Symphony and this one is disappointing. The performance is nothing special and the recording is hazy. Don't bother with this dog.
4,...and it's got a pretty album cover too!!!,"I am absolutely convinced that Speedy J creates his music three years in the future. Every album that I have bought of his (G Spot, Ginger, A Shocking Hobby), I play it once and go ""meh"". But when I play it a couple of months/years down the road, I cannot believe what a great treasure I have burried in my music collection. Most music is usually tied to the trends of popular thought and culture. His is the medium that creates its own mythology and thus he drums to the beat of his own dance. That is why I tuck the albums away at first because I am unable to see the beauty (as John Locke would have us believe) in a work that has no known contemporary orgins. The number one stand out track on this album (Public Energy No.1) would have to be ""Pure Energy"". It is imbued with the fizzle of champagne on your lips and factory workers slaving in an early 20th century steel mill. Buy it, whatever the cost. Damn the expense, you will love it."
3,Quick toning for those whole like their ball....,"If you are new to using your ball for basic toning then this video will be helpful. You should be aware that living arts has another video out that combines lower, abs and upper body workouts all in one tape. I actually prefer that one even though it does not include everything that you find on the individual tapes.I use this tape to see how far I am progressing and about once every two weeks I whip it out on one of the days I do toning exercises. It's great for helping to tone and to give you balance. Balance equals control and if you can control your body through various exercises your overall performance in any exercise is improved along with your posture and general health. That being said if you want a vigorous ball workout you had better skip this one."
1,"A Great Idea, A Disappointing Workout","I eagerly awaiting the arrival of this tape as change of pace from my ususal workouts of strength training, aerobics, and yoga. I was very disappointed as I feel that it provides no challenge whatsoever. If you have never done pilates or yoga and need to work on beginning to balance your core than you may like this tape but if you work out regularly in the above practices, thus having some core strength already, than you will probably be left as unchallenged and bored as I was. If anyone knows of a challenging tape that I could get to utilize this new piece of exercise equipment please let me know, otherwise it will become yet another toy for my 2 kids."
5,must have for pink floyd-10cc collectors,this is a excellant disc. it is underrated and quite rare in disc form. great guitar and synth. work by Fenn and nick mason is steady as ever.
3,"Funny, But Cheap/Flimsy","We ordered this costume because it looked funny and we thought that our toddler would look great as Elvis. When it arrived I was very surprised at how thin and flimsy it is. Plus the outside of the collar is foam and the foam is not even covered with fabric. When you look at the costume from behind all you can see is the foam collar. It is kind of hideous. It was not extremely expensive, but for the money it should have been thicker fabric (it is see-through so he had to wear clothes underneath)and the foam should have been covered. Overall it is very cute and funny, though. I like the glitter eagle and the sequined pants. My son looked hillarious in it and it was fun for the night."
2,Worked great for a few trips and then fell apart,"I was very pleased with this product and used it about 10 times before the part that plugs into the cigarette lighter cracked. I managed to get a couple more uses out of it until the plastic quite literally crumbled. The housing of the pump itself is fairly well constructed but the plug is ridiculously poor quality, so I suggest using it gently. I'm still looking for a replacement but do not recommend this product at this price."
5,Great portable pump!,"I purchased this pump because I wanted to inflate one of those tubes you tow behind your boat. I needed something that was somewhat water resistant, and that I could clip directly to the battery. This pump fills the bill. The connection to the tube is perfect, and the tube fills very quickly. Also, I can easily clip it to the batttery, and it comes with a cigarette lighter connection too. I highly recommend this product."
4,This thing really blows!,"So I got this to speed up the inflation time on my Achillies inflatable boat and save me some tiring foot pumping. So far it's worked for that task and for filling camp matteresses. It's not a high pressure pump so you will have to finish off inflating your items either with a hand/foot pump or with good ol' lung power. Not super expensive, does what it's supposed to do. Not sure how long it'll last but it's trucking along so far. Might wanna consider getting a little bag to keep it in because otherwise you'll lose track of the attachments. (Ask me how I know...)"
4,"It works, but...","This works, but the nozzle doesn't quite fit in one of our Coleman air mattresses, so I have to hold the nozzle in the valve with one hand while holding the pump with the other. It fits snugly in the valve of our other (older) Coleman air mattress."
1,Coleman 12-Volt QuickPump Water Resistant Air Pump with Hose and Battery Clips,This was not the item I expected. I ordered a similar pump last year but lost the charger cord. This one does not come with a plugin charger but you have to have it plugged in to work. For Camping that is not Practical. So my husband will use it in his hobbies. Also it is not a powerful as the pump that came with the Eureka Air-mattress.
1,Not surprising this was their last album,"Their previous album was titled ""American Excess""...... this one should have beene titled ""Keyboards in Excess"". The songs are very lame, save the title track which is rather catchy. The keyboards dominate here and not in a good way. Listen to any one of their first three albums and then listen to this again. Progress? I hardly think so. Even ""American Excess"" had a decent balance of the AOR stuff against the heavier boogie style. This one is just dreck."
5,Creepy-crawly lovers approve,"It's not just for the garden - some people keep slugs for science projects or as pets (I raise two species!) and this is a nice, safe solution to halt the escape artists!"
2,"Works well, but if only were stronger....","No snails at all in garden. Great. But, only lasted 6 months. If only it were thicker, then it would last....."
3,The adhesive side does not conduct electricity well.,"I know a number of people are buying this to use as a flexible electrical conduit. I just wanted to say that it works very well, as would be expected from copper, but NOT on the aide with adhesive. I didn't meter the resistance, but I didn't get continuity when trying to pass electricity over the adhesive side."
2,Didn't work for me.,"This product didn't work for me. I placed it around the rim of the pots in my container garden with no gaps between where the ends met. Most mornings that I woke up to check it, there was always a trail of slug slime showing that they had crawled across it in the middle of the night and back across it when they had finished feeding on my veggies. In all honesty, it was a waste of my money."
3,For advanced runners,"I'm not saying this book is bad - it looks very good, but it is not for my level of running. It is for very good runners who have a lot of time to devote to getting even better. It is extremely technical, with all kinds of complex measurements, formulas, etc. I guess I should have expected that with ""formula"" in the title. I just thought the formula would be easier."
5,Excellent and detailed guide to running,"This is a very detailed and complete guide about running. It contains explanations for each type of training, what are their purposes and how to best apply them on your own training regimen. It also provides a few training schedules and teaches you basically how to create your own training schedule or to adapt their training schedules to your needs."
5,Outstanding,Read this book cover to cover in an hour and a half. Charts and explanations were detailed and applicable for every distance. Now I know why he's the guru of distance running.
5,Outstanding book!,Wonderful book that's useful for amateur and professional runners as well as coaches! I highly recommend this book for all runners. Performance prediction using the VDOT formula is accurate.
4,Great Information,"This is a great source of scientific information about running. The ways to become a better runner are explained well. I really like the VDOT section, since speedwork has always been a problem for me, at least in terms of pacing. I respect the author's work in the running community, and I really hope that his advice and guidance help me this year. The best part of this book is that it is not a marathon training book, but an advanced running book."
5,Excellent customer satisfaction,"If I recall correctly it was a Saturday or Sunday (I want to emphasize a non-business day), when I had placed my order. Almost an hour after, I received a direct email with a concern from the company. They wanted to let me know that there was a crease on the cover of the book. I asked to see the crease, they had quickly scanned it and I could barley see it. So i had asked if they could take a picture of the book and send it to me and they did. Again I hardly see the crease so I took a chance and went through with the order anyway. When I received the book again, I couldn't visually tell where the crease was but I could feel it. It amazed me that they were willing to contact me for something so minor, the condition is amazing as if the back has never been broken in. I recommend buying from them!"
3,Reads like a textbook,I thought I was an obsessed marathoner until I read this book. The running plans truly are formulaic. I thought I had inadvertently purchased an organic chem book on accident
5,great book,"Maybe the best running book of all the time,only one minus - there's no plan for half marathon."
4,Probably the single most useful book for distance runners,"I've read probably a dozen or more books on training for distance running and am a long time student of the sport. DRF is the most useful book out there, especially for the layperson. JD explains the physiology underlying running performance in very easy to understand ways and gives the reader a chart of training paces based on performances at distances of 1500m to marathon which takes all the guess work out of devising one's own workouts or coaching kids. I give the book four stars because I feel it does not stand alone for the serious athlete, and I feel the training plans are suboptimal, but overall DRF is a must-have book for any runner or coach."
5,Great Book!,This book is fantastic! Gets into why you do certain workouts without getting so technical you can't understand it.Also has training plans for a variety of experience levels and distances.A must read for runners!
3,Please re-release in SP mode or better yet on DVD,"This is a truly great performance from very gifted cast of Placido Domingo, Kiri Te Kanawa, Thomas Allen, etc. I've seen number of opera productions on TV or video, this is certainly one of the best. They are in great voice and all of them are truly good actors, too. I really wish I could recommend this video. But the original VHS release is now out of print, and the releasing company made a terrible decision of recording it on EP mode, thus producing an inferior quality in video transfer. At the price tag of $30, this is totally unacceptable."
5,Dame Kiri & Placido: 2 Outstanding Singing Actors!,"To jump ahead, Act 4 of this opera lovers'opera is not to be believed!2 luminaires of the opera world combine to set the screen on fire! Such an idealistic beginning to have such a tragic end. This is an epic Manon Lescaut.Dame Kiri,a wonderfulcountess in Strauss'Capriccio,wrenches all my emotions to the surface with her portrayal of Manon Lescaut.Placido is magnicentas the spurned lover returned.This presentation is a 2 hour master class.The beautiful melodies continually flow.Thomas Allen is a wonderful Lescaut.The orchestra of the Royal Opera house under Giuseppe Sinopoli is flawless.Not unlike Jacqueline Dupre,Fitz Wunderlich& Arlene Auger,Giuseppe Sinopoli was a musical genius taken too early from us by death.His passion for his art is most evident in his conducting of the intermezzo.Whata wonderful production!Bravo!Bravo!Bravo!"
1,"A sad, slanted view of a lovely habitat...","Many exquisite photos grace this volume, as well as some interesting facts. However, the excessive references (both in photos and text) to trapping, fishing, and hunting frequently intrude upon what could otherwise have been an enjoyable and informative coffee-table-type introduction to the marsh habitat. Those who love the marsh for its beauty and for non-violent enjoyment of its wildlife might want to look for a more wildlife-friendly book. The graphic descriptions of skinning animals are especially offensive and unnecessary."
5,This Book is Fabulous,"I love this book. It is so inspirational and easy to read without getting lost in the ""holiness"" of it all. A lot of times I am turned off by religion because most of the time it just doesn't deal with the practicality of everyday living. If you are looking for a nice approach to religion this book is for you as well as for newly married couples, teenagers, singles, and anyone who might be in need of inspiration and hope."
5,A gift for anyone in trouble,"This is a book that covers our most difficult times and walks us through the struggle of finding the right words to use when our mind feels drained of all ability to comunicate with our Christ. Althought we know He is there all the time, there are times we need to be reminded of the right way to pray. Just reading the words brings us back to the reality that there is a silver lining behind the darkest clouds. I have given this book to a friend whose daughter was anorexic and it is traveling the circuit of her friends parents. I will keep several on hand for just that purpose!"
2,Great book,It was a good book and I enjoyed the perspective. A good read for anyone doing social reserach! I would reccomend it!
1,Sony is a thorn in my.....,"I have to admit that I was suckered in on this TV from all the ""wonderful"" professional reviews. Well in their defense, the TV did work great for a little over a year and then suddenly developed colored vertical lines down the left side of the picture. Of course the warranty had ran out and doing an internet search revealed just how problematic Sony LCD TVs are after the initial warranty period.There is an old phrase that is applicable here, ""Live and Learn"" (or is it ""Buyer Beware""). So after spending a couple of thousand dollars on this particular life lesson, I can assure you that I will never buy anything else from Sony."
3,Too many Digital Artifacts Visible,"This Sony KDL40S2000 40"" Bravia Flat Panel LCD HDTV is a bit disappointing. This unit brigs out a lot of imperfections in DVDs. Unless you get a pure digital signal, this HDTV seems to enhance imperfections in your video source. It's a good unit but I do not like how it enhances digital artifacts from many DVDs that I watched on it last weekend. Standard cable other than HD looks unacceptable. Perhaps the store was getting a weak signal."
3,HDMI input problems,"Great picture. Only one complaint: when switching from standard definition to high definition channels, the screen goes blank, although the sound continues to work. The TV must be turned off and on again and the high definition picture appears.Sony sent a repairman and the fix was to use a different input, not HDMI. Not much point in a HDMI input if it can't be used."
3,HDMI Problems,"Great picture. One BIG complaint. I am using HDMI from the cable box. When switching from standard definition to high definition channels, the screen goes blank, although the sound continues to work. The TV must be turned off and on again for the high definition picture to appear again. This is unsatisfactory considering that SONY is a premium brand at a premium price."
4,Sony Bravia LCD TV,"The Sony Bravia KDL40S2000 40"" LCD TV delivers a clear,near real image. The set-up was quick and the instructions were easy to read and understand. All cable and set-up accessories were simple to install and operate. Sony has certainly solidified their product image with this electronic HDTV."
4,Great LCD TV,"The picture quality is extraordinary. However, we do have it hooked up to HD cable so I'm not sure of the quality if you are planning on using a substandard service. It has all the output/input technology but has only one HDMI input. So if one was planning to have say, a Blu-Ray DVD hooked up to it, I don't think you'd have the ability to realize both HD cable and a Blu-Ray player capabilities."
1,TV broke within 2 years,"We purchased this TV and were very happy with it, then we started getting blue spots in the corners, which developed into blue rectangles in the lower corners, which got bigger and now are red rectangles in both lower corners that take up 1/3 of the screen - very annoying.Had a repair man out, who spent many hours with Sony and the best they could do is to replace the screen for only $1000.00 which is almost what we paid for the TV. We still use the TV until we can afford to get rid of it, but now it is getting fuzzy pictures as well.Playing rock band on the TV, you can't read the words."
4,Great for watching HD programming,"The TV is the best thing when you are watching HD programming. But the disappointment comes along when you watch standard definition programming on the TV. I found the standard definition program quality worse than my old 21"" RCA CRT TV.1 suggestion I have is to not hold off buying quality component video cables. They change the picture quality by a great deal! Also, keep the power lines away from the audio/video cables to improve the quality."
2,Disappointing,I bought Cabin Fever & Heartland many years ago & loved them. I thought this CD would provide more great examples of their music. Sadly I was mistaken.
1,Nope. It is the worst.,"Even the worst of the worst films might have a single retainable quality- not this one. I don't believe blame should be directed towards the actors' performances- the acting wasn't poor, the dialog was. I know, I've worked on the set. Two weeks into it, I quit after realizing the disastrious potential and the necessity to take my name off the credits.This movie started as a business decision- it's difficult for Hollywood to make money off any single project motivated by market, much less an individual with no previous experience in film, photography or creative writing. Thus, bad composition, bad lighting, bad timing, and cheap shots such as featuring a sympathetic star leads to the end result. This is the most factual, non-biased review I can give and it is this: watch this movie if you can. This is THE one film encompassing everything you shouldn't do in film- a wonderful educational piece."
1,Worst movie ever made? Possibly.,"I am certain there are worse movies than this -- for example films made for high school film class electives. But there is nothing good or even average about this movie. The acting is truly the worst I have ever seen; there is nothing that even comes close. And I include ""Plan Nine from Outer Space,"" the movie that is well-recognized for being the worst movie ever made. Julie & Jack looks like it was filmed on a hand-held video camera, held as steady as someone with a bad case of the DT's could hold it, the lighting is wretched, the sound is abysmal, the story is just shy of ludicrous and I could go on, but I won't. Somehow I got suckered into getting this on NetFlix and my only regret is I watched it alone. It would have been fun to heckle it with a friend."
3,"A romantic, love story... average, yet interesting","Julie and Jack was a movie that made me reflect on what matters in life... the ones we love. The shots around the San Francisco area brought back beautiful memories of the city and redwood trees. I really identified with many of the characters. I thought the performances were good, some moments were extrodinary. The hidden reveal when Julie dies was very touching. It was a pleasant and easy watch movie. I saw this movie at the Gaffers Film Festival and enjoyed meeting the talent."
3,THE SWORD OF SKELETOR by Roger McKenzie and Fred Carrillo,"The Sword of Skeletor is a 1983 Masters of the Universe children's book written by Roger McKenzie and illustrated by Fred Carrillo. Here, Mer-Man steals He-Man's half of the Power Sword for Skeletor so he can get into Castle Grayskull.This story was written for pretty small kids, but it's middling any way you look at it: get in with the usual two-halves plot, plug some toys, throw in some deus ex machina, and get out. Carrillo's art is adequate: he has a good eye for a scene, but his figures are stiff.Points of interest for long-time He-Man fans:-So, on a rare occasion where Skeletor gets the upper hand, Zodac decides this isn't fair and helps He-Man out. Man, Skeletor can't catch a break.-On page 2, He-Man's leading some kind of massive D-Day invasion force. No wonder the initial battle only takes half a page.Any way you look at it, The Sword of Skeletor is just passable. At this point, it's for collectors only."
3,Cutting Board,"The board fit very well over the counter. The problem I have with it is the surface is very slippery. When you starting slicing or dicing your food, the food starts slipping around. Also the handles do not have any stoppers in them, so they fall out. I had my old cutting board (another brand) hanging off the inside of the cabinet door below the sink. I am unable to do this with the Progressive because the handles come out."
2,Annoying to Use,I bought this for my mom because her counter space is limited and she would always just put cutting boards on top of the sink when cutting veggies. It seemed so dangerous so I got this cutting board. Since then she's complained a lot about the adjustable handles of this cutting board detaching/slipping out during use. That was actually more dangerous. I was real disappointed with this product and wish there was some gripping detail on the handles that sit on the sink edges. I may have to just make one for my mom.
3,Eh...,"I have yet to use it, but already have a problem, the handles slide right out. I am sure it is for the variations of sink widths, but they come all the way out, there is no guard to keep them in."
1,Worst Cutting Board Ever,"Had a hard time finding over-the-sink cutting boards. Wish I never found this one. Handles constantly sliding in and the whole board and whatever is on it falls into the sink. Very disappointed, do not recommend."
3,Bicycle Grandma,"I enjoy using it as a cutting board over the sink, however, it tends to hold water as I'm washing the fruits or vegetables I'm cutting. I've had another over-the-sink cutting board that was positioned slightly higher and did not collect water. I actually wore that cutting board out. However, I'm happy to find a replacement for my previous product. This item is so useful and it is very hard to find."
4,good simple cutting board but not perfect,"This board is great if you have those double bowl sink. It sits on top of one and you can use the other to rinse/wash etc. that way the metal extender doesn't have to go far and the board is quite stable. If you extend the metal thing further, then you may feel the board flex when you use lot of force to chop (such as chopping off chicken parts w/ a meat cleaver).On the down side, metal extender will fall off if you extend it too far. metal parts inside the holes will rust over time.I have used this board for a many years and finally the metal extender broke. So I replaced it w/ a new board. I can live w/ its short comings. All plastic cutting boards need to be replaced every few years so this one is no exception. I like the fact that when I cut just washed veggies the water flows into the sink rather than onto the counter. As long as I have a double-bowl sink I will continue to use it."
2,Handles are worthless,Cheaply made. The handles are not anchored so they slide off way to easy. It should be adjustable with an end catch to keep the handles secure. Don't waste your money. I have 3 decent plastic cutting boards and about 3 good wooden cutting boards and I have to say the wood rules the day. If you want plastic because you think its safer and prevents bacteria you would be wrong. If you think its easier to clean you would be wrong. There's a reason why professional chefs use wood. Its superior. Anyways I thought an over the sink cutting board would at least justify using the plastic but I was wrong. Go get a good wooden cutting board and do what you need to to keep it in good condition. I will be retiring all my plastic boards at least for chopping and cutting purposes. I will likely use them as mats for other items to stand on. I so wanted to believe in the plastic boards. I was wrong!!
3,Best for smaller sinks,"Has a nice surface, but over a bigger sink the handles/support wires are a bit springy for hard service. On a regular counter it's ok, but don't think about crusing garlic when it's supported by the wire extensions. If th esurface were a bit thiker it would also help. Pretty decent for th eprice"
4,Just the Job.,"Ideal product for my useage. It arrived quickly and is perfect for what i need. The item is sturdy, although the cup holders may be a little finicky when adjusting the size."
4,Auto floor console,This Rubberqueen floor console suits my needs. The color (blue) is a good match with my car's interior. I did have to do some minor trimming for it to fit where it needed to go. I would recommend this as a good economical fit.
2,"!""##&%/(/^`? ......I DONT LIKE THIS","he's not like other rappers,he's got his own style.but this is too commercial.too much samples.did he really like the clash,or just the samples.do the movies and forget the music.but i like your name SMITH"
2,Instead of Willennium it should be Ennium.,"Leave out Will from Willennium. This ISN'T the BIG WILLIE we knew from his debut. I only like two songs on this cd so I gave it two stars, all the other songs could have been better."
4,Not as good as 'Big Willy Style',"will smiths new cd 'willenium' is certainly worth purchasing. it has some of the great dance tunes that hes famous for. it is not as good as big willie style. the beats simply arent quite as exciting. all in all though, its an excellent cd, just not spectacular"
4,Will's da Greatest,"Will is number one for hip hop sounds ever since he started out as Fresh Prince, and I'll Forever like all his songs and albums especially Wild Wild West. I'm Out"
2,"A throw back to the early days, with mixed feelings about it","ok, ok, the title, the single the whole look of the album is corny. it is throw away commercial hip pop at first glance. will smith will always be looked at as an actor instead of a rapper, but it is almost fresh to hear somebody not menttion cristal and versace or any gun talkin. this is a pary record pure and simple. it will get your toe tappin rather you like it or not. will gets some respect with his track with biz and slick rick, this has a suprisingly original sound. one other gem would have to be the rain featuring jill scott (true heads will know that jill wrote the lyrics sang by erykah badu in the roots you got me single) if you are not a true head,now you have some direction. in short this is not worth the full price of a new cd, but if you can find it used for less than three dollars, pick it up."
1,Will Smith needs to get his ego checked!,"Why does Will Smith believe himself to be so respected in hip-hop? It's not like he raps(don't get all crazy, I'm mean he doesn't make rap music), so why does he feel the need to diss a whole sub-genre of music? He doesn't cuss? Good for him, why the hell does he have to talk about it all the time? I'd have no problem with him dissing gangsta rap, IF he could bring some dope rhymes to the table. Instead he makes some dance tunes and expects everyone to love him. Like I said, the man doesn't rap, for all I know he's a white guy who just stayed out in the sun too long."
4,Refreshing as always,"It appears from the other reviewers that they are too young to remember Will Smith before he was an actor. Back then in the dark ages (what '88?) he was just the Fresh Prince. And he was a welcome refreshment compared to Eazy-E, NWA and all the other stale rap focused on sex and dope. Eleven years later, Will Smith is still a breath of fresh air in a field crowded with foul mouth fools and idiotic rappers. His music is silly, and light. ""Willennium"" is a light hearted fun party album. A great road trip selection. ""Freakin' It"" makes your toes tap no matter what your mood. ""Who am I"" is a bit off compared to the other tracks, but still a worthy song. And while WWW the movie was a poor tribute to a great show, the song does do it justice. ""The Rain"" is an obligatory WS slow song, but still quite enjoyable. Overall, while everyone else tries to remake themselves or shoot for the shock value, Smith ""keeps it real"""
4,"""I'm Coming"" is the BOMB!","I'm Coming is the bomb of this entire album. As for the rest...it's pretty catchy and worth the money, but if Will wants multi platinum selling albums he needs more songs like I'm Coming (real rap. Lose the corny 80's samples and keep it real!"
4,"Wow, Great!",This cd has both hip hop r and b and rap. It goes through all different periods in time and is Will Smith's best cd. In one word Wow!
4,This is a great cd,Wow this cd is very good. when i heard W2k it was awsome. Wow go out and buy this cd Moms out there buy this for your kids he dont curse.
1,willennium,"this album was horrible, just like his last two. weak lyric after weak lyric, i almost threw up listening. he says he doesn't have to curse to sell albums, but his music is the only stuff 10 an 11 year old kid's parents will let him listen to. it is a discrace to all the hard working rappers to call his music hip hop. i really don't like it when he try's to use ghetto slang because he always uses it out of context. i would not advise anyone who doen't like to waste money to purchase this cd, unless you want an expensive frisbee."
2,Bad!,"Will Smith has been a multi-talented artist for quite some time now. A positive role model for young folk who has also made many good decisions (and much money) along the way. But I'll stay away from this album if I were you - unless you're under 14 years of age, are into quick-buck pop music, or need a revenge gift for a lousy ex.It pains to say, but this body of ""work"", a shameless attempt to cash in on the millennium craze, really sucks. It's adding cheesy rhymes to unimaginative sampling, the combination of which has often given real hip-hop an undeserved bad rap (pardon the pun), and taking it to a newer, lower level. I like the Fresh Prince, but this, my friends ain't no ""Summertime"".I bought this CD, played it in my car and asked for my money back within 30 minutes. The Manager, in spite of the store's no-return policy, took one look at the title, took pity on me and authorized the refund.Michael Jackson once asked the question, ""Who's Bad?"" My final answer? - Look no further."
1,Willennium Bug,"Maybe there was a catastrophic occurance this new millennium:Will Smith! Just when you thought Mr. Originality (no, not Puff Daddy) was gone, boom!- there he was rappin' about how it's his year/century/millennium. This self-absorbed no talent has gone too far with his catchy/no- substance combo of music that seems to sell faster than he sells-out. Hearing today's stars puts this guy to shame. I have a good title for his next album,""Will I Ever Write An Original Song!"" Wait, he doesn't write his songs."
2,THIS CD IS SICK!,O man this cd is tight. especiall will2k. That beat will get u dancin no matter what. Go Will keep rockin the world man!
4,so fresh,"At first when i saw the video ""Will2K"" I was like "" what in the world is this? If people hate Will Smith now then they will surely still hate him!"" But after listening to the CD alot, i started to enjoy it. I play the song So Fresh all the time and the video is real good as well. The song Will2K and POTNAS are really good too. I guess I like this Cd because i'm the kind of person that likes music u can bop your head to. Sure he sampled a lot of songs but many others do it as well. I think if u want a CD that has no foul language, basically a party cd then this would be it."
3,Willennium-Could Have been better,"Will Smith is one of the best entertainers around,so I would have expected better from him. Willennium is an average cd,with a couple of standout songs,but no sure fire hits. ""Im Comin"" is probably the best song on the album. With ""Will2k"",""Wild Wild West"",and ""So fresh""(Slick Rick,Biz Markie),coming in at a not so close 2nd.""No More"",and ""Afro Angel"" are slow,and laid back,but still manage to hold thier own. There is no horrible songs on this album, but there is no great songs on this album. Buy it,if your a fan."
4,So what?,Ok Will Smith doesn't use profanity. What does that not make him special and you can't buy his cd? So are all the cool rappers that swear the one's with the big sellings. Please. Rap can be fine without swearing and trust me this cd is perfectly fine.
4,Gotta Love Will,"Let me just say that ""Freakin' It"" is such a great song! This song definitely makes the CD a must have! While Willennium may not be quite as good as Big Willie Style, I've always been a Will Smith fan, so no matter what he sings I'll listen to it! Overall, Willennium proves yet again that Will can continue to crank out hit after hit after hit!"
5,Dope cd,"This is yet another great cd from big will. I love his stuff, you can always expect a great album out of this guy because he's been in the game for so long and he knows his stuff. All you people who are sick of him bragging, just give him a break, how many people do you know have a career in acting, rapping and had their own citcom. I mean if you have acheived all he has don't you think you might show off a little? Ummm This album has a lot of great songs and unlike Big Willie Style, this is a cd that u can listen to the whole way through without one bad song while in Big Willie Style it has 4 or 5 huge hits but the whole cd can kinda get boring. Another benefit in Willenium there is just one short interlude so you don't need to listen to all that Keith B-Real nonesense. This is a great album and well worht your money. If you are a Will Smith fan like me you might also want to pick up DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Greatest Hits."
1,you call this rap?,"the only thing you can use this cd for is a frisbee. the only reason i gave this a 1 is because there is no 0! if you want to listen to some real rap, check out method man or eminem. i hate the song will2k, and to make it worse, they play it all the time on much music! in my opinion, if you are looking for a new cd, get issues by korn."
1,THE WACK RESOURE,"this is a horrible album. will smith thinks he's rap and thats sad 1.no cursing i dont think cursing makes a great song but this is my theory ""no cursing no rap"". 2. his lyrics no rapper would or never wrote about y2k will c'mon will should just admit he's 100% R&B AND 110% not rap. its a bunch of b.s. that he says he's rap with no profanity. please w.s. what the hell is that."
1,Awful,Most of the songs are ones I heard before and others are just plain awful. Will Smith seems to have stooped as low in his music career as in his horrid movies.
3,"PRETTY WACK BUT ""SO FRESH"" IS ALL THAT!","Nothing like ""Big Willie Style"" was. Big Will was slippin' on this one. His raps were once thought out and original but success has definately taken his hunger to write original material. It seems all he can talk about is his status and Jada, Jada, Jada! DO WE HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT JADA IN EVERY RAP? What happened to the skills of the Fresh Prince on the mic? Out of all the cuts on this CD, ""So Fresh is the only one worthy of any praise. But its one of Smith's best ever. It goes back to when real MC's and DJ's ripped up parties. Its definately one cut to bump in you ride! Sadly though, its not enough to make me recommend this CD to anyone. Big Will needs to shed off the Oscar nominee and Jada raps and go back to being the Fresh Prince on the mic."
4,Awsome!,"Willennium is will's best cd no question! Some of my favorites are I'm Comin`, Will 2k, Freakin` it Uuhhh, Wild Wild West and the Rain! A must buy"
4,A great album,"Will Smith, a part time actor and musician has done it again. His first album ""big willie style"" was a huge success. His songs are more of a pop/rap not the hard rap stuff. Almost every song on this cd deserves a listen. I can tell you that it may not live up to his first cd but it is still good. If u liked his last cd you'll really like this one. I love it, BUY IT."
4,Pretty good...,This has some good lyrics and a nice blend of songs. Definetely a must for a fan of Will Smith.
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was figuring that this cd would be something like ""Big Willie Style""...which I really didn't care for. But, I was pleasantly surprised! This cd is really good....lots of listenable songs like ""Wild Wild West"", ""Will2K"", and especially ""Who Am I""! Keep up the good work Will! :)"
4,Willenium,This cd rocks. Will smith the actor/musician is at his peak again releasing another great cd. I thought this was gonna be a bunch of bundled up pop/rap music that i had heard over and over again on the radio. But this cd really surprised me. It has some awesome songs on it. It's more of rap/pop/dance. So if u like that hard rap stuff i don't know if you'd like it that much but this cd is awesome and if u don't have it your missing out. To tell you the truth i don't know if i like it as much as his last one but it's still really awesome. BUY IT!
3,This ain't rap!,"This cd is o.k. It's NOT rap though. I don't say this because he doesn't cuss. All you have to do to prove it's not rap is listen to someone like Jay-Z or Dr. Dre and compare it to this. Not even close. Now to the album. As I said earlier, it's all right. The big thing that I don't like about it is that most of the songs don't really mean anything. On his last album, which I like more, there were songs like ""Just the Two of Us"" that had great meaning. I do think that this album has some really good beats. That's one of the biggest reasons that I gave it 3 stars. If you're looking for a hard core rap album, or just a regular rap album for that matter, you're going to probably be disappointed with this cd. If you just want a good dance album with nice beats though, I would buy this."
2,Not good.,"Now,i like will alot but..this cd is just not worth it. There are some good songs but most are very weak, he just aint a good rapper. Yeah...he dont have 2 swear or talk bout sex,drugs,or money thats fine but he has not got any good lyrics. He did alot better acting, please please...listen to what i say i got this cd 4 a present and im glad, cause its not worth buyin' either record it off a friend just dont get it! believe me when i say this is NOT A GOOD CD- he really has nothin worth rappin' bout'. dont waste ur money on this!"
5,Cherry2006's star aclaimed review,"This is a great CD with a great name too! I really loved this CD! It's filled with great songs! If you have any music lovers on your gift list, this is the CD for them!"
5,15 STARS!!!!!!,"Look herre. If yall don't understand this cd you shouldn' be listening to ANYTHING. Yeah, it's funny, but what you don't know is that Big Will has tricked you into buying this foolish album, hardeeharhar! You know who's really interesting though? PIRATES! Blackbeard was a good one...... good times, and happy days. Cap'n Swashbuckler is also cool, too bad he DIED. Do you know how? His brain was challenging Blackbeard's brain. Which brings us to the battle of Palm Tree Island, where Swashbuckler's brain was skewered like a delicious shishkabob on a piping hot grill. So, Swashbuckler perished infamy. THE END. P.S. His favorite letter was ""R,"" matey! Ye skallywags can walk the plank now. M'kay?"
2,Save us all,"If Will Smith is claiming that he owns the 21st century, then we are in trouble. Despite the efforts of his (much-more) talented co-stars (Eve, Lil Kim, DJ Jazzy Jeff), once Will starts ""rapping"", everything falls apart."
2,Ego problem makes it almost as bad as cursing!,"So he doesn't cuss, and I have to like that, but what is with this guy's ego problem? He's very good at coming up with the rhymes and the music will grow on you, but... ""it's not the second coming of Christ, it's the first coming of me""? That's blasphemous. If he can't find something else to rap about for the next album, he's not getting my cash."
2,"Will Smith is orright, but for only for MORMANS!","Orright, heres an ill rap artist rapping about fake BS thats around him. Will Smith is a pretty tight actor, but how he points out that he doesn't cust on his albums is pretty wack, also the themes he raps about are also wack. I guest though this is great for all the wacky Mormans who cant even watch a PG-13 movie when there 21 is ok. Yet if your a tru fan of hip-hop, go somewhere else, but tru hip-hop is underground! L8's, Props~AzN pRiDe"
2,this is terrible,"I gave it two stars because of wild wild west. If you want real rap check DMX, gospel gangstaz,and eminem out. Will smith is a wannabe rapper and it ticks me off how he tries to be ghetto! peace to all my homies"
4,More than just a CD.,"If any album ever begged to be packaged with a free Pokéman plush toy, it's Willnnium. Like his hype-fueled movie blockbusters, Will Smith's G-rated Y2K party record is more than a CD; it's a preordained event -- one that even the tykes can get jiggy with."
2,Mediocre at best,"Maybe this is the type of CD you need to get used to, but my first impression was that this was another computerized cd with Will's sometimes too self contended voice. I'm sure there's tons of teenagers purchasing this right now, but I don't really see whats so special about the cd. I am starting to doubt Will Smith's skill. I think the best thing he did was the show ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" and maybe a few standout songs (number 2) on this cd which I really don't appreciate. To tell you the truth, go buy Juvenile's Gcode if you want something worthy. Go purchase Eminems cd. Will Smith uses strange words like freaky and BS because he's too scared to utter a word of even semi-profanity; well then why doesn't he just quit. This isn't really that special unless you actually a fan of Will Smith."
4,He's at it again,"Will Smith is at it again along with the talented Jazzy Jeff. Willenium might not be as flashy as Big Willy Style, but this time, Smith shows both depth and up-tempo music. The catchy Will 2K and Wild Wild West should serve as a break from the hardcore rap of DMX and Juvenile, etc. Will Smith might not get an emmy for this one, but he will make you happy."
3,Crissy's Review,"I liked this CD, but honestly, I have heard better from him. If you are a big Will fan, you will love it. I could only find a few songs I liked."
4,As good as the first time I saw it.,"The acting is superb, and the romance is heartwarming. The music is a welcome return to a more peaceful era."
5,great,"movie was in excellent condition, enjoyed it very much. wanted my grandson to watch and he was inpressed by the music."
3,Passable,"As a clarinet player, I like Benny Goodman's playing. But the movie is boring. First, Steve Allen gives a wooden performance. He's not convincing at all. Second, Donna Reed is a good actress but works with a poor script. Just because Benny plays Mozart's Clarinet Concerto she falls in love with him? I wish they'd spent more time on Benny's best bands, than Benny's mother trying to play match maker. In those days acting was usually lousy, and it shows in this movie. In summary, there's such a big difference between Reed's acting and Steve Allen's stiffness, it's painful to watch. Benny himself didn't like the movie."
1,Compatibility,"This DVD is set for region 1, my new Philips DVD player is set for region 2 (Europe , UK ) only. That restriction wasnt mentioned in the DVD offer."
4,Captivating Movie,"Although in general, Jazz is one of my most unfavourite types of music, I was captivated by the story. I couldn't get up once I had started watching it. Donna Reed and Steve Allen really brought the story (partly fictional by the way) of Benny Goodman out and intrigued me enough to want to learn more about his life and the sort of music he played. The musical numbers in the film are among Goodman's best, and really liven the film up. A great film."
5,must have collection,"i've decided to buy this dvd for my dad(70yro) for father's day, and i thought maybe i should get it for my collection.i am 32 years old and i am the member of big band. i play alto and tenor saxophone. our band play his music all the time and i thought it will be nice to know the history. guess what! i loved it! i watched 3 times none stop! if you like big band and if you are a fan of benny goodman, it's must have collection. i agree with quality of dvd being not as good as nowadays, but what do you expect? it was made long time ago. that's what make this Classical movies so special. i love it"
3,Not bad if you ignore the silly elements.,"It seems clear that the real BG is not to be found in this movie. The factual distortions are pretty extreme, even by Hollywood biopic standards. For more on the real Benny (gifted; demanding; egocentric; alternately generous and selfish; etc.), the biography ""Swing, Swing, Swing"" by Ross Firestone is a very good read.Still, if not taken too seriously (and how can you take seriously a movie in which various characters keep saying ""Benny, don't be that way!""?), this movie is pretty entertaining and the music (while a pale imitation of that from his glory years) is worth listening to."
3,Thanks for the Music,"The value of this film lies not in the story but the music. The story is filled with flaws including the Carnegie Hall concert. However, there are some versions of the musical material on the soundtrack that surpasses many of the studio recorded versions available today. ""One O'Clock Jump, Stompin' at the Savoy,"" and ""Bugle Call Rag"" are three that come to mind. This is where the film shines, in the musical presentation.As one of the other reviewers stated, if you want to learn about the life of Benny Goodman, get a copy of ""Swing, Swing, Swing: The Life and Times of Benny Goodman."" Next get a copy of the Carnegie Hall concert and listen. The recording is noisy, but the music is amazing. Furthermore, this event elevated Jazz from popular music to an artform. 1 star for the acting and 5 stars for the music."
4,He can't help the way he is--and aren't we glad?,"I understand the history in this story isn't precisely correct, but oh-my-god the music! Steve Allen, who made his film debut here, is only playing along with Goodman's original recordings, but he still gives an intensity and modesty to the role.And again, the music. You've got a lot of the greats, including Gene Krupa, Stan Getz, and Harry James playing themselves. The film's a treat to watch, but worth buying to listen to over and over again.Rebecca Kyle, March 2009"
3,Benny Goodman bio worth it for the music,"Not much for historical accuracy, but the music is great -- especially since some of the real people were still around in '56 when it was made. E.G. Harry James, Lionel Hampton, Teddy Wilson, Gene Krupa, Ziggy Elman, Martha Tilton, etc."
5,The Benny Goodman Story,"This is the most enjoyable movie you can get, at this price. It is a good deal because all the qualities fit for a higher price dvd.The video and audio are superb.For the Benny Goodman'fans, The songs are really played by his band. I enjoyed every minute.The Benny Goodman and his band playing in the Carnegie Hall is incomparable. You will always played it again and again to remind yourself of the time that America once had this kind of music and these kind of people."

Furthermore, this event elevated Jazz from popular music to an artform. 1 star for the acting and 5 stars for the music."
1,Not THE Firefall,This is not the country rock band version of Firefall but a pop band. Rick Roberts and Larry Burnett were the creative forces in the original lineup. Larry is not on this album and Rick provides backup vocals. Disposable pop music. Not worth buying.
3,"good music, but not Firefall","If I had heard this disc under some other group name, I would thought it was well done and a sound that I quite like. Under the Firefall moniker however, it was a little disappointing.Had I not seen the cover, I might have guessed that Steve Perry was now the lead singer for the Little River Band. Not a terrible concept, but not what I was expecting."
4,Luther Vandross: Greatest Hits,"The bad news is that we no longer have the opportunity to hear Luther in the flesh; we do however have his greatest hits snuggly packed in one CD. 14 songs are included in this album, like ""Hear And Now,"" and ""A House Is Not A Home"" with a little help provided by Gregory Hines and Dionne Warwick. If you want the one CD that has all the charm and character offered by the late great Luther Vandross, this is it."
5,LUTHER VANDROSS GREATEST HITS,The CD arrived with minor scratches on front and back. The music is what you would expect from such a gifted singer and Luther is and was just that.
3,Lacking some major hits,"Any greatest hits album is destined to be lacking a few hits. There's no way to select every song that anyone ever loved. But this one is lacking a few major hits. ""If Only For One Night,"" ""Love Won't Let Me Wait,"" ""If This World Were Mine,"" and ""Anyone Who Had A Heart"" are all absent from this collection. I've yet to find a collection of Luther's music that includes all of his truly ""great"" songs, so I've decided to make my own. I'd suggest that people interested in a complete collection of hits (who don't want to have to buy 3 or 4 CDs) do the same."
5,Words can't describe the voice.,"His voice was magical and the music brilliant. He will be so sorely missed. This album is fantastic for people who aren't so familiar with his music because there is a big scope of his recordings here. His voice is unlike anyone else's and there will never be another artist ever like Luther. I am so sorry that we will never hear new music from him again, but at least his voice goes on in these great albums."
3,A Voice Worth Singing About,"Luther Vandross is one of the few soul singers that really knows how to wow the ladies. His 1999 Greatest Hits Album, displays his natural talent with every way his music goes.Although it remains as a combination of his previous greatest hits albums, Best Of Volumes 1 & 2, the album still proves that he can pack a punch. The songs that are highlighted range from standards like Power Of Love / Love Power & Here And Now, to his dynamic duets with Dionne Warwick (How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye) and Gregory Hines (There's Nothing Better Than Love).While many radio stations still prefer Teen Idols and Rap music, it is nice to hear a seductive escape from the Top 40 mayhem. With that thought in mind, Luther Vandross remains as one of those few artists worth escaping to."
5,Damaged Product,"Luther Vandross is one of my favorite artists off all times. When I received my greatest hits collection cd in the mail I first observed that the plastic cd case had 3 cracks on it. I did not think too much of that, however, after playing the cd for the 1st time, songs 4-7 all skipped.I have been very busy with work and did not have time to send back the cd in a timely fashion. I went on-line and learned that I only had 30 days to return the item. This was a defective item and was not damaged by myself in anyway.Needless to say I had to order another cd and pay the charges again. Unhappy customer......"
3,A Nice Collection,"Luther Vandross' ""Luther Vandross: Greatest Hits"" is a good album filled with many of the Luther's best songs. The songs talk about love, loss, desire, and sensuality. Luther Vandross' voice is so velvety smooth that you instantly become engrossed in the songs.Of course there are some songs that could have been left off of this CD, and others that should have been added, but overall, this is a pretty good CD, especially for a Luther fan. I would suggest this CD to fan of Luther as well as people who want to hear good music by one of the greatest singers of our time."
3,"A great singer, some great songs, but spotty production","Luther Vandross is such a great singer. His vocal talents are undeniable. There are many nice moments on this record, including his treatment of the songs ""Never Too Much,"" ""Superstar/Until You Come Back to Me"" and especially ""A House is Not a Home."" You listen, and you are in awe of the guy's vocal talent.My only quibble is with the syrupy slick production on a number of the tracks."
4,Some really great advice,"I really enjoyed this book a lot. I couldn't put it down until I finished it...in about 4 hours! I found the information about the First wife not getting the ""REAL"" divorce to totally (and finally) help me pinpoint what was the psycho-ex-wife-from-HEll's problem! Great information for us Step mothers. HOWEVER, it did not cover enough information for those of us that have custody of our step kids. It assumed a little too much that 95% of all mother's have custody of our kids (okay, that's actually right, since I do have custody of my son from my first marraige). But I didn't like how there was just so little information about father's having custody. Overall, I really enjoyed the information that I did get out of this book and it really related well to my situation."
4,The end of the world,"this book had it`s good parts and it`s bad. It started out slowand spead up.like in the 1234 chapters it was so slow I was about bto stop reading, but then it started to get good slowly then bam! There was one of the main points. That happened through out the book.It was an awsome book.It had some awsome scenes. My favorite was when Lewis got the heck scared out of him by that Japenese Siren. It was Funny and scary all in one. But that was only one good part.I liked the character and the settings. The main character was unusal,a fat bookworm. Then there are the setting.An island in the middle of the great lakes, not a likly place were earthly desrtuction would come from."
3,Meh,"Cheap foam is not comfortable. Sound quality is pretty good, but certainly not the best in its price range."
4,Worth the money. Perfect with electric guitar or drums.,"It's probably not a good idea to use it with your laptop or computer cause you need an adaptor, and it is still too tight(for a normal head shape) after 6 months. It is too big so don't even think about killing time in a long trip with your mp3 device and this thing.Sound was great. I have always trusted Grado and AKG in sound quality and this product proved that. Best with rock or folk music.If you play electric music instruments and want to keep the voice to yourself, consider SR125 or SR80."
4,beats out way more expensive cans,"After breaking these headphones in there is a marked improvement in the quality of the sound, and they do take very well to a headphone amp. Compared to my Denon ah-d5000's, they are so much more clear and detailed. They're true beauty comes out when you use these with high quality audio (cd's, vinyls, and WAV files)."
4,good sounding not very comfortable,"These sound good and are fairly comfortable for a short listen. I have never been able to make them as comfortable as the AKGs that I replaced with them. They have a smooth, detailed, sound, but be prepared to fiddle around with the fit."
4,not for protruding ears,"We've owned these headphones for a few years. I'm not an audiophile but appreciate great hi-fi sound. The sound is fantastic on these. I won't be able to expand futher on the reviews here. However, both my son and I use these and we both have ears that stick out though I wouldn't say it is severe. We find these headphones painful after about 20-30 minutes. Its obviously bothersome enough for us that I am now looking for a more comfortable pair. The pain is more noticeable lately and I'm wondering if the foam pieces are breaking down although visually they look fine."
5,Wish I didn't live in NYC,"The sound is outstanding with this well-made headphones. I usually listen to Jazz and some alternatives. While listening to Jazz, it sounds like each instrument singing a song. The balance between low, mid, and high is just perfect. I spent thousands of money to find out which set of headphones satisfies my ears. For alternatives, you might need to adjust the sounds through EQ since this set of headphones focuses on the sounds of mid to high ranges. I don't listen to Hip-Hop at all, but I can imagine this set won't meet the needs of Hip-Hop listener.I live in NYC and love to listen to music while commuting to my work place. However, this headphones doesn't have noise cancellation or wasn't made for outing. This was the only negative opinion about this set. I wish I didn't live in NYC..."
5,These cans are absolutely amazing!,"You just can't compare them to anything else in this price range, I have listened to headphones upwards of $600 that don't compare in sound depth and overall sound quality. If you put these headphones on after you're current pair same song same volume, it will sound like someone just took there hands off your ears. Especially if you are a fan of jazz, classical, rock, reggae, opera, but even Hip Hop sounds amazing on these cans. But don't take my word for it listen for your self.The only complaint I have is comfort it's not that bad though. It is defiantly tolerable for 2+ hrs of non stop listing."
4,"Very nice sound, very good customer service","I have had these headphones for several years now and have been very happy with the sound quality. It really is remarkable to listen to a piece of music with quality headphones like these after using something like the standard issue ones that come with an iPod. I heard sounds that were previously absent.A few other things to mention - these are ""open"" headphones and they do not block outside noise or contain the music you are listening to. They are not made for noisy environments like a subway car, or quiet environments with other people such as a library.Secondly, I am careful with my headphones, nevertheless the pair I had did break once: one headphone just stopped working. In this respect, Grado was very helpful. They repaired the headphone quickly and it has been fine ever since."
3,ODI Rogue Grips,"These are great grips and would give them 5 stars, but when I purchased these it only came with the grips. You need to buy the lock jaws for these to work if you dont already have them. They really need to change the picture and the title to replacement grips only. Was wondering why they were alot cheaper than others. The lock jaws will cost you an additional $14 or so. Therefore, probably just cheaper to find a combo deal, than to buy them seperately."
4,Christmas Present for 21mo. old,"I purchased this for my son (21 mo.) and nephew (15 mo.). My son loves it. I think it is a good toy for cause and effect. You have to press the head down to make it run. Only downside is the batteries did not last long in it. My nephew 15 mo. was not into it as much, mainly because it is harder for such a young one to keep up with it as a child who can move faster."
3,"ok, but not so much fun","For a one year old, you have to press hard to make the car go forward. My 2 yr old presses but since the car goes very slow so not much fun for him. I like shake cars which are easier to start by any child."
4,Shorts!,"This is a nice collection of short films. If you like shorts, you will like this set. Award nominated films"
2,"Not a bad story, but not much about the Bassett","Because I loved the original ""Voyage of the Bassett"" so much, I was happy to find this series. This story was interesting, about 3 very different boys from San Francisco who find themselves on the Bassett after a tumble into the Bay. However, the Bassett plays a very small part in the story, only providing transportation for the boys to Asgard, where they have an adventure with the Norse gods. If you're really looking for more adventures on board the Bassett, give this one a pass."
2,Been there,"Definitely a ""small screen "" movie (ie Kindle), but not a waste of time. Think most people can identify with how achingly skewed is love, as well as how lopsided freindships can be."
4,Story telling set to music,I always loved The Band and had all of their albums and video. I had to get some of their cd's and wasn't dissapointed. Very creative music.
1,Recon Products,"This is the 2nd set of Recon lights I have purchased, first set was a set of cab lights that constantly had condensation in them. Several calls to Recon about this were no good as they only suggested resealing them which I did. Did not help. This set of dually fender lights are only 6 weeks old and 3 out of 4 are filled with condensation. I called and left a message with Recon and emailed them and no response from Recon."
4,Have not finished the book.,The part of the book that I have read is well written. This is the type of book that is difficult to put down
5,Mystery/War story,"Well written and captivating story about a corner of the war often neglected, the Nazi occupation of the Isle of Man. Perhaps a little simple in its resolution, but a quick and interesting read nonetheless."
5,Very good historical fiction.,"It is a great historical based mystery, rich in character studies. It ties past and present together quite well. It was a good twin to the Eagle Has Landed."
4,Worthwhile read,Excellent story. Good character development. Interesting and thrilling plot. I would recommend this book as an easy and interesting read.
3,Action,"Love Jack Higgins, one of his better stories, more of a thriller because it has some history behind it. I am familiar with the story of the Channel Islands during WWII and this fills in some adventure for me. The occupation was not quite as dramatic,but this brings it to life.."
3,This is Worthwhile,"I'm a Jack Higgins fan. This isn't as thrilling as most of his thrillers, but even on an off day, he's good. It's a fast read, great for reading addicts. I like books about the Channel Islands, too; and Higgins did another one I read some years back that wasn't as good as this. Cheapness recommends it, too. You can do a lot worse than this one."
1,Night of the ox,"Did not finish, it was to slow and I could not get into it. what can I say when no is no"
2,waste of time,this book had a good story to start. it got worse after that.not very believable and a stupid ending. a waste of my time.
4,"a great, quick read -a travel book for sure","This is a typical Higgins book. It is fast moving, historically interesting, and quick to read. I always enjoy his WW II era novels. This is a great book to take to the beach, on a cruise, or to the fireplace on a cold winter weekend."
3,JACK HIGGENS,"HAVE NOT READ JACK HIGGENS FOR A LONG TIME, HOWEVER, THIS BOOK STILL RPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE BRIT THRILLER WRITERS.ENJOYABLE READ."
5,Long time fan,"Glad I bought this book have not read his work for a while and glad I picked this one, Hope you enjoy it too!"
3,It's okay,I was disappointed in the story as a whole...I thought it was historical..not fiction. But not a bad read ... just not what I expected
4,A quick read,Jack Higgins tells a fascinating story about WWII that few people know anything about. I didn't know the Jersey island was occupied during the war. The story relies on some factual history with plenty of filler. The characters are real and the aciton continuous. It's an enjoyable read.
3,Good book,I found this a good book but in parts a little predictable. It was definitely worth its purchase price. I did really like the mixture of true history and fiction.
3,Improbable Entertainment,"Leave it to Mr. Higgins to take a true piece of history, imagine a healthy fiction as part of it, add colorful (yet improbable) characters, and you are off on an entertaining romp. The most far-fetched but fun characters are the German Jew entertainer turned soldier who uses his acting skills to take on the role of Erwin Rommel, the Italian Count who is an impressive Naval man, and the Finnish fighter ace. All are thrust into a milieu that began with the rescue of an American Colonel who knows too much about the Allies invasion of Europe. The romance and dialogue grows stilted, the action not as thrilling as many of Higgins' efforts, yet, it still makes the time pass in a pleasing way."
3,Not quite enough,"This was the first Jack Higgins book that I've read, and likely not my last. This book was easy to read and the action was consistent throughout.I do think Higgins could have done more to develop his characters. I don't feel that I really got to know the book's most exciting character, Harry Martineau."
2,Mildly Entertaining,"A wildly improbable basic plot--rescuing an American colonel who knows the location and timing of the D-Day landings--on which is constructed an even more improbable one: An impersonator of Rommel who's actually Jewish. Oy, gevalt. There are some good things here--you will probably care about some of the characters, even if they are gauzy-thin. A book for a plane ride or a weekend in some place where there's not much to do."
4,"Exciting, Excellent","Great story set in fascinating WWII context. Surprised that it has not been made into movie. Would be like ""Eye of the Needle"" also a Higgins tale. Fun read for any WWII history buff."
4,This story is delightful!,"I raved about NIGHT OF THE FOX so much that my husband, who has always been opposed to reading anything on Kindle, is now reading it - on my Kindle! At the end of every reading session, when he puts the Kindle down, he says the same thing I said when I was reading it: ""That's a good book.""It is based enough on facts - we're in our 80s, thus experienced WW II first hand - to make the story real, yet I found myself fully caught up in the fiction. During the climactic chapter, I laughed out loud. And of course rooted for the Good Guys all the way through."
3,Night of the Fox,This was better than Sky Stone. I personally will not order any more Sky Stone stories! But did like Jack Higgins.Nanci Hill
4,they seem to have made a movie of this,"I didn't know about the movie when I got this used:Night of the Fox.The German E-boats were also new to me.But I had seen a fictionalization of Rommel's double,I just didn't realize that it was this film.Toward the end of WWII the German generals realized Hitler was leading them to a crushing defeatand planted a bomb unsuccessfully.Leading that plot was the desert fox Rommel.This book takes place on the captured island of Jersey.One always wonders why instead of attacking Russian Hitler didn't invadeEngland when he had the chance?The answer is that the British Navy actually ruled the channelwell enough that Germany couldn't launch an invasion.The E-boats ( very like American PT boats) and the U-boatswere the only advantage the Germans had at sea.I liked this novel about spies on the island of Jersey on a secret mission, but is just a myth type of story."
1,UNIMPRESSED,"I HAVE READ OTHER JACK HIGGINS BOOKS AND FOUND THIS ONE DIFFICULT TO GET INTO; THEREFORE, I AM DELETING IT FROM MY LIST OF TBR."
4,Good plot-weak ending,Cleverly written plot that is very readable. Historically correct with literate liberties taken. Ending is poor after a fast paced and enjoyable venture.
2,I have to guess that Jack is no longer with us.,Mundane plot--mundane charcters. That is why it is a cheap book. If you are a big time reader--do not bother!
4,If you insist,good read! instant download! what more could you want from a kindle book. reasonable price. would read more from this author
4,Lots of historical references,The characters are real enough to make one wonder if you could have been so courageous to do the things that needed to be done during war. Good read.
2,Disappointed in the story being so short,Did not realize this was such a short story. Was disappointed with the length!!!!Will be more diligent in reading to be sure it is a full length novel
4,A Conte evolution,"This is a great CD if you are exploring Conte for the first time. He's been through a lot of changes and this represents them pretty well. You also get a lyric booklet. However, nothing is translated into English which continues to be a problem in all things Conte. The good news is that it leaves you free to make the songs about whatever your would like."
2,Poor craftsmanship,"I've had this product for 5 years of light usage, but by the 3rd year I started having problems.Inserting the key into the lock and properly turning it does not always turn the lock to ""lock"" into my computer. Similarly, turning the key does not always ""unlock"" the lock, leaving me unable to remove the lock from my computer.I have to fiddle with the lock for literally 5-10 mins, jiggling the key and twisting and turning the thing to try to get the key to perform its function.I do not recommend this lock. This issue has degraded to such a point that I am shopping for a new lock now."
4,"Good product, just a little expensive","Overall the best laptop lock out there with a REAL KEY (I just don't like those cheap round key thingies).I have several Kensington locks, and can recommend this as a high quality product.It is sturdy and the rubber ring facing the computer does a good job in keeping my Macbook Pro from being scratched.The only objection I have is that it is maybe 10$ too expensive."
4,the only lock for a mac,I have had trouble in the past with cheap combination or key locks fitting my Mac or offering adequate security. This lock offers both!
3,Pretty useless on a MacBook,"The lock itself is sound (I suppose). But I just want to let all the users of the popular MacBook (obviously myself included) not to waste their money on this one. The soft matte plastic of the black macbook around the kensington lock hole does hold up to the force required to engage and disengage this lock. After just two gentle lock and unlock motions with the hole for this thing on the side of my MacBook is disfigured and about double it's original size. I can easily see that if I used this thing daily to lock my MacBook to my desk (like I was intending to do) I'd soon have huge hole in the side of my notebook and a useless lock. Apple and Kensington what were you thinking? Thanks Kensington for ripping an eyesore into the side of beautiful black MacBook! Fortunately, if my rebate goes through I'll get half my money back."
2,DOA.,I recently received this product and it was broken out of the box. The locking mechanism had faulty bearings which made it impossible to open/close. Aside from that the cable was heavy duty and well crafted. A little bit heavier than what I want to add to my already overloaded backpack.
4,"Pretty good, does the trick.","Works pretty well; at first, I didn't really know how to use it so I had to get the hang of lining up the little nubs that go into the kensington lock slot on my computer. Now it's pretty easy. It seems to be fine for what it is...a theft deterrent. No complaints."
1,My Microsaver DS got unlocked...,"Well, I had used this Microsaver DS since I purchased it from Amazon in Sep., 2007.A week ago, while my laptop was locked to a chair in LeXXXX library, somebody unlocked it and left with my laptop. When this theft incident happened, I was in the bathroom (for 2 or 3 mins). I depended very much on this product, but it happened. I lost everything...I contacted Kensington, but I can't get much help from them even though its 1-yr warranty (theft coverage) was already expired.I'd like to remind you that somebody can unlock it if he/she has to."
4,Solid lock,"I ordered this to keep my Del Latitude safe while we traveled in Italy for 2 weeks. The lock is easy to use and very solid, although it added a bit more weight to my luggage than I would have liked. Cable is very thick...good item to keep people honest."
2,Lock mechanism turns with key,"The lock mechanism keeps turning with the key, unless you hold a certain part of the lock while you turn the key. Also, the key does not always insert properly, if the lock mechanism was turned with the key."
2,"difficult to operate, but works with MacBook Pro","To lock, just attach and turn the key, right? Not with this lock. It turns out there's a trick: you have to push in and turn the ""T-bar"" first so that the rod is lined up straight between the two prongs -- it can't be perpendicular or it won't work. So if you want to keep the key on your key ring, you'll have to deal with lining up the T-bar every time you insert the lock. (If you have the key loose, you won't have to remove it after you remove the lock from the laptop, and then the T-bar stays in position.) The ""manual"" covers none of this.Before I learned how to use the lock, I called Kensington and the representative said the MacBook Pro doesn't have a K symbol, so their locks won't work with it. That turns out not to be true. I went to a Mac store, and they use this lock with the MacBook Pro. So do I."
2,APPLE SHOULD THINK ABOUT CREATING A SAFETY DEVICE THAT DON'T DESTROYS THEIR LAPTOPS,"When I was looking for a device that could protect or deter a looter from taking my laptop, I never imagine that this particular piece would end up damaging my computer. First of all it is a pain in the neck to get that thing to work easily and then when you really get to make it work it ends up damaging the side of your computer, making a big scratch and if someone wants to take your laptop and finds this device attached to it, it only takes for that person to pull it really violently to probably destroy your valuable computer, I now it's hard to think about leaving your computer someplace without any antitheft device, but think twice about how to protect your laptop before buying one of these products.I have a Powerbook G4, and that was my experience I don't know how it works on other brands or models."
2,Not the same anymore...,"This is the second Kensington notebook lock I've owned. I left the first one behind at a hotel. Unfortunately, they don't make things like they used to anymore. The first one had distinct features on the lock and key, making it pretty unique and probably harder to remove by someone without a key. This one had a came with a pretty generic key, like a skeleton key. It's so plain looking, I'm led to believe that every lock has the same exeact key. So chances are if someone got ahold of one of these keys, they can unlock just about every one of these locks from Kensington."
4,Good lock but also scratched my Macbook Pro,This is rated to be the most secure notebook lock in Kensington's catalogue so I bought it. I ignore the previous reviewer's comment that it scratched his Macbook Pro and I also ended up dinging it a bit as well.Now I decided to avoid further damage my Macbook Pro by placing a small piece of transparent tape on the area where the lock connects with the laptop and poking a hole to accommodate the male lock connector.I know it is a cheap solution but it does work and no one's the wiser.
3,"Works as adverstised, feels a little bit cheap.","Have been using it since August (about 6 months) and it works pretty well.PROS: very secure, works pretty well, has a nice rubber gasket that keeps the laptop from getting scuffed.CONS: gasket comes off occasionally, lock seems to jam occasionally.OVERALL: worth the money.FINAL VERDICT: would recommend againREASON FOR PURCHASE: Highest security out of all the locks I could find.I bought it because there were a lot of web articles out there about how easy it was to pick BOTH:1. Combination Locks; AND2. ""Circle Key"" Locks (they kind that the key looks like a tube and the lock fits to match the key.)Both of these are apparently very easy to pick (go on to YouTube, you'll see what I mean) so I went with the most secure one I could find, and that was this. It is one of the few laptop locks with a real, cut key that locks and unlocks."
1,Worst product. hopefully this video shows that how hard it is to unlock your computer,"Locking is finebut unlocking is painfulIt is not like me using the computer lock for the first timeI always borrow one in the library and use it to lock my laptop.but with this model, pulling it out of my computer is painfulI just spent 50 minutes trying to unlock this thing out of my computerIt almost damaged my computerI am not daring to do it again"
4,Good,"I've been using this for almost a year or so, works good. The rubber rim comes off as my went is right next to the lock, so the glue gave up. Otherwise it looks secure (I haven't tried to yank on it or anything), makes me feel better. The key sometimes doesn't go all the way, but you just have to use it correctly. I will probably buy more for other stuff that I have."
4,Decent lock,When using the lock for the first time I found it to be very confusing/frustrating and the instructions that came with it were lacking. I also am not sure how difficult it would be to cut the chain or pull the lock off so I view this as a deterrent.
3,Cute color,"I chose this one because the red matched my notebook. I like how this lock had some color to it.& because I herd combos and tubular locks were easy to hack into.I've never owned a laptop lock before, but this one looks and feels high quality. It was, however, extremely flimsy on my toshiba netbook. It fit more snuggly on my mom's sony vaio, although it still wobbles a bit.Key part kind of scared me at first for a brief moment, but then I figured out how to use it. You have to make sure you push it in ALL the way (you'll hear a click short of) to unlock it. But don't worry, it seems legit and won't break or get stuck.Cable is long and strong.It is a high quality lock, but I think it would fit more better on certain laptops than others, but in my situation it didn't fit my toshiba too well. So overall I'd give it a 3 stars."
3,Decent security for MacBook Pro,"Using this laptop security cable with a 17"" MacBook Pro (older style, not unibody construction) and am pretty happy with it. Installs and uninstalls pretty quickly. Getting the key to work in the lock seems a bit fiddly (e.g., press and turn, etc.) but it works and seems very secure.I especially like the little plastic clip that is attached to the cable that holds the coiled cable for storage. It helps keep the cable neat and tidy in your bag. Small, inexpensive feature, but very useful."
1,Does not fit slot,"This lock does not fit unibody Macbooks, nor is it possible to make it fit without removing the rubber scratch protector from the lock. How expensive can it possibly be to produce a slightly thinner rubber ring? I would even buy it separately, if Kensington would just offer it for sale. Very disappointing."
4,Cheese gets better with age!,"It is cheesy, it is campy, and it's about as goofy as goofy can get. Lawrence and Lawrencine Collins were an amazingly twisted teenage rockabilly duo from the early 60s who put out one of the coolest party records of all time. Imagine the Mousketeers speedballing at a county fair in matching fringed shirts. Nobody but the Collins Kids put out records so heavy on the Carl Perkins-style guitar riffs and loaded with great lines like ""Everybody come and taste the possum that I shot--let's have a party!"". You'll laugh; you'll be embarrassed; you'll love it."
4,Body MRI,Body MRI is definitely a good start for radiology residents. Each chapter starts with relevant MRI physics. The most important information are summarised in boxes for almost all entities which is a bonus for rapid reviewing. Many images with nice descriptions.Still not complete. I do not recommend it for fellows.
1,Call of the Wild,This was not the movie advertised on the front of the case. It was instead a Brian Keith movie. My dad was very disappointed because this was a Father's Day gift from me to him. I felt like this was some pirated thing I purchased instead of a legitimate copy of the movie.
2,"Slow, dry book with misleading cover","After reading a few chapters, I found this book hard to want to read. Pinder's style is dry and slow, and leaves plenty to be desired. The stories he tells are rather uneventful, though I usually enjoy writings about simple events, but only when written well. The cover might lead a potential reader to believe Pinder will criticize yuppy hikers and the flocks of roof-racked Subaru driving granolas that fill the parking lots at his beloved trailheads. Pinder does not, however. He spends a fair amount of time talking with and about the thru-hikers he meets on the trail. I do believe there are better books to buy, and if one if interested in having the most ""genuine experience"" while out of doors, read some Thoreau."
1,Test Yourself A+ ??,"I have never returned a book - until now. I returned both the soft cover and the text book. The number of errors was disgusting, considering those with no prior computer background are counting on this book to give them the information they need to pass the test! The text was bad enough, but the soft cover had answers that conflicted with the text, and the text's free software to help you test yourself was also full of bugs. Pass this one by - try the Sybex A+ Complete. I received a score of over 90% using only this book. Good luck."
1,I want my money back,"Recently took the 2001 objectives. Passed the OS in May 2001 with an 840 and the HW 3 weeks earlier with a 878. These questions were the least like the ones I had on my tests. Save your money. If you're only going to buy one book (and you shouldn't) Buy the Mike Meyers book. If you're seriously going to pursue this certification, lurk in the alt.certification.a-plus newsgroup for a while. Good luck!"
1,What a pile of...,"I recently brought this book and I to will return it, it is the single most useless use of paper I have ever seen, a lot of the questions are badly worded and their ""answers"" are inconsistency with the preceding text. This book is hazardous in the hands of a beginner. I hope the publisher reads these responses and amends any future releases."
2,A much better book is Learning How to Play the Flute.,"I bought this along with a book called Learning How to Play the Flute, which I like much better. The Hal Leonard book has fewer songs to play. I just watched the DVD and it's quite funny! Very dated and not helpful. The instructor onscreen just goes into too much picky detail and breezes through the notes too quickly. There's no way you could learn how to play the flute just by watching the DVD! You really need to practice from a book. There is also a CD but I haven't played along to it yet."
5,Compresive Learning System,This product is awesome. It comes with a very up to date DVD that gives you visual instructions. Highly recommended
4,Very nice Audio + Method,"Hi Folks,The Audio CD and the book is a good combination for beginners. You can easily play and learn the notes.The only thing is the embouchure. It's hard to make it and the DVD does not help as much as I thought it would help. Anyway... you can find your way practicing and searching videos on the net if necessary. This set is a must have for begginers for sure!Enjoy!Ron"
5,Outstanding Product,"I bought a Neuton mower in 2003. At that time I had a small yard for which the mower was well-suited. In 2005 I moved to a house with a yard requiring a riding mower. However, I still find the Neuton very useful for places where the riding mower is not suitable. The Neuton is a mower I would highly recommend. It has performed up to and beyond expectations. In 2005 I bought the trimmer/edger attachment and have found it to be superb. I have had no problems with the mower or the attachments."
5,"Perfect for smaller lawn, but a lil' over its head for bigger ones...","This is my 3rd season using the Neuton. It delivers everything as it's supposed to. But let's be realistic, it mows only 14"" in width. So if you have a big lawn, don't get this, get the newer Neuton with a mowing width of 19"" instead. Other than that, it's a very well made machine & it's US-made! How rare do we encounter US-made products these days huh? Now, grab a 14"" ruler & try to visualize if this is even practical for your size lawn. If in doubt, it's probably too small for you. Battery life is over 1-hr for me which is amazing."
1,"Great little mower, until you need a battery","We have a very small lawn, so this mower seemed perfect. In the 6 years we have been using it we have been very happy. Unfortunately, the battery died at the start of summer.Imagine my surprise when I tried to order a new one and found out there is a ""3 to 4 week"" wait until they send it. You cannot get this battery anywhere else. I ordered it on June 9th, they shipped it on July 16th and it arrived on July 20. Over 6 weeks! I had to rent a mower to do my lawn during the down time.I would never buy another mower from this company with such poor service."
1,Neuton Lawn Mower Battery Problems,"I currently have a dead and useless Neuton electric mower in the garage and a recently purchased a gas mower. I hate hate hate to use a gas mower, but the Neuton was so frequently unreliable that I was forced into it...largely this is due to the poor life of the battery.Their battery requires a 24 hour charge, but If I forgot to unplug it after 24 hours exactly, the battery was rendered useless. I replaced it twice and finally gave in and got the gas mower since I don't have the memory or time in the day to baby a battery. Their customer service actually said ""only a dummy couldn't unplug the mower after 24 hours"".Hopefully this new niCad battery technology will enter the mower market and make a mower with a more reliable and foolproof battery."
2,Dead Battery= expensive junk.,I would verbatim repeat what the other reviewer said about the battery. That is pretty much my experience. 2 dead batteries in a row and then a gas mower to replace this useless machine.
4,A must for African enthusiasts!,The eloquence of Stanley's writing is a pleasure. His assessment and interest towards the African is compassionate. His record of the ancestral history of the Uganda region is undoutably the first written account. A truly 'good read' offering much enlightenment of the Lake Victoria area and the conditions of exploration in 1875.
1,Propaganda by the author of an African holocaust,"As noted already by another reviewer, if you do read this book, please read ""King Leopold's Ghost"" by Hochschild. The latter is a wonderfully written account of a nightmare society that was built with Stanley's willing cooperation (Stanleyville was named after him). Moreover Hochschild's account is the result of years of research in libraries to reconstruct a history that King Leopold, Stanley's backer, sought hard to obliterate. When you read headlines today about atrocities in the Congo today, be aware that Stanley is very directly responsible for what has happened. To give you an insight into the man, his contemporaries report that he enjoyed shooting Africans for sport. Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" is based on his own first-hand experiences in the Congolese slave society that Stanley helped to build. Too many good people sacrificed lives and careers to bring this to light, for people to now ignore the truth."
1,A Great Lie,"Lies, Lies, Lies.....if you wanna know what i am talking about read (King Leopold's Ghost by Hochschild)"
3,"Original, not pristine!","This cd has a great selection, but some listeners might not appreciate the mono, and the considerable surface noise on some tracks.The recordings date from the early 1950s (accounting for the mono), and all seem to be just past the 50 year zone that places them in Public Domain in Europe.It would be nice to hear the same slection mastered from better sources.But it's nice to hear the original Quiet Village :)"
1,no good,"Cool mist humidifier is a good size, but the noise is too much. The switch is very loose, and the humidifier is too loud to leave on at night. Don't count on this. I had to return it to Target the next day."
2,"Works, but too noisy","This product has two problems. First, it's too noisy on either the low or high setting. Think loud air conditioner. It's not something you can sleep with. However if you need a ""white noise"" generator to blot out sounds from other rooms, this is the perfect device.The other problem is that the water tank isn't designed to stand by itself upside down while you try to refill it. I couldn't even get it to lean against something; it kept falling over. You have to be holding it with one hand and preferably two hands. The easiest thing is to have someone else hold it for you. This is a stupid design. They sacrificed convenience for a nifty looking but uselessly curved shape.Don't waste your money."
1,Bad Product - don't buy,"This humidifier does not work! Instead of relieving cold symptoms (i.e. dry throught, cough, mucous build up, etc.) it blows really cold air into the room increasing cold-related symptoms. It also is so loud that it can be heard several rooms away - and that is at the lowest setting. DO NOT BUY!"
1,You get what you pay for,I just needed a small unit for our bedroom. This unit is so noisyeven on the lowest setting that I turn it off before we go to bed. Itdoes use a lot of water. I fill it about every 10 hours. I would recommendspending a little extra money and buying some other brand.
2,Cheap design,"I've had this humidifier for under 2 months. It humidifies the air ok... somewhat unsatisfying because there is no fog or water vapor to be seen. But it can rip through a gallon of water in 12 hours, so it must be doing something.The big warning is make sure you leave the unit on until all the water is gone or else it will go moldy in a matter of a couple of days. The filter is what soaks up the water and if left wet it molds up pretty qick and at the very least you have to buy a new filter. Just a poor design.When the unit is on high it extremely loud, unbelievably so. And this is its only positive because it drowns out my snoring and my fiance doesn't wake me up in the middle of the night. So she turns it on now even though we are between filters and it isnt humidifying anything."
3,Was good now it isn't,I really liked this humidifier at first. You may have needed 3 hands to fill it but at least it humidified the air. I don't like the filters. They smash easily and the gauge that reads if it's good or not only worked for a short time (then even new filters read bad). It's worth buying but don't expect it to last longer then 1 or 2 cold and flu seasons.
2,"Loud, and the filter idea is horrible","As others have said, it's loud. Even the low setting is too loud to have it on while you're watching TV. The high setting is just laughably loud. The other problem is the filter. It gets mildewy and gross after only a few weeks. Definitely not something you want to be blowing into the air in your home.On the other hand, it does get a lot of water into the air quickly. Still, the cons far outweigh the pros."
1,"Loud, awkward, cold - who would want this?","Agreed - this is just TOO LOUD even on the low setting. But even if it was silent, the bottom line is that it blows lots of cold air and barely any moisture. On top of that, the filter needs replacing and is fragile. The design isn't very good. I'll have to turn the heat up and negate what extra moisture i do get. You might as well just use your fan and put a wet towel somewhere in your room."
1,Loud and cheap quality- SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE MORE EXPENSIVE 1 YOU WERE LOOKING AT,"Holmes Cool Mist Humidifier - Small (HM1760-UC)NOT WORTH THE MONEY, NOT EVEN FOR THE CHEAP PRICE. SPEND A LITTLE MORE CASH TO GET A HUMIDIFIER THAT ACTUALLY HUMIDIFIES! TRUST ME YOU WONT REGRET THE DECISION"
1,Loud,"I just bought this a week ago from Target. It has two settings: Loud and Very loud. There's no reason the fan has to be that noisy. It should at least have a quiet setting for when you want it to be humid but not annoy visitors, etc.The tank could hold a lot more water if they hadn't given it such an odd shape. It wouldn't have cost much more plastic to make the tank more cylindrical. I have to refill mine every day and it would be nice if it lasted longer.This type of humidifier makes the air cooler, which I didn't realize before I bought it. In the winter you really want it warmer. Also the wick falls apart within a few months, which is annoying."
1,No worth the noise!,"We bought this given the name brand and I wish I would have read the Amazon reviews because it's going back to Bed, Bath Beyond today. It's so loud that I'm worried about my daughter's hearing. And the knob/control is loose and feels so flimsy. Guess I got what a paid for. Back it goes!"
1,Great for Winter Use- Cools your house and keeps you awake,Bypass this product unless you are interested in the following:* a constant turboprop noise level* an invisible cool mist that is invisible because there is no actual mist* creating a cool breeze to counteract the warming effects of your domicile's heating system
2,"Enough is Enough, Micheal","Okay, Michael, it's either put up or shut up time. You've done the covers of songs by artist who's talents you wish you had, but now it's time to prove your worth by doing some original music of your own.Many of the songs on this CD are good --not because of Michael's rendition of them, but because they were great songs to begin with. I can appreciate Mr. Bolton for covering songs he grew-up listening to (vol 1 and vol. 2 [we all have our favorites]), but enough is enough, already! Let's see if he can show some ""real"" talent and do some of his own material."
1,torture chamber music,"Bringing in the shears to shorn his proto-mullet is about as radical as balladeering Bolts gets on his latest installment of waxen tonsil-rattling covers. The formula remains the same: veteran soul material by the likes of Marvin Gaye, Ann Peebles, Louis Armstrong and Al Green fleeced and denatured as awful overblown orchestrations of pube-crimping, anglo-pleasing sap. Fans are sure to be tickled pinkish by the self-indulgent caterwauling. But even they might be inclined to turn up their snouts, if not at the fitting inclusion of the facile old acid lullaby Whiter Shade of Pale, then certainly at Moltin's excruciating emasculation of Dylan's Like A Rolling Stone. It's time for Michael Snap-on to cease and desist of the classics and muster the cajones to insert his own material in the white soul torture machine he's built for himself.Nothing less humiliating will suffice."
1,Message to Michael: good riddance!,"Michael Bolton, one of the most overrated and overexposed pop singers of the '90s -- with an unapologetic ego the size of the Empire State Building to boot -- butchers a second set of classic pop and R&B songs. Give it up Mikey, it's over for you. You are one of the few singers I've heard with the ability to drain any soul or substance out of an otherwise decent song. The performances on this CD are dreadful, as always, and everyone knows about you and your self-indulgent reputation now.This CD failed to hit the Billboard 200, reflecting the current state of the Boltonite's career. Don't waste your money on this one, e-shoppers. Buy the originals instead."
1,"Make the bad man stop, mommy! Make the bad man, STOP!","My mother is a fan of his, and I love my mother. But my dad and brother cannot stand Bolton (my mom loves to play his music in their house) and I think if I were to buy this CD for my mom for Christmas, I would lose a brother and father.Is my mother's hapiness worth the loss of a parent and a sibling?Something I must ponder as I think about the travesty it is, for Michael Bolton to be allowed to cover Marvin Gaye's music. That's like Jerry Lewis trying to take over as Clark Gable's Rhett Butler, in Gone with the Wind...It's not right America..."
1,A Pure piece of garbage,"Quite possibly the most overrated performer of our time. Not only can he not sing, not only can he not write, but he can't even HIRE writers to make up some new material for him to record! How many more ""Timeless: The Ripoffs"" albums is this no-talent going to record?"
2,Disappointing,"Michael Bolton fans who are ready for the kind of power and passion that was shown in the album ""Love Songs"" will surely be disappointed in this offering. The tune choices were anything but classics, in my humble opinion, and the renditions were without the artistry we have all come to expect of Mr. Bolton. The first classics album was an absolute stunner. This album is stunningly inferior to it. The renditions are better than many artists could muster, but certainly not what we have come to expect from Michael Bolton. All in all a poor performance. I hope future albums are much better."
1,Bad bad quality,"very very old videos, poor quality of the images. I was hoping for something more up to date, not videos from the 80's."
5,just perfect,juan luis guerra is one of the best singer/writer of all latin music. so if you love his music you will love his videos. they are very colorful and very caribbean ish. buy it.
2,unreliable media,I had TDK DVD+R media for about threee years and have not had any problems. With Magnavox I had two failures in the row copying dvd files. I used TDK and worked nicely and instantly.
3,video review,This book was great! It really entertained my daughter because she loves hamsters and loves other small animals. Hopefully she'll get a hamster if shes good!
4,School project,These figures were great for a school diorama project on Tropical Rainforests. We glued them into a cardboard box and covered it with ivy.
4,For My Princess!,"Bought this tag for a muscular Shar-Pei/Am Staff Mix. I didn't want a tag that had rhinestones and coloring on it (thus leading my better half to think the dog looked too ""girlie""). I wanted something durable AND fashionable. Well, this tag fits the bill. Very cute. Only one small issue, it tarnishes slightly and develops a greyish patina."
2,TOO COMPLICATED,ITS TOO COMPLICATED TO INSTALL THE WIPER COWL. IT TAKES SOMEONE THAT KNOWS BODY ASSEMBLY FOR VEHICLES. THE SHAPE OF THE WIPER COWL IS NOT EVEN TO THE SHAPE OF THE VEHICLE.
5,Domingo dominates.,"The recording is wonderful. Placido Domingo could not be a better Hoffman. And the version of The Tales of Hoffman performed here is wonderful, entertaining."
1,"Defective disc, inadequate cast list","The disc stops during Act II (1:12:47). After fast-forwarding, the picture and sound are out of sinc. The single sheet inside lists only the chapter selections on one side and Kultur's advertising on the back. There is no mention of who is singing the role of Nicklausse. Kultur could do better."
3,No better than adequate peformance,"Tales of Hoffman is an opera that even a mediocre performance is enjoyable. I have seen much better performances than this DVD, although for the most part I would rate this one ""adequate"". Nobody seemed inspired except Domingo, the audio from the 1981 production is not up to todays standards (or even the standards of the 1980s), and some of the ""creative"" ideas of this production didn't work."
1,kultur shock,This is a total DVD disaster fom Kultur. I have tried two copies of this wonderful performance and both had a miserable soundtrack and opera is sound. Volume swells and fades throughout the performance destroying a terrific production. Would love to know what Placido Domingo thinks of it. Dr. Mirakle must have been the sound mixer.
2,Not DVD Quality,"The content was good but the Video quality was very poor. I was watching on my Sanyo HD PLV-60 projector. It looks like the master tape was a VHS or 3/4"" tape. The original show was taped in 1981 by the British. Those people are perfectionists. The only explanation for the poor quality must be 2nd and 3rd generation of tape or a bad transfer from PAL to NTSC TV.You should not watch this DVD on a big screen."
2,Not funny,"I have come to expect a lot from Broadway Theatre Archive. They save the best, I thought. However, this is defintely not the best version of Tartuffe that I have seen. I first saw it onstage, presented by the Trinity Square Reperatory Company in Providence, Rhode Island. The audience, including me, laughed so much we almost fell out of our seats. But, this version, unfortunately, is boring. If you want to see a really funny version, watch the BBC filmed version of the Royal Shakepeare Company's production of Tartuffe. It's a great laugh!"
4,Letting Go,"This was a very good book! I found it very therapeutic! The book really addresses the importance of what real love is. Most people identify with the love they first learned from their families, particularly their parents. As with the character Mya. Through her journey of self-discovery she learned what real love was about-having it for yourself first. Until she found the love for herself, and healed from her past, family troubles, and learned to forgive, and accept...only than could she let go in every way. In a way I was surprised by a few things (I won't tell), but we as women do have to get away from the fairytales the ""happily everafters"" so to speak. In the end though, she got the love she truly wanted because she ""let go"" and was able to move on.I would love to see this into a movie. It was good read, and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there were a lot of typos, and it confused me at times. Margaret writes well, but needs a new editor."
5,Riveting,"Once again Ms. Johnson-Hodge has put together a thought provoking novel, telling the story of courtship with a real life twist. I found the novel interesting because it made me constantly think. From a male point of view, this one is a keeper."
2,Typical,"Woman ruins the best thing to ever enter her life by cheating on him, but no it's not her fault. It's her mother's, father's, brother's, and society's fault. Of course she turns into a dread wearing, incense burning, african trinkett buying, self marrying mess who finds the ""perfect black man"" who of course is also a dread wearing, incense burning, african trinket buying self marrying mess."
4,Poetic Justice,"I love MJH to death, having read all of ""The Real Deal"", ""A New Day"" (twice), and ""Butterscotch Blues"". Her writing always entrances me and takes my breath away. Though I am not a poetry lover, Hodge gives me that through her eloquent style of writing. My only problem with this particular novel was the ending. I suppose Mya and Jeff could've gotten back together and made the story more typical. Okay, so Mya finds love in herself, but did she have to attract a man as equally edified and self-loving as she? It was all a bit far-fetched in spite of how well the story was written. There are a lot of people who love themselves and have it all together, but most are intimdiated by it and therefore never approach such individuals. Other than that unexpected ending, I still adore the author's ability to weave a tapestry with her words...."
4,Take a load off your fanny,"Even though I owned a vinyl copy of ""Rock Of Ages"" in the mid-70's, I frankly never ""got"" all the fawning rock press and rabid fan worship surrounding The Band until I screened ""The Last Waltz"". The group displayed expert musicianship and an on-stage charisma in that film that thier rather pedestrian studio releases never revealed. ""Rock Of Ages"" consequently ""grew"" on me and is now of my favorite ""live"" albums. The 2001 re-issue adds a bonus disc that may excite some listeners and leave others (like myself) underwhelmed. The supposed ""Holy Grail"" on the bonus disc are four numbers featuring Bob Dylan. ""Some people have been waiting for 30 years to hear these 4 songs..."" trumpets the liner notes. ""Some people apparently need to get out more"", answer I after listening to them, particularly the embarrassingly botched ""Like A Rolling Stone"". Still, an excellent one-purchase distillation of all The Band's strengths (Disc 1, that is, which contains the complete original album!)"
4,"Good, But not the Best","The Band were one of the greatest live acts around, there is no question that their live material is better than their studio stuff. Don't get me wrong there are some great tunes on this show, ""Dont Do It"" ""Get Up Jake"" ""Life is a Carnival"" just to name a few, but they are not Great versions, their just good. I find it hard to listen to this album all the way through I just get frusterated, especially at Rob Danko's shaky voice in this show. Get The Last Waltz if you want to hear some Great Band. I recommend this for long time Band fans, but if you are new to this group get The Last Waltz or Music from The Big Pink and go from there."
5,If You Don't Buy This Your Ears Will Hate You Forever,"This is not only the best ""Band"" I've ever heard, it's some of the best music period. Beginning with a super hot rendition of ""Don't Do It"" was nothing more than a kick start. While listening to this first track I became apprehensive because I figured the album could only down turn after such an amazing performance. How wrong I was. The guest horn players bring a blistering quality (and normally I hate horns) that Levon and the boys just seem to feed off. This album just gets better and better the deeper you get into it. I'm absolutely furious with myself for not having gotten this years ago!"
4,The Band's Hits,Old hits rerecorded. It was a gift. I like the older style. The selections are very good. I think it will be liked as a present.
4,Good looking coverall,"The Dickies twill coverall looks good and seems tough enough although I've only had it for a few weeks and haven't put it to anything that could rip the fabric yet. I bought a size S, which fits fine although it's a little hard to raise my hands over my head (I'm 5' 8""). If I bought again I might try a M for my size but I wanted a sleeker fit rather than something baggy.The build quality seems good. The main zipper feels kind of cheap so it may be the first thing to go but everything else is up to snuff. I'm happy with my purchase."
3,Heavy duty but sizes run short,"This is a heavy, quality stitched coverall. The weight of this is great for cooler days, but you will not want to wear this on a hot day as it will be like you are trapped in a sauna. However, this is probably one of the downsides of the material being rough n' tough, so to speak, because it's thicker. The other downside for me, is the sizing. I'm 6'2"" 180 lbs and I ordered a large tall. In terms of width, I'm basically swimming in this coverall. But it's a struggle to get in because it's just too short."
4,"Very Good Coverall, Better than Dickies' Other Offering","These are overall very good coveralls, much better than the Dickies 4861 - Basic Coverall which cost a little less. Unlike those others, these 7-1/2 ounce twill have covered, zippered pockets (so things don't fall out when you work horizontally), a buttoning top collar (so you can cover your shirt or undershirt), and are less pourous (fewer things sift through the material onto your underclothing and skin). They are not perfect, but are an awfully good choice if your local stores have quit carrying coveralls as mine have."
3,Short long sleeves,"I ordered the medium (regular) size. I wear small/medium size shirts, 30/30 pants, and weigh 145 lbs.The coverall fits well, until I raise my arms. When I do, the long arm sleeves fall down about 5-6 inches from my wrists, plus, the coverall ride up, and the gusset pushes up on the crotch area. The pants legs are actually quite long, and until you put on your boots/shoes, they almost feel too long.I bought these for crawlspaces, and when you're crawling, even when wearing gloves, most of my wrist and forearms are exposed. I was told the sleeves feel short, but this was cheaper than other brands. Next time, I'll spend the extra $ and get long sleeves that actually stay long.The material seems sturdy and think, so if you don't need to crouch, crawl, or need to work overhead much, these would be ideal. Lots of zippered pockets, access to clothes under the coveralls, and gear loop are also good features."
5,Dickies 48799 Deluxe Coverall Blended Black X-Large,These Dickies Deluxe Coveralls are just what Iexpected them to be.Top Quality! They look good and fit good.
4,Good stuff.,I wash this this every weekend and it seems to take the toil of daily mechanic workso I will buy another one like this when this one die on me!
2,The people who size their shirts don't size the coveralls,"Compared with other products manufactured by Dickies the sizing of these is way off.I usually wear an Extra Large Tall or Extra Large Shirt. Double Extra Large Shirts are like tents on me.I'm 6'3"" and tried on an Extra Large Tall coverall. I Couldn't even get it over my shoulders even though Tall shirts are usually a bit to long for me.I ordered an Extra Large, Extra Tall coverall. It is barely Tall enough for me and fits snugly even without clothing underneath it. I am afraid it will no longer fit if I wash it with warm water or dry it.It drives me nuts that these aren't offered in reasonable sizes. The sizing is so far out of the norm that they should offer sizing charts specifically for their coveralls. I wonder how many other people have become so frustrated that they kept coveralls that almost fit."
5,Love it,"Comfortable, keeps you warm, well designed outfit for outdoor work. i have used it twice since the purchse. Go to the next size while ordering."
4,Good Overalls,"Size XL Tall Pleasantly Generously Sized - I have 40"" waist, 32"" Inseam, 34"" Sleeve, and stand 6' 3"" at 210 lbs. The waist is very loose and the cuffs droop over my boots. The sleeves end just over my wrists. I don't wear coveralls to make a fashion statement and provided I'm not working around machinery which might grab the loose material, I'm very comfortable in these coveralls.Sturdy material tailored with convenient pockets. If you want to look like the shown model, don't order larger than necessary - these coveralls are already generously tailored. Must remove shoes to put on - zippered legs would have been nice."
4,Coveralls,"Dickies Men's 7 1/2 Ounce Twill Deluxe Long Sleeve Coverall, Dark Navy, Large RegularI found the coveralls to be excellent. The product fitted well and was well worth the cost."
2,Problem with Quality'',Has began to skip after the 3rd playing? I have a brand New JVC CD PLAYER No Reason for Poor quaility of cd. I havn't even listen to the entire cd Yet! I handle my Cd's properly and use a cloth cd holder! Send me another one!
5,Indescribable,What can one say about Luther Vandross? This is a must have for any music lover. It soothes one's weary self like wine & a warm bath.
5,GOOD ALTERNATIVE,"Beats plastic loofahs any day! Since its from a plant its not as soft as you would expect. It does the job by exfoliating the skin with its rough, and hard texture. A few weeks since i started using this body scrubber, and it has still maintained its shape. No falling apart like those plastic scrunchy loofahs."
1,Give me a breaK!!,For the cost of this loofa sponge i could have purchased 3 normal size ones from walmart. it was way too small for the price. i guess i should have researched it more! ..lol. Anyway 1 star...way too expensive for its tiny size. OVER PRICED.
3,Great Anecdotes,"The stories about playing poker on the old pro circuit are worth the price of the book. I enjoyed the brief attention paid to the often lucky final hand showdowns and the much greater time given to interviews with the winners. The big disappointment is the photos attached to the text. They resemble what photos would look like if they were taken by an infant, through a foot of water, with the lights turned off. The pictures should have been omitted; they are that bad.This is an OK read with some exceptional advice from the top names in poker from the past two decades. Not destined to be a bestseller, but a good book for poker enthusiasts."
1,More like an almanac than a HOW TO book,Reminds me of one of those baseball books with statistics but not much else. The stories are short and typically discuss one or two hands at most. If you want history it may have value but it will not improve your play.
5,Little Miss books by Roger Hargreaves,My 6 year old granddaughter loves these Little Miss books. She's received several of them over the years. They're easy for her to understand.
5,Pleasant and Delightful Read,"Year in and year out, the letters flood in to number 221B Baker Street, which is now home of the Abbey National Building Society. Some are naive, others envious, pleading and peremptory, and some offer intelligent criticisms. All of them testify to an undying curiosity in Conan Doyle's great creation.Every single one receives an answer from Mr Holmes' secretary. Abbey National is proud to provide this service for the Great Detective and happy to collaborate in the compilation of this anthology.Richard Lancelyn Green has chosen a representative selection and supplies fascinating answers to many of the queries.You will find this book to be both amusing and delightful."
5,Amazing,This such a good book. Intensity doesn't begin to describe it.Recommend read for anyone over 18. Subject matter is really twisted and scary
5,isn't it ironic?,"Almost everything can be construed as ironic, as Wayne C. Booth shows, but there are different types and degrees of irony and different works of literature have used irony in different ways. This book is essential for understanding literature and especially essential for understanding modern fiction.Of course, irony depends upon a reader capable of seeing the irony. This book isn't just for English Majors. It's for everyone who wants to be able to make judgments about the news, movies, paintings, etc. for themselves rather than just accept what is given at face value. You won't see the same world out there after reading this book."
5,A Book That Sparkles and Shines,"If you are a child of the early 60s like me, or just someone who appreciates great photography, then you will love this sweetly nostalgic look at aluminum Christmas trees. Season's Gleamings is full of beautiful color photos showing the amazing variety of trees available at the time: small silver tabletop models, giant gold seven-footers, trees festooned with period ornaments, and others shimmering in the glow of rotating color wheels. I loved flipping through the pages of this book and being reminded of the Christmases of my childhood. I highly recommend it as a gift for family and friends, or as a holiday coffee table book for your own home. Wonderful!"
3,It was my own fault,"I made the mistake of reading another review from a customer who said ""It makes a great coffee table book."" As a result I was expecting a larger book in size. I should have looked at the size on the add instead of making this assumption as it isn't physically large enough to be what I would consider a 'coffee table book'. However, it was a used book and looked pretty much new so I was thrilled with the condition!"
2,boring,"This book was disappointing - I thought it would have lots of old adverts on aluminum trees and accessories, along with more history and vintage pictures. Instead it was just blurry pictures of trees set up and lit in someone's studio."
2,overdone,a little over cooked. not as nice as plain. good flavor but too brown . could use a little more salt too
2,Not as Potato-Chipy as I'd Like,"I was hoping for a more potato-chipy product, both in taste and texture. This is ok if you're looking for a thick, very-chewy chip (that really needs a dip to complement the taste) -- but not if you want a product that's easy to eat and is tasty all by itself."
3,Just ok,"I bought these in October of 2010 when there was some sort of liquidation sale (~$10 for a case). We really did not enjoy them, and we still have some left. I snack on them every once in awhile. I can't imagine paying the current price, unless the recipe has been reformulated or now has some sort of health angle."
1,These chips are addictive!!!,"I AM SITTING HERE FINISHING A BAG OF STACY'S PARMESAN GARLIC AND HERB CHIPS THAT I JUST OPENED THIS AFTERNOON!! THEY'RE NOT CHEAP IN THE GROCERY STORE, SO I DECIDED TO GOOGLE THEM TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY COUPONS ON-LINE. (I'M NOT PROUD!) IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT THEY CAN BE PURCHASED THRU AMAZON. PERFECT AND MUCH, MUCH CHEAPER!!! TRY THE TEXARKANA HOT IF YOU HAVEN'T. THEY'RE YUMMY BUT NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!!! THANKS AMAZON!!!! I'M PLACING A HUGE ORDER RIGHT NOW!!!!"
5,Super Tasty,These are fantastic!! If only they were low calorie they would be perfect!! Best chips Ive ever had! Try them!
2,Looks nice.,"I was very excited when I bought this dryer. I loved the look of it. Now I will tell you that this dryer does get very hot. Unfortunately it seems to only get hot in the top/front. The hood design of this dryer does not allow for air to circulate around the whole hood. While most hood dryers have holes throughout the hood, this one does not. I have to dry the top/front of my hair, then lean my head out so the back dries. This was a waste of money, but like I said, it looks nice. Dont waste your time or money on this dryer!"
2,"OK, but not great","These are definitely affordable, but get down towards cheap. The connectors don't really snap into ports. I've tried pulling up on the tab to expand it, but I'm worried I'll break them -- and it doesn't help much.The image displaying now is neither the one that was there when I ordered it, nor what I got. I got regular RJ45 termination plugs for cable ends; the current picture is showing female connectors."
4,this book helped me to be a chicago eyewitness,"What do you need when you are in a big city for the first time and just for 4 days? You need a simple guide, one that you can take with you while you're exploring the area. Using the top 10 system you can find all the highlights in a few seconds. As I need some structure in my exploration too, I used this guide in combination with Frommer's Chicago day by day. It made my visit to Chicago to a success. There will certainly be a next time."
4,Great Book with a great pullout map!,I had traveled to Chicago before but I bought this book for my travel partner who had never been in the area. There were great suggestions for places to eat and what to see. It includes websites and phone numbers for all of the place suggestions and it also gives you hours of operation. The absolute best part about this book is the included map. It gives you an easy to read map of the city and a transit map that is super helpful on the go. I would definitely recommend this product if you're spending a few days in Chicago and you need suggestions.
1,A waste of money,This book was published in 2012 yet it does not include key items to visit that were opened in 2008 e.g. the famous Driehaus Museum. All maps for Oak Park with the Frank Lloyd Wright houses are wrong so we had to wander round to try to spot the houses which were put on different streets or in the wrong place on the right street. Even the L map was out of date. We searched for the tea room in the Intercontinental hotel but it does not exist. A travel guide needs to provide reasonably up to date information - the houses in Oak Park have not moved for nearly one hundred years. When you are only spending a couple of days in Chicago you do not want duff information - this book is a waste of money.
3,Valid info but somewhat out of date,I missed that it was several years old. The majority of the info was still valid and the map was handy but it would be better if a newer model was issued. Great format.
5,Perfect,"This truly is a perfect book. Read it at your peril, though. Life may never be the same after. That's the free bonus experience that comes with reading."
1,nothing personal by nirmala,I am very openened minded and willing to take in just about any new insight in my search for enlightenment.I regret the money spent on this !
5,Fantastic.,"Thrash novel at it's finest. Really a terrific read, I've read it multiple times, now.The rest of Nathan Singer's work is great, too."
3,Great book as long as magnets do not break,The book was great and inspired my kids to learn about magnets. The best part is that the book introduced magic that they could do easily. The book was easy to understand with graphics that attracted kids. The only problem is that the magnets broke easily if dropped. Three of the five doughnut magnets broke within the first day of use.
4,A Must have for Biology students (7-12 grade),"I am a Christian Life Science teacher and read this book because my neighbor recommended it. The author relates many falacies in the ""theory"" of evolution in a very concise way. It is something all students should read. I would highly recommend this book to Christian science teachers or parents of public school children. This would be a great tool for revealing the myths of evolution taught in the public school classrooms."
2,Religious myths versus scientific arguments,"Hank is committed to the idea that Genesis, itself composed of competing tribal legends from the Bronze Age, somehow contains scientific statements. His religious faith compels him to reject the preponderance of scientific evidence in favor of evolution.If you prefer bible stories to science, Hank's book might be right for you. If not, useful scientific books that discuss evolution without religious bias includeEvolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters (Hardcover)by Donald R. ProtheroBrian Charlesworth, Evolution, A Very Short Introduction (contains an excellent bibliography)Simon Morris, The Crucible of CreationRichard Leakey, Origins ReconsideredEdward J. Larson, Evolution: The Remarkable History of a Scientific TheoryThe Counter-Creationism Handbook (Paperback) by Mark Isaak (Author)Scientists Confront Intelligent Design and Creationism by Andrew J. Petto (Editor), Laurie R. GodfreyWhy Evolution Is True by Jerry A. Coyne"
5,always a quality read,Ms. Marsh consistently delivers characters with warmth andan absorbing plot. Always a treat!
1,When plans change,"I did not enjoy this book. I thought the chapters were choppy and the story shallow. In the ""Notes From The Author"" section at the end of the book the author reveals her goal is to address the issues involved in changing careers or paths after many years of investment and how does one evaluate those years. Were they worthwhile and therefore am I worthwhile. I think her goals were worthy of a story but I do not think the story portrayed her goals. I was especially bothered that the single pastor was so quick to kiss the main character before she had made peace with God. I will not spend the time to read other books in this series. I am glad others have enjoyed the book, I expected more."
4,Fun afternoon read,"This is a fun and cozy series. The plot isn't as deep as some of her other books, but very enjoyable."
2,Don't Stay In Place,"These supports managed to help alleviate some of my metastarsal pain. However, they will not stay in place. I've literally had to tape them into my shoes for them to stay in place. The result is a sticky mess after a few weeks when the tape wears off."
2,disappointed,"Item arrived quickly, but contained no directions on how/where to install in shoe, nor did there appear to be any adhesive/tape to keep the pads in place."
3,Spenco,"The pads are fairly comfortable, but they do not solve my problem. That said, they move around inside my shoe. They need some type of sticky material to hold their position better in the shoe."
3,They are o.k.,I have been worn them for a while. They are just fine. They doesn't help my feet problem much since I have a skinny feet. Thanks though
2,Not what I had hoped,I was hoping this would take care of my ball of foot pain but it hasnt done the trick. I guess I will need to find a full length insert as this one isnt cutting it.
5,Excellent!,"This book was in better than good condition, came soon enough for me to catch up in class and had the required components, thanks a lot for saving me money!"
5,GREAT SERVICE,"Amazing service, I will keep shopping with amazon time and time again, Thank you foe the fast service,A++++"
1,Too many errors,I found too many errors within this text. I was amazed that they were not located in the proofing prior to selling. I had no choice but to use this book for a class in Medical Assisting. Major errors including defining terms with the wrong definition. One section states a word meaning one thing and then the next section had a complete different definition. I recommend any instructor seeing this to use another text.
1,Mad as He.................,I ordered this book for school as I do many of my books from amazon. I paid 16.50 for the book to come failry quickly to get the book and it is written all over and in very poor condition. I am not able to read some of the pages because they are all highlighted and written in. So I have waisted money that I really cannot afford.
4,Good Guy Wins! Good Guy Wins!,"RObert Parker writes good page-turning mysteries and this one is in his upper echelon.Jesse Stone is a big-time L.A. cop who comes to be the chief of police in a small Massachusetts town. In this novel he solves two crimes - one a local rape and the other a serial killer. Along the way he has relationships with several women including an ex-wife he can not surrender. (Somehow, this middle-aged taciturn guy keeps getting the babes, but somehow it works.)The reader will find himself rooting for Stone in the rape matter and being very satisfied with its conclusion.In the serial killer plot, Stone's adversary is extremely unique and interesting. To tell more would be to ruin the first third of the book but suffice it to say Parker has masterfully created a challenging nemesis for his hero.Parker's writing, as always, is clean, concise and keeps the story moving. A good page-turner of a mystery."
1,"""Stone Cold"" left me stone cold!!","What a disappointment after having watched the TV movie based on this novel which I enjoyed along with the other Jesse Stone movies. Call me a prude but this book was full of language which I find very offensive and as is usually the case when profanity is used, it does not add a thing to the story line. I find myself wanting to send the author a dictionary so that he has access to other words in our English language that do not offend even the prudish readers like myself. I will probably not read any more of Mr. Parker's novels. What a shame!!! He might want to consider reading some of Dee Henderson's novels where she tells exciting, riveting police and detective stories WITHOUT using profanity and taking The Lord's name in vain."
4,More fun in Paradise,"I should probably have gone for five stars, but I'm a tough grader. I have found the Spenser series to be very good, but after so many years I wonder if it's run its course. The new character of Jesse Stone has much in common with Spenser while remaining an individual. My only quibble with the book, and it's much the same as my feelings about his novel ""Shrink Rap,"" is that there's a bit too much psych-babble. That may not be entirely fair, but the scenes where his characters are undergoing psychotherapy are too neat, too contrived. It is a minor aggravation, though, as the book succeeds extremely well. The plot is clever, I love the dialogue and the manner in which he developes new characters. Do women like Rita Fiore really exist? Now that Jesse's and Spenser's world are intermingling, I cannot wait to read the next Spenser (already ordered from Amazon) where they finally meet!"
4,"Fast, easy read","A plot that's good enough to captivate, and a book that's short enough to satisfy. A very entertaining mystery."
4,Night Passage,As always Robert B. Parker writes a great book. I have enjoyed all of the Jesse Stonestories so far. I have three more to read and I know they will be great.I highly recommend all his books.
2,Stone Cold Disgusted,"I hate to ruin a book for someone before they've even read it but this is the worst Robert B Parker book I've ever read.There is a serial killer(s) on the loose in Paradise. That should tell you something right there. Okay and they kill someone Jesse has had a relationship with. Good idea? Yes, but they don't kill the self-centered, ladder climbing, sorry, the very lovely Jenn. Parker really missed his chance to give Jesse a life. I won't be reading Jesse Stone novels until Jenn is gone!"
2,Not so hot,"I pride myself on having read the original Spenser-The Godwulf Manuscript-while it was a HB in the stores, and I've gotten lots of pleasure from all that's followed. But this one's a stinker, folks. Jesse Stone, who began life as a character distinct from Spenser, becomes in this one merely a clone of him, hewing to a rather tedious version of Spenser's philosophy of life. There are a lot of ponderous looks and deep, anguished sighs shared with various females, too. Overdone."
4,Predictable but Entertaining,"Any fan of Robert Parker, especially those who like his Jesse Stone novels, will find this novel enjoyable.This work is more about developing the character of Jesse Stone than it is about the two crimes around which the story centers. Both crimes - we know who done it quickly without much buildup or mystery. But Jesse is front and center. And he seems much more melancholy, conflicted, and distant from his fellow man and woman than in any novel up this point. It will be interesting to see where Parker takes the character.Overall, another comfortable - that's a good word for Parker novels - piece of storytelling."
3,Pretty Good,"I love reading Robert B. Parker novels because of his good imagination and fast paced writing. If you're a big Rober B. Parker fan then buy this book, otherwise try a Spenser novel first. Jesse Stone is a worthy character, but his strengths aren't utilized enough in this novel. And like so many other Parker books, the end comes too suddenly leaving you somewhat disappointed. Parker needs to concentrate all of his efforts on writing as many more ""Spenser"" novels as he can before that character becomes too old."
3,Stone-Cold Turns Lukewarm,This was somewhat of a disappointment. In the past Robert B Parker novels was suspenseful and intriguing. Only half way through the novels you pretty much got who the criminals were. But in Stone Cold there really were no surprises the plot was given away half way through the story. Which was surprising since there were two stories being told. There really was no climax. Everything was pretty predictable.
1,An immensly enjoyable read,"Just a joy to read an author who uses words with so much economy in this age of overbloated novels. Reads like a breeze,and an interesting character in Jessie Stone. Spenser accepted his fallabilies and marched on. Stone has similar faults but, allows these faults to define him and, as a result lacks in self confidence and can get alternately whiney or abusive. Might have been what Spenser would have wound up like if he had not met Susan. I would like to see what Parker does with this character in the future"
1,AND THE GOOD NEWS IS - - -,"And the good news is---I only took two days to read it!!!Whew!!! I'm glad that's over. Jesse & Jenn are two of themost pathetic characters I have ever read about---theydeserve each other. Parker should have put two bullets ineach of THEM and put them out of their misery!!!where is """"POODLE SPRINGS""""---""""PERCHANCE TO DREAM""""---AND---""""SPENSER"""" ???? C'mon already!!!"
4,Back to the Basics,"""Stone Cold"" is one of the better, if not the best thing, Parker has written for a while. His Spencer novels are still great, but much of the allure of that series lies in the readers' love for Spencer, Susan, Hawk, and (of course)Pearl the Wonder Dog II. In ""Stone Cold"" the characters are still interesting--especially Rita--but it is the story and the action that drives the novel and keeps the reader turning the pages even, in my case, when I knew I should have been sleeping. You can feel the heat that Stone is under from the killing spree that he is trying to stop along with the tension of his mixed-up love life. The best part, however, lies in the readers being allowed to see some form of violence acted out on such characters--and here Parker does not spare the reader. In a world that has such monsters in it, it is good to feel Jesse hitting the bastards--and you do feel it--the writing is that damned good. This is Parker at his best, folks, don't miss it."
2,I shelved it,"I know the world has its violence and immorality, but I'd rather focus on beneficial positive thoughts. Thieves, murderers and deviates not welcome in my mind or my home."
4,B+,"I was not huge Parker fan until I read his previous novel. LOVED IT! This one was not quite as good but it was interesting and it wasn't filled with too much boredom, but could be considered so at times. 4 stars."
5,Can't wait for the next one......,I've read all the Jesse Stone series books and haven't been disappointed yet. Once you start reading it's hard to put down. Always great characters and plots...... I would recommend this series to all.........
2,Why do we care?,"Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry."
3,Overpriced,This plot was really not very complex or complicated and definitely not worth paying $24.95 for. It's not as if there is any character development in the book. I would have paid $9.50 for it but with the current pricing it is vastly overpriced.
5,Relief!,"I searched the internet and found this was a good price for this product and if you have Amazon Prime it's really a good deal. My order of Cysta-Q arrived earlier than expected which was a relief since I have Interstitial Cystitis and I was in a horrible flair. Those of you who have this disease know what I'm talking about!!! I began to feel some relief after taking this product for about 2 days, it is helful and natural and I like that. I hope to be able to get off all these meds I take for IC, I hope to be able to treat my IC naturally someday."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"I have IC disease and use Cystoprotek, but the manufacturer was out of stock for a few months so I tried this product. It did absolutley NOTHING for my pain and I had to go back to the doctor to have a bladder distention. I'm not even sure these pills have are much to them since the list of ingredients on the bottle has hardly anything listed. Go with Cystoprotek, Amazon sells it."
2,Not for IC,"If you use this product, make sure you aren't treating interstitial cystitis. My urologist recommended for IC but it absolutely killed my pelvic area where I have a majority of my IC pain."
4,A good read,It was good and thoughtful and a little disturbing as the story has some sex parts that I don't really think kids under 14 should read as it certainly bugged me for a day. On the other hand it's nice that Ruby was so truthful and probably for most her age fought so much with her mother. It made me think and I liked it. It had a dreary sad tone the whole way through. It's a short easy read saying how most teenagers are.
5,YOU WANT THIS!,"Ernie Barnes was a very talented artist. He's probably best known for his work featured on tv's GOOD TIMES and Marvin Gaye's album I WANT YOU. The book chronicles Barnes journey from football player to artist. He talks about life in the NFL as a player, a young African American and a survivor of the horrors that are the business of professional football. His sketches and paintings tell his story from the trenches to the gallery. I was lucky enough to get an autographed copy for less than 5.00"
5,Lets go for a hike,"A Walk for Sunshine is a book I truly enjoyed reading. It is an inspirational tale about perseverence for a cause. While reading about the setbacks in the beginning I was impressed that Jeff was able to keep going on the journey. The story is somewhat a step by step telling of the hike. Personally, I was interested in reading about each new section of the trail and the adventures and people Jeff met along the way. What I liked most about the story was by the time I finished it I really wanted to get out and go hiking for a few days in the woods."
3,2nd Appalachian Story.,This is my second appalachian book. I enjoyed reading Jeff Alt's rendition due to his deeply personal reason for the undertaking of this enormous physical task. He described the physical demands of the hike fairly well. I would recommend this book to anyone who has aspirations to make this hike. Anyone who has made the hike would fully appreciate the descriptions of each location noted.
4,Hiking at its best,This was a very moving story and educational along the way. Makes me want to hike part of the trail.
4,Gives a new perspective,A reason to hike the Appalachian Trial. Interesting story around why and how. Good read about a unique man and a unique situation.
4,You will be motivated by this title!,"Jeff Alt's 147-day, 2,160-mile Appalachian Trail journey inspired an annual charity walk which has to date raised over $140,000 for the special needs home at which Alt's brother resides in Ohio. In A Walk for Sunshine, Alt describes his half-year hiatus from civilization, during which he encountered the kindness of strangers, the ravages of the wild, the extremes of nature, and the breath-taking beauty of the American countryside. Our narrator is humorous and positive, finding the beauty and laughter everywhere. Alt includes an epilogue of ""Life Lessons From the Trail"" featuring inspirational discoveries for the reader to draw on in his or her own life challenges.The original book suffered from sophomoric grammar errors and poor spelling, but the updated edition allows Alt's enthusiasm and inspiration to shine through unencumbered by a lack of editing. Highly recommended."
2,a painful read,The author's journey is admirable on many levels. Thru-hiking the AT is a dream of mine. Raising money for charity is amazing and selfless!But this book was so incredibly boring to read. The writing was mechanical and overly methodical. The lack of emotion and description was painful. This felt like a high-school book report.There are many other AT thru-hike reads that do a better job of capturing the emotion and beauty of this hike. I *would* recommend this book for young readers as the author takes care to sanitize his language.
4,It's ok,"I admire how he was committed to doing this walk to raise money for the home his brother is in, but I would like to have heard more insight into the people he met along the way and more description of the homes and inns he stayed in. I'm sure the people who helped him along the way would have liked to read more about that too. It's not a book I was passionate about."
4,Another Great AT Saga,"This is another absorbing saga of a through-hike on theAppalachian Trail. From Georgia to Maine he describes thetrials and tribulations, both mental and physical, ofhauling a 50 lb pack up hill and down dale for several months.What is unique about this book is his accouning of some anti-social behavior by other thru-hikers which was cause for concernup and down the trail until they finally left,possibly in some measure to his having finally confronted them.All of this was entwined with his major motivation which was toraise funds for Sunrise, a home for developementally disabledadults in NW Ohio. A good read for anyone who likes adventurestories, especially AT thru-hiker sagas."
4,enjoyable and interesting book,I enjoyed this book because it was very interesting to learn what it took for this young man to hike through the Appalachian's. As a christian it reminds me of the trek we are daily taking to make heaven our home.
5,A Walk for Sunshine,"For anyone who hikes or has backpacked along the Applachian Trail this book is for you. It will bring back fond memories of your trail experiences. It is easy, fun reading yet packed full of good advice and lessons learned along the way. Jeff had a dual purpose in fulfilling his dreams: to thru-hike the AT and to raise funds for Sunshine, Inc., a group home for mentally retarded and disabled residents. This book describes how Jeff accomplished both of these dreams."
5,I was very inspired by A Walk for Sunshine,I just finished reading Jeff Alt's A Walk for Sunshine and I loved it. I have read many books on the Appalachian Trail recently but there was something very special about this book. It was more than just the fact that he was doing this for his brother (which was very important) but I felt like I was hiking along with him every step. I highly recommend it to everyone. Jeff really makes you want to pick a cause and hike the trail.
5,If your a Micheal Stanley band and fan of Jonah Collins,This cd has a good blend of songs to give you an idea of their sound and their music and has alot of tracks from stage pass which had Jonah Collins before he left to some of the old fans like Tom P i work with this is a huge plus so if you want to get your feet wet with their music this is a good collection for you
1,leaps of faith for a poor finish,"This book was cheesy, bland, and took some great leaps of faith to get to the end for a poor finish. I realize that silhouette novels are supposed to be schmaltzy, but I didn't realize how true this was until I actually read one; not an action I intend to repeat anytime soon. So if you like silly stories without much content and a baby, this book is for you. If you want a little more to your tale with at least the illusion of reasonability then I suggest that you look elsewhere."
2,A incomplete book with a lot of filler,"While perhaps suitable for a beginning gardener, this book omits many useful and common species while including obscure cultivars that are virtually indistinguishable from one another. Important cultural facts are often missing or buried in the cookie-cutter approach to each species. This book has no index, the omission of which may point to hasty editing. More experienced gardeners should look at books written by Steven Still."
5,"Very, very uplifting","This CD is for any Christain. I love the narrations by Max Lucado that come from his book ""When Christ Comes"". This CD relaxes me and helps me have a great day. There are many excellent songs on this CD that the narrations resemble."
4,Great voice.,"Dulce Pontes made fado appealing to younger people. I like Amalia Rodrigues but she wasn't someone I would listen to on a regular basis. I have this CD in my car and listen to it whenever I need to relax. Dulce makes fado allot more enjoyable. Love this CD, it is great."
5,Timeless music,"I was introduced to this wonderful cd while I was in Portugal many years ago and have since shared it with many family members and friends. If you are diligent, look up the lyrics -- simply breathtaking.Enjoy!"
1,Did NOTHING for me!,"took for 5 weeks, not even 1 lb lost. This product not good at all! Would give 1 star just for packaging.Save your time and money."
1,didn't work,"It did not supress my appatite, and I have had no results at all in the three weeks I have taken it (and I have been in taking it in conjunction with the DEX L10 Complete). I have actually gained weight."
5,Great in conjunction with South Beach Diet,"I bought this product but was a bit hesitant but thought I'd try it anyways. The first few days using it (not on South Beach Diet), I didn't notice much of a difference. I was still hungry but I'd get full faster. So, when I started SBD, it really helped. I'm on day 3 of the diet and I make sure I take 2 pills 1 hour before each meal and not only do I get full faster but I'm not hungry later.-----------Now done with a week of SBD and this product and am not hungry AND have lost 7 lbs in ONE WEEK.--------------I'll keep people posted after my first 2 weeks of Phase 1 in conjunction with the DEX-L10 are done."
3,One pill before meals not enough for me,"I have been taking just one pill before meals for several days as a test and have not felt any appetite suppressant effect yet. Since I am very succeptible to migraines, I thought I would try it slow at first. So far, I have had no ill side effects. I am going to step it up to 2 pills, three times a day and see if that keeps me full enough to sleep through the night - the worst part of dieting for me is insomnia.I heard on tv that Hoodia must be sucked on like a lollipop for maximum effect. Would appreciate someone comparing the pills versus the suckers before I buy the suckers."
3,"Pleased the toddler, but disappointed Mommy...","Based on the credits, it would seem the creators basically cobbled together a story using illustrations from the existing Mouse Cookies cookbook. Unfortunately, it shows. The writing - even for a toddler's book - is disappointing and disjointed. Like some other reviewers, I often embellish the story with missing details as I read it with my daughter. I was left with the feeling that the author struggled without the ""if you give a..."" formula that drives the plot of the original stories.That said, my two-year-old LOVES this book. We read it every night at her insistence, reviewing the charming pictures and a few favorite lines (""the higher the drop, the bigger the plop!""), and then she takes it to bed with her."
5,Great book,"We bought this book for our 2 1/2 year old son. He loves this book. In fact, we like most of the books in the ""If"" series of books. It is a sturdy book with great illustrations and a good plot."
3,Not as fun as the others,"I did buy this book thinking it was going to be like the other books in the series. My 2 year old and I were both disappointed. It is a cute book, but considering my daughter was already enjoying the longer books in the series, this one was just not as entertaining."
4,Seems Like A Good Series,"Tonight my four year old, Grace, asked me to read this book to her. The illustrations are cute, but there is a lot of white space. This does not bother Grace though. After reading Numeroff's book to her, she said, ""I like that book a lot."" My seven year old was on her bunk reading another book while I was reading The Best Mouse Cookie, but she managed to chuckle as I read this story to her younger sister. The story has a great ending - but the best cookie is the one you share with a friend. Just ask Mouse. My daughter Grace now wants to make a lot of cookies just like Mouse did."
1,something is wrong,I never bought this book I don't know why it is showing up. Hope you did not charge me for this please check your records.
4,GOO GONE-ALMOST,"Well this is the PRO version (don't bother with the other version it's a waste of money) of this product and I will give it credit for taking off just about everything is says. The reason we purchased it was because we bought a 100 year old house with beautiful wood flooring and found tar and glue from old linoleum on the kitchen floor. The Goo Gone does wonders for the tar with very little effort, but it won't do very much if anything for the hardened glue that is underneath this flooring. Technically the product does not boast about the removal of said hardened glue, but since it did mention glue we had hoped based on previous claims from other users of the product that it would work. We are glad we purchased it because it is a very nice smelling product and will save us a few dollars when it comes time to refinish our hardwood flooring. If it would take the glue off it would over a 1000+."
5,It is magic!,"We loooooooove goo gone, best invention ever. There is nothing nothing we have not found goo gone to remove safely and without damage to wood, glass, metal, wooden floor. You name it, we have tested it. And again again, it does the job and removes grease, tar like glue, rubber marks. Little elbow effort-terrific. This one is the liquid version, not the gel. Both works great. It is my little must have helper!"
2,In-house magazine,"The Flower Arranger is produced by NAFAS (the National Association of Flower Arranging Societies) in the UK and as such reflects the in-house nature of its contents. Unless you are 'in the know' you are left wondering what it is all about.The quality of the pictures of the arrangements are very mixed and although there have been recent alterations to the layout, the magazine itself is very stiff and formal. Any teaching or reference points tend to be very basic and seem to be aimed at beginners. Few references are made to up-to-date designs and, if there are, there are no real explanations about concepts.This is a magazine suitable for members of the organisation it represents and is very formal in nature."
1,"Months after ordering and paying, I STILL have not received my first copy of the magazine and am very disappointed.","Having not seen a copy after many months of waiting, I would not recomend the magazine to anyone. Send the magazine!"
5,We Flew Alone: United States Navy B-24 Squadrons,"The first thing, and most important to me, is that Mr. Carey has the facts! Good for a bet almost anywhere is the fact of the existence of US Navy B-24s and the Privateers during WWII.The reason I bought the book is that I'm researching my brother's service as a Naval aviator. On active duty during WWII and after, Allan W. Smith piloted PBYs and Privateers in the South Pacific. ""We Flew Alone"" has spurred me on in my efforts and provided ideas for further study.I enjoyed the book from cover to cover and recommend it to all WWII history buffs and aviators everywhere."
1,Bad Kindle Conversion - Don't Bother,For some reason this book has quite a bit of missing text. The biggest mystery is why other sources from the Gutenberg Project have the full stories along with the pictures and text that this version is missing. A really bad Kindle conversion.
3,Lost some pages,"There some pages are lost'I canot go through a whole story, but the folk story is really excting' I have a half"
4,A Solid Thriller With Great Characters!,"What does a Harvard grad school student, a remote order of priests, the C.I.A., a terrorist and a bible story have in common? Somehow Mark Olsen has managed to weave these components together into a great novel. I am afraid to tell more lest I give away the plot. You will not be disappointed."
1,"Disappointing, in a huge kind of way!","If Coolio reviewed this book it might sound a little like this...A little bit of highlander, all plot long; a little Frank Peretti, all plot long; a little wushu master, all plot long; a little too much Oprah in the end.As you can see by the number of stars I gave this book, you can tell I liked it only slightly more than I like Coolio."
5,What a great book!,"I just finished reading ""Assignment""--Wow! What a great read! Olson has combined suspense and mystery masterfully. He kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the book. The plot was creative, and drew me in until I felt as if I was actually there in the background, watching the story unfold. I highly recommend this book to any lover of suspense, mystery and intrigue. Great job, Mr Olson!"
5,Great read - hard to put down!,"This was such a wonderful book. I really had a hard time putting it down. Would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes Christian suspense. What a clever plot, too!"
5,Radical Wonderful Wild Bible!,Important. An Important book. A book that takes ancient mystical teachings and reveals their overwhelming relevance for today. Especially when our world is so busy making war...this book is busy making love...and shows that making love is not about having sex but about creating meaning and living passionately. If you thought that the Bible was boring or prudish - think again. Gafni - a Rabbi and mystical adept - gives the reader a treasured glimpse into the mystical Biblical tradition. His re-readings are radical but wonderfully footnoted; well-grounded and wildly mind expanding!
1,The worst written book award!,"This is one of the worst written and ill-conceived book. Author knows very little about current trends in information systems. An average well-informed reader would know more about information systems than the author without reading a single page of this book. Author's style is old school, orthodox and boring. Maybe his military background is making him approach everything in a disciplined way without curiously questioning how and why. No examples, no case studies discussed. Way too generic, confusing and useless work. I wasted my money as this was a textbook for the course I took in IT auditing. My suggestion to readers is to explore other references in IT auditing on amazon.Amazon is not allowing me to go lower than one star. I will give it a one star since it is 568 stupid pages bound between two paperboards! IT auditing is relatively a new field and this book is a bogus opportunistic attempt to cash on the new buzz word ""IT auditing""."
4,Music for children and adults alike..,"Am gonna say it in a few words: I always purchase sooner or later any compilation where Christian artists like Michael W Smith, Ginny Owens, Chris Rice, Sandi Patty, Geoff Moore, Amy Grant and others of the same vein give their personal and talented contribution to. Christians who not only sing about Jesus but who live the faith they profess, no matter the educational background they're from. This isn't music just for children, but for adults too. I would even say especially for adults... don't we all need to become like little children if we wanna enter the Kingdom of God someday? It's not about banal lullabies in here, it's about the love and tenderness parents cherish their loved little ones with. Now imagine the greatness and the dimension of God's love and tenderness in our regards, and you'll understand why I highly recommend this album to everyone. This project has only tried to make us savor a glimpse of God's eternal love for His creature: Us all..."
4,A Truly Soothing Set of Songs,"I found this collection of songs to be exactly what they were billed to be...lullabies that any parent would be happy to play for their children at bed time. Bobby and Kenny's rendition of ""Tis So Sweet"" was just that. As a mom of two sons I especially liked Kathy Lee Gifford's cut, ""Up to the Moon."" I believe that parent and child alike will be pleased with this CD."
5,Wonderful!,This album has quickly become our favorite in the nursery. It is both soothing and uplifting for me and my little one- I feel great having him listen to the message of songs letting him know how much he is loved by us and by God as he drifts off to sleep. The album is both well done and unique for kids. Simply terrific!
2,banal and naive,"mostly useless psychobabble with a few(very few) intellectually engaging moments. On another note, Mr. Grosbard perpetuates the myth that the Arabs were displaced en masse. Some were, but more were encouraged by their own arab countries to leave (thinking they'd win a big victory over Israel). In addition, Palestine was sparsely populated the Jewish pioneers who cultivated the then unusable land attracted Arabs. Most of today's refugees are not genuinely refugees. Some passages I even found offensive, like not calling a ""madman"" a madman because then we distance ourselves from him. I can still understand motives even if I label a madman a madman, a madman deserves the designation if its justified. Worth a chuckle or two that the author mentions the Jewish analog of a suicide bomber is...Samson! Now we can all relate!"
5,Savage,"Who can keep the pace, when the grandfather of punk rock starts rocking? Iggy Pop really lives savagely and dangerously. The whole range of the best of his best hits. My favorite songs are actually each one that is represented here, but especially I Wanna Be Your Dog"" (later taken over by Joan Jett), No Fun"" (later taken over by the Sex Pistols), China Girl"" (written with David Bowie who also made his own version of it), The Passenger"" (later taken over by Siouxsie & The Banshees) and Cry For Love"" (with Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols on guitar)."
3,Where's Down on the Street? Loose? T.V. Eye?,"Not a bad collection on the whole, but how can a cd without a single track from Funhouse be considered ""best of""?"
3,Good but hardly complete.,"Yeah, this is a good intro to the greatest talent of the second half of the 20th Century but for every essential song that's included I can name two that aren't. There is NOTHING from the ""Funhouse"" album. Why? Iggy still does ""loose"", ""TV eye"" and ""1970"". Why is the title track of ""Raw Power"" ommited? And there's a huge gap between 1977 and 86; none from his Arista LPs are represented (and ""five foot one"" is important). Others excluded: ""1969"", ""down on the street"", ""I got a right"", ""Johanna"", ""beside you"", his theme songs for ""Repo Man"" & ""Freddie's Dead"", and his live version of ""Louie Louie""."
3,could've been better,"This is the first Iggy Pop cd I've ever bought, and I love all of the songs on it. I've bought many more of his cds since then and I've gotta say that there could've been a better song selection. We all probably know that this should've been a 2 disk set and it should've featured at least ONE song from each of his cds. Since that wasn't fullfilled, I'm suprised they can give this cd the title ""The Best Of Iggy Pop"" and get away with it."
2,Overrated.,I never really saw what was so great about Iggy Pop.He was hyper and screamed. so what? So does my two year old son.
4,"Great album, so stop overpaying","Just a quick heads up to fans of this great song and album. The complete album plus some remixes are now available on iTunes for only $3.99. Get it now, before someone important changes their mind. Stop paying ridiculous amounts of money (that would include triple digits for the CD). I'm as capitalist as the next guy, but enough is enough. It's not like the sellers here are donating mass amounts of their profit to the cause. Peace.UPDATE JULY 2010: Sadly, it appears that the album has been removed from the ITMS. I'm not sure when this took place, but truly sad and frustrating for music fans everywhere."
3,A delightful little find...,"Ok, so, it's not smut. I was hoping for something a little dirtier than this, but there is not a single sex scene described in this book. That aside, it is still very interesting for insight into sexual politics and the strange, stilted, repressed English sensibility of the time. The girls are all catty, eloquent, and very very funny. Most of the sexuality is mentioned as subtext, and also the most entertaining details -- so you have to read the chattering dialogue slowly, but it's well worth it."
2,Buy The Singularity Is Near instead,"If you are interested in learning about the Spike / Singularity, you should buy Ray Kurzweil's book The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology. It has 10-20 times as much information / ideas. The Spike is practically unreadable because it is 90% fluff, 10% information."
2,Not Good,"This book is disappointing. I don't think Broderick understands the technology or its social impact, which is a major problem considering the book is an attempt to explain the causes, and effect on our lives, of ""the spike."" He quotes a lot of people who are smarter than he is and basically regurgitates their ideas without interesting analysis. And it's a lazy author who quotes paragraphs and long passages from articles and lectures instead of writing his own description and citing the source. Also, the author seems strangely arrogant for someone who almost gets it. He explains that everyone else calls nanotechnology ""nanotechnology or nano-tech, but I call it minting."" Hunh? Maybe everyone else calls this book good or interesting, but I call it boring (which, given the subject matter, it shouldn't be) and a waste of time for anyone who has thought about this stuff for more than a nanosecond. Or a minto-second. Or what I call speck-time."
2,A blurry view of the future,Broderick is at his best in quoting some of the scientists at the leading edge however he often fails to distinguish between the leading edge and the mere fringe. He is at his worst when he declares his own opinions. Much of what he thinks he knows simply isn't so. A little research might have helped.
3,Too sad stopped reading it,"I got to page 41, the stories were too sad. I wanted something lighter and up lifting. I know what it is to lose a beloved dog as I am sure all dog lovers know also. I just do not want to be reliving it again and again."
5,Truly Food for the Soul,"I found myself sometimes laughing and sometimes crying, but always being enthralled with the stories of man's best friend."
5,Great Book!,"This is a wonderful book, simply filled with heart warming stories about humans and dogs! It is recommended reading for all dog lovers!"
5,Great!!!,"Both my husband Al and myself are very happy with this book,we always enjoy the Chicken Soup for the Soul books."
3,Just think of it as a bootleg,"This isn't really an Alex Chilton album, but rather a peek into a not-so-successful attmept at trying to get something together to make a record. Obviously, Chilton is not at his sharpest, and doesn't have enough proper songs to do an album project. So what you get is some musicians probably drinking, injesting illegal substances, and having some fun. It doesn't sound like anyone is taking this too seriously. It sounds like a bootleg. Also, you can certainly tell some overdubbing has been done, but I've heard worse patch jobs. I haven't heard the original with no overdubbing, so I can't compare. I suppose the overdubbing was akin to adding sugar to vinegar to make it more pallatable. Why bother?"
3,you wont like this cd,"if you like the box tops, see above. if you love big star, see above. this is alex being sloppy and unfocused. 3 versions of take me home and make me like it are too much. the worlds worst version of i'm so tired. adding bangkok and cant seem to make you mine was a great idea. i cant knock this album anymore, i love it too much. theres an alex ad-lib that pretty much sums up this mess: ""richard, do you have any aspirin?"""
5,Good-Lookin' Mirror,Very pleased with the etched design of the mirror and overall look. It fit-in well with my home office decor.
3,A serious writer,"This is the only book I have read by Hanif Kureishi and I can say that he writes about serious issues in life, the kind that most people like to avoid because they are considered a taboo in our society. The book is composed of one long story and a couple of other short ones. The main story is about a married couple in which the wife is engaged in an extra marital affair and Kureishi has tried to analyze this problem that what makes married couples look elsewhere for happiness. I won't call it a sizzling story but it was a good timepass."
4,Beautiful cookbook for the more experienced or the daring!,"From the tv series, this is a collection of great recipes from great chefs.I say for the more seasoned gourmet, because there is not much included on technique or buying ingredients or prep, but just the recipe and a write-up on the chef.But for the adventuresome, there is much to be said for the recipes here --- very creative stuff with vivid color photos. Examples from Jasper White, Dean Feaaring, Stephen Pyles, Emeril Lagasse, Daniel Bouloud to mention but a few."
3,"Good, but not the whole season","This set was good, but I'm waiting for Paramount to release Andy Griffith on a per-season basis. I read that the entire Season 1 will be released October 12. The current Vol 1-4 set has some good episodes, but the quality of my set wasn't anything to write home about."
1,Waste of money,I bought these batteries and within one month both had quit working. Would not purchase again.
2,Batteries not good,I replaced the batteries in my digital clocks and one of them looks like this new battery only lasted a month.
5,LR43 batterties,"I could not find LR43 batteries locally, so I ordered thru Amazon. They arrived quickly and work like a charm."
5,Ramp Top Kit,This item was exactly as described. I purchased so I could put a riding lawnmower in my pick up. Kit arrived. I bought two 2 x 8's and assembled it in 10 minutes and was in business.
3,almost perfect,"wish it could have holes for 6"" boards. i know it's 8"" item, but why not have 2 holes that would line up for 6"" boards? i know i can put some in there, but why do it?anyway, there is a ""c"" channel lip and i thought the board's end has to snugly fit in there. but it does not. it just butts up to it, which makes it look weird.the two bolts are a little short. but works.nice product. strong. i'd buy it again."
2,Watch Your Weight,"Bought these to go with some board ramps I intended to use to load a riding mower onto a 3/4 ton pick-up. Turns out to meet the angle I would need to get the mower on the truck, the boards would have to be too long and wouldn't support the mower's weight. As a result, these suckers went back and I bought premanufactured aluminum ramps. Much better and safer, I think."
2,Does not match description,"These ramp tops are about 8x8 inches, and the ""pre-formed"" mating notch will not fit standard 1.5 inch lumber. notch measures about 1.25 inches. Going back!"
2,public finance and public policy in the new century,This book while focused on public finance dips somewhat into sociology and needs to maintain a focus on public finance and the policies that result.
4,local teacher saved by lawyer,lawyer saves death row inmate with guile and determination. well written for laymen to explain how a movie and writer can sway opinion and police corruption exists that can overturn a verdict in the Supreme Court of Pa.
4,Brendan Behan Is A Very Funny Man.,"HOLD YOUR HOUR AND HAVE ANOTHER is actually a collection of short articles written by Behan for THE IRISH PRESS. Many describe incidents from his own life. Some take place in pubs. My favorite is entitled ""The Hot Malt Man and the Bores.""Behan is a very funny man amd the illustrations by Beatrice Behan add even more humor to this rather short but thoroughly enjoyable book."
3,"Great Effort, But Lacks In Keeping Your Attention","Celebrating the diverse, but surprisingly solid catalogue of Pluto Records is The Deadly with their latest effort, The Wolves Are Here Again. The Deadly is the sort of genre bending band that is all to lacking in modern day music. The Deadly combines good old driving rock n' roll with almost screamo vocals, taking the unsuspecting listener back upon first listen.(...)The only problem with the album is it all sounds remotely the same and eventually kind of drones together about 3/4s of the way through the album. On a whole, The Deadly have done a great job at putting their own twist on the album and creating a listenable album."
5,A unique opportunity inside the After-Hours world of Tatum,"Throughout this series of releases of Art Tatum's live recordings, which included performances in clubs, radio broadcasts, TV appearances, we heard a different side of Tatum than his recordings for Decca, Capitol, Clef, etc.This release is a totally different document. For over half of the CD, we hear home recordings of Tatum in an After-Hours club. He is totally relaxed, among friends, and is heard talking and singing! The second version of If You Hadn't Gone Away, and Aunt Hagar's Blues are alone worth the price of the CD!Other gems are included in this CD, including recording from his home, on his Steinway. Also, there is a duo recording with Slam Stewart (their only time without a guitarist).I wish there were more material like this. Regretably, this may be the last volume in this series of wonderful releases. Enjoy this while it is available."
4,The only good one in the whole box set,"I bought the entire Street Biker box set. It included: Chain Reaction, Xtreme Biker 1&2, and this one. As the others have short running times and are dull, I will only recommend this one. SoCal riders made a good video and its fun to watch several times."
4,Very solid introduction,"Mid-period Munro, when she began in earnest to explore a talent for expansiveness. The title story is as fine as anything she's written. The final pages reap deliciously what the story's juxtaposed timelines and plots have set up. You walk away from the story shaking your head, sighing, aching. Not as fine a collection as The Moons of Jupiter, also out of the same period in her career, but still hard to beat by another writer in the medium. It seems short stories have waited for Munro for too long, and we are too privileged to be readers in her lifetime."
4,master of the genre,"The stories in ""Progress of Love"" are quite long - about 30 pages each and demand time and attention by the reader. They often open in a tangential fashion and it is not until you are some way in the story you realize what or who the main subject is. The author is interested in relationships, especially couples and children and in a few sentences of observation or dialog conveys much meaning. Still these stories are not for everyone - there is a certain coldness about them, or maybe its the characters she portrays. You will have to read it yourself to judge. There is a longer review of this books and several others on my cultural blog which I invite you to visit and leave comments on - the link is in my profile."
2,jluporto,"I thought that this product was below standards. When washing the cover I noticed that there was a small hole which did not release the water that was there after washing. Other Coleman products that I have purchased in the past didn't have that. The product was inferior. The material was inferior very cheap plastic, not like the one that I purchased 10 years ago, which I still have. The reason for the purchase was that the handle was broken on the old one, but I managed to fix it and are still using this as of today 9/29/08. The other one that I just purchased will just sit there until the old one just fades away."
4,Classic Mintzberg!,Good choice for those who want to learn about management and the design of successful organizations.
4,"Great deal, very good picture","I purchased this TV online after returning a 42"" Samsung DLP with the ""black grass"" problem (ALL Samsung HL-S4266W 42"" DLP TVs have that problem). The SONY was delivered much faster than expected, and arrived in great shape. The delivery man (EGL) stayed until the TV was set up and turned on to check for proper operation.This TV has a wonderful picture. It can be made even better by setting it up per the professional calibration settings attained online at LCD TV Buying Guide. Once done, the picture is bright and clear, even on non-HD materials (SD TV). DVDs, even at 480P look wonderful, almost as good as HD. My only ""nit"" is that compared to the best of plasma TVs (Panasonic), the black levels leave a little to be desired. Don't get me wrong, the black levels are very good, just not that deep ""ink"" black that is attainable with CRT and top level plasma TVs.Highly recommended, and its a SONY!!! 4 1/2 stars."
5,Great LCD,"I got this TV to replace a defective plasma. Although you cant beat the picture quality of a plasma, this TV comes pretty close. Plus there no 100s of hours of break in or worries of burn-in or image retention.Picture quality for HD content is great. Standard def is okay (at least as good as the plasma was). DVDs look better than SD but not nearly as good as HD (I'm looking forward to HD DVD). My xbox 360 looks fantastic (no ghosting or image blur at all).I've had this TV for over a month now and dont regret it at all. I would reccomend it to anyone."
1,Standby Problem,"I purchased the KDL 46xbr2 model in August; now 95 days later it is in standby mode. The expensive paper weight will not stay on; it automatically turns off after a second. I call SONY, they referred me to a local ""authorized servicer"" who won't return my calls. I called the place I purchase the tv, they say they can't help me--this is SOUND ADVICE--notHowever, when the TV did work it was great.....now I am stuck with I heck of an expensive paper weight.any suggestions?"
4,Good but not great,Good picture - but not great for the money. Especially in 480i mode. It does have a lot of connection options which is a plus. Overall not a bad TV but I expected more from Sony. Basic but functional remote - I replaced it with a Logitech Harmony 880 - much better.If someone offers you one for free - take it - otherwise shop around. There are better and cheaper TVs.
5,Great TV,"I had been looking for a big screen that was a great value. This one certainly fit the bill. While not the cheapest on the market, I feel like it is one of the best values for the money. Picture is incredible and NO GLARE!!! If you've ever watched big screens of the past, then you know what I mean! I am on satellite tv and have the HD package and there is nothing much more to say other than WOW when viewing HD programming. Overall, just a great tv. I have recommended and others have already bought it and they feel the same way I do. I would highly recommend to others, as well."
5,Great,This is a great model. No issues what so ever with it. It is very detailed down to some smaller levels.
2,It's friggin tiny!,"For all of you looking for a bargain on a gundam model, this ain't it. It had been a while since i had last bought one of these, so at first i thought my hands had just gotten bigger. But 3 hours later as i got to the halfway point i realized what i was building wasn't a model, it was a figurine! I had to put the stickers on with a damn toothpick! I finally compared it to an older model i had and foun it half (if not a third) the size.More frustration for less reward. If u want a gundam, shell out the extra thirty bucks for a full size and save your self 7 terrible hours."
3,NOT written by Sarah Ban Breathnach,I ordered this book thinking it was written by Sarah BB -AND- Barrie Dolnick as indicated on the top of the amazon page. When the book arrived today I find that Sarah contributed TWO pages only. Disappointing. I love Sarah's books. I am keeping it anyway since it is a bargain book but amazon really should change their page.
2,Instructions for Discontent,Didn't help. I passed the book to a friend and she had the same review. A lot of the advice was common sense.
5,The book was very fast-paced and invigorating.,"After, I got over my preconceived notions about the book after I read the title, I rather enjoyed the book. The characters in the book were unlike others I've read because they seem to mesh together quite nicely right from the beginning. I didn't have to read have way throught the book to find out if they liked each other enough to do a real serious kissing scene. I believe Nora Roberts is a great writer and I wished that she had been more careful about choosing the title of this book."
5,I like Nora Roberts and the way she writes.,She is one of the best authors I have read and she keeps my interest up in all the books and keeps me in suspense.
5,Great book fun read lots of twists,"Five stars all the way Chantal was a realistic person fun read , I can't wait to read an other in the series."
3,Entertaining,"It's a nice formula read with good girl needs help, bad boy is available and things good girl is a snob but finds out she has a heart. Nice writing and kept me entertained for a while."
4,Brings back memories,"I bought this for my mom as a ""gag"" gift. We used to have a motioned sensored Douglas Fir. We also had 4 cats. She got so annoyed with that thing so I had to get this.It's a sing-a-long with a CD included. It's very cute. I think I enjoy it just as much as my mom does. I'm 18 and I still enjoy singing along with these goofy things. Now we don't have to worry about cats turning this on at 2 in the morning."
4,BW goes CW,"The combination of these two original vinyl albums on one CD is a real treat. Bobby Womack is truly a great soul artist, and both these albums have some great recordings. Womack is one of the few musicians who can blend soul and country music in an authentic way. Add to this the fact that he is a masterful singer and the result is a CD that begs to be heard by a wider audience. Ironically this has been Womack's biggest problem. He is such a ""natural"" musician that whenever he tries to go commercial it fails completely. He may not have got the big bucks like those he influenced(ie The Stones!)but I am sure his fans appreciate the great music he has given us over the years. Those who like him, like him alot."
4,Amusing but no plot,Frank and his mother live with various aunts/uncles. There is no plot and is mostly told from the viewpoint of the mother and Frank. It is written very well and some parts are funny. I would rather have a plot.
2,Silly Lin Carter exegesis on Lovecraft,"As usual for the Chaosium series, editor Price gushes academically about minor entries in the Lovecraftian Derby, and it's never more evident than in this collection of Lin Carter's mythos tales. Carter was a supremely talented editor and a good heroic fantasy writer (I love his Throngor novels) but his mythos writing falls prey to juvenile adoration and extremely flimsy plotting. Price's attempts to defend Carter's over-categorization of the mythos merely exacerbates the silliness of most of Carter's work. Interesting for mythos completists, but newcomers should seek other books in this series that deal with multiple authors (highly recommended: ""The Hastur Cycle"" and ""The Nyarlathotep Cycle"")."
2,Very misleading description.,"The authors description of this book is very misleading. I did not even finish the last 1/3 of the book because it was so boring. I did not laugh once and all the ten things to do are things like "" be kind to others and yourself""."
2,Nuns have more fun,"This book is more like a ""rule of life"" than suggestions for specific fun things to do, like going skydiving or riding the world's biggest roller coaster. Of course, calling it a ""rule of life"" wouldn't be much fun, now, would it? Among all the frivolity (not that there's anything wrong with frivolity) she slips in a few ideas that could be construed as spiritual disciplines. Very clever, this nun! She might be a fun person to take to the clubs and discos, but only after her periods of silent meditation.I really wanted to give this book at least three stars, but I had to dock it one star due to her constant references to ""the Gods"" or ""the Gods and their Muses"". Just to whom the heck is she referring? Fun is fun, but I would expect a nun to at least be a monotheist."
1,More pagan claptrap,"Someone's dreams are coming true when you read this, and it won't be yours. It'll be the woman who wrote this silly pagan mess in the first place. This book is not aimed at Catholics or serious protestant Christians - it is aimed at the bland, cynical post modern reader (in this case female, with a disordered fascination for witchcraft) who quickly snaps up Oprah's next book club selection. That a nun would write this is painful. That it would be proudly published is shameful."
2,Borborygmi,"Throughout these compositions a slow progression of electronic droning creates a static field of suspension. Interesting? Using muted violin and synthesizer both CDs have this quiet pensive droning. To quiet to appreciate any undertones nor nuances. Gentle musings or microchip borborygmi? Whatever the artist's intent it all comes across as synthesized oatmeal. Credits are given to violin, bass, trombones, but they are all but indiscernable. This is an eclectic electronic ambient project."
4,Lies? Yes. But That's The Point,"Of course this book of full of lies, but that is what makes it so great. If you are reading this book through the eyes of a historian, and can't get past the lies, your eyes aren't open all the way. Stanley's ""Through the Dark Continent"" shows us the European idealogy of African colonization. All his lies are not produced simply for the purpose of lying, or hiding the truth. He lies to give Europe what it wants: a perfect arena for the civilizing mission. These savages that throw themselves at the feet of Stanley are perfect for conversion. This book helped propel imperialization in its own time, and now shows us how they did such.When reading this book, use your knowledge of Stanley's deception to get in the mind frame of a late 19th century explorer, not just to experience the adventures; that is the true joy of reading primary sources."
4,"In Conversation with God, wonderful reading!","If you want to get an easy way to do mental prayer, just read the meditation of each day of the year contained in this wonderful and most complete 7 book collection, titled In Conversation with God. Truly, I can assure you that, after using it for a lifetime, it will benefit you greatly.This can be life changing."
5,GREAT!,This set is a timeless classic. I'd hate to begin to describe it in words. The meditations are based on the Daily Readings from the Mass. It offers excellent insights for anyone who's serious about deepening their faith and tranforming everyday life into prayer and growing in holiness. You'll be in sync with the Church's liturgical year and you'll gain an in-depth knowlegde of Church's teaching and virtue. I've used it for 3 years now and I HIGHLY recommend it.
5,Beautiful books...,"These books are exquisite; the small size fits easily in the hands or a purse and the clear, simple writing style makes the messages easy to assimilate. Wish I had bought a set ages ago."
1,Condemns Non-Catholics/Ex-Catholics,"Unfortunately, the author falls into habit of assuming he knows the mind of God when it comes to the salvation of non-Catholics and equates not being Catholic or having left the Catholic Church for another Christian denomination as persecuting and hating Christ.This is not for any but like-minded Catholics who firmly believe that there is no salvation outside the Catholic Church and that all non-Catholics are going to hell."
5,Fire Ant Killer,I can't believe I cannot find it in Walmart or Home Depot. It works so well. You just sprinkle a small amount on the mound and the ants are gone!
1,Does not kill the mound,I have made repeated applications to my mound of fire ants. It kills the ants I see but does not kill the mound.
1,Waste of money,"I've used nearly a whole container of this product and it does not kill the fire ants. They will abandon the treated mound, but rebuild just a few feet away. Hot water is much more effective and a lot cheaper."
4,Season 3 starts strong,"These four episodes get the third season off to a strong start. There will be some major shake-ups in the supporting cast and some important story arcs will gain momentum. We get the resolution of the second season cliffhanger, in which Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black) was killed and Crichton (Ben Browder)was left lying on an operating table with the top of his head removed. The dalliance between Chiana (Gigi Edgely) and Jothee (Matthew Newton), son of D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), is resolved as well. The first of the big changes comes in the two-part ""Would'A, Could'A, Should'A,"" which has an overly complex plot but some powerful character dynamics and an effective farewell for a beloved cast member."
2,No Closed Captions-Boring,"Amazon shows that this DVD has closed caprions. It does not. I have received many DVDs Amazon states has closed captions that do not- hearing impaired people be warned.My family (we are history buffs) thought that the DVD was not well made, boring, and therefore never completed watching it. So I would have to say it was a waste of money."
4,"Rome, Capital of the World","Julius Caesar's Rome, a two-DVD set, carries its audience back to Ancient Rome, a civilization that was born in 753 BCE on the banks of the river Tiber in modern Italy and ended with the fall of Constantinople in modern Turkey in 1453 CE.The first DVD narrates the life of Julius Caesar, Anthony, and Cleopatra. The narration of the life of both Anthony and Cleopatra is too long due to some lousy acting that history lovers should have been spared.The second DVD starts with the legendary foundation of Rome in 753 BCE and ends with the reign of Justinian, the great emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in the 6th century CE. The second DVD is an invitation to further explore the glorious past of Rome and its relevance to our western society.The photography in both DVDs is usually compelling, the interviews with leading archaeologists are most often interesting, and the narration of Joe Mantegna is to-the-point and accessible."
2,....deceptive packaging???,"I am a real Roman Empire History buff and was jazzed at the idea of a new video documentary on the topic. There are two discs. The first includes the Julius Caesar bio and the story of Antony and Cleopatra. They aren't bad despite the fact the latter is given a bit of ""hollywood treatment"". I guess it's the History Channel getting ready for prime time. It's the second disk I have a problem with. It uses the programs from the Discovery Channel Documentary distributed by Questar Video afew years ago. That's four of the six programs in the set. So if you own the Questar set, like I do, you already have these programs. The History Channel set gives no indication of the prior packaging under Questar. That's a bit deceptive in my opinion. Be warned!!"
2,Really lame,"As a fan of Wegman and Fay, I was hoping this would be as amusing as Alphabet Soup, but no, it's tedious. Normally the 12 days of Christmas refer to the day itself plus those following ( think five gold rings, four mockingbirds, etc) but this video charts the dogs' activities leading up to Christmas. Even our 7-year-old was bored. Not recommended."
3,"Good natured silly fun, but not 5 stars","OK, once you get past the first few minutes the laffs wear off. Its mildly amusing, but, really, I cannot see why people think this is so funny. If you haven't seen it yet, I won't give the punch line away, but it wears thin pretty quick. Add a star if you are a dog lover and you have a really, really dry sense of humor, like Sahara dry."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this book to help me identify unknown plants in an overgrown garden. There is only one photograph in the book, only hand-drawn pictures which are not very helpful. The identifications are made with verbal descriptions that can be very confusing and ambiguous. If your requirement is scientific this book may be helpful, but if identification is your goal I would definitely not recommend this book. Definitely not worth 49.95..."
3,"A solid, mixed genre album","First, and foremost, this is NOT a 'breaks' album. Nor is this a 'progressive house' album. What this is, is a nice collection of varying styles and genres. It's well-polished, and a good listen. I can't be too emphatic, because I have grown accustomed to Hyper's past -- dirty breaks, thumping stuttering baselines, and lots of crunch. However, Hyper's tendency towards melody shines on this album. This is a better album than Junkie XL's new effort, and I liked it better overall than Meat Katie's latest. I think this is well worth a purchase for some ""pop breaks"", a-la JXL's ""Computer Hell""."
3,Not bad...,"I really enjoy a few of the tracks on this album such as ""We Control"" and ""Morning"" and the others aren't bad if you like this style of Techno. Each song has something unique and stylish in it, but remain pretty simple and won't suck you in for very long. I wouldn't buy this album unless it was dirt cheap."
1,Garbage,"This ""Nigon"" guy obviously doesn't have a clue, go back to your ""Back Seat Boys"" & ""Brittany Spears"" dude. Me personally I like pre-packaged drum beats & as far as people who don't, there's plenty other music out there they can listen to; they don't have to come along and ruin mine. Thanks, but no thanks ""Nigon"" you've done the wolrd of dance a dis-service. This album blows and ""Jbizzle"" is absolutely correct, what an insult. To anyone else reading, this album's truely is awful, the only people, and I mean the ONLY people who'll like this are the Pop wannabes who don't have a clue about music outside the top 20 & TRL."
1,not accurate,"This movie is a terrible way to ""honor"" such a great book. In the movie you do not see the symbolism, and it is not true to the text at all. In the movie Dimmsdale doesn't die as he is supposed to in the novel. How could someone take such a good movie and make it into Demi Moore trash???? If you want to know about the scarlet letter i am sure has a great copy of the BOOK for sale. Trust me it is 100% better."
5,A Worthy Movie,"This movie gives a great depiction of the harsh Puritan laws in the 1700s that kept unlawful love a great sin. I saw the movie right after I read the book (so it was fresh in my mind). It embodies the spirit of the book by Nathaniel Hawthorne. I've greatly enjoyed reading this book and watching this movie. It's not trite like I always suspected. In case you're a audio and visual person, and not a lover of books as I, watch this movie for a fair look into Nathaniel Hawthorne's purpose."
2,Sound quality poor,Though the version was acurate to the text the sound quality of The Scarlet Letter was very poor. Should I return the DVD ?
2,Great movie. Music unavailable,"This made-for-tv movie is quite faithful to the book. I have the DVD.How nice it would be for PBS & WGBH Boston to catch up with the modern era and make their backlog of music scores available for purchase as mp3's. I would love to her the ominous symphonic piece they write for this as an mp3. Sadly, they just don't seem to get that they are sitting on a catalog of existing materials they could be making money from. PBS is old guard all the way.The movie also deserves a better DVD than this, which interrupts the narrative to emulate how it aired on tv twelve million years ago."
2,"I beg to Differ, But . . .","True, Hawthorne's novel deserves a full-out treatment, but not one as plodding and slow as this. We all know the complexities of the novel - we are not reviewing that, but rather a version that is at least an 1 1/2 hours too long. The pacing is deadly, the set - a view of Boston in 1650 - looks like Peabody in 1625. 14 people gather around Hester after her 9 foot walk to the public scaffold. The whole production seems smallish.And I'm sorry, but Meg Foster's eyes are so weirdly other-worldish that I couldn't concentrate on much else.This production gets a Scarlet C-."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz............................,"When the movie stopped, I automatically woke up. I'm a 16 year old student, and I just want to say that this movie was just painful to sit through. The camera quality was remarkably cheap. Meg Foster's eyes had no color, they looked like white marbles in her head. That was just freaky. Kevin Conway didn't do to bad, he's a great actor (just watch him in Gettysburg), but you couldn't really understand what he was saying. The movie was true to the book, which may be why it was so bad. The music was unsettling, even kind of satanic sounding. Oh well. At least I'll never have to watch it again."
4,Help students visualize,"Though there are some differences between the novel and this version of the movie, they are minor and do not interfere with meaning. My students were discussing character development, viewing scenes from the movie helped them see the characters as more than words on paper."
4,Authentic Scarlet Letter,This film is one of the best I have ever seen. I taught the Scarlet Letter for over 15 years. This film is as close to the book as any I know of and the characters very acurately portrayed. Narration from the book to contextualize scenes adds to its veracity. My students found the portrayal intriguing and were very attentive. Another feature which is worthwhile is treatment of material from the Custom House Introduction without the tedium of the written one.
1,The Tenement,"Don't purchase this movie. It looks as if it was shot with a hand-held videocam; the acting is ""cheesy.""In total honesty, someone shot this in their basement, using a few different scenes and backgrounds. I NEVER even finished watching the movie, it was so awful.Save your hard-earned cash on this one!"
5,Slightly Dangerous - Starring Lana Turner,"FINALLY - This film has come out on DVD! I've waited years for this day. In the interim, I had purchased a 'boot leg' copy that was completely unaccepable. This is my MUST HAVE Lana Turner film. If you haven't seen this film before, you're in for a treat. I wish that I could see it myself again for the first time. No one, who adores Lana Turner films, will be disappointed with this film. My only wish is that at some point it will be released in blu-ray. ENJOY!"
4,sexy Lana,"Many female actress hairdos of the forties and fifties seemed aimed at destroying sex appeal. Look at most of Lana's flicks after her very earliest to see that she was a typical victim. Slightly Dangerous is one of her early ones so Lana's youthful attractiveness is allowed to express itself. Even better, though it is a light comedy and Garbo had already played a similar though more dramatic role, Slightly Dangerous has its clever moments, is very entertaining, and has a feel-good ending. Nothing tops her performance in The Postman Always Rings Twice, though. In that one, Lana is as close as she ever comes to being an actress, and she is incredibly sexy."
4,funny and cleaver,"This films stars Lana Turner, who even after winning an award for always being on time, is not happy with her job. A soda jerk who can even make a banana split blindfolded, writes a letter saying her life is over. She does a complete makeover on her self, new hair, new clothes, new name. She looks up lost people, missing for years and takes over as the missing person. After convincing everyone she is that person all goes well until...Until what you ask? buy the film and see.Keeps you laughing. Fine cast makes the film worth seeing."
4,Classic screwball,"This is a late screwball comedy that can hold its own against a great many of the genre classics. It's Lana Turner's best film, and Robert Young was perfectly cast. Special credit should go to Pandro Berman for bringing out yet another first class film. By the way, compare Turner here with the later Marilyn Monroe. Their approach to acting is similar, and both were, of course, stunning beauties. But it's no contest on film; Turner is far more talented and capable."
4,A moving portrayal of a Cherokee folk hero.,"What a shame that this gem of a book never received the undeserved attention bestowed upon Larry McMurty's & Diana Ossana'a monstrosity (that shall go un-named here). Conley's account of Ned Christie's experience with white man's law tells the story of a thoughtful and respected Cherokee leader who made the best of an impossible situation by letting his enemies ""know that they had been in a fight."""
5,Great gift for a serviceman!,I bought this for my brother who is a Marine Sniper. He was blown away by the accuracy and detail.
3,Not for the real fan of horror movies,If you are a long time fan of horror movies you will be disappointed in this one since it is very predictable from start to finish.Special effects and film quality do not match up to the brand name.OK for first time viewers of horror films but not for old-timers like me who are fans of imported horror films.
2,Not recommended,"This tape has metric on one edge, imperial on the other. Unless you are working in both systems, and both AT THE SAME TIME, you will not like this tape. In fact, even if you do work in both, you probably won't. When you flip the tape over to measure from the other direction (like when find the dead center of an opening) the scale you need is now facing away from you - and the hash marks don't come all the way across the tape. You have to sort of guess at it."
5,classic songstress,"I MUST HAVE WAITED YEARS TO FINALLY SEE TWO OF NANCY WILSON'S MOST POPULAR LP'S FROM THE 60'S REISSUED ON C.D.""BROADWAY-MY WAY "" AND ""HOLLYWOOD-MY WAY"" WERE TO MY MEMORY AS A SMALL CHILD COMMON KNOWLEDGE IN OUR SOCIETY.THE SONG'S ARE FRESH REMINDER'S OF WHAT A TRUE VOCALIST CAN DO WITH ANYTHING PRESENTED THEM,AND IN THE 60'S NANCY WILSON WAS INDEED THAT VOICE.""DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES"",""MOON RIVER"",""DEARLY BELOVED"",""SECRET LOVE"",""GETTING TO KNOW YOU"",""WHEN DID YOU LEAVE HEAVEN"",AND""A LOT OF LIVIN'TO DO"" ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES AS TO THE GENIUS OF NANCY THAT STILL CAST A SPELL ON THOSE WHO LISTEN FOR THE FIRST TIME,EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T BORN WHEN SHE MASTERED HER ARTISTRY ON THIS CLASSIC LP'S IN 1963 AND'64.IT'S AN IMPORT FOLKS AND THE PRICE IS REASONABLE SO SNAP IT UP WHILE THE GETTING'S GOOD"
5,Very good Help,"Getting the information for the newest exams for A+ is certainly paramount to any person wanting to advance in the IT industry and making sure the information will help you pass is another major concern. So when Osborne put together this package I was pleasantly surprised to find the both exams are covered with more than enough information.The first book is the major resource for passing both exams. It is broken down into 2 sections, Core hardware and Operating Systems Technologies. The book has ever 200 questions in the book and over 200 questions on the cd-rom. The cd-rom also includes a CBT simulator for even more help.The other book included in this package is the A+ Test Yourself, with over 200 questions broken down into the two exams. Both books also include practice tests for each exam.Overall the two-book combination makes one of the best set of study material out there today."
3,Doesn't cover all subjects!,I recently passed my A+ test. There were several questions on the exam that were not covered in the book. I don't recommend this book for people that are weak on this subject.
3,freely available,"This is a reprint of a copyright-expired book that originally appeared in 1907. If you do a bit of searching you can find the full text online. But if you prefer to have a nicely-printed paper copy, this is a good option. Personally I made more progress with ""Step By Step in Esperanto"" by Montagu Butler, which is sometimes available used here on Amazon. ""Step By Step"" divides the material into many small lessons that you can pick up and read during idle moments."
2,Didn't fit 85 Toyota Celica Supra,"While I'm sure these are good brake rotors, the did NOT fit the 85 Toyota Celica Supra we tried to install them on. Amazon says that they will fit, but it is wrong - still.We returned them promptly, and received a full refund."
5,A finely written record of an oral tradition revived.,"Something that is slowly vanishing, as the country progresses, Kunzang Choden has grabbed the truth of it and recorded it splendidly before it fades away. Culture. Tradition. The passing down. What was once done orally,the indigenous folktales of Bhutan as the author remembered them told in her childhood are offered to us with an array of humorous, touching, pleasing stories. Apparently the author realized that the stories were starting to be replaced by modern technology. In doing so, so much was lost. Here she takes us on a rich journey through her country, and it's fading folktales that she has vividly bought back to life. And for those who want to know more about this country, this book would be even more recommended."
5,Great workout!,"After the first time doing this, my arms and upper body were sore for 2 days! This tape works muscles I didn't even know I had. Suzanne's yoga syle of exercise is very relaxing too. After the workout, you'll feel refreshed and energized. Pair this tape with another BalanceBall workout, and you'll have a great hour of exercise."
5,A Wonderful & Creative Idea on Workout!,"It combines yoga & pilates by using just a ball which in turn is loved by my 5-month old boy. It's creative & helps create awareness in movements. Unlike weight-training, this ball-exercise is more interesting & efficient. Bravo!"
4,Balance Ball Fitness- Upper Body,"I like this program a lot. It is a challenge, but doable. I would recommend getting the lower body workout as well."
4,A tight fit,"The pedals look awesome. They feel good and offer support. They are rather large, which provide a tight fit. I am a little concerned about the brake and gas pedal Being close together. The items shipped fast and item was as described."
4,Great book to read,I purchased this book solely based on the title & enjoyed every page. It was an attention getter. Couldn't put the book down.
3,Only for diehard Moon Lay Hidden fans (all 12 of us),"If Swans made music in medieval Europe, you'd have The Moon Lay Hidden Beneath a Cloud. Scary anthems of madness among royalty, disease and war among the peasants. Many of these songs are rooted in historical fact, which makes them all the more disutrbing.This 3-track cd is sort of an indulgence for TMLHBAC (I'll get carpal tunnel syndrome if I type their name out every stinkin' time). Albin Julius (now Der Blutharsch) and singer Alzbeth were impressed with Deutsch Nepal's twisted ambient stuff, so they collaborated.Alzbeth's voice is intriguing as always; the soundscapes, not so much. This side project isn't as forceful as a straight-up Moon Lay Hidden album given the absence of a historical theme and full instrumentation. One of the three (looooooong) songs is danceable, and all three have minimal arrangement. Check out ""Rest on Your Arms Reversed,"" a much better introduction (retrospective) to TMLHBAC."
2,Not sure,"I haven't been able to watch this all the way through yet, I started to & gave it about 5-10 minutes, the instruction & speech on it is hard to understand. I have the Viniyoga Therapy one by Gary Kraftsow & it's excellent. I also purchased from a different source, Stress Relief Yoga for beginners by Suzanne Deason & use that one 3 times a week & have for over a year & half."
1,Do Not Purchase,"This item should not be sold any longer. Many of the places to stay listed in this book no longer exist. Do not purchase this book. It needs to be ""put to rest""."
5,Brief Stays in Heaven,"We planned our honeymoon out of this book, and boy am I glad that we did. The places in here are all splurges, but it's money well spent. Jacuzzis, balconies, and all sorts of romantic touches. This book never steered us wrong. Plus it's a delight just to look at the photos, and dream of trying more spots."
2,Strange and Silly: A Warning,"I ordered this thinking it was something like Bowie's PIN UPS elpee, i.e., Elton and the band doing a bunch of his favorite songs from when he was getting started.Not so.Perhaps you are familiar with the practice of knocking off a bunch of clone-cover versions of current popular hits, and putting them out as a party album? It would appear that EJ participated in a few of these projects during his early days, and this album is the result of collecting a number of such tracks on which EJ sang. I have no clue whether he played piano on any of them, but have my doubts.It's amusing, entertaining in places, but not by any means a real Elton John album.WARNING: I found that it would not play in either my or my wife's car stereo, though it plays at home just fine."
4,Swell Set of Covers,"Back in 1969 and 1970, the early days of Elton John's career, he performed covers of then-current pop hits as appeared on K-Tel and ""Top of the Pops"" albums. The good news is that the former Reg Dwight put as much heart, enthusiasm, and talent into his remakes of others' work as he does into his own work. I especially enjoyed his versions of ""United We Stand"" (who *is* that terrific girl singer performing with him?), ""Spirit In The Sky,"" and ""Signed Sealed Delivered."" CHARTBUSTERS GO POP is an infectiously fun, boppy, entertaining album that anyone who loves Elton John or late '60s/early '70s music would be happy to own -- even if the one I got didn't have a cute girl on the cover! :-)"
4,The era Elton Forgets,"Back in the Reg Dwight Days, it was common play for ""sound-alike"" albums to be released in the late 60's and early 70's. I remember having a few on the Pickwick label. Even though Sir Elton doesn't ever talk about doing these tracks, they are a hoot! The quality is surprisingly good, although there are many labels that put this out. I have the one with this cover and it's on RPM International, which is under Pickwick. Some of the tracks don't sound like Elton but there are definitly some great tracks with Elton doing his best at these covers. Best tracks for me were Badfinger's ""Come And Get It"", Cat Stevens' ""Lady D'Arbanville"", The Beach Boys version of ""Cottonfields"" and ""My Baby Loves Lovin'"" could pass as an early track like his own ""I've Been Loving You"". If you are an Elton fan like me, this is a must! I took a star away because I doubt that ALL songs are Elton singing."
4,Works,"Works. But, you can't see if the water level is ok. You may want to get a squirt bottle with a long tube to fill the cup"
5,Intex Filters 6-Pack,This is the ONLY way to go when buying these filters. Much cheaper by the 6-pack than buying them individually or two to a pack at WalMart. We rinse the filters regularly to make them go as long as they can.
4,beautiful but tricky to install,"Baldwin prides itself on the high quality of its products and rightly so. However, if you are used to the five minute installation of a Kwikset or Schlage passage lock, think again. This product demands you read the instructions (wear your reading glasses) to get it right."
5,Import Is One of MANCINIs BEST PANTHER Soundtracks,"This import of Henry Mancini's soundtrack to THE PINK PANTHER is one of the best soundtracks to be issued from THE PINK PANTHER film series. This soundtrack captures a lot of source music that was certainly in vogue and has captured that tantalizing cocktail jet set quality in the numerous compositions especially in IT HAD BETTER BE TONIGHT. THE PINK PANTHER theme is an endearing and enduring melody that has become instantly identifiable with both the cartoon character and the film series. The gifted Henry Mancini not only composed great and endearing songs and melodies but was also an exceptional and somewhat unrecognized composer when it came to scoring a film. Track 13 - Return of the Pink Panther, Pts. 1-2 is a very good background composition unfolding the caper of that outing and is included here. Great packaging concept too!"
3,Another gem from 1980,"""He Can't Love You"" is another gem that will forever send me back to 1980. MSB had a minor hit in 1983 with ""My Town,"" from the You Can't Fight Fashion LP."
3,Voc fala o Portugus?,"This is a Brazilian DVD. (My title means ""Do you speak Portuguese?"") The case notes and text in the ""Extras"" are in Portuguese. Info not currently (3/18/03) in Technical Info: Recording date 1993; aspect 1.33; duration 51 minutes; audio encoding Dolby 5.1 and 2.0 surround. The studio lists, Phantom Sound and Vision, does not appear on the case or disc. Instead ""Musical Gold DVD 002"" is on the spine. Also there are some other attributions in extremely fine print on the back.It's ABBA all right. But the recording, evidently a collection of some of their music videos, is of indifferent quality. Washed-out color, soft focus, and unclear sound prevail. For me it adds immeasurably to the enjoyment and appreciation of their music to know the stories of the songs and the group itself. Those similarly interested should get the DVD ""The Winner Takes It All - The ABBA Story."""
2,Good for cardio Kickboxing,"I bought these gloves for Thai Kickboxing, that cover material is a little thin and tore open after my 4th class. So these gloves would be great for low impact boxing. Fit was great, wrist suppost is ok. Again I say, not for high impact punching, but would be suitable cardio training."
2,Good but not good enough,"I bought this gate hoping to deter my autistic daughter from going up or down the stairs. Let me just say, when that child gets an idea in her head there is no stopping her. However, it works great on my son. Sadly he is trying to follow in my daughters footsteps by hopping it but in general it is able to block his escape.Update: So dropped from 4 to 2 stars. The button has been pushed in and broken so it won't lock in place. Still opens and shuts fine but for the amount I paid, I would expect it to last a bit more. Also the pieces on the end keep coming loose, making the gate fall over. Really should have been a better product for what I paid."
4,Good for Jumpers,This gate is good for dogs with long legs that allow them to jump over. The lock is hard to open with one hand but you know it is secure. I would get this gate again for my dog in a heartbeat.
4,Solid Text-- definitly not for fun,"Having just completed a review of this book for a class that I will be teachign in the fall. I will highly reccomend it for anyone teaching a personal safety, or the first parts of drivers education. I think that this book is a great tool for the educational process. Bever, goes to great lengths to stress steps that can be taken to improve the safety of individuals not only in the home, but also in the workplace, and on the road. I highly reccomend this text for either the college or the high school levels, but this definitly isn't a recreational reading book."
2,Topsy-Turvy Soundtrack,"Ths review is from the movie, not the soundtrack, which I have not heard. But since the soundtrack is from the movie, which I have watched many times, I think reviewing the soundtrack from seeing the movie only, is valid. The movie was superb, so good that I hate to quibble. But I thought the one weakness in the movie was the performance of the musical numbers by the cast, who are, after all, actors and not musical performers. The articulation, so important in G & S, does not measure up to that of good Savoyard performers, nor do the voices, nor does the staging (not evident on the soundtrack of course). For really top notch renditions of the songs, one must go to the many CD's available of G & S operettas performed by professional Savoyards. Sorry, because the movie was so great, but there it is."
4,Better than many a G&S non-sountrack,"I was compelled to get this after seeing the overlong, flawed, but nonetheless all-around amazing 'Topsy Turvy'. (Seriously - almost every supporting actor in the film deserved an Oscar, and Jim Broadbent was robbed; his Gilbert is magnificent and real.)Inspired then to hear a true G&S performance, I bought several Carte recordings. What broke my heart is that the genuine Savoy performances are not as good as those of the 'Topsy' actors! Contrary to a review here, the articulation is just dandy. And the tenor in 'Wand'ring Minstrel' alone is far, far superior to the thin, reedy, annoying versions on the several concert cds I've heard. As is the riveting soprano on the beautiful 'The Sun Whose Rays...' of 'Topsy'; again, the actual Savoy recordings are merely shrill in comparison.I remove one star only because of the necessarily abbreviated performances here."
5,Topsy-Turvy is TOPS!!!,"This is Gilbert and Sullivan like you will never hear again! These performances are so fresh and alive with comedy flourish that my formerly ""purist"" ears reveled in delight at this magnificeant rendition of these great operettas.It is wonderful to hear excerpts from PRINCESS IDA,IOLANTHE and SORCERER (as well as THE MIKADO) when so many recordings already exist of the other G&S; chestnuts,PINAFORE and PIRATES OF PENZANCE.The actual cd itself fills the speakers and is a true listener's dream.A great soundtrack of a great film.Wonderfully recorded by SONY."
5,Here's a How-De-Do!,"It's brilliant, really! I am a self-confessed Gilbert and Sullivan fanatic, and so the release of this soundtrack to accompany a truly delightful movie provided me with an ""Oh, joy! Oh, rapture!"" moment ... many of them, actually! To hear some of my favorite tunes from some of my favorite G & S operetti performed so well makes my heart ""sing-o"" - and me, too!"
2,Not quite what I expected,"Saw people using these kayaks on the lake, thought it looked like good fun and easier to transport than a regular kayak (it's inflatable!!). Bought my boyfriend and I one, and wasn't quite as impressed. Good item to take camping for some water fun but expect to get an arm workout!"
4,A lot of fun for the money,"This has proved to be a nice item for family recreation. I have several of these for group outings. The kids just love them. The kayaks are quite stable, easy to manuever, and a novice can easily handle them.Compared with canoes and hardshell kayaks they are more forgiving, much easier to transport, but quite slow. You can plan on traveling about 1 mile per hour without current. You will not be able to make much progress up stream or into a stiff wind.They have done well on afternoon outings on tame rivers and lakes, but definately not built for big water or whitewater. The kayaks have proved reasonably durable, but I have had to patch several pinholes."
3,Fun and easy,"We have both the Coleman 1-person and 2-person inflatables, and I would recommend the 2-person any day, even for someone who intended to go solo. It just handles much better because it has bigger skegs on the bottom, which keep it tracking straighter. Other than that drawback, we've enjoyed the single one, too, but it's much slower, even if you're floating with the current."
5,awesome,we love this kayak! and we received it really fast. this coleman product is a really good one.
4,RiverRobb,"This is a nice kayak. It is easy to inflate and nice to ride. I am kind of a big guy and it is easy to get on and off. Smooth ride; nice for a beginner.Developed a hole in the seam on the right side of the seating area. After the cost of shipping it back (part of the warranty) and the return postage (also part of the warranty) and insuring the kayak during the shipping process (also part of the warranty) it was easier and cheaper to just buy a new kayak. That was disappointing to say the least. Coleman should really pay for all of the warranty issues with shipping etc. Unless of course you live near a Coleman center, then it's a piece of cake."
2,Small,"These earrings are much smaller than they look in the picture. Also, the shipping was expensive, so you didn't get much of a deal."
1,A Real Disappointment,"Lefcourt has such talent. His previous work has been witty, intelligent, and hysterically funny.Unfortunately, Eleven Karens reads as nothing more than Lefcourt's personal ... fantasies, with each Karen possessing a perfect and willing body. Lefcourt's fantasized boundless appeal to any woman he desires had me shaking my head in disbelief. This ... drivel reaches a new low by tossing in [physical] scene featuring not one, but two Karens at a time. If an explicitly described threesome is not what you had in mind, skip this book. Softcore porn is not what I was expecting from Lefcourt."
4,Samsung A900,"As you can see, i rated this phone four stars. It earns every 1 of them, the big problem with the phone is the battery life. My advise is that if you are going to buy this phone, immediately buy an extended battery for it. Other than that except for it not having an external memory card slot, the phone is great. The camera works good, the MP3 capabilities is really nice except for the limited space."
2,"OK, but can't add words to the T9 dictionary","Overall, this phone is nicely designed and packed with features, but I just cannot believe it won't allow me to add words to the T9 dictionary. I use text messaging ALL of the time, and this is a major annoyance. If I had known about this, I would not have purchased this phone. I also think the user interface is overly cutesy and not all that intuitive. I miss my plain-jane but highly functional old Nokia."
5,Best Phone I ever had!!!!!,"I had this phone for two weeks now, and I got to tell you that this is the best phone I've ever used. No problems with this unit and the calls are crystal clear. The bluetooth works great and the phone display is brillant. It is a little more difficult to used than my old samsung phone, but after a day I got used to it. Now it is pretty easy to used. The only drawback is the battery life. I used to charge my old samsung every two to three days, but this phone I have to charge every night. Other than that it is a great phone. It also takes great pictures and videos."
1,Worst phone,"It's trash. Battery dies extremely fast, its all bubbly like windowXP and runs slow. I went back to my free phone in 1 day after using this trash."
4,Solid Phone. No problems here.,"Bottom line - this phone is simple and solid. I've been in remote parts of the country with full reception, even in The Baja of Cali, Mexico - made calls to Pennsylvania flawlessly. Very durable also, dropped it many times on construction sites. Pending you dont use this phone to listen to music and watch tv on it I think you'll find this one of the best phones that Sprint/Samsung partnered on. Buy an ipod to do that. I do agree that the battery life is nothing to brag about - so what, plug it in every night or buy a car charger, big deal. Dealing with short battery life is a far cry from getting your razr replaced every 3 months. This phone was designed to talk on and not to email or text. That's what a Blackberry is for. So if you want something simple, small and solid, this phone is perfect for both the business and leisure traveler. Stop complaining all of you and stop playing with your phones so much."
2,Unhappy with this Phone,"I bought this phone as soon as it came out in December. I was dying to get my hands on it! I have been disappointed since pretty much day one and 6 months later I am sorry I wasted so much money on the latest and greatest (which will be obsolete soon anyway).My biggest complaint is the battery life. I have to charge the battery as much on this phone as I did on a 3 year old phone! Even in stand-by mode it's often out of juice when I go to use it.The speakerphone function is completely useless. Instead of a button on the phone, you must find it on a menu during a call. Not much help when you're in the car.Lastly, I have found the bluetooth technology to be unreliable, though that may be the fault of my headset.On the positive side, I will say that it takes great pictures, and the moveable lens is pretty cool."
5,Design of Art : Black Razor,"This is most beautifull looking,Thin touching and feels like nothing else in your hands and in your mind.Hi tech,endless offerings comes with joy and pleasure.News,Sports,Movies,Music,Cartoons,video,pictures,spy camera,portable satellite TV all comes with it.Best gadget you can have it.I feel like my name is James Bond with it...Best reception,comunucation,sound proclamation and information brings to your ears but,not like other phone's fears...I recommend strongly anyone to immedietly get it.Do not take seriously false and mindless negative reviews about Black Razor.Buy one You Won't regret.Black Razor is Art Design.(in and out)"
1,Battery Life Kills the Phone!!,"everything in this phone is on an average level, but the only thing is below average is the battery life, it lasts only 100 minutes maximum on bluetooth mode since I use always bluetooth. That means you need a portable outlet in your pocket to constantly charge it!!The other bad thing is the bluetooth doesn't work beyound 10 feet maximum & if you dropped it , you can't reactivate it unlike all bluetooth enabled phones I had before!!My advice, don't ever buy it."
2,over hyped,"This phone is not all that it is made out to be. The mp3 player only holds about 8 songs at the most. All the other advanced features like the satellite radio, live tv, etc, all have extra monthly service fees and on top of that because the phone has so many features, the battery life is poor."
4,Great Phone except for Bluetooth,"I have had the A900 since the first day it was available. I love it except for an issue with Bluetooth operation. I've tried at least four different Bluetooth headsets and with every one of them after making one call, a seven pulse beeping tone starts in the headset. Can't be stopped unless you turn the headset off and turn it back on.Does anyone have experience with a Bluetooth headset that works perfectly with this phone? Maybe it is my A900"
2,Sprint Costumer Service is HORRIBLE,"Had this phone for exactly four months, and has been nothing but trouble from the begining. After requesting a number transfer, Sprint managed to screw it up and had to change my phone number 3 times in one week! One time instead of correcting the problem they CANCELED MY LINE! Which i thought was resolved until 2 months later I receive a rejection for my rebate because they canceled the line on accident! I am going back to T-mobile, where i had to call customer service less times in the 3 years I was with them than the 4 months I was with Sprint."
2,"Impressive features, But its a samsung","Even though this phone has impressive features, its from samsung,which makes average phones. if your thinking about getting a phone with impressive features, get a sanyo mm-7500 or a LG fusic instead"
2,Rate yourself how??,"This book is intending to rate your performance in 100 tactical posiitons. Most of them have a trick associated with the solution. These are tricks that the worlds best tacticians overlooked, and I am supposed to know them?? Zero points are awarded for the move the GM chose. Often these are equally as good moves that go on to win the game, yet they recieve no credit. If you enjoy very tricky puzzles then grab this book. I scored 1400 yet have a USCF of 1900 so the ratings are dreadfully off."
5,The documental per excellence!,"This film through the years improves progressively and his cult status has been deserved to it all the honors and thinkable acknowledgements. Not only constitutes an admirable epic effort and artistic portrait but besides it's an artwork never equaled previous or lately. This gem of 1922 deals with the hard conditions of Eskimo life: the walrus hunt sequence or the ice bath still remain in my memory.One of the sublime milestones in the whole Cinema Story, and obviously Flaherty's glorious masterpiece!"
4,I like it - after I sharpened it!,"The knife came with a couple small dents and chips in the edge. If the subject of knives and sharpening didn't interest me, I probably wouldn't have noticed. I was able to use my DMT Aligner to fix the factory edge. Now the knife is shaving sharp. Unfortunately, deer season is over so I haven't had a chance to butcher anything. The handle is comfortable and retains decent grip when wet/soapy."
5,A desert island disk!!!,"I first bought this album back in the 70's and became an instant fan! The ""Not Shy"" album rates as my favorite album of all time! Every song is a winner, not just two or three songs. They are timeless, uplifting, bouncy and harmonic. Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks helped produce this album and while their influence shows, Walter's talents help push this album beyond just a Fleetwood Mac clone. Put this cd into your car's cd player and you will be singing along to ""Blonde in the Blue T-Bird"" and ""Finally Found a Girlfriend."""
4,"EXCELLENT. Now bring on ""Hi-Fi.""","I looked forward for years to the CD release of this classic. But as great as it is, ""Hi-Fi"" (his follow-up release) was always my favorite. Hopefully this better-than-the-original ""sequel"" is forthcoming!! Thanks."
5,The perfect pop song,"Nothing comes near the melody of ""Magnet & Steel."" It combines the music of 1970's Fleetwood Mac with the lyrical genius of Walter Egan.Great guitar solo in the middle."
4,Mutoh Keiji's movie! :),"Dare we say that the only real reason to purchase this film in the US is it has Mutoh Keiji (the Great Muta) as the lead? Otherwise, it's pretty standard fare (although not a bad story by any means). It's quite fun for what it is, although a bit strange.Worth the purchase for Mutoh Keiji fans!"
2,Great Actor - Terrible Singer,"I've got to admit, I was very sad to hear that ""Andy"" had passed away, and I'm sure that is what prompted my impulse buying of two of his DVD / albums. I wish that I had taken the time to hear a couple of selections before buying them --- 'cuz if I had, I'd NEVER have purchased them. Don't get me wrong, he was a wonderful actor, and probably a very nice person, but I did not enjoy his singing."
4,Kerstin Thorborg,"Preiser historical transfers are amongst the best available. For thisCD Preiser have assembled almost all the commercially availablerecordings made by the Swedish contralto Kerstin Thorborg (1896-1970),including also the Elsa-Ortrud duet from Act II of""Lohengrin"" taken from a 1940 broadcast performance from theMet, where the Elsa was Elisabeth Rethberg. One can hear the healthyyoung voice best in the four arias recorded in Berlin in the early1930s. Its power and nobility are best conveyed in the series ofWagner recordings made in New York in the 1940s, items rarely heard asindividual excerpts. Some German lieder are included. As plenty of""live"" recordings prove, both Toscanini and Bruno Waltermade extensive use of this fine Swedish singer, who surely had one ofthe most beautiful contralto voices of the century. Biographical andrecording details are included."
5,no guessing,"This takes all the guess work out of making the curb properly,the dam is pre sloped. works great.I had no problem with installing the tile after it was completed."
5,Quick and easy,The nice thing about the curb form is that it makes it more of a mechanical operation to pour a curb with the correct slope and dimensions rather than an artistic exercise. The system is easy to install and the directions are clear.
5,Mental Health Through Will Training,"I was familiar with this book before purchasing. Although it was written a while back there are some very good lessons you can use for you mental health . I attended some Recovery Inc. group meetings and as they always say when the group ""spots"", you can choose to accept or reject the comments made. Not a fix all but a great assest to your mental health."
4,Recovery International,"Although initially published in the 1950's, Dr. Low's system is a practical and effective method to re-train reaction to anger and anxiety-producing situations. Attending a Rocovery International meeting and using this book has helped me understand how to de-fuse such situations."
2,"Fluff, no substance","Spend an extra 5 bucks and get Maui Revealed or one of the thicker guides. This one is a lot of pictures, little real travel advice."
3,Maui Guide,"Having used these guides before and loving their convenience we bought this one before going to Maui. It is good and works pretty well. However, my parents later on (before the trip) bought us the Maui Revealed guide and it was used far more often and we liked it a whole bunch more."
4,Floating and Passioante,"Perahia's playing seems to leep off the keys. The sound is intimate when called for yet still retains the power when needed. The interpretation of Mendelssohn is clean and romantic and the Liszt is an added bonus.If you enjoyed this CD, check out John McArthur's HIDDEN, equally filled with surprises and treasures."
3,Good costume,"I ordered this last minute and it came in time. My son is not a big kid and it fit him perfect. He was comfortable in it.He didn't want to keep the hood on but that is just him. It is cute but it could pass for a cow. Some people were not sure that he was a dog but it was still a comfortable and easy to wear costume ( it is light weight as well, he did not sweat too much in it). We were happy with it."
1,Poor quality inks,"If you care about color reproduction and are used to the quality of Epson inks then avoid these as they are under performing. Bought a set of Black and Color but the overall color reproduction quality is terrible, nowhere near the quality of OEM ink. Sorry pantone, its pretty easy to see why they pulled the plug on these, definitely NOT worth the money, no matter how inexpensive. I pulled mine out and tossed them. Big sad waste of money."
4,Supernatural Samurai,"This movie has the great Sonny Chiba reprising his role from ""Shogun's Samurai"" but the tone of this movie is totally different. The focus is on horror and the supernatural. It takes awhile for the movie to warm up and a western viewer to figure out the plot, but after the first 30 minutes things really move. The ending in the burning building is AWESOME!Not as good as ""Shogun's Samurai"" but better than ""Legend of the Eight Saumrai"". And watch it in Japanese with subtitles, for God's sake!"
5,Subtitles,This dvd does have english subtitles throughout all the spoken language but you have to select it from the dvd setup title menu rather than change it using the dvd remote during the film
2,Bad dubbing but the movie is even worse!,"OMG this thing was horrible. If you have seen Shogun's Samurai and are expecting something on the level of that, you are in for a big surprise. Legend of the Eight Samurai is better than this and that was horible!The movie starts off like it is going to be high class with all of these weird things going on. But the movie just drags on for about an hour and a half and manages to put in a couple of fight scenes that were almost good. Even Sanada blew in this movie and that NEVER happens.But not to worry, this movie does come to an end.I got this as part of the sonny chiba 5 pack. If it was in original language and widescreened, there is still no way I would have given this a 3."
1,Not worth buying!,"I had a hard time making it through the whole movie. I actually fast forwarded lot of the scenes, because it just dragged on. This is a good film to watch if your cable goes out and it is pouring rain outside. You may want to just rent this film first before buying it."
4,Beautiful,To think that all of us can make of our own personal lives something as meaningful as Jorge Reyes did in Rediscovering Cuba. A welcome addition to our Latino literature.
4,The embattled Reyes,"Reyes is a tough cookie to break, and one of the most thought-provoking writers to read. A book like this one which is chosen every semester in some American universities as part of their courses must be good, or at least above the average.This book, published more than five years ago, still sells well and it seems to create a furor everywhere that Reyes speaks about it.I remember Reyes speaking at the 2002 or 2003 Miami Book Fair and though one of the most eloquent young writers I've ever met, he had to be escorted out of the room because some in the audience began to disagree with his political stance. Reyes, I remember, simply came back to face his accusers and in no uncertain term continued with his reading become more forceful and more cogent the madder he got.In these days of intellectual dearth, Reyes stands out."
5,Michelin Tourist Guides,"I found Michelin collection of tourist guides very helpful in general and specificly about California. The way the issues most critical for your travel are organized, the consise way of presenting information and organizing in the book is amaizing.I do travel a lot and my first choice for guide books is always Michelin. I strongly reccomend you to do the same."
5,Old Southern Apples,"A must-have book for anyone who loves apples and wonders how they evolved. The history of the early orchards is fascinating. There are around 1600 descriptions of apples that are still available. In addition there are 1300 more descriptions of extinct varieties. There are several pages of color plates of various apples along with names and addresses of nursery suppliers of trees and rootstocks. There is an excellent index.I was doubly interested in the book because my home county in VA is mentioned several times, as well as the cover photo being from the same county."
3,Go Blue!,Its a Michigan hat and thats why I love it. Shipping was almost as much as the hat. It has free shipping now though (they just doubled the price of the hat).
3,"Get it if you want it, but you dont HAVE to have it!","This is a nice dvd set, but you dont have to have it. Its got coreography which I dont really need. I wish it had more technique, and advanced bellydance moves. But there is plenty of material to have fun with. There is the move, then drill repetition, then combinations and coreography. Its not necessary to have this set, but if you can, then why not. Its similiar to Jillinas other dvd set.Instructional Bellydance With Jillina - Level 1"
1,scrambled unconnected,"i didn't like it at all, this women who is unsettled about her self and everbody, truly scatter brain or bipolar"
2,Doesn't always Work,"The controller is nice to look at, and my son was excited that it was a NY Giants item. However, this controller is very fickle. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. This can be very frustrating when you are in the middle of a game."
4,Great Cookware!,"This cooker is one of the many wonderful pieces of T-Fal stainless steel that I have. It works extremely well for cooking all kinds of things besides chicken. In fact, I used it last night for cooking Sloppy Joes and it was fast and required very little cleaning up."
3,"Lamda, Lamda, Lamda nerd....","Ok, before he went on to fame and glory in Revenge of the Nerds, Robert Carradine did this fine film for which he obviously got short-changed for not getting an Oscar. This is perhaps the greatest film ever committed to celluloid, outside of your finer late 70's and 1980's xxx pornography. This movie, with him and others cavorting about with cheerleaders is simply delightful fun for the entire family, and a great way to spend an evening. Watch it again and again."
4,Great '70s Fun!,"This disc would have been a lot better if it just contained ""The Pom Pom Girls"". The ""Beach Girls"" is a bit of a rip-off of ""Malibu Beach"" The bikini-top stealing dog scenes were pulled directly from that movie. ""The Pom Pom Girls"" has a fun plot and is totally '70s. The hair, fashions, and don't forget making out in a van! Robert Carradine did a great job in this movie. The plot consists of him and his buddy having fun for the summer, and meeting up with 2 foxy women along the way. ""The Beach Girls"" is awful by comparison. The storyline is boring, and the movie plods along. It was trying to be a '70s movie, but things had changed by the '80s. For the DVD, I am not a big fan of double-sided discs. They tend to experience DVD rot over time. This happens because the glue bonding the 2 sides breaks down. It would have been better to just offer 2 single discs. ""The Beach Girls"" disc could be used as a coaster then!"
2,the beach girls,This movie was bad on vhs and doesn't get much better with dvd. The plot is bad but the acting is worse. So if you love really bad b movies this one is for you.
4,The Beach Girls - a classic of the genre,"If you collect jiggling ... movies from the seventies and early eighties like me, The Beach Girls definitely needs to be in your collection. This movie harkens back to a more innocent time when all you needed was a rich uncle's beach house, a few college age bimbos, and eight garbage bags of weed washed up on shore to have a rockin' good time. Where this movie really delivers is in the area of jiggling naked .... I don't think the movie goes more than five minutes without delivering real, non-surgically altered mammaries. The Pom Pom girls is pretty forgettable, except for seeing Robert Carradine in an early role."
3,Only one side of the DVD is needed,"Before buying this video combo package I tried in vain just to get the Beach Girls by it'self but could not. As always, I read reviews of products when possible and found after buying this product that it is indeed true what many other reviewers have said. Pom Pom Girls is a total waste of a movie.I personally sat down to give it a chance just in case bias was involved but was quickly bored by the SLOW moving story, plot and everything else.Beach Girls on the other hand was and is still the '80 fun filled teenage romp movie that it was intended to be. Sure there's alot of stuff that would never happen in real life but who cares. It's a fun movie with a quick up beat to it.If you get this DVD, be sure to watch the Beach Girls and if you run out of coasters at a party be sure to put Pom Pom Girls side up to compensate."
4,It's got Debra Blee---and that's reason enough!!!,"I'm the first to agree The Beach Girls is far from hilarious,but considering the rotten state of the teen-sex genre ever since Hollywood stole it away from the little guys {like the whole !!#%!@#!&!! American Pie series!},this 1982 film,hearkening back to the '70's drive-in,is like a breath of fresh air!AND---it's got Debra Blee,whose topless scene is far more than she did in the few other low-budget films she did!{Including her ridiculously miscast as an ""rich b*tch"" in Malibu Bikini Shop}"
3,The pom pom girls vs. the beach girls.,"It is a good thing that the pom pom girls comes on the same disk. Otherwise it would barely sell at all. I got this selection for the beach girls. I remember watching it on cable in the 80's. It was a good 80's movie. Silly, funny and yes a good amount of T&A. The pom pom girls, I didn't see the last half. It was boring."
3,Too Much Football Players; Not Enough Pom-Pom Girls,"The title pretty much says it all. This movie was made to be forgotten if you bothered to watch it at all. Basically it's a forgettable Seventies high school comedy that might strike a nostalgic chord if you happened to have been there. Others be forwarned. This flick was not so much made but manufactured for the drive-in audience. It was designed to be triple-billed with other innocuous fare for a teen audience with little to do on a Saturday night. You can stop at any point and neck with your honey and you're not going to miss much. You can gauge what's going on if you really care. ""Schindler's List"" this is not. Tagged with an ""R"" rating at the time but pretty tame by today's standards. Can't recall any female nudity but there is a shower scene in the boy's locker room that's pretty discrete."
4,The summer is not over without a Pom Pom Girl,"The Pom Pom Girls (1976). Running Time: 89 mins.Another low-budget movie assured to give you T & A. Directed by Joseph Ruben.Rosedale High School football player, Jessie (Michael Mullins) and Johnnie (Robert Carradine) are teenagers in heat for the Pom Pom Girls, Laurie (Jennifer Ashley) and Sally (Lisa Reeves). They would do anything for a kiss and a make-out session.Their jealousy is towards the class stud, Duane (Bill Adler) who always gets the girls, including Sue Anne (Susan Player).With the first week of school, no discipline, what do you expect.Contains male and female nudity.Also in the cast: James Gammon, Lou Fant, Cheryl Smith, Diane Lee Hart, Sondra Lowell.Filmed at Chaminade High school, West Hills, Los Angeles, California.Nice songs by Michael Lloyd, ""Baby Love"", You're Gonna Find Love"""
5,Awesome,"Awesome coffee mug. The only downside is everyone thinks I've put rum in my coffee, when I would never dare to ruin rum by getting coffee in it."
2,Terrible Pump,"It does the job, but it is very loud and it takes forever just to fill a one man kayak. I am appalled at the other reviews that were pleased with this product. It is nice that it is rechargeable, but just needs more power to be effective. I would look elsewhere, which is what I am doing, but who knows when this piece of junk gets good reviews!"
1,Useless and unreturnable,"This piece of junk never worked. It's completely useless. Doesn't charge, completely non-functional. And to return it, you have to get to a Coleman Repair/Distribution center. If there's not one you can get to (and there probably isn't), you have to ship it to them and you pay the shipping. So it costs almost as much as the pump just to get your money back.Absolute Garbage."
4,solid but battery is weird,"does exactly what it says it will do and the deflater is great! the weird part is it says the battery should always be charged to the max--suggesting that even after using it for a few minutes, you should recharge it. this seems kinda weird and pretty tedious."
4,Short subjects as timeless as their medium...,"This is another fine package in the series, two classics that have obvious but effective stories to tell. ""Walking Distance"" is about Martin Sloan, successful in business but not successful in that walk of life that all men try sooner or later: trying to go home again. ""Kick the Can"" is an enormously moving and engrossing piece with Charles Witley dilivering the goods as an old man who refuses to die in Sunnydale Rest. He is a man who knows that he will die in this world if he does not escape...into the Twilight Zone. This is one you should see."
4,Finally,"My mom gave an aunt a bunch of my ""children's albums"" when I grew out of them. Luckily my Jackson Five and Donny Osmond albums weren't in the stack but the PF was. Album and Sound Magazine were lost forever when this aunt (still much loved) threw them out. Her kids were too young to know the PF. So when I entered my 30's and felt nostalgic for them I was dejected. But finally they are reissued on CD. While I don't think I'll be putting them on constently I'm pleased that the familiarity rushes back (watching reruns I still hadn't heard Only a Moment Ago) I can't get tired of hearing I think i love you or the previoulsy mentioned only a moment ago."
3,We're not ten years old anymore.....,"Some memories are better left as just that.I wore out a few copies of this L.P.way back when.Although a few tracks still hold up as classic commercial pop,and it's nice to finally hear them minus scratches,overall this is an artifact of the way it was.The ""groups"" second and third album hold up better than this one."
2,"...Well, to be honest...","To be honest, I only listen to ""I Think I Love You"". Maybe it's cause I'm truely a Beatle fan, or maybe cause the album is bad, or maybe beacuse the cosmic beings don't want me to like it, or maybe cause I'm psychoanalyzing myself right here and now. To put it plainly, there's only one good song. However if you would kill over if it weren't for the existance for these guys maybe you should buy it. In other words, extreme fans only, otherwise I suggest you don't."
2,Hard as rocks,I did not like this pillow because it was as hard as rocks. Very uncomfortable my cat won't even sleep on it.
2,My Least Favorite NIN CD,"This CD (Halo 15) is only for the most dyed-in-the-wool NIN fan. It includes three selections: a track from THE FRAGILE, a remix of another track from THE FRAGILE, and a third track unfamilliar to me. Although each of the tracks is at least worth a listen, Halo 15 is quite expensive for what it is. I doubt that this CD will encourage would-be NIN fans to explore the other halos, but if NIN is high on your list, you may want to check it out."
5,Love this stuff!,"I'm in my late 40's, but I've developed ""old lady nails"". They have vertical ridges, and they look slightly discolored. Not attractive! I've done the buffing routine, but that seems to thin them out too much. I've bought ridge fillers, nail whiteners. etc., etc. Nothing worked. What to do? Neutrogena Nail Enhancer is my answer. It makes my nails look smoother and cleaner. It's fast, it's easy and most impressive, my nails look normal again. I use it every day. It takes less then a minute and it makes a world of difference."
1,Can you say Motorhead?,"This DVD is a Spanish edition of Motorhead's 10th anniversary video dating back to 1985. This is fine for fans of Lemmy Kilmeister and Filthy Phil, but for those of you who are looking for the group The Birthday Party, Nick Cave's band from the same era, roughly, you would be better off looking elsewhere. Ditto Harold Pinter fans."
1,Motorhead's 10 year anniversary,"You may have stumbled upon this product through improper links and catalouging. People who bought ""The Birthday Party - Pleasure Heads Must Burn"" and Wim Wenders' ""Wings of Desire"", might have been sorely disappointed when they opened this package. This is a Motorhead DVD and, speaking as a fan, not a very good one at that."
2,Replacing an old timer - same kind,"I was happy to find the same Kitchen Timer that I had (mine was dropped and stopped working). I had the thing for years!! Unfortunately, the quality of the product diminished greatly. The new timer is made of lighter plastic so right off, I did not really like it but was willing to keep it. The idea of me keeping the new timer changed immediately when I tested it and could not get it to ring. I requested an exchange. I was in contact with the merchant that supplied the timer and they had one more in their store. The merchant tested it before sending it to me and it didn't work either. I had to settle for a full refund. It's just too bad companies who have a good product don't maintain the use of quality materials. Why did they feel the need to cheapen the product?? It's annoying."
5,No slop,"The miter gauge fit tight and snug right out of the box. The only movement is back and forth, no more side to side."
4,Good but not great,"Quality product; could not adjust spacers to fully engage the ""standard miter"" slot on my router table but worked well anyway."
5,Best thing since sliced bread for an old Craftsman saw,"This Incra mitre gauge is money well spent. It is ruggedly built, heavy with no slop and it's accurate. No regrets.I have an old Craftsman 10"" $99 special with the worse than useless mitre gauge & 5/8"" slot. I couldn't afford a new saw with a 3/4"" slot so I took my Dremmel and a bastard file and converted the slots to 3/4"". Not a 100% perfect but beats the heck out of what I had."
2,one size does not fit all,"seems to be an issue with these units from reviews I've read - need to determine the shaft width - manufacturer needs to specific what brands the unit fits. Found the process confusing - returned unit at my expense, and not too happy about that. Spent extra to buy a well engineered tool - it appeared to be just that, but if it doesn't fit it doesn't matter - ended up with the 'saw brand' at a 1/4th of the price and not nearly as well made.."
1,incra miterv27,Incra MITERV27 Miter V27 Miter GaugeWas told by internet chat line that it fit. It did not!!!!!!I will not ever rely on them again!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Nice miter, recomend","I would recommend this for accurate cuts like on picture frames etc. I think it needs the fence extension to make it perfect & real nice to use, just my 2 cents worth."
1,Junk,"I just tossed it into the trash after spending an hour trying to get it to cut square. I used a 12 inch square, watched video's, tried and tried. It is not worth the pain and bad cuts. Incra usually makes great tools. This is a shame."
4,Great but...,"This is a nice miter gauge for the money. the only complaint I have is that the allen screw/plastic disc bit that's supposed to take the play out of the gauge could be better. First, the allen screws are tiny. Second, it takes quite a bit of force to get the plastic discs to expand. The right size allen wrench for the screws can barely move them enough to expand as far as needed without twisting to the point where it feels like it will break. Still a vast improvement on a stock miter gauge."
3,good enough,"I didn't have problems adjusting the miter, as others had reported: It's not the best adjustment system in the world but this is a (relatively) inexpensive tool.It does have 2 limitations, though: The push bar doesn't seem to be quite perpendicular (I noticed this when I attached an auxiliary board to the miter), and the bar that fits in the sawtable slot is a little short.So, as others reported, this isn't a tool for those who need super precision or sophistication, but for a casual woodworker on a budget it's fine."
5,accurate right out of package,"First, Amazon had the best price. I read the reviews and decided to give one a try. Glad I did. Accutate right out of package. Wish I had bought one with the fence attachment."
5,Delighted,"This miter gauge is vastly better than the next-to-useless, cheap gauge that came with my Dewalt DW745 table saw. I'd buy it again in an instant."
4,multi-pure undercounter,This is a well designed system and was relatively easy to install under the sink. The only hassle to far was that I needed to carefully use plumber's tape and tighten the fitting to the unit more than I expected to keep it from leaking slowly. The water tasted better than tap and Brita in a blind taste test and no chlorine smell anymore. The flow rate is great and the chrome faucet is decent looking and does not leak.
5,Best purchase I have ever made,"I live in San Francisco. You would think that the water here would be some of the cleanest in the US. WRONG. The municipal water here tastes like I am gulping from a chlorinated swimming pool. The municipal water supply has been tested for carrying cancer-causing contaminants called total trihalomethanes, or TTHMs, which are by-products of the heavy use of chlorine for disinfection of its tap water. San Francisco is one of the only US cities with such high TTHM's in its water supply.One of the only ways to get rid of these toxins is through a carbon filter. I bought the Cbvocsb by multipure, paid my contractor $250 to install, and voilla! Our water tastes clean and delicious.Expensive? I suppose. But not as expensive as cancer.I paid $365 from bestfilters. They have a coupon code on their web site."
3,This situation is not a comedy,"The failure of big city social services and the foster care networkis told as a tragedy here in which the life of a young girl spirals through homelessness, rape, gang membership to a final in robbery.In her degradation two undercover cops have a big role, one time in a police sweep introduces her to a lesbian gang leader and her foster mother is just not good enough to be any help."
5,WARNINGS:,"You should not listen to this CD if you are pregnant, have a preexisting heart condidtion or are too dang uptight. CAUTION: This CD can induce stomping and screaming. You should only listen to this CD if you are prepared a night of ultra cheesy, ultra gory, ultra demented fun! In case of over dose consult The Meteors ** Only The Meteors are Pure Psychobilly! **"
4,reply to val7 from Rittman Ohio,I agree with val7if you get this val7look up Amy Uhase in the Wadsworth Phone bookShe will tell you how to find me
5,Best Ever - Pagan parenting as it should be!,"I have had this book for 15 years. It has and will always remain my most favorite. I have two boys, 18 and 11 - they have both been raised on these very kid/family friendly rituals and ideas for incorporating our beliefs in our lives as well as instilling them in our children. This is truly the best book for this subject out there! Reprint!!! PLEASE!!!! I have about 5 families I would LOVE to get it for!!!"
2,Poor Construction,"I've owned this bag for 1-year now and travel about 80% of the time. This bag is very functional and the perfect size, but poorly made. The fabric on the case has started ""fuzzing"" every place there is any wear and some of the stitching has started coming loose. Last week the extension handle stopped working. One of the spring loaded buttons broke so the handle no longer stays up by itself. I will not own another Kensington product."
1,They suck!!!,They were all broken when they came.So be smart and don't be a retard go buy some from a local paintball arena or a local Sports Authority.P.S. Don't go Walmart there paintballs suck as muck as these do
5,Works Great,"We use this when we go camping to inflate a mattress, 3 kayaks, a tube to pull behind the boat and a few other things. It's fast, provides good pressure and just all round works great."
4,"Good product, but don't trust the gauge","I have had this air pump for a few years now. Overall it works great, however the air pressure gauge is a joke. I bought a separate precision gauge and use it instead of built in. The best part for me is that this pump is able to inflate things that require compressed air, like car and bike tires as well as things that require regular air inflation, like pool toys.I have had no issues other than inaccurate gauge."
5,awesome,"I love to cook and bake and this comes on real handy when adding butter to frostings and sauces. I bought one for a friend too,she also loves it."
1,not there yet,This was such a great concept for a product. We were so excited to try it out. Unfortunately a standard stick of butter doesn't fit. A lot of butter was wasted trying to shove the stick in and the mechanism got stuck when butter was inside (it worked again after we cleaned it out) we will have to return.
1,"Too hard, too soft, never just right.",Total Fail. Those are my husband's words for this product. I purchased it as a gift for him but we just can't get it to work. If we put it in the fridge the butter gets to hard and the product won't cut the butter. If we leave it in the cupboard the butter gets too soft and the product just gets butter squished all over it. Total Fail.
1,"Where is 4.75"" a standard length?!?","Who, besides Land-o-Lakes makes 1/4 lb sticks that are 4.75""?!! (and God only knows where that's shipped into the state from...) No one in California. What a waste of money and a stupid product that you have to measure your sticks of butter to figure out that the standard length of a stick of butter on the west coast is 3.25"" - I shouldn't have to know that!"
5,4 clicks = 1 Tbls,"Hello!I was looking for a review of this device because I've had it for some time 2 yrs. approx:. I didn't purchase it here but as a whim buy at a local Tuesday Morning store in Atlants on clearance priced under a Hamilton. I keep mine on the frig. door. I find it handy for making sauces and delivering butter staright to the pan and nice pats for pancakes,waffles or toast. I have given my mother one and she loves it to due to her arthritis flare ups."
2,It's a novelty that gets old after one stick of butter.,"It looked like a cool idea, but it doesn't work that well. Sometimes the butter would not fall from the blade. It's got some mechanics to it, so I'd imagine it'd be a nightmare to clean. It's a pain to reload as well, and it's BIG. I used it once and chucked it."
1,The butter wont suit the works,I dont hate it. Its a terrific idea which I loved. However the reality is that the cubes of butter from Northern California do not fit. They are too big by a smidge and a half. If you live somewhere with narrow butter this is for you. but not here. The engineer needs to go back and jimmy things some and put it out again.
2,Does not dispense cut butter,"We've only had this a couple of days, but so far each and every cut has remained in the bottom of the cutter and you need to use your fingers (or something else) to release the butter. I'll try a different brand and size and see if that makes a difference.The first stick (Pulgra...absolutely the best butter) we are using is the longer, more narrow stick. I did have to cut the block before putting it in the butter cutter but is was a precision cut and any of the longer sticks would have the same issue.I did watch the video on the butter cutter web site and it shows in the demonstration the guy was jerking the cutter down as he was slicing it. I tried that and it did not work."
4,Excellent idea!,"I bought this butter cutter on a whim. Wasn't sure it would really work, but it does! It makes perfect little pats of butter with a click. Makes it easy to dispense just the right amount of butter, easily, and without having to touch the butter! It does sometimes clog up with a piece of butter, but not often, therefore, the 4 stars."
4,Shades of Gray type but directed a decade ago,"If you have read the Shades of Grey trilogy or wonder about dominating-submissive relationship, then this movie is for you - even though you may not agree with the movie-line. Its definitely different from anything you might have seen before, but interesting nevertheless."
5,Not as Obscene as some people made it out to be!,"I first heard about this movie in my Independent Film Studies class. Everyone, my peers and my techer made it seem as if this movie was extremely risque. S&M is defiently something that you could put in that category...but it seemed interesting so I figured it would be something to just watch for the hell of it. Now in the opening credits I was really expecting a really graphic intense film about wat S&M pertains to, SEX! But I was surprised, sure it did have a wee bit of nudity and some sexual content...but nothing that made you blush horribly and have to hide your eyes (Or as my friend did, turn it off). I really thought it was a cute romantic comedy that just happend to have some serious issues involved with it. Defiently a movie I would buy! SO GO RENT IT!!"
4,Fun movie,"The characters were almost 'aloof' in this film. Though I've heard many things, you have to see the movie for your self.For the price, you're getting what you paid for.Not the best movie ever, but definitely the best genre of this type of film, I've seen in a long time.I'd suggest to check it out."
3,performance,"Maggie Gyllenhaal is the only thing that really makes this film compelling. The premise is interesting, but I lost interest before the end, and the end was highly disappointing. Given the perversions and unusual proclivities of both Gyllenhaal's ""Lee"" and her boss, played by an old hand at this sort of bizarre role, James Spader, the ending was somehow... a little too normal. There is entertainment value in this film, and the viewer can see a change in the dynamics of the relationship between Lee and boss in the film. (At least this is how I interpreted it). Lee's self-esteem was not the highest nor her mental state the best when she started working in the law office in which Spader is a lawyer. However, she appears to grow more confident and validated by Spader's control over her, while he grows more and more doubtful and begins questioning the relationship."
2,This is,one of the stupidest moves I ever wasted my money on. Althought I know there are truly some really sick people out there. I wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone...but to each his own.
3,The girl was interesting. Good spanking scenes,This is the story of a girl who enjoys pain. In fact she gives it to herself. It is her way of dealing with her dysfunctional family. He is a lawyer who seems to rarely have any business. He is a man who hates what he does to women. He is struggling with what he likes to do to women. While she is accepting of herself and him.I really was a little disappointed.
5,Freedom,"This is about the freeing power of alternative lifestyle choices and how loving they can be, although on the surface they may appear otherwise. I watched this movie 8/14/09 courtesy of Netflix and it is now my number one favorite movie. For people choosing this lifestyle, there was also a very good segment about ""aftercare."""
5,Great movie,"Definitely an interesting movie to watch, especially for someone that is considering something outside the box in their life. I've watched it several times and enjoyed every time."
4,"Good, However...","The movie itself was very good. There are some very sexy and emotive scenes. Great acting on the part of James Spader--he makes the film, in my opinion. Maggie Gyllenhall is also very well cast in this role. My only qualm is that this film associates BDSM with mental illness and emotional issues, implying that kink is the result of these problems."
2,Recommended by a friend,"This movie was recommended by a friend, and not what I thought it would be. I can see that it may have a following but not my thing."
5,Wonderful Movie,"Best movie I have seen that show the possibility of romance in BDSM instead of just the hyper sexuality normally associated with people in the community. Would recommend to anyone who is curious of BDSM and to those who are already into the culture. Love, love, love this movie!"
5,A little known love story of a different kind,"You don't have to be into alternative sexual lifestyles (was that PC enough?) to enjoy this movie but it would probablly help. As I recall there is no nudity to speak of, and very little traditional sexual interaction. A Dominant/submissive love story plays out beautifully with a few laughs along the way. I love this movie. I really should read some reviews and see what people with no exposure to the life think of it."
1,NOT FOR EVERYONE,I WATCHED A MOVIE CALLED THE PIANO TEACHER A FEW YEARS AGO AND WAS REMINDED OF IT WHILE THIS UNFOLDED IN FRONT OF ME. AWFUL; JUST AWFUL. IF YOU DONT GET THE WHOLE B/D OR S/M THING...WHATEVER IN THE *ELL WAS GOING ON IN THESE MOVIES(which i do not and never will) I CANT IMAGINE ANYONE WANTING TO SIT THROUGH AWKWARD MATERIAL LIKE THIS THAT JUST ISNT EVERYONES CUP OF TEA. I WONT SPOIL IT FOR ANYONE. LETS JUST SAY IF ANY SORT OF GETTING HIT FOR SEXUAL PLEASURE BOTHERS YOU....SKIP THIS SHOW.
1,piss poor,"This movie is a waste of time and money. I'd advise watching the antiques collector show - geriatric special before seeing this. You still want a copy... here, have mine."
1,Ho hum...,"Boy, Spader must have been at a low point in his career when he accepted this role. Pretty stupid film. Waste of time, certainly a waste of money."
1,Terrible movie,"What a waste of money I did by buying this DVD. It's a story about two sickos who deserve each other. I like movies about a story that could happen in real life, I can't imagine why they let her loose from the Institution and why he wasn't in the Nuthouse where he belonged."
2,did we all see the same movie?,I see all the great reviews for this movie and I just don't understand. I forced myself to sit through the whole thing and it never got better. What a waste of time!!
1,What is wrong with these people!,"How in the world can you give this movie more than one star. I rented this movie and the only reason I watched it is because James Spader was in it and I figured that it might be okay. Well, I was dead wrong. This movie is very ""weird"" from beginning to end and it makes no sense. The only people that gave this movie 4 or 5 stars are probably sick in the head and should seek professional help.Do yourself a favor and skip this trash!"
4,Watch this...,"If you're looking for a sweet quirky romantic comedy - this is about as quirky as it will get.Kudos to the cast and director for bringing a not so inquisitively talked about topic to the mainstream. But for those expecting explicit s&m; scenes, can't say I didn't warn ya, it ain't gonna happen. It is Hollywood after all.When all's said and done, this movie is a basic and formulaic romantic comedy. But if you're a sucker for those like I am, take a peek.And for those who don't wish to watch this movie because the idea of watching a woman in a submissive position - aka bending over a desk waiting for a spanking from a man - is unnerving, ask yourself whether you have the right to judge another's idea of happiness.At any rate, a topic for discussion after you watch the movie. Ha ha."
4,WOW,NOT what I expected. It covers a topic sensitive to many and one should be well informed about this movie before purchasing it. It was a good movie but ONLY for open minded adults who don't get offended easily.
3,"I love the movie, but the sound sucks","While watching the video, the sound from scene to scene would vary on volume, and there was a random buzzing sound from scene to scene. My TV is fine, and my DVD player works fine. tested it on my TV and laptop. sound on both were off."
2,Trying hard but failing,"This film is:1. Dragging2. Unfunny (though on extras the director says it's ""comedic"")3. Unsexy4. Very, very forced -- there's just no truth of life to it.I have to mention that Gyllenhaal does a very good acting job -- as an actress she's way above this tripe. But... the story being as factitious as it is, she can't save the film. The rest (acting-wise) are at best adequate.Bottom line: waste of time; can't recommend."
5,Maggie shines,"This is an extraordinary movie. Anybody can watch it, male or female. I enjoyed Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting more than anything. This movie caused me to have a crush on her! The genre can best be described as a Dark Romantic Comedy. James Spader is great with his fidgeting and yelling. The DVD presents the film in a widescreen format. The extras include the original theatrical trailer of the film which is cool to watch, a 7 minute behind-the-scenes featurette with interviews with the director and cast, a photo gallery, and audio commentary from Director Steven Shainberg and writer Erin Cressida Wilson. If you are a fan of Maggie like I am, see Secretary before seeing Mona Lisa Smile."
3,"Well, it's certainly different!","""Secretary"" won an award at the Sundance Film Festival for being the ""most original"" or ""most innovative"" movie of 2002. And it probably deserves that accolade. But is it good? Will you, the viewer, enjoy it? That will depend largely on your tastes and sensibilities; this is not a movie for everyone, and a lot of people will find it too sick or twisted for their tastes. But if a fair amount of s/m sex between two consenting adults won't bother you, then ""Secretary"" has a lot to recommend it. Its portrayal of the two main characters is perceptive and non-judgmental, and both Spader and Gyllenhaal do a bang-up job in difficult roles. If you're fairly open-minded, it's worth a rental."
4,Maggie Gyllenhaal shines in this story of a submissive,"This film is an offbeat but engaging story of a young woman who is a true submissive. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Lee, a young woman who survived a stint in a mental hospital and a recent secretarial school graduate. She begins looking for work, and is hired by a lawyer, Edward (the always slighty creepy James Spader) who runs his office in a strangely old-fashioned way. Edward soon finds out that Maggie has a secret: she's a cutter, who deals with her emotional pain by inflicting physical pain on herself. Edward takes control of the situation, and helps Lee replace her cutting with a full-blown S&M relationship with him. The film is funny and quirky, but also an affective portrait of a woman who can only truly find happiness through submission. Maggie Gyllenhaal manages to be funny, vulnerable, and sexy all at the same time. Overall, a very worthwhile film."
4,A movie for popular culture subversives,"If you are tired of the pastry puff pop culture movies meant for those that are not as smart as you, this may be your movie. I for one can't stand how dumbed down many movies are these days. If you enjoy dark humor and revel in awkward situations on screen you might enjoy it. Plus she is hot."
4,Entertainment With A Difference,This movie is about a woman who checks out of a mental institution and gets a job as a secretary with a boss who also has mental issues. The woman settles down in her job but starts to make typo errors which leads to her boss verbally abusing her. She compulsively cuts herself in response. The boss notices this and then continues to reprimand her errors in an unorthodoxed manner which leads to a sadomasochistic relationship between the two. This movie is not for everyone but if you have an open mind and a taste for something different you'll find it entertaining in an enexpected way. I know I did expect to.....but I did anyway.
3,A little too slow,Starts out slow then get funny then goes slow again. The acting is great by both Gylenhaal and Spader. Maggie's facial expressions are great. Would it prefered it to be more funny.
2,it was a disappointment-----,"basically i found this movie very disappointing.i watched it with great interest at the beginning and then i just wanted it to get to the end of the movie.i liked the idea that two people with all their quirks found each other.they first had to accept the differences in themselves before they could have a relationship with one another.the movie just lost my interest somewhere in the middle and that ""carnival"" atmosphere at the end in his office with her family and friends ----i was just rolling my eyes with the corniness of it all."
3,Good,"Interesting story, no enough action. Ending was predictable. I didnt particularly like the role he played. I like him but ive seen better"
4,Risque..and sexy,"This movie is a bit strange, but can get erotic. My husband and I really wwere turned on after watching this and don't even get into that type of sexual behavior."
4,So good & so unexpected.,"This film could easily have been the S/M crap feast that 9 1/2 Weeks was, but a fine sense of humor and a pleasurable tendency of the script, director and actors to play this straight makes for a fine film experience. The script walks a tightrope between humor and parody and finds the right tone throughout. The gal who plays the secretary is a revelation. The humor doesn't arrive from sniggering at the sex antics but from the interplay between characters. Very nicely done."
2,Oodles and Oodles of kinky postmodernist love,"Wow, there are things I really loved about this movie. Turning the love story into a kinky, sexy, controlling, postmodern, postcolonial version of Americana in the workplace. It makes you want to roll over and get your butt slapped. Until the end that is. Then the filmmakers tank the whole film by forcing it to fit within the boring Hollywood convention of a love story. They even use reporters in the film, not to make a statement on our over powering draw to the media (especially to see the foreign and uncomfortable), but to make the interviewee's statement grounded in normality. It's a fantastic movie if you don't watch the last half hour...."
4,DIFFERENT,"I enjoy movies that do a good job developing their characters in the movie. This is definately, one of them. Lee and Mr. Grey, have a super hot connection. Try something ""different"", watch this movie!!!"
1,I can't believe the reviews here...,"Are you guys friends of the director or something?I'm sorry but this is truly one of the most unpleasant and disturbing movies I have ever watched. I wish I could erase the memories of this movie from my mind, it was that bad. Whenever I think of bad movies, this is the first movie that comes to mind. It's sick, sadistic, about suicide, torture.. Words can't even begin to describe how disturbing and uncomfortable this film was. This is definitely not meant to be a feel good movie. One does not end up caring about any of the characters, because they're all so sick and twisted. I'm deviating from all the reviewers here, but believe me, you'll thank me later."
1,Not very good,"This film isn't very good. James Spader plays a very strange attorney who like to ""play"" with the secretaries he contracts to BDSM games. And Maggie Gyllenhaal has enough talent to be a good and not a mediocre actress, like many of the ones we have now, even seeing her naked doesn't makes you feel something. And I found some mistakes in the movie, like see mountains in Florida, when you can clearly see it's California. Bad dialogues and too slow."
1,Dumb,"I enjoy artsy films--this fell flat. Just plain dumb. Acting was bad, storyline was bad, continuity was bad---all of it."
1,confused.....,"i watch it once and didnt like it but couldnt understand why,so i watchsecond time,third time and now i see the light.there is no entertaiment value,director jumping from idea to ideanever connecting anything logically and clearly dont know men'smentality.the events are taking place in private like outsideworld dont exist whereas in real life its opposite; and on a top of itthe actors are excellent."
1,"totally insane, Amazon... offer us minus points... PLEASE",this is about two people who belong in a psychiatric ward. When insanity is mistaken for love. Far from funny. Disturbing that writers come up with such a script. Maybe it's their way to deal with their own insanity. There should be a certain truth to any story. This story is not believable and far from interesting. File under garbage bin.this was a total waste of time. It's amazing that most people here give it such a high ranking. Big bag of zero.
5,Effen sweet.,The product I ordered arrived very quickly and in great condition. I am a very satisfied customer. :)
2,"oh, please.","two stars for good acting, but this movie is pretentious beyond belief. under the guise of an s & m love story, it smugly dares you to say otherwise. if you don't like it, it's not because it's downright awful; it's because you're uptight and unable to appreciate alternative lifestyles. like many, many movies out now, this one insults the intelligence of its audience by offering up pure drivel disguised as art."
2,"A curiosity, but not a comedy","Theatrical trailers sneakily suggested this was a twisted romcom, but this is one of those times when the trailer people created a different movie than the one you end up getting. Secretary's two leads are hard to like - a woman just out of an institution who cuts herself, and a largely unexplained sadistic lawyer. The romance, such as it is, has as its highlight a lengthy bottom smacking scene that will appeal only to people who like bottom smacking. The comedy adds up to perhaps half a dozen slight smiles. So yes, an unusual, even thoughtful film, but very far from a sexy date movie for most people. One of those DVDs you only play once."
2,The posters were the best thing,"about this amazingly pretentious and just plain bad film. For starters, it follows no rhyme, reason or normal logic. Maybe that works in Fellini, but not a grade-C film being touted as sex-heavy. There is nothing sympathetic, really, about any character, and whatever happens, the viewer really remains unimpressed and uninvolved. The acting is OK. Gee! James Spader in a film where he plays someone with weird sexual tastes, or just someone weird, period. THERE'S something different. Was it a love story? Hate story? Both story? It doesn't really matter, because by then you won't care."
5,Terrific Film!,"This movie is fabulous. The cinematography is wonderful and the acting is great. I saw this with a bunch of friends and the only negative feedback from any of them was that it was ""weird"" for me that is often a good thing, but the negative undertone of this comment came not from the movie but from the persons lack of self confidence. Definately see this movie with someone who is confident enough to enjoy something that may make others uncomfortable... Great movie! If you watch it and aren't enjoying it stick it out the ending is something you don't want to miss"
2,secretary,came on time and in great condition. movie was so stupid i only got 20 minutes into it and had to turn it off. a big waste of time and money
5,Best date movie,"This is probably the best date movie ever (unless you're a prude). It's funny, a little twisted, and super sexy."
5,Entertaining,"This movie provides a voyeur's view of a dominant/submissive relationship that occurs between two very disturbed individuals. It begins simply enough and is easy to follow. Its complexity through the middle and even to the end is altogether funny and thought-provoking. The actors portrayed their respective roles with compelling emotion. I was never at any time confused and I never once viewed the main characters objectively, which speaks volumes given the nature of their secret compulsion. I rate this one 5 stars and 5 stars again--flawless."
5,"Hilarious, tender, disturbing, and hopeful.","Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader's performances are both quite funny and also quite painful to watch. That both characters are able to overcome their self-hatred and -disgust by loving one another in a way that accepts, rather than negates, their sadistic-masochistic habits is wonderfully optimistic."
5,I cant get enough!!,In a few words....This is BRILLIANT acting!!! this movie has my undivided attention every time i watch it.there are so many ways to interpret this movie - it keeps giving you more.
3,"Compelling , funny and uneasy",""" Secretary "" is actually a film about ' finding your other half ' and about how ' love overcomes every obstacle ' although it does feel a little bit weird saying that . The story of Lee who finds shelter from her self-traumatising obsessions in Edward's passion for humiliation is a rather kinky yet surely memorable movie offering . Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a brave , powerfull perfomance in her first leading role and without wanting to underrate Spader's fine work , the film basically rests on her shoulders . Although it's a little too-much to actually call this ' my favourite movie ' since it's quitte difficult to directly connect with the heroes , "" Secretary "" manages to makes us understand them and that alone is truly a triumph . Joy Division's "" Love Will Tear Us Apart "" wouldn't make it to it's soundtrack but The Divinyls "" Sex Will Keep Us Together "" would have been an option to consider ."
3,Tedious allegory,"The trailer, cover, and sleeve all hint unashamedly at an adult theme - sexually charged, and almost bordering on fetishism. What we actually have is a tardy allegory of the proclivities of two individuals who get thrown together in very unlikely fashion. The opening five minutes pulls you in and then annoyingly proceeds (like so many movies today) in retrospective fashion, outlining it's tale. A damaged, disturbed young woman finds solace in the employ of a compulsive and manipulative (if reluctant) lawyer and embarks on a series of ever more daring, and often bizarre role playing encounters. I would love to give more praise for actually outstanding performances, but the script is weak, and does not explore fully enough the story behind the story. A very good idea, handled very badly. Give it a miss."
5,this movie,I really like this movie it gives a glimpse into the mentaility of a rather large subgroup of people. Although i myself as not into this type of play i o have mant fornds that are in the sometimes seedy worldof BDSM. This is a great movie portraing it
4,Chick Flick for Open Minds,"At the root, at the heart of this film, is a chick flick. A very good chick flick. Sure like most other reviewers, I'll agree that it's not for everyone. If you have a hard time understanding a lifestyle that differs from your own, not a movie for you. Unless your lifestyle involves your average S&M activities, then definately movie for you. Or if you're just open minded. I guess this film gave me a better understanding of someone who is into S&M and I actually respect their motives. It's all about happiness. And this film really showed this and did a great job at it. James Spader acted really well in this, but was definately overshadowed by Maggie Gyllenhaal. She impressed me beyond words."
5,"Hot,Hot,Hot!","I never have considered myself to be ""into"" S&M. But I could not pry myself from this movie. It is hot,sexy,stirring and strange. James Spader is excellent in this role,it was made for him.You love and loathe him at the same time. I found this movie strangely exciting and very erotic. It's 9 1/2 Weeks with a kick,and a much happier ending.I will watch this again and again."
4,"Ah, Love....","I suberb indy feel movie about several quirky Floridians that lead's to an dominant and submissive relationship. Very tastefully shot and edited. Finding exquisite sensuality in the unlikeliest of circumstances. James Spaders best work since Sex, Lies and Videotape. If you enjoy this film, you might alos like American Psycho with Christian Bale. And vice versa."
2,I had trouble with this one,"I'm not into blood and the cutting scenes with Maggie Gyllenhaal made me look away. This also starts v e r y slowly, and you might tune out before it really gets going, as I was tempted to do. In all, you'll have to work if you want to get through this one, so it's not a good choice for a night of easy viewing pleasure."
5,Must see movie for those with an odd sense of humor,I loved this movie from the start. The way a young woman feels at that age is portrayed brilliantly by Maggie. The sexual tension that builds throughout the movie is a turn on. This movie relives my fairytales at finding true love and lust as a young woman. Absolutley my favorite movie
1,Not what I expected or worth the time to watch,Normally I have an open mind and always read reviews before buying something. After both of those I would have to say this was a complete waste of time and money. Amazon and the vendor worked well with me on the return. I just wish I could get the 2hrs of my life back that I spent watching it. The most entertainment this DVD could offer is to put it in the microwave for 10 seconds and watch the light show.
2,Disappointing,"I watched this because my nephew told me it was funny. I thought it was very sad, actually."
2,WHAT IS THAT ?,"It was one of the worst movies if not the worst,I've ever seen.Boredom and perversy at the uttermost level.It's not to say that ""Spader"" and ""Gyllenhaal"" are unimpressive.Indeed,they both perform excellent acting and they would be extolled if they've starred in somethink better.But purchasing and watching this movie is simply waste of time and money.I rue the day I bought it."
1,Dreadful,"The last time mainstream Hollywood tried to make a movie with material similar to this the results were equally ludicrous and disappointing -- and I am referring to ""Exit To Eden"", a brilliantly sexy book by Anne Rice (writing under one of her other names). I suppose Showgirls also fits the bill. They say that no one in Hollywood starts out to make a bad movie, and while I certainly believe that, The Secretary is one. While the acting is decent and the photograpy well done, the sexuality in the short story (from which this movie takes it's title) is so much better. Given the shortage, in my opinion, of mainstream movie with real sex scenes it must be difficult to do -- and this movie proves that. I can't really recommend this movie to anyone, unless you rent it with Showgirls and Exit To Eden for a night of camp laughs."
4,"entertaining, from begining to end","I found this to be one of the most interesting and unique films that i have seen in a long while. I was entertained right the way through. All of the actors play their parts brilliantly, especially Maggie Gyllenhaal, who really lets herself go as Lee, giving the audience great insight into her character. I felt slightly let down at the end however, as it did not seem to fit with the rest of the film. Still, an excellent movie, would recommend it to anyone who likes something a bit different!"
4,Who has the power?,"An office romance? Maybe, in a fun, distorted way. James Spader and especially Maggie Gyllenhaal are supurb in proving that you shouldn't assume the position that the power exists with the dom in a dom - sub relationship. It's erotic and darkly humorous - very entertaining."
3,Saddle and carrot.,"It's a shame that this movie is so good for so long. The final fifteen minutes is utterly unbelieveable. It's as if a different crew came in to fill in story for the end. The first hour and a half is really good. Both leads sizzle in great roles. The atmosphere is excellent and teeters on the edge of edgy drama and blackest black comedy. The entire package is marred, however, by a dissapointing third act. The film flows along and suddenly stops on a dime and changes direction completely. It turns the kind of bizzare that makes you scratch your head and say,""why'd they do that?"" Really worth seeing (especially for the performances) but could've been wrapped up into a tighter package."
3,Worth watching,"I was actually surprised by this film. It has a number of fine moments, and the underlying messages throughout are good. It's longer than two hours and, due to the nature of the story, it is rather slow moving. Yet I never lost interest. I wanted to see Becca overcome the damage breast cancer caused in her life, damage that was much more than physical and some of her own doing. The acting throughout the film is solid, although some dialogue seemed a bit forced. I'm always very aware of the music in film, and this was well done in 1 Message. It moved the story along, as the music should, never feeling cheesy or overdone or out of place. (All of those things can spoil a movie for me.)Go ahead and put this one in your DVD queue. Unless you need car chases and gunfire to make you happy, I think you'll be inspired by this story.Disclosure: I received a copy of this DVD in exchange for an honest review."
4,"An inspiring, heartfelt movie","Just about every person you know or talk to these days will have had someone they know effected by breast cancer. The films creator and star, both had family members who were effected by breast cancer, as did many among the cast and crew. I think that's why this film seemed to have such a personal touch and feel throughout the film.The movie seems to take a little while to get going at the beginning but they do a wonderful job in allowing you to see the heartbreak, depression, and loneliness that Becca feels after being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer.It's hard to say that I `enjoyed' watching this film about breast cancer, but it was very inspiring to watch.I loved how with simple words written through emails one persons life helps to change another's. With words of encouragement and God's love, Becca slowly steps out of the darkness she has allowed to fall on her and starts to find her life again."
4,1 Message...Awesome!,"I watched ""1 Message"" and all I can say is WOW! The movie is so true to life. I imagine a lot of people who experience sickness deal with depression, relationship break-ups, overbearing parents, etc., just as in the movie. What reached out to me the most was the inspiring, creative, and positive outlook that Dean had on life. I'll stop there for those who haven't seen it yet. It's an amazing movie!"
4,1 Message,"I just finished watching ""1 Message"" and all I can say is AMAZING! I had seen the movie ""I am Gabriel"" and loved it so when I saw that this movie was being offered I jumped at the chance. And then I kicked myself in the behind because I thought I had just committed to sitting through an hour and a half of girly drama 101. Boy was I wrong I started the movie and I was a little hesitant at first but about 15 minutes in I realized it was delivering a messages and an answer to many things I have been facing. If you are going to buy any movies this year I recommend ""1 Message"" as one of the top 5 on your list if not #1. It is truly a great and wonderful movie."
5,"Encouraging, Inspiring, and Thought provoking Film!","My copy of 1 Message arrived this afternoon. I sat down to watch it tonight but had no idea what I was in for. What a wonderful movie! It's very encouraging and inspiring and is a ""must see"" for just about everyone! You won't be disappointed. I really had no idea what to expect and it just about blew me away! One hint, have a box of tissues nearby and get comfy.Thank you for such a thoughtful and well done movie."
4,1 Message,"""1 Message"" is a very moving, emotional movie. It was very a refreshing take on the human's search for purpose in life."
3,Encouraging!,"I enjoyed the the movie 1 Message. It had a great overall message of overcoming, family support/reconciliation and that encouragement can go a long way!"
5,Scandinavian companionable settings,"Mary Wollstonecraft's Scandinavian journey lasted from June to October 1795. This book consists of letters to Gilbert Imlay.He was the father of her daughter.The descriptions of Sweden, Norway and Denmark she saw duringthis time are exceedingly conclusive and puts the reader there.Intrigued?A charming use of the English language {although at times genteel};nevertheless, poignantly stimulating to a fault telling what sheexperienced.Truly a classic!Dag StombergSt. Andrews, Scotland"
5,wonderful!,"I am a huge fan of Elisa Kleven's work - unique, beautiful, colorful, thought-provoking, and uplifting. Each of her books illustrate values such as acceptance, friendship, courage, compassion, confidence, perseverance, hope, love, sharing. Like her other books, this beautifully told story, offers a great message. The princess is not a plastic, skinny thing with her own convertible. She is quirky, imperfect, goes on adventures, and is made from paper, love, and the earth. She is a childhood treasure made without money. Highly, highly recommended. This one is worth buying!"
1,Read These Words Carefully.,"What do Marion Talley, Deanna Durbin, Ana Maria Alberghetti and Bejun Mehta have in common? They were all teenage sopranos who had better voices than Charlotte Church. Talley, in fact, was singing at the Met at 15. And yes, their voices had youthfulness, sweetness, and something besides - GOOD PITCH and STYLE.Give me a break."
5,If you didn't think Charlotte had a beautiful voice before..,"Listen to this! I know a lot of people said that her voice wasn't that great and she only sounded as good as a choir boy, but now that she's a year older her voice has matured and truly sounds that of a great soprano."
1,This one gets the gong.,"I bought this album because I was blown away by Charlotte's Y2K New Year rendition of Just Wave Hello. Unfortunately, the song is poorly produced on this album, with a too cutsy children's chorale in the background, and things go down from there. Granted, Charlotte has a wonderfully pure voice; however, every high note is disconcertingly fortissimo, there is little emotion in the singing, enunciation is poor, and mixing is bad. All in all, this sounds like an amateur reciting her last music lesson.Music selection is bad, too. Summertime from Porgy and Bess just does not fit.I've tried listening to the album several times, and about halfway through, the cringe factor gets too big, and all listeners present give it the gong.If you want a classical soprano, get Sarah Brightman or Renee Fleming. Or Celine Dion if you want to go a bit more popular."
2,Okay,"I bought this CD and Voice of An Angel because I had heard so much about Charlotte Church and I had heard her singing on TV, I think Charlotte is Okay but when I hear her voice I don't envision angels at all, now Sarah Brightman has a voice that makes me think of the voice of an angel. Charlotte's not a bad singer and I do think she has potential but I think she will be better in a few years when her voice is fully developed!"
