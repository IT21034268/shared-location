5,Best Strings I've Ever Used,These strings really hold their tone and last way longer than any other strings I've ever used. Definitely a good value for the money.
4,Great Quality,Great set of strings and the tone lasts for a considerable amount of time. The only drawback is the are pretty squeaky.
4,this book will help you make money,"This book explains the essential technical patterns that every trader should know. One must read this book very carefully as there are many subtle clues that can be missed.This book will help you make money. Let me say that there are a lot traders looking for an easy to make money. There is no easy way. There will be times when the patterns in this book don't work. Does that make the book/pattern invalid? No. There is no pattern that will work everytime. You are trading these patterns based on probablities. If these patterns work for you half of the time, you should be in good shape. The rest is money management. That is one area of the book where there isn't enough focus. I would also suggest reading Edwards and Magee along with Murphy."
3,Best introduction to chart patterns,"If you like to get to know more on chart patterns, this book is the ideal place to get started. Bulkowski (the expert on chart patterns) did a great job here introducing this investment method. I have red several books on chart patterns, also more advanced ones, but this is one you'll like to grab again when looking at a stock chart. Also the last chapter, with the indicators to recognize real breakouts was very helpful.If, however, you already know what chart patterns are and you don't need an introduction to them, I would advise you to take a look at the author his other books. There definitly worth their price."
1,not worth the price,The author appears to be trying to write a novel rather than an educational book. Uses past examples that may or may not be true at this time. You can get better information on chart patterns free on the internet by going to search.
5,Wonderful fragrance!,This is what my husband has worn for years and we both just love it. I am so glad you carry it!
1,Don't buy it!,"I assumed it was a spray for the price I paid for it. You know what happens when you assume, don't you?It was not a spray. It was a shake in your hand, then put it on your face. This is what I call B.S.!"
4,One of the best low end fragrances but 80 bucks?,Are the out of their minds 80 dollars? In the 90's it was 6 bucks at CVS True definition of greed
4,Santa Fe Cologne,"Good stuff. I like it a lot. My main purpose for trying Santa Fe was I was hopeful it would ""heavy"" on the patchouli. I think it fits the bill. Yup, it definitely brings you back to the 60's and 70's!!"
5,Love listening to the love songs!,"This is probably my favorite Phil Collins album. Most of the songs here are easy-going and calm to listen to. Perfect for listening to on a long trip. Listening to it on a short trip wouldn't hurt either. Or just letting the music put you to sleep at night is good to do, too."
5,More from Phil C.,"I just now got this CD today and can say, it's a great collection. I wish a few more of his were on here, like ""In too Deep"" or ""Doesn't Any one Stay together any more"" were included but its a great set none the less. I endorse this CD"
3,"GREAT ""Somewhere""","Everytime the TV commercial for TIAA CREF Financial Services (whose work serves the greater good) would come on my ears would perk up to hear a slow beautiful version of ""Somewhere"" (the old chestnut from ""West Side Story"") but to hear it sung slowly (instead of that overwrought broadway way) made it seem fresh and reflective. I searched the internet and found that the ""Somewhere"" performed in the ad was done strictly for the ad so I searched Amazon (don't you love the way you can find almost any song on Amazon) for versions of ""Somewhere."" This one by Phil Collins in fabulous. Just the style I was looking for. Check it out."
3,Fun? Let's not overstate things,"When promised ""the most fun ever- or your money back"" I was geared up for some serious grammar fun. Sadly, I was disappointed. Yes, this is more fun than reading a grammar book by yourself, but so is scrubbing the grout in your bathroom. Alas, perhaps making grammar fun is an impossible task...."
3,Ordered the wrong thing,"Seems like a good quality cable, for cheap. I give it 4 stars because I ordered this thinking it was for a droid razr and not the old school one. That's really my mistake. The return policy for open items is lame. You have to pay shipping and %25 restocking fee if you want to return it. They then get to decide upon receipt if you get a refund or not. No thank you. I'll just eat the $3.00."
5,What a deal!,Misplaced the cable for my Canon SBD800 IS. This was so cheap I figured I didn't have much to lose by giving it a try. It works great!
4,Does What It's Supposed to Do,"The grooves on the one side are great for catching run-off water or juices, though not too deep, and the dark gray grips keep the board steady. The other side has no groove but is still serviceable. This board is very large, so it's a little annoying to wash, but you get so much workspace for that minor hassle. The only thing is, I hadn't realized this board was the same price from a store as it was from Amazon - you can get it from Bed, Bath & Beyond and use the 20% coupon to save a few bucks if you're so inclined."
2,"Attractive cutting board, but warped","This red-and-white cutting board looks attractive and helps brighten up the kitchen counter. However, it arrived warped, so that I really can only use one side (the board slides around on the counter when I flip it over)."
3,"Quality is good, size runs smaller, color not correct.","Quality is very good, however the size runs smaller. I should have ordered half size bigger than my size. Plus, the color shows online is quite different than actual piece, very pink."
4,vacuum bag,The Panasonic MC-V150m 3 pack of Vacuum Bags arrived in two days and was as described. Installed in vacuum cleaner and is working.
5,Nice S&H / Packaged Well / Correct Model,"Correct model for my Panasonic vacum cleaner. OEM bags were the correct series model and all were new and sealed, happy:)"
5,Great book,I'm new to coaching PeeWee Football and have a pedestrian knowledge of the sport. This will definitely help you with drills and practice to develop fundementals that the kids will need as they progress to their next level.
5,What a refreshing debut novel,"A friend recommended this novel and once I started reading it, I could not put it down. The characters are wonderful and the story better than any I've read in a long time. Clearly this debut author is talented and I hope she continues to write more novels in the future. I'll certainly be watching for her next one!!"
1,SKIP THIS ONE,"Not only was the writing amateurish, the plot line was obvious almost from the beginning. I had read good reviews and was very disappointed in this book. Some of the dialogue was quite good, but the transitions, such as ""she bit her lip,"" ""she scratched her ear,"" etc. were awkward. I felt no real connection to the characters because of the way the book was written."
4,A hopeful story -- An author with promise,"For years after her mother dies, Kenly's dad bounces from job to job, drinking, getting fired, and dragging Kenly around with him, until he finally commits suicide. Along the way, she meets Tommy, a young man with a rare disease; Max, who could be the father she always wanted; and Lexie, a crazy girl who lives life spontaneously. After moving away for college, Kenly falls in love with Ross Loewen and gives birth to a son. Years later, they survive a horrible tragedy that would shake any marriage. Then Kenly receives an old tin box she once shared with Tommy, and inside is a secret that could unravel her world...... (Although the plot is a bit predictable, the story reveals many surprises readers won't see coming, complete with a host of well developed characters. Reminds me of Jodi Picoult in her early years. Overall, a touching, compelling story only the hard hearted wouldn't be moved by.)"
3,storyteller,"I thought the book started off slow, but as each character was developed it grew on me. The Tin Box holds memories that Kenly had put aside. A friend who was different and a family that loved him. Around a pit fire many memories are made and more surface. Mostly she learns to live and not hide. She struggles with the question of revealing a long ago secret, the paternity of her son."
3,Big Rocker,"Not one of my Favs. Noteworthy tracks: ""Satellite"", ""Self Titled Track"" & ""Invisable People"". This is the heaviest Icehouse rocker. Hit & Miss album & not a place to start for new Icehouse fans."
3,interesting,"An interesting CD. it shows the difference between musical tastes.I was curious as to the remixes and wasn't impressed. There are some songs that you shouldn't screw around with. ""American Pie"", ""If You Could Read My Mind"" and ""I Hope You Dance"" are 3 perfect examples of songs that were better left alone. While the pop radio version is fine, I could have done without the European remix versions. They are your typical trashy dance songs with one exception: they made the mistake of picking a good songs to remix. Unless you like the European dance style of music, save your money, or beter yet, buy the orignal cd if you don't have it. If you do, buy Kelly Willis, Mandy Barnett, Sara Evans..."
4,Good purchase,The book arrived in a short amount of time and was exactly as described. No disappointments whatsoever! The service was great and I would highly recommend using this seller again without any reservations. Thank you!
4,"A worthy film, but falls short of greatness.","This film is not too bad, especially considering it was made for TV. Although the English is 1980's rather than 1940's and the movie is not entirely accurate, the movie has sympathetic characters on both sides and a reasonable story line. You won't feel you wasted your time watching it. Not too many war movies have a female focus, and although the men are shown to be fairly helpless, in this situation they largely were."
4,cheaper than most,"These are good quality. Wish they weren't so expensive, but most other options were more. Easy to replace."
3,a good book....for begineers,"I am an advanced biker, I found this book to be much more for begineers, and also, it does not give you very many tips, I have tried aalmost half the rides in this book and i found that only 25% of them were actually okay. If you are advanced, like me, i don't suggest you buy this book, if you are begineer-medium biker, i suggest you can get it."
4,This actually is starting to look good,Ok I haven't really been into the Tony Hawk Pro Skaters lately and honestly they are fun but overall skateboarding wise just going down hill. Tony Hawk Underground was atually decent but as of now I still haven't bought it yet. I saw a preview during Raw for Underground 2 and I actually am thinking of purchasing this because it looks like alot of fun and is kinda back to the days when we were skating levels for fun and not hitting balls with our board or cannon balling of hills. We just might have are Tony Hawk series back. Will only have to wait and see.
3,"MURDER, EROTIC SEX AND BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.","THE BOOK SIZZLES ALONG, WITH TONS OF ACTION,MURDER, SEX AND DECEIT. THE STORY LINE WAS GOOD, BUT I FELT LACKED A LITTLE IN THE SUSPENSE DEPARTMENT. ASIDE FROM A FEW SMALL SURPRISES, THE BOOK ENDS MUCH AS I WOULD EXPECT IT TO"
4,Kate's brain matches up to any man's braun.,"When I started reading the book, I had to take it slow as to not miss anything. J.F. Freeman's writing kept me guessing and than trying to figure out where I went wrong in my thinking. While everyting was wrapped up in a neat little package at the end, I do wonder if Kate does eventually get her children and home life straightened out. that was my wish at the end of this book. Who knows does Kate come back in another mystery. I truy enjoyed it from cover to cover."
4,Emotionally damaged excop barely survives as PI,"A book wrapped up in its female characters. The males are perhaps too dull but the women make up for it in intensity of suspense, suspicion, and violence. Kate Blanchard is the good cop who washed out after an unfortunate hostage situation. A glutton for punishment, she becomes a underpaid PI ready to risk her life for little cause. When she is hired by a poor little rich girl to clear the name of her scumbag, drug smuggling, dead boyfriend, the trouble is clearly foretold. Rich girl's mother is both skilled business woman and also master manipulator. An easy read and the 490 pages pass quickly. Just the thing to entertain you on a flight, etc"
2,House of cliches...?,Well I thought so. Consequently I never really got into it. These days a thriller has to feel real to be gripping. This didn't.
3,Wrong Bucket of Beads,"I ordered the ""Sassy Baby's Bucket of Beads"" because my sister had them for her babies and they loved them. They are scented, come in a nice little plastic jar with a screw on lid. I have seen two types of beads from this manufacturer, and specifically chose this one because I'd read the other bucket of beads were hard plastic, as opposed to the softer, scented beads which come in the nice little bucket (Which for the babies is every bit as much fun as the beads themselves). After looking at the picture provided, the description and shopping around for the best price I ordered from Amazon. I got them in a timely fashion, but I was sorely disappointed to open up a cheap, flimsy, plastic container with a taped on plastic top, filled with 18 hard plastic beads. The trouble it would take to return them, wait until the problem was fixed and have the right ones redelivered just wasn't worth it. She would probably outgrow them by then! Not so thrilled."
2,Very hard to get these beads apart,"I purchased these beads when my baby was under a year thinking she would like to chew on them before she could actually play with them. She probably will be 12 before she has the strength required to pull the beads apart and push them together. I struggle with it myself. Unless your child has super strength, I would skip this product."
2,Difficult to manipulate the beads,"My child likes the bright colors, but the pieces are very difficult to connect, even for an adult. My daughter is not able to link the pieces together without any help."
3,westonjm: More like an Albert Camus than a Martin Cruz Smith,"Martin Cruz Smith's book is quite a read. The detective Arkady is an extremely convincing character. He doesn't quite fit in with the party, but he is totally dedicated to his job. The movie in part fails because William Hurt cannot carry the role. In the book it is easy for the reader to sympathize with the detective because the detective is man that has taken quite a few lumps in life, but he never gives in. Arkady is truthful to himself and even at the risk of loosing his life he is determined not to give in to the very corrupt system. He is tough and bruised. Not a hero, but also not willing to lie down. William Hurt seems lethargic in the role. He does not have any depth. He is not a man of passion. He just exists. He is not easy to identify with. The movie seems more like an Albert Camus work, rather than the thrilling ride that Martin Cruz Smith delivers."
3,scifijoe,"i found Gorky park an entertaining film. it takes place in a Russia that few of today's young people know about.it's a Russia that's portrayed as cold and unfriendly.it's a place where know one trust anyone.it's a place that know one wants to be. the story takes place in winter and begins with three murdered people found skinned in the trees of the park.who would do such a Hannis crime,and why? a murder mystery with enough twist and turns to keep your mined busy.William Hurt plays a detective who rubs the political system the wrong way.he'll stop at nothing to get the right person,know matter who it is,there going down!Lee Marvin in one of his last roles plays an American who might be at the heart of these murders .Brian Dennehy plays a American cop with his own agenda and reason for being there.crime and punishment the way it should be delivered,with a wake of innocents left in it's trail.this is a good suspenceful movie.get the popcorn and enjoy!"
5,Lee Marvin never better,"Marvin and Hurt played off of each other so well. The tension between them was subtle but powerful. Great story with even better acting. Anyone who likes suspense in their movies will enjoy this one! Anyone over ten will enjoy it. Not dated at all, even though it is over 25 years old."
4,All for Sables?,"Viewed: 1/13Rate: 71/13: People getting murdered over a handful bunch of sables? That's what confused me the most in Gorky Park. Other than that, the acting by the cast is as good as it goes. The unfolding of the layers of the mystery is well done, but it is the overall concept of the sables that hurt the film for me. All in all, Gorky Park could have been more realistic."
3,Disappointing,"Being a fan of Arkady Renko, and particularly of Gorky Park (the novel), I was very disappointed at the way the entire book was encapsulated into the video. Hunt did not make a very good Arkady."
4,T.D. is off to Catholic school,Perhaps the best of the series. This book had me laughing from age 10 to age 24. I re-read it recently and still thoroughly enjoyed it.
2,Confusing People! Just plain confusing.,"In fourth grade I read the book The Great Brain at the academy, I thought it would be a challenge because it was fifth grade level. All of my group members ( 7 people) and I read it. Majority of us said it was boring( 6 people) and one person liked it. It was confusing because at the begening Tom rides the train and controls it then in the middle he plans of making a candy store and tries to make it work and at the end he has a basket ball game which has nothing to do w/ the candy store . You would explain this book like a book that was going on the right track (like maybe a pretty dress) then after too many things get added ( like designers putting too many pathes on it) . The ending of this book should've had Tom making the candy store w/ Father Rodrigues's aprooval. But instead he was in the b-ball game."
4,Engaging and fun,"I found this book on the new books shelf at the university library. It's a cross between a media studies/cultural studies expose of the study of fan culture. The different chapters in the anthology cover different genres tv shows (Sopranos), women in violent movies (_Kill Bill_) and the aesthetics of fandom.The book was well-written, researched, and entertaining. I ate up this book and this says lots since I'm really in research and teaching mode. This book will be best served by a lay audience who is already interested in popular culture, media studies, communication, etc. A university audience will also find this book interesting in various courses in the humanities and social sciences.I can't decide which chapter was my favourite---they were all great. But, I do think the Into, Sopranos, and Kill Bill chapters were the highlights for me."
4,good,"It was lovely but a big misleading in terms of the cover being hardback, not the one from the picture. that said it was in great condition"
2,Beyond my comprehension,Chesterton was undoubtably a genius. I am certain that this book has great value and meaning but I found it beyond my ability to dig it out. The language is full of idoms and references from late nineteenth and early twentieth century England which I could not comprehend without tremendous effort. I gave up on it. I suppose this is more of a reflexion of myself than Chesterton.
5,Loved this funny book!,"I stumbled on this compact book and having just visited Amsterdam for the first time for a week, glanced at the first paragraph and was hooked. It's laugh out-loud funny, a quick read, realistic, and a great exploration about relationship--between foreigners and natives, husbands and wives, renters and landlords, and employees and employers--all in one slim volume."
2,My 'dam pathetic unemployed life,"I found this book to be a complete waste of time; the only reason I even bothered to finish it was because I had some of these (seeded?) positive reviews lingering in my mind and I kept expecting it to get better.Although the book does offer some insight into a certain sub-culture in the Netherlands (with a sprinkling of humor here and there), I should have taken the hint from some of the previous reviews before I ordered. As others have alluded, this is more of an autobiography than a book about the city or the culture. And a worthwhile autobiography it is not - I wasn't particularly impressed with the way the author chooses to live his life as a lazy unemployed slob while his wife struggles to make ends meet.I feel generous giving it two stars - the second star appearing mainly for the catchy title and the sporadic bits of humor."
2,Spoiled?,"Oh dear. I understand his other books were both readable and funny.Three wasted years in a great city, culture and country, sponging off his wife or anyone else he could find with an area of gullibility, disliking and disparaging everything from food to landscape.I dislike this kind of person, so, of course, disliked this book."
5,"Great, very funny intro to A'dam.",1st half of the book is not to be missed. It does dwindle a bit from there on.
2,Self absorbed,"Boring. Sean comes across as self absorbed, lazy and whiney. The laughs seem forced. The story meanders and doesn't seem to go anywhere or achieve anything. It's probably a personal preference, but I prefer my travel books to reveal some sort of journey - spiritual, emotional or physical, and this book is not one of them. Shallow and pointless. Try other aussie travel writers such as Sarah MacDonald's 'Holy Cow'or Sarah Turnbull's 'Almost French'instead."
5,Vacuum bags,These bags fit my Panasonic upright vacuum quite well. They arrived quickly. Good quality. Hard to find in stores. Will buy again.
3,Works OK,"I bought these because they're what my vacuum cleaner is designed for, not because they're excellent or anything. In fact, in my vacuum cleaner, carpet fibers and dust tends to collect at the top of the bag, and the bag doesn't really fill all the way up before needing to be changed. But that's probably not the bag's fault - these bags work fine."
2,Costs as much for shipping as for the bags!,"I was about to order 2 bags of these, and then saw that my total was over $12 because the shipping is >$3 for each pack of bags. You have got to be kidding me. I'll be seeking another source."
1,"Psychiatrist, Heal Thyself","The good doctor forgot that human beings do not come with a spec. With a big enough sample, people's behavior and their viewpoints follow a bell curve. ""Normal behavior"" is by definition the middle part of the curve. If those on the far left are considered as psychologically ill because they are far from the norm, then those from the far right should be equally considered. Since the good doctor has taken on the position of people on the extreme right like Ann Coulter and Michael Savage, his own psychological well being is suspect.So I think he should first cure himself before ""casting the first stone."""
1,horrible and sickening,"how someone can have so much hatred towards others is beyond me.this book is trash, don't waste your money on this quack!horribly written !"
4,A flawed view of freedom,"Aside from beginning with a flawed view of freedom (""...with no constraints on freedom, order rapidly descends into chaos...""), Rossiter makes many outstanding observations about modern liberalism's orders-of-magnitude more flawed definition of freedom. As well, he clearly (if dryly) demonstrated the irrational, even hysterical, mindset of contemporary liberals.Rossiter, like so many others, only touches on the point that the nature of problem is philosophical, and that the basis of modern liberalism is steeped in the extreme irrationality of post-modernism.A good companion read would be Goldberg's ""Liberal Fascism""."
2,Doesn't answer the question,"If you want to find out why liberals usually side with America's enemies, hate police and the military, and are in love with criminals and inadaquate people, this book won't tell you. It only focuses on why liberals are socialists.His writing style is burdensome. It seems like in each paragraph he says the same thing, but with a slightly different twist. This book could easily have been cut to one quarter of its length.Before you buy this book, you should try to sample a few pages first. If you can stomach his writing style, then go ahead and buy this book."
3,"Timely, ambitious, dry and long.","I began this book with great anticipation because I thought that within these pages would finally be the answer as to why so many leftist extremists seem so angry and unreal.Sadly, I didn't make it through the book. I quite about half way because of the dry writing style and the sheer lenghth of the book which meant I would be slogging through this for many hours to come.Dr Rossiter has some important insights to share and I respect his views. This book doesn't need a bibliography (at least not for me) because I consider him with his experience to be a primary source of information.Sadly, I put the book down thinking that he could have easily chopped 100 pages of text out and not really deprived the reader of anything.I do hope to finish it someday."
4,Intriguing Insights Into the Minds of Liberals,"Dr. Rossiter's very illuminating and insightful book answers questions that many of us have asked about the essentially childlike behavior of liberals - for instance, their temper tantrums, sense of entitlement, intolerance, and grandiosity. While listing any number of liberals' infantile expectations - from a powerful parental government to a guarantee of material security from the state to laws that punish the ""haves"" for their excesses and compensate the ""have-nots"" for their pangs of envy to an international caring agenda that understands everyone's hardships and tolerates destructive actions by others, the list goes on - Rossiter concludes that, ""these and other goals dear to the modern liberal heart are remarkable for the childhood needs they address and the adult needs they ignore."" This is an important resource for those seeking to understand what makes the liberals among us tick. Joan Swirsky, NY-based journalist and author."
1,Right-wing pop psychology.,"It is pure politics, filled with gross generalizations and empirically unsupported broad assertions. No reputable psychiatrist would consider this trash to be scientific in the least.The author should stick to courtroom ""expert"" testimony. I can't imagine him in any theraputic setting. How dare he ""diagnose"" millions of people as psychologically imbalanced. It reflects badly on his own character."
1,Reads like a boring textbook,"I was eager to read the book so I could get a deeper understanding of the reasons liberals have their world view. Unfortunately, I couldn't get past the author's ponderous writing style . I gave up after 15 pages and returned the book. I' glad that Amazon has a great return policy because I got my money back right away."
2,THE LIBERAL MIND,"THE MESSSAGE IS A CORRECT ONE, BUT THE MESSENGER IS TOO ACADEMIC. UNLESS YOUR ARE A COLLEGE PROFESSOR OR IN THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY, THIS THESIS IS UN-READABLE FOR THE COMMON LAYMAN.TOO MANY CHAPTERS; TOO TECHNICALLY MEDICAL; WRITTEN AS A UNIVERSITY THESIS FOR A PROFESSOR's TENURE."
1,Worst prose I have ever seen.,"The writing is so bad that I returned the book. I am amazed that someone agreed to publish it. If you want to read a well-written, great analysis of liberals, get Ellsworth Baker's Man in the Trap."
3,Very interesting...but be advised,"I thought this was an overblown title for what would be a fairly light treatment of liberal hysteria. Instead it is a very in-depth look at what the author firmly believes is a case of defective thinking.If you are a serious student of the human mind with a good grounding in psychology this is a fascinating read. If you are not, it may be tough going."
2,Sorry to say...,"It pains me to be be uncharitable to INFORMATION, PLEASE, as I greatly respect Mr. Grams' devotion to and services for old-time radio. The book's faults are several: its prose is not, shall we say, sterling---it bristles with solecisms and is often awkward; the proofreading is a disgrace and errors abound; surely more pictures were available?---if stills from the now-lost I,P shorts exist, why aren't they included in the book?; and [...] Grams' volume is way, way overpriced.Given these and other reasons, I can't recommend it but, paradoxically, if you're a fan of the program you'll want to own it because it's the only book dedicated to that marvelous adventure in broadcasting, INFORMATION, PLEASE. Until a comprehensive, better-written history of the show appears (an unlikely prospect, admittedly), this will have to do."
4,toby & susie history,"It's difficult to find out a lot about the traveling tent shows of mid-20th century America. Midwesterners who visited the Toby & Susie shows every summer (many even purchased season tickets) will get a shot of nostalgia from this first-person account (by Toby), the most comprehensive I've seen (but this may be largely ghost-written by V. Johnson). [Available on some sites is an issue of the Saturday Evening Post from the mid-50s that tells a larger overview.] However, I think most readers will enjoy Schaffner's wit; his writing can be a bit repetitive, but remember that he wrote a lot of the scripts for the live shows (at least those that were scripted!) so just sit back and enjoy his personal view (plus a tidbit of info that his first wife's name was Cecil!) Did you ever go and get pink popcorn thrown at you from the stage? Were you there on Sundays when they took the tents down and moved to the next little town?"
5,The Cutest,I thought this book was very cute. I like how the author wrote it. I like how he didn't make it so simple it was boring but hard enough to challenge a child. I like how it is teaching a child something about dogs and their feelings and environment but indirectly. Overall i still think it was so cute.
4,"Delta faucet, no hassle install & smooth operation","Ten minute install, no tools. Supply tubes with connectors attached were included. This model allowed mounting of a filter at the spout. The rotation of the faucet and the operation of the handle were noticeably smoother than the faucet I replaced. Some would quibble with the sprayer that has more flow at lower pressure than I was accustomed to. Lastly, shutting off the faucet requires that the handle be centered or it will trickle, annoying at first."
4,like it..,"I really like this faucet. Installation was easy...looks nice, fairly solid etc..Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that when you turn it off, the handle has to be in the middle. Some single handle faucets will turn off if the handle is off to either side or the middle.The sprayer is a bit weak...which is the other reason 4 stars but overall very nice fit and finish, smooth handle operation and easy to install. Your water lines do need to take 3/8 connections.."
4,Worthwhile Purchase,I purchased this book to use with second graders (many of whom are in the process of learning English). I have found the activities to be useful in assisting students in assembling grammatically correct extended sentences. The kids also have a great time coming up with funny sentence parts. This is a good book to purchase if you're looking for a short daily exercise to assist students with sentence construction.
4,Expanding simple sentences with ease and humor,"I am a credentialed teacher who now tutors only. I bought this book primarily for ESL students who were learning to write in English. My three ESL students this past summer had very well-developed English vocabularies, but found it hard to put their ideas into English writing. Creating ""Super Sentences"" was a major help.I also introduced the book to native English writers in grades 2-4. The book helped them see how they could easily vary their sentences by changing the position of some of the ""formula"" parts.I then took the book one step further. After each lesson was finished, we cut and saved all of the suggested phrases in a personal reference book. I highly recommend the book to parents and teachers who are helping children grow beyond simple three word sentences.Also, the book does flow well into the recommended partner, Fabulous Paragraphs.Linda in Anaheim, CA"
2,not crazy of this book,too much details.. not help the student. too much directions simple the easeir for the parents to teach the preK to kindergarten
2,just look at the sample,"This is a ""formula"" sentence book, and you can see the formula in the sample (there is only 1). At the back of the book, are center activities, which might make this the only reason you would purchase this book."
2,Get to the point,"This book was frustratingly boring and wordy. I expected this book to be thought provoking but some of the examples were simply dull and unimaginative. But my main problem with this text is the authors over engineered the sentences. They seemed to take the view: ""Why use 10 words when 30 will do?""."
3,A Fine Piece of Writing...,"...but this printing is a certifiable cluster bleep. Really unbelievable that errors such as copy-editing marks would remain in a printed text. For instance, page 18 contains a """" at the beginning of the word ""at"". There are countless other typos throughout. Surprisingly unprofessional, but for fans of the story, perhaps tolerable. Myself included."
4,Life is not always Pitch Black,"Teen suicide is one of those topics that we all want to avoid discussing, but the statistics seem to be increasing with time. Melody Carlson has written an honest portrayal of teen thoughts, feelings, and circumstances that lead teens to make this horrific and permanent decision. Though it is fiction, it also addresses the ways that families, friends and even schools can intervene. Carlson is an excellent YA author. She tackles the issues that are pertinent to teens and shows them ways that they can find God in the midst of their struggles. I highly recommend her books for the YA reader and even for parents or teachers who are wanting to see the issues from the perspective of their teens."
5,Very Informative AND Interesting,"In this book Kimm Walton gives great insights, reviews, and suggestions in an enjoyable format. Not only is this a great book to use, it's actually pleasant to read due to Walton's wit and humor."
2,Beware . . . .,"I actually worked at one of the places she suggests (a government agency), and it was the worst place I have ever worked. It had a very high turnover rate, especially for a non-firm employer. I got the impression that the recruiter was a friend of Kimm's. Employers can simply schmooze the author into putting them into her book--this how many attorneys get on those ""Best attorneys under 40"" type lists."
3,Great If Your Interested in Working at a Traditional Firm...,"I found that this book focused mainly on traditional law firms across the country rather than non-traditional aspects of the practice of law. If your willing to pick up and move across the country for a specific firm then this is the book for you. If your looking for something less traditional, keep looking..."
2,Old School,"This book does a good job of bring together a lot of information but today with the internet all of this information can be easily found. It offers such great ideas as ""Why don't you work for an NFL team? Here is the phone number to the Arizona Cardinals...."" Hey why didn't I think of that? Why don't I take my JD and become the President of the United States?"
5,Buffet tongs,Buffet tongs-Perfect size and very user friendly for buffets and easily handled by guests. Used by a professional catering company
4,salad tongs work nicely,"they were a little tight to begin with but loosened up, making it easier to open & close them. just long enough to not fall into large salad bowl."
3,Great but too rough for parrot feet,I bought this so my African Grey could have an additional outside stand option. It's great how it has an attachable food bowl but the perch is way too harsh on the feet.I understand that it is to help keep the nails trimmed but the extremely course surface can be painful to the fleshy feet. I ended up sanding the top part of the perch into a smooth surface. I left the bottom slightly course where the nails hit.
4,Classic Horror Flick,"As I am sure you already know, this is essentially the movie that started it all in terms of modern trappings in a horror film. Many of the things that are considered standard in a gothic horror film got their first appearance here. In addition, it tells a very good story, and the film quality and sound are not bad considering the film's age. I consider Black Sunday to be a must have for horror film affficianados."
3,Loved it at first - Now broken,"I've always despised wearing mascara and thought that I had the solution when I bought this 5 months ago. It was shipped in good time and made my lashes look far more feminine than cakey mascara although it did also requires more time than just putting on a few coats with a wand. However, about a month ago the plastic started cracking and I attempted to fix it with superglue to no avail. Now the plastic is so cracked that I have to use my other hand to squeeze the end of the device in order to acheive curl (immensely time consuming).A metal design would have been ideal (though more expensive) yet I suppose $15 wasn't too much to give up for 5 months of lovely lashes."
3,OK,"I have lashes that seem to stick straight out so even with mascara you just dont notice them. The usual lash curlers don't always seem to fit into my eye sockets and don't always somehow curl mine that well. I got this because of the good reviews. It is ok. It is made of plastic (which is ok), but it only curls a few lashes at a time, so you have to go along the whole lid. It also doesnt have any guide so I keep catching my eyelid skin in it (ouch). It does work well if you have the time to devote to getting the technique down of using it. I just don't have the luxury of such time."
2,WASTE,"YOU CAN BUY THIS AT ULTA, TOO. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT UNTIL RECENTLY. THIS IS ALL PLASTIC AND CHEAP. I WANTED AN ALTERNATIVE TO PLUCKING MY CORNER LASHES BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO CURL EVEN WITH THIS! OH WELL I TRIED AND DID NOT LIKE."
5,A good sampler.,"The music in this compilation is as varied and the musicians as spread out as the gypsies themselves. The four tracks from the Hungarian groups stands out the most because they have a haunting sadness to them interceded with hallow drums and passionate guitars. Track 5 from France is playful while Coco Brival's ""Le Yeux Noirs"" reminds one of the style the Gypsy Kings have made familiar throuthout the world. For me the song that stays with me the most is ""Codru."" It is full of sorrow in a romantic sort of way. It is the way I typically romanticize the lives of Gypsies,that's why it is my favorite. Over all, this is a good compilation for people trying to investigate the flavor of European gypsy music. All the songs are wonderful to listen to. Some reviewers are already recommending other compilations and musicians to try. This is the great thing about Putumayo World Music, it serves as a window into other worlds that we can visit thru beautiful music."
4,Wonderful Music- Buy it today!,"My husband and I LOVE this cd, the songs are well crafted and catchy, the artists are highly talented, and you will be tapping your foot without knowing you did it!- I dance and sing along to this cd, and you will also. Whereas it may not cover all the areas that the Rom have traveled, I highly recommend this compilation as a great starter or addition to any collection. If you are a Dancer- this CD is a must have. We love to listen to it on road trips as the miles slip by hardly noticed through the joy of the music."
5,Great Read,This book is a great read.. Its very welll written and mind opening. I hope to find more titles like this in the future...
1,Unhappy with purchase,"I am very disappointed with this hair dryer. I thought it was suppose to dry my hair in less time, it doesn't. I also purchased it because it was suppose to be light weight, it is not.If I had it to do again I would not purchase this hair dryer. I also would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Same Concert as,Don't waste your money on this one! It's the same concert as REO Speedwagon Plus minus Keep Pushin' Tough Guys That Ain't Love. Save your money. REO Speedwagon Plus is the better buy.
3,Simple to assemble but a bit weak,The product is nice enough for the price & was very simple to assemble. The problem is that the bottom drawer assembly is weak at best & a few of the predrilled holes did not align exactly right.
1,ER the pilot,I love ER but don't waste your money on this pilot issue if you've got season 1. This is just the same as the first two hours of season 1. Yes I did waste money on it because I read here that the pilot was different from the first show.
4,frustrated,I purchased this video thinking that ewan mcgregor was in it. The way it is advertised makes you think that. Also every link that leads to ewan mcgregor always end s up here to this ER series. I was very dis appointed. If any one out there has a copy I`d love to know.
4,Muy bien,Buena calidad de los materiales los colores muy acorde a lo publicado por el producto y hasta el momento la duracion del producto ha sido muy buena
5,"Same hat, lower price",I was looking around stores for this hat but did not want to purchase it due to its 34.99 price tag. I decided to look on amazon for a cheaper price which was at 28.99. I decided to order it since I already knew what size and color I wanted to purchase. I was very pleased with the condition the hat came in and the delivery time.
5,"EFFECTIVE, PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS FOR KEEPING COOL",I loved the concisely effective suggestions in this book! You can read this book and get solutions quickly in order to start making the changes that your health and relationships demand! The best book I have read or seen on anger management. Do yourself and those you love a favor and get this book! Start feeling more peace and control over your happiness today!
2,Family in Cross-Cultural Perspective,"Book is REALLY old and most copies that students have are falling apart. My book completely fell apart with every page detaching from binding. Book is influencial, but has lots of random information about other cultures which could be useful, but sometimes too much information in each chapter. Fast shipping!"
5,The Thief of Literature,"From the opening pages of this novel, the reader is swept into a world from every kids childhood fantasies. An escape from everyday life to a world that seems limitless. Clive Barker lets the reader join along in the bizarre life of Harvey Swick. Reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, Harvey is taken from his dull life and brought into a world of unique characters and strange events. The bright perfect world that Harvey is swept into comes not without its dark shadows. Soon Harvey must face his demons to try to recapture his youth in a heart pounding climax that leaves the reader in awe. This book is not without a lesson, something that few novels are able to capture in this day in age. The lesson is simple: There is no place like home. Clive Barker's imagination and stlye of writing should put this novel on everyone's list of 'books to read in my lifetime'."
1,Graphic novel?,"I was a little upset to open the box and find a graphic novel. I was soooo happy to find a copy of a book I loved as a kid, and then it was a glorified comic book!?!? Nothing was mentioned in the product description about the fact that it is a graphic novel. Returning it tomorrow. :("
5,the holiday house,"this book was the best book that i had ever read.although ive probably only read about a minimum of 10 novels in my life this book was the best. Also, the audio cassette version rocks your mom. if you ever listen to an audio book I'd recommend this one."
3,Not a 'Book',"I noticed another review complaining that their purchase wasn't clearly marked as a Graphic Novel. I must have gotten confused with the item in question because i'm the latest customer to fall 'victim' to a poorly described purchase. I wanted the 'novel' or 'book', NOT the graphic novel and to the best of my knowledge it wasn't clearly marked as such.That said, it looks compelling, and for the price i'll probably just order the 'book' and keep both."
3,"G. says ""Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm................................""","What does everybody think is so brillant about this book? Someone said it gets to the soul of Clive Barker. It's a kids book that's no where near the size of Imajica. And as for the comment that you'd have to be a metaphysicist to understand that, Imajica epitomises most of Barker's work (Everville, Weaveworld, The Great and Secret Show) whereas this does not."
1,This is NOT The Thief of Always,"This book should have on the cover that it is a comic strip version of The Thief of Always. It looks like the actual novel, but it isn't. The actual novel is a wonderful book. I did not want the comic strip version."
5,Barker's Best,"Strange how the fellow from Kirkus seemed to hate this book, and then a dozen reviews rate it a 9 or better. Kirkus made it seem that if you like Barker's horror, you wouldn't like this. I like his horror and think this is probably his best book."
5,Adults as well as children will be mesmerised,"by this ""children's book"" Although writen at a level that children can understand there are many deeper underlying concepts for the adult reader."
2,Thief of Shadowland?,"A ""Book of Milk"" rather than a Book of Blood, this one is strictly for the 13-and-under crew. Pretty uninspired and inoffensive, Barker seems to have written this on a day off. I couldn't help but think of Peter Straubs ""Shadowland"" while reading this, which, while in the same vein, is much more superior and intriguing, not to say scary than this little thing of a book."
2,Upset. Its a comic version.,"Well, I got this for myself for Christmas last year and was upset to find that it is not my beloved childhood memory... it is a comic book... graphic novel... and I decided to write this review because Christmas is here again and I still want the REAL thief of always. This one came up and it reminded me of my annoyance. My son seems to like it though, he is 8. So that is why it got 2 stars."
3,Good Story,"I enjoyed this story. I don't think it is the most spectacular thing I've ever read but it was cute and good for a young boy with a wild imagination. However, I think I'll stick to Barker's more recent novels from now on."
3,A Good Start for Young Readers,"My actual star rating is ***1/2 (since you can't put halves on this websight). Children's fantasy/fable concerning a board little boy who finds the cure for the rainy day blues in a magic house where all of your wishes are granted and each day goes through all the seasons and holidays (Christmas is every day, Halloween is every day, etc.) Offbeat for the author of such graphic works as The Helbound Heart and The Great and Secret Show and will probaly dissapoint a lot of Barker fans (I was a little). The story is a simpilistic fable whose moral is Home Is Where the Heart Is. However for young readers who aren't quite ready for Barker's more sophisticated and complexed novels this is a great read. Also inludes 42 original drawings from Clive. And don't worry there are a few flashes of the Clive Barker we've grown to love (mostly toward the end)."
4,"Definitely for the young at heart (which I, sadly, am not).","I ordered this book on the recommendation of a friend. I had heard that it was a children's book, but that many adults really loved it. I'm not into Harry Potter or anything, but I thought I might enjoy it. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't rate it as fantastic, either. It was well written and creative, but if you like a challenge, this won't do it for you."
4,Fun read for both kids and adults,"I remember reading the thief of always first when I was in middle school. It had enthralled me at the time with it's fantasy elements of a realm where kids could get whatever they wanted, at an unknown yet horrible cost.Reading it again as a young adult I must say, it still holds it's own. It might seem a bit rushed in parts but it's still excellent. The storyline is unique, the characters are interesting, quirky or creepy, and the climax is especially intriguing. It also makes one thinks: If you could have anything you wanted but at personal cost, would you take it? Or would you enjoy the new life so much you'd not care?Clive Barker is one of the masters of unique, odd, or interesting stories and novels, and the thief of always is no exception to this. I highly recommend it for people of all ages."
2,Not what I wanted,"I wish it said somewhere on the product description that this was a GRAPHIC NOVEL instead of a regular one. I remember having this read to me in elementary school, and I know it was a written one with only a couple of pages with pictures on them, like Abarat. Very annoying, since I'm not really a fan of the graphic novel."
3,The Thief of Always,"I read Abarat, and really liked it, so I was disappointed when I read this book by the same author. I might have liked it had I read it when I was younger, but such is not the case.This is about a boy, Harvey, who is very bored. On the street Harvey meets a man who tells him that he could go with him to a place where Harvey would never again be bored. Harvey follows him. Indeed, the place, Hood House, is a place where Harvey is never bored. He calls his parents, and they tell him to stay as long as he wants, saying they had arranged for it. Harvey is not suspicious, and takes the wonders of the house without question; every morning is spring, every noon is summer, every evening is fall, with Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas every day - it's all he ever could have asked for. But nothing that good lasts for long... I mean, what do you think happens when Christmas, which comes once a year, happens every night?"
1,Graphic Novel,This is a graphic novel (a.k.a. comic book). I still can't find where it says that in the item description. My kid needs the book for his English class. Now he has to wait another week until I can get the correct item for him. Waste of stinkin' money and time!!
2,A book fit for a toddler,"How can I find a word to describe this book? The wordpredictable comes to mind. Although it has elements of fantasy whichshould have made for good reading, it fails to incorperate some imagination. The only thing that stopped me from throwing it on the dung heap was that it was recommended to me by a friend....I did not see how this book can relate to anyone above a sixth grade reading level. That is not to say that books meant for children can't be enjoyed by everyone on occasion..."
5,The visuals capture the poetry of one day in Dublin,"If a movie could do justice to Molly Bloom, this is it.If a movie could skip the chapter ""Nausicaa"" and yet capture the longing inside Joyce's characters, the ruin of old Irish castles, the striving of Stephen Dedalus and the trippy wonder of the brothel where Dedalus and Mr. Bloom come together in a kind of mini-Gotterdammerung, this movie is it."
5,James Joyce's Ulysses VHS,"I first saw this movie in Manhattan in 1969. I followed it through the art theaters and saw it 4 times all together. I have long wanted to see it again and it was worth the wait having discovered it on Amazon.com. I highly recommend the movie. It is filmed in black and white which I think enhances it. It is not a substitute for reading James Joyce's 'Ulysses'. I also recommend reading the book in its entirety even if it presents a challange. Perhaps the high light of the movie is the last 20 minutes devoted to scenes and images over laid on the sound track of Molly Bloom delivering her famous soliloquy, some of the best writing in the English language."
2,"video serves a purpose, but...","AFter having read Joyce's novel, I thought that seeing a movie version of it would be interesting. In that case, I was correct. However, I believe the book was poorly represented. It is hard to capture a 66 page stream of consciosness dream sequence with film. It was an interesting idea, but..."
3,Serves its purpose,"The holes fill up pretty quick. You'll need a nail or something to clean them out. I do like how the holes put out your cigarette quickly, though, so it's worth the minor inconvenience.What would it take to give it a 5?- The holes wouldn't fill up so quickly- Made of a more durable plastic or ceramic- The top & bottom fit together better"
4,positive,"This ashtry was perfect for outside smoking. The cigaretted didn't blow out of the ashtry and the hole were very easy to extinguish the cigaretted. The only problem was that if the wind blew the ashtry off of the table, it broke easily."
3,It works now,"The holes where you are supposed to snuff out the cigarette were too small. I drilled them out and they work fine now. I also have the bigger ash tray, 8 or 9"". Buy that one instead it works great."
1,Disapointed,Really thought it was glass but just cheep plastic and kind of small the design is cool but plastic sucks for the price should have been glass or ceramic would not buy again don't use them now probably will throw them away
5,Extremely motivational!!,"This book is great for anyone thinking about starting their own business. If you have any insecurities about leaving the world of jobism, they will all disappear after reading this book."
1,I can't believe it! The book got huge mistakes in first page,"The formulas of (1.3), (1.4), (1.5),(1.6) are all wrong!Can't believe it, four formulas in first page are all have errors. Maybe the author fell so sleepy when he's writing this book!"
5,Enlightenment for the Searching One,"I was one born and raised in the church. Of a truth these things do happen and everytime it happens it is devistating. It is refreshing and encouraging to know that some people don't want to get divorced. It is even more enlightening to know that there is a choice...we can forgive. We have the power to do that. We don't have to hold things over one another's heads as collateral. Thank God for Kathy and Joel. An example of overcommers in a world where being over come with evil is rampant, they show that we can...overcome evil with good. Thank you Kathy and Joel for letting the world know that marriages can work in today's society with God's help."
3,Integrity,"Joel and Kathy,You write reviews for other books without even reading them? Does that seem reasonable at all? (It certainly is not reasonable from a biblical viewpoint)Then, you use that review to promote your own books while disparaging a book that you have not even read?"
2,THIS BOOK WAS MORE LIKE A TV INFOMERCIAL,I LIKE TO SAY THIS BOOK FELT MORE LIKE A PROMOTION FOR THE WRITTERS SERVICES THAN AN ACTUAL SELF-HELP BOOK. THERE'S GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT MARRIAGE BUT JUST NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE ME GIVE IT 4 OR EVEN 5 STARS. THE STRUGGLES THIS MARRIAGE ENCOUNTER MADE THE BOOK SOMEWHAT INTERESTING BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.
1,Don't Judge This Book by its Cover,"I was attracted to this book by the title, the reviews, and the endorsements. I read the excerpt and ordered the book. At first, the information sounded good. It gave Scriptural references to support its claims. But, the more I thought about the ideas espoused in the book and compared them with many places in Scripture, the more I realized that the concepts are not in line with the Word. Women who are looking for answers would do well to read and apply Stormie Omartian's book,The Power of a Praying Wife."
1,GROMMET?????????,"TOTALLY THE WRONG PART!!!! WE NEED A PICTURE TO COMPARE IT TO THE ONE WE NEED!!! I BOUGHT IT LOCALLY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE OLD ONE !!!! NICE!!!! FINALLY GOT THE RIGHT ONE!!! AND THE OTHER ONE, I AM GLAD IS NOT EXPENSIVE, IS IN THE TRASH NOW! WASTED LIKE $10 AND MY TIME!!!"
5,where are the tracks?,"I want to buy this soundtrack but I am waiting for the tracks to appear. So, amazon, what do you waiting for? I've heard that this release has 17 tracks. that's good news. thanks"
2,A book of lists,"There are two types of people in the world, those who are inspired by random lists of words, and those who aren't. If the tensile strength of rope inspires you to create a world, then by all means, go for it. If, however, you require more motivation, then don't buy this book. It's nice if you are stuck and using something like Tablesmith, but other than that, the book is fairly useless."
2,Selective History,"If you were from somewhere past Alpha Centaurii and read this book as your only source of information on World War II, you would conclude that the Allies (and in particular the US) lost the war. There is a very selective use of fact in a number of places in this book, leading in some cases to absurd conclusions. Like Fusell thinks the destruction of European Jewry was caused by Hitler's need for Lebensraum. Where in God's Great Left Field did that come from? His presentation and commentary on desertion, sobriety, whoring,implies that American Infantrymen in World War II were more criminal than German infantrymen in world war II.This book is an insult to millions of Americans who fought and died in Europe in WWII. Fussell should be ashamed."
1,Horrible Book,"This ""book"" is poorly researched, shows a marked prejudice on the part of the author and presents nothing new to the reader. It is a disjointed attempt to portray war as a horrible experience--no kidding. I am sorry I bought it and would hope others do not make the same mistake."
4,Excellent,Provides great detain about the effort of the allies to defeat Hitler. One of the better treatments of the war.
3,Brief glimpses,"Fussell is a master at presenting clear and accurate pictures of infantry action in World War II. In this brief presentation, however, he chooses a handful of battles and pulls out bits and pieces---mostly screwups---to make his point that our soldiers and their leaders were not always ready for what they encountered. This reader's problem is that the episodes are little more than snapshots and one suspects, or knows, that there was much more to the story."
4,"Not his best, but still worth reading","Paul Fussell is one of my favorite authors. ""The Great War and Modern Memory"" is one of my favorite books. This slim volume is not as good as his earlier ""Wartime"" (also about World War II) but it's a nice little book. The sort of book that would be nice to find in a cabin by a lake when you've somehow allowed yourself to be invited on a fishing trip and you don't fish."
5,Excellent ideas,This book gives all levels of teachers practical and ready to use ideas. Highly recommend this to all teachers involved with inclusion.
4,Love this book!,"In a very simple and interesting way,It allows to see the human body like an integral part of us.How postures, physical development, connects withour personalities, needs, strenghts and challenges.Just brilliant."
4,good reading analysis of the body and it kinesthetic functions,This book is good reading for centering the body. As a dancer i can appreciate how to center my body and understand alignment.
2,NOT what was advertised,"I ordered this item to have backup batteries for my Leica D-lux 4. The ad specified that this was a Leica brand battery. What arrived was NOT a Leica battery but seems to work. I was heading on vacation so I had to use it, but I was a bit pissed since I could have gotten a battery like this for a lower price than I paid."
2,Not Worth It,"I had high hopes for this book, but I could not even get past the first 35 or so pages. Painful to read - it is like reading a dictionary. Can't tell you if there is god info in there - because I can't bring myself to read it. It actually had phrases like, ""It is important when you have a job to give your full effort"" and ""Quitting a job means that you will no longer be employed there"". I mean come on - give me some usefull info.Try ""Days in the Lives of Social Workers"". Much better book if you are trying to decide if a career in Social Work is right for you."
1,Not current on the profession and much incorrect info,"This author is a disgrace. His writing is not from a strengths perspective and therefore not congruent with the values of the profession. He also promotes fear and stigmatizing beliefs about people with severe mental illness. I don't know if there is a way to revoke a person's PhD., but if there is, it should be done. Very,very outdated."
2,I'm a massive HALF JAPANESE fan. I gave this thing away.,"This is their latest release, 2001. There's nary a song on here that sticks to the ribs. Nothing stands out. Just meandering, wandering, not hitting the mark.These guys know how to make awesome records. I consider Music to Strip By and The Band That Would Be King and Charmed Life to be three of the finest albums ever made. Period.This stuff doesn't even come close. There's no solid song writing, nothing musically that sails, that swings, that makes ya say, ""If there was real radio in the world HALF JAPANESE would be chart toppers."" No, not on this record. One can only hope for the future.If this is the first album a person hears by HALF JAPANESE they may be struck by the complexity of their sound, of their ability to not adhere to traditional musical forms in Western (punk) pop music. Just do yerself a favor, listen to those other three albums and you'll know what's missing here. chrisbct@hotmail.com"
4,great things....a few flaws.,"the ability to sit comfortably and enjoy my video games without worry that my dogs will run through and rip the cord out is worth the trouble of having to reset the controller when it starts ""walking"" on its own. you just have to make sure the analog sticks are centered when you power it up. also it tears through triple A's. better get a big pack.i'm very happy."
5,Best Nectar Ever!,"What I love most about Best-1 hummingbird nectar is the fact that it contains nothing artificial or harmful. Who would choose to feed a bird something that could harm it? It is convenient to use and dissolves quickly. In every way, I am completely pleased with this product and intend to use nothing other than Best-1 in my hummingbird feeders."
4,Better than the saws!,"I was skeptical of this when I saw it online, but I have quite a lot of grout to remove and was not having much success with the two grout saws I had. After reading the reviews I decided it was worth a try. It works much better than the saws - it seems much sharper than the saw blades. The handle is well made to allow you to grip it easily. I also liked the fact that the blade is double sided. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that the screw holding the cutting edge kept coming loose. Even after I found an allen wrench of the correct size I still had to tighten the screw repeatedly. But, without this I'd probably be still sawing grout. One caution, if your tiles aren't lined up in straight rows you need to be careful, as you can chip the edges of the tiles."
5,High Quality Battery,"I was very impressed with the quality of the batteries I received. Clean calls, good standby time. Definitely like these better than the Chinese knock-offs."
2,works good except audio,"If this unit would have done audio well, I would have given this unit 4 stars. This unit does work well switching between 4 pc's using one keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Audio, it does horrible things to. It removes all of the lower frequencies and just leaves the upper frequencies. I can even notice this on the free speakers that came with my pc. I would not want to try this on $80 speakers. I would guess the effect would be even more pronounced. I guess I don't understand why they included audio if they didn't care if you could use it or not. So just be prepared if you buy this you will have to manually switch the audio if you want sound. I am debating returning the unit and buying something else."
1,Don't Bother with this item,Easy to hook up and that's were it ends. Will not switch computers without trying several times and several different ways. Even with IOGEAR Tech support it is useless
2,"Pricey, defective, slow technical support","Iogear tech Support delayed responding to a known defective audio chip in the unit with two weeks of emails and then insisted that I FAX my serial number to get permission to pay for returning it to them. Instead, I returned it for the $20 cheaper Cables to Go 2PT Authority2-Micro KVM with Audio that has worked flawlessly."
2,Audio quality very poor,"Buyer beware:Keyboard, Mouse and Video quality - 5 starsAudio quality - 1 starIf audio quality is important, do not buy this model. The sound level is scratchy and tin-like. I tried from 2 different computers (both Red Hat 9 and Windows XP) and the result was still the same, very *poor* audio quality.I do not know why a company which manufactures and sells computer hardware would include a feature that does not work. I have come to expect this practice from software companies where it is common practice to sell a product that is broken out of the box. For some reason this is not acceptable on hardware products.In sum, I returned my unit and bought the equivalent belkin model instead. It was worth it despite being $10 more cause the audio works great on it."
5,A little girl's dream castle,"We gave this castle to our five year old granddaughter for Christmas. It was a hit, even among her teenage, female cousins, who were a bit envious. There are so many interesting aspects to the castle. It's well made and seems to be quite durable. Large enough to accommodate a wing for Disney princesses, a wing for Barbies and a wing for animal pets. I foresee many hours of creative playtime. All we need now are a few princes and maybe a couple of horses for them to ride. (Every little girl who loves princesses needs a copy of the book ""The Paper Bag Princess"", available from Amazon. I highly recommend!)"
4,Great Castle,This is a great castle it seems to be a hit with my 3 year old. The only complaint I have is that the draw bridge doesn't easily wind up and I have to do it for her but otherwise it is a very well made toy.
5,Love it!,My 5 and 3 year old girls got this for Christmas. It has been a huge hit at our house. We got the royal family and a couple of dragons to go along with it and it has provided hours of fun for both girls. I couldn't be happier with this. Great toy for imaginative play.
5,Great Castle... and two can play at the same time!,"I got this castle for my daughters 4th birthday. She has another wooden doll house but I LOVE this castle much better. It opens very wide and her little sister (20 months) can actually play with it at the same time. Since it's long and ""open"" on both sides, there is plenty of room for more than one child to play with it. Can't do that with the tall, skinny wooden doll houses. It was a great value. For $101, we got this castle, the castle furniture and a set of the people. And it was shipped directly to our door. Melissa and Doug are great quality. We plan on the kids playing with this for many years to come. We have recommended this set for other moms of little girls. And I believe they make a boy version of it as well (called the Medieval Castle)."
2,"My kids never took to it, I don't know why","My kids love playsets and dollhouses. This looks like so much fun, and its nice and sturdy.I don't know why, but of all the many dollhouses, castles, and playsets we have in this house, this is the one they never play with. I wish I could pinpoint why, but I cannot. Maybe it's too big? Looks fun to me, but they just don't really even see it."
3,too pricey,"I thought my daughter (and son) would play with this more than they do. They still prefer to build their own castles out of building blocks. It is really beautiful, but I think if I could do it over, I'd get the regular folding castle from Melissa and Doug which costs less and isn't much different. It only lacks the turret and buttress, which is actually two-dimensional. Shipping was extremely fast. I got it the day before the earliest estimated date."
5,Beautiful toy castle,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and it is still in the plastic wrap. It's looks adorable. The colors are vibrant and I am hoping that it is as sturdy as it looks in the packaging. I purchased it based on others' reviews. I was going to purchase the Disney Castle but from the reviews on the quality decided to go with the Melissa & Doug wooden castle. I have no doubt that my granddaughter will love it. She already has many of the Disney Princesses and items that will work perfect with the castle. I would have purchased the matching furniture, but the reviews said that it was too big and bulky for the castle, so I am still looking for furniture. Some of the reviews recommended the Playmobile toys which is still an option for me. I cannot wait to see my granddaughter's face when she opens the castle."
3,Can we get a boys version?,"This is great, but can we get a little less pink and a unisex or boys version? Knights and kings and queens don't have to be just for girls."
5,Perfect castle for our princess,"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas. She LOVES it. Its perfect for Polly Pocket sized dolls. Its durable, very pretty and it folds up pefectly. My daughter can play 2 or more hours with it at a time, which is amazing!"
2,Diappointed,"We researched a number of castles for our daughter for Christmas this year - we started with the Princess Castle from Mattel but after reading the reviews took it back without even opening it, then we bought this one because the reviews were great! When we received it and took it out of the box we realized immediately that it was more for ""show"" than it was for playing. The castle itself it beautifully constructed and painted, but as other reviewers have said the openings are TINY!!! We tried it out by placing some little princesses inside, they fit but it was clear that you wouldn't be able to move them around and do any kind of immaginative play with them utilizing the roomes. We returned it and bought the teamson princess castle - more expensive but well worth it plus comes with figurines and furniture."
5,Wonderful Toy,"I purchased this castle for my daughter's 4th birthday. Today she is 5 and this is the only toy she remembers getting last year. She has played with this beautiful castle nearly every day since then and it still looks brand new. One of her favorie movies is Quest for Camelot, so I purchased Papo and Schleich figurines to resemble the characters in the story. I also purchased a dragon, a few bad guys and some lovely glittery princesses. I converted my older son's unused train table into the castle platform and she keeps her accessories in the side drawers. It is so fun to watch her play with this castle and I am very pleased with this purchase."
3,Room Size a little small!,"I agree with all the posters who say this is a sturdy, well made doll house, but I have one small complaint ....The rooms are sooo small! My 3 y/o daughter can barely get her hands inside to put mini-funiture in there, and can't play around because the openings are so tiny. I don't get it - you'd need mini-mini furniture lol!Overall, this is a great idea, but I think it fell a little short for our needs."
5,Fold Up Castle,This a wonderful gift for a little girl. It is even a little baetter than the fold up doll house I bought at Christmas!
5,Would recommend...durable and lots of fun.,"Very durable, well made product that my girls play with all the time. They mostly use play characters of miniature disney princesses and happy meal toys."
5,"WOW, that's all I can say","My girl was truly in her Princess world. This castle is absolutely amazing. Quite big. Very sturdy and made of real wood. All the details are so intricate and beautiful. I've got also furniture set for it, which turned out to be a bit on a large scale but still very pretty. I felt like a little girl myself playing with it. If you have a daughter of 2-6 years, this is the best gift you can get for her."
5,Melissa & Doug Princess Castle,"I would highly recommend this castle...very durable and the details are nice. It is solid and has held up very well during rough play with my 2 young kids and thier friends. I have purchased other Melissa & Doug toys in the past and have never been disappointed. Another quality, wooden product made for years of play."
2,Damaged before sent.,"It wasn't the product...it came damaged. The top of one ""fixed"" tower was splintered right off. It didn't happen in shipping because the shrink wrapping around the whole castle was in perfect shape. No time to send back and wait for an exchange for this is for Christmas. Did some glueing to the broken pieces and made it look o.k.,but this product was pricey. All in all, the castle is adorable and I would recommend it."
2,Splintery edges,"I just opened shrink wrap on the castle and was sad to find that all the edges were very splintery. Most edges on the castle are roughly cut with no sanding so there are jagged splinters hanging off all over. at first i considered just sanding the edges myself but realized it was a problem through the entire castle. It is unsafe for a young child to play with.It is also not put together well. Two wood panels that are glued together are cracked apart on my castle. The design is adorable but I am extremely disappointed with the quality. I expected more from this brand, and price."
5,Biggest Hit of the Year,"Update...my 3-year old slipped, fell on the corner of this castle, and needed 3 stitches to her chin. Not the product's fault, but parents of younger children should be aware.Gave this to my 3-year old for my birthday and she could barely contain herself, she was so excited. Substantial and solid. I like that it's made of wood rather than most of them that are made of plastic. I also got her the furniture and royal family set, those are nice also. Highly recommended."
1,CHEAP,"This castle is incredibly cheap. Two days after I gave this to my daughter for Christmas, it fell apart. It is poorly constructed and BARELY glued together. The castle people that you can order separately barely fit in the openings. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Very cute but not played with,"I bought this toy for my four year old daughter's birthday because the reviews were so good. Although it's cute, and there's nothing wrong with it, it's rarely ever played with. We bought the coordinating furniture set and royal family...but, they sit too. As it turns out, my daughter seems to prefer the Little People Barn we got for her two year old brother. Maybe it's just not a good fit for my daughter, but I'm pretty disappointed that we spent so much on a toy that just sits there looking pretty."
5,Beautiful princess castle!,"This castle is beautiful! My 18 month old can already play with it, using the 8 pieces mini princess collection from disney. She is discovering how the princesses fit into the different openings and especially the towers. I love it too, and can't wait for her to get old enough to decorate it with lights and furniture. I already got some 1/2 inch scale furniture which fit perfectly, but she is still too young not to brake those. Good solid construction with lovely decoration. An amazing value for the price with free shipping. The only wooden princess castle I know of, and why buying a doll house, if you can get a castle for less money?"
5,awesome deal,"got it from amazon with super saver shipping and it turned out to be a little over half the price of what i would've paid locally. i was shocked how fast it came and how well it was packed up. my daughter really likes the castle and loves to play with it in all configurations. not sure how educational it is, but at 4 years old she loves it. the only downside is you'll lose a bit of floor space."
5,My 4 yo princess loves it!,We purchased this castle for my daughters 4th birthday and she loves it. Perfect fit with the small Disney princess figures. Very high quality for a reasonable price.
5,Great Castle!,Our daughter asked for a princess doll house from Santa and this is what she got! Her little princess figurines work perfectly with it. She plays with it daily. I like that it folds up.
1,2 broken dollhouses,"We are on the second dollhouse for Christmas as the first one was broken at the hinge. The second one showed up from UPS with the same issue. Although we never even opened the second one and it was well padded in the box, the wood was broken with the hinge not even in the wood. My daughter is bummed as we have not seen another castle. Finally, as another person wrote, the openings in this doll house are very tiny! Disappointed and I love Melissa and Doug products,.."
3,"Very pretty, but not as strudy as others have said-Hinge is not strong at all.","The castle is painted very nicely painted. However, upon opening it the hinge came right out of the wood. sad;("
1,"Cheap material and quality, not sure why it had such a high rating","We bought this as a gift and found cracks all over the place. The castle was built by ""plywood"" not ""solid wooden"", and the worst part is the quality of wood glue they use. I know we can probably ask Amazon for refund or return but that's not the point, especially when you get it right before Xmas and there is no time to do anything without having to break some little one's heart.Please see my photos:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/moZGJVFRUR5YKA/B000NKH0E6/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_linkhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo2PKN7L8OYEMH9/B000NKH0E6/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_linkhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo1KG0VU7ABVZSA/B000NKH0E6/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link"
4,"Beautiful, sturdy castle... but the ""room"" are a bit small","My three year old has been very interested in doll houses lately, and my husband found this beautiful castle! It is very well put built (I'd expect no less from Melissa and Doug). The Disney ""figure set"" princesses fit perfectly so we didn't buy any dolls, though some of the dolls with the bigger skirts don't fit in some of the passages. Unfortunately the rooms are very small, almost unusable in many ways. My MIL bought her the ""castle furniture"" meant for the doll house, and you can't really put it in these rooms. Mostly she just opens the castle to play, and puts the furniture in front of it (or in what you might call the ""courtyard""). Overall we're very happy, I just wish the rooms and passages were slightly larger."
3,nice but needed touch ups,"We got this toy for my 3 year old, she loves all the moving parts and they are durable. The only problem was all the raw wood showing. We had to sand it down and even put down scrap paper on one of the floors where the wood was bubbling but altogether it is a nice castle. All her toys fit in it from My Little Pony to Disney Princess and even Polly and Little People."
2,"Beautiful, but Poorly Made","When this castle arrived it was everything the good reviews said it was; beautiful, folded up nicely, and kept my 4 year old daughter busy for a long while. However, after a week of light play, for a child who takes care of her toys, the wood started chipping and peeling off. I mean, she could have gotten a terrible splinter. So very disappointing!!! I would not recommend it now. It is too bad because it really does have nice features and it is very pretty."
2,Cute but the hinge came right out when it was opened for the first time!,Very sad that it is already broken! We just took it out of the plastic today and when we opened it up for the first time the hinges came out of the wood. Really disappointed!
3,Cute but way too big,"The idea of this castle is cute, however I was hoping to use the small polly pocket type princess dolls but they don't fit under the windows or doorways. I returned it do to its large size."
3,Cute but Tiny,All of the rooms are very small. You may be able to fit the very small dolls like La la loopsy or the small figurine princess dolls in but you cannot move them around at all and you can pretty much forget even the smallest furniture. It is well made and very cute.
5,Great Purchase,I've been looking for a doll house for a long time. My kids recently got into princesses. This is the best of both world. I love how it folds and and unfold. You can pretty much access it from all sides. It is very made. I think it will last a long time. It's beautiful. The furniture and Disney princess figures I bought does not fit quite well. I don't think the kids mind that much.
5,Beautiful,"I absolutely love this Castle. I bought the Cinderella Disney Castle for my 5 yr. old and it had missing pieces. Disney replaced it immediately, but the replacement had issues also... then when I went to order it again it was on back order. I canceled the order and went on line and found this castle. The quality is exceptional and it is beautiful. There is no comparing the Disney Castle to this Castle. The Disney castle is made of plastic. Melissa & Doug's Castle is solid wood. Plus price for this castle is half of what it is selling through Melissa & Doug's website. An excellent gift for your little girl and worth every penny. Buy some furniture. Its exceptional too. Its the perfect size for her Polly Pockets. She could not use the Cinderella castle with her Polly pockets. Its worth the money you put into it."
4,Perfect for the Princess,"Our daughter loves playing with this castle, and it has been her favorite toy for months. Mostly that's because it fits her Disney Favorite Moment princess, and several other figurine type toys, such as Breyer mini horses. I do think she likes the castle itself too, and it is fairly sturdy except for the decorative bridge between the two towers (but you don't need that piece). She loves to open the drawbridge, or slide the jail door, and move her figurines around the towers. Sometimes she plays with it closed, others open and in general, it was just a great purchase. Sometimes you spend a lot on a toy and barely see your child play with it, but in this case, she has played with the castle almost every day, plus it works as a storage box for all those tiny dolls and their (ever growing) pile of stuff."
4,My 2-year-old daughter loved this castle!,"Normally I don't write a review for products, but this is the exception to the rule. My daughter loved this castle the instant I took it out of the box. She plays with it for hours. This castle does run a little small, but I knew that from the reviews I had read. I bought the Disney mini dolls and they are almost too big for the castle. So if you are buying accessory items, i think small is better for this castle. The castle is made out of a sturdy plywood, not cheap particle board. It also has a moving drawbridge. All in all I expect this castle to last for a few years which was a good $50 well spent."
5,Christmas favorite!,"Santa brought this castle for my four year old (made by his elves), and its become a permanent fixture in the family room. She plays with it every day, and I am so happy she has this rather than the multiple plastic play sets it takes the place of. Yes the rooms are small, but it doesn't inhibit her play in any way, and it has been home to the Disney princesses, Polly pocket, Disney fairies, ponies, and the playmobil mermaid set. We did not purchase the furniture or people to go with this, instead I bought the play mobile royal bedroom which has a bed, vanity, nightstand, cradle, mom and baby. They fit perfectly! Will also be getting the royal dining room set, but honestly she is perfectly happy with the castle as is. If you already have lots of the Polly pockets sized figures, you can't go wrong with this castle."
5,Omi's Angels,"I bought this for one of my granddaughters and she absolutely loved it. She is three years old !I also bought it before for three older granddaughters, so I knew it held up well!"
3,"Kind of boring, small rooms...","I bought this for my daughter because I liked it, and thought it was durable and well made. However, my daughter has been less than enthusiastic about it the last year, bought last Christmas when she was 4. It is very heavy, so she can't move it around very well, and she would prefer something that did a little more. I think we are going to get rid of this one and get the Fisher Price one with the swan doors. She will be able to carry it from room to room and it is just a little more ""princessy"" than a plain wooden castle."
2,Openings are not small: they are tiny,"The castle is very cute and girly. I bought some play mobile furniture as suggested by another reviewer and some of the items are too big to get into the room openings. My daughter is just about three and cannot get the furniture in and out; most of the items sit out infront of the castle. I wish that I had purchased a different house with more spacious rooms (or several usable rooms). It is large, well made, and pretty; however it is not practical for the pretend play that I had in mind when I made this purchase. Most of the space available will not hold the play mobile sets (which are small) and just don't serve any purpose."
5,A Beautiful Castle,"We bought this wooden castle for our 5 year old daughter about 6 months ago and she has really enjoyed playing with it. The castle is very pretty and girly-looking which won immediate approval with our daughter. She is currently into fairies, princesses, etc so this castle is perfect. It is a well built toy and has been durable thus far and although we have only had it for 6 months, it is holding up well and I don't suspect that another 6 months (or longer) will be any different. It has many staircases, rooms and secret hiding places to stimulate her imagination. I found a really pretty king/queen medieval people set from Voila that she used in the castle; however, she recently received a set of the Barbie Kelly Kid Bunch and now the medieval people have been temporarily kicked out of the castle to make room for the little Barbies (who actually fit quite well). We are very pleased with this castle and would highly recommend it."
2,Crash Dive,"While the editorial description of this book sounded interesting, the book itself was an extremely boring disappointment. The bulk of this book deals with what the author ate and when he slept and how much he missed his wife. The actual battle descriptions are rushed through, sometimes in two or three sentences, while the author's personal daily routine goes on and on for pages. It is interesting to note that although the HMS Safari is touted as one of England's most deadly subs, the majority of it's sinkings were of small craft and schooners by gun action. Even enemy ships which ran themselves aground to escape being torpedoed are counted by the Brits as tonnage sunk! Overall, I couldn't wait for this book to end. BORING!"
2,He's My Girl,A little disappointed that it wasn't made clear that this was an edited video for language. Kind of messed it up for me but the condition was good.
1,"Twain's Adam & Eve, but not the whole story...","I recently bought this ""Literary Classics"" edition of ""The Diaries of Adam & Eve"" expecting it to be the text of the wonderful audiobook version of Twain's stories, as read by Betty Buckley and Mandy Patinkin, only to find that it is not the same at all. This version is just a replica of the original books and does not include the full text as heard on the audiobook. Then I found the version I wanted, subtitled ""Translated by Mark Twain"" and it, like the audiobook version, is really something special. To anyone interested in these wonderful ""first family"" stories, I recommend searching for the Fair Oaks Press edition."
3,rather depressing,"I'd have to agree with the previous reviewer in that while this book is a good read, it's quite depressing that Ms. Bloom managed to stay with someone like Roth for so long when all the warning signs were there from early in the relationship. I also found it disappointing that several of her films are ignored in the book, like Charly, which I thought was a teriffic film."
2,Ho hum,"Hmm. I agree with the other reviewers who say that there is no depth or reflection here. It is quite a catalogue of woes, and there is a sincerity and honesty in the telling. But.... As a piece of writing, it is not at all distinguished, and there is not much nourishment as in something left to reflect on, observations worth mulling over, whether in agreement or disagreement. It is, sadly, like some of the worst celebrity autobiogs on the shelves. Which is a pity, because I think with better editorial direction this could have been a far better book."
2,Hasn't Claire Bloom ever heard of Co-Dependency?,"This book left me with a distressingly bad taste in my heart! While the account of her early years makes for decent reading, Ms.Bloom's glaring lack of learning and GROWTH from her failed relationships with men is disturbing, even angering to read. Despite a brief sentence or two of some insight on how abandonment by her father led to her disasterous choices, a few pages later she crushes any ""hoorah-FINALLY"" the reader might feel when she again meets with the clearly disturbed misogynist Roth after their terrible divorce, and allows him to abuse her yet again. One has to wonder if Bloom even read over her own manuscript-she is either very brave, or very obtuse!"
3,Old school,"I had heard of this book for years. The book isn't as anarchist as it sounds. It has some interesting ideas and topics, but most aren't very practical for the average person."
5,Great read for the beginner,"This book is a great read for a beginner in defiance. Even if you are an expert at this subject it is still a great read. There were a couple things I learned out of this book but beings I have been at this a while most were already known, either way this book gets 5 stars from me!"
4,179 is a bit of a stretch,"I want to apologize for not giving this book five stars. I feel guilty not doing it. I'm a huge Claire Wolfe fan, and loved the heck out of this book.So why the missing star? Because 179 is a bit of a stretch. She could have called it 150, and I would have bought it, loved it, and given it five star. But 179 is disingenuous.Rather than The 5,000 Year Leap, Mr. Glen Beck should be shilling this book on his radio and television programs. Do you really distrust the system and want to derail the monolithic state? Here is a handy primer of dirty tricks to assist in monkey-wrenching the beast.I know I didn't give this book five stars (sorry, Claire!) but I can't recommend it strongly enough, and suggest you pick up a copy or three while the presses are still free."
3,Pretty good condensation,"After taking the instructor-led course for the 70-219 exam I used the Exam Cram to finish preparing for the exam. I thought it presented a lot of concepts clearly. I found a number of minor mistakes in it. I reported one and Coriolis was very responsive about passing it to the author who wrote a correction. After that I found a few more. Always go to the web site of any of these publishers and look for ""errata"". That's how they pass along corrections. I was disappointed by the Cram Sheet, one of my favorite parts of the Exam Cram series. It may just be impossible to do one well for a design exam, but I found mistakes in it and not what I would consider the best choices for distilled-down facts."
5,Adorable!,"I just recieved my copy in the mail and it's adorable, very easy for young kids to understand. I am also a horse lover and this book is a great start for a child who has questions about owning a horse."
4,Why we do stupied things...,"After reading this book I've reliezed somethings, like, how some people do some stupied things that seem so idiotic to me or some one else. It shows how we feel so safe in something that would cause so much harm or death. Ex. on a a 6 lane highway 3 and a divider which is one one foot thick seperating cars going 60 m.p.h. both ways and could be so easliy crushed. all because we see a barrier we tenden to be safe its all about how your mind makes things come to thought of wather to look over a edge and and look down with a gared rail or with out. Also explians why I enjoy playing with fire while every one around me is scared out of there mind."
3,Analytical and Philosophical,Confirmation is a deep dive by Whitley Strieber into analyzing his own alien abduction implant evidence; comparisons with other ufo encounter cases and philosophical conjecture on what this phenomenon means for himself as well as the rest of humanity.
1,For True Believers only.,"I hoped for some teeth behind this book's subtitle. I hoped that at last Streiber would be able to convince those not afflicted with the dogmatic wish-fulfillment and narrow-minded faith of the True Believers. I hoped to be convinced that this entire ""Communion"" series was something more than a wily way for a 2nd-tier horror writer to get rich off the True Believers.But no. It's still a load of dingo's kidneys and another series of fat royalty checks for Whitney.His ""hard evidence"" is neither, something even the most die-hard believers should be able to see.""Confirmation"" offers nothing that will shake the faith of those who are convinced Strieber is right. It also offers nothing that will sway those who think he is either wrong yet earnest, or a charlatan. In the end, it is a bit like a religious faith. To non-believers, no proof is possible. To believers, none is necessary."
3,Better than the average UFO book,"Confirmation has what most other UFO books lack: photographic evidence. Still this book isn't the greatest, as is most UFO ""literature."""
1,Some evidence...,"When the title of your book is ""Confirmation: The Hard Evidence of Aliens Among Us"" it would probably be a good idea to produce some hard evidence. This book is the loosest of innuendo; the shakiest of suppositions; and probably hurts more than helps the UFO movement. The so-called ""hard evidence"" - the shards of foreign materials found in a few people are classified as alien, even though not one of them is of a foreign substance not found in nature. I love a good UFO tale, but this book proves absolutely nothing and isn't even a provocative read. Whitley has completely milked the alien abduction genre, and I'm sure he's not done... It's been too profitable!"
2,Unidentified Flying Facts.,"I bought this book for $3.00 at a clearance. (Should have known then). The author includes innumerable cases of ""encounters"", ""abductions"", ""implants"" and ""sightings"" but at the same time , makes disclaimers about all of them leaving you feel that he is not sincere about what he is writing and wondering why he bothered with the book. I've read that his other books are much better. This must have been one of the ""lost time "" episodes he describes during an abduction. This is strictly for the Mulders out there who have ""I want to believe"" posters on there office wall. These are all the typical alien suspicions you have already read and left you laughing."
4,Good but needed better pictures.,I enjoyed the book very much but the pictured that were in there were of very poor quality and subject matter. c'mon with the point that your trying to make you should at least use the best quality pictures possible.Thats my only complaint other than that the book was great.
3,Needs editing,"The other reviewers are quite complimentary, but I thought that the book rambled. The message was clear after the first two hundred pages or so. It is an important message, but was all the information about his father central to the point that we all make accommodations to survive? Also, is it realistic to assume that the narrator has become liberated at the end or is he simply bound to create and accrue other arrangements?The book seemed like a 250 page book extended to 500 pages. Interesting references to the narrator's Communist activities. They seemed like gratuitous inclusions until I was told about the author's past with the McCarthy hearings."
3,"fun toy, but breaks easily","The heartbeat part stopped working after a day when my 10lb. puppy shook it, but it's still his favorite toy because of the beanbag noise inside, and the pocket that used to hold the heart contraption which now holds biscuits. I've heard of other people putting small clocks in their dog's kennel, which has the same effect, so I might just replace the original heart with a clock surrogate. Kind of expensive for something that turned into a basic pocket toy, but he does love it. Just don't expect it to work too long."
1,comfort pals real dog feel heart.,"I was very disappointed with this product it only worked for a couple of hours,then we couldn't get a heartbeat,so now all the puppy does is shake it around."
5,one of the most helpful books I've owned,I've had this book since I first started learning English and it has taken me through all the stages of mastering the language. I'm now as fluent with the language as any non-native speaker can be and I'm still using it when I edit the graduate-level papers of other non-native and even native speakers. I recommend it to anyone who's really serious about learning English.
3,Absolutely hilarious .... great story,"Excellent reading. Touches the southern thing well, creates a great story line, and well worth the read. I hope to read other books by Nordan."
4,Enjoyable book,I enjoyed this book. It had a lot of interesting characters and I never knew where the story was headed next.
3,Almost wonderful,"This novel starts and ends well, but it's tedious in the middle. Somewhat plotless and episodic; the characters are eccentric enough, though, to make it interesting."
4,A narrative with a strong feminine touch,"This book is very good for the female readers. The writing is very extensively pulled like a (sour)dough purposedly put in a llama ranch to grow instead of being put in an oven to be baked crackingly crispy. The readers in other gender might find it very difficult to be focused, if it is not enforced by their English professor to finish it patiently to get a grade. Living and growing up in the South like Leroy's boring teenage is an experience I could skip with no big deal. A very pretentious writing style like old Faulkner at the same age as the writer himself"
4,Excellent foundation reading - a little out of date,"Jim Hayward was the first to write a specialised work on Lovebirds in England. He has to my personal knowledge extensive first hand experience of the genus.Good advice on all relevant aspects of keeping these birds.Since it was written many new mutations have appeared which are not covered.A few improvements in management techniques have been developed since publication, but following this book will give you an excellent start."
3,Caveat Emptor,I merely wish to point out that this download is merely a REVIEW of the book and NOT the book itself (which is currently out of print and going for over $150 used on ebay).
3,Ice Bandanna's,I wear these when I play golf on those hot and humid days. The work ok but the small thin ice packs melt in less than 1/2 hour. Sometimes it takes 6 of the ice packs to get me through a round. The packs are also a bit of a pain to poke into the bandanna. The concept is good but they are a bit awkward to use.
2,good idea,I bought two of these thinking they would work much better than the cheaper neck bands that require soaking. These ice packs are too wide to wear around my neck. They don't cool me down like the crystal based coolers.
2,doesn't stay cold too long,Doesn't stay cold very long ice strips are too small to cool you down. wouldn't recommend this product good idea just doesn't work
3,"Good, but some ice cubes will break-Be careful","I purchased the Ice bandana replacement to go with my Icey cool bandana for my tonsillectomy. I found this product to be very good and soothing to my throat. But, whenever I put the replacement packs in the freezer one or two of the little segments that holds the water will break and leak water. The breakages mostly happend in the middle. Just be careful with them. It would be a good product it the plastic was more stronger. It will stay cold for about 30 minutes."
2,waste of money,"Ok so it cools, but just barely. Ice pack only stays frozen for about 30 minutes in the 95 degree heat we have been having."
5,Theyre COOL!,"Very nice replacement for the Bandanas for when they melt, and just to have in the freezer in case you need ice. You can wrap them in any type of cloth.Customer service is very nice also when I contacted them."
3,Chillin' like a villian,"Got these for my pre menopausal girlfriend... They freeze up nicely and stay cool for a good half hour. For her, any cooling relief is welcome. Only snafu was that when dropped, a couple of the frozen squares ruptured and the liquid ran out.... but the remaining sections are still good. Works well in a simple bandana or neckerchief around the neck, or she wears them as headbands around the house...! Go figure!"
4,Great CD!!,"This is a really great CD by Martha Munizzi. Apparently, Israel Houghton is her MD on this and he produces greatness as usual! If you want high energy and praise, this is for you!"
2,Martha's CD,"I'm glad you asked, because I had a problem with the CD - It is getting stuck on No. 11 song."
3,She's OK,This recording is very good from a spiritual standpoint although her voice is weak on some songs. I had heard she had a powerful voice but I did not find it to be so. Yet there is an anointing on her life and the message does get through.
5,Anointed,No other word can describe the powerful anointing on this CD. I have found myself crying and worshiping God on the way to work (on a few occasions)while listening to this CD. A must have for pure worship fans.
3,Little to do with the vampire,"I was disappointed in this book. The book itself covers very little about the vampire's life and more about the human people he comes into contact with. Which is a shame because the main character is someone I would have liked the author to tell more about. There are 3 stages. The first covers the main character before he becomes a vampire, the 2nd mainly covers a doctor in Haiti, and the last covers a young girl in present time. It left me wanting to know more about the vampire."
5,Vegetable Gardening in Florida,"Being new to gardening it has been a chore finding books I can understand about gardening. Many make promises but don't deliver information in a senible manner and I end up more frustrated than satisfied. This one delivers. The thing I love about this book is its simple easily understandable format. The book is loaded with color photographs that help me distinguish the different kinds of problems plants suffer from, making it a simple process in learning how to care for my plants and exactly what may be the problem.I like the way he layed out the charts in the back of the book. One section for cold crops and one section for winter crops. He even has a section for herbs! It takes the work out of thumbing through page after page, book after book, of when, what and where I can grow things. Thanks, Mr. Stephens, for taking the mystery out of vegetable gardening and making my life a little easier and a lot simplier."
4,Great Garden book,"Last year I purchased a winter home in FloridaI am excited at the idea of growing fresh vegatables in January. However, the soil surrounding my new home seems to be 90% sand. As a midwesterner I am used to rich loamy dirt so I know I have a lot to learn about gardening in Florida. VEGATABLE GARDENING IN FLORIDA has information about composting, rain barrels, container gardening and much more that will be helpful to me. It contains lists of plants that will do well in my area and gives the approximate planting dates as well as yeild.I am looking forward to planting tomatoes, onions and lettuce in January."
5,Vegetable Gardening in Florida is very useful!,This book is a must have for anyone who wants to know what and when to plant in Florida. It is a very user friendly book and has lots of good photos along with lots of good information. My porch roof leaked and mine got wet and ruined and I immediately ordered a new one. I would not be without it!
1,Never got it,"Although I would love to review this product, I NEVER RECEIVED IT! NEVER GOT IT, NEVER GOT IT, NEVER GOT IT."
3,Keep politics out of world music,"I purchased this book because I wanted a guide to unfamiliar (for me) world music. It is wide ranging and if browsed quickly, appears encyclopedic. Imagine my surprise when I searched for Israel and find NOTHING. There is a large section on Palestinian music, which is rife with anti Israel rhetoric. Music is a universal language. All cultures have much to offer of interest. Music is a force for peaceful interaction among people of different cultures. Even peoples whose politics are in conflict have found common ground through musical expression. I am dissapointed that a book with such promise turns out to be an outlet for some of the contributors political views. I write this not merely because I disagree with the point of view of the editors: I feel we should KEEP POLITICS OUT OF WORLD MUSIC."
2,Not so deep,"I thougth it was more informative but, it is not so deep. It is very small and in many cases it does not solve many doubts"
2,VERY Disappointed!!!,OHHH NO THEY DIDN'T!!: The fragrance formula has changed and doesn't last as long as the original I purchased in the 80s. PLEASE BRING BACK the old skool formula because it was delightfully sexy. PACO RABANNE misses the mark for sensuality now. Can anyone tell me why manufacturers keep trying to fix things that aren't broken???
3,Band of Angels,"The shipping took more than 15 days. The typeface is very small. However, I am glad to get a good price and the binding is tight. It will definitely serve my purpose, that is for review in my book club."
2,Ok doll,"My little girl wanted this doll, and what a disappointment. They like to pretend with them, but can't redress this doll in any other clothes because of the big hump on her back. The spinning aspect of the doll was fun for a short while, but when is boils down to it they'd rather just play with a barbie without any of those frills."
2,not what i thought !,"It's a fun toy to play around with but it wasent what i thought it would be, i was a little dissapointed because i thought i could make the doll do a baton twirling routine that i made up but it's not like that , there's a lever that you attach to the back of it and you just push on it and the stupid doll just moves her arms around, she doesent really twirl the baton that much , all in all it's still kind of fun to mess around with ."
3,"The overal material of the book is excellent. However,",The hardcopy version that I have very poorly bounded. The entire hard cover fell off within two weeks. I don't buy a book to let it sit. I study in it and I am very disappointed with the material used to make the bible but the information inside is very well put together even if it is difficult at first to know where to go when your colum is not finished.
5,All you ever wanted to know about assessment.,"This book is a user friendly resource that will tell you everything you always wanted to know about assessment, but were afraid to ask because of a fear of being snowed under by a bunch of pedantic mumbo-jumbo.Whether you are a counselor or special ed. teacher ( I am in training for the former, currently employed as the latter), this book takes a comprehensive look at assessment as a whole, involving families, reliability and validity, and a section in each chapter ""what shapes our views.""Excellent text, and reference. This was an ""optional book"" in our LD class; should have been required."
5,"not just a member, but a fan too","Having collaborated with these guys before, I can tell you that they're a class act... This CD is flawless, the music is energetic, powerful, and moving. Not to mention fun. Trust me, get it, love it. Make your friends listen. Make them buy it.Thanks for listening,Debra Yourman"
1,all my best friends love this album! xoxoxoxo PHT!!!,"lets all have a toast to PHT!!! if you like gettin wasted and listening to some music that sounds just like DMB this band is for you, three cheers for alcohol! it really is enjoyable but you have to be drunk."
5,Good Buy,"A good harwearing coat, great value, maybe best to remove the 'ultra force' badge unless you are a child.good chunky solid zip, a great addtion to the wardrobe"
4,good item,This item was okay. I got it for my father as a gift and I wish there was someway to let me test the sizes more. The size given in here does not accurately match peoples. Other than that item is good in quality a d purposes.
2,Tooo Large,"Not too good...it came WAY too large and its a lot thicker material than it seems, needs to change its Sizing."
2,Bad service for return,"Unfortuneately, the vendor and I had a difficulty with the description of the item, and what I received. They would not offer, nor allow a return. Since then,I have already issued a review--which prompted them (several weeks after the problem was pointed out to them)to respond. The nature of my negative review prompted them to offer a return acceptance of the item if I would remove the negative review. I advised that I could not alter the facts. Their response was to tell me to enjoy the jacket. I had already donated it to the Homeless Shelter by that time."
1,Not worth it...save your money,"This jacket is total dissapointment. Should have known better since its made in china. Really poor quality,texture, and the sizes are way too big. I returned it back to the seller and they are charging restocking fee and shipping. Save your money and shop somewhere else and buy the real thing. this jacket is nothing close to a military issued jacket."
4,Nice jacket but Rothco has to review their size charts,"I like the style, material and thickness, the colour is great and overall looks great. The only problem is that it is too big. The sizes are bigger than what they show, be careful with that."
4,Great Jacket,"I love this jacket, the only reason it isn't getting 5 stars is because of the size. Like all other reviews say, this jacket runs on the large size. i usually hover between the medium and large so i got the medium from reviews. I could have gotten the small and still been ok. Once again i love this jacket and the size issue wasn't enough for me to go through the returning process"
4,M-65 Jacket Review,"The manufacturer of this jacket did a good job recreating the original M-65 jacket I wore during the late 1960's while serving with the US Army. After my discharge from active duty I brought home with me the M-65 jacket and two cold weather liners, one light weight and the other a heavy weight. These liners fit the original army issue jacket perfectly. The newly purchased M-65 has a problem. The buttons inside the jacket do not line up with the button holes on the army issue liners. I made absolutely certain the newly purchased M-65 was the exact size as my original army field jacket and the two cold weather liners. The exact size for all items is Large Regular. The newly purchased M-65 without the liners is fine. If you want to bring back memories of your old military days, this is the jacket for you. You won't be disappointed."
2,Great M-65 Replica but WAAAAAY too big.,It's a nice M-65 type jacket but it's massive. The sleeves are a good 6 inches past the tips of my fingers. I had to roll the sleeves back quite a bit. I think that I could have gotten away with a medium on this jacket. Don't trust the sizing charts on this jacket. I read elsewhere on Amazon that you should order about two sizes smaller than what you usually wear for this particular brand of M-65 and I agree.
3,okay,"I bought it as a gift, so I've never worn the jacket, but it had everything I needed it to have, plus more. It was worth every penny."
1,P.S.,"And may I elaborate a little more? Boyd cats are marked with a big B and Mosser cats with an M. How she missed seeing these beacons of identity is beyond me. For example, the crouching cat she identified as BOYD is Mosser with an obvious M imprinted on the pontil and/or rump. The kitten on pillow (by BOYD) came in 46 colors . She writes that the example is a hard to find color. What color is it? What are the other colors?This book is a waste of money. I would try to sell it but would not want to spread false, erroneous information to the well-meaning reader collector of cute collectible kitties! =^..^="
3,Caollectible cats Review,"This is a very enjoyable, pretty pictures-only sort of book. I only wish the author had put in some pictures of marks to help with the figurine identification. I still was able to identify a couple of my own using this book. Great deal for the money! I am currently trying to get an edition of the first book. Lots of stuff I haven't seen before in here. I like it!"
1,Disappointed,"I looked around for a while before deciding to buy this ice bandana. It sounded great but I'm disappointed with the actual product for several reasons, mainly because it doesn't work well. I can barely feel the ice in the bandana unless I tie the bandana really tight, which isn't very comfortable. Also, the black terry cloth on the inside of the bandana leaves black residue all around my neck if I'm sweaty."
5,Works Great,"I highly recommend this product for keeping cool in extreme heat. I recommend not purchasing extra ice packs because in the Louisiana heat they only last about 35-40 minutes. I found that inserting ice cubes right out of the refrigerator made this product very effective. The trick is to use this item as a head band instead of a neck band and slat the back tie end down so as the ice cubes melt, the cold water drips down and keeps you super cool. I've been working in a heat index of 107 Degrees and this headband has been a lifesaver."
1,Made the wearer hotter,"I gave this as a gift to someone who works in a hot office without A/C.She told me later that it only made her hotter because the cold doesn't penetrate the material and the cloth only insulated her neck.Sadly, just wasn't what I was hoping for."
3,It's A Wrap,The wrap is ok. It is made of a thicker material that is suppose to insulate the ice better and so you don't get wet. It wasn't as cold as I had hoped it to be because of the thickness. It felt a little bulky around my neck. The quality of the material is good. The comfortability is ok. If I were to get another one it wouldn't be this one. I felt like I was wearing a dog collar.
3,Not the best,"I have recently purchased this book, aswell as others. I have found that because it is unofficial it lacks in information and colour photo's. It does have questions - multiple choice - which can be fun. The Watcher's Guide - official is much better with cool info."
1,This book is a deffinate must NOT have (i give it a -10),"it totally sucked....i mean in some of the quizzes they were asking questions about different topics. it's like hello person...you're supossed to be writting about ""buffy"" NOT about legends and draculla and frankenstien...the pics werent even that great either..they had pics from like old movies that had absoluty nothing to do with buffy. All in all it REALLY sucked....(but the cover is cool..at least it has color)!"
1,it sucked,"i believe that this is the crappiest buffy book ever, it barely had anything to do w/the series and was too much about the actual on demons dont buy it."
2,Great cover. Very poor content,"With the popularity of the series, books like this are bound to be published. However as a big fan of the series, I found very little actually related to the series or its stars. In fact,the author's episode summaries were almost unrecognizeable from his descriptions.Details focus more on the mythiology of the monsters various episodes portrayed than any further insght into the episodes or its production. I expect something called GUIDE to be specific to the show.Like I say WONDERFUL COVER. A few nice pictures inside. But I didnt learn anything new. And skipped over alot of the text which he tried very hard to tie in with any specific episode--and failed.Not worth the money."
4,Not as good as the Watcher's Guides,"On the one hand, this really isn't that bad of a companion volume to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer television series. By the standard of such things ""The Buffy Chronicles"" is clearly above average. The problem is that ""The Watcher's Guide"" is THE standard by which all such works should be judged. There are a few things you get from this one that aren't in the ""official companion,"" and a true fan will not mind having both on their shelf. But if you only get one, this ain't it boys and girls."
1,Buffy Chronicles: the Unofficial Guide to Buffy the Vampire,UNOFFICIAL is right! Please don't even bother. This book contains nothing that a true Buffy fan doesn't already know. It has no real info on the show and some of the mythology and legends it talks about are in direct contradiction with the show's mythology. If you want an episode guide with lots of extras get the Watcher's Guide.
5,Brings out the Buffanatic,"Finally got to read this one (bless mid-term break, right?!) and just had to say what a terrific job it is. All too often, this type of book is all hype and glitz, like a bunch of magazine articles just condensed and shoved together inside a set of covers. Genge definitely spent some ""quality time"" on this one. I'm one big time fan, of _Buffy_ and all the other quality vampire stuff out there, and this book still surprised me on every other page with brand new information. I've read lots of ""guide-to"" books, but this is probably the first that gave me -more- to think about after the show's credits roll. It even makes watching the re-runs fun! Highly recommend this one."
4,Ticket to tomorrow,"Annie's heart ache and excitement at being at the Chicago World's Fair pulls you into her story, but her intelligent yet warm approach to solving problems and a frightful mystery having you hoping for the best."
3,"A quick, fun read","Set during the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, the author blended romance, intrigue, and history. Though the plot was bit predictable and the mystery easily solved, Cox did a fine job of drawing her readers in through her likeable characters. She also did an excellent job of describing the World's Fair; I felt like I was there myself!All in all it was a quick, fun read."
4,An interesting read!,"A Ticket to Tomorrow is full of many elements that make up a great story--a sweet romance, mystery, suspense, political intrigue, history, and family drama. I found it to be a very enjoyable story. I especially liked the character of Mrs. Purvis (her knocking on the walls)and her obvious attempts to ""woo"" and interest Silas. I couldn't help but chuckle over this sweet grandfatherly type man, with no interest in women whatsoever, trying to avoid her advances.I enjoyed seeing and learning about the World's Fair through the eyes of the characters. I am intrigued to read more by Ms. Cox and to see what comes next in this series."
1,Such a disappointment,I really enjoy Clare McNally's books but I was so disappointed by this book. There was so little suspense and it was a very dull and unimagative ghost story. I would not recommend this book to anyone. All of her other books are great. This one is a big disappointment.
2,A lot of things are cropped out on this poster,"I did not look closely enough at the poster image, but was too happy to see the low price on this poster. Unfortunately when it arrived, all my students, who are doing a project on identifying and reporting on figures in the painting, quickly pointed out that lots of them are cropped out of this one. You are missing a number of figures on the left and right, and also some beneath the lower boundary also. If you don't care about those, the quality is good for the price, but I definitely regret ordering it. I'll just give it away or put it in a sleeve and throw it in the classroom closet."
1,One of the blandest CDs in my collection,"I've had 2 of this band's CDs in my collection for years and never really listened to them until more recently. In short, they are both very much by the numbers ""tough guy"" hardcore. The thing is, is that the frontman sounds completely unmenacing and the instrumentals are über plain. The ""instrumental track"" (more just guitar feedback) is the worst I've ever heard. I really don't understand why this band lasted long enough to warrant two albums."
1,Rude Awaking - Lite,"Bought this thinking that maybe there was some new footage from the old Megadeth years, but this turned out to be the EXACT same footage as on Rude Awakening! Same exact show!A few differences, I suppose: Less than 1/2 the content (10 tracks instead of 23), cheaper ($12.99 vs $14.99) w/o any of the extras. To top it off, the set list is completely out of order! Shame on you, Sony/BMG! Don't be duped by this ripoff money grab. If you want old Megadeth, run, don't walk, away from this and pickup Rude Awakening instead!"
2,Cheat,"What would you think when you look at this page and see a new DVD from Megadeth for sale which claims ""Megadeth Live 2007""? Well, since the page doesn't show any information about it (or at least nothing USEFUL) you may believe (surely) that it has good pieces from their past tour...Truth is that the only thing this DVD has, is some songs from Rude Awakening, aka, the tour of ""The World Needs a Hero"". For those who would like to know, the set list is this:-In my darkest hour-Hangar 18-Symphony of destruction-Trust-Peace sells-Dread and the fugitive mind-Wake up dead-Reckoning day-Devil's Island-Return to hangar 18Really, the music and the sound quality is not bad, but hey, why put a sorry selection of old songs when there is already a whole show from that era available on DVD?? and why this information is not on this page???Two stars because of the undeniable quality of Megadeth music, but this is not really worth buying, since the whole show is a far better option."
1,I felt cheated!,"In the product description, it states ""This genuine Panasonic rechargeable battery is an ideal replacement for your Panasonic cordless phone."". What ended up in my hand is an unknown brand 3rd party battery. Furthermore, in the technical details, it states ""3.6-volts, 1000-mAh"". The one I received only has 900 mA! This is not a honest business."
5,Panasonic P-P510A Replacement Rechargeable Battery,"The new battery is working great (no problems). Shipping charges were more than the battery, however, it was still a better deal to buy it online than locally."
5,Just what I was looking for,My elderly mother was looking for body powder. The stores around here are not selling much powder anymore. When I saw this item on Amazon I immediately bought this. My mother loves it. It has a lovely scent.Would buy it again.
1,Old outdated and changed,"Back years ago this scent was somewhat ok, I remember having a small bottle of it someone gave me.I thought I would enjoy it again so asked for it as a gift.I was wrong.It was heavy and gave me somewhat of a headache.It's to old lady like.And very musky.I wouldn't recommend this scent.I sold it on ebay.I have noticed yellow or golden colors of perfume are too strong and musky."
4,xmas present,Will score points with the future mother in law and make my girlfriend happy. Liz could fix anything I guess.!
5,THE JOINT!!!,JUST LOVE THE SMELL OF MY PERFUME ANYTHING THAT IS WHITE DIAMOND I BUY I JUST THINK IT IS AWESOME AND IT ARRIVED EARLY!!!
5,Excellent product !I have used,I have used White Diamonds for years and love it. Good Product !I would recommend it to every woman and have them give it a try !
3,White Diamonds powder,The powder is wonderful. I have been unable to find it in stores so went looking for it on-line. I was very pleased to find it at a reasonable price. The picture is misleading. I thought I was ordering the powder in the container. The product shipped was the white powder refill without the container.
4,White Diamonds by Elizabeth taylor,"Good product at a great price. Took a while to arrive, but made it within the time frame given."
5,Plesently pleased.,"This is a cross between crisp and sweet. It is nothing like White Diomonds at all! Its hard to give a description but it is sweet, not tart like white diamonds. Its a mellow sweet with a hint of crisp behind it. Its almost in the class of Paul Sebatians Casual if I have to give it a comparison to another scent. But don't exepct this scent to last as long as White Diamonds! Not even close! Plan on re-applying one to two hours again after first application because this scent does not go the distance. White flowers are like that and this is a white flower perfume all the way. Vetivers and moss's are the long distance runners in perfumes, not Muget's and Jonquels. This is a beautiful scent though! I recommend it to any age group and any time of day."
5,Sweet without smelling too powdery or too flowery,"You are never fully dressed until you have on some perfume. Indeed, even when wearing nothing at all (or perhaps, especially when you are wearing nothing at all) you need some perfume - sweet, alluring and sexy. For me, my most favorite scent of all is Elizabeth Taylor's White Diamonds. White Diamonds is sweet without smelling too powdery or too flowery. It has an excellent scent that lasts on my skin and smells excellent.For me and the man of my life, it's got to be White Diamonds. We highly recommend this wonderful perfume to you, or perhaps for that special lady in you life!"
2,Has a more mature scent,"I bought this item based on good reviews and now I'm regretting it! When am I going to learn to stop buying perfumes based on other people's opinions!??? I mean honestly the first thing I thought of, when I sprayed this perfume on is powder! It smells like you're in a makeup room where you powder your nose. Also this scent is more of a grandma scent in my honest opinion. I'm 19 years old and that's what I think of with this perfume. I think it's a bit too strong and mature for younger girls. I don't think guys will be attracted to the scent (At least not in my age group). This is my honest opinion and I hope I can help someone from spending their money and regretting it (like me). From now on I'm just going to buy perfumes at stores AFTER I smell them. Lesson well learned!!!"
5,unbelievable customer service so great!,I dropped my perfume bottle on the floor and it broke. about two months later I did it again. I wrote them to ask if they changed the composition of the glass because it was breaking. I received an apology letter and two new bottles of perfume. I've always used white diamonds and I've always loved it . the customer service was unbelievable I cannot remember the last time on the strength of my letter I received two bottles of perfume or anything else for that matter
5,My friends favorite,"Have purchased on three occasions. I guess she is pleased as I am asked to get her some more. I don't hesitate, just smile and say 'yes, Dear'"
2,California Waterfalls,"bought this book 3 months ago and have tried to go to four of the waterfall destinations featured. The directions were wrong to two of them (I lost about two hours at one, just driving around trying to find the trailhead). The third one, when I finally reached it, was not exactly what I would call a waterfall. I think this writer needs some lessons in how to write a guidebook. The book appears to be self-published (it's full of photographs of the author's friends, the layout is so garish it looks like it was done by a third-grader, and it is loaded with misspellings and bad punctuation). I read somewhere that this was supposed to be a ""coffee-table"" style guidebook... what a laugh. Don't waste your money on this one. Buy Shaffer's The Definitive Guide to the waterfalls of Southern and Central California. It has more waterfalls and better pictures."
5,A Class Act,"Magic without a doubt is Something Special.He was The Last Complete Player in the Game.He Could Play Position.but he Proved Himself even Bigger after He Found out he had HIV.He became an Even Bigger Winner Giving Back&Building a Bigger Foundation.this Book Deals with His Days at Michigan State,The L.A.Lakers&His Views around the League.The Man is a Champion on&off The COurt.His Smile is TImeless.A Class Act."
4,May Others Learn From His Story,"For those seeking the limelight, a must read. Be prepared for all the pitfalls that come along with the ride to fame. Inspirational autobiography of dedication and determination. May our young people keep the thought before them, that nothing comes without full commitment. Mr. Johnson has seen the highs and lows of life. There is strength in the testimony of others."
4,The Magic will never vanish!!,"A great autobiography!! Magic Johnson proved in his book that despite contracting the HIV virus in '91, his life would not stop because of it. A great life story of one of my all-time favorite pro players and one of the most charismatic basketball players ever!!"
3,Average book,I was hoping to get inspiration from Magic Johnson on how he overcome the stigma of AIDS and still lead a successful life. I did not get much information on that aspect. It is an average book.
5,A Rare and old Jun Ji-hyun Movie,"This movie is hard to find especially ones with english subtitles. A lot of movies that dont make it into the USA gets subtitled, i supposed, by some Chinese student. This one is pretty good. I have a version of Il Mare with some horrible english sub with authentic packaging. I also have a Tai Seng version with very good subs but no korean audio. So finding a korean movie like this one, that is rare, is quite a treat."
4,It's time for cyber gloom,"This is one of the best videos you'll find about gothic and industrial groups. ""Mephisto Walz"" and ""Christian Death"" always manage to make a great impact."
4,Philosophy,"In doing research on Aristotle, I found this book to be very informative. It gave his history, the works he'd done, how he had gotten started, about his family, basically wanybody that had to research on him should have gotten this book to use. Thank you for carrying it."
1,It's a mystery,"I have no idea if I'm happy this item or not!!! I still don't have this item. And I have no way of finding out if I'll get this item. It is a christmas gift to my 10 year old. I wish I had never ordered it. Now I don't know what to do. I certainly cannot postpone christmas. I will NEVER order from here again. In case anyone from this company reads this, PLEASE email me. I would cancel if I could."
3,Good introductory book on WD Gann theories,"If you are completely unaware of WD Gann's work and theories, Droke's book might be a good entry door for what concerns the ""geometrical"" part of his work. But remember, it's just the door; Mr. Gann's work is complex and far more difficult to master than the contents of this booklet may let you think.Read it and then, if still interested, go for more thorough studies."
1,Simplified? Dumbified more like it...,"I have been trading Euro/USD futures for about 2 years now. I'm not a great trader, however I believe I know a great trading book when I see one. On my bookshelf, in the trading section, I have:Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets by J.J. MurphyTechnical Analysis Explained by Martin Pring,Elliott Wave Principle by Frost & PrechterWave Principle of Human Behaviour by Robert PrechterMastering Elliot Wave by Glenn Neely45 years on Wall St, Wall Street Stock Selector, Truth of the Stock Tape, and How To make Profits in Commodities, by WD GannJapanese Candlestick Charting Methods by Steve Nison,A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton MalkielConfessions of a Futures Trader by Andrew LythgoFortune's Formula by William PoundstoneHow I made 2,000,000 in the Stock market by Nicholas DarvasYou can Be a Stock Market Genius by Joel Greenblattand the workbook from a trading course by Stewart Thallon, creator of HotTrader software...Clif Droke WON'T be joining them..."
5,Power analysis,"Classic stats book for the scientific grant writer. Excellent info and tables concerning power analyses for experimental effects. If you don't include a power analysis in your proposal, you're wasting your time..."
2,Very technical.,"I was advised to purchase this text by my research consultant (I am working on a doctoral degree). I am not a ""statistics person"", so I have found this book to be extremely technical and difficult to understand. I am sure that it is much more useful to those that are career statisticians. However, it has not done much to assist me in preparing for my dissertation study. The sample size tables are nice (which is the main reason that I purchased the book), however, even they are difficult to decipher. I would definitely recommend a different text for understanding statistics (I have liked Rovai, Baker, and Ponton's ""Social Science Research Design and Statistics"")."
3,"Great deal, cute shoe, but does not fit well","I bought the shoe in the camel color. Make sure you know your size in Charles David shoes before purchasing. They run at least a 1/2 size larger than marked. I wear 5.5 in every other brand of shoe, but 5.5 in this shoe is too big. They are also wide; bought 5.5M, but felt like a wide. I had to purchase shoe inserts to ensure that the shoes would not slip off my feet while walking in them. Otherwise, very cute shoe and great price!"
4,A wonderfully anarchic sexy little fable.,"This movie looks like a lovely fluffly cake, but inside it is filled with bugs and bizarre things! There is a great deal of sex in this movie, and it all feels feverish and vital and right. This same director did a film I saw in college called ""WR MYSTERIES OF AN ORGANISM"" and it was one of the strangest films I've ever seen- this film is like the nice little sister fable relative of it.See early film performances from Alfred Molina, Gabrielle Anwar, and Eric Stoltz. The plot is as wild as the costumes and scenery- apparently this was shot in what was Yugoslavia, and it is beautiful. Definitely worth a look, but not with the kids!"
2,"Read the book, see the movie!","This movie is a sort of a mess, but it did inspire one of the actors, Simon Callow, to write one of the best books on the process of filmmaking, ""Shooting the Actor."" His unhappy recollections are punctuated by comments by the movie's director, and the two have irreconcilable but instructive differences in discussing what actually happened on the set.So if obstreperous Balkan humor about sex and politics is your bag, this movie is as good as any other, but read Callow's book along with it, and you'll thank your lucky stars your fantasy of becoming a movie actor never came true."

1,TOSHIBA 27A45 HAS MANUFACTURING DEFECT,"GREAT PICTURE UNTIL about 40 days of using this TV it went completely DEAD. No power - nothing. Warranty was 30 days so I am in negotiation with seller. Looks like I'm screwed.There seems to be soldering defects on this model so if you haven't lost the picture yet your lucky. There is a common problem with this chassis as were in some of the older models of sony.. the Horizontal driver transformer as well as the regulator ic has a bad solder joints on them.http://www.fixya.com/problems-solutions/t103006,p202492/Toshiba-27A45-27-TV.aspxDO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK !!!"
2,took it back,Got it home and it had poor focus. The center was ok but the sides were definitely out of focus. the next morning the focus problem was gone. Go figure. The big problem for me was the time it took to change channels. A full 3 seconds. Went back to the store and found this is a common problem with tube tvs. Well I took it back and went to Walmart and got a Sanyo HT27546 for $270. Good set with quick channel change. It also has an optical digital outputwhich the Toshiba did not. The Sanyo also has a full one year warrenty. Sound on both TVs is fine. A small point. The Toshiba can not be set up to go to closed caption when you hit Mute.
4,"Toshiba 27AF45 27""",I purchase this television for my daughter's home. I'm the babysitter and got tired of watching a crappy tv every evening. This television has a very sharp picture and the viewing is very pleasurable.The only problem is with the remote control. It's to complicated. I'm sure I'll get the hang of it. The tv is wonderful.
3,"A bit dated now, but...","I bought this TV about 4 or 5 years ago and just put it in my car to take to the recycle center. With the advent of LCD no one will be in the market for one of these, but maybe Toshiba is interested. The TV worked fine up until 2 weeks ago. I must say that it stayed on damn near 24/7 from June 2007 up until November of 2009. I was no longer working so the TV was my refuge. Anyway, one night I put on the sleep timer. The next morning I turned on the TV, nothing. Pushed all kinds of buttons, disconnected, reconnected, nothing. No power. It just died. I thought a life of only 4-5 years for a Toshiba was poor, but I guess 2 years of nonstop use was pushing it..."
2,Luck of the Draw,"I shlepped this thing home and upon plugging it in found that there were large purple splotches in the corners and center of the screen which get worse and the unit warms. I know this has to do with the alignment of the beam, maybe a magnet nearby, whatever, but dunno what to do with it. Called Toshiba and was told it is my own tough luck. So I've owned it for about 2 years now. he purple splotches are annoying, but otherwise its a nice TV. Reading through the reviews here I see that essentially buying them is a crapshoot. They're either really nice or real crap. And the likelihood of getting a lemon seems around 40% which isn't too good. Look, if you're looking for a TV, look for something you're less likely to have come out a piece of rubbish. Or better yet- just get a new HDTV. It's worth it, trust me."
1,Arrived Damaged / No Returns Accepted / Still Broken,"This television arrived at my home with deep, dark grain burns in the screen from an apparent ""bad shadow mask."" Amazon does not allow returns on 27 inch televisions or larger and Toshiba has dragged their heels for a month now. They refuse to send me a new television and have (finally) arranged for a new picture tube to be installed. The repair required me to be at home for TWO different appointments with the repair service and at time of writing, I have a $300 charge on my latest credit card statement and still no television! I am a loyal customer of Amazon, having spent hundreds of dollars (if not thousands) on various merchandise and services. After this experience--no more, no how!"
5,Toshiba Tops Sony!,"THIS TV IS AWESOME, I AM USING S-VIDEO FOR CABLE AND COMPONENT FOR DVD PLAYER, THE PICTURE IS VERY SHARP , COLORS ARE BRIGHT BUT NOT OVER SATURATED, I COMPARED THIS TV NEXT TO THE SONY 27"" TV AND SAW NO DIFFERENCE EXCEPT THE $50.00 PRICE! I ALSO OWN THE TOSHIBA 20AF44 WHICH IS SUPER, NO PROBLEMS AND IT ALSO LOOKS GREAT, THIS IS THE BEST LOOKING PICTURE NEXT TO HDTV THAT YOU'LL FIND UNTIL GOING ALL ""DIGITAL"", JUST USE SOME GOOD MONSTER CABLES AND YOU WILL BE ON YOUR WAY TO GREAT HOME THEATER EXPERIENCE!"
5,Kids need to read,"Anything to make children read is a good for the mind, heart and and soul. Reading will help with other things in life."
2,Disappointing Book,"I bought this book because I liked the Murach's ASP.NET book. This was was a huge disappointment. I found their coverage of .NET concepts such as delegates and interfaces to be very weak. Their ADO.NET examples were overly simplistic. Interesting enough this book is almost a complete rehashing of their VB.NET book, almost chapter by chapter with exact same code and examples, modified of course with the different language syntax. Plus they extend this extremely simple example of an invoice application way past it's utility. I feel this is just being lazy and money grubbing. One book with code samples for VB.NET and C# at the same price would have been better for the customer. The book is poorly edited as well, referring to PERL as Pearl, etc."
5,Practical,This book presents the technical content in an easy to understand format. It has many real world type examples that have proven to be helpful in learning the basics.
5,Excellent book,"Murach's C# 2005 and Murach's ASP.NET 2.0 with C# 2005 are plainly excellent books.They are organized and presented in such a way that the reader can learn very fast and acquire a very complete knowledge about C# and ASP.NET.These books go directly to the point, in a practical way, presenting examples that can be applied to real programs. The way they are organized makes them useful for learning and for reference."
4,Best Programming Book I've Read,This book is very well organized - each topic builds on the previous topic making the learning experience easier. All other programming books I've read contain exercises and examples that don't relate to the real world. This book is different. These exercises and examples relate directly to real world situations making it much easier for me to understand how to apply what I have learned.
5,Very Pleased!,I have some background in programming (generally small utilities)and I wanted to examine C#; this book was an excellent introduction to .NET and C# in particular. I especially appreciated the database sections because I will need to develop a database for my work and would like to use this in place of my old Visual Basic 6.
4,My honest opinion,Overall this book deserves a 4 star rating. However I think the author could probably have provided shorter examples instead of one long example that could be a bit difficult to follow for beginners. I like the format!
1,Short lived battery,Be cautious of 'Equivalent Batteries'. I bought a pair of these and they only lasted a few months of casual use. I would definitely recommend buying the genuine NB-1LH Canon brand batteries.
1,Quite Disappointed,One of the two batteries was useless right out of the box. The other worked pretty well for a few months but now doesn't hold a charge for more than a few minutes. Fresh off the charger the camera is good for no more than two photos before the camera craps out.
1,Crappy Battery,Battery is very low quality. You can take maybe 5 pictures before the battery indicator light is on.
5,Canon camera batteries. Top notch,"Since the price of this two pack was modest, I did not expect too much. Original Canon batteries could no longer hold much of a charge, but were excellent in their "" youth "". These replacement batteries are better. They go a long way before they need recharging, and I take a lot of pictures. They are very slightly larger than the original, so they have to be inserted carefully. A minor thing."
5,So Far So Good,"I've only had the batteries for a couple of weeks, but so far everything is great.They fit perfectly into both my Canon PowerShot S410 and the recharging unit.The total price, including shipping was amazingly affordable at the time of my purchase.As of right now, I would recommend these to anyone looking to replace the stock battery."
1,Not a same as Canon,"I bought these batteries a couple of months ago. They seemed fine for a few weeks, but now they don't hold a charge at all. The Canon batteries are a lot more expensive, but I think I'll stick with those next time."
4,Not a perfect fit for my S400,"These batteries work right out of the box. They fit my Canon S400 well enough, but are *slightly* snug. They're easy to insert, but don't 'spring' halfway out like the stock battery. You may need to shake the camera a bit in order to get them out. The strange thing is, I checked most all dimensions on the battery with a pair of calipers, & they seem to be very close (+-.001) to the original size. Perhaps I overlooked something. Still, they're good batteries & you can't beat the price!"
3,Windows 98SE - No Issues,"Installed easily except for a brief scare where my laptop started beeping furiously after installation.. and then shut down. It did ask for the Win 98 CD but didn't seem to have issues when it wasn't provided.After reboot it worked perfectly and hasn't given me any problems.Picture is not great - and you require front lighting, but everything else works fine with Yahoo!"
4,great,"yahir is one of the best mexican singers ive ever heard this cd has alot of good songs in it, and it a fresh way to get to know roberto carlos good for him"
1,Pathetic...,"I've heard a copule of songs from this CD and Know What?, Go for the Robero Carlos originals (here in Amazon), Roberto's are actually more than worth your dollars (And Roberto is an excellent singer and is also a world recognized song writer),Regards"
1,Atrocious,"This was an extremely poor follow up to Pride and Prejudice. It rehashed the entire plot, complete with phrases from the original (with slight changes). There is no continuity between Austen's characters and the ones featured in this book. Very disappointed."
1,Presumption: Truly an Apt Title,"This sequel to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Presumption, is aptly titled. It was very presumptuous for the authors to attempt this story with apparently as little research as they did.This book is riddled with errors that a good read through the original would have rectified. Errors in ages, names, positions, family connections and character dispositions are scattered throughout the book, and each new chapter seems to bring another. These errors are jarring and distracting, and detract greatly from the story itself.The story itself, with many twists and turns, and familiar characters interwovern with new, is quick moving. It is mainly a plot story, less focused on character development than Pride and Prejudice.I would heartily recommend that one pass on reading this book if one considers the details important, or if one has read the original."
1,who is lady susan?,"The book starts out well following the story almost to a ""T"". I belive that it might be a toleratable book had they had Darcy's mothers name right. Her name was Ann not Susan. It is basicaly the same as pride and prejudice with the family honor at stake and Darcy coming to the rescue. No new plot coming at all. Basically if you have read Pride and Predjice you have read this."
1,Presumptuous,"The first page of this book reinforced my belief that no one should attempt to reproduce Jane Austen's writing style. The cumbersome results always sound as if they were written by Mr. Collins. Presumption: An Entertainment is no exception. Hopefully, someone, someday will have the good sense to keep the wonderful characters that Jane Austen created, get out of their way and allow them to tell the story. It would be that simple if the right person chose to do it."
3,What You Would Expect,"The sedate cover on this book tells the reader all they need to know about the story inside. This story examines the younger Darcy more. She must decide much as her brother did on whether she will marry for love or for duty. Her aunt of course says she must marry for duty unlike her brother. She is torn. I will let you decide how the book ends. It is touching at some points and very, very, very sweet. Diabetics beware!."
4,Could almost be Austen...,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It created a feeling, mood, and atmosphere so similar to Austen's original work that I could almost believe I was reading a long-lost manuscript she'd written. I appreciated the consistency of the characters as well as the introduction of new, very well-developed characters. While it was comforting and familiar to see Elisabeth and Darcy's relationship continue to unfold, I enjoyed the shift in focus towards Georgiana life and love games.I really enjoyed reading this book, and recommend it to any Austen fan, particularly those who loved Pride And Prejudice."
3,I liked it,"Okay, nobody is going to write Jane Austen like Jane Austen. Julia Barrett doesn't. But, having done her research and obviously loved her characters in the original novel as much as her audience did, she gives it a decent try, and what results is a thoroughly entertaining novel.Georgiana's story is well told, and there is plenty from the other characters: Mrs Bennett is hideous as ever, Lizzie and Jane continue well, Lady Catherine is on form. The new characters fit in well too - there are the balls, the intrigues, the obligatory rake, and a fair dose of irony. The ending is only as abrupt as its predecessors (let's be fair, Austen couldn't do proposals), and everyone is nicely dispatched of in the end.The only energy missing from Ms Barrett's novel is that of the Austen men: Mr Bennett is hardly allowed to surface, and Mr Collins, Bingley and Darcy have all lost a bit of colour.Nevertheless, it's a quick read and an enjoyable one."
1,an exercise in futility,"A futile attempt by the author to continue wonderful story by Jane Austen. It is perhaps a little ungracious to say that this is a terrible book, lacking warmth and insight into the hearts of minds of all the principal characters of Pride and Prejudice. Julia Barrett is better off writing a new book with fresh ideas and characters instead of writing a sequel to Pride and Prejudice. An exercise in futility indeed !"
3,"Presumptuous, indeed","This isn't the worst sequel to Pride and Prejudice I've ever read but it certainly isn't an A-level piece, either. At best, it provides enough escapist diversion to make it worth reading...if you're into Janeite literature. Unfortunately, if you're looking for a Lizzie/Darcy-centric sequel, this isn't it. This one focuses more on Georgiana than anyone else, although I do credit the novel with managing to give some page time to all of the major characters from the original novel. The depiction of Mr. and Mrs. Collins is particularly entertaining and Lady Catherine de Bourgh is, as usual, in top form. Be forewarned that there are some quite outlandish plot twists that seem downright silly. But all-in-all, it's worth a read. But only if you're into this sort of thing....."
2,Not a fitting or particularly entertaining sequel,"If you want to read about Elizabeth and Darcy, this isn't the book for you. As a Jane Austen fan and a fan of the A&E movie with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, I was very disappointed in the book. The focus of the book is on Darcy's sister Georgiana, and Lizzie and Darcy take a back seat to her romantic wanderings. If she has learned much from Elizabeth, as stated in the final chapter in Pride and Prejudice, it isn't evident here. The authors also drag the poor Bennets through even more mud than Lydia's elopement did. The best part of the book is what happened to Caroline Bingley; a fitting end for the snobbish sister."
2,Not recommended to Jane Austen fans,"Those of you who have read Pride an Prejudice and are excited to find a sequel to the book, I suggest you forget about this one. I expected this book to focus on the lives of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy but this is too focused on Georgiana. Elizabeth is missing for more than half of the book and it doesn't go into details. For example, in Pride and Prejudice, it tells how Mr. Darcy is falling in love with Elizabeth while Presumption doesn't even explain how James Leigh-Cooper falls in love with Georgiana. He just says he has loved her from when they first met. If you're a Jane Austen fan I recommend you not to read it."
2,Varies from Austen's implications,"While Presumption is true to Jane Austen in many respects, there are too many errors and recharacterizations. Though this is a sequel to Pride and Prejudice, the author(s) spend little time on the main characters. Elizabeth is fearful of meeting Darcy's mentor and life-long friend, which is hardly likely considering her fearlessness in P&P. The novel focuses on Georgiana, who seems to be rather uninteresting. I suppose it is fitting that she ends up with someone equally dull..... The whole idea of marrying below one's station was already canvased in P&P, making it a bit redundant. Those who are well aquainted with Jane Austen are better off not reading this book."
5,Jane Austen would be proud to have isnspired such writing!,"By the first chapter I knew this was not to disappoint! The language is very Austenesque and the wit is extremely enjoyable. The new characters are interesting and the classic P&P characters are loveable as ever. Georgianna channels a bit more of Elizabeth than expected but was fitting for this story. This is definitely a Georgianna story more than a Lizzy and Darcy -- but entertaining just the same. (The ending, however, wraps up very quickly-- almost too quickly.) I enjoyed this so much I found myself reading complete passages aloud! I believe Jane Austen would have been proud to have inspired such a novel."
2,NOTHING LIKE JANE AUSTEN!!!!!!!!!,"This book is nothing like that of Jane Autens. I was sadly disapointed in finding that the ending was rushed and that the book was not focused on the main plot (in fact most of the book is focused on the side plots or some tiny detail that was not at all important to the book) The main character was not really the ""main character"" because the author wrote about what many of the other characters (less important) were thinking and feeling. It also felt like the author was as dull in reading it as I was, for she rushed the ending and seemed like she was glad to have finished the book. She should have left it alone and let Pride and Prejudice rest with the happy thoughts of all faithful Jane Austen fans. I strongly sugest that you do not get this book!!!!"
3,"Mediocre, but entertaining","I found this to be an entertaining sequel to P&P, but superficial. It was a flattering rendition of what may have been and better than Tennant's by far. However, I was glad to rent it from the library and return it later. It follows the family after the marriage of Lizzy and Darcy and they still seem so distant. Georgiana is an interesting character and I enjoyed seeing a sunshiney view of the future for the characters, but as for in depth plot twists and intrigue, I am still searching for a ""perfect"" P&P sequel."
1,Presumption....better not,"I love Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, and I like the fact there there can be many interpretations to the ending. This was not one of the endings I would have considered and do not find interesting in the least. The reviewers said it was funny... but I dont see why...and really deserves about 1 1/2 stars, but since it is coming from such a great story I had to give it the extra 1/2 point."
2,Good idea poor execution,"I felt that while the concept of the book was good, it was poorly developed and didn't flow. The end completely took me off guard. I felt that the writer got tired at the end and instead of creating a proper ending, just shoved something together so she could finish.Too many of the characters did things that were out of character. The writing style was Austen like, but I would have prefered reading sequels that are perhaps less Austen like in style and more Austen like in spirit."
2,(attempted) style and no substance,"At first glance this book about Georgiana Darcy appears to follow in the Austen style. The author tries to capture the witty writing, she attempts to remain faithful to the familiar characters while introducing new ones of the same fashion, and she fills her story with the little intrigues and romances that all manage to tie into one another in the end. However, PRESUMPTION was disappointingly lacking in sophistication and heart. The story operated on only one level so it wasn't much more than a period romance. The characterizations were a bit flat so I never felt any real warmth towards Barrett's Darcys, Bennets, and Bingleys or any real interest in their new friends and enemies. All in all, this book felt tedious even though it was a fast read. Perhaps it was too fast a read because there wasn't anything to make you stop and think."
4,Good concept,"I really like this litter pan it is super big though, almost too big for our rabbit cage. My rabbit can get it off the side of the cage though which was my main reason for purchasing."
2,disappointed,"I like the measuring cup for it's markings, weight & ease of pouring. I may have a ""lemon"", but mine has several cracks around the bottom of the cup. Each time I use it in the microwave, there are more. One of my selection criteria was that it was microwavable. None of the cracks actually leak yet, but I think well given time. I can feel them on the outside & inside with my fingernail."
2,discoloring,"This cup is plastic; I thought it would be glass. After just a week or two of use, areas of it are turning opaque or milky in color."
4,"An OK read, but very nice illustrations","Little Rascal is a simplified and shortened version of the classic Rascal. I picked it up because it was cheap and because it had wonderful illustrations. The original is a better story, but this version is much prettier.You can get the story in other places. In a nutshell, it's a collection of remembrances of the author's experiences raising a young raccoon. In this form, it feels somewhat chopped up and glued together. It doesn't flow and doesn't really pull the reader into the story. If you really want to care about the raccoon and learn about growing up in the country during World War I, then known as the Great War (not so great, actually), you're better off reading the original.However, if you can appreciate true-to-life hand-drawn art that is brilliantly rendered in shades of black and white, it's worth picking up this version as well."
3,ok,"This book has good ideas-it's a short, simple read. It's another book about thinking positive thoughts and looking at your fears and confronting them. The included CD skipped on the 8th track which had the 'big secret' ..so I am not fully sure what that is. I survived.Using this and other positive thoughts I opened myself up and am going on a 2nd date with a girl I met a few weeks ago. So basically the message is to think, percieve and believe and you'll get it. I know I had and still do have fears and apprehensions about stopping 'the seach' for 'the one' --this book assisted in hammering into my head that I am the one who is behind the lack in my life- and if I REALLY want something- I need to focus on it, define it, let go of fears and go get it."
4,Book and CD help you find love,"Attracting Genuine Love combines a book with a CD program to allow readers to also use guided imagery and meditations to help break down the barriers to attracting real and healthy love.Although the book tells much of what other ""law of attraction"" love books do, the CD is what makes this a special package, one that both delivers its message in words and in real experiences of going within to see why we keep attracting the wrong stuff, so we can learn how to attract the right stuff.This is a step by step program that is easy to follow, but requires some honest journaling and soul searching. If you truly want a loving relationship with someone who is healthy and functional, it is well worth the work, both inner and outer. The authors are a perfect example, too, of how true, long lasting love can be a possibility, if one does the right things to attract it."
4,Interested in Finding Love? Read This Book,"""Attracting Genuine Love..."" is an interesting , but short, read that shows people how to attract the right person into their lives. There are some helpful tips and interesting techniques that everyone can benefit from."
4,A very soothing and hopeful work,"This was an interesting read, with an emphasis on breaking patterns from your past that you may have been unaware of. The easiest way to describe what this book offers is a way to reprogram the original programming you acquired along the way up. But there aren't any really new philosophies introduced here. The basic principles are gratitude, respect and love for oneself and others and to really pay attention to the moment by moment interactions we have with ourselves and those around us. I think self love is the basic element. Though this book focuses on finding love, I found that the program could assist with any situation including work, family and other pursuits. It comes with a soothing audio cd of exercises as an accompaniment to the text. Very thoughtfully put together. Recommend."
3,Nothing New,"I requested this book on a long shot that it might have something helpful or provide some new insight. While pithy, and maybe of use to someone who has done NO reading or held discussions with friends, ""Attracting Genuine Love"" was not for me. In fact, it has taken me months to finally plow though this short book because I just did not find it interesting. If you are looking for something to listen to in the car, the CD is a way to do that; otherwise, I hopoe that there must be something better out there."
2,Alright,"I couldn't really tell if it helped or not, at first I would think it was doing something but then my milk would go down again and I was still taking the pills."
5,Wow,"I dont miss the horns at all. I mean bands that dont experiment are destined to die. Its called creativity and aquabats are full of it. yeah the horns were good but this is amazing. The synthesizers are great. i guess we should get to the songs though.Fashion Zombies-This is probably the best song they have ever made musically and lyrically. Its pokes fun at goth kids and we all hate those emo ppl dont we? And the synthesizer in this is amazing. 10/10Nerd Alert-Another great song. Love the lyrics probably one of their more amusing songs they have written. They actually make it sound like a nerdy song too. 10/10Awesome Forces-Wow totally sweet more awesome lyrics ""we are your average ordinary superhuman punishers of evil rock and roll band"" gotta love it. 10/10"
4,These reviewers don't realize theirs 3 SKA songs on this CD,"I'm not sure what these reviewers consider SKA, but Mechanical Ape!, Demolition Rickshaw!, and Waterslides are all SKA songs!!! Sure they don't have your typical horns but it's the offbeat of the guitar and keyboards that is considered SKA in the first place, the horns is just what made the Aquabats awesome in their first records but I'll let them off this time and score them a 4 stared record!!!But for future albums I hope they bring their horn section back because that was the only real dissapointment with this CD!!!"
4,"""Charge!!!"" is the best of the Aquabats!!!","I really enjoyed the older Aquabats, when most of there sound was ska. This album says so long to that genre. ""Charge"" is a Punk,hard edged Rock album with great hooks and funny lyrics. Put simply, this is a solid album.There are only two songs that I pass, the rest makes you feel Charged.Key Tracks:-Awesome Forces!-Fashion Zombies!-Meltdown!-Stuck In A Movie!-Demolition Rickshaw!-Plastic Lips!-Mechanical Ape!"
1,disapointed!,"As a fan of the first few aquabats albums, I faithfully bought ""Charge!"" hoping it would have the same great sound, however it did not. Much to my dismay I found that the aquabats had done away with ALL of their horns and replaced them with a synthasizer! Personally I think this new synth is too dominant in their new music and is just odd sounding. So if you're into that weird techno punk stuff, I guess you might want this but if you are a real ska fan or old aquabats fan try something else."
2,Security Alarm,The battery died in less than a week. I replaced the battery and it still did not work. A big waste of money!
3,Alarm,Some of these are too loud and some are not loud enough.Batteries don't seem to last long either.
4,Arithmatic made simple,"Its been a long time since I was in school,and using this book has made a world of difference. Its very easy to understand. I highly recomend it."
5,ABZ Book,We bought this book for our married daughter for her birthday and she loves it. We highly recommend it!
5,this is a RIOT!,This book is really really funny! Buy it. Buy a couple. Do NOT let the kids NEAR it!
1,Very upset when I got this one,"I read Light in the Attic when I was very young and I enjoyed it very much. I have recently added Silverstein's other poem books, Where the Sidewalk Ends and Falling Up. I have even added The Giving Tree. All were enjoyed!Then I heard about this book and the wonderful reviews. I was very disapointed! I don't think I've lost my sense of humor, but I didn't find it funny at all! Sadly, I didn't get it through here so I can't return it.I just wanted to share because my opinion of the book was so far off from everyone elses.. this book is definately only for certain people!"
1,What about no stars??,"I honor Shel Silverstein's writing for many of his children's books. However, I can not approve of this book, even for adults. I have to admit I haven't read the whole book. Years ago in a book store, my mother showed me two pages and I had no desire to see any more. The first was the S page: ""S is for Stanley, Stanley likes to kill little children."" The second was at the end where he tells children not to tell their parents they have read this book. As a parent, a teacher, and as an intelligent person who does possess a sense of humor, I do not find book this humorous at all. I am also saddened by all the raving reviews posted here."
4,Brilliant humor. . . .,Every grandparent should read this to their grand children. A perfect gift for any age group--especially for two- through four-year-olds. Not to mention an unappreciated babysitter's secret weapon.
4,"Hilarious ""children's"" book","Shel Silverstein delivers in this ""primer"" for adults. It reads like a children's book but will leave parents laughing and cringing. Older kids (9+) will also appreciate the tongue-in-cheek humor. Great read!"
5,Brilliant!,"Perhaps those who do not appreciate this book are not intelligent enough to understand the humor. This book isn't for children simply because they might not be old enough to get the jokes, not because of the nature of the material. And with anyone who wants to censor or ban books, how 'bout reading it completely before condemning it?"
5,A Treasure With Lasting Power,"I'm a babyboomer who remembers this fabulous book from my childhood dentist's waiting room back in the 60's. I thought it was great then, and am delighted that it is again available. I certainly had the intelligence not to take it seriously, and have shared it with my kids, who loved it as well..."
5,The best book of my childhood!,"I recived this book when I was about eight, and I'm not sure why I've never been arrested. This book will make even the most bitter person smile wide and true. Uncle Shelby's wicked humor cuts like a dull razor at the ups and downs of being a child, or raising one."
4,"Not quite the ""Don' t Bump the Glump"" of old days, but....","Shel delivers the raw comedy side of kidding kids without being seen as ""too"" mean! Many of the drawings are from the original Uncle Shelby's Don't Bump the Glump, and I am happy to be able to add it to my collection. Great for a quick curl up on a dark day, and let your adult mind laugh at things you would love to do to those darling munchkins. Or you already did as the babysitter!"
2,Pentax camera battery - Did not last long...,I bought the EXACT replacement battery for my Pentax camera vs a 'will fit' to get the same performance as the original battery that lasted over 4 yrs. Not so much with this one. Might be old stock that sat on the shelf or even a counterfeit but it only lasted less than a year. Very disappointing. I won't make the same mistake again. I can buy an off brand for a lot less and it will likely last just as long.
3,Carol from the Past,First disc was of the very early shows. So-so selection. Disc 2 was much better with later shows. OK for the money.
2,Very disappointed.,The Carol Burnett Show: Carol's Favorites Very boring--not good choices of episodes! I bought as a gift and both of us were disappointed.
3,Carol Burnette,Product had a few glitches but the main thing is it did not have closed caption for people with hearing difficulties.
4,"Wasnt bad, but could be better","Didnt include enough of Tim Conways skits. Too many skits that werent as funny as Tim, Carol and harvey Couldcve been better"
4,Good as always,Just as I remembered her show when it was first shown. Still very funny and a nice way to spend an evening.
1,sensationalism at its worst,"well-written and engaging, the book fails because it is merely sensationlistic. The authors have presented a very slanted case, and have failed to portray anyone in the book as a human. The leaders of the LDS church are villified and portrayed as having more influence in the secular world than they really do. The LDS church leaders become staw men that it is easy to attack because they aren't allowed to present their side. It's an entertaining read, but it is much too slanted against the LDS church to make for anything but a sensationalistic read."
1,"Unreliable, Misleading, and Sensationalistic","I followed the Hofmann case extremely closely, and know many ofthe principal figures in it -- including two of the detectives whowere at the precise center of the investigation. This book is not reliable. Nonetheless, this book should be taken with not merely a grain but several pounds of salt. Richard Turley's ""Victims"" (published by the University of Illinois Press) would be a useful corrective, if anybody out there is really interested in a balanced view that dispenses with yellow journalistic bias."
1,"Less Than A Star, Really....","To be quite honest, this book stinks. At first, the book does grasp you and you feel like ""This is a really good book, nothing bad about it."" But then, as each chapter goes further into a ""momon bashing fit"", the story deteriorates into what read as a ""I Hate Mormons"" campaign/manifesto. It feels as though the writers started not caring about what they wrote, as long as it was seen that mormons ""are bad people, becuase they are human...shame on them, shame!...."".All told, I wasted $2.50 for a used copy of this book and increased my stupidity for it."
4,Objective story of Mormon leaders deceiving their members.,"This is a compelling account based on research by authors who are careful with evidence and committed to the truth. Amazingly, Hoffman used forged documents to exploit the Mormon leaders' need to conceal their Church's true history from their members. This increased the price of his forged documents. Although the Mormon leader was a seer through whom ""secret things can be made manifest"" he was fooled and paid substantial sums. After Hoffman committed murders the Church leaders tried to obstruct justice so that they could continue their deceptions. It's a factual account of deceived deceivers in Salt Lake City."
3,A vicious attack on Mormonism,"At first sight, this appears to be an engrossing true-crime narrative. But it soon becomes evident that the real agenda of the authors is to use the crime case as an excuse for attacking the Mormon church. All of the Mormon leaders are presented as scoundrels and all of the followers are presented as fools. In short, Mormonism is demonized. The book is full of cheap shots. No stone is left unturned in the authors' quest to ridicule Mormonism. This is out of place in a true-crime book and hopelessly detracts and distracts from the narrative. We are expected to believe that two-thirds of the inhabitants of an American state are scoundrels and fools. Nonsense!"
1,"Glossy, but not well-researched and many inaccuracies.","I was involved in the events described in this book and was interviewed by one of the authors several times as he ""researched"" this tragedy. I was also interviewed by the FBI several times and testified at the preliminary hearing. As one intimately aware of the facts I can tell you that the authors were very selective in their use of the facts, and in some cases were quite inaccurate. This book recieved a big national push by its publisher, but is very much inferior to the research and writing of Sillitoe and Roberts. It is unfortunate that this book has received a much wider distribution than other more accurate and less sensationalistic works."
2,"How true is this ""story?""","I knew Mark Hoffman, the central figure in the horrible murders noted in this book. I grew up in Northern California, and moved to Salt Lake in time for my Senior year of High School. I ran Cross-Country with Mark, backpacked with him, etc. The Mark described here (including his descriptions of himself during the period that I knew him) simply doesn't match with the young man I knew so sell. For one who was ""present,"" the tale is quite unbelievable in some of its principal points. For me, this casts serious doubt on the authenticity on the entire tale as it is told here."
4,Waltons,"Was very happy with this dvd,though was surprised to see it in a cardboard case,but the disc was in great shape and it was well packaged.Would have liked it in a proper case but its only a small matter.Service was very quick and without any problems."
4,Moscow/The Great Cities,"The Great Cities/Moscow is one of twenty-five volumes in the Time-Life book series The Great Cities. Published in the 1970s, this series introduces the reader to the history, people, and character of numerous cities throughout the world. This volume presents the Moscow of the Muscovites. Topics presented include the history of Moscow, religious holidays and political celebrations throughout the year, employment and industries in the city, family life and leisure time, and plans for the future of the city; author Leo Gruliow also tells the story of Moscow as he experienced it between the 1930s and 1970s. Numerous photographs supplement the narrative; art of the Metro (the underground transportation network), the cemetery at Novodevichy Monastery, and the Bolshoi Ballet are among the topics in the picture essays. Though dated, this book is still a good overview of the most important city in Russia as it was in the days of the Cold War."
4,"And I thought ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" was naughty...","My gay brother was reading this book and I kind off ""borrowed"" it for a few nights. And I thought ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" was naughty. I wish straight erotica were written with this much passion. I especially liked ""The Boy Trap"" by Peter Z Pan."
5,gift,My firend asked me to buys this for him for Christmas at the last minute and was quite surprised it arrived so quickly and in the great condition.
1,A Poor Use of the I-Ching,"I am always amazed when one individual decides to improve on a system that took the Chinise thousands of years to complete. Mr. Sargent claims to have ""The words of the sages"" behind him, but I was very disappointed with what he did with them. The fact that he does not include any changing lines is telling. Anyone who has spent time with the I-Ching will find nothing new here. Anyone who wants to learn the I-ching would do well to find the Richard Wilhelm/Carry Baynes translation and give it the time it deserves."
1,Dubious system for deriving natal hexagram,The system used to derive the natal hexagram was created by a tantric yogi and doesn't seem to work. A more accurate and reliable method can be found in The Tao of the I Ching which also gives you a changing line for your natal hexagram if you know what time you were born. The Tao of the I Ching is hard to find but I found a copy at Ryukyu.com.
4,Great find!,"We received this be as a gift for our 2 year old boy. He has no problem getting in and out of it, and loves the ladder. He thinks the cubby holes are a place to play. So far he has not been able to sleep in it , just to darn exciting!The bed we very easy to build, and seems very sturdy. The only complaint I have is there is no room for a box spring. There is only about 17 inches of depth to it. This is fairly minor, IMO.We are very happy with this bed, and expect our son to get many years out of it."
4,Great bed for people with limited storage!,"We purchased this bed for our [...] a couple of months ago and he loves it. The only thing that bugs us is the doors not hanging straight but I think that is from the bed shifting. They hung straight for the first day or so. The under-bed storage is a huge deal for us since we rent and don't have a lot of storage options. We can fit so much stuff under there and his room can still look neat and organized. He has never had a problem with the ladders, just had to show him once and he got it. We are using a bunk board and a twin matress. I think it helped when moving him from his crib because it still gives him that crib feeling. The bed is pricey but for all you get, it is well worth it. It is one of the best purchases we have ever made. We are very pleased!"
3,NOT SAFE FOR BED JUMPERS,I should of known better with the height of this bed puts our two year old at window level in a two story house. The bed is longer for our small bedroom 10 x 10 and I can not fit it any where else but in front of the window due to closit and the door not opening. I like it fine but can not keep it due to the danger of location.
5,Love this bed!!!!,"We bought this bed for our son who was 21 months old when we got it about a month ago. He has slept in it perfectly since we got it, he has never once tried to climb out at night or nap time. He also loves to play in the bed at other times, and can climb in and out easily!!! I was really nervous that he would climb down out of the bed and try to play at ""bedtime"", but that has not happened at all. We used a piece of plywood under the mattress and that seems to work quite well. I LOVE this bed and would recommend it to anyone for a boy or girl!!!!"
5,Cool Bed!,I got this bed for my two year old and I paired it with a dinosaur bedding set. My son loves it! He thinks the open bottom is cool but I think he's still too young to fully appreciate it yet (since he doesn't want to be down there by himself). The bed is super easy to assemble took about 30 mins.
5,A thought for the sagging matresses,"OK, I haven't bought this bed..yet, but am thinking about it. The sagging doors thing bothers me since it's not made of wood and would be harder to correct. As for the mattress issue everyone is concerned about. Ditch the box spring and get a piece of 1/2"" or 3/4"" plywood to lay on the supports. The mattress will be soft enough to sleep on and you won't lose that extra 6"" or so from the box spring. Easy fix.."
4,Smooth and Accessible,"It's been years since I bought this CD, and I haven't heard much from The Falcon Project in a long, long time. Still, this is one of my favorite go-to albums for those lie-back-and-relaxe, mind-wondering moments. Mentally stimulating, even after years of play. 'New Day on the Rise' and 'Soul Divider' remain among my favorite tracks. For anyone who's looking for something fresh, maybe a band they've never given a chance to before, this album is a great intro to The Falcon Project."
1,Snoozzzzzzzzzzze,Loved her in Girls next door but this was so boring I have yet to watch the entire dvd. It's stored with the other videos from the Girls Next Door.
1,Why travel channel why ?,"I watch the travel channel a lot and enjoy most of their programming. I tried to watch this show once and after about 5 minutes of babbling and broken english by Bridget I had to change the channel. How a bimbo with the IQ of a flea can get a show is unbelievable. Once this skanks looks and body go, she will be in big trouble."
3,Slow and Steady,One of two pairs of shoes purchased.Leather is stiff and fragile / brittle (creases are distinct).Affordable and makes an acceptable pair of work shoe for everyday 9-5.Patented sole is very comfortable.Laces are stiff and doesn't remain tied well - require replacement.
1,wtf is this cam,this cam sucks....it freezes all the time. picture quality is good no offense but i have a stable os and cable internet and few progs running in the background. this stupid cam freezes every second and i reinstalled it several times. i still havent received a reply from Dlink though.
4,Not using it as a duster,"Just got this today. As many others have mentioned it's rather lacking in power compared to a big can.I'm using this to fill the head space in a jug of home-made wine with CO2. This prevents oxidation during bulk aging of the wine.For me the gentle air flow is best since it won't hit the wine and spray it all over the place. This is a reasonably cheap method of filling head space compared to buying a big CO2 system meant for beer brewing.If you're wanting to buy this for blowing out computer systems, yeah, it doesn't even make the fan noise change on my 1200W dual rail power supply."
1,Absolute total waste of time and money - buy canned air instead !!!,"Whatever you might be expecting from this product it is sure to underwhelm you. I tried it on my iphone which operates in a fairly dirty farm/ranch environment although protected by an OtterCase. The Air Dr. can barely (and I mean barely) blow the dust and dirt away from the sensitive connection areas on the phone. The capacity of the cartridge is only a few seconds and the last 50% of the life of the cartridge is at significantly reduced pressure. For the cost of a set of 4 replacement cartridges you would be much better served with canned air, a small vacuum or a small compressor. This was truly a waste of money."
1,don't waste your time,This is a horrible product. Not enough pressure and lasted maybe 4 sprays. Completely useless.
1,Do Not Buy,Unfortunately I bought this product at a store before reading reviews.Pros: -Looks pretty coolCons: -You could dust faster using your breath-Is as powerful as a canned duster that is spent-You can't change out the straw for a bike or ball pump attachment
2,"Agree, but Tbird's info works well","Get out your drill and mod this thing. It works quite well then, however it does blow through cartriges now."
4,Not great for everyone but it has it's place in my toolbox,"The reviews are right that the typical canned air at office supply stores will blow more than these. I'd argue that they don't spray quite as hard and they sometimes do release liquid. But the reason I keep using AirDr is that I don't use them that often. My canned air was always dead when I went to use it - riding around in my car in Florida must have made it leak out. These CO2 cartridges don't leak and it takes about one whole one to dust a PC.If you're cleaning 10 PCs in a row, don't buy this. If you only need it occasionally AirDr will be ready."
2,"Effective once modded, but I shouldn't have to mod it","All the reviews are right; this thing is terrible out of the box. But drilling a hole in the back of the brass nipple greatly increases airflow to respectable levels. However, I shouldn't have to take a drill bit to this thing. It should do what the description said. Two stars for lying to me."
5,"Forever, for Always, for Luther","I am truly enjoying my CD. I have always been a Luther fan, but having jazz versions of his songs is like the icing on the cake. I highly recommend the CD for jazz lovers!"
4,Indeed Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just picked up this CD and am currently listening to the track that made me rush out and get this immediately: Ledisi's version of ""My Sensitivity"" is alone, worth the price of admission!!!!! Equally impressive is Lalah Hathaway's awesome reading of ""Forever, For Always, For Love.""This is indeed a smooth, cohesive, and thoroughly enjoyable listening experience. The choice of selections as well as the interpreters are top-notch. Even the order of the songs is the best combination considering the selection choice. Of course the only complaint I have is with ""Dance With My Father"" which, while the sentiment is certainly admirable, as a song it ranks right up there with Luther's worst.But again, as a body of work, this is a high-caliber CD with wondrous performances and a more than worthy addition to your smooth jazz collection as well as an admirable tribute to one of the music industry's finest artists."
5,A True Tribute To The One and Only,"This CD is awesome. If you are a true Luther fan, you will play it over and over again. It is worth every penny! Get your candles and wine ready, sit back and relax. It's a CD you can put in your player and let it go."
3,Average.,"National Tresure 2 - Book of Secrets starring Nicholas Cage is a solid sequel but I just feel something was something this time around. The action is pretty good but the plot was a little hard to grasp. Cage is perfect in this role, not sure I can say the same thing for Helen Mirren. This film is a mixed bag for me."
4,Good quality,"Good vid and sound quality.Easy to purchase.No problems.Would do again.Great movie.Well filmed, good action and plot, fun characters, good moral to the story."
4,A good sequel,"When it comes to sequels, most are mot as good as the first, this follows that trend, but it is still a very enjouable movie."
1,Fairly lame....,"Love Nicolas Cage, but this movie only makes me more suspicious of sequels. The original was quite watchable, overall; but this one never got me ""into it"". At least I've got a Cage in my collection, now. It just wasn't very interesting, let alone exciting...sorry to say."
1,Not a good company,Got a defective DVD in the mail from them. I sent it back as instructed and they refunded my return shipping but I have yet to receive a replacement DVD.
1,Idiotic,"This is the most idiot movie and the most rediculously foolish plot. I care not to elaborate much more, but the one thing I would like to say is I don't know why an actress of Helen Mirren's stature would be in this movie."
5,Nat. Treasures 2-book of Secrets,"Book of Secrets is one of those rare sequels that actually eclipses the original. The creative writers minds have come up with another ""sit on the edge of your seat and hold on"" movie that is extremely entertaining.Well done and well worth buying for a collection at home."
4,Great family fare!,"OK, NTBOS is not a classic for the ages, but it makes for an enjoyable afternoon's entertainment. Now that I'm a grandparent I really appreciate a movie that the whole family can see. :)"
3,The sequel to National Treasure,"Was very disappointing. You could tell it was a classic ploy to rake in money without understanding what made the first movie great. Unless you are desperate, I'd forgo it. Still, it is clean. Nothing objectionable in it."
4,A good sequel!,"We really liked the first National Treasure and this one fit the bill again. Just a good plot, humorous writing, good characters, kept us giggling and on the edge of our seats."
3,National Treasure Book of Secrets,Helen Mirren made the film. She was superb as usual. Rest was just ok!
3,"Solid movie, terrific blu-ray quality, not Indiana Jones though","I love action movies and I admit it, I like Nick Cage. He is looking a bit long in the tooth lately though with the hair and plastic surgery. But still, he holds his own in action movies: The Rock, Con Air, Ghost Rider.I can't fault anyone for making a second National Treasure, as the first one was enjoyable. So when the second one came out, I missed it in the theaters, but waited for the blu-ray.The quality of the audio was amazing in my home theater, I thought we had a drip happening in our plumbing!Movie was overe all ok. The plot was ok, action was good, ending left you feeling a bit perplexed with the turn of certain characters and the obvious third installment option. You aren't getting Indiana Jones, you are getting his younger brother. But still, that aint bad!"
4,National Treasure 2,amazon always ships in good time. The movie is not as good as the first but is still well worth watching.
4,National Treasure 2,"Good movie, didn't like it as much as the first as there were some very far fetched sceens. However, if you enjoy watching a movie to be entertained as opposed to having to ""figure things out"", then this movie is worth it.My children really enjoyed it."
5,Awesome Sequel,I loved this sequel because of the flow of the story and how it managed to connect very well with the first story. The second disk has some amazing behind the scene features. I am always amazed at how some of the special effects are created and how the actors and actresses interact with the sets.
5,Get's better everytime you watch it,"If you didn't thing this was as good as the first one, give it another watch. For me, it gets better every time I watch it.The pacing is great in these movies. There's almost never a moment where you're bored, or have your mind start wondering."
2,National Treasure II. Were they serious?,"This movie combined with the bad scrip writing, the overacting and the repeated plot makes it a more of a torture device than a 'family fun' action drama. Most of the jokes aren't funny and the suspenseful parts are dull, drawn out and listless."
4,Excellent service,The merchanise that I purchased was shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition. I bought it for a gift so I have not yet opened it. Thank you.
4,National Treasure: Book of Secrets,"Movie moves at good pace, typical of a Bruckheimer film, but storyline too much like first movie.Helen Miren was great addition to cast."
4,Great movie,"I do like this movie because I do like the first one. Watching this in high definition does make a huge difference. The storyline and action/scifi is better than the first. Can't wait for part three, if any."
5,A great movie an adventure!,I loved this movie it is every bit as good as the first if not better. A great adventure. a must see!
3,Great in the beginning but loses it near the end,"If one can associate an actor to a particular genre of movies, it would be Nicholas Cage to family-friendly action - adventure movies. But sequels has been something he has smartly stayed away from, until now. With this 2nd installment of Disney's National Treasure franchise, Mr. Cage looks like he has sold himself out. The Book of Secrets starts out good but steadily becomes less believable and less original as it progresses. For example, the scene inside the mountain where he and his fellow explorers are perched atop a tilting rock platform seems to be a knockoff from the one of the final scenes from the first National Treasure movie. Also, his entry into the Oval Office seems quite lucky. Still, it is an interesting movie and worth two hours of your time."
3,Suffers badly from sequel-itis,"The first ""National Treasure"" was a romp, but this sequel tries a little too hard. Nicholas Cage repeats his role as the irrepressible treasure hunter, Benjamin Gates, with Jon Voight as his father. Ed Harris is the bad guy who changes character at the end (a Disney requirement, probably), and Harvey Keitel is pretty good as the FBI agent. Helen Mirren, unfortunately, is forgetable as Ben's mother. The plot has to do with the truth behind the Lincoln assassination (was Ben's ancestor a Booth co-conspirator?) and the search for the golden city of Cibola. The key to it all is ""the President's secret book,"" handed down from each chief executive to the next, and containing the truth of various historical mysteries. Even for this sort of Indiana Jones-ish adventure, it's all rather absurd."
5,A Real Treasure of a Movie,I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Lots of action and a great story line. Highly recommended!!!
4,Like Visiting an Old Friend,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was like visiting an old friend and getting caught up on their latest hi-jinks. As many have said, after suspending any disbelief you're in for a fast, wild, and enjoyable ride."
2,Hidden Immorality,"This movie rated a '1' (lowest) for sexual issues on one web-site and a Christian movie review web-site says that it is ""better-than-average."" Well, there are technically no 'scenes' of immorality, but the entire sub-plot was around (SPOILER) Ben Gates getting back together with his live-in girlfriend. This isn't just a little side-note, but a main point of the film. Completely distasteful and contrary to biblical morality. Don't allow the absence of actual nudity and sex lull you into thinking that the film is positive or has an OK message.Language was very clean, but other than that, the film was mostly stupid. How finding the lost city of gold would clear Ben's family name completely eluded us."
1,National Treasure 2 - Book of Secrets,This is one of the worst sequels to a movie I have seen in a while. Ridiculous premise and really a sad commentary on Nicolas Cage agreeing to make such a film given his skills. Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney should have animated this one and sent it straight to the Disney Channel. The plot line and action sequences were implausible and predictable. I would only recommend this film to someone with an Alzheimer condition.
2,Over The Top,"The first movie was ok. This one is so overdone it just seemed ridiculous. The car chase scenes go on and on. This movie was like a bad made for TV action movie.Defintely not worth buying, and isn't even worth renting."
1,...and then the president showed up,"this movie was your standard issue entertaining enough action adventure movie with good car chases and a decent enough story line and then all of a sudden the president of the united states goes off on a wild goose chase with Ben Gates underneath Mount Vernon looking for what? f*** if the president knows and then after getting taken for a ride the president of the united states gives some dude he's never heard of before who just wasted his time top secret government information and its in the library of congress? Stop, you're killing me, for real. The movie is impossible to take seriously from that point forward."
2,"History destroyed again, but without the fun","I liked the first film to some extent even though it was so bogus, but this sequel just went on forever. The plot is even more unbelievable this time around and the actors look like they are just cashing in a check. It's making a ton of money, but like I Am Legend (a better but equally flawed film) it fails to deliver the goods."
4,"Fun, action-packed sequel","Nicholas Cage is back on another treasure hunt. This time he's trying to find the fabled ""city of gold"" and at the same time exonerate his ancestor who has been accused of being part of the plot to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. The movie is full of action and is just plain fun. It has romance, adventure, car chases, narrow escapes, impossible situations, and absurd coincidences. So what? Just go with it and don't take anything in the movie too seriously since it doesn't take itself too seriously either. Nicholas Cage, Helen Mirren, and Jon Voight seemed to enjoy it, so you should just enjoy it too!"
3,Have to keep up with the series.,This is not as good as the first one but it's entertaining and you have to keep up with the series.
3,National Treasure 2; Book of Serets,"Just when I thought we'd get a GOOD sequel, (Why did I even think that??), out comes another, ""been there, done that..."" This is just too predictable.No detail like the first movie provided so well. Characters... no development... just chases, impossible situations and burns.... I could go on and on... I'd been more content just enjoying the first movie...and never knowing how poor the second one is........."
2,oh please!,"I was soo looking forward to this film, but... it lacks the historical magic and the exciting rollercoaster chase of the first, plus it presents a rather lackluster finali. I do not want to give the ending away, but PLEASE, has the author or director ever been to Mount Rushmore? A Mayan/Toltec ruin in South Dakota? Hello! History! Too farfetched for my blood. And the bickering between the main cast of charaters quickly lost it's luster.Ack, and so many plot holes. Still, it is far and away better than amnay offering sof late. I give it a C."
4,More drama than action,If you normally like sequels then you should enjoy this one. It is a more on the drama side in trying to develop a plot than the action that the first brought. Worth a watch.
4,A fun popcorn thriller,"I know that the critics are panning this movie, but I have to say that I rather enjoyed the film. It follows the same crazy blueprint of it predecessor and it still works. Of course, you'd wonder why anyone would want to bury a city of gold, but whatever. I had fun with the Gates family and I hope a third film is on the way."
5,Graet Movie,"This is a great seqil to the first. Full of action & excitment. It's fab for the whole family. All three of my kids were glued to the TV. Each new clue keeps you guessing whats going to happen next. Love nicolas Cage, love this movie"
3,entertaining,"An Indiana Jones wannabe, that unfortunately doesn't come close. Not with the special effects (huh hello? other than the City of Gold, I didn't see any), not the acting (the new cast is good but fails to bring anything to the film), not in the script (filled with goofs), not the directing and not the photography.There's nothing that catches the eye.That said, it's a film that has one goal, and that is to entertain its audience. That, in my opinion, is the only thing this movie does."
3,Picture quality not so good,"Loved the movie, but I have to say, the picture quality was not so good. It seemed to have lots of squiggly lines in both the picture and the black border. Would have to think twice before buying from that studio again."
4,"Looks fabulous, but the plot is overdone.","This movie looks awesome on 1080p Blu-ray. I'm very impressed with the display.The movie itself is entertaining enough, but falls short of its predecessor. Part of this is, of course, because the concept was already done. However, in their attempts to make this film grippingly spectacular, they went overboard. Breaking into the Queen of England's study, the President of the United States's office, and then kidnapping the President of the United States pushes unbelievable adventure to the point of absurdity. While the historical inaccuracies may mostly be missed by the majority of the audience, the idea of finding a golden Aztec city in South Dakota will jar most into a, ""Huh?!""Overall, though, this is a very entertaining movie. I did buy the Blu-ray disc after seeing the movie in the theater, so it was worth more than a second viewing."
3,Good - could have been better.,"The movie was a typical sequel. All the excitement was in the first National Treasure. This movie was entertaining and lacked a little originality - it was a bit predictable. If you're a Nicholas Cage fan, and I am, you'll like the movie. No, he's not going to get an Oscar for this one but you might want to just appreciate it for what it was-simple entertainment and not much more."
4,Enjoy this with your friends,"Loved 1st one better, but this one is good enough to watch on weekend night with friends. Well, any Nic Cage movie is great to watch with friends, just to see his face :)"
5,Great set of movies!,Love Nicholas Cage and just all over a great movie for everyone!!!!!!!Would definitely recommend for anyone amazing for all ages :)
3,As good as first,"Very entertaining, light and at times funny, Good movie without alot of thinking or concentration on the part of the viewer, nice storyline."
4,National Treasure 2,It is a good action/mystery movie but not quite as good as National Treasure. It was two predictable and kinda went flat in some parts of the film.
4,Just as Exciting!,"National Treasure 2 is just as exciting as the first one. I appreciate that these movies can also be viewed by young people - and helps to serve as a teaser to the ""real history"" of our nation (and even the world.) Fast-paced and great to watch again and again. You always see something new......."
3,"Extras are fun but the movie, not so much","I enjoyed the first movie in this series, despite my reservations (and dislike for Nicholas Cage in general who, I believe, has become sort of a caricature on the screen). It was smart and filled with extremely interesting factoids and theories about American history. This sequel fails to capture that same sense of fun, instead feeling like a rehash of the original with the express purpose of capitalizing on an emerging franchise. That being said, the extras on this DVD are fun, particularly the aforementioned bonus cartoon."
3,M-m-m Nicholas Cage!,Movie started off slow but built up to be pretty good. Can't think of much more to say than that.
2,nothing to talk about,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I loved the first one, in fact it's one of the best movies I've ever had the pleasure to watch. But this one mostly sucked, with a few good parts that made me hope more was coming. The story line is extremely stupid, the clues are completely rushed and non interesting, and the mystery is almost non existent. A lame excuse for a sequel. The bad guy in this movie is retarded. His reasons for doing what he does, and the things he does do just show you how little creative thought went into the movie and it's plot. I did find enjoyment in some segments of the movie however, so I'm not going to say it's completely unwatchable. Just take what you can get out of it and try to forget the rest. Hopefully a third movie will bring back the things that made the first one so great."
5,AWSOME MOVIE!!!!!!,This movie is one of the best created in this century!It has a great story line and has just enough action and comedy to make this a great hit in your house. Your family and friends will enjoy watching this movie over and over again.
4,"Good, Clean Fun","While not as smooth as the first installment, National Treasure 2 is a smart, fun, and clean adventure. Jon Voight is priceless as he interacts with his ex-wife. The script is witty. Loved it."
3,No Goofy Cartoon,"I enjoyed this movie, in fact I saw it twice in the theater. Having said that, one of the major reasons I saw it the second time was the Goofy cartoon ""How to set up your home theatre"" or something like that. It alone was worth the price of admission. Silly me, I thought that it would be included in this DVD. If I had known that it was not included, I would not have been in such a rush to get the DVD. If you are looking for this cartoon, keep looking. I give the movie 4 stars but take one away for the missing cartoon."
2,Stakes are low,"With a picture like this, the stakes should be high. In this case, the stakes revolve around the reputation of someone who died 140 years ago. ""I'm doing this for the reputation of my great-great grandfather."" Really? A lot of fun stuff and good cast but without having much at stake it just never gets off the ground."
4,Not a bad sequel,"National Treasure: Book of Secrets was not a bad sequel. The original National Treasure was such a unique blend of history, action, comedic moments, and suspense that this sequel was sure to be a paler copy. The history with Ben's parents was revealed; I thought the mother was dead based on Patrick's comments in the first movie. I wish the movie had a better villian. I usually love Ed Harris, but he played this role too dark for the film."
3,WHAT SECRET BOOK?,THIS WAS FUN BUT THE ORIGINAL WAS SMARTER AND MORE EXCITING! THE ENDING LEAVES YOU A LITTLE WANTING BUT OVERALL IT WAS ENJOYABLE AND INTERESTING. GATES IS A MODERN DAY INDIANA JONES.
4,Better than the TV version by far,Someone asked me to order this for them as it could not be found locally. We watched it when it came (quickly!) and were both impressed with the quality. A good buy.
5,jdofthewest,I enjoyed the dvd even more than first National Treasure. I have watched it several times. The DVD is in excellent shape. Thanks!
5,Good movie,We like this movie very much. However to have to review every movie we rent from Amazon is a pain! The stars should be enough. I'm not a movie critic.
5,Excellent story & action movie.,It's an excellent story & action movie. I love the first movie as well. It's great how it was put together & how it makes you wonder if the story is for real.
3,Some latin amercian history and geografy classes to the writers PLEASE,"This movie is funny , but do the writers and producers really believe that ""El dorado"" can be in Florida, SHAME ON YOU"
2,Lame,Dragged on and on. Very predictable. Could have been better. Don't bother with this one. Blab blah blah blah blah.
3,It's funnier than the first movie. It also has more character development.,It's funnier than the first movie. It also has more character development.In many scenes it looks very much like Davinci Code when Nicolas was trying to solve one puzzle after another. The special effects are not as interesting as those in Indiana Jones.It's worth watching once.
2,"Formula, formula, formula","Sometimes you can forgive, even appreciate, when Hollywood offers up a formulaic story that offers few surprises. This film isn't one of those instances. Pedantically predictable."
4,Better,"I'm usually not a big fan of sequals. I generally find them unnecessary, thin and uncalled for, but on my girlfriends insistance I went along to see ""National Treasure 2"", and was greatly surprised. I thought it better than the original. The plot, the feel, the acting, the pace, the music, and the design are all the same as in the first one, but, in my eyes at least, it works more well this time around. You don't really care about the mile wide leaps of faith you have to perform to make the story work right. You just lean back and let yourself be entertained.It will most definitely please fans of the first film and of course Cage fans, but I think it a good family film as well. We all like a bit of adventure now and then. 3.5 stars"
3,Not Indiana Jones,"When I ordered this DVD, I expected a fast-paced, fantastic adventure. I wasn't disappointed. I didn't expect something in the same league with the ""Indiana Jones"" series. Again, I wasn't disappointed.The ""National Treasure"" adventures are fun and a enjoyable diversion. If you like American History, you might like this one, not because it teaches you a lot but because it links the present with the past and shows the viewer that the past is still with us. The series (and I hope there are more) should stimulate further looks into our heritage. There are adventures to be found there. We really do have a wealth of National Treasure."
1,Just didn't work,"I was so optimistic with the thought of this product and at my wits end on keeping geese out of my backyard (a creek runs along my back border). I tried everything and read a review that it works. WRONG. It did not stop the geese at all. They ate right through it.I finally put up a homemade fence made out of old unused tomato cages tied together along the whole border of the creek in mine and my neighbors yards. Geese are generally lazy. If they can't walk up from the water, they don't bother coming into the yard. My grandchildren can finally play in my yard without constantly stepping or slipping in feces and I don't have to worry about my dog rolling in it."
3,A new stone age coffee table book?,"The use of stone tools in the early transition from hunting and gathering to farming is shown as archaeological evidence.We have very little written evidence from this kind of cultureexcept for the Egyptians, Mayans and Incas, but we have massive stone monuments and graves that these people left.The full color pictures and maps in this book are good.I enjoyed most of it, but it kind of left one with a decaying feeling of dead people and a fatal feeling of a doomthat wasn't there.Progress in this age was slow but steady,but these people made deserts that remain todayby cutting down all the trees for their use?Like termites in a wooden house,mankind has been to his planet."
2,Almost junk,"I give it 2 stars because, when it works it works great. I have had 2 and both have the same problems. On the first one, the keyboard on one side died and would restart after totally disconnecting the cables. Within a few days, it would do it again. The second one does the same but waits weeks before dropping the keyboard. I tried returning them but got nowhere.I do not recommend this product.Update Oct 8, 2006: The sound is now having major problems. One channel is dead on one cable and real weak on the other.I *really* don't recommend this product."
3,Sound electronic noise,"The function of the KVM is flawless, but the sound switching has a problem in that there is electronic feedback or crosstalk and you get a irritating headache causing, high pitch twang and you end up unplugging the sound cable to the KVM."
3,"Works as expected, but poor speaker quality","After installing this, I noticed one of the PC's now drives the left speaker and the other drives the right. I am not sure if this was design intent or if I got a bad unit, but it is kind of annoying. Every now and then, the mouse pointer will move erratically with no stimulus and you have to toggle between PCs to get it to stop.It gets the job done, and for the price you pay it works as good as I'd expect."
5,Switching between laptop and desktop is effortless,"Work at home productivity booster!I bought this KVM because I often bring work from home on my laptop and wanted the higher productivity of my home full size keyboard/mouse as well to use two screens (extended desktop - a major productivity enhancer!) like I do at work.Plugging in and setting up was flawless. I use a USB mouse with a PS2 adapter. The ports on the KVM are fairly tightly packed which made the connecting the PS2 adapter for the mouse rather tight but it fits and works.Now I can use the latop with dual screens or with two taps of ""Scroll Lock"" I switch to my desktop with my laptops built in Keyboard, etc. still accessible.Very glad I bought this unit."
3,Good - but...,"After purchasing this KVM switch, switching between my desktop and the laptop became so easy at home. I can use the same bigger keyboard and monitor and listen to music from either machine.Frequently the (Intelli) mouse gets stuck. Initially I used to disconnect the computer or reset. Now, I discovered that re-seating (disconnect & reconnect) the mouse cable at the KVM does the trick.Good buy for the price."
5,reliable KVM switch,"This has been a reliable KVM switch to connect a Kinesis PS/2 keyboard and Logitech Marble Mouse to a Sun workstation and Dell laptop, both of which have USB ports (but no PS/2)."
5,I loved it,"It was so good I cried because it was so impressive. No, I'm kidding, it was the best book I've ever read in my whole life. get it."
4,"hefty and strong, tangled in shipment",I'm pleased with my order but it did get tangled due to loose packaging and it took me a while to get it working. Once the chains get twisted and loose within the gears it's hard to work it straight again. Once working it does a great job for the money. I'm happy.
2,great lift no release down,"worked great lifting, but could not lower it. no instructions on how it operates or maintenence. not bad if for the reasons I mentioned."
2,gun digest book of Smith & Wesson,"Not exactly what I was looking for. It deals more with some of the more modern models and seems to be an advertising medium for the 500 S&W. I was more interested in the older models and information on them and this was a bit of a disapointment, however it does cover the models in it pretty well."
1,ZGun Digest of Smith and Wesson,I can not reccomend this book. It is incomplete at best and useless for the the Smith and Wesson collector.
3,A good basic Study of S&W Handguns,"Patrick Sweeney has taken on the task of giving an extensive review of the available handguns of Smith & Wesson. He goes into considerable depth on the practical use of the various models and what can be expected on the range, in competion and for the very serious job of Concealed Weapons Carry. Chapters on History, Ammunition, Buying Used, and Competion round this fine effort out."
2,ok only,"i bought this book hoping to check the specs on several s&w revolvers, only to find it only speaks to certain modern models. it also devotes too much space to accessories."
3,First Vibrator,"It has powerful vibrations and pretty quiet. The down sides to it was larger than i expected. Larger than the average male penis. The shape is also strange, almost a little awkward. Ive had it for about 5 months, and it is dying on me.It also has an smell from the rubber that is not pleasant at all. Have washed it many times, and the smell will not go away. It uses batteries pretty fast too. Wasn't bad for my first vibrator, but i wouldn't recommended it."
2,DWL-G510,I have the same problem of my PowerEdge 400SC freezing up while using the DWL-G510 nic. Quiet frustrating with no solution. Do not purchase DLink with Dell PowerEdge 400SC.
3,"Good song choice, but mediocre sound quality.","Most of the songs done on here were not done with even the instruments that the original artists used, so they came across as pretty cheesy, but still, it was a good selection of songs to use."
3,mostly instrumental music,"My grandchild loves this movie and I was looking forward to playing this soundtrack for her. I should have investigated the cd more closely. It's mostly the instrumental, unidentifiable background music from the film. It has the favorite song, You've Got a Friend in Me a couple of time, but that's about it. I bought it used luckily, but I'm glad I didn't pay full price."
3,Soundtrack fine - case broken,The soundtrack is fine but the case came cracked in many spots. I ended up throwing out the cd case.
3,Prompt Delivery,"Product as described and delivery as promised. Purchased for someone else and only recently delivered it to them. Have not personally used the product, but the person I purchased it for seems well satisfied."
2,Difficult to use and color is a strange version of red,I found myself having to use two hands just to get the glitter glue out of the bottle. It was next to impossible to use it to spell a name for example or draw a picture. My six year old likes it because once I get on paper she can paint with it one of her paintbrushes.
4,"""Until we split up or something""???","Love the song and the remixes, until she says that line at the end of the song. It kinda takes the enjoyment out the song. Writer R. Kelly must have been trying to finish the song before the deadline."
4,Catalyst Switch,The product as in pretty good physical condition and was delivered on time. Would definitely purchase from the seler again.
3,A book among books,I have few books which I consider to be of more value. This book includes brilliant instruction enter - mingled with history and humor. Thanks Joseph. One of your best. Your dad would be proud of your work here. :-)
4,great for beginners,"This was my first ever vibe purchase. I've always been a little squeamish at the idea but now I've definitely crossed to the other side of sexual pleasure. As far as g-spot stimulation I haven't gotten that yet, it doesn't rotate as fast as I thought it would. And when the rotation function is on it is certainly loud. On just vibrate it's relatively quiet. But man oh man the clittoral tickler is awesome! I'm in a long distance relationship and somedays I just need to have some fun even when he's not here and No. 32 is my new best friend :-)"
1,not as good as it looks,"After reviewing the other feedbacks before i bought it, i took a chance on it because not everyone is the same. After trying it for the first time, i found the clitoral stimulator to be rough and not at all pleasurable. It was very hard plastic with sharp points on the end trying to do the job. After the second time of using it very gingerly, it worked for a few seconds then it would turn itself off. I played with the buttons for turning and vibrating, but nothing happened. I tried to change the 3 AAA batteries that it requires, but it came to no effect. It was also very slim, maybe an inch in diameter or so. It hardly did any good unless it was used with another vibrator. Yes, it's cheaper than other vibrators, but other cheap ones work much better."
3,Kinda Weak,"Two things I don't really like about this one:- It's kind of weak - or more accurately, doesn't vibrate as strongly where it ought to.- It's really hard plastic. It's more than just firm, it's stiff and ""hard"" (and not in the good way) and takes exactly the right mood to make it worth using.It's loud, too, but I expected that, was prepared for it, and don't use it when I am in a situation that calls for quiet."
4,love it!,"I actually really love this vibrator! It makes you get all the enjoyment you can!. The only complaint i had is that sometimes it was a bit hard to clean specially the stimulation part, they have these little wisker like ends that you have to be careful and make sure is clean. It's a great toy though and has lasted a long time!"
4,pretty good!,"This is pretty good! I have to say that it's louder than other reviewers had me believe, at least the twisting part. The virbrator isn't that loud so long as its pressed into you, but when it's away from anything to muffle it you can definitely hear it through the thin walls of my house. When I first got it, I thought it was a bit small and the first time i used it wasn't that great. Then I tried moving it in different places, and wow it is definitely worth the money! I gave four stars because it wasn't as quiet as I'd hoped."
4,It pleases but could have been better,i love the vibe rabbit part but the shaft is smaller than i thought and it drains batteries like no tomorrow. And it is very loud if you use the shaft part but the rabbit by its self is pretty quite and it does get the job done. But i would recommend this to beginners definitly but if you like bigger toys then this is soooo not the right choice.
1,Very disappointing,"I received this last Tuesday, and by Thursday it was broken, after only using it twice.... I had high expectations for this product seeing as it goes for around 50 dollars on other websites, so I thought 10 dollars was a steal. But when I opened the battery compartment there was a oil-like substance on the inside,which alarmed me from the start, but it worked well in the beginning, I used brand new batteries, so I know that wasn't the problem. The vibrations were also not nearly as powerful as I like. my toothbrush puts off more vibration."
2,Disappointed,Underpowered and not very well designed. It keeps stopping and you have to fumble with the buttons. Also has a very strong plastic smell. Would not recommend.
3,broken...,I was excited about this product however when it arrived it didn't work:( Amazon is replacing it and I'm hoping to get to try it out soon. Not so happy with it thus far though.
5,Johnstone,right up there with all of william Johnstones books. For just the pleasure of reading and entertainment I don't think you should overlook any book by him
2,Law of The Mountain Man (Mountain Man 5),Very simple language for the adult's conversation. A lot of comments that would never have been used in the setting of the story--Misspelling often --I did not finish the book because of it's errors and simple text.
5,Law of the Mountain Man (Mountain Man 5),"Great book and great story with a great action sequence. Characters are well thought out and sequence of events is riveting.Hey, I am writing a few year's of reviews. This stuff is tedious, so give me a break."
5,Another awesome book!,"Any western book written by Johnstone that has Smoke Jensen, Falcon McCallister, Jamie Ian McCallister, Matt Jensen or any of the other western hero's never lacks action!"
2,Unrealistic ending,"The worst part about this book other than the insane family is the unrealistic ending. When a person commits a crime, no matter how severe, they still end up going to jail in handcuffs. A girl can say that she doesn't want her boyfriend to be handcuffed and it doesn't make a difference to the cop that is arresting the person. In the book, after Emma almost kills Anne and breaks two of Anne's fingers, Emma's brother Mark requests that the policeman not handcuff Emma on the way to jail. The policeman surprisingly agrees and takes her to jail in the back of the police car without handcuffing her. This obviously wouldn't happen because Emma is insane. Overall, I did like Anne and she was very considerate of Madeline's feelings towards Mark."
1,Not Salsa---Lisa Dances Mambo,If any of you really dance Salsa which is danced on the first count (Known as dancing on the ones) then you will be confused by this video. Lisa dances the Mambo which is danced on the second count (Known as dancinig on the twos). So you have been warned that this exercise video is misleading and will confuse people who dance Salsa.
2,Red Hot Salsa II,This workout video was very hard to follow and it did not get my heart rate up to where it needs to be to burn enough calories. I guess it is a fun workout to do every once in awhile.
3,Much harder than I thought!,"Tough to keep up with!!! Complex footwork, and I'm latin!!! To be fair, I've never done any dance classes, so have no experience in learning coreographed steps (do know salsa, but this is really fast!). I do prefer more kickboxing style or straight traditional aerobics, cant beat those for a good workout. But gotta say, this would be a great workout if you can keep up!!!"
2,Nice try Dlink,"Can't beat the price of a wireless router/switch and print server all in one.However the product has some real ""inconvenient"" bugs:* I have never been able to make WEP work with my Lucent wireless card* The router needs to be rebooted in average once a day, suddenly the wireless network stops working and even the wireless button on the admin interface seems to be gone* The router won't sync by itself with the time server, needs to be done manually with every reboot.If you don't need the extra speed, I would recommend going for the 713p. It has been at least 3 months since the last time I had to reset that one."
1,I will never buy another D-Link Product,"The DI-714P+ I purchased was defective from day 1. However, it has now taken me 2 months to go through D-Link's technical support before they finally admited it, and I still have not been able to return it. Trying to get a hold of technical support has been a nightmare. Their email service is of no help, and their phone system habitually disconnects you or does not ""understand"" your selections. Other times the phone is busy, or the line is dead, or you get dumped into a voicemail box of someone that never calls you. Their technical support is by far the worst I have ever encoutered.If you need a router with a printer port, I strongly recommend the Netgear FM114P. It is a little more expensive, but it also includes a hardware firewall, and a real technical service department. The time I wasted on the D-Link was worth far more than the price difference."
3,Good but VERY OLD technology,Working good and Easy to Setup. Read carefully before buying. It is wi-fi B and the print server has only one Paralel port.If you are looking for wireless G or USB print server this unit is not for you
5,Awesome router - and the print server DOES work with Macs...,Just to correct/clarify the below reviewer's statement: The DI-714P+ (as wil *all* of D-Link's print server products) works fine with a Macintosh so long as you are attaching a PostScript printer. They are pretty clear about this in their documentation. An added bonus is that it does not require the addition of any other software - unlike Windows!Drew
2,I'd look for other products before choosing,"I had the SS2624 Siemens SpeedStream router and before it broke down, it worked really well. It has almost the same features as this D-Link but it's much cheaper.At the beginning i had little normal problems with it, but now, just sometimes and randomly (like right now), i get low speed problems or disconnected when wireless working.One wierd thing happens, my computers sometimes gets IP address from the router's DHCP, but cant get internet nor intranet access, and i dont think its the Wireless USB Adaptor's fault. (ATTENTION!! I've found out why this happens) The router comes with Firware 1.22 but once upgraded to 1.23 the router gets flawfull when working wirelessly and there is no way to downgrade it.I've also noticed that the amber LED from my cable modem is turned on most of the time and more than before with the other router, even when there is no computer turned on.Look around in forums to see this is no joke!"
4,Content vs. Platform,"It's about traditional media vs. new media. It's about the demise of newspapers. Most of all, this is a look at the way journalism is capable of working. I really didn't hear a lot ""complaining"" about new media. There was a lamination by people who care about their job and what they do under attack by a culture not interested in learning about the world.I really enjoyed Page One. This is the first time I had the chance to watch editors pick apart stories as they happen; this was the first chance I had to actually watch a reporter fact check a story for balance and accuracy. It explores numerous questions, and doesn't pretend to have a single definitive answer.What is the visual of the end of the war, when there is no end of the war?(Concerning the troop width-drawl from Iraq)What does a community loose when a local newspaper closes?There is a lot going on in this, and I'll watch it a few more times."
4,A peek behind the scenes,I am not a big fan of the New York Times and wanted to take a look at what makes it tick. This story did provide background and it's easy to see only people with certain politics are hired by them.
5,These War of 1812 Naval Novels are great!,"I had been reading almost all of Patrick O'Brian's and Alexander Kent's historical naval novels, which are written from the English Navy's perspective. It was such a treat to discover William White's War of 1812 Trilogy, which is from the early American Navy's perspective. I am not a very critical reader ... having tried my hand at a few novels, I know how difficult the process is. I just enjoy the stories and allow myself to get caught up in the adventure. William White's 1812 Trilogy is a great adventure. I really liked each of these books!Prentice Kinser III, D.Min. Author of:Limitless Living, A Guide to Unconventional Spiritual Exploration and Growth"
4,Great sandal,"I did not have any problems with fit on the sandal. I love the flare naughty monkey gives to a sandal. I wear these instead of the $5 flip flops from target because it is just as comfortable but way cuter. The only downfall was that the heel is a kitten heel which I am not used to so I wobble a little when I walk. Normally, I either wear flats or high 3"" heels and this is my first pair of kitten heels, so the fault is probably with me and my inexperience with the height rather than a defect or problem with workmanship/design. Overall, very cute sandal for a very great price!"
3,OK,"Good to use with older babies. Doesn't work well for breast feeding. Will use for tummy time when that time comes. Keep papers that come with it, shows pictures of how to use."
1,Flimsy,"Believe the other reviews on the internet. The larger the TV, the more flimsy this becomes. The platform is too light weight for the size & weight of larger heavier TV...even the ones the product information claims it will handle."
4,home maker,this was nice to put up in my moms' kitchen and get the tv off the counter top although i purchased additional straps for my own peace of mind to double secure tv to mounting brackets as she has many grandchildren running around
5,Works like a charm!,The bracket was just as advertized and works well. Not only that but I had forgotten to change my delivery address after the order was sent so I emailed the company directly and they made the correction for me so there was no delay in delivery.
2,not believable,"I read a lot of true crime books and did not find a lot of this book to be believable at all. First of all a psych hospital would of never just admit Cindy when just showing up at the hospital like she did!! I also do not believe the treatment that she was goiven while at the hospital,since I did work for 13 years at a psych facility and never once heard of or witnessed anything like this.Also AI do not believe her father would of admitted to his guilt the way she said it happened.I do believe that her father murdered her mother which is very tragic. I just feel that a lot of the story is not truth and only Cindys version. Which you can tell by the reading of the book that she is not very believable. THe authors did do a good job, but should of verified more of the TRUE facts of the story by other."
1,Such Bad Writing,"The actual murder case seemed interesting, but I just couldn't get very far in this book because the writing was SO BAD! There were endless amounts of dialogue that were just in no way shape or form how actual people speak. It jars you right out of the story when the people in the novel spout stupid nonsense that rings amazingly false. I would like to read about this case in a book written by someone else, someone that leaves out all the useless and stupid yet copious amounts of dialogue."
5,easy to follow,I was so amazed at the ease in which I was able to follow Sylvia's guidence. After reading several of her books I know I will never look at things the same way again. This book started me on my spiritual journey and I will always be thankful to Sylvia for that. It also provided me my first meditation with amazing results.
1,Just like the rest of her books,"I am very disapointed in this book. Basically it is a review of stuff she already talks about or goes over in Life on the other side. I read the whole book in under half an hour and the whole time I kept saying to myself "" I already read this in her other book"". I didn't play the cd, don't think I even care to at this point. I think she should just sell last chapter in this book with the cd, because all other chapters are review."
3,Contacting your spirit guide by Sylvia Browne,I found this book to be most informative and enlightening! It was an easy-read and actually fun to go through.
3,Its ok ...,"I enjoyed this book but it wasnt what I was hoping fromWhen I bought this book I wanted more things on guides itself, in general, how to find yours, but this book as little about that and more about Sylvia's own personal guide, which was very interesting but not what I was looking forI think Sylvia's gift are quite real but some of this book seems a bit far fetch even for me to believe, but the thoughts are nice to have if the afterlife is like this"
3,spirit guide,It is a good book. But it was missing alittle more information. It does not tell youhow to contact your spirit guide it tells you how Sylvia contacts her guide
3,"Quick read, not the instructional book I expected","This book was a super quick read. There was a lot of background on Sylvia's guides, how they exist, and how they help her. I didn't see as much on how one can actually contact their own guides --- it was a lot of just close your eyes, trust yourself and you'll know. I also expected more explanation on the different types of guides (angels, human, animal) and to be able to understand that topic.I did find the CD from one of her lectures helpful. However, the CD (except for the meditation) is repeated as a chapter in the book. The thing that resonated the most was her discussion about validations and that you don't need to have an image in front of you or hear words loud and clear to have a conversation with your guide. Other than that, it was interesting to hear about her guide, but I'm no closer to understanding or contacting my guide."
4,Interesting,"This book explores the topic of spirit guides and how they relate to your everyday life. The CD included is good, but because of Sylvia's ""raspy"" voice, it is not condusive to true relaxation during the excercise on the cd."
1,Cannot contact spirit guides,"I was not satisfied with the book at all. There is little or nothing in the text about how to contact your spirit guide, except fora verbatim transcript of the included CD. The book is all about Sylvia and her relationship with her spirit guide. I do not recommmend this book to anyone serious about anythine metaphysical."
2,READ ME!!!,"I thought this book would be better.. It was very short, the type setting was VERY large. Each chapter was probaly about 1 pages worth for writting.. And the last chapter was a read along with the CD. The only thing I would say that was good about this book was the CD that came along with it."
1,way to go sylvia shoemaker browne!!!!,this book is just from the imagination of sylvia shoemaker browne; she was convicted in 1992 for investment fraud... why would anybody take advice from somebody who was convicted for LYING ??
1,NEVER GOT IT!!!,I was EXTREMELY upset with this purchase! I never received the product and event after pestering continuously I never got a refund or my book! wft?....Don't buy from this seller!
1,Total baloney,"This book is total fiction masquerading as fact. Even though I live in San Francisco, this book is too nutty for anyone I know."
5,What?,"Deuteronomy:Deu 19:10 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.Deu 19:11 But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities:Deu 19:12 Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.Where are ""guides and demons"" mentioned in this?"
5,I love this Book!,This is a fabulous book and Sylvia Browne is one of my favorite ladies of all time. I have read every single one of her books. I love the fact that this book came with the CD. I haven't listed to the CD yet but I plan on doing it soon.Love and Light
5,It as if I already knew,This book was like reading information that my soul already knew...I can't wait to read more...I feel so complete! Thank you...
5,Geeze Louise,You guys sure like to make me type all these reviews alot I love Sylvia Browne and she brings alot into my life and helps me with my own personal brand and belief of spirituality.
1,So misleading,I think the idea of being guided by a spirit with your wellness in mind is very appealing. This book should be filed in children's fiction. There are so many protests at this woman's events I am surprised she is still able to convince people that she has a meaningful connection to the spirit world. Especially with all the footage of her bombing on youtube.
5,Sylvia keeps turning out good work,"I have read all of Sylvia's works, she does not let up or cut corners. This is truly an entertaining author, but if truth could be understood as reality in application of her teachings that would be the benefit of this book. After reading this and making the step to contact, I have no doubts there are in fact guides. This is one of the most enlightening books I've had the pleasure to really get into and study as well. Be prepared to make a huge step if you decide to follow through with Sylvia's instructions. I strongly suggest reading Karl Maddox to further understand how to contact your ""Guardian"" and guide."
4,Francine's story,"I admire Sylvia Browne. Reading her books and seeing her work helps the learning process. This book about contacting your spirit guide is more Sylvia's story about Francine, one of Sylvia's spirit guides. Very interesting, but not as personally informative as I'd have liked.Everyone has a spirit guide - this book doesn't hook you up."
1,Don't waste your time or dollars unless you have lots of spare CF cards,"I bought a NEX IA when they first came out and it was barely worth it then and is basically a paperweight now. I thought I would/could upgrade to a microdrive larger than 1 GB but no go. The largest CF card or drive I can get to work in the player is 1 GB. The player uses 2 AA batteries and is large and heavy compared to any other player on the market. The only possible good use for this paperweight is in your car, and then if you have a stack of spare CF cards loaded with music and labeled. You can buy a 12volt lighter plug in adapter to power the unit and I happen to have a cassette player that I can plug a headphone to cassette adapter into. I am trying to make it last as a car player, otherwise, I'd toss it in the garbage."
1,Crashed after a couple times.,"I never really wrote reviews before, but I should start writing more and warning people about bad products. I was looking for a cheap alternative to those Ipods, and I thought this would be it. I was unimpressed with the casing and the buttons, but I was ok with it because it was so inexpensive. But I found out the MP3s wouldn't play back correctly, then occasionally I see an hourglass on the screen which meant that it crashed. I had to remove the batteries to clear it up. A couple reviews mentioned the exact same problem. Don't be misled by the 5 stars one that say it's excellent and perfect. Please read ALL the reviews and then judge. I'm just being honest and want to save people the hassle. I returned it and got my money back."
3,Don't buy if you want to support Ogg Vorbis files,"I bought one of these for my wife so that she could listen to some of our CDs at the gym without having to carry a dozen CDs. Since their web site claims Ogg Vorbis support through a firmware upgrade, I figured that was included in 1.1. However, contacting their tech support reveals that Ogg Vorbis support has been in development for over a year, and is not ready to be released and there is no estimated release date.Lesson learned, spend the extra $100 and get the iRiver iGP-100 which comes with 4x the storage capacity and supports Ogg out of the box.As an mp3/wmv player, it is quite nice -- even though the application included expires after 30 days and costs another $29.95, but, you can access the unit directly and just copy files over. The radio tuner works fairly well in my area, although I doubt I am 15 miles from the station antennas."
3,customer care for this item sucks,"the player is working fine only if u upgrade the firmware. but in my package, there is a missing ac/dc adaptor and the remote is not working at all. and for replacing the remote, i hav to ship it all the way to hong kong which will cost me extra bucks unnecessarily. there is no direct contact number for the customer care in US and the email support is not good. i wanted to return the item initially but i am impressed by the quality of the mp3 player at this cheap cost. i got so much irratated by the customer care of the manufacturer because of which i am giving only 3 points. so if u get ur player and accessories correctly in ur initial package, its very good. otherwise the customer care really really sucks.update:- the player is working really good except for the battery indicator. the player stops functioning even when the battery indicator shows that half battery is still remaining. voice recorder is also very good."
1,Returned mine,"My unit that quit working after 2 days. Started to skip, lose sound, and stall completely after I downloaded more than 100Mb. Also didn't quite care for the product for the following reasons:1. Cheap plastic casing with a track button that wasn't quite centered.2. Cheap headset.3. Software was ok but kept prompting me to upgrade ($$).Returned for a refund (hopefully)! Maybe it was just my luck, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it."
1,Poor Quality,Received the player with great expectations only to find it virtually unusable because of the extremely poor fit of the headset plug in the player's jack. The plug wobbles around and loses contact so that the only way to listen to the player is to hold the plug in by hand. Still with any movement it loses contact. Frustrating for an expensive player. Am in the process of contacting Frontier Labs for repair or replacement. Will update the review later with their response.
2,Nice player. Non-existent support.,"This is a pretty nice MP3 player, unless you need service. The FM reception is awful, but I knew that from reading other reviews before I bought mine. The MP3 player is quite nice. It sounds good, is easy to connect to the computer, and takes Compact Flash, which is rare in an MP3 player.Then the CF card that came with it went bad. I've sent email and left voice-mail at least 8 times over the last month, and I haven't heard a word in response. I consider myself lucky that it's just the CF card, since I can replace that quite easily myself (which I've done). If the player itself were to break during the warranty period, I'd be completely out of luck.I'll buy from a company that stands behind their products next time."
1,What the He$%,"I am a man of few words on this item...It doesnt seem to work!!! Only thing working is the mp3, Radio doesnt pick up stations, the built in recorder recordings sounds like it's recorded under water ... it is ill made, the MP3 sound is very good to say the least... I would not buy another product by FrontierLabs again...EVER!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Not bad, but could be better","The Nex IA player is really simple to operate. The drag-n-drop method for transferring songs/files is really neat. The remote control on the headphones is very nice. However, the radio reciption is not clear.The design could be improved by adding a clip or arm band strap to the case. The current case has a belt loop and none of my running outfits have belts. Next the door that covers the CF card keeps popping open - probably from poor manufacturing."
2,A disappointment,I bought the NEX ia over other models because of the FM receiver. That was a bad decision because living just 20 miles out of central Houston I can't get but maybe one obsure station. Battery life is nothing like claimed. I get about 4-5 hours before it starts freezing up and skipping. My remote quit working after about a week. The download is agonizingly slow. There is no cover over the computer connect port unless you use the cover which I do for running to help protect from moisture (sweat).On the positive the sound quality is good but you will need new headphones and it is stable while running.
1,NEX ia vs Rio S10,"I received the NEX ia from Amazon. It was hard to get a connection with the PC. Usually took about 3 tries. It did not like re-chargeable batteries. The Joy stick started sticking. There was no service number to call in the U.S., only an e-mail address that returned answers after one day with simple minded questions to a question that got me nowhere. The manual was very poor. I sent it back. The user interface of the unit was fine except for not being able to monitor NIMH battery levels. Their support by email only was unacceptable."
1,BEWARE !,"I would rate Frontier Labs with a big zero if it were an option, otherwise they get a 1. The MP3 player we bought was a piece of junk. Crashed repeatedly and locked up regularly. Customer service was terrible and no help whatsoever. We ended up with a pricey paper weight; and would never buy anything from Frontier Labs again !!!!!!!!! Make sure you shop around before buying."
1,FM RADIO DOES NOT WORK IN NEX 1A,"Why nobody even mention about this. Looks like review done by manufacturer.I tryied 3 units the same problem FM can receive 1 radio station in San Francisco area. My 5$ digital walkman can receive 25 stations in perfect quality.So, FM recording feature is useless, because there is noise only."
1,Drivers CD given with this sucks,"i bought this player last week , today i received it , but when i tried to install the drivers on my laptop they doesn't install and there is no way of loading songs in this mp3playercan anybody help me with thisi liked the piece but wht the use when i am not able to load songs into it thought my laptop . my laptop has wondows XPso plz help me"
3,"Rent, Don't Buy","This is a film you will watch only once. It proves that the French will laugh at anything.Within the first 10 minutes, you know the ending of this movie. As another reviewer said, it is very predictable.Basic Plot: Homely looking guy (the valet) wants to marry homely looking girl (book store owner), but she doesn't love him. He is more of a brother to her. Until -- she see's him dating a Super Model. Now she wants him. Talk about shallow. The Super Model is the mistress of a married billionaire, who has promised her that he will divorce his wife and marry her. The wife suspects he has a mistress, and to throw her off the scent, he has the Super Model date the valet -- actually live with him. This does not fool the wife. Etc, etc, etc. No surprises, no chuckles, only yawns.The script has way too many holes in it, even for a French ""farce"". Three stars for the French scenery."
2,Not recommended for the middle school classroom,"From the perspective of a middle school ELA teacher, I thought this compilation was a tad dated, being that the author emphasizes a pro-Panther attitude that hearkens back to the publishing date (1973). I was hoping for something interesting and edgy I could use in my 80%+ African-American school. Not quite what I was hoping for...there isn't much here in terms of literary terms or poetic techniques I could highlight and the writing was quite stale."
3,Almost as advertised.,"The picture shows a 600mAH battery. You have to look closely. The battery that arrived was only 500mAH. However, this is still greater than the 400mAH rating of the original iPod mini battery. Installation was quick and easy using the provided tools. You do have to be comfortable with jewelers size screwdrivers. Still, even if you lose some of the tiny screws, or the clamp, you could probably still close the mini up and glue it in place."
2,FRAGILE,Its not made by a hard metal. Its very thin and its resistance is not good.It wouls be heavy and strong
5,Love it,"I was terrified to startn this program as it is a huge commitment, but I am half way through it and loving the journey it is taking me on. I am so pleased with my physical results, and my low back pain is gone for the first Time in three years. Travis is a great teacher with a wonderful style. The content of the workouts fits together well. They are challenging but once you start moving they are over before you know it.I am not saying this is an easy program that is suited for everybody. If you have the drive to make the commitment you will see results.I feel very fortunate to have found this practice. I highly recommend it!"
5,This is a Great Teacher,"For years I have been frustrated by Yoga teachers. There are no classes available here. Trying to learn the moves was just too difficult. This teacher moves at a pace that you can appreciate. The videoes are filmed beautifully...the intro about Travis I thought was a little too Hollywood. But I totally appreciate the manner inwhich he instructs and the pacing. He has really taken out the intimidation of trying to keep up. I love his voice; I am 59. I hope you give these your attention. They are pricey but totally worth it. Thank you!**Since I am older& not a yoga student I also purchased ""Foundations"" I am working on this learning the moves before I get into the 108 day challenge. But I plan on Travis Eliot DVD's being a part of my life and health. I recommend Foundations also."
1,Better to read machiavelli,"This is book goes about the subject of being a successful student the wrong way. If you want to be a master student you should read machiavelli and not waste your time or money with this book or any other silly study guide. Try ""A Child's machiavelli"""
5,CD Soundtrack of All the Pretty Horses,The quality of the CD was excellent both to the naked eye and the sound that came from it. It arrived within the time frame promised.
5,Beautiful,"Like the Sling Blade soundtrack, this one has gems and not-so-gems. But when it shines, it REALLY is moving. Yes, the songs are short (damn), but this is money well spent. If you don't break down during song 13 you have no heart. A super soundtrack. Buy it."
4,I love this carrier!,"I have a bad back and it's difficult to lift my cat in a carrier. I love this one because I can wheel it! The only down side is that the handle is a little short for me. I am 5.7"" But I still use it all the time!"
3,It's okay.,"Definitely a chick flick, this thing isn't geared for the single male. I knew that when I made the purchase, but was hoping for more than a movie of the week production. The story lacks some credibility, even for a rom-com, and other than the camera work (standard and uninspired) that's its only real fault.A few more dollars could've really livened up this production and not only made it credible in terms of the major plot point around which the story revolves, but it might have also ratcheted up the comedy by a few degrees. As it is now it's just a simple film that has a girlish/feminine appeal of the out of luck single in search of her knight in shining armor, even if she has to violate the Mann Act.Not a very bright production, but it is an ABC TV film. Take it for what it is."
2,Not what I expected,Thought this was going to be a good wholesome movie. If you have values than you might not want to get this. Was very disappointed in it.
4,Cute for chicks,"A cute movie, even though the plot was not believable. A ""chick flick"" that most guys could tolerate."
1,Horrible Movie!,"I saw this movie on the ABC Family channel last year....love their play of all holiday movies during Christmas-time. My sister and husband watched it with me, and we completely rolled our eyes and made fun of the entire thing. Plot is ridiculous, and makes you want to beat your head against the wall. I've always been a fan of both Melissa and Mario, but the acting in this story was just horrendous. The only reason we finished is because my sister insisted. We all thought it would get better. It didn't. I'd rate it a zero if possible! Complete waste of your holiday movie watching time!"
4,Holding Christmas Hostage for Laughs,"Another cute Christmas film meant for laughs and pure enjoyment. Ordered this one fairly late in the season and received it in plenty of time for holiday viewing. Thank you to the Amazon vendor who sent it via airmail reindeer for me. This is another tv movie that shows up each year during December on cable. I was anxious to have a copy for myself since I plan to watch it periodically all year long - not just during the holidays. Well cast, humorous, predictable but truly enjoyable plot! Worth a look if you have a chance to catch it."
5,Romantic Holiday Fun,"I love this movie from the first time and more everytime I watch it. I can relate to the situation, heart-felt compassion and comedy it brings to the viewers. Enjoy this throughout the holiday season to get that hot-chocolate feeling together!!!!!!"
1,Not a Keeper,"Too much sexual content and it is not what I would consider a ""Family Friendly"" Christmas movie. I wish I would have looked at the ""1"" star reviews, rather than the chosen critical review."
4,Pretty good for a made for TV.,One of my favorite TV Christmas movies. Melissa is funny in it. I just had to buy it and add it to my Christmas movie collection.
5,Holiday in Handcuffs,"Holiday in HandcuffsThis movie is surprisingly well done. We were expecting the usual cookie cutter Christmas ""B"" movie, but were surprised to find a rather unique story line. Not bad acting either considering we had never heard of any of the cast members. If you are a fan of romantic Christmas comedies, this is one you will want to add to your collection."
5,Fantastic movie,Very intertaining movie. Loved it from beginning to end. I have a seven year old granddaughter who is still watching it everyday after school. She loves it too. It's just a great little holiday movie.
5,Excelent!,Thanks! Everithing is alright. The service was excelent. The movie arrives in very very good conditions. Thanks for everithing!!! Success
4,An unbelievable but fun story.,"How does one find a fiance when one doesn't have one in time to spend Christmas with family at a cabin in the mountains? Simple answer, handcuff someone and convince them to go along with your implausible scheme. Okay, I get it, it isn't rocket science, but it is a charming movie starring Melissa Joan Hart and Mario Lopez. Some may call it mindless entertainment, but in my opinion, it is a Christmas movie for the entire family. It is wholesome fun and a real feel good story. One small caveat, there is some sexual content and it may not be for everyone, but most people, I believe, will enjoy this fun movie."
5,Holiday in Handcuffs,"First saw this movie on TV. When I saw it on DVD had to have it! Funny,funny,funny with a twist of romance. Up beat movie fun for the whole family.Pop some popcorn add it to your Christmas collection."
3,Why it is not a good idea.,"I'm wasn't a too big a fan of the Sabrina - Teenage Witch"" Tv-series. Maybe I was too old to fully appreciate it. Now that Melissa Joan Hart is grown-up and plays grown-up roles I can appreciate her more. ""Holiday In Handcuffs"" was shown on Swedish TV just a few days before christmas and it was just as good as I remember it to be. Ok,so kidnapping might not be the best way to start a relationship but what is a desperate girl to do when she's dumped by her boyfriend just before she's to embark on a trip to meet her folks. You don't need to be a brain surgeon to figure out the plot line but it's not the story that matters but the journey to get to the punch line that is the interesting. So if you like your movies sappy and teardrenched, look elsewhere because this is light-hearted and quite fun entertainment for most of the family.Anders EkdahlHoliday in Handcuffs"
4,Light hearted Christmas movie,"I bought this movie without knowing much about the story, it was really the fact I was looking for a new holiday season movie and the actors seemed appealing. Overall I enjoyed this movie, while it was a little slow to start up and the story seemed a little disjointed at times, I still got into it. It did sort of end a bit briefly which was disappointing but it is a chickflick so you know from early on how it will end. Overall a good movie, likeable characters, a story that many people could relate to as far as judging parents are concerned and a bit of romance thrown in for good luck...I would watch it again!"
4,quirky holiday title,funny predictable little abc movie of the week for the holidays but I really like melissa joan hart ..... as annoying as she may be
5,Holiday viewing,"I saw this movie on Netflix, in fact I watched it three times. That's when I decided to buy it. This is the funniest holiday movie I have ever seen. It even beats out National Lampoon."
1,Not for the WHOLE family,"I was really excited to get this for Christmas. I normally love ABC Family movies. I was really disappointed in how many sexual references and innuendos were made in this movie. This was not a movie for the whole family. I would not want my kids watching it, and don't even want to see it again myself."
1,"Rude, crude, and badly scripted","The holiday season should be about gratitude - I was grateful when it was over. This movie did not have a redeeming quality. If there was a way to give no stars, I would have chosen that one. I'm a fan of the holiday season and this did nothing but annoy me. I thought the idea had potential for romantic comedy, but they blew it on both levels. What's the fun of watching people argue, make bad choices for which there is no believable consequence, and have a stressed-out Christmas? I wouldn't let my kids watch this and I broke the DVD into pieces before I put it in the garbage."
1,Good up to the end - ABC blew it,"We watched this on TV last year. It was a good ""Christmas"" special up to the last third of the movie. ABC had to throw in a side story line of Melissa Joan Hart's character's brother being homosexual. If you don't have a problem with that choice of lifestyle, you will probably enjoy this movie. If you disagree with it (as my family does), you will most likely want to skip this movie. It didn't even add anything to the story and was, in my opinion, pointless to put in the movie.If you are looking for a good Christmas special from ABC Family, I would recommend Snowglobe from that same time period. It was a cute, corny and funny special that I would consider mostly family friendly. I am not adding Holiday in Handcuffs to my Christmas movie collection."
3,Roll the dice,"This card has worked flawlessly on at least two of my friends' computers, a top-of-the-line ThinkPad and a Dell Inspiron 4000. Alas, it's a different story on mine.I have an HP omnibook 500, and when I first plugged this thing in, the machine instantly turned off, as if I had reset it. I think it screwed up my COM2 port, too. Now, when I want to use it, I have to shut down to put it in, then reset my machine, turn it on, and pray. It usually turns off abruptly during the Windows XP logo screen at least once, and I have to reset everything and do it again. Once I get everything up and running, it works really well, but it is a real pain to get to that point.Again, on other systems it seems to work really well, but you may not have such good luck."
1,does not work on old BIOS,Try to install it on my Compaq EVO N600c laptop running Win 2000 professional and keep crashing. Called Tech Support wait for 30 minutes and was told BIOS need to update BIOS before it will work. Ask what BIOS and version it will support and was told that thet did not know and I should contact Compaq. Updated BIOS from Compaq and still does not work. Returned product and will not deal with DLINK again.
3,Just fine with one problem...,"Amazon is linking me here, though my invoice lists Fox Martin Corp as the vendor. The flag is just what I was looking for. Unfortunately, there is a three-inch mark where the red was overdyed or misprinted. It's not worth the hassle to return. I haven't hung it yet, but the grommets seem to be well-finished."
2,Bah Hummer!,"We received this as a gift but had it returned as we could not set the alarm. Also found the lighting to be too dim and the lettering-a.m., p.m., etc.-to be so small you almost needed a magnifying glass to read it."
2,"Good features, shame about the quality",The multi country feature of this atomic controlled clock was my attraction for buying it as I travel to the UK. Unfortunately the alarm on the clock failed - it was impossible to set it.I returned it to Amazon for a refund as Amazon had no more in stock.
4,Answers Life Tough Questions,"Although I am not a christian and don't believe some of the fundamental tenets of the religion I have to applaud Rick Warren for his works on this book. He assures the reader that there is always a solution to even the most challenging problem in life and God is always there to help. I am going to try to be more open minded after reading this book, although I still stand by my harsh negative reviews on the more legalistic christian books such as Mary Baxter's ""A Divine Revelvation of Hell"" and Bill Weise's ""23 Minutes in Hell"".Rick Warren is a whole lot different in his writing than those other two grossly fundamentalist writers I just mentioned. In closing I would recommend this book to anyone who is struggling through life difficulties."
5,A real labor of love,"A true labor of love by writer/director, cast and crew. We did our best to make something very unique and special."
1,War Machine,High school kids make better films!!!! $0.10 is too much for this title! To say it is a ripoff is to be too kind!! To give this film even one star is to insult all other one star films!
1,A waste of time and money,"I rented this movie based on its single review. What a mistake! The photography looks like it was done using 8 or 16mm film. The action is jerky is places, the color badly balanced and the focus is not very sharp. The dialogue is stilted and the main actor sounds like a young Arnold Schwarzenegger. I don't know if that is intentional or not.This movie was a waste of an hour and a half of my time. Not recommended."
3,' Victory Over Vice' by Fulton Sheen,"An interesting read but somewhat dated.Having watched 'Life is Worth Living' on EWTN,I believe that the late Archbishop speaks better than he writes.However Sheen's views on vice are timeless and in an increasingly secular world it is a message worth learning.If the reader is prepared to look beyond the dry archaic language then they could gain much from this book."
5,2 Below Zero presents Confessions of a Hustler,"This CD is the best thing to happen to Hip Hop music in a long time. I got this CD on repeat in my car. 2 Below Zero are going to be Ledgends. And to top the CD off, the Movie comes free with the CD."
3,No Pockets,"This book has plenty of room for information, in fact, too much. It's also difficult to glue things to the pages, as the book would get too thick over time. It didn't have pockets to store report cards, photos, etc., unless you cut them out and glue them to the pages. It was frustrating!"
4,Great except for pockets,"Overall this is a great book!! It has several pages each for preschool through 12th grade with categories such as 1st day of school clothes for preschool, teachers and classmates, fieldtrips, and favorites (songs, tv shows, etc.). There are also pages for each birthday and home life (family vacations and room for parents to record ""thougts about my child this year""). There are even pages for high school graduation, medical and dental records, and a family tree. The book is colorful and hardback so it'll hold up - I plan to give them to my sons as graduation presents!! The ONLY drawback is the keepsake pockets. You have to cut them out of the back of the book and glue them on designated pages. In addition, they are fairly small (1/2 a page) and therefore won't hold much. I love the book so much though that I'll just buy a separate folder for such items and cherish the level of detail I can record in the actual book!!"
5,SCHOOL DAYS,"If you're interested in a book to pick up where a baby book left off, this is it! There are several pages for each grade level, beginning with preschool and going through 12th grade. There are pockets for keepsakes and spaces for pictures and lots of places to write in highlights of each school year. This book is very colorful. I am so happy with the 3 books I bought and I'm sure that as my children go through their school years, they will be adding treasures to the books to make them true keepsakes."
2,too much writing; not enough momentos,"This book is great if you are a writer and plan to record every detail of your childs school career, including, birthdays, fieldtrips, fave songs, shows, colors, stuffed animals, foods, games, homelife, vacations, and the list could go on forever! But it is literally impossible to include any keepsakes. There is a place where picts are suppossed to be glued to the thin paper but very many would make the book impossible to close. Also the 1/2 page, cut out folders are weak!! Practically writing is the only thing that will fit in this book. Mine will be in my next yard sale!"
1,School Days Book,I was very disappointed with this book. It had no pockets and the book came written and scribbled in and I was not able to use it. This is the last time I buy from Amazon!!
3,Not as hoped,"This works somewhat, but it is not long enough and it slides around quite a bit. It's just not a snug fit."
2,Kinda dull,"I was looking forward to this book, but was disappointed by the projects. This book seems to me to be better suited for kids than adults. I think that even a beginning crafter would not find this book very informative. The projects are ones that you could be inspired to build just by looking at supplies in a craft store. I think that it would be better for kids because they are more likely to need really simple instructions for basic techniques. A better book that has basic techniques more suited for adults is -The Encyclopedia of Papermaking and Bookbinding- by Reimer-Ep and Reimer."
5,A Perfect Solution,"I bought two of these for my four kids. It was the perfect solution to a clutter problem. They were fairly easy to assemble, and they are just the right size for the kids to hang their coats, store their bookbags, hats, gloves, etc. They work out great in our laundry room where we can store items on the top, out of reach of the kids. Wish I discovered these babies years ago."
1,Nursery Nurse Speaks Out,"As a Intensive Care Nursery Nurse, as well as the parent of a former premature baby, Helen Harrison's book is extremely outdated. It was a bible when it was first published in 1983, but the field of neonatal medicine is constantly changing and any book written over 5 years ago is probably outdated, not to mention 20 years ago. My hat is off to Helen Harrison for her pioneering the field of premature parenting,but there are many other more recent books which will be far more useful to premature parents than this one. Linda Cole RN"
2,Good info if your baby was born 20 years ago!,"This USED to be the bible of premie books. Twenty plus years later we have made tremendous strides in saving babies. Even 15 years ago I found many of the scenarios to be too depressing and no longer realistic. I do hope the author will come out with an update since so many people are directed to this book. In the meantime, I highly recommend (and use often when helping parents understand the crisis of their babies premature birth)Newborn Intensive Care: what every parent needs to know by Jeanette Zaichkin and published by NICU Ink. In 1983 we were just beginning to involve parents in their babies care and seeing them as an integral part of ""the team"". This newer book (1996) focuses on those things that parents can do to maximize their babies outcomes. Don't distress yourself over medical problems that are more easily treated today.

3,"Great resource guide, needs updating",This book was a tremendous help when coping with the birth of both premature sons. It has very easy to understand definitions and provides wonderful life stories. My only discontent was that the book could be even better if they updated it. It really needs to include 90's and 00's technology. It is a little outdated.
1,this product did not last at all,"The screen that came with my razor lasted me years until it finally broke, so I purchased this one, and within ONE MONTH, it broke.I didn't have any problems(ex: dropped it or hit it on something), it just one day was broken.Very crappy product!Panasonic used to be the best, but I've noticed lately, since they've gone ""made in china"", that they really have quality issues now."
2,Panasonic Shaver foil and heads,on't get these.I have had this shaver for 4 years and had not replaced the shaver heads and foil for 2 years. The quality of the replacements was terrible. I ended up going back to the old shaver heads and foil because the new ones did not cut as close.I am going to just replace the whole shaver now.
3,A good FIRST computer game,"My daughter is 3 1/2 and loves Dora. But this game is WAY too simple for her. There just aren't enough things to do, and even the higher levels don't really challenge compared to her two other games: Care Bears and Blue's Clues. If you have a two-year-old or a child who's never played on a computer, this is great at teaching basic color, shape & number recognition and how to use a mouse & click. A better choice for a 3 - 4 year old is Blue's ABC Time Activities."
4,A good first game for a child,"My daughter is 2 1/2 and we're introducing her to the wonderful world of computers. She loves Dora (What little girl doesn't?), so this seemed like a great way to get her started. Although this game states that it is for children 3 and over, I think that this is a good game for younger children as long as you can help them out. This is basically a collection of very basic games which cover counting, shapes, colours, etc. If your child already has the skills to use a mouse and is well versed in shapes and such, then I agree with some other reviewers that this may be too simplistic, but for a younger child - especially one who loves Dora - this adds just a little bit more interactivity to the ""Dora experience"" and can help get him/her more comfortable with using a mouse."
1,UNHAPPY SISTER,My litlle sister was angrey becuse the program whould always lock up on are computer and say that are windowas was not right we have windows xp but she wasnt haveing that much fun with it anyway becuse thare were only 4 levels anyway and we some how got spyzapper after playing it dont buy it.
4,Terrific Book,"This is the first book of Ferre's that I read and I found it just fine. I agree with Publisher's Weekly that the introduction of a new voice near the end was jarring. But as someone not familiar with Puerto Rico of the early 20the Century I thought it was interesting, and the descriptions of the ballet company were engrossing. Great literature? No. A good read about two subjects exotic to most readers -- old Puerto Rico and ballet? Yes. I think it would make a great movie."
2,"Useful for info, but doesn't teach the game...","If you're really looking to learn how to play Smackdown SYM, then this guide isn't for you. I bought it hoping to find out the tricks to actually WINNING matches, and was sorely disappointed. It mentions nothing about effective ways to counter your opponent or score a pinfall. Frankly, it contradicts itself in several places in terms of what button to press to execute a move!On the positive side, if you want to just see a full list of moves for each wrestler, then this guide can be helpful. It also lists the different match types and what wins the match for you (pin fall, submit, put opponent through table, etc). Beyond that this really doesn't tell strategies at all."
4,Excellent images!,"I don't know much about architecture, but my girlfriend is an architect and LOVED it! I would recommend it to anyone who likes architecture."
4,Great for emergencies,"Great items to have with you when camping. You hope you won't need them, but good to know they are on hand."
2,Richard Pryor in a familiar yet different light,"I purchased the VHS (that's the only version available) and I saw the skit (?) Richard Pryor & Lily Tomlin were in. It wasn't particularly funny but it was insightful. It showed his range, both of their ranges, actually and I'm glad I saw it though I wish I could have just seen someone else's copy and saved my money because the rest of her special just plods along."
4,There's a few good remixes here,"Kathy's Song wasn't one of my favorite songs on Welcome To Earth, but a couple of the remixes on this single are actually an improvement over the original. The VNV Nation remix is a slow and haunting version, while a couple of others are faster club remixes of the original. Overall, it's a rather solid single."
3,Woohoo another remix disc,"Personally, I'm not a big fan of EP's like this. They seem more like a chance to get some friends together and mess around with the songs. (VNV's Burning Empires was an exception in my mind, they actually seemed to try to bring a different song to the table when they were done.) Anyways, from Apop, this is about what you'd expect. Nothing great, but not a horrible effort either. Though I would deffiniatly say make sure this isn't your first Apop purchase."
3,Stick with the album version unless you're a completist,"""Kathy's Song"" is in its best form on ""Welcome to Earth."" As is nearly ALWAYS the case with remixes, these alternate cuts don't improve upon the original. (Nine Inch Nails, anyone?) So, the album version (track 2) sounds even better than usual. Kathy programmed a great tune, and Stephen Groth's singing is Abba-smooth.All the same, it's good to have choices. VNV Nation's mix speeds up the tempo and adds some urgency to the song. Ferry Corsten's remix also has good hustle, and a nice beatless interlude for the ""Come lie next to me"" part. The ""C64"" version sounds like a late-80s Casio plugged into a 4-track recorder.""Kathy's Song"" is a deserving EBM hit, and this single is a logical buy for collectors. I'm just not so huge into the ""oonce-oonce"" treatment so prevalent in dance music right now."
4,I've missed this record,"I heard the 8-track of cookbook playing in a store when I was quite young. I didn't see a record so I bought the 8-track of this when I didn't even have an 8-track player.My brother had an 8-track player that I used when he wasn't home.I was still playing the 8-track of this in my car when I was going to college, but when the 8-track went by the way side, so did my copy of this music until today.So glad to have you back George! Sounding better and more clear than ever to me!I use sax, trombone and organ on many of my own recordings because of these early influences.http://www.soundclick.com/members/default.cfm?member=k9lb"
1,Worthless,"I had to stop reading this book after chapter 3. It is by far the worst book to study for this exam. The content doesn't truly reflect the exam at all. The coverage of IPSec is terrible. To sum it up, do not buy!"
1,Warning! Warning! Warning!,"This book is absolutely terrible! I truly and honestly cannot believe that someone was actually paid to write it. I cannot tell you how bad this book is. I mean, I would have given this book NO STARS if it were possible. The author writes as if he is writing his doctoral thesis in physiological psychology instead of a book for computer professionals preparing to take their Microsoft Exam 70-220: Windows 2000 Security Design. Even when you know what the author is talking about, you don't. Consider the following example of his drivel:""Just as the study of animal physiology provides a rationale for many peculiar behaviors, you better understand functional adaptations in a business workflow when you explore the limitations in the underlying structure that caused it.""Translation: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,A terrible read. I found it incredibly difficult to follow.,"<excerpt> ""..You might assume that because of the increase in use of the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) in software development and the emphasis on software interoperability across non-Microsoft ""cultures"" (e.g., Novell, Unix, and Machintosh), a major Widows 2000 theme is a scalable organizational structure.""What!?! While the contents of the book appears to be presented in a logical order, it reads like a list of unrelated thoughts. You may think this is an isolated example but it's not. That excerpt was from Chapter 2 - Security Overview. I assure you there is plenty more where that came from.I would definately not recommend this book, and it just reinforces my belief that since the NT 4 series, the quality of Coriolis books has seriously suffered. I'll stick with Sybex."
1,Horribly Written Book,"I agree with all previous reviews. This book is not what you come to expect for an ExamCram. The author may understand the concepts he is presenting, but presents it in such ""businessease"" that it is EXTREMELY difficult to follow. This was the biggest waste of money I have ever invested in a preparation guide! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! The authors writing is horrible!"
3,Too small,I wanted a rug just for a .38 special 2'. It fits but the zipper rubs on the gun being to small.
5,Nice product.,"This is a bit small but fits my sig nightmare p938 well, but not with an extended clip in it."
3,Barely fit,"The product is ok, but barely fits a Smith and Wesson model 649 357 magnum, although they say it does, you can barely zip it closed."
2,Not good at all,This is one of the worst ones Ive ever read.You find out the solution to the mystery of the haunted bridge in the beginning.The book had little meaning.It had some suspence but other than that it is a really bad book
2,2 1/2 stars,"This review concerns the 1972 version: Nancy is off for a visit to the Deer Moutain hotel to test her skills on the links. Soon she encounters the pretensious young golfer Martin Bartescue. An arrogant golf stroke leads her into the woods rather to find her ball, she discovers a brass jewel case. Knowing her father is on the lookout of a ring of jewel thieves, Nancy is soon underway upon another adventure. The revision of this book, considering it was written in the 70's, which is to most fans known to be the era in which the worst books were written, wasn't all that bad. Although the internal art work is just TERRIBLE as in most Nancy's around this time, the writing is average. Although the original is ten times superior to the revision, I'd still reccomend it..."
5,The haunted bridge,It was another great book just like all the other Nancy drew books i would suggest that you read them all in order just for fun.
2,Nancy Drew Book #15,"I bought this for my niece. She enjoyed it but said it didn't have her sitting on the edge of her seat, like some the other ones do! :) She still liked it, though."
3,A Kid's Review,"The Nancy Drew mystery stories are great books. They are perfect if you want a light but interesting read. But for some reason, I did not really enjoy this one that much. I was O.K but to me, it was not up to the standards of Carolyn Keene. The title seems to be a bit of a misnomer. It is not really about a hunted bridge. It is mostly about Nancy tracking down a woman who is involved in a international ring of jewel theives for her father. But it is a good book and even if you don't really like it, it will probably keep you reading in order to find out what happens in the end."
1,The worst Nancy Drew book in the series,My friend read this book and said it was really boring and even said that if I get it I should sell it! I decided to see for myself if that was true and she was right. The mystery is practically solved in the beginning and the rest is just about some stupid gold tournament.
2,Ok...I'll admit it...it was my worst Nancy Drew.,"Having read almost all the Nancy Drews up to Number 51, I must say this one was one of my least favorites, infact my worst Nancy Drew. There was no suspense, you solved the mystery in the beggining, and there was a golf tournament which basically had nothing to do with it. Plus, it just wasn't as good as one of my fav's like The Clue Of The Broken Locket , etc. I really have enjoyed the other Nancy Drew's!"
2,"Velveetagarbage, Limpgarbage, Sadfan.","Seems we fall into two camps, here. Those who are big fans and outright disappointed in Garbage de-evolving into velveeta rockers, and those who love this stuff. I fall into the first camp. There's just too much good music out there for me to put this bland CD in the player often. Where is the intensity of their earlier music? There are occasional flashes of Garbage's Brialliance but otherwise, it's downright boring. Not bad, just boring. Maybe I was expecting too much?"
2,Don't believe the name,"After waiting a few years for this album to come out I realized, Garbage 2.0 was amazing, this one is not. It's almost as if the group took a lateral step in making music, as if they're trying to find themselves. The record is all over the place and not too enjoyable. I almost get the feeling that this album was made up of B sides."
2,Lackluster,"I was expecting something much better from Garbage, considering that 'Garbage' and 'Version 2.0' were great albums and that they took a lot of time to come up with 'Beautifulgarbage'. I was wrong. 'Beautifulgarbage' is mediocre.Nothing particularly bad here (except for 'Androdyny' and 'Untouchable' - those might better fit a Britney Spears album). Nothing particularly good too, with the notable exception of 'Silence is Golden'. The renaining songs are listenable, but I really don't care about them...I'm going to regard 'Beautifulgarbage' as I regard all of the Highlander movies past the first one. I'm going to pretend it doesn't exist."
3,Interesting,"definately interesting.I'm a long time fan of garbage, the first garbage cd was the first cd I bought and got me interested in rock music.It's a mixed batch of songs, some are good, some aren't so good. They aren't as spooky or cynical as the old garbage which I miss. Shirly's crooning sounds out of place and sometimes cheezy in the destiny's child - like songs.I like the experimental nature of the album though."
4,Great production values!,"The songs on this album mostly suck, but the production is awesome. I'd listen to this album over and over just for the ear candy."
1,Pitiful.,"I think that one word sums up my feelings toward this album. I was a huge Garbage fan until this disaster of a CD showed up. I give them points for making a break into different territory. The only problem is that they seemed to have missed their destination.There is not one remaining piece of the Garbage of old on this album. If you loved the last two, you'll hate this one.... unless you have a taste for meaningless songs that cater to a mainstream pop audience. I never thought I would see the day that Shirley would start to sing like a Britney Spears in training...I am so saddened by this album. Please.... save yourself the money. And let's all hope that Garbage breaks out the guitars again one day."
5,awesome,"Yet another crisis in my life. This is still the album I turn to listen to when I am so depressed I need ""suicide music"". Not going to commit suicide or anything, but when I am really upset and down in the dumps...this is the perfect soundtrack. Deep, emotional tracks. Awesome job, Garbage!"
2,Lacking something....,"I really like their first 2 albums and was eagerly anticipating this one. At first listen you realize it is different and nothing really grabs you. Out of 13 songs, maybe 3 are worth it."
3,"Actually more like a 3 1/2, maybe a 4 just for ""Parade""...","I think I may have purchased this CD with a false pretense, I thought it was going to be something that it wasn't. So when I got it I was a little ""Oh...this is...nice..."" but its an ok cd, I suggest you at least listen to some songs, maybe from the clips or maybe download a song or two off the net...I really the song ""Parade"", ""Androgyny"" got a little annoying after a while, but is still a good song, ""Shut You Mouth"" is an acquired taste that I must not yet have acquired. So, all in all, thumbs up, Skinny."
3,Nothing Special Here,"Seeing as Garbage's first two albums were original, ingenious masterpieces, I bought this one without even listening to any of the sample tracks beforehand.It was a mistake.If you're a big fan of Garbage's earlier work, BeautifulGarbage will probably be a disappointment for you.I think I can understand where this album is coming from - the band and its members are maturing and evolving, and aren't quite so angry any more. However, I don't think that's an excuse to waste Shirley's deep, powerful voice. On many of the tracks she sings in a voice that is higher, clearer, and softer than most of her previous work. I admit it's pretty, but it feels pedestrian in a whole world of pop crooners.This album is lacking in the energy and fury of the first two. It's softer and more monotonous, which makes it more accessible to the general public, but people who have been garbage fans since the beginning may be disappointed."
2,SKIP IT!!!!!!!,"I considered myself a die hard Garbage fan until I bought this CD. Any true Garbage fan would not like this CD, because it is NOT Garbage. They have turned into a completely different band... If you loved their last 2 albums like I did, you will be HUGELY disappointed. Shirley's woice doesn't even sound the same. Some of the other reviews I've read on this site have called it ""Top Notch"", and ""Beautiful"". All I can say is they must have not been listening to the same CD I did. There is absolutely nothing original or groundbreaking about it. The few songs that actually sound like attempts at the old sound, fall way short. ""Shut your mouth"" is the closest to the old sound, and it is boring and repetitive. I hate to be saying all this, because like I said earlier they have always been one of my favorites. All I can say now is ""What were they thinking?"" This one is getting sold back to where I got it."
4,Great Mix of different styles!!!,"Ok, maybe im a hardcore garbage fanatic, but this albulm rocks! Yeah theres alot of different styles but hey, a band needs to be free and change it cant keep kicking out the same songs all the time. I really like Shut your mouth, Androgony, Cup of Coffe, Untouchable, Cherry Lips, and the rest, just a few im not into. But if you like garbage even a bit, its worth looking into"
2,This Garbage is garbage,"I couldn't resist the pun, but I'm disappointed in this CD. I thought their first two CD's were much better. When I was playing ""Cherry Lips (go baby go!)"" I was struck by how much like the Go-Gos the CD was sounding, particularly the recent Go-Gos' CD. (I didn't like the recent Go-Gos' CD as much as their older stuff either...)"
2,What Happened to Garbage?--BEWARE!!,"If Shirely Manson was held down and gang raped by The Cardigans, the resulting bastard child is the person who would be most likely to turn out this CD.Garbage and Version 2.0 were terrific. They didn't sound exactly alike but there seemed to be an almost logical progression from one to the other.Not so here. The synth-y pop sound is common and uninspired and I only wish I could say that Garbage co-opted this sound and turned it to their own purposes instead of being lazy.Yes, it's true that artists have a right to explore and change their sound, but that doesn't mean we have to like it, or buy it.Anyone considering this CD based on their affinity for the previous two CDs should BEWARE and borrow it from a friend or otherwise listen to it first before shelling out any hard earned money."
4,"Not beautiful, but pretty","I'm a big Garbage fan, and I love Shirley Manson's voice, which gets a full workout on this album. I prefer Garbage's previous two albums, as this one has a lot of slower songs, and I think Garbage's upbeat songs are thier strong point. Still, there's plenty to enjoy here, including the addictive Cherry Lips, the haunting Nobody Loves You and the rocking Breaking Up The Girl. Not as cool as the other two albums, but still cool."
3,"Go baby, we're right behind you baby...","Shirley Manson channels insouciance like the Great Ones -- Chrissie Hynde and Deborah Harry. The same attitude of ""Stupid Girl"" from Garbage's first album is made fresh and lively in the opening ""Shut Your Mouth"" of their latest. Garbage also has their fun with bouncy, techno-hypnotic numbers like ""Androgeny"" and ""Go Cherry"". Manson and her bandmates clang with true rockers' chic while still wearing pretentiousness like their favorite gold star badge from the five-and-ten shop. The band seems to be heading towards something even bigger for the future, and this album is the fun ride they have on the way."
2,Who told you this was a good idea to put on the market?,"Dear Garbage,Please turn the synth machine off. I don't know whats been going on these past few years but I haven't liked it. I thought album was awful. I listened to it twice and the only thing that caught my attention was Cherry Lips (which i can't get out of my head) and had I heard that song on the radio Garbage would be the last band i would have though behind it. Clearly the band has ""evolved"" from the moody sounds of their first album, but guess what? That album was good, this one sounds like some assortment of pop [...] that was pulled off free Internet radio stations.Maybe the album is good, and if thats the case then old fans beware, this music isn't for us anymore."
2,Overproduced Garbage,This is one of the worst most over hyped band's in the last 5 or 6 years .This music has no soul at all . Every bass line every chord every vocal sounds very calculated and produced and not very well at that . Shirley Manson is NOT a good singer and the musicians on this album have marginal talent. This band like Gorillaz earlier this year is one experiment that just didn't work out .This band is the Ishtar of music they have been promoted up the ying yang but no one is buying it. This band could be good if they got a new lead singer and if they didn't over calculate every single move they did
2,Old Garbage fans will be disapointed,"I'm so glad i didn't spend money on this cd, i figured sence it was Garbage i was sure to like it, but this album doesn't sound like garbage, its way too mainstream pop. there are only 2 good songs on this whole cd. I was quite disapointed. If you would like to hear good garbage cds, you should pick up there self titled cd and there second, Verison 2.0. they are worth the money. Maybe next time they will go back to there roots from 1995."
4,"might not be garbage, but it's beautiful...","For a band with such broad tastes, it's hard to define Garbage's usual style. Their first two albums spanned angst rock to electronica. With their third release, they seem to be heading in 9 directions at once. Each song seems like it could be done by a different band. You have your traditional Garbage songs like ""Shut your Mouth"" leading the album, but later hearing a 50's style doo-wop (Can't Cry These Tears). The vocals on ""Nobody loves you"" sounds more like Souxsie Sioux than Shirley Manson. And ""Cherry Lips"" is so bright and peppy, it must have been written on a sugar high. With such a broad mix of styles and methods, it might seem like Garabge has lost their direction. But Garbage never really confines themselves to one direction, and that's what makes them, and this album, so great.It's not their greatest work, but it is definetely beautiful."
4,Big fan from their home town!!!,This cd isn't one of their best but it has it's moments. Untouchable is probably the best song on the album and it will gain popularity with Soap oprea watchers as it was used in one of the last episodes of General Hospital. They mix rock with hip hop and some of their songs have a hard rock edge to them but it's never to hard meaning screaming or stuff like that...
4,"It's not Version 2.0, and that's okay. . .","I read your reviews before I bought and was really concerned about the high number of ""hated it""s. Beautiful Garbage is NOT 2.0 - I agree. 2.0 is tighter, more consistent in flow and content, and I think better. That said, Beautiful Garbage is a great disc in its own right. Different from 2.0, which was different from Garbage. No disc hits 14 home runs on tracks, but it's strong. BG evokes multiple moods - it rocks on some songs, wails and mourns on others (and two I just click past). Shirley is strong vocally, and pushes into new styles. Music is tight, and on most tracks is very ""hard"" in the Garbage style fans love and expect. I like BG BECAUSE it's different from 2.0. 3 albums, 3 evolutions in style and substance. If I want Garbage that sounds like 2.0 - I'll pop in 2.0. Beautiful Garbage is a great work, and broadens its appeal to listeners because of its creativity and variety. Don't bash your band for evolving. Everything grows, or it dies."
2,Not Too Good,"I really loved the first two Garbage albums but this one is just sort of flat. Plus, my copy has some sort of copy protection or something on it so it won't play right on my PC which is where I listen to most of my cds. I hope they figure out where they want to go next time before they start the next sessions."
2,Look Elsewhere,"For those who crave the sound of Garbage's previous albums, look elsewhere. Lost are the strong and remorseless sound of 2.0 and what you end up with is smooth, overly-polished, boring mess."
2,Shirley Spears?,"This is simply not Garbage. I love it when bands try something new, but they shouldn't make a complete different type of music. Some tracks are simply terrible, like ""Can't cry these tears"" or ""'til the day that I die"" and only very few tracks are ok, like ""Silence is Golden"" or ""Andragony""...finally, if you want to get into some really good music, by the debit an Version 2.0"
1,They should have released this using a different name,"Simply, this album absolutely blows, and this comes from an old-school fan of GARBAGE and the GARBAGE 'sound,' none of which this album contains (aside from possibly the first track, which sounds like a throw away from 2.0). While the songs are intricate, and obviously performed by accomplished musicians, they aren't very memorable and sadly sound nothing like GARBAGE, coming across more like a Britney Spears - Jessica Simpson hyrbid. I'm actually quite irritated that I spent money on this album. If Vig, Manson, et al., wanted to experiment sonically so far away from the GARBAGE 'sound,' they should have released this album under a different name. Of course, given that they have a built-in consumer base, why would they? The label undoubtedly knew that fans of the band would rush out to buy their third studio album, and they did. Sadly, this is one fan who won't make that mistake again."
1,The name fits,"Unfortunately, I was unable to find any talent that warrants the plastic the data was burned on. About the only thing I can say is the name of the band fits perfectly the description of the music and its style."
1,"NOT FOR FANS OF GARBAGE, GARBAGE 2.0, or BLEED LIKE ME","My boyfriend and I both LOVE the first two CDs by Garbage, but when we picked up Beautiful Garbage today... It wasn't what either of us expected, and not in a good way.If you love Garbage for the dark undertones, Shirley Manson's incredible voice, the techno, the energy... this album doesn't have it.If you like light sounding pop, this CD is all for you. Shirley's voice is good, but it doesn't have that sultry sound to it that made me love her. I'm sure there will be times when I'll pop this CD in and be fine listening to it, but this just is not the ""Garbage"" I love."
1,"and like a disposable diaper, this CD needs to be tossed!","First off, my actual score for this incredibly rotten record is ZERO stars!!!Gone is the super song writing and stellar performances of the first two Garbage records. What we have left on this mess of really inferior songs - is true throw away, mtv-like (ashley simpson, mariah carey, no d....) rubbish(no pun intended). The listener will not find the brilliant adventurous rock/pop Garbage I & II here... even the great production does not save this release...buy at your own risk - mine is being traded back in and hopefully the band will find their way back to the land of good songs..."
2,Garbage.,"Hey Shirley... Toni Halliday and Belinda Butcher called. They said ""knock it off!""the first single is the most annoying thing I've heard this side of any Smashing Pumpkins song where the music stops and Billy starts talking (""Zero,"" ""Everlasting Gaze,"" et al.) A couple redeeming songs on the second half, but stick with Version 2.0 if you want the closest thing these guys have done to a solid release."
4,more great garbage,"i think this is an excelent addition to anyones cd collection. this albumn has a bit more pop and bounce to it than their other two previous albumns. its a very, very good albumn. i suggest you buy it immediatly."
2,I don't want to write this,"I bought all the early singles. Rushed out and got the albums on the day of release. I bought Garbage records unheard. Seen them live loads of times.I *really* wanted to like this album.It's just not that good compared to the last two. Really it isn't. There are too many weak songs hidden with nice packaging and over-produced effects. However, there are a couple of good tracks here, notabley: 'So Like a Rose.' Some tracks will get Garbage a shack load of air play probably, hopefully new listeners will buy the back catalogue.Buy this one second-hand, or better yet, buy Gift by Curve."
2,"Long wait, disappointing","After waiting years for the release of a new Garbage album, I was really disappointed with this one. I listened to it several times to try to force myself to like it, but no luck. The first two albums were a wonderful mix of dark electronic and pop, but I can't figure out where this album is going. I realize that artists need to evolve and change musically, but I still don't like this CD. Do yourself a favor and buy 2.0 instead. Two stars anyway for the lovely Shirley."
2,Garbage no more...,"I purchased this CD with my anticipation, but ended up with nothing much but something I wouldn't mind selling.Compared to Garbage's past two albums, truly this CD comes no where close to comparison. The new material on this album has become to diluted with so much digital sounds that it sounds like the material could be produced for Britney Spears. The only two great songs from this CD is Shut Your Mouth and Androgyny. The rest do not leave a memorable imprint as their past songs. Their direction surely has changed, and I am not saying that it is a bad thing, just totally different from what I had expected. I have hope still for their next released album, maybe their material would be much stronger. Until then, I recommend Garbage's debut album, Garbage, and version 2.0, where you can expect to find and hear great content."
2,What happenned?,"I bought this CD when advised not to. ""Too poppy"" I was told. I guess I'm a hard-core fan, because I'd loved their previous albums and couldn't (wouldn't) believe that they could miss with this one.Beautiful Garbage certainly moves away from the electronic lean of their previous releases and into ground that makes me wonder if they'd simply run out of ideas.This album lacks the emotion of their previous discs, which saddens me because that's what endeared me to this group in the first place. It has a retro-airy-pop feel to it that leaves you feeling sort of empty when the songs are finished. Perhaps that's because as a fan I'm really wanted more.Some tunes I enjoyed. ""Cherry-Lips"" for instance is catchy and radio friendly and ""Cup of Coffee"" had something about it, but there are too many fillers on this album. I don't want to judge them too harshly, as I think these guys are great, but it didn't work for them this time."
3,"Well, its interesting at least","After listening to the new cd a few times I have to say I mostly like it. Every song has a different style and while only a few of them actually sound like the Garbage we know and love, overall its not too bad of an album. Most of the album is just too pop for my tastes. I had these images of Britany Spears remaking half the songs and got shudders. A few songs like Nobody Loves You, Cup of Coffee, Shut Your Mouth, and Androgny are pretty good though. Its not their best, but hey, every good musical group should have the chance to play with their sound. This cd will stay in my collection next to the others, and I'll await the next release."
3,A huge let down,"This album is a horrible album. What happened to Garbage? What happened to the darkness? It's transformed into light, happy songs. It still has a strange theme with it (Songs about crossdressers, androgynous people, and depression) But the depression is light.I'll admit I like some of the songs...most of the songs are good, but I'm just disappointed in Garbage. I liked it when their music made me gloomy."
1,garbage indeed,"i would have given this album a rating of 0 stars, but i didn't have that option. so, unfortunately i was forced to rate it higher than it deserves. i loved garbage and version 2.0, but beautifulgarbage is awful. i don't know, maybe shirley and the boys are getting old, cos this album is adult contemporary!it's like george lucas following the original 3 star wars movies with the repugnant phantom menace, but i digress. i returned my copy. i suggest that you save your money for something good."
2,stuck somewhere between great and [uninteresting],"After listening to this album I felt that about hald the songs were good and about half were boring and felt really uninspired. Androgyny, Untouchable, Breaking up the Girl and Cherry Lips are all great songs hat I fell in love with in just one listen and Till I Die and Shut Your Mouth are good and managed to grow on me after a few listens. The rest of the album just bores the hell out of me. I tried to force myself to listen to them more then once and I just couldn't do it, they're just completely uninteresting songs. It's nice to try and be experimental, but only if it works and the only songs I liked were the ones that at least sort of followed their old ways, so hopefully they go back to the old formula after this album or I might not buy another."
2,A complete disappointment,"Version 3.0 is one of my favorite albums of all time. Needless to say, I'd been anxiously awaiting Garbage's follow-up to it. Unfortunately, it's a huge disappointment.What makes Garbage such a great band is that their music is usually upbeat and rockin. This album is brooding, slow, unoriginal, and frankly boring. A newspaper review I read called it, ""a step backward for the band"". I couldn't agree more.There are a couple of exceptions like ""Androgyny"" and the fun Disco-throwback song ""Cherry Lips"", but the music is so over-produced and synthesized that they will never be able to reproduce it live.One of these days, bands are going to learn that their fans don't like change. Hopefully Garbage will figure this out and go back to making their own brand of unique rock."
4,all over the place,"go baby go is cool. rest is good. far better than most of the junk on the radio. a nice break from all the Creed crud and faux-punk that is devouring radio. i miss the rockin' stuff, but bet they'll do more of that on the next one.if the donnas could get production this good, they'd rule the world."
4,Interesting,"A self-congratulatory tribute to Cold-War American culture? Shirl is too clever to put out...hmm, something just for that. It's easy to call 'Beautifulgarbage' simply an homage/mockery of capitalism and its toll on the history of music, art and culture, though such label is enough to put the band in artistic vanguard. Aside the postmodern, tongue-in-cheek style, Garbage has achieved a technical and creative feat, per se, as a rebellious, intelligent teen persona kicking the corporate and the high cultures in the balls with a stiletto. Absolutely fabulous!Is it post-rock? post-pop? Many have charged it with being boring; a more logical charge would be that it is merely interesting. (That is, whether it'll make frequent trips into my own CD player is another question.) The voice of the individual still comes out--through the lyrics, singing with universal empathy and sympathy. As the album shows us, the best way to criticize something is to embrace it. Garbage is Beautiful."
5,best yet,"Beautifulgarbage takes the spirit and emotional energy of the previous two Garbage albums and adds a more mature flavor (both musically and emotionally). The earlier experiments with tempo switches and rhythm disruptions are more sophisticated and interesting. The lyrics have an older-wiser-sadder feel to them.On an earlier album the question is asked, ""Would you like me better if we slept together?"" On this album the answer to that is assumed, and we get lyrics like, ""Of course we can't be friends, not while I'm still this obsessed.""People who thought Garbage was garbage probably still won't like this album, but I think this is easily their best work."
3,Their Dirty Work,"Garbage used to have a real bite to their music and their lyrics. This is all posturing - much like latter day Stones, where the hard edge of Gimme Shelter gives way to Harlem Shuffle. Their are some decent songs, but Shut Your Mouth and others like it try to be tough, but just end up being foolish and [weak]."
4,Evolving Garbage,"It takes a lot of work for a band to evolve, and after 6 years Garbage has let their sound go free. With only faint twinges of their previous two albums present in Beautifulgarbage (Parade, Androgeny) Garbage is taking a great step out into the new band sound. Hopefully, this new album Garbage fans have been anticipating for so long will satisfy-it's not the Garbage we once knew, but a less techno based, more guitar centered sound."
5,AWESOME,"I must say that I am WOWED by this record! Every track is a must hear and I personally guarantee that beautifulgarbage is not a record you will be able to stop listening to! It's been out for over a month, and I STILL can't get it out of my cd player! It's just that damn great!"
4,Oh so beautiful...,"Garbage had never ceased to amaze me. With each album, they mature and develope their music into an ever-changing wonder. Their first album had a rock feel while in Version 2.0, they got a little more pop. In beautifulgarbage, you can't really describe the general tone of the album because there is so much variety. From the hip-hop sound of Shut Your Mouth, to the rock ballad Breaking Up the Girl, to the unexpected infectious Cherry Lips, Garbage reinvents themselves with each song while somehow retaining that certain unexplainable quality about them that we love so much."
3,I,"I was surprised at the less-angered tone of this album. I love Garbage for their dark sound and great beat. ""Beautifulgarbage"" just seems to lose what the previous albums had. This is much more mellow sounding and ""sweet"" overall. The techno sound is gone and in its place is a more ""Cardigan"" sounding collection. Shirley has a sexy voice; unfortunately a lot of the songs are sung in a higher-pitched ""sweet"" tone and it just doesn't sound as good. If you're a devoted Garbage fan, buy it just to hear their diversity. If you're looking for great lyrics or rhythms that existed in their last albums, skip it and go for Poe."
5,Garbage new CD,"Garbage has released it's 3 album. It is a lot softer than past CD's. I have heard from the net that they have gone girly girl. Not true. Everyone's style changes a little bit. This CD is a little slower that usual. Most of the songs seem to be ""break up"" style. It's not as most garbage fans have known. But...for the true fans willing to open their minds. This CD is great!!!!! Judge for yourself. They have a little bit of the mixing,even a 50'style song."
2,Couple of ok songs. Little else,"I loved V2, but this CD really disappointed. It doesn't even sound like (or maybe it does) Garbage. Androgeny is OK, Cherry Lips is alright, but maybe I'm just making myself listen to them, so I feel like I got some value out of the CD. I would use it for a coffee coaster, if it weren't pink. Good thing I got my Blair Witch CD for that..."
3,pretty good,"I don't think this is the best from Garbage compared to the loud vibes from the first two, but it is still very good. Just a lot softer. Referring to a song on Version 2.0 (When I Grow Up), it appears that Shirley 'Grew Up'. A more mature album."
1,Garbage-It is this time around,"If you are a fan of Garbage like I am, and have been anticipating a great album as thier two previous ones are, then you will be very very disappointed. There are at least 5 slow songs and there are no fast electronic, beat pumping songs like paranoid or any of thier previous efforts. The third song sounds like a girl group song of the 60's. This cd is very disappointing. Maybe they will get back to the old style soon. I would listen to mp3's of this cd before buying."
3,Not Great,"This CD isn't half as good as the previous albums released by Garbage. Don't buy it, only get the Androgyny single."
1,Beauty is in the eye...,"Garbage's third album sounds almost nothing like their previous releases, and for me that's a huge disappointment. This time they've traded in the guitar grit and good tunes for a giant polished piece of studio tripe.I can't really see Garbage converting anyone with this release, and they're certainly in danger of losing a lot of old-school fans. Really the only good songs on the album are ""Shut Your Mouth"", and, well, that's about it. I'm not sure who they're trying to appeal to, but I don't think it's going to work.It's really too bad, because until now they were one of the best this country had to offer.As far as I'm concerned, this album is a very large misstep."
2,Frustrating!,"I've been trying to digest this album for a couple of months now. I thought it might be like Badly Drawn Boy, where the majesty slowly dawns on you - no such luck. I dig the lyrics and totaly respect the empowering message, but that's about it. Their electronic elements sound thin and inexperienced. Too frequently, their guitar and drum riffs roar up only to suddenly disappear. When they do keep charging, it sounds crashy and disjointed. They start some interesting trends on this album, but there's no coherency. I hope they bring it back together on their next album. This one's going in the 'for sale' bin."
3,garbage?,very very disappointing. it wasn't the kind of sound i expected and it wasn't up to their standards musically OR lyrically. sad.
4,Good but not version 2.0,"This album is good, but not as good as version 2.0. Version 2.0 just seemed a lot more ""put together"". This album, in my opinion, is better than the 1st album, garbage. I would definintely recommend anyone who liked the 1st 2 albums to buy this one."
5,The title of this CD say's it all,"A far more mature sound from garbage, it's definitly them from the 1st song to the last, it's not v3 that some where hoping for but for me it's better, special favs are Cheery Lips and Untouchable."
2,Beautiful Trash,"Ok, the bottom line is if youre a new fan, this is not the album for you, b/c you will simply get the wrong idea about Garbage. They are not a frothy pop band who sometimes creates fantastic rock songs, and spends most of their albums wallowing in musical limbo, as ""Beautiful Garbage"" suggests. If your a new fan get their latest ""Bleed like me"", or their first disc ""Garbage"".As for this trashy attempt at a record, it just doesnt cut it. Every song sounds like a bad demo with the exception of 3 songs, the highly intelligent ""Shut Your Mouth"", the best possible pop song of the 2001 "" Cherry Lips ( Go baby go)"", and the heartbreaking and incredibly poignant ""Cup of Coffee"". These songs and my love for Garbage is what made me give this throaway album the 2 stars instead of none. Do yourself a favorand skip the pointless and cliche work on ""Silence is Golden"", ""Breaking up the girl"", and ""Parade"", and go out and buy their fantastic new album ""Bleed like me""."
2,Not good.,"I'm a huge Garbage fan. Have no problem with the band trying something new; however, it's not just a departure...it's Garbage selling out on their original sound and feel. It's sad to see another great band moving along down the mainstream of (yuck) pop music in hopes of better sales."
1,Very disappointing...,"Nothing like Version 2.0 - in fact, I'm not sure what exactly happened to the band. Don't bands usually get BETTER with age?Thankfully, I received this as a GIFT and didn't spend my hard-earned cash here... however, it's definitely going to be collecting dust. ""Shut Your Mouth"" is a fairly decent song, and it was a good way to start the album... ""Androgyny"" and ""Til the Day I Die"" aren't too bad... but ""Cherry Lips"" is downright irritating and sing-songy, and all of the other songs are melodramatic and unimaginative, overall a pretty boring album.Don't waste your money if you're a fan of their music... there's a reason that most radio stations aren't talking up a storm about this cd like they did for Version 2.0. :P If you get the cd as a gift as I did, see if you get can the receipt and TAKE IT BACK for some QUALITY music.What a disappointment!!"
1,3 years of waiting for this .... Garbage,"Well, It's the end of Garbage as knew and loved them. They're done. I was afraid this was going to happen. The first two albums were stellar. A fantastic mix of pop / alternative / and dance/techno for lack of a better description. This new album has a few flashes of that brilliance but utlimately falls flat into monotony. The songs seem so uninspired. It shocks me to think that it took 3 years to make this ablum when it sounds like it took 3 months.(...)"
1,Ughh-what happened to my beloved Garbage?,"Garbage's first two albums are great, both easily belong in my ""10 that I would bring to the deserted isle list"" .Unfortunately, Beautifulgarbage seems to be aimed more at the Madonna/Britney Spears pop crowd. I've given it four listenings so far, and suspect that it will soon be relegated to the used bins at my local CD shop."
3,Don't Bother,"Really not all that bad but I expect much more in a Garbage LP. I ran out of my way to go get it the first day it came out, it wasn't really worth getting. Doesn't even compare to Garbage and Version 2.0."
3,Not as good as 2.0,"Both of the first two CD's are in my car right now, and have been there for days. I can just put on those two cd's and listen over and over even though they are no longer new. Androgyny blew me away the first time I heard it. A few other songs(Cherry Lips, Untouchable) are pretty cool, but don't sound like Garbage. I really like it when a band tries new musical directions, but only when it is an improvement. The dropoff from 2.0 to Beautiful Garbage is as drastic as Rush's Moving Pictures to Signals. Both follow-ups are OK, but pale in comparison to their predecessor."
2,How Dissapointing.,"I loved version 2.0 and the original Garbage because of how different they were. They were a hard type of electronica rock, they did all types of music ranging from pop, to jazz, alternative, hip hop, a little bit of country, and of course rock. This entire cd sounds like Britney Spears to me. Everything sounds so incredibly fake. It sounds like those little kiddie keyboards you buy.. and Shirley Mansons vocals has lost it's touch entirely lost in all this. True the lyrics might be deeper and more personal but some words that seem to be sad lose the feeling when there sang in these throw away happy go lucky poppish songs.Don't get me wrong, pop is great to listen to. Just... not this kind. And if you are into teen pop and music like this.. think about it.. would you rather this kind of music being performed by (Ugh) Nsync and 98 degrees, or a bunch of 40 year olds who have lost there touch?"
4,Better than mostly everything else,This another solid album from the only band like themselves out there. Though not as strong as Garbage 2.0 this one goes to a couple places that the band has not been before. Go buy this album and be happy it's not Limp Bizkit or incubis.
4,"Shimmery, shiny pop confection","Shirley's all grown up, and it turns out that love ain't what she thought it would be. Tender songs of unrequited love? That's not really her style. Shirley's got it bad. This is the kind of love that her mother presumably warned her about! The album is looser and grittier than ""Version 2.0"". It's the standard flashy, trashy Garbage that we've heard on ""Garbage"" and ""V2.0"".As usual, Shirley is right out there in front: sneering, sighing, grabbing her crotch and tearing into some willing victim. The plaintive ""Cup of Coffee"" is powerful in its simplicity and restraint. Two songs, ""Shut Your Mouth"" and ""Til The Day I Die"" are loud and crunchy, featuring lots of guitars. Shirley seems to relish chewing on these songs before moving on to the next one.Recommended."
1,"A new concept for Garbage, but rather disappointing...","To say that Garbage has changed its sound is quite an understatement. Garbage has completely evolved into a more of a pop band, mixed with electronic elements. I liked the Garbage's self titled album a lot, and was looking fowards to Beautiful Garbage, (unreasonably so).The title of the first single, ""Shut Your Mouth"", sounds quite like the old Garbage- much more in your face. However, don't judge the book by its cover. Their whole sound is watered down into the same old pop syrup. Unlike their previous CDs there aren't really any real intricate grooves played by the band, and Shirley's vocals have lost their typical abrasive-like quality that I enjoyed. Every single track encompasses the same idea as the first track and is not slightly intriguing.Basically, Garbage sold out like No Doubt did with Rock Steady."
5,Such beautiful Garbage!,"This album rocks. The best ones are Cherry Lips, Silence Is Golden and the first single, Androgyny. Long-time fans may get disappointed because it is so different from the previous albums. There's almost no 'feels like techno' on the songs. Anyway it is a great rock title."
2,Gone is the complexity and caustic edge....,"Anxiously awaiting new material for months...this CD is a disappointment. Gone from the mix is the complexity so vital to Garbage's sound on their previous work. Gone is the mean edge...Gone are the the extreme ranges of Shirley's vocals...for what now sounds like a 60s sweetheart, slightly sad, sound... I really hate to say it, but I think Version 2.0 was the apex for Garbage...and this album lacking any pictures in the linear notes except for very plain headshots of the band under the CD, only confirms the very striped-down and sadly deflated sound of this new material."
3,is this a garbage cd?,"i have to be honest and say that this cd is a little bit disappointing...i actually was expecting a more alternative sound (according to an article i read regarding this cd months ago), don't get me wrong or anything, I am a die hard garbage fan, but i favor their old work. they have evolved into something completely different and have seemed to stray away from their old alternative roots and settled for a more mainstream pop sound. I honestly thought i had a jessica simpson cd in there or something, but i find some tracks fathomable like ""adrogyny"" or ""shut yout mouth,"" everything else just doesn't appeal to me. I wish they stuck to their old stuff. Overall, if you can deal with their new bubble-gum pop sound then buy it, but if you appreciated their alternative stuff, this isn' t your best bet."
1,Garbage Indeed,"Really, this was one of the worst albums I bought in 2001. A major dissapointment. I loved the first Garbage album, thought the second one was ok, but this one is really lousy. I don't mind bands trying new directions, but the hodgepodge of styles on this album simply don't make the cut. I can't understand how in the world it ended up on so many best of the year lists and the high ratings it has received here."
2,Taking steps backward,"Some bands see an evolution in their sound, while others change it completely. Unfortunately, this represents the latter for Garbage. Instead of building off of V2.0, they came back with something that is so scattered, it's hard to listen to all the way through. I'm sure most fans would agree that while we didn't want V3.0, we didn't want this either. Pretty disappointing considering how spectacular the last album was from start to finish. I will say that the album has grown on me after repeated listenings, but only slightly. Don't pay full price if you want to buy this album. Look for it used, or on sale."
1,terrible,"Do I have to even give this one a star?!?I absolutely love previous Garbage titles, but Beautiful Garbage is horrible. I have been sickened listening to it. Nothing at all what I expected from this group. Sounds like *pop* music to me, yeck!"
2,What Happened?,"Version 2.0 was my favorite album of 1998. I regarded Garbage as one of the great bands of thier time, but this album is something alot dfferent than thier previous two - for the worse!It sounds like a manufactured pop group album, especially ""Untouchable"". There is a few alright songs on here ""Shut your mouth"", ""Parade"", ""Silence is golden"". I know Garbage has always been a ""pop"" group to say the least, but ""beautifulgarbage"" is nothing at all compared to Version 2.0. I don't think old Garbage fans will like this too much...."
1,pure garbage,Britney Spears goes on a Magical Mystery Tour AND IT AINT GOOD. Perhaps the MOST overproduced record of the decade. Sheer dung.
3,Just o.k.,"I was gradually drawn into ""Version 2.0"" by hearing cut after cut until I finally bought it and really loved it. Therefore my expectations of this were very high. I was let down in so many ways. For one no matter how much I try to like ""Androgony"" I keep thinking it sounds like something Christina Aguilera would do. ""Cherry Lips"" drew me in right away but by about 3 listens I was tired of it already. ""Shut Your Mouth"" and ""Til the Day I Die"" are good but two good tracks do not make a good c.d. All the other material is marginal at best. Let's hope they rebound and make a record as good as the first two next time around."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This sounds more retro than something new.Seems like Garbage didn't have any new ideas.I almost feel like I've heard the album a hundred times, because all songs sound the same, and everything is so familiar - 70s, 80s, and 90s. Nothing new, really.It's a shame that Garbage are already out of ideas - this is only their 3rd album!I've been their fan since 1996, but this is no good."
5,"""You sprung the mojo and it worked like a charm...""","Beautifulgarbage is garbage's best album in my opinion. My favorite is Version 2.0 but this album is their best. All 13 songs are fun,exhilrating,and brilliant. Shirley Manson is a genius, no one sounds like her, the songs would be nothing without her powerful voice. Songs i cannot live without include:Til the day that i die, shut your mouth, drive you home, so like a rose, cup of coffee, silence is golden, and cherry lips. The lyrics are sarcastic which is always great since that's part of Shirley's wicked personality. ""Welcome we love you, we hate you, we wish we were like you..."" The song Nobody loves you is so personal it's scary:""You know you'll always be my man but grab yourself sweetness where you can, 'cause sooner or later we're gonna die left to the dogs under the sky."" Beautifulgarbage is so refreshing. This album really picks my spirits up on a crummy day. Don't pass this gem up, it will be the best ""garbage"" in your cd collection."
3,Beautiful BeautifulGarbage,"The new album from Garbage is definately a step in a new direction. It is much more of a pop record. Losing the dark nature of the previous two releases. Ever present are the strong melodies and enchanting Manson voice you expect from Garbage. While this record is not their best, it certainly warrants a listen. True Garbage fans will like it and it should bring a legion of new, more mainstream fans..."
5,La Strada,This is what film making is all about . Everything is done with taste. And Very good acting..Time has made it even better. I remember seeing this when i was a young teenager . And I love it then as i do now. A classic in every way A+ from me...
5,La Strada,One of my favorite movies and a must have for any collection. I am extremely satisfied with the condition of the DVD. I bought it new and have no problems.
5,Masina is so fun to watch,"Giullietta Masina is truly a great comic actress and her husband directs her very well in this classic Fellini film.Criterion (despite the outragous prices) knows how to treat great films - they are always restored nicely, usually have special features, and are well-packaged. This is a great addition to any dvd collection - and is a film that will live in your memory."
5,Easily among the Top 10 films of all time,"Before Fellini entered into his abstract, metaphorical fantastical body of work, everything was stripped away in this heartbreaking story of circus strongman Zampano (Quinn) and his meek and loyal assistant Gelsomina (Fellini's wife Giulietta Masina), whom he takes out his misery and fustrations upon through constant abuse. While Richard Basehart's 'Il Matto' serves to distract him from his usual victim Gelsomina, it is only temporary, which leads towards a tragic conclusion. If you want to see filmmaking and storytelling at its most basic and effective, 'La Strada' is a must."
4,La Strada is a great clown movie,"This film is considered by many to be Fellini's best. Anthony Quinn is just astounding as the rough gruff strong man Zampano. He is equally matched by Fellini's wife Giulletta Massina, who plays the simpleton Gelsomina a woman who is bought by Zampano to use in his street show, and despite the fact that she is treated abysmally, she falls in love with Zampano. An equally amazing performance is given by Richard Basehart as Il Matto (literally, The Fool) who goads Zampano into an outrageous act of cruelty. This film is funny, beautiful, and moving, and well worth seeing, even with subtitles. There are several great circus and clown scenes in it, but it's the performances, especially by Quinn and Massina that make this film a classic."
4,"I laughed, I cried, it was better than Cats!",That is Fellini's real life wife? Judging by the chicks his alter-ego pulls in 8 1/2 I would have thought him to be into better looking women. Her Chaplin routine is top.
5,A Fellini for Fans and Non-Fans Alike,"I've never been able to warm to most of Fellini's ""classic"" films: a few memorably imaginative sequences lost in a deluge of party scenes and idle chit-chat. ""La Strada,"" however, is a remarkable and beautiful accomplishment. Giulietta Masina's lovable conflation of Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx is both endearing and moving; rarely has a simple-minded but good-hearted character been portrayed with such sensitivity. Anthony Quinn is equally fine in his own way, and the film makes a strong impression that is not easily forgotten, even days (or years) later. Just wonderful."
5,A real gem not to be missed,"One of the best films you'll ever see. Anthony Quinn is great as a small time circus performer going from city to city performing his same routine of breaking a chain for handouts from the crowd. He buys Gelsomina from a poor distraught family who previously sold him another daughter Rosa who died recently. Gelsomina is an irresistable, cute, Charlie Chaplin-like assistant to the brutish Zampano, who views her as a necessary part of his trade, but treats her coldly. His cruelty is highlighted when in one town he treats her to a nice supper, but then picks up a voluptuous girl right in front of her and rides off leaving Gelsomina behind. When the pair come upon a traveling circus, the trouble starts between Zampano and Richard Basehart as ""The Fool"". The fool taunts Zampano into a flying rage that... This is movie-making at it's best. Do not miss this masterpiece."
5,"FELLINI'S TRAGIC, POETIC MASTERPIECE","LA STRADA (Criterion) is Federico Fellini's tragic masterpiece. Giulietta Masina, Fellini's wife, is wide-eyed, innocent Gelsomina, who's sold by her mother to Zampano (Anthony Quinn), a brutal strongman. Although treated like an animal, she falls in love with Zampano. Joining a traveling circus, they meet his rival, tightrope artist Fool (Richard Basheart), who charms Gelsomina and taunts Zampano. Unable to control his hatred of Fool, nor be ""saved"" by Gelsomina's pure love, Zampano and Gelsomina are thrown out of the circus. This poetic tale of love and cruelty is almost Biblical and a basic element of any serious video library."
4,It's Quinn's movie for me,"When I see this move now I am fast-forwarding past certain scenes that are too propagandistic. Quinn is the beautiful one in this move, to my mind they ""used"" his energy and purity to frame Fellini's wife as a ""star."" Quinn is the real heartbreaking one here and you can see it all over the screen. Just my opinion."
4,La Strada's English Soundtrack,"In response to Stephen Lopez:I,too,contactedCriterion regarding the English track.I receivedthe same reply.However,I can't accept theiranswer because some years back,Criterion releasedLa Strada on laserdisc (a now-defunct video mediumused mainly by videophiles before the advent of DVDs)which I've owned since its release.The English soundtrack on this LD is flawless...nota single ""dropoff"" from start to finish.So...my hunch is that somebody at Criterion fouledup somehow and the result is several minutes ofmissing audio.I'm still happy,however,that I purchased the DVDbecause the video quality is outstanding!"
5,The way...to where?,"I first saw this film when I was 21. Its simplistic symbolism left me cold. I saw it again, 10 years later. It's simplistic symbolism made me weep. And I knew why. Yes, La Strada is a movie with a very mundane premise (as is life) which reduces the man/woman relationship to its most base. Men, at their most primal, are selfish brutes. Woman, left unnutured, are masochistic twits. Fellini offers a stark and staggering perspective of humanity which forces us to relate to characters whom we see as appaulling and pathetic, yet are uncomfortably close to all of us, left with the same options. The ending is obvious, but it says it all. BTW: Woody Allen made a regrettable remake of La Strada entitled ""Sweet and Lowdown"", No credit was given to the original (as far as I know.)"
2,a flawed masterpieece,"This is possible one of the ten best films ever released but Criterion has botched it. The English titles are very hard to read and, at times, the English soundtrack, is mute - mouths move but no sound can be heard. At their high prices, Criterion never should have released this."
2,Mistaken Identity,"This may be a wonderful and informative book, but it is intended (I think) for the advanced student or professional in the field. I have a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Art so I'm not stupid, but I found the books incomprehensible."
4,I love this thing!,I was a bit skeptical about this because I had a very bad experience with another MP3 player but I love this thing.I can record all my favorite songs on here from my CDs and tapesand carry them with me. It makes my commute from work so much easier to tolerate!
4,Very Good,"This product kicks. I havent used it in a while, but I'm getting back into it. And with places like iMusic.com this is a good combo of preforance and memory."
1,Practical but kindergarten level advice,This book is truly overrated - I think the author should have been more inventive with suggestions - most mom's know these things but life is too busy to implement them - this book did not help - for instance buy at the deli instead of fast food - at the store deli you have to park go in choose check out go home divide and conquer instead of voila - DRIVE-THRU! Give us something that is new and worth reading in the next book - maybe title it How to Get Overweight Kids Healthy Again - Tips You Can Use to Help Them Lose. Good luck next time - this one is a bust.
1,Very few recipes,"This book is pretty uninformative. It is mostly advice on how to get your kids to lose weight by not feeding them junk food. If you care enough to pick up this book, you probably already know everything that it says. I was hoping for recipes and good ideas for my husband's lunch, and there are just not that many recipes in here, and the ones that are in here are really not great for adults. Not to mention that half the recipes (which aren't many) are for breakfast and dinner, not lunch. If you are looking for recipes, I would get ""The Healthy Lunchbox"" (yes, same title) by Marie McClendon, which is actually all recipes."
5,Practical advice!!!,"Finally a readable, common sense approach to feeding my kids. This book has many realistic ideas and useable recipes for a busy mom like me. Thankfully, my kids are already physically active, but this book has given me new ideas and notions to ensure that my kids stay active. Good job Dr. McAllister!!!"
4,Solid piece of work,"I thought that this was a nice resource for my time in New Orleans, which was regretfully short (only three days). I will caution that I pretty much never left the French Quarter - Hotel Monteleone was gorgeous and comfy! - so I can't speak for the other areas detailed in the book. The maps are excellent, and the restaurant suggestions matched my boyfriend's personal experiences."
4,A good source of excuses and apologia for FBI mistakes,"Christopher Whitcomb is the self-admitted propaganda officer forthe Critical Incident Response Group - and this book is a majorpiece of their efforts at public persuasion. It is well written,but the reader should keep in mind that Chris needs to playthe ""good guy"" and is unwilling, or unable, to admit hisemployer's continuing flaws. To read his telling, the FBI hasbeen completely revamped and no longer has a heavy hand inrepressing legitimate dissent in this country, (or Puerto Rico).I think 1,300 detained muslim men might argue with that notion. [...]"
4,Very interesting,"I happened to just pick this book up and read the synopsis of the book. The synopsis intrigued me to want to read more. I find every type of law enforcement, or military training book fascinating. The hostage rescue team was not a team I was familiar with. These personnel are equivalent to the military's special forces in my opinion. This team trains constantly and is able to respond to incidents immediately. The training these members attend are unbelievable, it makes me feel much safer knowing a team like this exists. I would definately recommend this book to those of you who find sniper stories intersting, or the unbelievable training and expertise that these personnel acheive."
4,"Good read, but an FBI rah-rah","Engrossing, especially if you like ""tactical"" literature and detail from behind the scenes. Surprisingly literate writing for a black-helicopter kind of guy. Caveat: Whitcomb is an unabashed cheerleader for the FBI, so some of his opinions should be taken with a small grain of salt."
5,cold zero,"i could not put the book down i even read it twice, and i can wait for the next book. mr. whitcomb wrote in a way,that made you feel that you was with him looking into the scope. super job."
1,BE WARNED,"Look elsewhere when purchasing this book. The suggested retail price on the back cover is $7.99, but after paying vender's listed price and S&H totals to ~$19. What a rip-off!!!"
1,BE WARNED,"Look elsewhere other than ""bobsellingbooks"" aka - OwlsBooks when purchasing this book. The suggested retail price on the back cover is $7.99, but after paying vender's listed price and S&H totals to ~$19. What a rip-off!!!"
3,Not As Good As I Hoped,"This book gives a look at the selection and training for HRT, which is quite fascinating. Unfortunately, he limits his discussion two a few major incidents (in all fairness, he probably had to). Mr. Whitcomb paints a good picture of the boredom faced by men in his position when telling the Waco story. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in counter-terrorism units, the FBI or sniping."
2,"Lot's of bravado, very little concern for The Law","Seems like Mr. Whitcomb revels in having taken part in the murders at Ruby Ridge and Waco.This guy should probably be in jail for his involvement in those disasters, along with a lot of other HuRT members. Still, the book is an above average read, if you like a lot of fiction mixed with the facts."
3,"Could use some ""meat""","This is an interesting read and Chris does mention several high profile incidents but it would have been better as a ""this is my life book"" as opposed to any real 'meat' but I don't think it would have done as well if he had so--hat's off....He certainly has had an interesting career but the book winds down into a staff job with a sort of spin that is meant to keep the reader interested but doesn't. If you are reading a book of this nature you want to ""be there"" as was the case on several of the high profile occasions which were certainly introspective but less than exciting considering the modern warfare played out today in CT.I do compliment him though on his service and the courage to write something about the topic because he is the only one to my knowledge that has."
5,THE BEST!,"I highly recommend this book. It opens your eyes to what these heroic people do everyday to protect us. Chris Whitcomb's descriptions make you feel like you were there. The amount of training that goes with becoming part of the Hostage Rescue Team is rough. The elements that these men and I hope women have to endure to get the bad guys. He also sheds the TRUE light on what happend at Ruby Ridge and Waco. Washington with their ""Cover your ..."" attitude and how the FBI, HRT and RENO were the scape goats. I dont know how anyone could have thought David Karesh and his followers as well as Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge were not dangerous. Everything was attempted to get these criminals out alive. David Karesh and Randy Weaver sealed their own fate. ANYWAY, my point is GET THIS BOOK!!!"
5,Great book!,This was an excellent novel and for someone who wishes to enter the FBI I found it very inspiring.
3,Cold Zero!,"This boook is okey. Mr Whitcomb tell his story on how he got into FBI-HRT and what missions he have done. The book is ""average"" but don't be put off for that. One section is really interested when he explains (interrogation)how the ""car salesman break down"" people, but it could be littlebit longer on that subject."
2,Disappointing,"A disappointment after making promises to be a first-person account of thrilling FBI sniper missions. The first half of the book was just about engaging with its descriptions of the tough training required to make it to FBI's elite units. After that, the missions Whitcomb described were just plain dull and dreary. His philosophical musings make for more entertaining reading than his missions and it wasn't supposed to be that way. I am sure there are better books of this sort out there and I am going to find them. Whitcomb has written more books after this one but I am not interested."
3,Very Insightful,"Although a bit eccentric, this is a must read for all of you out there who want a new perspective on life. Still very interesting even if you just want a good read. I couldn't put it down the first time I read it. Some comments are a bit off-the-wall, but all in all a very good book."
4,Good,"Service was great. Fast. Book is okay. Not for the more advanced student of writing. Book has some decent ideas, nothing special."
2,Disappointed in Ms. Myss' latest offering,"I bought two sets of these cards - one for myself and one for a Valentine's Day gift for a friend. After I opened mine, I am thinking of returning the second set.Although the card illustrations are beautiful, I don't find the ""wisdom"" offered in the text to be all that inspiring - certainly not up to the enlightening information in Ms. Myss' books! Also, the accompanying booklet has numbered discussions of each of the 50 cards, yet no numbers appear on the cards which makes it difficult to find the text that corresponds to your chosen card.I also found the discussions to be rambling and in many ways hard to even associate with the original quotation!All in all, I would say if you are looking for daily inspirational readings, others offer better words for daily guidance."
2,could have done without them,I like her books a lot but very disappointed in these cards. Not much info on them. The picures are beautiful.
4,John Powell Does It Again!,"One of the first things that hit me when watching this movie was how much I liked the score. John Powell visits his trademark spy music territory in the vein of Face/Off and The Italian Job with Paycheck and the result is a very satisfying listeing experience. Those who enjoyed the score for the Italian Job will find a lot to like about this score. The highlights for me include tracks 1,2, 7 & 8.Powell incoporates frenzied string writing with piano and drum loops to createan exciting fun thrill ride of a score. A great popcorn score to go with an average popcorn movie. Definitely recommended."
4,Very Distinctive,"If you like soundtracks, I highly recommend this one, or any soundtrack composed by John Powell. His style is very distinctive.If I was in charge at MGM James Bond, I'd sack the current Bond composer David Arnold, right away and put Powell in Arnold's place. The man is terrific. Buy his stuff people :)"
5,Excellent ACTION!,"The music from this soundtrack were superb, as with all John Powell work. Them music fit very well! I enjoyed every track on this CD. Each one was unique but matched. The music, played in order, tell a story them selfs. The two hog chase tracks I especially enjoyed."
3,not for students,"I had to read this for school and although its a pretty good book, most high schoolers seriously wouldn't like it. it's informative but not really for pleasure reading"
5,Get into the water to discover what the underwater demolition teams do during conflict & war!,"This is another outstanding story from the Landmark Series by Random House. You will learn about the very first soldiers to enter the water during World War II in defense of freedom, and follow the Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) around the globe. You will travel to the European theatre, the Pacific battles and back to the US training centers.It's a great read which my boys 9 and 11 really enjoyed! They kept asking for ""one more chapter"" which is what the homeschooling consultant Carole Joy Seid states is the proof of a great book. I agree!Thank you Landmark Books! We collect the original hardcovers & this is a keeper."
2,He's no Scott Turow,"This book was a disappointment. I've only been a law student for a month, and most of what he said I've already learned. I think it'd be good for outsiders to understand what goes on, but most law students should already know that the big firms are slavedrivers. ""Double Billing"" is a much better, much more readable book dealing with the same topic. Keates is an intellectual, and at times he does a good job teaching (even if his audience should already be aware of the facts) and at times he does a good job writing, but he doesn't seem to be able to combine the two. The book gets dull. I would have to recommend ""One L"" or ""Double Billing"" for people interested in the same topic."
4,Entertaining and Informative,"Having practiced law for several years, the material in this book rang true. Many of the insights in this book will come as little surprise to new attorneys or law students, but overall, this book should be given points for style. It packs a lot of information into a couple hundred concise pages. . ."
3,"OK - but if you WANT to be a lawyer, see Keith Evans book","An excellent book for lawyers who WANT to be lawyers and effective advocates is ""Common Sense Rules of Advocacy for Lawyers,"" by Keith Evans.

1,Well made,"This radio has a very good rich sound for such a small speaker. The 1 bulb LED flashlight is brighter than I thought it would be. The rubberized case is solid and durable. Two minutes of cranking has consistently provided 45 minutes of play time at average volume. There are 3 big drawbacks. 1. The tuning knob is very small and next to impossible to read. 2. The crank handle is the smallest I've seen and feels like it will break easily. 3. The worst feature is the on/off switch for the flashlight. It is a ""push"" round button mounted on the side that keeps turning itself on when you hold the radio or pick it up. They should have used a ""slide"" switch and put it in a different area."
1,Bad design-Don't get burned,"I got this wind up Radio & Light because we had a 12 hour blackout here in San Diego and I wanted a radio I could listen to in future emergencies. This thing was very hard to crank. I tried to crank it for 4 minutes and never got any power for light or radio. Then I tried cranking it again and the fold out handle broke. I never got it cranked enough to get any power. Bad design, fragile handle and very hard to crank. Not surprised the handle broke."
4,Good.....Not Great,This is a good compilation but the completeness comes at a price....very small print and bulky book....fine for quick reference and short periods of reading
2,Trinket.... well maybe,I have read a lot of d/s novels and this one is just ok. The writing is bearable but some of the plot left a lot to be desired and to be believed. No it's not the sex scenes it's the main characters actions which start to seem really goofy given her earlier actions. Not delicious and just a little too much spanking for my taste.
1,"This video is not about Diana, but all the Royals.","This video is titled ""Story of Princess Di: Look Behind the Closed Doors"" but when you play the tape it is in fact called ""The Fall of the House of Windsor."" It is a tape about all members of the Royal Family and not just Diana. It also consists mainly of interviews with journalists and embarrassingly bad re-enactment scenes with actors portraying members of the Royal Family. It is also exactly the same tape as another one listed called ""The Story of Princess Di"" which sells for $5.97. Beware - if you order both tapes, you'll get two copies of the same tape at two different prices. I don't recommend either tape - they're cheaply done and have that distinct Royal Family as ""Dynasty"" angle used in the 1980s. END"
2,whose virtues?,"This transformed dissertation on Aristotle, by a long-practiced philosopher who has spent much of his life working with people with different handicaps had the potential to clarify Aristotle's valorization of happiness and at the same time show how happiness as an end in itself holds for every human being. The writing is clear and the examples drawn from contemporary life are particularly vibrant, but this book is not all about Aristotle. It seems to me that the author's vision has been informed more by his spiritual position than by his wrangling with Aristotle. The author is benevolent (benevolent, whose etymolgy is erroneously revealed in these pages) but he writes with the intent of applying Aristotle as a salve for the modern problems he finds most disastrous. Vanier writes best about Aristotle on the topics of desire and friendship. The rest of the book appears a conflation of many ideologies, with Aristole the minimum ingredient."
5,RipDrive 20G by PoGoproducts.com,"I love it, highly recommended. The battery is very powerful, the features are great and easy to use. The only downside is that it doesn't play protected audio files downloaded from pay services like musicmatch (WMA files with DRM).I think this is better than the Ipods, why? PRICE!--20G!!. I bought my Ripdrive from Amazon and I paid less than $300, Cool!.PoGo IT Support (and Customer Service) is great. I am sure you will love this powerful digital auido player."
5,Great review for the VTNE!,I am taking a class that reviews the items that are on the Veterinary Technician National and State Examinations and this is the textbook we use for the class. It has everything you will need to pass the exams to become certified and/or registered!
4,book came here fine,it didnt help me pass or have the disc with it i needed the 3rd edition but the book was in great shape and got here quickly
3,Useful but design could be better,"I use this for my baby's spoons and bottle caps and nipples. The grid does not cover the corners - allowing the spoons or other small things to slip out, so I just have to make sure I put something on both sides of the basket in the dishwasher before I run the dishes. This basket has two sides to it - a top and a bottom. One side is deeper than the other. The deeper side has dividers in it, but I am still able to fit up to 8 baby bottle caps in that side. I can fit a few more in the shallower side with 5 baby spoons."
4,bottle dishwasher container,These were bought for convinence of wash the nipples and other bottle parts. Great product!
1,"The only mystery is how this film isn't in the $5 bin at Wal mart, and it's one not worth solving","Not even the likes of Wes CravenCould save this film from bad movie haven""Cursed"" and ""Shocker""- those were awfulBut this one's so bad, it should be unlawfulIt amazes me how people could be suckered inBy a movie that should be in the bargain binEven the 3D, with picture so flatWill make you say ""enough of THAT""The mystery surrounding a small town killeris what is the plot of this cringe-worthy thrillerAnd especially the characters, which we've seen beforeAdd to this movie being a flat out boreThe dialogue is awful, the acting just sucksYou'll await the end of this waste of hard-earned bucksAnd even the twist, which is just a guessing gameIs predictable as hell, and flat out lameBoring, depressing, unworthy and dullYou'd be better off staring at the nearest wallLet's hope Wes can improve with Scream 4Which hopefully will be good and not such a bore"
1,Unbelievably bad,"Please, don't waste your money. This movie was so bad on so many different levels. I love scary movies, this was not scary and not in the least bit entertaining either. Confusing, hard to maintain interest. The premise of the plot was good, but so horribly executed. The acting was also very bad. If I could have given it NO stars I would, but the lowest possible rating was one star."
2,Wes Craven what were you thinking?,The movie was not quite what I was hoping but for the cheap price that I got it for I can't complain much so if you can get it for less than $5 get it just because it is Wes Craven...
2,Craven's worst film.,"And I've seen ""Vampire in Brooklyn"" and ""Cursed."" This film, however, is humorless and dull. I wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. I knew I was in trouble when my brain shut down during the many conversation scenes between the main character and his best friend. And the finale was all over the place, with characters popping up one after another and tying up plot holes with forced dialogue. I felt like I was watching a spoof of a whodunit."
5,Total Teen Movie,"This was a well made movie with some thrills and chills. There are quite a few funny parts and some that make you wonder what happen. It was somewhat predictable for me... but kept my teen guessing until the end. We rented it, but after watching it, my teen has requested we buy it. I will. I enjoyed the movie also. There is not a lot of graphic gore. NO sex scenes (a plus), but a lot of sex talk... nothing teens have not already heard on TV or at school. Good flick."
4,Really good...for the first 20 minutes,"This movie was really good for the first 20 minutes and it had us completely hooked in and scared. After that it started to go a little down hill and got kind of silly in parts, but overall it was still a good movie. I think what kept it from being great is they didn't keep up the momentum created in the first 20 minutes and also the acting wasn't top notch by a few of the characters. This had the potential to be a truly scary movie and I wish it would have kept that feeling from the first 20 minutes up. I still enjoyed the movie rental."
1,my soul to take,"this movie was awful, if you have A.D.D. then maybe you'll luv it but other than that, you think you are getting a thriller with some scary moments but in fact you are getting part comedy and half crazy. don't buy this, it was a waste of 20.00 dollars!"
1,OMG,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER... THAT'S ALL IM SAYING. WAKE ME WHEN IT'S OVER. THE MOVIE INDUSTRY HAS FALLEN TO HELL. THIS MOVIE WAS JUST SOMETHING TO MAKE SOME MONEY. SAW IT WHEN IT CAME ON CABLE. LOL AND NOW THE MOVIE INDUSTRY IS MAKING REMAKES OF REMAKES AND REMAKES OF THE REMAKES THEY JUST MADE! GO FIGURE...
1,Why Wes Craven? Why?,What a mess of a horror flick. Nothing makes sense in this and the violence felt very tame. Avoid this one and you'll thank yourself in the end.
2,Incoherent Mess,"Wes Craven has always been the type of director who makes genre classics (A Nightmare On Elm Street Scream) or genre dogs (The Hills Have Eyes Part 2, Cursed). When it comes to his films no middle ground seems too exist whatsoever. My Soul To Take falls under the category of dog. This film is a watered down slasher movie with supernatual overtones. No suspense, no gore, a confused plot and hideous performances."
4,Good Movie,This was a really good movie Wes Craven did it again!! And this movie has a pretty good twist which you do not see coming. The movie also has a pretty good cast .
2,Did not deliver scary,"I expected to really be scared, or in suspense with this movie, but I didn't find that, it dragged a little, it was different, but the only real suspense is finding out who really was doing all of the killing not a real shocker once you find out. An okay movie that probably will not get watched twice."
4,not bad,I thought this was a pretty good movie but not great. Scary movies just aren't very scary anymore. The story was good but I felt it lacked something.
1,Don't Even Bother!!!,I went to see Scream 4 this weekend just gone and just loved it. The Scream movies were the start of my love for horror films and Wes Craven. When I got home after seeing Scream 4 I decided to keep to the Craven theme and chucked My Soul To Take in. I watched the whole thing and wished I didnt even bother. Especially after watching Scream 4 it doesnt even come close in comparison and I cannot believe it is even a Wes Craven movie. Go see Scream - it is brilliant. My Soul To Take is NOT!!
5,Strong Hearted Album,"This album ""Strong Heart"" from Patty Loveless is just another album in the lines of classic songs on classic albums. The first single ""That's The Kind Of Mood I'm In"" really started this album off right with just the right amount of energy(how it only hit #13 is beyond me). The latest single ""Last Thing On My Mind"" showcases Patty's voice very well, and hopefully will return her to top 10 status where she belong, those are just two example of how good this album is, the song that I really like on this album is the title cut ""Strong Heart"" the opening to the song is just so relaxing to listen to, and the song is so soothing to listen to that you just might forget the it's country, just another example of great artistry from a great artist."
5,Patty.....You're So Cool!!!!,"This underrated gem ranks with Patty's best work! Patty is always excellent and this is why she will always remain an ""evergreen"". She is the only country singer who can take a 60's type song like ""You're So Cool"" and make it listenable and before you know it you're singing right along with it!! Reba, Faith, Martina, Shania, Carrie Underwood, Gretchen Wilson and all the rest of those ""fake country singers"" are not fit to fill Patty Loveless's shoes. This project is often overlooked but it really is fantastic!!"
4,"Strong Effort for ""Strong Heart""","While definitely not up to the standard set by ""Long Stretch of Lonesome"", this is a strong album that no doubt will grow on the listener. Outstanding production values by Emory Gordy, Jr. The musicians are a veritable ""who's who"" in Nashville. Definitely worth adding to your collection. The lady can flat out sing and her range and willingness to stretch her talents and choice of material is impressive."
3,Pop goes the Country Traditionalist,"I just purchased the new Patty Loveless cd, and the most arresting thing that I can say about it is that it is different. Now, mind you, it's not a bad record by a longshot, but it definately takes its cue moreso from the current landscape of pop in Nashville than the country-rock leanings that are prevalent in her prior albums. The first track, ""You're So Cool"" is a prime example. It is very much in the vein of Martina Mcbride's ""I Love You"" and Faith Hill's ""This Kiss"", both good POP songs. Throughout the album, lush strings and arrangements frame what is by far I think the closest thing we will see to a pop album from this artist. Again, it's a good record, and I hope it gets better airplay than ""Long Stretch Of Lonesome"" did, but overall it is not her best."
3,Good book for the money,"This book, though growing whiskers, still has plenty of useful ideas. There is a lot of room for new ideas and new ventures in the video business and this book will help you explore them.As for one of the negative reviews which stated, ""According to this book any one can go out with their cheap $300 camera and make professional video, WRONG!""..not so fast. First, some of the cheapie cameras in the Sony line are actually pretty good. If you're shooting with lots of good light and especially if you're shooting for display on a website, there is no reason you couldn't start off with one of these cameras. Also, many wedding and event videographers are upgrading to hi-def and putting their standard equipment up for sale on places like Craigslist and ebay, so there are deals on professional (prosumer) cameras out there between $1000 and $1500."
5,This Book is a Lifesaver!,"Before I bought this book, I was a security guard for 10 years in an affluent Chicago suburb. As you can imagine, this wasn't exactly my dream job, so I searched around and found this great book. After pouring over it for a whole day, I decided to take it's advice. One year later I run my own property insurance video business, and I couldn't be happier. I particularly enjoyed the extensive information on marketing. The best part is that some of my old clients as a security guard are now clients of my new business. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a dream of working for themselves as a videographer."
4,Aboringinal Education,"This is a great story for comparing all the ""Cinderella"" cultures in the world. It also leads to a wonderful teaching unit on Aboringinal customs and their way of life.Used extensively in primary grades."
2,The Courtesan's Daughter,"The Courtesan's Daughter isn't such a good book. When I first picked it up, I thought it would be more, well, interesting. The beginning was exciting enough, it started with a kidnapping. Then the main character, Phano, meets her true love, Theo. But she cannot marry him because rumor is that she is a slave's daughter, and a slave cannot marry a citezen of Athens. Her mother's greatest enemy, Phrynion, has not only spread vicious lies about her, but threatens to attack her and betrays Athens. In the end, this heroine must find her strength in the gods."
4,A mix of techhouse and influences of electro,"I can understand that many Swayzak fans listen to this cd with disappointment. This cd is way much harder and minimal then there previous releases ""Snowbording In Argentina"" and ""Himawari""But remember that this is not Swayzak, this is a mixed compilation by them.I think they do it pretty good though. They've mixed a nice compilation of deep techhouse and very minimal tracks. Even influences of electro, dub and 80's synthpop can be heard in some songs.If you like releases by record labels like Chain Reaction and Gigolo Records this is something for you."
2,"Self-contradictory, pretentious garbage!!!","The puffed-up narrator, the detestable Claudia Hampton, states an intriguing aim of providing a ""kaleidoscopic"" view of history. I read on, enthralled at this radical prospect. Imagine my disgust when I discover that she singularly fails to do anything of the sort, initially flitting cleverly between tenses and narrative positions, but spending the final half of the book doing the very thing she intended to avoid - chronology. And a very banal, dry, narrative chronology it is too. Awful."
2,Never became engaged,"Unfortunately, try as I might, I could never connect with any character in this bood. Ultimately I never cared enough about any character to even make it through to the end."
4,great book,"This was an excellent book but I thought the writing was a little self-conscious. The narrator kept explaining, ""I am writing a history of my life,"" ""I am writing about different periods of my life and splicing them together into one narrative,"" ""I am interested in history,"" etc. Aside from this flaw, the book was very entertaining and an excellent character study. The narrator, Claudia, is feisty and memorable; she is a colorful, competitive person. Her usual toughness and snide sense of humor makes the core of the book -- an affair that drew her deepest emotions to the surface and made her vulnerable --even more striking."
4,"under-read, under-appreciated","here in the states, few people seem familiar with lively's work, which is a shame. those of us here who like annie proulx and lorrie moore should know about her, but often don't. lively's got a lot more bite than pym and more daring than brookner, but her subject matter is refreshingly ""english."" despite it's mawkish title, i recommend moon tiger."
4,The World According to Claudia,"On her deathbed, Claudia Hampton decides to write ""the history of the world"" from her own quirky and selective point of view, stirring fact, fiction, myth, and dreams into an eclectic stew. Without a clear chronology, there are points of confusion as Claudia moves through time and space in the retelling of her life, but who can fail to admire this woman as she bares her soul, admits her flaws and foibles, her private and public sins and loves?"
3,dissapointed,"Very well written. Her use of language is superb. Her range of subjects, from incest,to women's rights is too broad."
4,doctor in the house?,"Put it this way: this book had me seriously considering cancelling my next check up with the doctor. If half of this story is based on reality ... oh boy. A great book to read, with characters that sound all-too-real!@"
3,Disappointing,"Definitely not a 5 star read. Plods for the first 300 pages, then picks up the pace a bit. Far too much detail about the characters' clothing. Perhaps the repetitive brand-label name dropping is meant to convey the materialism of the characters, but it felt like product placement to me."
1,can't get it right,This is not a picture of what I got. Three times you sent me the cables with two male ends. You cannot extend this cable with two male ends. The picture clearly shows one male end and one female end. I had to spend an extra $20 at another site to buy an adapter to make these work. I am very displeased with Amazon.com and will probably never use it again.Lee Burgin
4,Crushing Hardcore,"Not to be mistaken for the drummer from Lynryd Skynrd (the reviews above make me laugh), Artimus Pyle was a thrash/crust/hardcore band hailing from San Fransisco. Think of His Hero is Gone, with more of a thrashy touch to them. The music is brutal, unrelenting, and punishing. Hardcore fans will enjoy this thoroughly, people looking for a classic rock album will not. Also check out: His Hero is Gone, Scholastic Deth, Severed Head of State, Corrosion of Conformity"
2,This is not what you think it is,"Typically, one associates the name of Artimus Pyle with the legendary Lynyrd Skynyrd. The band here, Artimus Pyle, have nothing to do with Skynyrd, never have, never will. Skynyrd's drummer of the same name, Artimus Pyle, is involved in a band called The Artimus Pyle Band, or APB. This is decpetive marketing on part of the band selling their product here. As for the album, it's hardcore punk, not classic rock. Please do not blame the real Artimus for things done in his name."
1,Don't Bother,This is one of the worst cd's i've heard. Just abunch of noise. If your looking for the old Lynyrd Skynyrd sound don't buy this one.
4,Good product,Fits well - true to size and product arrived on time. Wish they made a similar product with thinner material.
1,"Less cotton, less comfortable; Danskin mistake",In the past found this Danskin bra -- both straight strap design and high percent (90 or so) cotton material --comfortable for all activities. Lycra or polyester now almost half of the content and the comfort and absorbency are gone. This was a superior product. Now ruined by cheap downgrade in manufacturing process. Big disappointment to find it scratchy instead of getting high quality cotton.
5,i cant belive you people! this game rocks!,"look, when i got this game for playstation2 i couldent stop playing it!i played for a week stright and i think it's awsome! maby the graphics are a little off but its details are nice. i liked when you were able to desige your own car... they did all look the same but its fun crashing and smashing the cars. i dont really pay attention to the same car design thing much =P. plus theres 4 different shapes... a coup truck musle car and sport car so you do get to change color, put decals, and put like spoilers and differt hoods and everything, rims, and side skirts. anyway i really think this game is awsome. buy it, you wont regreat it."
2,Not Magenta,"This paper is NOT magenta. It is downright PURPLE! Not AT ALL the color I was looking for. Also the paper was not the soft ""construction paper"" texture I expected, but I leave that as my fault."
4,A Book in Good Condition,"The Book was in good condition, and as expected. I am most satisfied with the speed and the service. All was done very well."
5,"The most succinct, detailed physical summary I've seen","Simple maps, Every possible denomination of manmade site to visit from castles to prehistoric sites to bridges. roads could be more detailed, driving times would be nice, no typical ""touristy"" info on where to eat, drink, sleep, etc. I wish the sections were all in one book. Recommended for people visiting Scotland that aren't there to party or shop. Chapters include: history of region, several excursions( tour routes), towns, industrial monuments and harbours, communications, rural buildings, mansions and memorials, artillery forts and barracks, castles, ecclesiastical monuments, dark age carved stones, forts, brochs and settlements, cairns and standing stones. lots of pics."
5,"Overall, a good read.","I thought this book had everything going for it, and not much lacking. There was a handsome hero, beautiful heroine, lots of adventure, and lots of funny scenes. I liked that the hero and heroine didn't fight throughout the whole book like most romance novels. My favorite scenes were the beginning with the bull, and the love triangle between Matt, Caroline, and Daniel. If you want a book that will not leave you bored, and will provide plenty of romance and plot, this is your book. The only thing I have to complain about is the ending. It was very rushed and leaved the reader wanting more closure. I mean, the rest of the book was very thorough and told the story well, but the end just wizzed by and had the reader scratching their head. It went way to fast and seemed like the author was rushing at the end to meet her deadline. But, that aside, the book as a whole was a good one."
2,forgettable,I couldn't believe how much I hated this book. I've read all of Karen Robards historical romance novels and a few of them are some of my all time favorite books. I didn't like Caroline - I found her annoying. I also didn't care for the setting and time period.
4,This Side of Heaven,"The book was good but not as good as a book I had previously read of hers.She has mostly contemporary it seems. I would love to know more titles ofhistorical novels. She was a new writer to me. I love Catherine Anderson,DorothyGarlock, Linda Lael Miller, etc."
2,Ugh...,Not very good. I did finish it but not good.The heroin is lame. She has these childish tantrums all the time. It's so annoying. I'd not advise it for anyone. Just not good
1,degrading and abusive,"I couldn't enjoy this book because the heroine got treated like crap the whole book by everyone because of the sins her sister committed. Even at the end of the book, they were all still treating her like crap. And none of the people who hurt her ever got their comeuppance."
3,Rather odd interface,It probably works well if you have the proper interface. It has a plug with 4 pin holes over 5. I didn't have such an interface on my motherboard (Dell Dimension 8300)and couldn't find a USB expansion card that did so I returned it to Amazon.I wound replacing my floppy drive with an Ultra combination floppy and media drive(link below) and a USB expansion card with a 4 pin interfce because DEll omitted to provide a 4 pin USB interface on my motherboardInternal Media Drive Black.
4,User of outdated technology!,"My hubby & I still use our vcr's everyday and we need reliable video tapes. Maxwell has been a steady product. We're looking at dvr technology, but we get more on our tapes & my hubby doesn't get as annoyed with them. Long live the vcr."
1,Did I buy new and get used?,All 8 tapes were opened. Usually they come individually wrapped. So far one of them is defective and could not be used.
2,good for one recording only,tapes will only let you record once. if you try recording over them the picture becomes distorted and unviewable. happened with all 8 tapes.
4,Maxcell VHS T-120 vidieo tapes.,"Maxcell tapes where delivered in perfect condition. However the picture of the product online did not match the picture on the box. It does however still use the same bar code. I was hoping to get the older version of the product since I had used that version for many years and was extremly satisfied with the product. A recent box cover design change made me wonder if the materials changed in the production of the item. I normally get these tapes at Boscov's but they did not carry them anymore. I looked on Amazon and found the old version box style. However, I recieved the newer changed version. NO APPARENT DIFFRENCES IN QUALITY HAVE BEEN NOTICED YET. Time will tell. I decided not to return them since I planned on buying some of these anyway. Only not as many."
2,Clicks and pops during recording,Don't buy these tapes. I'll have to throw them away. This standard grade must not be any good. Next time I will order a better grade.
3,Expensive for the quality,"I purchased three - two as gifts and one for myself. One of the pots arrived with a chipped top and after only two or three uses, I am noticing a hairline crack deepening on the lid. I am disappointed in the quality and have low expectations for how many more uses it can withstand - even with kid-glove handling."
5,Retirement Clock a Hit!,Turned out to be the perfect gift for my friend who just turned 50 and is counting her days to retirement..............Easy to set... fun to watch.....
5,Brilliant!,"I agree very much with the first reviewer of this CD. I was fortunate to hear Belkin play the Sibelius Violin Concerto in Sydney and he brings the same absolute dedication, enthusiasm, energy and technicial virtuosity to this CD (and his others). The generous Allegro Moderato of the first movement of the Tchaikovsky is matched by the breathless and magical speed of the closing Allegro vivacissimo. Brilliant! I believe Belkin to be the equal of David Oistrakh. The Shostakovich is also a peerless performance with the highlight Belkin's dramatic and moving cadenza in the slow movement, climaxing with the stringed ""pronouncement"" of Shostakovich's signature theme: D,EFlat,C,B."
3,Fun movie,"It is a fun rock movie for chicks! Nothing special, nothing horrible. Gina Gershon and Drea DeMateo are both not hard on the eyes!"
2,Low budget...,"This movie is a below average movie. You can tell that the budget was limited for this movie. Don't get me wrong, Gina Gershon does a good acting job, but some of the others actors just don't pull it off. The best thing about this movie is that it shows how unglamorous being in a band can be, and what hard work it is.It's too bad that this movie had such a limited budget. Gina does an OK job in singing, but the movie is titled incorrectly. The band that this is about is a punk band, not a rock & roll band. So, the title is very misleading. Punk and Rock & Roll are not the same genre, so it should have been titled ""Prey for Punk"".Gina is a good singer when she sings slower melodies, but she doesn't know how to sing punk or rock & roll.She is incredibly attractive though. So, if you just want to see her looking hot, then buy this. If you want a good quality film, skip this one."
2,'prey' for the end of this movie,"The opposite of love is not hate, it's apathy and that's how I feel about this movie. It's not great, but it's not terrible, it's just so...mediocre. Gina Gershon's Jacki is not a has-been because, at 40, she never was. The rest of her band is equally as flat and why was 3/4 of the band gay? An honest bore"
2,perdictable story with not much here but these chicks rock the house,"Let's here it for female rock chicks man, they rock the hizouse but the movie is really perdictable and it's safe to say that Gina Gershon (Bound, Driven) has really dug herself out of a hole from Showgirls and Driven and what a performance she gives in here. Marc Blucas (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Wes Craven Presents THEY) has a decent role as the brother named Animal of the drummer of the band, played by Shelly Cole. Drea DeMatteo (The Sopranos, Tv's Joey) plays the bassist of the band who has a alcohol problem and also a rapist boyfriend. Also starring Lori Petty (In The Army Now, Tank Girl) as the lead guitarist of the chick rock band."
4,Darn good,"I really liked this movie. I thought the acting by the four lead women was tops, the music very good, and the atmosphere was gritty and authentic. There were so many honest moments, written with insight and humor. I almost loved it.The problem came when just one too many tragedies occurred. It was like, rape, drug addiction, rape, car accident... geez, what next? If they hadn't messed with the character of Faith, I would have been with this movie completely, but they lost me there. Still, 7/8 of a great movie is still pretty great. If you like rock movies, or tough chick movies, then definitely check this film out!"
2,"""Prey"" for another movie......","I only got this one because Gina Gershon was in it. It was okay, I have only watched it ONCE since I purchased it back in '04... if that doesn't tell ya something I don't know what will.I wouldn't recommend this, you'd be better off to get the movie BOUND instead."
4,A must read !,"An important work that sheds light and understanding of the struggles and triumphs of Afrocubans and their culture. Robin D. Moore takes you into a fascinating journey, with scholarly research and in depth analysis, of the racial experience during a period of tremendous changes and unrest in Cuba. This work is an enormous contribution to our understanding of this period between 1920 through 1940...Bravo!"
5,Perfection for fans of Post-Punk,"Kleenex/LiLiPUT has been a favorite band of mine since I first heard ""Ain't You"" in 1978, but I lost track of them after 1980's Split/Die Matrosen. This CD compilation fills in all the gaps. It is a joy from start to finish. CD 1 contains all the old favorites and some less familiar songs. It's all spare, quirky, driving post-punk fun and will likely be the favorite of people who remember them from that time. CD 2 is a revelation and is fast becoming my favorite part of the album. LiLiPUT's later songs have them exploring no-wave and funk territory that sounds so New York. I had no idea. At turns they resemble the Velvet Underground meets DNA, the Bush Tetras meet the Contortions, Y-Pants meets Teenage Jesus and the Jerks. But always they are uniquely LiLiPUT. Their music still sounds fresh 25 years later. I am more a fan than ever. These two discs are essential for post-punk fans."
5,a lot of performance wraped in a small package,"just got my MuVo NX 256 MB MP3 player today and i could not be happier with it. the software loaded easily, plugged it in, starting uploading songs immediately, and within minutes i was listening to music. now if yer looking to get music quality you might hear from a CD on yer stereo at home or in your car, yer expectations are a bit much, but i think the sound is great! it weighs next to nothing, so working out with the armband shud not be a problem. if you are looking for a moderately sized MP3 player (holds about 55 songs), the MuVo is solid."
2,worked well while it worked,"I thought this was the best thing ever. I loved the capabilities to carry data at the same time as music. I loved being able to run with it (with no skipping or problems at all) and it was easy to transfer.I don't like how the songs play in alphabetical order. and MOST OF ALL- i hate the fact that they only have a 90 day warranty! Mine stopped being recognized by computers a month ago, and creative labs (terrible cust. service by the way) is telling me i have to pay 40 bucks to get it fixed. I really have a hard time trusting in these products when creative labs themselves can't trust the products they make enough to give them at least a 1 yr warranty. I suggest not taking the risk on this one... and just spend a bit more money and get something w/a better warranty and something that's better -- Ipod."
4,Great little doohickey,"Well, got this for my birthday to work out with. I wanted a nice and small unit for jogging, that would hold at least an hour's worth of songs and work in Linux.Since I use Linux 100% of this time, this is great, because it just works! I have usb and mass-storage compiled in my 2.6.8 kernel and can mount the drive (it uses fat16). The file names get truncated to 8.3 dos format when you copy them to the device. Also it doesn't like spaces in the file names.My only compaint is that the ear buds are a little large and get uncomfortable after about 20-30 minutes.It takes about 5-7 minutes to fill the device from 0 to 256mbs. I kinda wish I had gotten the USB2.0 version, but I can't complain, it was a gift."
3,overpriced for a lack of features.,"while creative has a hit on their hands with their latest Muvo solid-state MP3 line, there is absolutely NO reason to choose the Muvo NX 256MB player over the Muvo TX FM 256MB player.The NX is more expensive, utilizes USB 1.1 to transfer files and lacks a radio/radio recording.The TX FM is CHEAPER for the same memory size/usb stick configuration, utilizes USB 2.0 for MUCH faster speeds AND HAS FM RADIO INCLUDED AS WELL. seriously, the NX right now is a ripoff until the price drops the TX to match.[...]"
4,Love it,Ok guys or girls this will be a totaly honest review. I own an apple ipod also it is great for listening at home long trips and for its large amount of storage but sucks for working out and sports. So everything has its place .I just got my 256meg movo nx. It rocks its light comes with 2 battery mods in colors blue and gray and dosent skip like the ipod can. The movo is easy to set up and use. And sounds great. The included earbud while not great are not as bad as other reviews I have read. Here are the downsides or at least what i would improve in a perfect world I would like to see an fm tuner even though they suck for small devices like this I would like to be able to plug it in to recharge the battery ( a normal battery will give you a good 6-7 hours listening time so you might want to get some rechargable batterys) All in all i would highly recommend this product.
3,not bad,it was a great little mp3 player back in college. stored a decent amount of music to get you through the day (3-4 albums). its really light and the controls are intuitive.
1,Are you KIDDING me?,I couldn't believe when I saw this. What an antique! 256 MEGA-BYTES! for $147! I can get 16 GIGA-BYTES for the same price that's 64 times the space. How about the SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB Video MP3 Player (sold on Amazon)for $119 and it plays videos and has an FM radio too. Come on Amazon take this ancient piece of carp off your inventory or sell it for what it's worth (about 50 cents)SanDisk Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)
1,Terrible Company,"Bought this and just after a month the volume up button stopped working. Sent it back to manufacturer (Creative Labs) for repair/replacement and they refused to honor the warranty, claiming ""misuse""! This is nonsense. all I did was use it while walking, jogging, etc. The buttons are cheaply made and flimsy, but their policy is even more outrageous. A total ripoff!"
4,good mp3,"this is a great little player, i would have given it 5 stars but the head phones the give u is crap!!!!. The head phones lasted me 3 week and the broke(one side stoped working)."
4,Good Product,"I really like my MP3 player, it is small and comes with an arm band so I can work-out with it. My only complaint is that the battery compartment is a bit flimsy and the cover comes off all the time."
4,"Good quality, and even plays mp3 at 320kbps!","I was eyeing an ipod but had to obe content with my next best 'budget' bet - this muvo nx 256. It is great. Holds all my favourite music. I dont plan to make a trip so long as to require 10,000 songs, so the storage is just fine. The output frequency is 20 to 20,000 so the stereo quality is very good, and the supplied headphones do a good job. its quite user friendly and light. I was not expecting the 2nd battery pack in a new colour, so that was a surprise for me too.I had a problem whie seeking an mp3 at 320 kbps...but then i upgraded my firmware from 1.01.07 to 1.30.09...and the problem was solved! :) So am quite content.I plan to buy rechargable batteries tomorrow.The voice recorder is also very effective. Put it on a table, and it records everybody around it...so quite senstive. Good if u wish to record a lecture or an interview :).Recommended."
1,MY GRADE: D minus to D.,"Needlessly confusing and characters I didn't care about so the DVD was shredded after the first fifteen minutes. Next time have a better opening, movie creators. That is all.Rotten Tomatoes gave this film a low rating. Maybe you should, too.Based on a roleplaying game of the same name.The budget for this film was a bit over $25M and it made a bit over $2M at the Box Office. The prosecution rests its case.OVERALL GRADE: D minus to D; WHEN WATCHED: April 2012."
4,Better than expected,"Certainly, it's low-budget sci-fi.But for low-budget sci-fi, it's actually quite good. The characters are portrayed with depth, sensitivity, and individuality (much more so than the expected cardboard-cutout-characters typical for low-budget sci-fi); the background is well-developed and intriguing; and the story is interesting, without the major plot holes again typical for the genre.Viewers might want to know this is a ""zombie apocalypse""-style movie, with considerable reasonably realistic violence and gore.The DVD packaging is somewhat sub-par. Although Spanish subtitles are provided, English and French subtitles are notably missing, very unusual for a Region 1 DVD, and therefore quite difficult for Canadian francophones and American hard-of-hearing viewers to understand."
2,Bad name for scifi.,"I am an avid science fiction fan but I found this movie to be boring and predictable. Supposedly set in the future, I found it totally implausible to be shoveling coal into an inter-planetary spaceship.But that was the least of this movie's problems; the plot was as vague as the cinematography. The scenes were dark and confusing. The dark battle scene at the beginning of the movie was reminiscent of WWI but the movie was supposedly set in the future, and then suddenly it turned into a slasher movie with mutants possessing lobster claws ripping soldiers apart in a blood fest of gore.This is the kind of movie that gives scifi a bad reputation. It was hard to understand what was happening and why. The exposition was vague, the characterization was awful, and the plot was hard to follow. Save your money on this one, don't buy it. L.W."
1,Waste of time,"I had such high hopes for this movie since it had some steam-ish elements in the trailer. Well, it relies on the same old good versus evil gimmicks, science vs religion, corporate heads exploit the workers, rich people screw the poor, blah blah blah. There were times where it was visually interesting, but it really fell flat. Dull script, flat characters, no real plot, even the actors couldn't save this. Only if you are ridiculously bored should you bother watching this."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I can't believe that anyone gave this more than 2 stars. I was hopeful when I saw the cast, but the people who say the CGI was good and the acting was good...I cried a little that I lost 2 hours of my life. The story doesn't even make sense. The mutants take humans to the machine to be changed, and from what the movie shows, it takes a long time to get someone down to the machine. So the fact there is this rampant mutant outbreak in like five minutes or even days is ridiculous. It might be the only movie I have ever told someone to completely avoid. There really is nothing worth watching in this...except maybe the...nope, nothing!"
3,Solid 3,"Im sure everyone would like to edit this movie in something a bit better,,,is it Ron 's red riding hood cape or that huge amount of cheeze, or maybethe mutants could have used a bit more errie vocals...but all said thisis a pretty good movie that wanted to do it all but could only do somuch due to many factors...We have trench warfare like world war 1&2...we have powerfull coorporationsbent on winning at all price, and we have the newly arrival of the MACHINE.So, it might not be the best,, but they sure tried and came out with thismovie that is worthy of a view.This is a keeper for me."
2,Confusing unclear plot for the uninitiated,"First time I watched this blu-ray, it felt like I had gotten plopped in mid-movie, or perhaps in the middle episode of a serial TV series. The whole backstory is explained very poorly, and it took till halfway through the movie to understand key plot elements. In some cases, it took until I watched the extra features before I really understood certain elements. I get the feeling the writers assumed the viewer would already be a fan of the role-playing game and already understood the basic ""world"" that movie is set in. For uninitiated viewers like myself, much of it was terribly unclear. Also, for me personally at least, I did not enjoy the overly video-game look, particularly dominant in the first part of the movie, where the soldiers and war scenes looked totally fake and CGIed and it felt like you were watching a video game instead of a movie."
3,Quite the melange!,"Steampunk, sci-fi, post-apocalyptic graphic novel, and computer role-playing-game dungeon crawl, all rolled into one.I can't say I've ever seen that combination before.Actually kind of enjoyable if you sit back and don't bother analyzing anything you're watching. Purely escapist fare. Extremely simply story line; no complexity or surprises anywhere (one of the reasons I didn't rate it higher)."
2,Could have been worse,"There is really nothing compelling about this film. While the concept is not terrible - rather deadly, somewhat mutated ""zombies"" overrunning the earth in the far future (2400 or something), across a barely surviving earth, the actual execution leaves much to be desired; not the least the gaping plot holes.Above all, why can't the humans just drop a whole bunch of big bombs, or a nuclear bomb, down the hole with the ""machine""? Or can't they cave in the hole and seal it like the Vikings seem to have done in the year 600 or something?The acting is exaggerated, with dull uninspired characters.So what's good about it? Well, it's not just a zombie movie. And the several times over post apocalyptic world is well done for a lower budget film. On the other hand, there is really no depth or ""insight"" from this film, like 28 days later."
1,Mutant Chronicles,Worst movie I've ever seen. I start to vomit in my mouth when I think I spent money on it
2,Evil Mutant Machine must be destroyed,"We watched this on the SciFi channel because we like some of the actors in it. This is a rather typical post-apocalyptic 'save the world' storyline. The movie starts with steam-punk trench warfare a la World War One; and then the mutants are unleashed. Of course some nice monks have been saving the knowledge of how to defeat evil (think 5th Element) and they gather a band of unlikely heros to destroy the machine that is making the evil mutants. Meanwhile a small portion of the Earth's population flees to colonies on Mars. Lots of predictable fighting transpires as the hero team gets killed off one by one. Then the main hero plugs in what is supposed to be a bomb and activates it, and the evil mutant machine is actually a spaceship that launches. The closing scene shows the ship arcing towards Mars. Poetic justice and all that. A solid B-level movie, very dark, very violent, and pretty boring."
1,Dull,"Layered somewhere under page after page of description that does nothing to advance the story is a boring tale of U.S. vs Soviet biochemists and the usual bloodthirsty military types after the spoils of scientific research. Throw in two completely unlikable braniac little kids on their deathbeads, a token female who is only there to act motherly/act as some booty for the main male character, and not a lot of excitement, Variant proves that not all medical doctors are destined for the best seller list.The science in this book is horribly outdated twenty years after publication, but it wasn't terribly cutting edge for the time it was written. A blurb on the cover compares this book to Robin Cook, and couldn't be farther from the truth. At least Cook puts some mindless action and violence in to pep things up a bit."
2,Side effects problems,"I had problems with constipation, weight gain, and depression. I do think it was helping my memory and ,maybe, if I could have stuck with it a while longer the side effects would have evened themselves out."
5,~~~~~~~~~~~Love it!~~~~~~~~~~,I love this Printer. Had it for many years and it still works great!Never had a printer quite like it!!!! This thing does EVERYTHING!!!
3,Not XP Compatible,"If you don't want to mess with patches and downloads, don't get this unit. It is not compatible with Windows XP. Lexmarks customer service is next to impossible. You have to call long distance for help on this particular all-in-one. The site is impossible to find help on. The IT I spoke to didn't seem to impressed with this unit either, which really made me uneasy."
1,Avoid at all costs,"I purchased the Lexmark X85 with the hopes of getting a good All-In-One printing machine, two days later I returned it and got a good All-In-One Machine in the Lexmark X5150.Just about everything was wrong with the X85. It missaligned everything, unless it was on the exceding slow Max-Photo setting. Even at regular speed it was way too slow. Whenever it printed something it sounded as if it was about to explode. The program it came with was about as user friendly as a SWAT team to a wanted criminal. In fact the only thing that worked on the thing was the scanner that worked very nicely. Otherwise the machine was [...].If you are thinking about purchasing the X85, don't. Spend the extra money towards something better like the X5150, heck even the cheaper X75 is better than the X85. So I guess what I am trying to say is do not get this machine, there are much better ones out there, even for less money."
2,A trouble maker,"I purchased my X85 6 months ago, since then, I got a lot of troubles with this priner. The first time I used it to print a color photo, it came out all pink. called customer service, they send me a new catriage, now the color is still not right, the images are either too blur or two dark. Also the copy does not seem right. sometimes the first couple of black copy came out all black ink, after a few times, it will do copy. the quick mode does not work properly either. And it constantly lose connect with my computer ( I use window XP). Finanlly I got fed up with this printer, and I call customer service again, now they have 1800 or 1888 number for technical support, upon my request, they agree to send me a new model x5150 with a reasonable extra charge. The new X5150 works great with photo printing, now I can send picture to my family and friend printed from my printer. Compared with X5150, X85 is a trouble maker. Would not recommend this, but Lexmark customer service is not bad."
2,Lexmark X-85 Review,"Anyone with experience using MFC would be disappointed with the X-85....Although it is easy to set up, the instruction guide is poorly described, much too brief and not detailed in any way. You will be calling Lexmark immediately. The print functions are jumpy, quality of print is rated (5) in a (1-10) rating. The scanner is adequate for a beginner, but it does not have a sheet feeder for multi copy or multi scan. I returned this machine."
5,THE LAST PRINTER or SCANNER I'LL EVER BUY,"This is my 3rd Lexmark printer in the last 3 years - i've upgraded all my previous printers because of my growing experiences with computers, digital cameras, etc. Every one of my Lexmark printers I've been pleased with the speed, quality and performance - never had a single problem.I started looking at replacing my Z53 when I realized I needed a scanner (and a copier would be nice also). This Lexmark Z85 All-In-One printer had the most and best options (ie - computer doesn't need to be turned on to make copies). this printer is fast, has excellent quality, and has all i'll ever need and more. Also, it's not eating the ink cartridges - I do alot of ""photo"" pictures and the ink levels are hardly being touched - very pleased with how long the cartridges are lasting. The on-screen ink level guides is also nice.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT - WORTH EVERY PENNY!!"
1,Serious problems with this printer,"I've had my X85 for a while and would not recommend it. Although functionality is excellent there are recurring problems getting it to communicate with the PC (I have a Dell Dimension 8250 running XP pro). The drivers out of the box did not work. Installing new drivers + patch fixed most problems but I still have to reboot too frequently. Go to the Dell forum to see all the complaints about this printer (Dell made the mistake of recommending it!). Many, many people have this same set of problems."
2,Box of Junk.,"Nothing but problems, poor tech support and software that is notfriendly. There are many fine multipurpose printers out there, this is NOT one of them."
4,does exactly what it says,"This printer is an excellent machine for less than 200 bucks. I needed a new printer, scanner, and a photocopier and this product meets the bill nicely. I have a small office (just me) and we homeschool our kids. From time to time we need to make copies (in addition to normal printing) and it comes in very handy for that since the copy function does not require me to stop working on the PC. I have the printer networked using peer-to-peer so the entire house can use it and it works great. I personally use the quick print mode that uses less ink and prints at twice the speed. I have used the included OCR software that comes with the printer and it works marvelously, allowing you to dump the scanned material directly into the application of your choice.Overall the printing is fast and the color is good. I have not tried the photo paper or ink yet so I cannot comment."
3,not hungry,"I wanted the writing here to be as great as Knut Hamsun's own Hunger--and of course, it simply can't be. I'm not at all sure that it's Ferguson's fault. I wanted to know what Hamsun's mindset was at the time of struggling through his masterpieces like Hunger and Pan and Victoria, I wanted to be able to get inside the great writer's mind...and it just can't be, because the author of this bio wasn't there. If you want psychological insights and great writing you must go to the source: Hamsun's own novels. Yes, you'll get dates and details here in Enigma, but that does not make for interesting and/or engaging reading. I was disappointed. The gifted, self-taught Knut Hamsun remains a favorite, though. One of the giants."
2,Panasonic Shaver Replacement Foil,Not as good as the original. Major vibration and pinching along with the replacemenrt blade; constantly loosening would not stay in place during function. I threw out the whole electric shaver and bought new one.
3,Poor Quality Foil,"The foil that I received had a different appearance (goldish vs original silver) and was not in Panasonic packaging, as pictured. I tried it anyway. My foil/razor now makes an unusually loud vibrating sound. Shaving has also become uncomfortable; the razor is grabbing the hairs and not easily cutting them. I'm wondering if this foil is a cheap generic made by a company other that Panasonic.P.S. I contacted the Buy-it-now-store via the Amazon.com site and explained the problem with the foil. I received a full refund within a couple of days. They get a couple of stars for good customer service."
4,A gift,"It was a gift for my mother because she loves John Berry's version of ""O Holy Night."" Unfortunately I did not realize it was a live version and that threw me for a little while, but his voice is so strong and vibrant, that the live version was just as good as a studio one."
5,An absolute must for all bird watchers in India.,"Beautiful hand drawn illustrations, detailed characteristics, habitat, calls and everything else you need to know to identify a bird. A real work of art."

1,Not a POCKET size,"While this dictionary is certainly adequate in terms of having all the words in Italian and English that you will probably ever want to look up, it is very misleading to refer to the dictionary as a POCKET dictionary. Unless you want to lug a fat paperback in a giant pocket, you would do better to find a smaller version if you really want a ""pocket"" dictionary, so it did not meet my needs and I was misled by its title."
2,enter key in wrong place,if you look real closely in the picture you can see that they have moved and changed the shape of the enter key. This means that every time I try to press enter I get a forward slash. I'm sure I would get used to it after a while....but is it worth the hassle? I'm taking it back. the mouse is great. the keyboard sounds rattly and cheap when you type on it too.
4,Israel: The Blessing or the Curse,"Israel: The Blessing or the Curse is great book! There are just too many occurrences where USA actions against Israel were followed by ""natural disasters"" (note that God created ""nature"" and is therefore in control of nature!) to be coincidences. I like to call them God-incidences.All the information in Chapter 6 is fully documented in the back of the book and research at a library can verify the correlation that was made.Note: Now I would imagine that McTernan can add an addendum to his book. A few days after the Jewish residents were forced out of the Gaza strip (an action supported by the USA), New Orleans residents were evacuating the city faster than the highways would permit. And as I write this review on Aug. 31, 2005, the TV reporters are saying the worst is yet to come!"
4,I told ya so...,"Jan 29th, 2003 the president in the state of the union said ""In the Middle East we will continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine.""A few days later, the space shuttle Colombia breaks up over the president's home state of Texas roughly over a town called Palestine.We'll have to see what comes out to see if Bush was twisting Isreal's arm again to give away land like he was doing right before Sep 11th, 2001.This book could have been shorter because much of the material is repeated over and over, which made the book very annoying for me to read. Sorry Bill and John. You did your homework right, but next time get a good editor and let them do their job."
4,Out of the Question,"The first two chapters are wordy and I think Sweet enjoys hearing himself talk. Beginning in Chapter 3, the book is full of discussion topics and challenging perspectives."
2,Not on my wavelength,"I give the author credit for embracing an important topic and addressing it through the lens of spirituality and faith. However, I found the author's language impossible to grasp. I was hoping for more practical advice to help me with the difficult transition that my son is making from college to career and this book, well-intentioned as it may be, simply took me into a fog of mushy ideas that I just did not have the patience for. I hope it can strike a stronger chord with others."
3,Taiji Sword,"The beginning prefaces are informative. The stories of great Taijiquan masters are fascinating. The descriptions of the various postures are fairly clear. Unfortunately, the black and white photos accompanying the descriptions are faded and grainy. The hands, sword and body often disappear into the background leaving one guessing as to the correct form of the posture."
3,Tai Ji Sword in Cheng Wei Ming's rendition...,"Im giving this book 3 stars based on a technicality - if one takes away the pictures of Mr. Ming doing the form, all that's left is the transmission myths from the Yang family.If one attempts to learn the sword form based only on the photos and the description below them - that may prove a hard task, since there is no connective tissue between the postures. Furthermore, the order in which postures flow may be different depending on the school.However, the photos themselves are very descriptive of this high level practitioner and scholar, Yang Cheng Fu's left hand man (right hand man perhaps being Cheng Man Ching). Which is fine, as a testament of tradition and Yang family transmission.Other than what i ve descrived above, the book is a wonderful evidence of how the anicent art lives, and constantly revitalizes through the priceless efforts of today's Western as well as Eastern players."
4,a charming history,"I wish the pictures weren't so scratchy, but this is a facinating read for anyone studying Taichi sword."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this book along with a video on T'ai Chi sword. I bought the book for some stories not for instruction. There are a few stories which were fun to read but there is no reason to own this book. The only redeeming quality of this book is the old time T'ai Chi pictures which are cool! But not worth spending any money on.
3,different bottle but same product,different bottle but same product I use this as cutting fluid and sharping oil also as wood stain it has many uses and its non toxic
1,Art Rock? This has got to be a joke!,"One cent for this disc, one star because of the bravery to release this to the music buying public. This is complete garbage. I got another disc by this duo also in a bundle along with 13 other assorted discs on ebay and these two disc's are really horrible..But for one cent; it will make one heck of a coaster for your favorite beverage.."
4,Work as Advertised,I purchased these glasses specifically to view the analglyphs from NASA. Works excellent. These provide a lot better clarity than the paper glasses I used to use. I'm glad I bought them.
1,Very Disapointed,Bought these glasses to use with 3D DVD on my large Plasma TV. These do not work at all and are a total failure. I am very disapointed.
1,ANOTHER JOKE FROM ED WOHANKA,SAVE YOUR MONEY FOLKS.....THIS GUY CAN'T EVEN GIVE THE ALBUM AWAY. THIS IS THE WORST ATTEMPT AT MUSIC I HAVE HEARD. DO US ALL A FAVOR DOC HOLIDAY AND QUIT THE BUSINESS.
1,pile of junk,"I have owned this monster for almost 1 year so maybe wife will let me smash it with a hammer now. If you like to hear ""problems communicating with printer"" this is the machine for you. Also you will learn to uninstall and reinstall software flawlessly. Maybe I could give it to my mother in law?"
4,No Worries,"I too got this printer with a new Dell computer, but I have had NO PROBLEMS!!! The software install is flawless and the printer itself is so user friendly. I have NEVER HAD any paper jams or problems with ink or scanning. What more could you want from a print/scanner combination, this printer is a piece-of-cake."
2,Ink is expensive,Unit was broken more than it worked. Not a very effective unit. Seemed to be a very cheap unit. Don't buy!!
1,Run The Other Way!,"Lexmark's television adds state they 'help you to print less.' I have found this to be true because I can seldom get their product to print at all!My X85 worked OK for about the first year: there were some issues, but I could usually get it to print. One of Lexmark's suggested fixes for when I couldn't coax anything from my X85 was to unplug all the cables and let it sit overnight -- mixed results. Reliability has become more erratic with time. It may be that I have updated my operating system, and although I have downloaded new drivers that are supposed to work for my new OS from Lexmark's website, the software is very buggy. Also worth considering is the X85 really doesn't seem to like you to refill your own cartridges -- too bad because the cartridges are very expensive and it is a nasty waste of materials to throw these things away.Perhaps this product works OK in the Windows world -- I don't know. If you have a Mac you should run the other way -- fast!"
1,Very Disappointing,"This was purchased with our Dell computer and wish we'd purchased another brand. The paper jams a lot, you receive messages of problems communicating and now it's seized up. It's only about a year old. The printing quality is adequate for printing paperwork, but if you're looking to print quality pictures, I'd look elsewhere. Pictures come out very grainy with lines across them most of the time and it uses way too much ink. The instruction booklet isn't very helpful either. I like the 3-in-one idea, but I'd look for it in another brand."
4,User Friendly,"I bought the Lexmark X85 some months back and have had no problems with the printer or my computer's connection to the printer. It is user friendly, I didn't even need to refer to the manual for any directions. I've never once had a paper jam. The only bad thing I can think of is the ink costs more than most, but even that is bypassable with all the refill packs going around. The picture quality and speed of printing is the best i've seen for an inkjet."
4,Great product!,Price is a bit expensive but I have been unable to find another shadow I like as much. The color has been difficult to match. The eye shadow also lasts forever!
5,Best method book I have ever used,This method book is very well thought out. It is challenging for a beginner guitarist but has a well-structured method for learning basic blues and rock guitar so stick with it and don't get discouraged. It took me over a year to work through it but it's well worth it. My playing has improved tremendously as a result of using this product. Highest possible recommedation.
4,Good book,This is a good book. This is not for beginners. You need to have some basic skills before jumping into this book.
4,TAYLOR MADE!,"Martin taylor does what no man (or woman for that matter) can do:Namely, give him a plank of wood and six strings and he will make you sing, dance or any old thing. The jazz purists ,I know ,won't and don't acknowledge this album but...what he makes of old Isaac Hayes numbers and Django type material just makes you glad to be alive. Martin can also be seen on a great website:geocities.com/johnmedd."
5,WHOA!!! The Free DVD included is a MUST SEE!,"Webster Hall always has hot Dance music, and cool free stuff with their CD's but I've never expected such a hot-n-. . . FREE DVD!!! If you're into cool clubs, hip music, and wild crazy girls, erotically dancing and hooking up...THEN THIS IS FOR YOU! Expect . . . girls shaking it to pulse pounding beats on this DVD. Makes me almost forget that I bought it for the music! Sure it has all the hits that KTU and Z100 plays...BUT IT ALSO HAS . . .!!!! I heard it was filmed at the club during their Friday night Amateur Burlesque competition; so if you're too busy to stay out late at the club, then bring the Burlesque competition home to the ""privacy"" of your own bed room! Hubba Hubba!!!!"
5,great,"boyd takes you back in time and presents the texas revolution on a daily historical basis, fascinating."
3,I needed more information,"I still have not been told why they claim 99% of all baby deaths as sids! My daughter was sitting up in her car seat,still had a heartbeat more than one hour after she was found,but they claim she died from S.I.D.S. Sids to me is a copout when they don't want to take the time to figure out what is wrong with a baby! Can you giveme something I can accept? I need to know how my daughter died!"
1,Bed sharing is PROVEN unsafe for SIDS!You can't PREVENT SIDS,"First of all, anyone who uses the phrase, SIDS Prevention is either trying to sell you something, or doesn't know what they're talking about. You cannot prevent SIDS. Second, Sears is a huge bed sharing advocate. The US Comsumer Product Safety Commission, just concluded a 8 year study that strongly advises against bed sharing to reduce SIDS. The American Academy of Pediactrics and US Public Health Svc. backs up this study. Dr. Sears may know a lot about bonding with your baby, but please do not look to him about SIDS info. My little girl died of SIDS a in Oct. '99, and it's important to me that the correct info. gets circulated. See the SIDS Alliance web page for more information about SIDS."
5,Blessed Oil,"Great size to use in church services for healing services,or for annoiting purposesSister J. Bausley"
3,A little bit thick,Make sure to be careful with this product. It is quite thick but otherwise ok. It can be a bit of a battery eater but no worse than other products from the same company.
3,Great Value,"The shape is great but I wish the speed settings very more adjustable,the lowest speed setting is pretty intense,wish it had lower speed settings. It goes from vrooom to vrrroooommmmmm nothing below or in between."
4,quite thunder,All of the Doc Johnson full size lucid dream series vibrators share the same motor. It's quite and powerful-perfect for small apartments or other situations where you have neighbors in close proximity. #28 in particular makes a great teaser as it does a pleaser. The design is perfect for deep thrust action. Ridges are great!
1,Buyer Beware,"At first glance, this looks like a good remote. IF it did everything it claims to be able to do, it would be. However, this remote does about 5% of what it claims. For devices that it does recognize, it only ends of having about 20% of the buttons in its' automatic memory. You have to program the rest. When programming, it does not always take, so you are then stuck with a unversal remote that won't stop your movie or allow you to scroll through your digital cable menu. It worked very, very, poorly on my Comcast digital cable remote and in the end wouldn't learn a lot of the buttons. This 'thing' was a complete waste of money in my opinion. If you want a good universal remote, look elsewhere.."
3,fun read,it gave some insights on what cruising is really like for a couple and there's some funny stories in it. it was written a few years ago so some of the stuff isn't really valid now though.
4,A busy life in persepctive..,"Picked this book up at the botanical garden in st. croix a week ago and now just finished. The ending could be a book in it self or in some respect more paramount. Additionally added editing was needed.I agree that more technical information could have been presented however I think this would have weighted the book down.I took the book as just that kind of an over view. I would have liked more explaination of storey and less generality. I enjoy her writting style for sure and enjoyed the breaks between chapters to read one and put it down instead of trudging along for 30 pages at a time.Curious to read her other book Life in the left lane, considering we just got back from where she is from, to hear her opinion. We couldnt grasp everything at work there on a two week vacation.I would recommed this to most anyone who is interested in sailing or is adventurous/outdoorsy. Or call it ""island living"". Good read enjoyed it. That is what is most important."
4,Intense and works,"Okay, Ive been using this product for a solid six months. I am a person that works out regularly and can probally give u a solid review on any good weight loss supplement out there cause ive tried it. I lost 35 pounds using Xenadrine for my first 20 lbs down and thermoex for my last 15 and to maintain my current weight. This product is for people that are having trouble losing those stubborn pounds that are hard to get off when ur in reasonably good shape as it is. They are for people with a high caffeine tolerance. I usually take em to get me going for my long hours at work. You really want to push it at the gym take two of these bad boys with a scoop of no explode and see how hard u push it at the gym. This pill along with those products dont necessary make u lose the weight, they give u the push the energy to work hard at the gym."
4,Good,Be sure to get at least 2 or 3 months supply of these. Just using one bottle won't help very much. This is also not meant to pop a pill and lose weight sitting on the couch. I used it along w/ my 3-4 times a week cardio and noticed some additional loss but never felt jumpy or anxious like some of the other products.
1,Makes you feel terrible!,"I tried to use this product, but after the first two days. I felt nauseous and generally sick to my stomach. It does give you a energy boost, but due to the feeling it gave me. I didn't want to eat at all or work out. Plus I started off easy, far below the recommended per day, I can't imagine how I would have felt if I went recommended dosage. I love BSN products but steer clear of this one."
3,I miss Ephedra!,"This product is a SUPPLEMENT to your healthy eating and physical fitness routine, not a magic pill. If you have a low caffeine tolerance, do not drink A LOT of water or take them on an empty stomach, it may cause cramps or headaches. I usually alternate between Thermonex and Astrophex, but after being off both for a month, I definitely miss the energy and focus.Only 3 stars because it's is not Ephedra, which actually was a magic pill -seriously, that stuff was awesome! Otherwise, the price is right and it works as described."
1,"I bought and paid for this item, never received it. Beware.","I bought and paid for this item some time back. I never received it or a refund. The company had tracking numbers for the package and REQUIRED a signature, which I worked during the day and was unable to provide. They refused to make alternate arrangements and never refunded the monies. BEWARE. This is not the company to do business with."
4,you got to have it,"Jonny Pacheco is number 1 salsa maestrogood sound good salsa, his style is uniqueand all the people who collaborate on this production are real salseros"
3,Some good stuff - there's potential here,"This little known Canadian band has a sound that passes through several genres in one album. My personal taste makes Optic Nerve the standout song on this album - haunting and beautiful, I really feel like that is the direction flux A.D. should be moving. A good listen though, and some really catchy tunes. This is a group to watch."
5,A novel that isn't.,"This book was written as a novel to keep Abe Lincoln from arresting the author, as he was wanton to do during the Civil War years. It is full of historical facts that make it a book of special study and not general reading. It is well written, easily understandable and needs to be read with other Civi War books. This is what I used it for. It provides another view."
1,You CAN judge a book by it's cover!,"This book was listed for sale as either ""very good"" or "" like new"". When I recieved the book, which at least was in a timely manner, it looked like it had been used as a football. The entire book was extremely worn out. It was almost unusabe for fear of pages falling out. It was shipped WAY underpackaged. The ""envelope"" that it was shipped in was way too flimsy for a book of this weight. I did not return it because I recieved it just in time to start class. My suggestion? Don't list a product/item as a better condition than it is actually in. Very tacky!"
2,only a little bit helpful,"This book does contain useful information, but you could probably learn just as easily by looking at teaching aids online. Also my teacher is very dissapointed in the book for it's lack of diferentiation between html and xhtml styles. It combines them quite often and makes it difficult for someone who is trying to learn new style code instead of depreciated code.Also the layout of the book is terrible. There are lines all over the page that do nothing but distract the reader. Apparently white space wasn't good enough for this author."
1,"Too Expensive, Too Fast,","I cannot recommend this book. The chapters pace the information too fast. The tutorials are easy to follow, but do a poor job of explaining what is going on.If you already know html, this book will be okay. If you don't know html, find another book."
3,"Good book but, had some problems!","I gave this book a 3 star rating because; I had some problems with it.Some of the problems I found were in:Tutorial 5 on Frames, the lesson was too vague to apply to the teacher's assignment to do our own frameset.Tutorial 6 on Forms, the lesson was so difficult to get through, my teacher needed to verify the code order using the teacher's version.Even though parts of this book were helpful, I would search for other options.Good Luck, Everyone."
4,A solid set of tutorials for beginners,"This book contains a solid set of tutorial based instruction for learning the basics of HTML. You need no prior Web experience to make sense out of this material though any you have might allow you more freedom to skip around to the most relevant parts. There is also a new companion set of videos (sold separately) that demonstrate how to build Web pages (ISBN 1-4188-3938-8), available from the publisher."
5,Very good book for a start to learning Web Design,I found this book to be well written as a relative HTML novice and it was comprehensive enough (hence the title) in scope. I thought the projects and exercises were all well thought out. I especially appreciated that they gave a layout reference for all coding during the tutorials to make sure it was written and placed properly. They even gave a set of review-question answers keys at the end of each chapter which was useful for double checking your knowledge.I would recommend this to anyone thinking of getting into Web Design.
1,DVD is a waste of time,This DVD is a absolute waste of time. It is poor quality and has no narrative at all.
4,All paths lead to the same source.,"If you accept what William Blake said, that all religions are one, then you should have no problem accepting that all prayers seek to accomplish the same goal: communication with the divine. For me, there is no distinction between monks singing a Gregorian chant and a group of individuals in saffron robes chanting Hare Krishna. Both strive to evoke God's presence, although they choose to address God by different names. If people realized that there is essentially no distinction between religions, except the names chosen to address God and different messengers teaching the paths to enlightenment, the world would be a better place.My one critique on this book is that it contains a disproportionate number of Christian prayers. Personally, I would have preferred it to be a little more balanced."
2,"Get the much-superior ""Lash"" EP instead","_Show_ was recorded and released without the band's consent, and was disowned by David Yow shortly after its release. The half-studio half-live _Lash_ EP was recorded and released the same year, and not only does it have the band's approval, it's a much better-recorded and better-sounding disc, the true logical follow-up to Liar, which was one of the best albums of the nineties. Support the band!"
5,Full of Energy,I first saw the Jesus Lizard at Lollapalooza '95 and completely disregarded them. I didn't pay attention to their set at all. For some reason I bought this album after the concert. It was beautiful. I had no idea music could be this aggressive and energetic. I liked it immediately and they became my favorite band. This is their best album. I saw them live one more time in '98 or '97 and their set was almost an exact copy of this album. That includes David Yow's yelling and cussing at the crowd and getting almost naked. Many have said that this is the best live band ever. I would agree.
3,okay,one velcro cuff ripped i fixed it myself and was quite upset. the others work fine though so 3 stars
2,Would not recomend,Ok for a laugh or if you are just trying to start slow. Better of useing some neck ties or a more expensive set.
3,"ok for the money, def. beginner set","This set comes as shown in the picture.The material is soft and nice to wear.The mask though is a bit big and the elastic is long, so you can see out from around your nose where it does not fit tight, which kind of defeats the whole purpose.The restrains are sturdy and come with a long strap that can be tied around wherever you wanna be tied up to.I would have given it more stars if the mask was not so big and the elastic starp was not so long or worn out that it slips of your face, might have to do some improvements myself :)Altogether a good beginners set."
4,"Comfortable, well built, but not long enough","You can't beat the price for these straps and how they comfortably strap in your arms and legs. My wife loves to get tied up and these were what we were looking for... The only problem is we have had to adjust them to make them work on our king size bed. I think they would work perfectly for any bed of a queen and smaller. But my wife is 5'7"" and the straps, when tied to the bed frame, were not long enough for her to be tied in on all 4 corners. We had to use some string on one side, and make a loop large enough so we could hook her in on all 4 straps. so we use the straps to wrap around the wrists and ankles, but had to use string to make them reach long enough.The blindfold is soft and comfortable just like everyone else said. Overall you can't beat the value for the beginners bondage. Don't think we'll get more serious bondage than this. Its perfect."
1,"Don't look at the picture, that's not the product you are being sent","The picture shows velcro loops at both ends of the teathers, there's only one loop and you have to tie the other. Also, I don't know what kind of king size bed the people have that say that it fits one, but it doesn't, unless they had a footboard to tie it to."
4,Good price. Good product.,"So I was looking for something to replace the dirty socks my significant other was using to tie each other up during ""playtime,"" so I decided to try these out. I'd say it's the best quality, cheap version of beginner bondage you can find. By that I mean, it's very decent quality, firm and strong, with a soft velvety inner lining, and velcro to keep it all together. I've seen the high quality silk and chain versions, and for us, a slightly experimental couple, this is just perfect. Can't wait to use it again..."
5,bondage,you are in control with this bondage fantasy kit. you do want you want and they cant do a thing to stop you...
3,Not The Best,"Brought this for my G/F and her comments where:#1 It's not vibrating hard enough#2 It's too solid, they should make it flexible#3 I prefer my dildo#4 It's really cute doe but I don't like itKinda wasted my money buying this but...."
3,A good book for general information.,"This is a good book for someone who is not really familiar with Boxers and wants basic information. For someone who is already a Boxer fan, something a little more substantial is in order."
2,pretty generic,"I got this book used so it wasn't a big deal, but only the first half deals with boxers. The second half is a comprehensive training, health, and general care section for dogs. Only problem is there are hundreds of pictures, but not of Boxers! Boxers have their own training and health problems that this book didn't cover. I think if the info was going to be generic there should have at least been pictures of Boxers throughout. Worth the used price though."
4,"Good for beginners, like myself","This is a great book for beginners, like me! I'm probablly going to buy a boxers soon and it was very good with the basics. Of course, this book is in the favor of the Boxer and does not have many cons about buying a Boxer. Very good to get to know the breed though."
5,A good book for someone wishing to learn the basics,"I read this book in a little over 2 hours and found it to be well written and informative, especially since I've never owned a dog. It gives you insite into this breed and simple instructions on care and training."
2,More about aesthetics than function,"This is a very good-looking filter. We used to live in Orlando where the water tastes like sewage, so a good filtration system was a must. This filter definitely cleans the water to drinking standards and the on/off functionality is well thought out. However, this is one of the SLOWEST water filters we have tried. It starts off okay but after a week or so, we wanted to return it because it took so long just to fill a glass. We tried another filter and the same things happened. A friend who was staying with us informed us that her PUR had done the same thing.So, we went back to Target and purchased a Clear Flow for 2/3 the price of the PUR and we couldn't be happier. It has 3X the water flow and looks just as good on the faucet. Go with Clear Flow or Brita instead of PUR."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this device. It doesn't last past the first filter, as putting a replacement in apparently causes all of the seals to fail, and the ergonomic design means the water leaking out of the filter indicator that is unfiltered mixes in with the filtered water coming out of the device, so that you, at best, get slightly cleaner water, but not filtered.I've never been more disappointed in a device, what's the point if you have replace both the filter AND the faucet mount every time the filter runs out?"
3,its ok,I expected wonders from peoples reviews. But works just like any regular face wash. I prefer st ives face scrub.
5,Excellent Product,I love this scrub. I think it is some of the best I've ever used. It is gentle to you skin and not a wasteful product as so many are. A small dab and water will do.
5,Love this,"Ive used this product before but couldnt find it in the stores near me since ive moved. I love it* I have scars from acne and it has always done the job to lighten it up. It takes awhile but keep with it, youll definitely see a difference. Also pair it with Ambi Fade cream as a moisturizer"
5,Perfect for Sensitive Skin,"I love this face scrub! I have pale, sensitive, combination skin, and I found that this face scrub is not too harsh on my skin. I used to use St. Ives and I felt like I was rubbing sandpaper on my face and it would feel dry and stingy afterwards. But when I tried this product for the first time, I gently buffed away the dry spots on my face, leaving it extremely smooth even the next morning."
2,Doesn't do what it says it will,"My skin: No serious acne problems, just uneven skin toneWhat i was looking for: something to wash my face clean with a days worth of makeup while simultaneously evening out my skin tone. Also, minimize any marks i had on my face.What it did: i've been using this product for 2 weeks now, and i'm not impressed at all. It may have wiped the makeup off, but i think my face looks less smooth than it did before i started this product. It has not evened out my skin tone."
1,Makes my skin break out,"This stuff is terrible. It makes my skin break out because it leaves a waxy residue on your face after you wash it off that clogs my pores. Also, the ""microbeads"" are a joke - you can barely tell they're there and they don't help exfoliate at all. Worst of all is that this scrub is like a gel, and I prefer scrubs that are like a cream. To top it off, it does not ""brighten"" or even out my skin tone at all. I would not buy this garbage again."
2,not that great..,"I have been using this product for the past 2 days and so far, my acne has worsen and my skin has been feeling itchy."
1,This did not work for me.,"I gave this stuff a chance and used it for a couple months.The tiny stones or whatever those things were only irritated my skin. It evens out your complexion alright, by making your face and cheeks abnormally red from the irritation. Since it advertises evening out complexion, I figured the red blotches from this product would even out eventually but to no avail. If that's what they call radiant, stay far away from this product.Only when I stopped using this product and went back to what I was using before, my skin actually got better than before I started using the Aveeno scrub.I'd like to believe the Aveeno brand is in business to help improve skin tone and texture, but this formula was just not right for me. I would not recommend this product to anybody and I hope they discontinue this product."
5,Gret for unfocused students,"I am homeschooling my 3rd grader, who has ADHD. I have found that this book is perfect for him in that it breaks paragraph writing into simple, clearly illustrated steps. For example, the first pages describe an overall paragraph, topic and supporting sentences. Then, there are several example paragraphs to work through with the student finding the topic sentence. From there, he learns to write topic sentences, and so forth. Even a highly distractable student is able to complete the simple short lessons, with good comprehension."
3,Bad Quality but It's Cheap,"I bought this to record some vocals to lay over some guitar tracks I've played and recorded on my computer. I knew it probably wouldn't sound too great but I just wanted to get some vocals recorded and onto my CPU. I was right about it sounding bad, the quality is poor and the mic is not very sensitive, you basically have to put your mouth on the mic for it to pick up your voice. But hey it was extremely cheap, and it does work so I can't complain. If I was looking to use it for recording something non-music related it would be fine. But as for music, the quality is bad."
2,Disapointingly Mild,"Being a long time consumer of Lavazza Creama E Gusto which I find most enjoyable, I thought I'd give Super Creama a try.Very disapointing on flavor and fullness. For a latte I find it necessary to double the quantity in the basket and cut the milk by 80-90% so instead of a 10 ozdouble, it's a single shot expresso with a dash of milk. The bean is a medium brown in color that is reflected in it's charater. Back to ""Creama E Gusto"""
1,not-so-super crema,"Disappointing taste, disappointing response by seller. Opened the 2-lb. bag of beans, and there was no aroma. Made my cappuccino & my husband's black espresso: no pleasing flavor, in fact unpleasant flavor. Tried again, to be certain. Not good! Mailed entire bag back at my expense, as no answer via phone on Friday evening & wanted to get it over and done with. Received call a few days later from a rude and insulted rep. who chastised me for returning without authorizarion. The policy is no returns on coffee. Refused me a credit or even in-house credit. I let my platinum credit card handle it, the seller has the coffee beans and my money!"
1,Only Lasted a Month,"The second Doc Johnson that has died in less than three months. Am really disappointed.Overall had a good feel, nice vibe, four speed, but... dead is dead."
4,Must have for Le Creuset fans,"We bought this instead of getting another panini maker. Works well, you just need to make sure to heat it enough and give it time. Not as fast if you are use to larger panini maker."
5,Want to read some fair dinkum Aussie literature?,"Peter Goldsworthy's book is one that defines Australian literature. Not only does he comment on cloning, he manages to challenge ideas of science and religion at the same time. He calls into question gender-relationships. He explores the meaning of family and mothering. He creates characters who are as unpredictably human as your neighbors. Values espoused by one turn out to be made tangible by another. Setting the whole ball rolling is the challenge to create a human clone from blood centuries old supposedly taken from the very cross from which Jesus was hung. I read Honk If You Are Jesus for an Australian Lit. and Film class I took while studying abroad in Queensland, Australia. The book itself is quite a trip! Happy reading!"
4,Extreme Chewer Still Defeated,"I bought this for our boxer/curr mix. (She's about 45 lbs and 8 months old). She has chewed most everything that she has into small pieces, and half of the time, I find parts of it later, recycled :S She did last a few hours more with this product, but eventually even this bone bit the dirt. The only thing with this is that when she swallowed bits of the bone before I was able to see that she'd bitten into it, she developed a serious rash all over her body and one of her eyes swelled almost shut. I gave her benadryll and that seemed to do the trick. Beware of not checking this bone often for small parts eaten off; the color on the ends is deceptive because the undercoating is the same color. It would do fine for a dog with not such a strong bite reflex."
2,bloody mess...,"Not a healthy chew toy. Ends of bone are made of hard plastic which becomes jagged and sharp after only a little bit of chewing. Because of bulbous shape of bone, the jagged plastic rubs against dogs' gums, causing bleeding.There are other bones made from similar plastic, that are much flatter shaped--helping reduce the chance of plastic cutting into dogs' gums.Or you could try the Kong rubber bonesKONG Goodie Bone Dog Toy, Medium, Red. They last pretty long with our two mid-sized moderately aggressive chewers."
1,I would not buy this again,"I bought this toy for my lap puppy who is 6 months old. Within 24 hours, small shards of the plastic were wearing off. I immediately threw it away because I was worried about him digesting the small pieces of plastic. I cannot believe someone has not made the Nylabone folks pull this off the shelf. It really worries me that they say it is Vet approved."
1,Dangerous,"My medium breed dog easily chewed off the ends until they were frayed and spikey. The worst part was that the hard points created by the chewing cut his paw open in two places while he was playing with it. Needless to say, we'll stick to the more basic nylabones from now on."
2,"Normally happy with nylabone products, but...","While this seems like a fairly good product, we've had a problem with this one. This is not a solid bone with green rubber over the middle. It's three pieces with the ends attached with plastic pins. To the story... My vizsla-pit (amazing chewer) somehow managed to chew the nub loose from the green middle section, by chewing off a portion of the side of the nub. She then proceeded to get the, now c-shaped, nub stuck over her teeth to around below her jaw. It took half an hour of working on it and a swollen lip to get it unstuck. Moral of the story is that I'll never buy chew toys that aren't one piece again. Giving two stars because my dogs absolutely love the nylabone dinosaur chews (and no one reads a one star review)!"
1,Will not be buying this again!,"I know that my 1 year old bulldog is an extreme chewer, so I bought him this toy. I had read the reviews about the middle part being chewed off, but I didn't think that my dog would or could chew off the middle part, especially since he had different nylabones before and he loved chewing the part he was SUPPOSED to chew. I WAS SO WRONG. The first thing he did was chew up the middle part and had chewed pieces off in less than an hour."
3,Durable but dogs don't play with it,Got this toy because I thought it would be extra durable for my two German Shorthair Pointers who tend to destroy every toy they get... they aren't really interested in this one so it doesn't get played with.
3,Unsure about the safety,"Our 45lb lab/shepherd mix LOVES to chew. She recently started chewing on ""her"" chair we have in her room (thankfully it is an inexpensive fold out chair) so I decided to take this toy back out of retirement. We got it for her a few months ago and she really loved it, but after weeks of hard chewing the ends started to get sharp bits sticking out. I was worried because it was causing her gums to bleed but it doesn't seem like she is in any type of pain and she really seems to love it so I'm letting her have another trial run tonight. I'm going to get her a nylabone ""souper"" next."
4,Depends on the Dog,"I originally purchased this for our black lab puppy because she could chew through everything and I needed the toughest toys I could find. This toy was one of the only toys she had that actually held up, so that is a huge plus for strong chewers! However, I purchased a smaller version for my 3 year old shih tzu and my chihuahua puppy and it pretty much got ignored. I think it is difficult for them to chew on. Also, these two dogs are not as strong chewers, so they have more stuffed animals and other toys around to choose from, where as our lab was not allowed to have stuffed animals because she shredded them. Overall, all three dogs preferred just a regular-looking nylabone to this one. The black lab had her regular nylabone chewed down to a tip, but it took her awhile to do that. I would only purchase this bone if your dog is a very strong chewer and you are having trouble keeping toys around for it, otherwise it may get ignored."
3,nylabone,"They are too large and heavy even for st bernard, They makes dents in decking cannot have in house will damage flooring"
5,Great chew toy!,"This is durable and the variety of textures will capture the dog's interest. This size is huge, so only for a big dog. Otherwise it is too heavy."
3,My Dog Is a Chewer,"The nylabone part was great for my chewer, but she had the rubber in the center destroyed in no time."
3,Not for my dog,"My dog didn't really care for this chew toy. She has loved other Nylabone chew toys, but I struck out with this one. My dog likes theNylabone Dura Chew Bone, Chicken Flavor, Soupermuch more."
3,May not be for hardcore chewers,I have a lab-wiemaraner mix and he can devour almost any toy in minutes. He liked this toy but he was able to chew up the green rubber pretty quickly. The hard plastic ends get sharp with a lot of chewing. Didn't hold up as well as I thought it would.
3,"It's tough, just too tough","This toy has held up tremendously well, but it does have a problem in design. Once your dog chews on it for a little bit, it seems to make some very sharp edges on the ends. The last time I saw my dog chewing on it, it left the bone covered in blood on both ends. Once I picked it up I quickly realized why. If it was made a bit softer I think the sharp edges created by chewing would not become a problem"
2,"More Flute, Less Accompaniment","The premise is nice, but before the end of the first track, I was disappointed. The flute was drowned out by what should have been the background music. Indian flutes have a very beautiful and unique tone and sound, but it was difficult to hear on this cd. At times it did take center stage, but for the most part, I felt the ""star"" of this genre played second fiddle to overimaginative keyboard music.If you want to hear the flute in all its beauty, I suggest some of Mary Youngblood's music, particularly Beneath the Raven Moon and The Offering."
5,Experience A Well Done Book,"The Happy Housewife is an experience to read, a good one, which takes time to digest. It flows well, reading is easy, but the information presented here, from the author's own experience, is done with a good heart and a light hand. Ellizabeth Baker gives you not only her experience, but she is a story teller with other housewives' examples that make you stop and think about your own situation. She also presents solutions which many of us look for on a daily basis and challenges your thinking on the whole world of ""housewifeliness."" Good for readers of any age and at any place along your lifeline, who are looking for ways to change their perspective about being a housewife. The chapter for single women is loaded with good ideas and her sense of humor emerges along the way. A good read."
2,"Waste of DVD space, less than a half hour!","What is this new trend that Warner Brothers is doing with their Hanna Barbera product? We already know that the DVD sets are a success.This episode is from the 1980's revival of the show, so the episode is not in the Season One box set. These later episodes were produced shorter (22 minutes) with new end titles and an updated theme song in the opening. This is the original syndication presentation of the 1980s series."
