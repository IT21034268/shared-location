2,Not Grand Turismo,"If U are like me you enjoyed Grand Turismo & G.T.2 for the way the cars drove! very realistic as video games go, but the graphic's could have been better, and no damage modeling? Now I bought a Dreamcast and this game hoping to get at least the better graphics, Well thebackground's are sweet! but the car's leave alot to desired. The game also left me cold with the way it drove,none to realistic. If U like your games heavy on the arcade side this game will please U, but if U have a drivers license and want to live out your racer's fantasies this game will disapoint! To bad, So much more power with the Dreamcast and except for Ferrari F-355 there does not seem to be a decent driving sim out there."
2,I'm telling the truth - there are better racers... (sorry),"I was one of the guys who bought this game the first day - I was that excited. There are 3 things wrong with it, and they are wrong enough that there are better games to buy. First, it takes forever to build up to a good car. Truthfully, unless you want to spend hundreds of hours, be content with the little boxes. But mainly, the controls are too touchy. The cars have serious difficulty being controlled, and the only people who will argue with me, are children and people without a life - so they don't mind a game that is sort of like a relationship. This game abuses you from time to time. 3rdly, the interface is so tedious, that you go from menu to menu. Again, the only people that will love this are those who feel satisfaction for figuring out how to run it. Forget it - get ""Test Drive LeMans"" = it's much better, or ""Test Drive V-Rally"" or ""Sega Rally 2"". In my opinion - they all offer a better gaming time."
5,Mrs. Jordan's Profession: The Actress and the Prince,I have enjoyed all of Claire Tomalin's books and have now read all of them. Hopefully she will be coming out with another one soon.
2,Misleading Photo and Description,"They only send you one small jar of mustard (the strong Irish mustard) which is the least exciting one of the bunch. Do NOT look at the photo, they do not send all three. However, I haven't tried it yet so maybe it tastes really good - i just wish i knew that i was only getting the boring one because i was really interested in the two with whiskey in them instead."
5,A great introduction and teaser to the world of neuroscience,"I got this book in late 2006 as my very first introduction to the world of neuroscience. I am an electrical engineering PhD student, and coming from that background at the time, this book was very easy to pick up and read. The author seldom gets lost in the more complicated details, and when you have read a section and run the accompanying matlab scripts, you really get a sense that you've just peeked into a fundamental property of a neural system.I'd recommend this for any engineering student that wants to study neural systems. The biology is not daunting, but once you get a taste, I feel you are more prepared to venture into the biology that the systems in this book are based upon."
4,Does the job,"We purchased this beginner's cello book for our 9 year old at the request of his instructor. The book is easy to understand and has been helpful for instruction purposes. They did leave out a few parts of the cello structure, but they hit the main ones. We recommend the book as a good starter."
4,A good watch for the price I paid,"I bought this watch for my girl friend & she seemed to like it. I paid a little over 45 bucks and I am pleased with what I got. It came on the day, it was expected to be delivered and it came in one piece alright. Moreover the adjustable band makes it easier to fit in almost any wrist. The watch looks cool. Its a good buy!!!"
5,Nice Product for Someone Looking to Stand Out and Stay Within Budget,"This is an excellent watch with a nice, funky style to it - definitely not something you see everyday - but it's not over-the-top crazy, either. It is a nice enough size to be both stylish and functional.It will absolutely get noticed (and praised) on a daily basis...and you don't even have to break the bank!"
5,Very pleased!,"Very elegant and looks like a bracelet.It is perfect as a gift, it comes in a nice box and price is more than favorable."
2,Girl Power On Monster Mountain,"The special effects stunk and were done on the cheap. There were too many irritating characters. The story was decent, which is why I could not give it one star. I am sick of the overt attempt in B-rated horror movies to inject at least one lesbian couple, as if it remotely has anything to do with the story. The lack of a special effects budget really hurt what could have been a decent 2.5 star horror movie. The monsters were cartoonish. Not much to say about this film. I do, however, have something to say to this film. Goodbye. Don't waste your money"
1,Blood Predator,"Hello,Yes, I was taken in by the nice looking cover and caption. I would rate this movie as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. No redeeming qualities at all.Thanks,"
2,not what I thought it would be AT ALL,I was expecting the game to be A LOT more fun than this. I love Mary-Kate and Ashely and all but this game just wasn't at all fun. I couldn't get past this thing on the 4th level when your getting all the puzzle pieces. It isnt very fun so far and the real voices you can't understand. I hope that this was use to you.
3,I thought it would be exiting!,"I thought this game would be fun and it was for the first 5 staions of it !This game needed to much waiting to play.It said in the beigening about getting passwords but you never got any until you passed the mystery of the ballet bandit! This game also needed to much skill from gamers like me.I think this game threw off many Mary-Kate & Ashley fans through out the world. It also gave a very bad name to Mary-Kate & Ashley games like Pocket planner,The New Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley and Winners circle and all of those were very good games exept for this one. Until you have been playing your gameboy for at least three years you will not enjoy trying to control this game. Even my brother who is a Relly good gamer said it has very poor control and graphics.He's been playing for a little while now and still said that.If you are somebody planing to by this game I strongly suggest you don't!"
1,Totally Bogus Game,"This video game was lame. I'd rather try to have fun by digging a deep hole than by playing this game. I mean, the twins are okay on t.v., but the video game market is a place for innovation, creativity, and awesome gameplay. Any mystery solving game with two teenage girls is never going to stand up against the likes of Mario, Zelda, or any sports game for that matter. I am sorry, but some company got ripped off when they made this video game. I bet it only sold about twenty copies half of which were bought by the twins themselves. The other couple hundred games made should be taking out of stores and placed in the Hall of Fame for Lame Games."
1,Do Mary-Kate and Asley have a clue!,"This game is by far the biggest waste of money since ""Switchin Goals"". I guess you don't have a clue about videogames if you buy this horrid game. This game is even worst than and episode of ""Full House"", and it's almost as bad as ""Two Of A Kind"" which is still really bad. If you have money to blow you could feel better giving it to Mary-Kate and Ashley to help them fund a DECENT, and I mean DECENT movie. Or you could buy their dolls which makes even less sence because why would you need two of their dolls their TWINS! So in all this is the worst game ever and I mean EVER created. The worst thing is it's even to small to be a door stop and its to light to be a paper weight so it's like spending money for a joke book made by Al Gore, It's has know chance of selling and if you buy it, it's like listening to a Spice Girls CD. YOU WASTED YOUR MONEY! Thank you for reading my review, oh and have a nice day."
3,Average...Sorry!,"The show is ok and the material is worth watching once or twice...Dio's voice is shot...sorry. I wish this werent the case...if you can buy the DVD for under $5, you cant go wrong."
2,"A favorite of finches, siskins, and red squirrels","This morning I saw a red-tailed hawk swoop up and grab one of the little pine siskins in this cage feeder, right through the bars. I had thought the birds were safe in this feeder, but it turned out to be not quite true. The hawk had trouble pulling his foot back out of the cage with the pine siskin trapped in his claws, but he finally managed it.Even though Duncraft makes some great bird feeders, there are three reasons why I would not buy this model again:--red squirrels can squeeze through the bars and get at the seed--the cage bottom is very difficult to clean. The discarded husks, seeds, and bird droppings create a formidable cement, even after just one day (as I said, the small birds really like this feeder)--hawks can reach through the bars and extract the smaller birds"
2,So so hard to keep clean,"Do NOT buy this bird feeder. After a thunderstorm, half the feeder was full and it was hard as a rock. It took me hours to finally get all the seed out, the tube is almost impossible to clean. The birds DO like being inside the ""cage"" and the squirrels cant get to the seed but cleaning this feeder is next to impossible. Look for something else if looking for a squirrel resistant feeder."
4,Heavy Duty for sure,Bought for my Ford Freestar. Took over 2 hours because of misalignment in the Ford frame that had to be ground out to allow a bolt to pass through. Otherwise the install was fairly easy. About 40 pounds so have some props ready to hold it up.
4,She likes 'em,I bought these for my daughter...they are a really cute pair of shoes at an affordable price!
5,The best little manual about chords.,"If you don't want to invest much in a chord book, but you are hungry for the essential ones, this is your book. Period."
3,Cumbersome Chords,"I first purchased this book in 1973. I believe the book was first released in the late 1940's for returning GI's. I recently re-visited this book now having much guitar know-how behind me. The chord forms shown in this book use five and six strings and some chord forms are extremely cumbersome--quick chord changes are painful. There is also no theory--although now with the hindsight of experience I am able to supply the chord theory myself. I keep this book in my guitar library for reference, though. One might find an Arnie Berle chord study book more instructive and enjoyable, especially for self study."
1,TERRIBLE,"This book is a total wasteI'm going to be sending it back for a refund.Just a bunch of pics of old stuff - most of it ""cast"".Un-inspirational - esp if you are looking forsmithing ideas !"
5,Excellent review,Excellent review that comes from the authorities of EP who wrote Electrophysiology from cell to bedside. a great book for the clinician
3,"Influential, though merely adequate","Although not nearly the solid audio concept it wants to be, this album manages to squeeze off a few tightly woven, guitar epics after the apathetic front end. While never achieving any sort of material I felt this band has garnered in reputation, this album does at it's best accentuate the band's better assets in displaying their mogwai-esque habits. Although this band was undoubtedly influential to help pioneer this sound to the later generation of post-rock setups, Windsor always seemed to loose track of the prize when developing their themes, falling to the usual traps of becoming a slave to environment at the expense of the song."
3,Doesn't have deep pockets,"This mattress pad claims to cover mattresses up to 17"" thick. Ours is 13"" and it doesn't even come close to covering it."
4,Good product!,"I am potty training my son, so I needed a good waterproof mattress pad but didn't want to spend a lot of money. This fits the bill. It's lightweight but sturdy, and has already stopped one naptime accident from soaking through to the mattress, and held up well in the wash so far. Has a nice feel, and it doesn't seem to make him overly warm as some waterproof pads do. Our mattress is old and thin by today's standards, but the pad seems roomy enough that I think if we got a new thick mattress, it would still work. Very pleased with this purchase."
3,"not ""quiet""","The quality of this product as far as I can tell is phenomenal. The top is quite soft and may muffle the noise caused by the waterproof layer; however, this pad is certainly not ""quiet"" as described in the amazon review. Unlike the previous review, I found the pad to stretch well and fit on my mattress without any issues (but putting it on was noisy enough to convince me to immediately remove it)."
2,Won't Stay in Place and is Thin,"While more reasonably priced, this pad does not stay on the mattress. It slides in all directions and takes the sheets with it. It is thin and clearly feels like lower quality material. I have had the mattress get stained while this pad was on both because it slipped out of place and was not absorbent enough. Now I use it only as a backup as I rush to wash my other pad -- Simmons Beautyrest, which I would highly recommend purchasing instead."
3,Ok product until it tore,"Searching high & low for a waterproof mattress for my daughter I finally settled on this one, figuring I'd give it a try. The reviews are right it is very noisy when you move around on it, might not be quite as comfortable for a child. The thing that bothered me the most is they do not make these very well for over-sized mattresses. My daughter's twin mattress has some depth to it, after using it for a few months I went to put it on one day and the seams ripped right at the edge of the corner as I was putting it over the mattress. I ended up buying her another brand which you'll find on my reviews and so far it's worked perfect."
4,Waterproof Pad,"I'm sure this waterproof pad would be exceptional for most instances. It just couldn't handle the demands placed on it by our thirteen year old son. Thank goodness for hospital mattresses!That said, it should be fine for most other applications. It just wasn't made to handle the abuses this child can put things through."
2,Not the best for preparing a big sister.,"If you are looking for a book that will prepare your little one for the big brother/sister role, this is not it. This book, like most other Dora books focuses more on her journey home to see the babies than it does preparing, etc. It does not do much to explain most things that come along with becoming an older sibling. Keep looking if you want your child to be well informed on the upcoming arrival."
1,Useless Book,"This book does not have any care or thought about preparing a child for the arrival of a sibling. It is just a bunch of random Dora stuff (go through forest, fix a tire on car) then she arrives to her house where her mother has twins - completely random! Nothing about what life might be like with the arrival of a new baby.This book is just cashing in on the Dora brand, there are much better books about a new baby arriving than this. Save your money."
2,Let down,"We have bought many Dora books for our 4 year old daughter, and love most of them. I too was let down with this book because it didn't talk about responsibilities of big sisters and wished I had read more reviews to find out it ended with the mom having twins. Now I will have to explain to my daughter that we are not having two babies, only one."
5,Cute!,My two and a half year old daughter is a big Dora fan and is going to be a big sister soon; she loved this book that was based on a really cute actual Dora episode. I enjoyed it too.
5,Big Sister Dora is fun for older sister,My granddaughter Joey loves her new book and reads it with us every day. She is looking forward to her own sib any day now.
3,It's ok if you'r child likes Dora,"We got this book b/c my older daughter really loved Dora and she herself was getting ready to be a big sister. It has all the normal Dora adventure type stuff, but I was dissappointed that Dora's Mami did not breastfeed. I really would have liked to see that. Although with the bottle on the front cover I guess I should not have expected much."
2,Extremely slow shipping,"Do not use this seller if you need an item by a certain date. My item arrived the day after the last possible expected shipping date. The seller has no tracking for the item. After emailing, the seller stated that the mail is sometimes slow. I will not purchase from this seller again."
3,Why this title?,"This is an interesting story about a young man from New Bedford who reluctantly joins the marines during the War of 1812. He serves his time on an American ship engaged in destroying the English whaling industry in the Pacific. The story tells of appointing men to positions of authority based on family connections, rather than experience and ability. Why the author choose this title is very puzzling as the story has no connection to Marblehead's well documented role in the War of 1812. The author refers briefly to the ship captain's hatred of the English because Hessian mercenaries, hired by the English during the Revolutionary War, ransacked the town, murdered residents, and enslaved the captain when he was a small boy. Anyone versed in Marblehead history knows that Hessians soldiers were never in Marblehead. No incident like this ever happened. It appears that the author capitalized on the town's name and it's real connection to the War of 1812 just to sell the book."
3,"Use your own styles""tribute""","Half of the songs sound pretty good but the other half seem to be sung in the note of drunk.... they are all mostly trying to sound like Rob Zombie and come short to having any of their own styles added. Its a nice cd to have if you just like Zombie and like other people doing their thing the their songs...but the over all, just buy the real Zombie."
3,Not bad coming from no-name bands,I'm a big WZ fan and can say this tribute doesn't really do the songs 100% justice. I know maybe 2 of the 13 bands on this CD and some of the songs are downright horrible. All-in-all not a bad CD....takes a couple of listens to start liking it.
2,It was different...,"For loyal White Zombie fans, it was something new to listen to. But, you can see why there was not much publicity about its release. Most of the bands mutilated the original version of the song. I would get this one, only if you are bored out of your mind and can't find the originals!"
2,Not too hollywoodian for my taste...,"John Goberman wrote about this score as being probably the best music ever written for a film, but I don't think so... Despite Prokofiev is considered by many a great 20th century composer, the music for ""Alexander Nevsky"" is quite boring and I get happy when music finishes its final tunes. I just can't stand to hear the 50 minutes! Ok, there are magnificent tracks like ""The Bttle on the Ice"", but definitely it's not the BEST score of all time... it's just another soundtrack, not better than ""Gone with the Wind""."
3,"Watered Down, but, Good version of Ayurvedic Massage","This is a good book for western masseuse. The clarity of writing, technique and photos are great! However, having studied ancient massage techniques from Kalaripayatthu masters in India, this is NOT traditional massage techniques taught in India.Having said that, this book is meant for westerners so tones down the tradition.Overall, good book."
5,ayurveda review,"I have not yet read through the book, but in skimming over the contents, it is quite informative and appears to be a great modality to follow swedish massage."
4,Very Nice JCPenney Sheets,"Beautiful, super soft sheets...with JCPenny Home Masterpiece on the tags. The outer packaging mey say Joseph Abboud, but the sheets do not. I still love them, and wouldn't be able to buy these sheets at JCpenny's for this price."
3,Sheets,I was very suprised. For the money they were very nice. I had herad the name Joseph Abboud before & knew that he cold be quite expensive. What I didn't like was the JC Penny tag on the inside of the sheet. The outside pagkageing said Joseph Abboud the tag attached to the sheets said JC Penny market place.I am satisified with the quality of the sheets & have ordered 2 more sets though.
2,... Incorrect Virtua Tennis,"For a game that claims to honor a great sport, Virtua Tennis is not! Where are the great talents of the women(Williams sisters)etc, Chang and all the others that should be included in the game so that the Game Player can have the challenge of playing men against women ,women against women and create a possibly superb game almost like NBA SHOWTIME! What a waste to have a female impersonate a male, especially, when there is no other choice! What a disrespectful act towards women, Chang and any one else that should be included!"
5,The Best Tennis Game Ever,This game has awesome graphics.The game play is simple but boost your level to expert and it will be hard dude. If your looking for a good game this is it.If you play this game you will just might get hooked to it.This game never gets boring.I've had this game for two months and it hasn't even got boring to me yet.The only time the game boring to you is because you beat everybody who has challenged you.
5,Best Tennis Game Ever,"This has got to be the best tennis game that i have ever played. The game is so easy to get into, the controls are nice and easy to get to grips with. The graphics are quite good on this game, and possibly thr best i have seen on a sports game for some time. The playability fot this game is great you wont be able to put it down especially when you play against your friends."
5,Great multiplayer game!,"I am not a tennis fan at all but when it comes to this game, I am always up for some Virtua Tennis. The career mode is pretty good. Win matches to get money so you can buy players, levels and wears that can later be used in normal and multiplayer mode. The multiplayer is the best! It is a four player game that is always fun to play. This is always an alternative for multiplayer. Get this game if you have a big family! IT IS DEFINATELY WORTH THE PRICE!!!I hope that this review was helpful to you!"
1,Most unrealistic tennis game I have ever played,"The graphics are great, but that is it. There are very few players. No women. Why? Jim Courier is supposedly the best player in the game! What a laugh. I would rather play as mario or toadstool. When you are playing doubles you might as well be playing with a braindead cripple. Your partner is constantly making horrible plays. The control is decent. It seems like you can never hit a lob back, yet in singles the computer ALWAYS smashes them back. They should have just taken the lob function out of the game as far as i'm concerned. It was fun for the first day or so. My advice don't buy this awful game!"
5,WOW!,"This game is a great tennis game , the graphics are amazing , is easy and is very real. I hope the Dreamcast version is going as well as in the Arcade Version that is bye"
5,"""ACE""","This game is one word, WOW! I cannot believe the detail on the faces and even you can see their teeth. The stadiums are amazing and look like the actual ones. The crowd is amazing too. The gameplay is great, players actually make grunts and such and actually walk in with their raquets. This as real as tennis will get. In doubles the players talk to each other. The modes are exhibition, where you can play singles or doubles and use up to 4 players. Arcade mode you go through a mini tournament and the players get tougher as you go on. Then the beauty of the game is the World Circuit Mode where you can go to famous tournaments like wimbledon, us. open, etc. and win big buck on the way. You can buy stuff with your money such as sports drinks, strings, raquets, and even more players, stadiums, and outfits. This is the best tennis game ever, and two words... BUY IT!"
5,As good as it gets,"This is a quick review. If you need details, check some of the other reviews.A truly fantastic game and simulation. Easy to play, hard to master (against the computer players as you advance thru ranks). We have had it a few weeks now and it only gets better. I am the Dad, and my daughter (9) and son (7) and I can't seem to get enough. This is what all Dreamcast sports simulations should be like. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!"
4,Awesome,"I thought this game was gonna be average. When I played it at my friends house, I was blown away. This game is sooooo addictive. One of the funnest games on DC for sure. You should buy it."
5,Virtua Tennis,"I really enjoyed this game at the arcade. My brother and I have gotten in heated matches and can't wait for the DC pre-order from Amazon to arrive. Being too old by videogame standards, I lose regularly to my bro in all fighting and sports game. The beauty of this game is that it's easy to pick up and play, yet simulates pro tennis in a fun way. There are no zillion combos to pull. Even I can play and have pretty decent games against younger players."
4,Sweetnicity,"I just bought this game today and overall it is a good buy. The only problem with the game seems to be that there are no tennis superstars such as Agassi or Sampras. Whats even worst is that there are no chicks, no Ana Kournikova! Otherwuys, even if you dont like tennis, this game is addictive and easy to play."
5,"WOW, TENNIS ANYONE?","VIRTUA TENNIS is the first game for this sport on the DREAMCAST, and i can easily say this is the best sports game so far. In less than a year the dreamcast has totally blown away the competition(my sony playstation & nintendo 64 live peacefully in my attic,R.I.P.)and in that time the beauty of it`s game`s has been amazing(see SOUL CALIBUR,NFL2K & NBA2K,ETC.),but this game takes the cake! The game allows up to 4 players to play against eachother,the graphics are truely amazing,the game takes only about 1 minute to get the hang of, the computer A.I.(artificial intelligence) is great and last,but not least, this game is the most addictive and fun time that you can have standing on two feet! Now what else could you possibly ask for? GO BUY IT,IT`S AMAZING!"
4,Addicting,"This game is pretty addicting, even with its flaws. You can find yourself stuck in front of it for hours before even realizing it. The graphics are A+. Usually, tennis games have the same player with the same moves (and different hair color). In this game, each player has their own signature move. Play as Kafelnikov or Courier, and you'll see the individual differences in each players strokes. Great detail.OK, the ""perfect topspin lob while diving on the court"" move gets old after a while, but you adjust to it after a while. My other gripe is, while fun, it doesn't play like tennis. It's more like...Pong. You get a lot of weird rallies and shots that just don't happen in the sport of tennis. Still...I guess I was hoping for more of a sim than an arcade game. Because it isn't a sim, it has less replay value than, say, a basketball or football sim. Still, it has its charms."
5,I'm speechless,"This game is a must have for Dreamcast. If you dont have virtua tennis and have Dreamcast you're NUTS! I'm not really of a tennis player, but once I played this i'm a fanatic. I start out playing one game and the next thing you know im playing 30! Its extremly fun to play with other people. Doubles are my favorite you could play that for hours...literally. Overall this is an excellent game and on a scale of 1-10 I give it an 11. Great job Dreamcast!"
4,Great Game,"So what makes tennis all of a sudden such a great sport? Virtua Tennis! Ok so I'm exaggerating, but still the game is great because it is so easy to pick up and get into right away. True, the game is sorely lacking in some departments (player choice, female division, etc.) but nothing can compare when it comes to what it does right.If you're a gamer who's into sim crazy things, then this isn't for you. But if you like to get into your games quickly, ditch the instruction manuals and just veg for a few hours on the couch, this is the perfect game for you. Great graphics, insanely quick pacing, short load times and good replay value makes this game a real keeper.Virtua Tennis is also a good multiplayer game. Why? It's easy to get into, you won't need to explain stuff all day, and the graphics help makes you look great when you play."
4,A Great Primer for Harrison Fisher's Art,"This profusely illustrated book is a great companion for the collector of Harrison Fisher's work or Edwardian graphics. Devotees of turn of the century costume will also find a wealth of source material in this book. Well written and researched, this is a great primer for the beginning collector."
5,The phone calls made this movie!,"I loved Scream and Scream 2. I liked them so much because of the way that the killer called his victims, that was just to cool. I hope that Scream 2 won't be the last Scream movie."
1,Keep your dictionary close by,"This book is a text book and not for the beginner! A group of us are reading it with the guidance of a pastor, and it is still very intellectual. The conversation it has evoked in our group is wonderful; and we are all anxious to meet the author next week. We have all grown from this experience, but don't try it alone unless you have some serious theology knowledge or a open-minded pastor to discuss it with."
2,Too self involved,"I found the main observations in this book fairly interestering. But overall I found his attitude to the locals fairly arrongant unless they happened to help his journey. If you read the book them you will otice a few pieces of information don't check out e.g. the first cane bridge that he walks on and falls through he describes the pieces of wood being 30 cm apart, however in the picture in the book you can clearly see in the photos taken by himself that the only space close to that is the hole he fell done the rest were closer to 10 cm. To be honest this book has stirred an interest in this genre but I will be looking for books by a open minded writer, unlike Mark Shand."
3,River Dog,I bought River Dog because I am taking a trip on the Brahmaputra River in India and hope to get some insight into my trip.
5,Excelent for learning to make silver jewelry,"Branson presents numerous creative techniques that require minimal tools making this a valuable choice for a cash strapped student. The instructions occasionally require a leap of faith, but the illustrations are clear. If you enjoy Branson you may also want a copy of Ben Hunt's book Indian Silver Smithing. Hunt's book has additional tips and tricks and wonderful drawings from his notebooks."
4,Works Fine,"+Easy to set up.+Acts as wireless repeater.+Supports two printer.?Does not have bi-directional support, but then again, no print server does.?Sometimes my printer says printing but never does. Not sure if this is the print server or the printer."
3,Netgear PS Spanish,"Este Print Server Inalambrico es fenomenal para solventar la falta de puertos en tu red y no sacrificar puertos fisicos de tu router, de entrada para que funcione correctamente debes hacerle un update al firmware, luego como usuario en español el cd de auto configuracion no ejecuta correctamente, mas adelante leyendo el FAQ del fabricante descubri que debes cambiar una configuracion reginal a (Usa/Ingles) para que funcione adecuadamente, finalmente logre conectar mis impresoras en la red pero lo unico que no logre hacer y el fabricante lo promociona es utilizar los 4 puertos del switch que trae incorporado nunca tomaron una direccion ip, no digo que no lo haga a lo mejor no vi alguna consideracion y por ello no me funciono"
1,Waste of time and money,"I've installed many devices on my network but this one takes the grand prize of being the most useless piece of junk ever. Trying to run the admin setup from my Vista 64-bit Dell was painful. It kept dropping the connection to the print server and to the network overall. My router is a Cisco/Linksys WRT300N so maybe having 2 different vendors can be a problem. I never got past configuring the ip address, which also gave me conflicts with other devices. This was a complete waste of my time."
1,Check Printer Compatibility,"I bought this server after reading the generally positive reviews not realizing that it has huge compatibility issues with a lot of printers. [...]They have a compatibility list and an incompatibility list. My printers were on neither and after a long tech support process learned that the printers are not compatible. They must produce this list through the experiences of customers like myself. Check the list, because a lot of state-of-the-art printers are not compatible with this print server and thus do not work at all."
1,Mac use,"This print seerver will not work with a Macintosh running the Leopard operating system, although. according to Netgear it might with system 10.4. Tried for hours with no luck so returned product. Best to use Airport Express, not to mess with any other print server."
4,This print server is much better than Linksys one.,"I first bought Linksys print server. My wireless computer can detect the Linksys print server but that print server can not recognize my HP all-in-one printer. Returned Linksys one and then bought Netgear. Netgear print server works very well. One small problem, from my experience, this print server can only be set up by ethernet cable, not directly through wireless. Which means you have to set up the print server first through Ethernet cable then unplug the calbe and switch back to wireless network."
4,"Works well, but BAD instructions","I bought this to use to wirelessly connect my Toshiba HD-DVD player to my wireless router. Also to use with an HP 1000 inkjet USB printer. Works well for both, but installation was a huge pain because of really poor installation Wizard. It has you first establish communication with a hardwire ethernet line, then you detect your wireless network, then you immediately get an IP address conflict message because you have the same device on your network wired and wirelessly and that is a no no. Trick is to simply disconnect the hardwire ethernet, but the Wizard does not tell you this. Dumb."
2,"Looks like a nice little print server, but may not work for you",This print server will not work with all kinds of common printers that you may have. I bought the unit to unhook a particular printer from a PC that it's hooked up to and make it a shared printer.The printer I wanted to hook up is required to be hooked up to a Windows PC to function. This is apparently a common configuration for a printer where much of the smarts to run the printer are in the PC (especially for cheap ones which was the case with the printer with which I planned to use this print server). Definately check out the Netgear support site to make sure that your printer will be compatible.You may be better off to just buy a new printer that has an embedded wireless print server. Printers keep getting more and more capabilities and the prices tend to drop as well. The printer manufacturers make the real money of the ink cartridges.
3,"doesn't support a lot of printers, otherwise works fine","Got this at Bestbuy, when I had to replace my wifi router. My HP 1020 laser printer doesn't work with it, but my Canon Pixma i4000r does. There is really no way to know if your printer is supported until you test it out. Netgear is too lazy to do the testing themselves.The HP won't print a test page. No error message, just doesn't do anything. I have read that the bi-directional communications are the problem.The Canon works fine from all 4 of my computers. There is an error message when the printer tries to send info to the computer. Far as I can tell, the print server doesn't support any of that info, like out-of-paper messages."
2,"It works, but not all the time","I bought the print server so I wouldn't have to keep my computer running all the time to access the printers or run upstairs to wake up the computer when printing. The server stays online for varying periods of time, but then has to be reset. Also, although it runs drivers for both my printers, it doesn't seem to support all features of the printers. I can no longer do automatic duplex printing on my laserjet."
5,Very easy setup - reliable so far...,"It took me less than 10 minutes to set up the WGPS606 on my home network (5 OS X Macs, 1 PC) using web-based configuration (http://198.162.0.102).The server quickly detected and connected to my existing wireless network. Signal strength of 65% (length of house & separate floors) gives us very good WAN/LAN connection speed. WEP encryption setup was simple.I was able to connect an Epson R200 to one of the 2 USB ports, and had that running well in only a few minutes.My advice: Ignore the Wizard setup option. Use the web-based option instead, and just refresh the DHCP on each computer that you hang from the switch. It's that easy."
1,Do Not Buy This,"I was on Amazon shopping for a replacement to this device.First of all, Netgear has it on its EOL list, meaning it's officially no longer supported.Secondly, while the product works well enough, the installation guides and tech support are terrible. Every time I've had to install this product, I have needed live technical support (mediocre as it was) to install as the software could not complete the task.Apparently, the policy at Netgear has changed so that any support more than 90 days out from purchase is billed at $40. So, yep, every time I have a glitch and need to reinstall I will have to shell out $$.Better off buying a different one. That $30 used switch will be $70 by the time it's hooked up and running."
2,Would be good but...,"I purchased one of these print servers because I've had good luck with Netgear in the past.The good:Comes with a network cable and 2 USB cables.The setup is easy to click through.The bad:This device does not support WPA2. Your options are WEP or WPA-TKIP. The most recent firmware update appears to be December 22 2005.If you are running a WEP or WPA-TKIP network this device would be perfect for you, but if you are running anything with a current encryption scheme you are basically out of luck."
1,Unhappy,"Product was difficult to setup and didnt come with complete instructions. Had to call tech support (India?) and after 30 min. on the phone was able to complete the installation. Unfotunately after all that work I discovered that my printer (Xerox) was one of the ""few"" printers not compatable with the Netgear wireless print server."
1,"frustrating set-up, ultimately didn't work","I thought this was a coll product because it supports multiple printers- that is if you can get it to work...I tried to install this with a linksys router and after 6 hour and trying EVERYTHING this piece of **** went back to the store. I completed set-up and printed a test page and then it stopped working. I followed all of the instructions, temporarily disabled my firewall, checked to make sure everything was plugged in, double and triple checked to make sure SSID and passwords and the MAC address filter was right, and it still wouldn't work. I have had similar problems with a Netgear router I had- comstant headache to get it to work just like this print server which is why i bought the linksys router...looks like i will be buying the linksys print server as well."
1,"They get money, I waste my time","I spent over a year working with their online tech support (which is awful) trying to get it to work, and after spending countless hours trying fixes that never worked they finally told me that it must be defective hardware. Of course, by then I'd spent so long working with tech support that the warranty was no longer valid. I wish they had just wasted my money instead of my money and my time. I don't recommend buying any NETGEAR product, and especially not this one."
1,Terrible,"I spent hours trying to get my computer to recognize this thing and was finally able to get it sort of installed, though I realized at that point that you can't scan from a multifunction device through it - you have to plug the printer back into the computer via USB to scan. I did this and then went back to wireless, only to find that it had corrupted the printer driver, so I had to download and reinstall a fresh copy of the printer driver to get the printer to work at all. After that I stopped using the print server and in the meantime switched internet providers and had a new router and wireless network. Today I decided to try the print server again with the new router/network, but I'm having the same problems with installation (it says it can't find the print server even though they are connected by ethernet cable and all firewall is shut down). I don't remember what fluke allowed me eventually to get past this problem last time, so I'm giving up and throwing it in the trash."
2,I really wanted to like this device...,"It looks great - sleek modern design and all. Straightforward and simple setup went smoothly. My need for this device was as a wireless ethernet bridge - I did not need or test any USB printer functions. Initially, it worked. I could ping into and through the device, and all seemed well.But after a short time, an hour or so, it would stop working. Connecting directly to the unit with a cable, its status screens indicated all was working, but no wireless connection would work. Rebooting the device would sometimes get it back on line, but several times only a complete reset and setup would get it working. I attempted various combinations of starting routers and other devices, but this unit never worked reliably.Maybe I just had a bad unit, but I returned it and got a Linksys WRT54GL router, flashed it with the open source Tomato OS and set it up as a wireless bridge. Works great - and costs $30 less."
3,Good Product,"I had hard time configuring my Lexmark E238 and Canon MP530. You could not configure this router alone unless you are an expert in this field. However, be careful the technical support is only for 90 days, and after that they charge 30 dollar per case or 1hr. Therefore, my advice is to write down the steps with the technical support person guides through so you could go to your notes for help later. This product really works for two printers. However, remember this router could only perform printing if you are having multifunction printers. What I was trying to explain is if you have fax, scanner or photocopier you could not use this features through this wireless router. You should manually plug in your computer to make use of the multifunction of your printer. Yet another thing to be careful is you need to run the printer softwares in all the computer as well as the computers need to wireless."
1,What a hunk of junk,"This thing is a joke. I can't yet tell you how well it works as a print server because its installation ""program"" is just outright total junk. I always like when hardware makes me look like a total fool at a customer's site.We expect better from a brand like Netgear."
1,Trash,"I have thrown it away, after I spent an evening trying to configure it.I have extensive experience with networking, both, at work and at home, but this thing defeated me. The user guide is totally useless. I had to google pver and over again, to find pieces of relevant information. Like, to even be able to connect it with cable, one has to reconfigure all his network, to make sure all IPs start with 182.168.0...This box ignores DHCP -- its IP is always 192.168.0.102, no matter what. Its wireless security is broken. And, in the end, it simply does not work. What a waste of money, and more importantly, time!"
2,Does Not work for All-In-One Printers,"Netgear cannot support all-in-one printers which have been on the market for years. This printer server will only support one way traffic. In order to FAX the driver software needed to read from the all-in-one. When you get Netgear Support online you find out that you might as well read the book. They can only tell you what is easily available.Otherwise, it is a pain to setup since you have to directly plug the box into the back of your computer before their software works. Even then their software failed to overcome a problem with VISTA that could have been worked around."
2,Beware it all depends on your printer.,"If you have a printer that's not on the Windows XP default driver list then good luck. I tried installing an HP 1315 (not exactly a scarce printer) and in order to get it to work you MUST install the printer on each computer, and have it set up as the default printer, BEFORE it can be installed using the server. This means, in my case at least, that the printer must be lugged to each computer to be installed first. Ridiculous. Why can't it simply download the drivers from an already existing install like any other network printer installation? I've got a trouble ticket in to Netgear support to see if they can fix this before I return the unit.This is really too bad because once it's working it's pretty good. I have it working on my main computer that already had the 1315 installed directly."
1,Utterly disappointing,"Long story short, (6 hours of frustration), this server did not work with our system. We have a brand new Pavilion HP Laptop and a 3 yr old printer. After two separate phone calls to tech support and many failed tries to get the software to work, I just gave up. I checked the compatibility of the printer with this product before purchasing, but was apparently misled."
4,Works great once your network can find it,"I would not have got this thing working if not for Hooper's review below. I too use MAC filtering and so I added the MAC address on the box to my list -- nothing. Then I remembered having seen something to this effect in the reviews here when I was researching the device. Once that was done, the rest worked flawlessly. Would have been nice if the installation documentation acknowledged this fact.To repeat: SHUT OFF YOUR FIREWALL and SHUT OFF MAC FILTERING on your router during the installation so that your network can find the device. Once you're installed, you can turn these back on. In my case, the wireless MAC address was the wired MAC address + 1."
2,Compatibility issues,"This server didn't work with my HP psc 1209 so you can chalk that up to the list of printers it doesn't work with. You can get the server set up but when you try to print to it the driver for the printer just dissappears, I thought it was a Windows 2000 issue because it kept happening to my work laptop but I tried to set up my home pc that had been printing to this printer for over two years and as soon as I tried to print it uninstalled my driver. Netgear didn't give any compatibility lists."
3,Good Hardware--nonexistant support,"I never got a response from Netgear, other than canned email saying they valued me as a customer--I got about 25 of those, but newer any contact--not even on-line chat! I finally solved my problem after searching microsoft KB--Needless to say I will NOT consider another Netgear product--perhaps I have been spoiled by the excellent support from Linksys and HP."
1,Sand Paper Would Be Just As Good,"Just received this unit. Did not expect anything real sophisticated but did expect something practical. It is just two pieces of abrasive material mounted onto plastic--you rub the CD between the abrasive. Two pieces of sand paper will do the same thing. I am returning the unit unused. Unfortunately, I am now stuck paying postage both ways. Don't waste your money or time on this item!"
4,Familar Strange,"As reviewer Kitsuki mentions, many of the tracks Mills reworks here were castoffs from other artists -- but oh what a cast of castoffs! Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, Michael Brook, David Sylvian, Paul Schütze, Harold Budd, Sussan Deyhim, Roger Eno, Graham Lewis, Hector Zazou, Clodagh Simonds, Thurston Moore and more. With friends like that, their trash is more interesting than most peoples' best efforts.This release isn't quite as successful as his other one, ""Strange Familiar"" since it includes a couple vocals and a broader variety of sounds or source materials. It is not as cohesive. There are however many moments to recommend it, not the least of which is a version of Syd Barrett's ""Golden Hair."""
4,Book of Dave - Will Self,"I enjoyed the challenge of making sense of the language of this book, a lot of which is dialogue written in an invented and phonetic version of the London cockney. I am a Londoner and much of my enjoyment related to my knowledge of London which helped make sense of this quite confusing book. The main premise of the story is chilling; the suppression and control of people through imposed doctrine; the complete suppression of women's rights and the dominance of a patriachal society. This is all wrapped up in story which moves between the present time and a future post-apocalyptic world. Not a page turner for the beach but definitely worth the effort."
4,the book of dave,interesting although the superficial relativities became a bit trite. always entertaininfg though
2,Dead On Arrival,"This watch was listed at a good price, but the deal went sour when the ""brand new"" watch arrived with a dead battery. It was easier to have the battery replaced than going through the hassle of trying to return the watch and wait for a replacement."
2,Will not recommend,"I was totally disappointed with this item. It is way too small for a teenager, the band does not look durable."
4,Casio watch,This watch arrived quickly and was as advertised. The strap was a little shorter than expected; it would have been nice to have that included in the description. But other than that I am very pleased; it was a great deal for the price.
4,The fuzzy philosophy of Quantum mechanics,"Omnes tries to recreate philosophy on the basis of the fuzzy notions of Quantum mechanics. Others try to force traditional philosopy on Quantum mechanics.What we really need is to rework a new philosophy into Quantum mechanics! Quantum mechanics is a very good mathematical theory with no real philosophy to back it up except as a demonstration of the fragile state of our most fundamental concepts (space, time, fields etc.).In 1905 Einstein came up with the new revolutionary theory of special relativity that resulted in a set of equations devised several years before by Lorenz. The equations were the same but with a new revolutionary meaning to explain it. We're still waiting for someone to do the same for Quantum mechanics..."
4,Good for coastal navigation,The compass works great. Nautical compasses are always read in numerical degrees- anything else would be worthless when navigating using a chart. The fact that this compass is easily removed is also a nice feature. Would buy again.
2,Weird Design,"I bought one and am sending it back. I was going to use this on a small powerboat and realized the compass marks only ""E"" and ""W"" and those are on top. Not easily visible unless the compass is mounted below your line of sight. Yeah, I know numeric degrees are used for chart navigation but in this boat I rarely do that, I just want to quickly verify my direction. Basic direction should have been more visible imho at line of sight, without looking down at the compass. Silly setup for a small powerboat, even sillier for a kayak which, I gather, is their intended audience.Nicely made though. And a slick mounting system."
1,Like watching a car crash....,"A morbid attraction to the dying words of a great writer that fails greatly here. Occasionaly there are glimpses of her past greatness but most of the book is full of nonsense such as like: ""I've never been pretentious."", ""Both of us are innocents"" (Refering to her 29 year old lover and her in her 80's (?)), ""I don't know how to add. All I know how to do is create.""This very short work is followed by an essay that has some insight but mostly it's serious prose that sounds weighter than it really is. It is written by Christiane Blot-Labarrere who is (according to the book) ""among the very few whose writtings were respected by Duras.""This is the type of book many creative writting students are writting and it is an example of why many intellgent readers do not read ""serious books."" Pick up the Lover instead to see this woaman's greatness."
5,Classic jazz from a classic sax player & Guitarist,"this album represnts pure music. It is not embelished with unnecessary instrumentation. I highly recomend this to any one who digs Brubeck, or Progressive jazz in general."
4,Well written.,"I have very little use for Klingon ""culture"", or most of what they call ""values"". So it amazes me more than a little that I can actually enjoy a book written about Klingons, featuring almost nothing but Klingons, and lionizing their culture, attitudes and behaviors. I suppose that some of that is due to the fact that almost the only ""value"" that Klingons and I share is honor, and this book focuses on the lengths to which an honorable Klingon will go to defend that honor. But while I did enjoy reading this book, I can't in good conscience recommend it for anyone who isn't a fan of Klingons."
5,progressive mixing at its best !!!!,"This is by far one of the best progressive mixes for the year. Awesome tracks and smooth mixing! There are hundreds of DJ's out there and doesn't take much talent to spin. A real DJ has the ""EAR"" for good music and knows how to keep the crowd dancing. If you enjoyed other mixes from such DJ's as D:FUSE,Deep Dish or Stephane K and john creamer,you'll love this cd!"
3,"Interesting, but not very practical.","This book is interesting from a historical perspective. Those who think Christians didn't ever practice magic really should read it, because it has archaeological proof that Christ and his disciples did create talismans and amulets. Other than the historical reference, this is not of much practical use, since most of the tablets and scrolls they found spells on weren't intact, and you can't exactly find many of the ingredients nowadays."
1,I'm glad you warned me!!!,"I'm glad you warned me about this volume 3 set being the same as season 2. This is false advertising as far as I am concerned. A deliberate attempt to mislead customers who think they are buying a gift or an addition to their own set. I think Amazon should take this issue to task and stop this false advertising.Thanks for the warnings. I usually check the reviews before buying things for this very reason. Reading reviews also saved me from buying the ""Hawaii"" DVD with massive scene cuts. Thankfully, I have the VHS with no cuts.This has also come up with ""The Egyptian"" DVD which was made in Korean and Chinese (I think) but no English made version. Always check the negative reports on all DVD's you purchase to determine if there are serious problems or false advertising.Like I said, Amazon should do something about this and make sure the Title of the Item Clearly includes details like this at the very top of the page where customers can't miss it."
1,Buyer beware,The Outer Limits volume 3 is the same shows as The Outer Limits season 2 dvd. Beware and do not buy both like I did.
4,Microsoft Publisher,I recently became an editor for our Gem & Mineral Club and put out a ten page newsletter each month. Publisher is wonderful and easy to use and has been a great help. I also use Publisher for making mailing labels for our members. I have found using the help feature useful and have found solutions to my problems. I like the clip art included and use it to make the newsletter more interesting.
2,We've Seen It All Before,"Billed as a modern remake of the wonderful 1950 French film. La Ronde, 360 turns out to simply be another in a long line of Six-Degrees-Of-Separation-type films (or perhaps, considering its global span, another in a long line of Babel-type films). Unfortunately, there is really no development of story or character, so all that is left of any interest in watching how the lives of the characters randomly intersect on an international scale. The cast is good, with the stand-outs being Ben Foster and Anthony Hopkins (who in a rather small role ironically does his best work in years), but at the end one is left with a big ""So What?"""
2,Should we fill in the blanks ourselves?,When a movie has a great cast we have a right to expect a movie to match. This didn't come close. It may seem interesting to create a story showing how lives interconnect etc. But the script in this movie just doesn't amount to much. The film aspires to be thought provoking and/or profound but I found it just provoking. Why did I waste the time. A few good scenes - Anthony Hopkins at an AA meeting etc. But overall I found this to be a pretentious flop.
4,An interesting way of telling a very classic story,"Brilliantly acted, the film offers vision into the lives of many. There is no plot line in particular but this should not dissuade you from watching. It's worth it and the views of Paris, London are a nice touch. It you like explosions and violence this is not for you. This film tells a basic, age old story in a myriad of ways."
2,Boring,Billed as an Anthony Hopkins movie but he's been religated to a minor character. At least I think he was. I'm not sure because I fell asleep.
5,Great Story Line,Good Movie. I knew if Anthony Hopkins is playing it must be good. It is a good story line. Deff. recommend to watch.
1,Bad Choice,"The movie was quite confusing jumping from one thing to thenext, without quite finishing the first thing. It just really didn't make any sense . there was no point to the whole movie. I thought that with the stars in the movie:Anthony Hopkins, and The Constant Gardener chick, it would be great, great disappointment is what it was."
3,Good acting and predictable,"I lime the cast and the acting was pretty good, but the movie was predictable and just average at best."
3,360,"I rented this movie with no prior knowledge about it...just wanted to take a chance on it since Amazon is providing these movies before they're in the theaters. Got it based on the names of the actors in it. It was actually pretty good. A little slow moving in places, but liked how the story went 360. There were some subtitles to read, but not too many. I thought it was interesting and could lead to some good discussions after the movie.360 (Theatrical Rental)"
2,I missed the whole point!,"I did not understand much about this movie, it certainly is not what I thought I was going to be looking at."
3,Good movie,"It was a good movie, not a lot of action slow starting. Not what you would expect from anthony hopkins."
2,Anthony Hopkins Only Highlight of Movie,The story line is as simple as the title.. the circle of life. It bounces between all of the characters lives and how they intertwine. Not one I would add to my personal collection.
2,Replacement air filter,Filter does not meet expectations for a Carrier replacement and does not equal advertised picture.Filter is poorly assembled and flimsy in construction. Filter media is not glued or fastened to filter box which allows air to bypass filter media.
2,Filter doesn't fit,"I bought filters that are supposedly the same size as the ones in my furnace, and it turns out they are about 1/4 inch too wide to fit in the filter slot. I can't modify the slot, and I can't force the filter in without completely destroying it. I made the assumption, which has worked for several years, that the exterior dimensions would be standard. On the plus side, it had foam sealing strips pre-installed top and bottom. I haven't contacted the manufacturer yet, which I will try to do."
1,Incorrect dimensions listed,The dimensions for the filter purchased were listed incorrectly and no where on the actual filters does it say they are a replacement for the model number listed.
5,Great book...very interesting!!!!!,"This book was very interesting. Easy to read and had great examples and suggestions! We have just started the enzymes for our 4 year old daughter, pdd-nos. So far they have helped with her consitpation!! :)"
5,"Great book, easy to understand and very helpful","I wish there would of been a book out like this 5 years ago, Karen DeFelices book Enzymes for Autism and other Neurological Conditions is great and I have found so much valuable information.Having a child with Autism I understood her struggle and need to find anything to help her children. The book is so well written and I am so grateful that she was able to write about her struggle and her findings and put them into a book that everyone can understand..I am able to now go to my daughters doctor and go over different approaches I feel will benefit her..Thanks Karen for the wonderful gift you gave to many.."
3,OK,Wasn't exactly what i was expecting but for the price it is ok. i was hoping for more versions of the Bible. Also i had some trouble using it on windows 7. thanx
3,Trails Off,"I have to say that after the first song, Richter Scale Madness, I was a little disappointed with the CD. I purchased this CD while waiting for their 2002 release (Source Codes..)and I hope their new CD is better. The sound engineering was weak, and the songs sound like an amped up version of Pink Floyd's The Wall with it's psychodelic vibe."
5,my grandpa is Scotty McDonald,I thought that it was a very good book because my grandpa is scotty McDonald and i never got to see him cause he died in 1970's i m only 15 so it told things about him i never new.

3,Cilea Adriana Lecouvreur DVD Arthaus Musik 101497,"I have viewed the DVD of ""Adriana Lecouvreur"" and I found it quite well done, on the whole. The main singers were quite competent. I especially liked the lead tenor (Maurizio - Marcelo Alvarez), Adriana (Micaela Carosi), Michonnet (Alfonso Antoniozzi) and the Abbe (Luca Casalin). They all had well focused intonation without excessive vibrato and had good quality. I thought that Alvarez, with his ringing Italian tenor voice, was exceptionally good in his role. I was somewhat less pleased with the princess (Marianne Cornetti), whose vibrato was somewhat wider and not always centered right on the actual note. However, she seemed to improve as the Opera proceeded.If you don't insist on Pavarotti, this recording will be a fine addition to one's Opera collection.Ted Wilks"
5,Book product review,"The book arrived quickly and in good condition- packedwell. Enjoyed the book very much. One of Nora Roberts early books. I thought I had read them all- but missed this one, evidently. Delia and Marsh'sromance did not look like it was made in heaven at first. They seemed to iron out the their differences that got in their way of making their relationshipwork."
2,Not up to scratch!,"Considering it is about the Presa and not your average large dog breed, this book lacks information which is relavent to owning a Presa. The Presa isn't the same as a Rottweiler or dobermann, but reading this book would lead you to thinking that they are. The Presa has much more potential to be aggressive towards people and animals than your average large dog does, but there is no meantion/indication that this is so. Manuel Curto (author) is just premoting his Presa breed with out actually providing IMPORTANT information that should be known to every one considering the purchase of a Perro de Presa Canario."
5,Legendary,"This is the legendary first Duffo album, coming after Jeff Duff quitted Australia for England, leaving his prog-jazz-rhythm-rock band Kush behind him and starting all over again with a solo career. All songs penned by Duff himself. It has a punk sensibility, but an extraordinary classical musicality as well."
2,Very difficult to use,"I used to have a nice, simple pushbutton lock, but I lost the extra key. This thing is way too hard to insert into the locking slot, and once inserted it is way too hard to lock. I'm highly underwhelmed."
2,Myeh....,"I bought this book hoping it would shed some addl light on the last few days of the nation of South Vietnam as the author had seen it from a unique position. Mostly it was a biography of the author's adult life - dropping out of college, joining the army, servin in VN as both an infantry officer and a CIA case officer. The last few days of S. Vietnam - even from his perspective - ended up only the last few chapters of the book and were pretty blasé stories at best.If you're looking for exciting stories of VietNam and its fall, there are better more interesting books out thee than this one."
5,History and much more.,"This book is a great read. Time and money well spent. I recommend it to anyone who likes to read, from the casual reader to the book a day aficionado. The historical record is unique and interesting, eye opening for the regular citizen and detailed for the war buff. The look into human nature, motivation, and interaction is insightful, especially as it deals with people under significant stresses. While the history will fade into the past as time distances us from the Southeast Asia experience, the other elements of the book ring true today and will always be of value. This is a book all readers will enjoy and learn some lessons about people and their behaviors. It deserves five stars.J. Kirst"
1,Wouldn't believe anything from this author,"Kee MacFarlane is the social worker who's incompetant interviewing techniques led to the fiasco of the McMartin trial (the longest, most expensive trial in American history that produced no convictions & lots of bad publicity for child abuse cases around the country)."
2,Not a true fit,"Although this is the item the manufacturer, it was not the same gear shape as the original and made the mixer extremely LOUND. The Whine make it impossiple to use without ear protection. I do NOT recommend buying this gear."
4,as needed for repair,Got the part to repair my Kitchen Aid pro series mixer. It was shipped quickly. Fit perfectly. Mixer runs fine again!
4,"Experimental, a little less ""poppish"" than Girls Can Tell","I recently saw Spoon in concert though I was a bit apprehensive after listening to this album. Don't get me wrong, this is an complex, textured album, it's just more on a bit of a downbeat than Girls Can Tell. I was pleased that most of the songs they performed were off their previous release. Kill the Moonlight, like its title suggests, is a little darker, a little more esoteric. This is the Spoon album meant for popping in your CD player when you want to lay back, stare at the ceiling, and contemplate."
3,what kind of fool --,"compares spoon to pavement? man -- unplug yr. damn ears! you get paid to write reviews?!?!?! -- hook me up with your publicist, i need a gig -- having said that, this album is pretty good but not as good as GCT -- i've seen them play live a couple of times in the past, perhaps a better live band than studio, or maybe my opinion was overcast by beer clouds -- who knows? regardless, i first picked up 'a series of sneaks' years ago in a bargain bin before all the hoopla surrounded this band -- they kind of re-invented themselves, and listening to the earlier stuff, yr. ears will tell -- all told, a solid band, but nothing earth-shattering, and certainly NOTHING like pavement (and believe me, i loooooove the pavement, especially after a hard night of drinking) --"
3,All Aboard the Gravy Boat,"The song kicks off with a rambling, a rambling which is good, a rambling which to you may not be a rambling...rather perhaps a click, or a snap, or a Blamo. This good rambling goes on for a bit too long and begins to turn me off. The second song comes in and its like i'm in heaven strumming a heavy metal guitar that was meant for rocking, and that is just what this album does is rock. its got almost a jazzy chord progression, simple yet complex. does its job for that night where your Linkin Park cd just doesnt cut it anymore. And this is where my ADD kicks in and I don't finish reviewing.... good day"
2,Empty,"A friend of mine turned me on to Spoon, and at first I listened enthusicatically... but then I got bored. Although Spoon's songs may be catchy at times, they are empty and deviod of any alterations. The same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so, but in the end I don't think I've ever listened to an entire track. If this is 5 star music today, our culture is severely lacking depth."
4,Better and Better,"Actually, I am not too sure if I like this album better than the last one, but that may change. Spoon tends to grow on you with repeated listenings. From start to finish this is a polished, yet emotional gem. But so cool and detached at times too. It is amazing what the guys can do now. Pavement references are not nearly as warranted as they might seem--think of the best rock songwriters with a modern bite and then you have it. This is an album that builds indie cred into classic rock, blending it into something melodic but raw. It is a triumph."
4,"Not Pavement, but better than Girls Can Tell","One hopes that as the discography of a band expands so does the quality of their recordings. Spoon seemed to learn from the shortcomings of Girls Can Tell and have given us a nice record. What is nice about Spoon is that they have a unique sound which is hard these days. At times they sound like the Kinks, Thin Lizzy and even Steelyu Dan. But, where grandiose over-indulgence ruined those 70's bands Spoon is much more reserved and willing to let the piano chop away against the back beat of the drums. This album certainly isnt perfect, but it is better than previous efforts and promises something better to come..."
1,"Reader from Saudi Arabia, March 8, 1999","This is the biggest book I read, however the least useful. The book spend so much time talking about things, however when it comes to examples, the book is no ware close to any reader expectations.The examples on the CD and the examples in the text are not related. Many times the book would start taking about something and suddenly the author would jump to another subject leaving the reader wondering what happened.There is no in depth information about basic elements or advanced of Access. New users of Access who want to become a sound Access developer will be very disappointed if they buy this book.I feel that the author made the book so big and divided it into many chapters to attract buyers and he got that.If you are developing an Access application, this is not the book you want to buy. Do not buy this book before seeing it and checking it out carefully otherwise you would be wasting your money and disappointed as I was."
1,Not much programming in this programming book,"I couldn't figure out who the audience for this book was. The first half of the book talks about things like forms and reports in a kind of general way, like the reader doesn't know anything about Access. Then the second half of the book is suppossed to be about code, but there is very little of it. What code there is is hard to understand unless you already have some VBA experience.This book was written by several different people and it repeats things, so they apparently did't know what each other were doing and it just makes the book fatter (over 800 pages) without adding real content.One good thing about the book is that it comes with a CD that has two complete books (among other things) on it. ""Teach Yourself ActiveX Programming in 21 Days"" and ""Visual Basic for Applications Unleashed."""
1,Do Not Buy This Book ??????,"This is the biggest book I read, however the least useful. The book spend so much time talking about things, however when it comes to examples, the book is no ware close to any reader expectations.The examples on the CD and the examples in the text are not related. Many times the book would start taking about something and suddenly the author would jump to another subject leaving the reader wondering what happened.There is no in depth information about basic elements of Access.

Do not buy this book before seeing it and checking it out carefully otherwise you would be wasting your money and disappointed as I was."
2,Not good programming Book!,"First of all, This book says many words but none of them is related to programming!. A few VBA code are replaced in the book. However , There are very beginer steps.If I were you , I would not buy this book!"
4,The first warrior elite of England,"This title examines the gear, tactics, training, and lifestyle of the elite warrior of the ancient and early medieval Saxon armies-the thegn. This book has the same author and illustrator as the Viking Hersir title, and resembles that book greatly."
4,Good reference source,If you're familiar with Osprey's work this book should be a familiar read. It's very concise and has several beautiful color plates. This isn't the full story of the Anglo Saxons or of Anglo Saxon England. It doesn't even cover the Burghs in great detail. But it does cover a lot of Anglo Saxon history and culture.
2,Book was a second.,"Generally a good book, but in my case it was part about the Anglo Saxons and partly about the Vikings. The entire colour section was substituted from their Viking title. So be sure you don't get one of the misprinted editions like I did."
1,Free at the Library of Congress Website,"The price asked seems absurd, given that the complete records are available for free at the Library of Congress website--just seach by title for ""Farrand's Records"" right on the website homepage, easy as pie."
1,Speed Racer mini remote control car,"THis toy did not work from the start. The battery was old looking and had leaked, it did not hold a charge! I would not recommend this toy!"
5,Good quality for the money,"I bought one for my 2 and 4 year old. They love it and I do too. The sound is good; It isn't a cheap kids toy, but it's priced so that if it gets missed placed for a while I won't fret."
3,Ok but with issues,The harmonica looks very nice but i found that one of the notes seems off and I for sure dont know how to tune a harmonica.
4,decent for seeing if you are serious about learning,"after about 5 hours of total playing time i think i blew out the 8th reed, and the 9th never sounded quite right. sounded great before the reed blew out and it was cheap which is why it gets a 4 star review instead of a 2. great for awhile."
3,Can't beat the price !,"I own 3 of these harps.They play nice, not perfectly tuned but they are great for practice and if you blow out harps like I do just toss it and pick up another."
5,Great Harmonica!,"I expected this to be a cheap toy, but it's great! The instrument came in a plastic case with a pink polishing cloth. There was a small chip in the plastic of the harmonica, which I can say is my only complaint. It sounds great otherwise, and is easy to learn!For slower learners, I recommend this website for a few tips:[...]"
4,You'd Be a Fool to Pass on This,"Subtle's For Hero: For Fool is the album legendary, innovative hip-hop producer J. Dilla would make if he found four like-minded musicians and formed his own indie/rock/electronic/hip-hop band. Put another way, if you liked the eclectic eccentricity of The Avalanches' Since I Left You, and can imagine that band with a lead rapper/singer, then you'd be foolish not to consider adding For Hero: For Fool to your album collection."
2,not so good,"I haven't had the chance to try other Arabic course books, but this one is lousy. It gives you phrases and doesn't tell you what they mean.It seems likes it's just thrown together. The introduction to the Arabic writing system is poor. Thankfully, I picked upThe Arabic Alphabet: How to Read & Write It, which gives you an introduction to the alphabet."
4,Wonderful foundation to learn Arabic,"I had taken a six week intensive course in Iraqi Arabic in the military a few years ago, and ordered this with the intention of refreshing and maybe adding to what I knew. This course, like most of the ""Teach Yourself"" courses is wonderful. It works to provide a solid foundation before moving on to actual phrases. It's so difficult to really get all the sounds in Arabic correct and the audio CD helps immensely with this. It would be even better if they offered a video DVD supplement, but I'm sure that's in the works. Lessons are very well organized and really allows you to learn at your own pace."
4,"Written for British English speakers, but still useful for others","This book is written for a British audience, so it may cause some trouble with pronunciation and understanding, unless you're very familiar with British English (as opposed to American English). Also, I don't feel like pronunciation is explained phonetically (the descriptions of the sounds are very informal and useless if you're used to using IPA). Otherwise this book has great review sections and each chapter builds on the previous one."
5,"LEARNING HOW TO SPEAK, READ AND SPEAK ARABIC AT EASE","HiBeing a non arabic speaking fellow, i sincerely found the book to be a companion in learning how to read, write and even speak arabicM.M. Abubakar"
4,Much improved 2nd edition!,"As a fan of the Teach Yourself series, I was disappointed with the 1992 version of this course. The text followed an awkward path; surprisingly un-conversational relative to other TY courses, and the recordings were simply uninspiring.I picked-up the 2002 edition a couple of months ago and have found a much improved, completely re-written text featuring quick, relevant dialogues, a better print layout, adequate explanations of usage particulars, and more lively audio recordings.Arabic is not an easy language to learn without extensive audio recordings. Unfortunately, the Pimsleur series has yet to produce a decent standard Arabic course. I recommend Rosetta Stone or Transparent Language Arabic software, but if these are not available to you as learning resources, this edition of Teach Yourself Arabic seems adequate for the more-convenient book & cassette approach."
2,Not good for beginners,"This book has a lot of good things except it is more constructed as a class text book than a teach yourself book. The tapes are okay, but I wish it was longer. This book DOES NOT have phonetics written out to help the user pronounce the words. The examples are written in Arabic and you will have to decifer what it means by remembering what the Arabic letters sounds like. In other words, the book does not have examples of how to pronounce. You will have to learn the pronunciation of the alphabetics and put it together to form or read words. It wasn't easy for me because I could have been doing it all wrong and wouldn't even know it. The tapes can sometime be hard to mimick because with every language there are always something you are missing when speaking. I would only recommend this book to someone who is somewhat already familiar with the Arabic language, not a beginner who have never been exposed to Arabic."
3,It's not what I hoped for,"It's far too difficult for a light approach - you really have to want to learn Arabic for more than just a vacation trip. My own fault, though, since I just assumed it would be more suitable for my needs."
5,Retrofuturistic jazzpop,"I went to Hanne's concert in Barcelona without knowing what I would listen to. When the music began, I discovered that I was listening to a very talented woman, with a beautiful voice, and a creative soul with a lot to offer to the audience. Her retrofuturistic jazzpop is very close of that of Robert Wyatt, for example. If you know what I am talking about, you can imagine the quality of her music. Make yourself a favour, buy this LP!"
2,Good Video!,Video was not a new release as I had hoped but a repackaged video from The Walk Slim Series with a Pedometor added. Not sure what the pedometor has to do with the video. This is a good workout and you will really feel it all over. Lots of cardio - good for weight loss goals
2,Just an older dvd repackaged,"BEWARE-This set is just Leslie Sansone's ""Walk At Home Walk Slim - Fast Start 1 & 2 Mile Walk / 3 Fast Miles (2-DVD)"" repackaged with a pedometer. Needless to say I was disappointed when I opened the box to find a DVD I aleady owned and then had to mess around with sending it back. With that being said this is one of her better programs so if you do not already have this DVD it is worth adding to your collection."
5,Walk Away the Pounds.,Leslie Sansone is energetic and this workout seems to work. The pedometer works well and seems to be consistent. This workout is varied and provides a new way to enjoy walking in your home.
5,Fantastic band,This is a fantastic cd. Starfish was so great. They were awesome live. This cd is their finest stuff. Kliffordave and Weeding Out are some of the best songs on this cd.
4,Now if only he'll do the dishes,"Bought for hubby as a gag stocking stuffer. He loved the set, hung them on the stainless fridge. They look great, but probably will never touch a dish. Very attractive."
3,Cute. Rent it. Maybe buy it.,"Three stars should be considered pretty good. Everyone is looking for the blockbuster, the hit. What about a nice film?This is a nice relaxing film to enjoy on a week night or perhaps on a date. It's interesting fun and not really predictable. The story takes unexpected twists and turns and that is much appreciated in this world of formula driven plots. The ensemble cast is fun. There are discoveries to make about each character and I think you will find this would be a nice film to sit back and enjoy with a glass of wine. Cheers."
5,Great Film!,"I saw this movie in a theater in New York and LOVED it! Fantastic direction and cinematography, a really solid cast, great heart, and a ton of fun."
2,"Boring,bORING, bOORING",There is never a hardy laugh or anything else I saw in this movie(except for a beautiful little Lake and the thought of going fishing with them--but you have to take their word for it that they went fishing) that made it worth watching. I feel sorry for anyone with the life of these characters. They showed a struggle to get through the boring dialect---as if they couldn't wait for it to end--know I couldn't! STEER CLEAR OF THIS ONE!
4,"Not a great recording, but competent and insightful","This is probably not a revelation like those of Tureck or Gould, but it is competently played, with spirit and some imagination, sound is of a good quality. A pleasure to listen to. I don't think that one is likely to be stirred and shaken by Jando's genius, but such things are rare, anyway. I would not probably pay a full price for this CD. However, given its budget price, it is certainly a worthwhile addition to a Bach collection. Modestly recommended."
4,Great Game!,"This game was great. MTV has really has outdone themselves. This game was by far much better than Tony Hawlk Pro Skater. The graphics were excelent, and the courses were great too. This game is for everyone especially the skateboarding lovers. PLAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!!"
3,Not what I expected,"This game was definitely not what I expected. I thought it would be just as good as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, but I was wrong. This game was boring, and didn't keep my attention for more than 10 minutes. This game is now sitting in a box in my room never being used. The one good thing about it was the graphics."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,I bought this game and it is boring no graphics and doen't work right. I returned it on the SPOT!! don't waste your money on it It is the worst game on GameBOY!!
3,Lisle 36500 Ridge Reamer,"Ridge reamer worked as advertised. ""O"" ring broke after one engine task. Company should ship product with a spare ""O"" ring."
1,964 PU,"10 minutes of poor writing stretched to 97 minutes by bad acting with a 90 minute sound track of grunting, screaming, and gagging. Like getting on a bad ride after a bad meal. When it finally stops you still don't feel well and you regret wasting your time and money. I don't know what drug cyberpunks are on to enjoy this but thank you, I'll pass."
4,Sci-Fi Fan's Review,I have enjoyed ALL of Anne McCaffrey's Sci-Fi's but I have learned that her occasional forays into other genre are refreshing and mind opening. As always her characters are well developed to the point that they seem like old friends and the story is well told and captivating from the first chapter. Even if you only read SF you'll like this book
4,Loved it,"My sister talked me into reading ""The Lady"". I don't read! I bought copy's for friends that is how much I liked it. You have to know english riding to get the full story. I love my horse and may mock hunt. Glad the author took a chance and wrote out of her norm (si fi, I think). Whish there was a Lady II, end seemed a little rushed."
1,Super small,Its super small and wish I could return it. looks like a good watch for a 10 year old. Does not look like the picture!!!
1,TOO SMALL!,"I was very disappointed with the size when I got it in the mail. I had originally got it for my boyfriend, but the watch looks silly on his wrist! It's just too small! It even looks small on my wrist! This would be great for any kids under the age of 10, but I suppose you get what you pay for.The strap isn't shiny like in the photo. It's a matt black, made of rubber / resin and seems very fragile. Definitely double check the measurements or you'll end up disappointed like me!"
3,Way Small,"The watch is wayyyy small for my wrists, so it just doesn't look right to me. The strap isn't too small, just the watch itself. I'm sure it keeps good time and it looks cool, just not when on a wrist. If you want a watch the covers the majority of your wrist, don't buy this watch."
3,Small watch,This watch is a lot smaller than i it would be. The clock face is about the size of an American silver dollar coin. This can be good or bad for you depending on your preferences.
3,Functional watch,"Gift for my husband. It's a ""functional watch"" according to him. Doesn't like the plastic band - they sweat. One thing that's nice is that it is thin and has a low profile on his wrist. It's also readable without his glasses!Good watch for the price."
1,Piece,You get what you pay for. Extremly cheap and poorly made watch. Looks cheap and poor as well. I'm actually suprised that it even works.
1,Band length MENS,"Reason for the one star, I don't have a Casio watch. Reason two: Nearly all watch manufacturers state the length of their watch band. Timex and Casio flatly refuse to do so. Reason: UNKNOWN. Several e-mails to them remained without an answer. How can they estimate that each and every mens wrist circumference around the world is the same? This is a cheap customer-be-damned attitude from a well known company. They better learn from their Chinese counter parts. Yes, I like to buy American but how? No Casio for me."
3,YOUNG MONEY BRICK SQUAD,This watch is pretty cool looking. A little smaller than I anticipated but they have the measurements in the picture so I probably shouldve looked at that. I found the same watch at Target for $19 so it's definitely a good deal. A lot of people say it only lasts a month. I've only had it a few weeks so I havent had any of those problems.
2,Is this for a Child?,"This is a very simple watch which is what i wanted but when i got it, it looked like it was made for a child"
5,family album a hit!,"The Grateful Dead Family Album by Jerilyn Lee Brandelius is the ideal book for anyone who loves the musical heaven, and cultural influences that the grateful dead brought us. You open the pages into a vivid world that shows how amazing this era was. There are thousands of pictures in this book: wavy gravy; mickey hart; phil lesh; JERRY GARCIA; stanley mouse; rock; mountain girl; bill legate, and hundreds of other recognizable faces. Jerilyn Brandelius writes short paragraphs telling stories of these great times, the causes the Dead supported, the concerts they threw, there tours around the world, and many more stories. This is a book that anybody who loved this era and the Grateful Dead, MUST HAVE!"
3,Fun Read,"This is #7 in McAllister's Code of the West series. The story takes place (before AND after) the romance in #8, The Cowboy Crashes a Wedding, which is one of her best.I love this author, always good for a feel-good quick read. The characters were likeable, and it was easy to care about their happiness.Enjoy."
4,What would you do to fit in?,"Excellent indie film reversing the idea of a gay guy trying to fit in with his majority straight community. When you think theatre community, what comes to mind? After cravats? There you go. This film follows a straight burgening actor as he struggles to fit in with his majority homosexual theatre community.I'm not going to go into more detail - just watch it. But to pick out favourites, the score and sound track are great, and the 'Ernest' insert adds a hilarious sureality.In all, have to say you need to get this film. Now. Go on."
4,Great Fun,"This is one of those gay indie films that is nothing but fun. It's got drama, drag queens, cuties and camp. What more could you ask for!"
5,Roland likes,This is one of my fave films of all time. It's seriously funny you guys. I bought this based on a recommendation from my cousin Peter. Peter may be functionally retarded but the goofy bastard sure knows his indie--fish-out-of-water--gay--comedies.
3,Decent,"Well, not the best movie or storyline out there, it was just weird overall... should have bought something else, or maybe something interesting..."
2,Not quite a good cup,"Update 8 months after purchasing - I just threw this cup out. It is very sturdy with a pretty good design but it's just too difficult to open and close. My son can't open the lid and my husband passes it to me because I bought the thing. Otherwise I liked the cup but I'm just tired of all the effort it takes to use.Original Review - This is a large cup that is well made. The straw is very wide and hard plastic, making it perfect for a real smoothie with a few chunks of berry. Not easily spilled. The lid is difficult to get on and off (my 9 year old can't do it). I might buy this again."
5,awesome,"Very stylish. Spill proof. Top screws on nicely. I like that there is no need for a gasket, I have another one that has a gasket and it makes it harder to clean."
2,Where is my straw???,I was so excited for this cup... only to find that the straw did not come with it! I need the straw!
2,"Ok cup, but straw was missing","I ordered two of these cups. They were shipped seperately (seems odd). One arrived with the straw, the other didn't. When I emailed to ask for them to send me the missing straw, they offered for me to return the cup (a hassle) or they would refund me $1.50 (yippee - now I have $1.50 and a cup with no straw). It's unfortunate that the cup came with no straw, but I understand that things happen. I'd be fine with it if they could just send me the darn straw."
4,"A cool drink, in a cool cup","This cup was purchased for two reasons. The first was to encourage me to drink more water throughout the day and the second was to keep me from spilling.This cup is now a permanent fixture on my desk at work and gets refilled on average 3-4 times a day. It keeps my water cold for over an hour which is plenty of time for me to drink it down. And I haven't had a spill, which is more than I can say for the months previous to buying this. I have spilled more than one FULL cup of water or coffee across my desk, which isn't so much fun to clean. That alone was worth the cost of the cup! Oh and mine did come with the straw.If you are considering buying this, it does come in several colors AND it is currently on the 4-for-3 promo so find a couple more items and save a few more dollars at check out.Copco Cold Beverage Mug, Purple JacksCopco Cold Beverage Mug, Pink Butterfly/DaisyCopco Cold Beverage Mug, Lime Spiral"
2,Great if you don't use it for a smoothie,"The problem with this travel cup is that it is VERY difficult to clean if you drink smoothies from it. There are multiple nooks and crannies, including areas where two pieces of plastic come together that form a seam with a space for food to collect. I find it very difficult to clean and I'm not running the dishwasher to clean it every time I use it. If you just need something for tea, coffee, juice, soda (pop), or other cold drinks then I'm sure it will be fine. I'm going to toss it and get one that I can use for smoothies and is easier to keep clean."
5,BEST COLD CUP !!,"THIS IS THE BEST COLD CUP EVER MADE, WE TAKE THEM ON VACATION TO THE ALL-INCLUSIVES, YOU NEED THEM TO KEEP THOSE FROZEN DRINKS COLD WHILE LYING BY THE POOL .........LIFE IS GOOD !!!"
4,Fine for me,"I use this cup for water on the nightstand at night. I like the design because its true: it does not spill as easily as the other Copco cups that I have many of. Drawback: its also not as big as the other Copco cups, but its fine for my needs. I was also disappointed the straw is not dishwasher safe like my other Copco cups-and I learned that the HARD way. Nevertheless, regular disposable straws work just fine with it too."
5,Excellent condition,I received this product in very good condition in a padded envelope. The quality of this product is excellent.
3,Warning: May be the Single Disc Version of Fight Club!,"This set looks like a great deal: the dual disc version of Fight Club, plus a Jet Li movie for a few more bucks.I was a little skeptical, however, and looking at some other websites, I found that the picture showed the single disc version of Fight Club, not the dual disc as pictured here. It is uncertain which the set actually contains at this point, so buyer beware."
3,Reviewer Below Was Right!,"I wanted to get fight club and I wasn't THAT interested in the special features on the second disc, so I just decided to get this set and post whether the first reviewer was right. He is correct. The Fight Club/Kiss of the Dragon set includes the SINGLE DISC version of Fight Club. Hope this helps someone out. I only gave it three stars because fight club is a great movie but I haven't seen Kiss of the Dragon yet."
2,Hardware problem - massive number of interrupts,"I bought this card bundled with the matching router. The router works just fine but I when I tried to use the card in an XP portable (UK Evesham) it produced a massive slowdown in the PCs performance. The CPU utilization went to 100% whenever I plugged the card in. Using SysInternals process monitor showed that 50% of the CPU was being chewed up by Hardware Interrupts, and the rest by deferred procedure calls. So something was very wrong.It may be because there were 2 wireless routers within range, one a LinkSys and the other the NetGear both oeprating on Channel 11.Whatever the reason, it was unusable."
2,INTERMITTENT CONNECTIVITY,"This may be a great card, but I have had to reinstall the drivers twice because it would not connect to the web via the Netgear Router.Now I am receiving a message that this is not a digitally registered copy of the drivers, whatever that means.We have two other cards on older Macs from the old ""Airport"" system which are trouble-free compared to this card.Maybe its my computer, but this has not been a favorable experience for me!"
4,CORRECTION OF RESPONSE;,"RESPECTFULLY''I would like to take the time to correct a response/statement/review...after some difficulty with communication I would like to say how impressed I was to find this sellers willingness to help and accomadate (forgive my spelling)me with fixxing any difficulties I was haveing w/my order..so please forgive my abruptness,forgive my negative review,...ect.they were even kind enough to attempt to call me(I am in the mountains of northern california and cellular service is equally difficult up here)toI believe see what could be done to assist me.as a wounded veteran I respect and am pleased for the efforts.all my best---->1stLtntKenney E.Sills O-2"
4,Makes this old laptop worth saving...,Made an old Toshiba laptop worth holding on to..surfs Internet fine and easy to install.
2,"It works fair, but, not good enough to the claims....","1. Setup was a pain. It's connected to my router, but, got a wrong IP address which seemed to have been known for a while per the website of the manufacturer.(why don't they do something about it!).2. Technical support is useless. I talked to a couple of folks in Philipines(nothing personal to the country), but, they're just interested in log in collecting my personal information without providing any value-added technical solutions. Typical cheap call center. I felt like talking to a wall and listened to a recorded information.3. The range and the speed are not good at all!!!4. I don't recommend at all."
3,it does extend range if used with a range-max router or wap -- but it's not spectacular,"Yes, it does ""work"". Meaning if you get the RangeMax router or wireless access point, the pair of them do give you better range than (for example) a Netgear WGT624 router with a WGT511 card (and other such combos that I've tried). It's a bit erratic -- the signal level fluctuates, which seems to me to be a software (algorithm) problem. I hope they can improve it further, but for now it's meeting my needs.A bit more detail: I have a large house, and the networking stuff is all at one end (never mind why), so at the other end of the house the wireless signal would fade to nothing. With this RangeMax combo I can now get an adequate signal (2 bars) where I used to get nothing.So don't expect too much, but also don't be daunted by the bad reviews, it's worth a try. As you know, every building is different, so as they say in another context, your results may vary."
3,Not versatile enough,"The barbell is fine, but it comes with 2- 8 lb plates, 4-10 lb plates, and 2-20 lb plates. Instead of a set 10 lb plates I wish they included 2-5 lb and 2-2.5 lb to make it more versatile. I had to go and purchase these extra plates while one set of 10 and 20 lbs are rerely used."
3,too short for weight bench,ordered this one because it showed that other people purchased it with the weight bench i had ordered. the problem is the bar is not long enough to fit on that bench so i ended up having to buy another bar be sure check length of bench before ordering
2,LMAO IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY,THE ONLY REASON WHY I GAVE THIS ITEM 2 STARS WAS BECAUSE IT LASTED FOR AT LEAST A MONTH WAS AMAZING IN THE BEGINNING BUT ONCE I ADDED 10 POUNDS THE TWO SIDES BENT DOWN SO NOW IT LOOKS REALLY FUNNY WHEN I BENCH OR SQUAT LOL. ONLY BUY THIS IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO LESS THAN 100 LB WORKOUT. ANYTHING MORE I WOULD BUY THE 300LB OLYMPIC SET SO YOU CAN HAVE ENOUGH WEIGHT TO BENCH AND SQUAT.
2,OK,Just OK. You will get a good workout but will need better equipment if you need a really good workout
2,Does NOT work with suggested weight bench pairing,"We bought this with the CB 729 Weight bench for my son for Christmas. As Amazon suggested, this weight set was part of a ""frequently bought together"" deal. Assuming that they would work together, I made the purchase. So while there is nothing defective about this product, it does NOT fit the suggested weight bench pairing (too short). We now have to disassemble, repack and pay for return shipping."
2,Disapointed,"Did not come with spring clips or user guide, weights had powdery dust on them. You get what you pay for, just looks and feels really cheap."
1,Very misleading for the beginner,"When you order the Competitor CB 729 Olympic Weight Bench the ""US Weight 100-pound Traditional Weight set is grouped with it giving you the impression that it is the weight set you should buy with the bench - IT IS NOT. I was fooled and misled. The US Weight 100 Pound Traditional Weight Set isn't event made for the Olympic Weight Bench. The weight bar is too smal, too short for the bench. DO NOT buy this weight set if you bought the Olympic bench... We bought it and cannot use it. Now we are ordering the CAP Barbell Weight Bar Standard 72"" threaded Bar. We believe this will work with the bench - based on the other reviews we've read of people being fooled like we were... We'll let you know. Quite complicated for those of us that ""Lift things up and put them down."""
1,Incomplete set,"The set came without the two locking spring clips!!! Amazon haven't answer my emails...Average quality, you get what you pay for..."
2,Incomplete,Bought this to give to my son for Christmas and put it away - don't. Recieved the box taped up on both ends and appeared to be okay. Now we have the weights and no baar because they sold us a returned item. They failed to check if someone had all of the items in the box and then re-sold it. Will not buy from them again.
1,Not worth your money,"Well, first of all, its a very heavy shipment. UPS tries to leave it outside for you to carry it by yourself. SO there is no point of buying online.Second, if you try to return a 100 ib box, if you dont like it, is nearly impossible.Third, the bar is very NARROW and weak for an olympic bench. that means useless for me, as I got it for a bench. So save your 60 bucks and spend it somewhere you will not end up just having something useless."
3,You get what you pay for ...,"This set is a very basic weight set. The weights are plastic and the bar has no weight on its own. It comes with 2 20#, 4 10# and 2 8# weights. When you start combining weights that is very limited. I am finding that being able to control increasing your weight by 2 - 5 pounds is much more realistic than going from say 20 pounds to 36 (adding the 8s). Ideally I would like to increase by 2-3 pounds per side not 8.I suppose adding the right weight sizes to this makes it better; but you can buy a higher quality set with the needed weights for around the same price to making this set work. Definitely not for serious weight lifters or those of us in progressive training. I have a feeling adding too much weight to the bar will cause it to flex too much."
3,US Weight 100-Pound Traditional Weight Set,The weight set is decent the only thing that i didn't like was that no 5 pound weights are included so i had to buy those seperate otherwise the weight set is fine
2,this is not a good product,"The bar comes in two segments. One needs to attach these together. Instructions were easy and clear, but for me the bar was slightly angled after i put two segments together. By the way you need to attach the segments and hit the rod hard on a hard/concrete surface. May be i didn't do it right! but it is not worth installing this bar in this fashion and lift upwards of 100 lbs.Another thing to keep in mind is length of the rod. The length is short, if you plan to use on a wider bench, your weights will come in contact with back struts.Ashwani Sehgal"
2,Not for serious lifters,"This 100-pound weight set is not worth the time for advanced training. The bar is hollowed out and the plates are just two thick. If you want to get any additional weights you won't be able to fit much else on. I actually got the set because I was looking for some cheap plates for my adjustable dumbells but I can't fit more than one of these plates on it so it is really useless. The set took over a week just to ship, but that may be an anomaly. This is something I will return. If you are not as serious about lifting or are a beginner this will probably be a good deal, but for someone stronger it is worthless. Don't let the price get the best of you."
5,Amendment to Previous Bad Rating,"Though the previous version I had (Vers 8) would NOT work properly on my Dell Windows XP, I have just installed VERS 9, which WORKS FINE! (Don't know why they show so many diff versions, makes very confusing). The Program is EXCELLENT for improving typing speed and accuracy, setting up very methodical training level lesson plans starting from the expertise level you establish (it keeps track of your progress), AND makes the whole experience fun by having lots of fun typing games and other areas you can also go to when you want to take a break from the lessons. FAR SUPERIOR to Mavis Beacon's - makes increasing your speed fun!"
3,Not what I ordered... but it'll work,"The watch I received is not the watch I ordered, but it'll do. There is a silver circle in the middle of the watch that was sent to me and there is no silver circle on the picture provided."
3,Quite small,"I understood from the description that this was a women's watch, but never expected it to be so small with such a short strap. It really should be described as a child's watch."
3,Casio Womens watch,"The plastic band is strong, the watch is light, and it has already stood up to a lot of wear very well. I haven't had any problems with it, except it was smaller than I thought it would be."
5,As Expected,"I ordered the black Casio Women's Analog Watch with white face and I am happy to say it is exactly what I expected. I paid less than 10 dollars for this watch and it is worth the money. Simple in style, simple yet attractive in design, not uncomfortable, and works. I am happy with this purchase."
1,you pay for what you get,This watch runs very small. I had to cut a new hole in it for my wrist. It is also junk as the watch died 6 days after receiving it.
3,Photo Fail,I don't understand why Amazon couldn't take pictures of the real face of this watch. It's not all white. There's a giant stainless steel circle in the middle which I think looks really cheap and gross. I guess they'd never sell any if they had an accurate photo of the product. But I really like the rest of the watch. Especially the thin band. Maybe that disgusting circle was considered classy in the 80's.
1,Bad Battery,"This would have been just right for me if the watch was working when received. It appeared that the battery was dead on arrival. I felt that I should not have to replace the battery. To Amazon's credit, they did authorize a return immediately."
2,Tiny face,"The problem with this watch is that the watch has a very tiny face and is more of child's first watch, rather than for an adult. The face is so small that reading glasses are required to see the time and tweezers are needed to adjust the time with such a miniscule adusting knob."
4,not bad,Not a bad watch for the price. It is a great every day watch. It's small but not too small to be able to read the numbers.
2,Recieved 6/7/2011,"Died 9/6/2012. If u only need it for a year, fire away. I'm going back2using stop watches. They last longer."
2,A Eurythmics Tragedy,"Historically, this was a low point for the band. They made a soundtrack for ""1984"" that the director hated and I think critics derided too. I remember seeing a photo of Dave and Annie crying upon the album's release. Whereas ""Sex Crime"" did well in Europe, but not in the US, where the title raised concerns, ""Julia"" was one of the band's worst-performing singles. If you hear this record, it may seem like an extended mix, but it is just the version that is on the soundtrack. They may have add about a minute to the song ""Ministry of Love,"" however. There is an American, independent film about a teen's coming-out that shows this record in the background because the main character is a Eurythmics fan. Remember that the single had a slow, boring video for it too? The cover actually shows a female character from ""1984' after an ""adult"" scene. I owned this record back in the day, but only those who worship the Eurythmics would need it now."
2,Classical music's heavy metal.,"Another disc concocted by the RCA marketing boys who brought us the daffy ""Space Classics"" CD. This is one will also have limited appeal to anyone who knows much about music, but I suppose it would make a fair demonstration disc. The first three or four tracks will rattle the walls and peel the paint with the best of them. Also highly recommended, at appropriate volume levels, for breaking leases."
2,BEWARE OF WHAT YOU ORDER,When you order Old Spice BEWARE...I read closely and thought Iwas ordering Original and I got Classic...there is a big difference.There is a difference in the scent. If you send it back you haveto pay the postage.
5,Old Spice Aftershave,"My dad used this when i was growing up & i regularly buy him a bottle when he's used up the last one. He likes it & i love it, it's warm & musky & i hope it never ever stops being made. It's one of the world's classic favourites !"
4,Love the smell; haven't smelled any others like it.,"Some people are not too fond of Old Spice; in contrast, my dad always wore Old Spice when I was a kid, so as someone could imagine I definitely enjoy the scent. The scent of Old Spice is masculine; it is a sweet musky smell. To me, I find it as a traditional scent, such as Stetson Original. The only con, is that it is alcohol based, so it can dry out the skin."
1,Not what I ordered,"My first view of the bottle, which did not match the picture, suggested that this was not the Original Old Spice that I ordered, but a shoddy imitation, was definitely confirmed when I pulled the plug. This is my rating of the product.Now, my rating of the seller: when I called, the waiting time was short before a person answered. She was pleasant, polite, and gave me the information I needed, which was: give her my e-mail address, print the return mailing label, and deliver the package to the local Post Office by the end on the week. The result was a full refund. I can not find any fault with their handling of my request. However, I question how they can hope for further business when my only experience with them has been an inferior product sold under a long esteemed name? In my case, they won't get it."
1,Misleading,"The picture shows the original Old Spice sent. What you get is the classic, which is not the same. I was very disappointed and felt they were misleading. Sent back the four bottles I ordered."
1,ordered (ofriginal)old spice got (original classic) old spice--not the same,I have ordered old spice original several times before. this time I received old spice originalm(classic) which is totally different
5,A real page turner!,"Exciting, enthralling book! Well worth reading! Anyone interested in prison life should read this book, very realistic!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"Although the concept of this webcam is nice and compact, which I was looking for since I didn't want to bother with cables and was planning to use it with my laptop for travel, the performance is mediocre. As in the other reviews, the placement of the lights is not logical and don't really do anything to enhance the image. The built-in microphone is so-so, and the picture quality is grainy. I was also wary of the software since my computer (Windows XP) did not recognize it to be compatible, but the user guide insists that it is and directs the user to bypass all the warning windows, which I did and it worked, but again, was not impressed with the quality. I ended up purchasing another webcam from logitech. The price is cheap, but don't expect it to be high quality."
3,Decent game!,"When the skateboarding game phenom blew up on the PSX after the release of the first Tony Hawk game this was undoubtable to come behind it. While this game isn't horrible back then, by todays standard its just not a good game. The controls are weak and unresponsive. The graphics are sub-par even for back then. The sound isn't bad though with some great liscense music. You could easily find a better pick these days."
1,There's not enough in this game to be a copy-cat.,"The physics in this game are outrageous. Try this. When at home, get on your skateboard or any thing else that rolls, and go full speed at a wall. Do you know what happens? You fall down. Not evan the best skaters could sustain such a hit. Unless you are in this game. In this game however, you just stop. This is a bad thing. Also, when you do fall(and when attemting tricks you will do a lot of)you only have two bail animations. Falling on you back, and, well, your back in a different way. Grinding will lead to such rages that you have never imagened. No clue as to when you are going to fall off. Oh, and don't evan think about doing any other tricks, not that there are many to try. The only thing good is the music. Don't buy this."
5,"Yes, he is still trippin' and tellin' the truth!!","Steve Harvey has always been funny to me from the radio to the tv show to the celebration of gospel. Now when people started to get mad at Steve for the comment he made relevant to Michael Vick, I think that people really didn't understand the comment. He was making a comparison of the Michael Vick case to the Sean Bell shooting. He simple implied that Michael was charged with dog fighting and sent to prison, but seven NYPD detectives kill Sean Bell and get sent home.Three men were shot at 50 times and one was killed....Now who's the sickening one?When mentioning Barack Obama in the movie he stated that a guy asked him why he was voting for him and he replied, ""because he's black"". Then Steve stated, ain't that the reason you ain't voting for him?""I can relate to that as for I live in a very Predominately white townand was always asked that same question and accused of being reverseracist."
4,Well.....,"All in all the DVD was okay. It started skipping in some parts. Hey, stuff happens.Thx.Debbie"
3,Not Steve's best work but worth buying,"This DVD is worth buying, but it did have a couple of parts where I was just sitting there looking at the TV showing no emotion. Don't expect to laugh through the entire movie, but I do feel that you will be satisfied with your purchase.I feel this movie deserves a 3***"
2,Not so funny anymore,I used to really enjoy Steve Harvey but this DVD was not impressive. I did not find it funny at all to continually downgrade family and people of the black race.
2,Not that impressed,I'm a big fan of Steve Harvey's but I wasn't impressed with this DVD. He drags out the jokes a too long for me.
3,Slightly Disappointed...,"I must admit that I was slightly disappointed by this dvd. I saw Steve Harvey in concert a year ago and I'm an avid listener of his the Steve Harvey Morning Show. So, when I heard this dvd was coming out, I purchased it. Well, I'm sad to say that although some of the material was new, I saw Mr. Harvey perform much of the material before; so, it wasn't new to me."
2,Misleading:(,"I thought this video was ""clean"" like ""Don't Trip..."" I was wrong! Not into all the cussing stuff -those days are over for me. If you are thinking this video is like the first one, IT'S NOT! I gave it away!"
1,Disappointed - Tear you mouth out tour? I think NOT!,"I was very disappointed with this dvd. I wish I wouldn't have spent my money on it. I almost fell asleep trying to watch this dvd. He only had 1 really funny joke. I listen to his show every morning driving to work. The majority of the jokes he has already said on his radio show. It did not tear my mouth out. I think that Mr. Harvey is a very talented guy, but this dvd did not do it for me and I was quite disappointed in it. He never did finish his last joke. It was a waste of my money. If you want to rent it and watch it or watch a friends dvd, then I would suggest you to do that before actually purchasing a copy for your self to keep."
1,Steve Harvey:Still Trippin',"Steve Harvey seems like a Nice and Intelligent person,kind of like Bill Cosby(Almost),He is not hilarious,especially in this long and at times boring stand up.I don't care if someone curses or not,I found the ghetto wedding bit funny and his talk about His sons wanting Dread Locks or tattoos etcera.However when he got political and his reasoning was he voted just to vote for someone skin's color made him as ""Ig-Nant"" as he says as the next person or more,I ""Hope"" He does not vote for the same mistake again based on one's skin,If it were about that I would have never voted for anyone who did not have my name or similar or skin tone."
3,satisfied,"This was ok. It was not as good as the first one, God is not through with me yet. I didn't expect the cursing. The jokes was just alright."
1,Dog fighting humor? No thank you!,"steve harvey can be a very funny comedian but in this performance, the endless toilet humor and the incredibly tasteless jokes about quarter back michael vick and dog fighting left me reeling. i totally agree with his sean bell observations but michael vick? in my opinion he got off easy!! people should be made more aware of the deplorable cruelty of dogfighting and not witness these horrors being dismissed in the name of 'comedy'. after lines like ""**** the dogs, let the man play"" - i lost total interest in this show."
3,Don't get gassed,"I loved his last DVD as well as all prior shows but this one screams ""worn out your welcome"". Sounds like something he put together to meet a deadline or some kind of performance obligation. Some jokes were hilarious like his addressing his niece on the phone and the convo w/his wife. I would have given it 2 or 2.5 stars for expecting better from this iconic comedian (no sarcasm intended) but I gave it 3 because I know die hards will get a kick out of it."
5,Steve Harvey: Still Trippin',"Respected stand-up comic Steve Harvey delivers his unique act to an appreciative crowd on this concert video. Harvey now takes on all topics--from polygamists to poor families--with the razor-sharp, painfully honest wit that made him famous. No-holds-barred with this one folks."
2,"Starts out hilarious, then goes downhill...","First of all I love Steve Harvey and loved his first video and gave it rave reviews, but this dvd was a bit of a waste of my money. It started out very funny with him talking and joking about his radio program and the questions that he is given. Hilarious in that you have tears in your eyes from laughing so hard, but then, a major thud comes when he gets political, as our economy is NOT something I want to hear about when I'm wanting to laugh. Putting down the present government and all that political stuff just isn't funny and the audience was unmoved as well. Stick to comedy Steve and stay away from the current day state of the economy and you will keep us all laughing. Still love him, but disappointed in this one ..."
2,Not Steve's Best,I am a huge Steve Harvey fan and was excited to find this on the store shelves. My family and I watched and sadly we all agreed not his best. The bathroom humour was overdone and the monkey joke lasted too long and was not that funny. Some of it was funny but all in all just not up to his normal level.
2,"If you're not religious or are an atheist (like me), don't bother buying it.","I love Steve Harvey from his beginnings. The way he speaks and curses gives the comedy a really funny twist. But this time he is way to deep into religion, which means he doesn't curses and only talks about religion."
1,Still Trippin DVD by Steve Harvey,The DVD makes crazy noises as it plays. not sure why?? I even checked the player with other discs and no noises but this DVD consistenly makes noises. It really made the audio difficult to hear. Going to return
3,Ok,Steve Harvey: Still Trippin' was ok. I like Steve more as an actor when playing comedy. The stand up was not that funny to me although he touched on some very important issues that we all can relate to. I would say rent it before buying and I'm glad I did not buy this from Best Buy. Not worth more then ten dollars.
4,Beware of the Dark and the Monkies,"Once again Steve delivers. After starting off a tadbit slow. He picks it up and closes it out. Finally getting to where you are sitting there with your jawbone lose and not intact. Yes the last joke does kind of just drop, but everything before that has you rolling so hard and stomach in knots. I listen to his show every day and as much as I laugh at his show. I laughed at this DVD. Wasn't as jampacked with jokes as I thought, but never the less. Steve shows why he is one of the greats still left. Definitely worth the money that you will spend. Purchase the DVD...get you some popcorn....and prepare to laugh your insides out."
1,in very bad taste,"I absolutely love steve harvey, I watch his old tv show every day, so I was excited to buy this dvd.It started out very funny just like I thought it would, but if you like dogs, I suggest you don't waste your money. He made an extremely bad joke about michael vick's dogs, implying vick did nothing wrong. I can't repeat what he said. But after that, nothing he said was funny anymore, so I stopped the dvd and will probably return it for a refund!"
1,BE CAREFUL!! NOT AS GOOD AS KINGS OF COMEDY,"the dvd isnt worth buying, the cussing is okay, but nothing stomach turning and florr dropping!!"
2,TINGUME,WELL HE IS WHAT HE IS A LITTLE MUCH FOR ME BUT I BROUGHT IT BECAUSE SOMEONE SAID IT WAS TOTALLY FUNNY
5,Steve Harvey. Still trippin,A great DVD. We laughed so much all the way through it. Even though we had seen it before we just had to get a copy. We love watching it and look forward to showing it to all our friends when they come to stay with us. Steve Harvey is just a riot!!! Would highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.
4,Paint & Price - Touch 'n Tone,"I gave this paint 4 Stars for it's product/price value. It's not a bad paint at all, but like all non bake hardend or, two part(exothermic) curing paints, it's surface finish is not very durable.It should be finished off with a tough clear coat finish, like Rust Oleum's 7701 or Painter's Touch 2x Clear coats. This will add much needed durability against surface abrasion.NOTE: Clear coats should be added within 1 hour of main color application - this is because once paint begins to ""skin""(harden) the clear coat may cause rippling, lifting or folding. Or you could wait 24 hours or longer for paint to fully cure...longer paint cure befor using CLEAR is always better.P.S. By the way seller's delivery time was stellar, very timely!!!"
4,Great Ending to the book,"The ending to this book was the best part of the book. It seemed to drag a bit in the beginning and almost had two separate themes to the book. (buying and caring for the lizard, the science fair tadpole project) I did like the ending and thought it a great life lesson for all kids. Great read for younger beginning readers."
4,Personel corrections,"Corrected data for this session:This session was recorded in The Netherlands (Hilversum) on April 2, 1965.Wes Montgomery - guitarClark Terry - trumpetPim Jacobs - pianoRuud Jacobs - bassHan Bennink - drumsOn the same day, another session was recorded, this time on film, with the same group but without Clark Terry. This footage is available on the DVD ""Wes Montgomery - Live in 1965"""

1,Not what it seems,This dress is one size fits all. It only looks good on someone that is a sample size or model size of a 0 or 2. They really should have more sizes available and more information about the actual size before buying it. Returned it the very next day I got it.
3,"Comprehensive, but difficult for beginners","This is the first palmistry book I have purchased. It provided a good overview of the many facets of palm reading. I feel like I understand the various things that palm readers observe. However, I did not walk away with an understanding of how to interpret what is observed. A book with sample photos instead of basic sketch drawings might be more helpful."
2,Not perfectly accurate or complete,"First, the review by Ed Cambell (above) is terribly unfair as he is listed in this book as assisting in the final product.There are parts of the book where the chapter fails to address the ""questions"" that appear at the beginning of the chapter. So, some of it is incomplete. So, while the description of some chapters tell the reader what the chapter is about, you can finish the chapter and find that it did not live up to its description. This is very odd.Also, while the author has some very interesting insights, he interprets some lines of the palm is some fairly offbeat ways. If you have been reading palms or have been reading a compendium of palmistry books, you will fine this book a little strange."
1,Out of touch,"Some of the terminology in this book is demeaning and insulting. For instance the authors refer to a male who is in touch with his feminine side as ""fey"" and suggests that homosexual men have ""too much moon"". I hate this book for this reason. I would suggest the OTHER books on palmistry and suggest you skip this outdated insensitive book."
3,DVD finally here!,"I was lucky enough to see this film on the big screen. There's a good bit of humor between and the zombie stomping scenes. I'm glad it has made the rounds of horror and zombie festivals and is now available on DVD, just in time for Valentine's Day!"
2,Stupid Movie,The film quality is horrible. It is very grainy. The acting is bad. The zombies were not good zombies. The music was way too loud and wasn't good any way. Plus the DVD was a DVD-R. I didn't hate it. I just didn't like it
1,Don't Waste your money!!!!!,It is student flim not a real flim. If you like second year flim student movies THIS IS YOU. What a load of crap never enven watched the end. It was bad in every way! I wished someone would have warned me about this flim!!!and I love alomst any type of Zombie flim but this is not worth a $1 dollar.
1,Excrement!,"Scatophillia is a ""thing"" I have never fully understood. Some people are into it, though. For that select crowd, this movie is for you!I am the greatest zombie movie fan ever born (I was actually an extra in the original Dawn of the Dead), but this doesn't qualify as a ""horror"" or ""zombie"" (the effects wouldn't fool a challenged third grader) or ""acting"". It's shot on tape, negligibly scripted and stars (""stars?"") an astonishing collection of wooden fence posts as actors. This is feces on a a shiny shiny DVD."
5,Carmine makes learning fun,This is a good learning DVD. Basically it is a video of Carmine teaching a workshop. What I like is1. He makes it fun2. He gives you some interesting ways to practice3. He provides a couple of different ways to add variety to a rhythm (give me give me chocolate chocolate - you have to watch the DVD to understand)4. He teaches you to practice changing rhythms.
2,"entertaining, not much more","it was an easy read, occasionally funny & went through ""penis in various realms"".this book was recommended to me for men or adolescents who could use more information about their sexual organ- THAT it wasn't.It wasn't helpful AT ALL if you wanted to learn about yourself as a man or for women to help you understand the man's penis."
2,Not much here,"I thought this would be an interesting & harmlessly naughty little book my wife would get a kick out of. Unfortunately, the tone was 3rd grade silliness. This topic deserves a much more creative effort."
2,Pachmayr 1100 Recoil Pad,"Product I received did not match the picture in the Amazon listing. It did not fit my Model 1100 (it was too long). The pad looks amateurish, not professional at all. I'll never buy another one."
1,Absolutely worthless!,"The worst thing I have ever purchased. I went through six blades in an hour. Seriously, if you need blades, get the REAL blades, the ones that are an inch or so wide, and thick. These broke and fell apart after every knot they hit in the wood. Complete waste of $26"
4,good,I hope that Jade does not get Jeremy. She treats him like dirt. I hope Jessica and Jeremy get back together. I can't wait until Never Let Go comes out.
3,Ehhhh,"this book wanst as good as the others. there was no reference to ken or will or melissa. they are the most interesting charcters, they def. should be in some coming up."
1,Private Investigations: How to Be Successful!,"I bought three how to detective books and this one was the most expensive and totally lame. If you are interested in a 1950-ish Polly Annish commercial on the exciting world of being a private detective, then this is the book for you. Repetitive and dull presentation of the most obvious and mundane facts that are basically useless. If it had presented the real business issues around being a detective, pros and cons, options for dealing with such matters that would be one thing. Instead this book is akin to the most gung-ho military recruiter who will only speak in the most glowing and simplistic of terms. A total waste of time and money. Just say no! Outstanding books instead are Be Your Own Detective and the amazingly thorough Get the Facts on Anyone. The former has more about the nature of the business, the latter an incredible compendium of investigative techniques."
2,Buy another book,This book is vague and very basic common sense knowledge. It has no real inspiration on how to get started or make your private investigation business better. I was very disappointed.
4,Nolan helmet,"This is a superior helmet. Sadly for us however, there was no way to try it on before the purchase. They run small. The seller let us know there were no returns and we felt secure in the fact it would fit after viewing the chart for sizing. This was purchased for my elderly neighbor via myself as he has no computer. He understood the conditions. It is now for sale on e-bay."
4,The only hawaiian cd you'll ever need,"We brought this cd home with us after doing a lot of careful listening at the local music store near our hotel in Oahu. Gabby's recording from the 60's just personify Hawaii with his flow and style, so understated musically but incredibly uplifting. Try this album while gardening or during a sunny spring brunch and watch the mood change in the room. Or take it to the beach with you and just chill.Gabby plays slack key guitar and this whole album is just percussion and guitars. Gabby has a wonderfully expressive voice and isn't drowned out by over-production like so many other hawaiian albums."
4,This was a good movie,"This was the third movie I did not know existed, until now. At the end of the show, I thought Bert and Crystal would kiss each other on the lips. But Crystal kissing Bert on the cheek, well that's close enough."
1,Poor quality,"You would think that since the box shows pictures of filled shot glasses that the set I bought could handle having liquor in them. Not so. The board got some water on it and the frosted top wiped right off. Then the frosted half of the shot glasses themselves wiped right off. Now I'm left with a blank square of glass and 24 identical shot glasses. Not really helpful when something claims to be ""shot glass checkers."" My advice: buy something else."
4,Well worth having,"This duo, who would form a loose group, Conundrum, after, do a great job here I think. This is def. more bluesy than Pentangle, or even some of Bert's other solo albums, but fine singing & playing in that vein. Price is daunting & maybe not absolutely essential; but nice one to hear Bert in those 'post-Pentangle I' days."
1,Dirty Grease,"I hate leaving negative reviews, but in this case have no other option. I wish I had purchased a single box of 6 instead of 12 boxes of 6, because 11 boxes will now be trashed. As soon as I opened the case box, all I could smell was dirty grease. I went ahead and filled 6 shells, my husband and I each tried one & threw the remaining 4 filled shells away. The filling did not over ride the nasty flavor and odor of the shells. In addition, several shells came broken. If anyone knows of a good brand to try, please advise. Thank you!"
3,Bellini Cannoli shells,"I found the overall quality of this product to be quite good. While the shells were not as crisp as homemade, they were flavorful and easy to fill. Although about 20% of the shells were broken in shipping, they were still a bargain compared to similar products."
5,Funny Family Film,"Great movie for the whole family. It has a great soundtrack with original music. Many, many laughs and surprises. Lots of fun!"
1,DO NOT BELIEVE THE REVIEWS!!!!,I purchased this movie based on the reviews and I have been duped. This movie is not good at all. Do not waste your money. I will no longer purchase from Amazon soley based on the reviews. Buyer beware!
4,Gift for my mother,I bought this as a xmas gift for my mother. I'm sure she will enjoy it as it shows scenes taken in our home town.
4,"Good, Clean Family Fun!","A rare find among movies today, Three Blind Saints is hysterically funny, clean, and has a great message that is not too ""preachy."" I highly recommend it!"
4,250 Essential Chinese Charaters for Everyday Use Vol. 1,"Philip Yungkin Lee has done an outstanding job of combining meaningful character contexts, exercises and review material. The book depicts both traditional Chinese characters and the simplified character set. If you have both the time and the patience, you can learn a multitude of essential characters and phrases. One thing I would suggest to Turtle Publishing, is to expand the Student's Guide section dealing with pinyin pronunciations on page xii; add pronunciations of multiple vowel combinations. Outside of this one recommendation, if you are planning a trip to China and truly want to learn how to both read and write ""putonghau"" Vol.1 and 2 are the books for you."
4,"Love it, but adjustable would be nice","I love the elliptical trainer, and use it 5-6 times weekly. My husband weighs 50 # more than me, and he's equally comfortable on it.My only adjustment was to zip-tie a light plastic tray under the handpieces to allow a space to hold tissues & eyeglasses.My only complaint is that the console is not adjustable, so it's too far away for me to read my magazine while using it. I wish the magazine rack pieces were adjustable (move closer together). I have to hold my reading material in one hand and hang on with the other if I want to read while I exercise.But all in all, I'm very glad I purchased it!"
2,"NOT ""giant"" print!","They must have awfully small 'giants' where this publisher lives! The print can't be any more than 12 pt.If you are vision impaired (like me) and want a Bible that's easy to read, DON'T buy this one!"
2,"Nice big print, but pages too thin","The Giant print is great, but the pages appear to be too thin, because the print from the other side of each page shows through on the side you are reading. This is very distracting. Go for the real leather edition, which is slightly thicker."
1,Not a lectern Bible,The center column is to wide and the font text tall but too narrow. Red font for words of Jesus not so good - makes it harder to read. Pages too thin - text seen through from other side. Overall this is NOT a lectern Bible. I wish someone would publish a super giant NKJV with black text throughout and no references.
2,Wrong item shipped,"I ordered a burnished beater, but was shipped a white one in a box marked 'burnished.' Getting sent the wrong item seems to be fairly common, judging by some of the other comments here, so be sure to check the box as soon as you get it."
2,Not new,"My current KitchenAid mixer's beaterhead's skin is pealing off. I thought it was worth the experiment of ordering a plain metal one. I'm happy with how fast I got it, but it appears used when it was advertized as new. I found it deceiving to receive an apparently used one that I thought was new."
4,Replacement flat beater,"Purchased this flat beater for my kitchenaid artisan mixer after the original beater (with the white coating) started, rather soon after purchase, cracking and peeling (even after hand washing only). Hand washing this one also, just in case, as I don't really trust the dishwasher. It would be nice if companies like this would just use good old fashioned stainless steel to make more of their products with! I think that most people know quality when they see it and are willing to pay for it as long as it means that it will last."
5,burnished beater,this is alot better then the one with yhe white cover over it kitchenaid sould include this beater when you buy a mixer
5,Better than the Original.,"The beater I got with my blender had a ceramic coating that started to chip off fairly soon in it's use. I didn't want pieces of ceramic in our food so was relieved to replace it with this. Be sure you get this size and not the larger beater for your standard mixer. I first got the larger one thinking it would work in my larger bowl that has a handle but it was a ""no go""."
4,Check your model before ordering,"I like the burnished model instead of the coated since there isn't anything to wear out. But make sure you have the right model to fit your model of mixer. The model number is on a sticker on the underside of the mixer. The Kitchen Aid Classic I have is model number K45SS which this beater might fit but isn't the exact fit, according to this parts website:[....]Always double check before you order."
3,Eh...kinda regret getting this beater.,"It's a beater, one of the ones that normally comes with a newly purchased KitchenAid Mixer (ours was a KSM-150). My wife and lost ours a the move and opted to replace it. Sadly, it leaves a lot to be desired. Even if coated with a non-stick cooking spray, 90% of the time spent mixing, you have to stop after a few minutes to either scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula or batter spreader, un-clump the beater itself, or to a texture check to make sure that there isn't raw flour, sugar, or anything else stuck to the bottom or sides. After reading reviews, we chose this: (...) - much better!"
1,Looks like my beater,"but it really wasn't. Cost me as much to send it back as the original price. If you could be sure of the size, it would be a good buy."
4,Works well in KitchenAid Artisan,We bought this aluminum beater and found it to be light but sturdy and a good fit on our KitchenAid Artisan Model KSM150PSER 325 watt mixer.
4,Better Beater - No Flaking Paint,"This beater replaces the one shipped w/my new Artisan mixer. I agree w/other reviewers that this should be the beater shipped w/the mixer. After using my cheap, painted beater for a short time - it started flaking! My beater-to-bowl clearance was correct. When I complained to KA, I got an email explaining how to check the clearance & directing me to their overpriced website to buy a new beater. I was not impressed & fortunately, they are not the only place to buy a new beater. KA has slipped in quality over the last several years. I have an old KA mixer (20+ years) that I moved to my weekend house when I got the new Artisan. That beater/mixer is fine & has seen a lot of work.This uncoated beater has to be hand washed or it will discolor....if they just went back to their old coating formula, we wouldn't have this problem!"
2,KichenAid Burnished Flat Beater: Looks Good; Doesn't Fit,"Although it looked good, and although I was careful to select the beater specific to my model of the KitchenAid Stand mixer, I was very disappointed that the beater I was sent does not fit my mixer.It is entirely too short to reach down to the bottom of the mixing bowl."
4,Great paddle replacement.,Great priced product. Not dishwasher safe. I made this mistake now it's not bright but it still works. Great price for replacement blade.
4,Good product,"The white beaters that came with my Kitchen Aid stand mixer were great, but the white coating peeled off. This beater is much better, in that it is not coated. It works great!"
5,Lov'n it,"Love it. (The enamel on the original beater that came with my mixer, started to chip.). Works out great everytime. Easy to clean. I don't need to worry anymore of enamel chipping again."
1,Didn't stay burnished,"I ordered this because my orignial beater blade had chipped. I used it one time and it was a sticky recipe. All the burnishment came off after I had no choice but to soak it to get it clean. Now it leaves a metal residue on everything, including cloth. I am going to have to order another beater to replace the chipped one and the one I can't use."
4,Good but misleading..,"It's good CD but the track listing here is misleading. It only has ""Breaking Up The Girl"", ""Happiness"", and ""Breaking Up The Girl (Timo Maas Remix)"". No video. I was a bit dissapointed, but loved it all the same.."
5,"""Is this a test? Please let me rest...""","Breaking Up the Girl Pt. 2 by Garbage is a great import to say the least. The single is hot, hot, hot and you get a remix track and a new unreleased track called Happiness Part 2. It's kinda funny it is labeled Part 2 when there is no Happiness Part 1. Garbage have the best imports, too bad imports are not a big deal anymore, aww... those were the days!"
3,FUNKY BREAKS AND ICY CHILLOUT...,"TIMO MAAS TURNS IN A NICE FUNKY BREAKS WORKOUT HERE...NICE FOR EARLY SETS OR WARMUP MATERIAL...A PLUS IS THE ""HAPPINESS PT.2"" B-SIDE...VERY COLD AND ARCTIC FEELING...GREAT FOR CHILLED SETS IN CAFES OR ON THE BALEARIC ISLES..."
3,Garbage,"This cd Breaking Up The Girl is pretty good. It had the original Breaking Up The Girl Track which is really good if you like rock-pop. The second song is Happiness is okay, the begging is really weird she repeats Dosen't know me daddy a few times and there is this keyboard sounding music in the back. Through the entire song She just says Happiness is this a test do you think i'm blessed etc. you can get the lyrics from a garbage page. The song is not bad but it's not the kind of ""Garbage"" music I like. The last song on this album is Breaking Up The Girl REMIX which personally I HATE!!! Why do people have to make the song sound so dumb. I can not stand techno. But IF you like techno you would probably like it..."
4,Great Stuff here!,Lots of important information for me as a former 5th grade teacher to use with my Kinder class. You forget what kinder students can do from a viewpoint of an intermediate teacher.
2,Not well written or particularly interesting.,"I suppose if you are a pilot, hearing Edgerton re-tell his own experiences learning to fly would be pretty interesting. If you're just interested in planes, the book is just OK. If you're looking for a good story you'll be deeply disappointed.About 1/3 of the book is learning to fly one plane after another. About 1/3 is an attempt to make sense out of his service in Vietnam. The remaining 1/3 is filler with an occasional anecdote, sometimes interesting.What is so surprising is how clumsily the text is written and how little he has to say. I think maybe he wrote this book too long after the fact. The Vietnam war was a long time ago, and his memories have faded."
3,"Sad to read ,hard to imagine","This story told about the plights of the poor. Many believe these people are dirty, lazy, and waiting for handouts. As you read this you realize the lies that have been told about the poor and destitute."
3,Whose Names Are Unknown: A Novel,Found this to be very informative about the Dust Bowl era. I was curious after I learned that this was written at the same time as the Grapes of Wrath but the publisher passed on it because Steinbeck was a better known author. This story actually spends more time in Oklahoma than after they arrived in California.
3,"Too little, too late.","I have to disagree with the other reviews here. I bought this book after watching Ken Burns' film and being intrigued by the comparison to Steinbeck's novel, but this story never came to life for me. I began skipping towards the end about half way through. The author had a lyrical way with words but the story plodded along with passive sentences, and the point of view jumped all over the place. A first person point of view, Julia's, would have brought more realism.There was an entire chapter on milking cows and feeding chickens. What was the point of that? If this book had been published when it was written it might have struck a chord, but now it's too little, too late."
3,Whose Names Are Unknown,This book was really autobiographical to an extent and was interesting in that it was deeper in the description of the hardships of the people prior to emigrating.
5,Better than Grapes of Wrath,This is an excellent book about the Dust Bowl and mass migration of individuals from our nations bread basket to California. It's a part of our history you don't read much about and this novel gives a good synopsis of what happened. I have read the Grapes of Wrath and find this book to be much better. It makes me wonder what our society would be like with out our safety nets and without regulations on how to treat it's workers. It was a bad time in our history.
4,Back in Time,"This book really made me realize what a struggle these farmers had. I saw ""Dustbowl"" on the history channel but this book gave a more personal touch to their individual everyday life."
5,The Dust Bowl,"This is a great book taking you back to the Dust Bowl and the hardships that people suffered, but fictionalized to make it up close and personal. A great read."
4,Whose names Are Unknown,I was captivated with the events in the first part but lost interest easily when the family moved on to California. Still a very good book. Glad i bought it.
5,"Wonderful Fragrance, Sample Itty Bitty Freebie","I've been looking for this perfume and it always seems to be sold out locally so I decided to try the sample size on Amazon. The fragrance is wonderful BUT the sample is the little tiny glass pipette they hand out at the mall for FREE. So with shipping this cost me about $10. That's an incredible amount considering that they toss it into a little bubble mailer and has an excellent chance of arriving broken. Yes, they do tell you the size they're sending but unless you have something to compare it to, it's hard to picture. I plan on purchasing the fragrance but ordering the sample size is a big waste of money. My advice: go to a department store and ask for a free sample; save your $10 for something more substantial."
5,Positive Review for DKNY,"This DKNY perfume sample is perfect for stocking stuffers when you can't afford to buy the larger, full-sized bottles of perfume. I would buy more from this company and recommend them to anyone."
1,Sample product NOT FOR RESALE,"I can't believe I just paid for these two small vials of perfume when they clearly say ""NOT FOR RESALE"" ~ what company does things like this? I would NEVER purchase from this company again ~"
5,Great book!,This was good book if you are looking to learn about reading problems for K-12. I used for a masters course and it is a book that I will keep for a reference. I got it from Book Emporium used and it came in better than good condition.
4,good resource guide,I purchased this book for a graduate level class. Has good information but definately a college textbook. I plan to keep as a reference though.
1,old book!,"This book had been through the ringer! It was faded and worn on all edges. The packaging did little to prtect it, as well."
4,It was a great book.,"I think this book is a very great book! I would recomend it to everyone. You do not need to like biography to read this book! I could sort of relate to Daisy ""Juliette"" Everybody should read it!"
2,Disappointed,"As a dedicated Girl Scout volunteer, I bought several of these books thinking I would donate them to local schools. I was very disappointed when I discovered that the story starts with Juliette at about age 5 defending the Confederacy, with family slaves packing for her trip north to escape the war. As an adult I respect the Southern heritage which I share myself. But this is such a contoversial topic I find it difficult to understand why a book for children would start here. I gave the books to my adult friends but would not recommend it for children. Of all the things that Juliette Low did, said and accomplished, I'm confused why a children's author would put such emphasis on this part of her life when she was only 5 years old."
5,The best picture book by the best picture book author,"All of Graham Oakley's children's books are splendid in all the ways that a picture book should be - the text and plot are simple enough for young children to grasp while entertaining enough to amuse older siblings and adults, and the illustrations are superb. But The Church Cat Abroad is the very top of the line. It's an utter shame that the thing should ever have been allowed to go out of print. The scene of the cat and the mice painting each other in watercolor is not-to-be-missed"
5,A wonderfull addition to my collection of electronica,"Not being a fan of madonna, but being a huge fan of trance (Oakenfold, Sasha) and electronica (Saint Ettiene) I was skeptical to buy this album.Although I think in some sense Madonna as a persona does not really sell well, the music is superb and grows on you rather quickly. The attempts to be ""sufi"" and ""profound"" are artificial, BUT highly effective, and I think it is the result of her ability to bring out the recognizable and simple beauty of tone from ORBIT, her partner in this CD so that you get elements of electronica that are just pop enough to please everyone. I would strongly recommend this CD to anyone, especially someone who is trying to get their ears accustomed to electronica."
5,A pop milestone of the decade -- a collector's item,"It's a great record, will be remembered as one of the best albums of the '90s. I, too, bought this album soon after it was released, and I'm still listening to it multiple times each week. You never get tired of it. The single ""Ray of Light"" is worth its weight in gold, one of the best singles of the rock era."
5,"More Mature than ""Like A Prayer""","Ray of Light showed Madonna as a great song writer in her own right. As I can't tell you the billboard staticts of this album since I don't have them right now I do know the singles I know that Frozen peaked at #2 on the billboard charts and it is easily one of the most inspirational songs! This album talks about how she acted in the past ""Your Frozen when your heart is not open"" Same with ""Nothing Really Matters"" told you that in the 80's she just wanted to make herself happy not everybody around her.. Other good songs on the album are ""Subsitute for Love"", ""Power of Goodbye"", ""Swim"" and ""Sky fits Heaven"" Go get lost in the RAY OF LIGHT !"
5,...in a very dark repertoire..,"I'm sorry and I will probably upset a lot of people when I say I hated most of Madonna's material but every cloud has a silver lining...This is Madge at her absolute awsome best. Not a bad track on the album and an acheivement which has never been equalled by her before or since.I would like to see ""Ray of Light"" re-released in Hybrid SACD format giving it the sound quality it deserves.Sadly her later material reverted to her mediocre form but ""Ray of Light"" has to be a compulsory purchase.BUY IT!!!"
3,Liked it -but wanted to love it,"Somewhat disappointed especially after all the hype. However, Since Madonna is one of my top 3 heros (go girl!), I couldn't NOT buy it. Tho I do like it more than when I first listened to it, I still can't say I love it! Frozen is still my favorite and the video is awesome. I am also a great fan of WIlliam Orbit and have most of his CD's too, I guess I expected much more. Nonetheless, not all great artist puts out all great new music every time. Keep 'em comin' and hope for a new one soon!"
4,surprised,"I have never liked Madonna or her music, I'm not into pop, but I read an article about the album in KEYBOARD magazine, and got my curiosity pricked. Some of these somes are very entertaining, others I'm not into. The first five songs plus ""Frozen"" are the best by far. I like her vocals, but not the Lyrics. The album is worth buying even just for the songs mentioned."
3,A great techno CD...if you're looking for dance-oriented tec,"I've been a techno/electronica fan for a year now. I heard Madonna was putting out an electronica-type disc, and I couldn't be more excited. I was always a fan of her early work, and this was like icing on the cake. I bought the CD and was happy and dissapointed at the same time. For the exception of ""Ray of Light,"" the album mostly consists of her singing rather boring songs over great techno instrumentals. I'd give this 5 stars w/o the lyrics, but it seems that Madonna herself takes away from the wonder of this album."
4,WAY TO GO MADONNA!,I LOVE MADONNAS NEW C.D. IT'S REALLY GREAT-- IT GOES GREAT WITH HER NEW IMAGE-- WAY TO GO MADONNA!!!
4,"Good, but not great.","If people ask me ""What's the best album of 1998,"" even though there's a lot of them, this is the first one to come out of my mouth. After a while, the songs grow on you; from the melodramatic ""Drowned World"" to the catchy beat of ""Sky Fits Heaven,"" this album is her best yet (with the exception of ""The Immaculate Collection""). If you're a true Madonna fan, you gotta get this album; if you're not, give it a try. You might like it in a while."
5,"Unique, inspiring, melodic and touching","I think that this is the best madonna album i've heard. Its so 'new'! I've never heard a sound like this - especially in the songs Drowned World, Sky Fits heaven, Skin, and Ray Of Light! There's also some power house ballads - Power Of Goodbye is unbelievably awesome!! And the dance songs are just groovy!!! I really liked a lot of the words in this album - ""Life fits living - so let your judgement go"""
3,"""Ray of Light"" illuminates a different side of Madonna","Again, Madonna the Chameleon, has dazzled us with yet another album. ""Ray of Light"", however is not her typical ""poppy"" collection of risky music. No, this album shows a whole new side to her. Full of her recent religious inspirations, the album takes on a character from the East. The music is smooth, interesting, modern and yet time-less. The single ""Ray of Light"" is a little techno gem, while songs such as ""Frozen"" and ""The Power of Goodbye"" have very different tones. They both hint at deeper meaning and understanding. Other less famous songs such as ""To Have and to Hold"" along with ""Sky Fits Heaven"" really help to support the album. Madonna goes for more artsy approaches with songs like ""Substitute for Love"" and ""Mergirl"". Highlighting her voice and little instrumentation, these songs take a minimalist view toward music. This album really is a rainbow of style and structure, all leading to a relatively deserving pot of gold."
5,Madonna sets trend for futuristic music !,"Madonna has redefined herself once again to set the trend for the future direction of pop music for the new millenium with this ear-opening new electronica album, which features her most personal, mystical work in ages. With tracks like ""Frozen"" ,""Shanti-Ashtangi"",""The Power of Goodbye"" which veer away from her traditional pop sound. Moreover, one can find no more sexual undertones as in her previous records. She has finally realized her supernatural nature with this revolutionary musical masterpiece."
1,Pretty tame songwriting,"None of these songs are very well done. The silly sythesizer elements sound out of place and tacked on to the song Frozen. The lyrics for that song are just the same four lines of dialogue repeated over and over. The same goes for Power Of Goodbye very little attention paid to song writing. If you listen to a thirty second clip of these two tracks you've heard the whole thing. This album just strikes me as a major rip off of U2's POP, which also wasn't a very good album."
1,bad.,"I don't see why everyone is saying that Madonna came back, and that this is so good. Her title song, ""Ray of Light"" is stupid, and the sound effects sound like toilets flushing and heaven knows what else. ""Frozen"" is okay, but it leaves you thinking that maybe she did freeze while singing. Madonna is immoral in many ways, but her latest way is tricking people into buying an album that is nothing but some sounds she didn't even think up with her voice, which has not improved."
3,well-produced,"I must first say that Orbit did a phenomenal job on this album because it takes a lot to make songs with terrible lyrics sound good. I would say the best tracks are Frozen and Skin and the best parts are when she isn't singing. Don't get me wrong, she has a great voice, but it doesn't really fit on most of the songs excpet when it's toned down a bit. The title track has the best lyrics and conforms most closely to what she's done in the past. However, the rest of the tracks would sound better if sung by Lamb or Portishead in the more laid back vocal style associated with the electronica genre. It's a good start though, being an experimental album and all. I gotta respect Madonna's ability to adapt to the times and it's going to be fun to watch and see if Britney Spears will do the same... (not likely!)"
1,Oh joy! I'm the 288th person to review Ray of Light!,"People think Ray of Light is great and I don't get it. To me it just seemed like she put the electronic doodly-doo that's on ""Believe"" (one dang awful Cher tune). That Meat-Beat-Manifesto electronic slop was popular in 1993 dagnabbit! Oh and did you ever notice that she uses the same chord progression on EVERY DANG SONG!!! And the lyrics? Bleah. Same old lost love that we've been hearing for years. ""Love is a bird/She needs to fly"". What kind of lyric is that? Ever heard Negativland? They're cool. Buy their records instead. Or better yet, just get The Immaculate Collection. It really kicks amoebas."
1,Don't listen to the critics - this album is the pits!,"I can't believe that everyone is praising this album. Madonna is marketing it as 'electronica' when really all it sounds like is a heaping pile of the same old cheese pop she's been putting out for years.She repeats the phrase ""Your heart's not open"" in several songs, and resorts to putting out the same corny ballads that her fans eat up for whatever reason. Also, don't forget the use of the phrase ""lucky star"" - Madonna proves that she doesn't have any true inspiration either. This is adult contemporary music that no decent human should be subjected.Madonna was never really about music - anyone who liked her in the past did so because of her sexy image. Now she's a mother, ditched the sexpot thing for a lame new age thing, and anyone who hasn't before can see that all the songs are really pathetic. One of the worst albums of 1998."
1,"ACT YOUR AGE, MADONNA!!!!","You are not hip and you are not cool! I am sick and tired of hearing 40+ singers trying to catch the ""wave"" of what is cool. This CD only demonstrates that Madonna is going through yet another style change. Give it up, you haven't been cool since 1985, and you aren't going to be ever again!"
3,I tire of the ROL cult,"While Ray Of Light is a good album it's also the most overrated work in her catalouge. Droning, pretentious, and melodramatic are the words that come to mind whenever I listen to it. This album also has the distinction of containing not just the one, but the two worst songs she's ever recorded: ""Shanti/Ashtangi"" and ""Mer Girl."" Often dubbed her ""techno"" album it's most definitely not real techno so much as popified techno (which I prefer.) She gets flack for that but I don't recall her ever saying ""this is my purist techno album."" While there are some great songs on here: ""Frozen"", ""Ray Of Light"", ""The Power Of Goodbye"", ""Skin"", and ""Nothing Really Matters"" the album ranks 4th behind Like A Prayer, Erotica, and Bedtime Stories.Had she not fallen prey to the Kaballah cult maybe this album could have turned out to be the Like A Prayer of the 90's. How I long for the old Madonna who had more to say and spoke from her heart rather than reference their crap."
3,people please!,"This is just an over-hyped album! It might be the best one from madonna's repertoire but if you really wanna hear REAL electronic music go check out Xenakis, muslimgauze, and even diamanda galas' schrei X album.This is just pop electronic."
1,Where did Madonna go?,Maybe the answer would be...Buddah Buddah Land? Maybe just in the path of a really tasteless album? It contains songs with too much image and too little depthness. The album is miles and miles from reality. Just like the Madonna we now know.
5,"SHE""S GONE FROM MATRIAL TO SPIRTRAL GIRL,AND BETTER THAN EVE","I THINK PEOPLE THAT HATE MADDONNA ARE TIRED OF HER,BUT SHES CHANGED INTO A BETTER,CARING PERSON, AND SHE""S WAS EVEN LISTED IN THE GUNNISS BOOK OF RECORDS FOR THE MOST SUCSSEFUL ACTORESS AND SINGER EVER,AND I THINK ANYONE WHO WHO HAS WORKED SO HARD AT THEIR JOB DESEVES A PAT ON THE BACK. I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO START SEEING THE NEW MADDONNA AND NOT THE MATRIAL GIRL!"
5,Inspiring album and a drastic change from the last ones.,This album is the best she's ever done and I remember listening to it for almost ten months non stop. It's great to see that she's found herself. The album has great sound and the thing I like most about it is that it's weird and spiritual. I like all the songs and believe them to be a work of art. Very poetic!
5,Goal Reached!,"Madonna said that she wanted people to see that there can be emotion in techno music. It is really great to hear some new music from Madonna, with her new motherly image."
5,"Beyond the fame and the controversy, emerged a true artist","I first bought this album the day it was released and since that day this album has helped me deal with personal issues, such as a relationship that i couldn't sustain and the death of my mother.With this album Madonna truly emerges as an artist. Yes indeed, she did find her artistic integrity in ""Like A Prayer""(which also is a great album), but this one stated that Madonna is a human like the rest of us.Whenever i get asked what my favorite album of all time is, i don't hesitate to say ""Ray of Light"". As an audience we should feel privileged that Madonna did some soul searching and gave us a wonderful album. True that!!!If you haven't bought it, get off your [butt]... and experience the true genius of Madonna!"
4,A Beautiful Album!,"At first, I didn't really like this album of Madonna when I heard it. I was expecting it to sound more like ""Ray Of Light"" when I first played it and what I heard was the opening with a more slow song that started off nice and quiet. I didn't expect it to be that way at first, but then after a few years, I learned to like it, and now, it's one of my favorite Madonna albums! This is the first Madonna album I owned, and the songs on this album are fantastically brilliant! The first single, ""Frozen"" is one of my most wonderful favorites of all time and I still like it til this day! ""Ray Of Light"" is such a fantastically well-made song and I'm glad that the name of this song was this album's album title! Madonna does really well in singing these songs with emotion and power and I'm glad to have owned this album by Madonna.FAVORITE TRACKS:------------------""Ray Of Light""""Frozen""""Power Of Goodbye""""Nothing Really Matters""""Candy Perfume Girl""""Swim"""
2,I don't know what all the hype was about...,"When I first heard the song Frozen in March of 1998 I thought to myself...What the hell is this? When the album came out and I actually bought it, I found that the only two songs that I liked were Ray of Light and Mer Girl. This CD was not Madonna at all, and just another re-invention for her. She needed people to stll be interested with her so she went to the Spiritual look which definitely is NOT Madonna Ciccone! This is a bad CD and the songs aren't good. Erotica is Madonna..Ray of Light is NOT Madonna. Only buy it if you like a cheap imitaion of Spirituality..."
3,Nice...,"Nice music, but *cough* somebody's been listening to Tori Amos albums. Maybe some ZooTV period U2 in there, too."
3,Best Vampire Song Ever!,"I don't really care for this album all that much. However, there seems to be this immortality complex lurking throughout it. From the opening line ""I traded fame for love/without a second thought"" one has to wonder what is Madonna's subtext here. This album was obviously inspired by the birth of Lourdes and that rings clear in songs like ""little star,"" but my favorite song has to be the title track. The lyrics are so sinsterly gothic while the music is young enough to revive Madonna's vampiric career. She sings ""Then gone for/someone else to be there..."" Then I think I'm hearing ""Through the endless years."" I don't know why she covered that part up in the linear notes, unless she had something to hide, perhaps? Whatever the reason, the whole album makes me think Anne Rice whenever it comes into my life. She's flying, baby!"
2,"Not Tori, Not Alanis","The singles were catchy, but the rest is just that. William Orbit's backgrounds are just what you thought we'd be listening to in 1999, and I'm definitely going to flip to his page next. But as for the Queen of the 80's... sorry... I was waiting for the next female artisan-spirit to enter this talent-deprived music world and listening to the singles, I thought Madonna now had potential. But this album offers nothing to the listener. The lyrics are as generic as you'd expect from a team of four writers. Orbit made this album by himself and he should have stopped there... Madonna could have (and probably did) cut the vocals in 2-3 hours. Tremendous disappointment.Alanis is still by far the most talented artist on the Maverick label (by light-years), and Tori Amos is the Queen of the Keys. Nobody compares to these two ladies, and nobody appears to even be close."
1,"annoying,overrated,and pretencious","techno [poo] with pretensious lyrics. Don't get me wrong, I am a big Madonna fan, but this material just failed to live up to all the hype(and my personal expectations).I've really tried liking this cd,but after about a million listens,I just fail to see all the emotional depth,or perfect musical quality that everyone thinks this cd is full of. I just find it shallow, and just as bad with the like a virgin and material girl [poo] she started out with. Maybe it's just the fact that I SERIOUSLY dislike techno music, but that's not even the point. The melodies are totally dull,definately stuff we've heard before.the lyrics are childish and completely pretencious. I recommend all the rest of madonna's work(besides this, and of course the material girl,like a virgin [poop])"
1,"I'm sorry, Madonna fans, but...","....after having been fans of Madonna for years, we've had enough of hearing this queen of controversy, showing off her body just so she can win men and sell zillions of albums. Mother hates her now (except for some of her early works?), and I don't think she can sing. No matter how much she recovers from the attitude she used to have, it's apparent she'll never change."
2,the beinning of end for madonna why did she make it,"i think this cd was a backlash for madonna one for the reason why i think she made unlike gloria estefan 1994 hold me kiss me that cd did sale much as light of ray but cd bring gloria back on the radio this cd give brith to mrs spears the media knew that madonna try to made comeback this cd cause her fadeout . this cd sold more but it cause a backlash for her than a comeback madonna should have work with the magana cartain doing a tribute to rush i brought that cd after i brought her new cd .i thought she was on their that would have been very cool if madonna did Rush covers.go buy gloria estefan (gloria) it,s better than this one she fadeout 2 years later.but she did a better job."
3,"Uneven, brilliant and obnoxious","Some of the songs are are outstanding, like ""Frozen"" and ""The Power of Goodbye."" But really, Madonna's neither the first woman to have a baby nor the first to sing about it, and anyone who could possibly give a 5-star review to something as irritating as ""Shanti/Ashtangi"" has far more patience than I. History's going to judge this one as average."
2,A trite unimaginative disappointment - not worthy of her,"What happened to Madonna? Her latest album is really not worthy of her talents. The musicianship is amaturish and worse the lyrics are an embarrasment. I really don't want to hear about Madonna's discovery that the world does not revolve around her. I am happy she now has a child that she loves. Thank god she does just have herself to think about any more. Another embarrasment is the graphic overlayed on top of her photo in the CD booklet. Are we to understand that the ""Ray of Light"" is Madonna's nipple? This is really bad! Skip this one but give her another try later."
2,Like sand in my under pants.,"As much as i look forward to a day at the beach, I know that every good thing in life has a consequence. Being a Madonna fan I felt obligated to check out the new release.No matter how much I shifted and pulled I could not get comfortable with her hokey lyrics and stolen rhythms.don't waste your energy trying to get into it...it won't happen."
3,Not Madonna's greatest achievement,"The ""Mother Of Reinvention"" reinvented herself noticeably for this album, but unfortunately, that's not entirely a good thing in this case. Not that it's completely worthless (the title track, the beautiful ""The Power Of Goodbye"" and ""Little Star"" are all nice offerings), but this overlong album is largely uncharacteristic for Madonna, lacking the all-out feelgoodness of her first 2 albums and the robust maturity of ones like ""True Blue"" and ""Like A Prayer."" Her average singing ability is not at its best here, much of the album is bland both musically and lyrically, and it's filled with too many weird techno sounds that make it even more strange."
3,"No, this is NOT her best!","Why do people think it is her best? ""Bedtime Stories"" blows it out of the water! ""Erotica"" kicks it's butt! ""True Blue"" is even better! This is sooo not her best!"
5,Da Bomb! Gotta get your hands on it!,"""And I feel"" that this is the best CD of ALL! It's to Have and Not to Hold!(Which is hard). If any of you people are reading this, and just sitting there without the CD, well, for heaven's sake, get IT!"
2,It's good that Madonna has the special effects,"Because, truth is, she is a mediocre singer. Did you hear her on the Grammys? She was awful! And what is it with her overstressed ""R's"" in every song? Is she trying to sound country? This album has some good songs but it is due to William Orbit and the great techno infused music. Madonna is such a fake!"
4,Converted at last!,"Madonna never grabbed me until this one came out, but I'm a convert now! Maybe it has something to do with ""Evita"" and the work she put in for Alan Parker's film. Maybe I'm one of the few (in my part of the world anyway) to have seen that movie several times, enjoying the extent to which the director subverts an inane musical and catches the irony in a true tale of an ugly dictatorship and a nation's heroine-worship. In company like that, Madonna really learned to act, she learned to sing, and now she seems to have found herself (sometimes -- from motherly love to ""Mer Girl"" still sends shivers down the spine) and learned to do her own thing. How well she does it. I never thought I'd buy a Madonna album, let alone listen to it as much as I have, but then maybe I was ""Frozen"" too! ""Ray of Light"" is a lesson in surviving stardom. I hope Madonna's next tricks will be as different again. (I even bought ""Evita"", too; Madonna and the Parker magic remade it for me.)--""Le Loup"", Paris."
5,Bringing deep thoughts to space dance beats,"Ray of Light is Like a Prayer in an electronic mood, which is fine cause in my opinion the best artistic productions raise to the surface when the artists bring their feelings and personal journeys to the surface as well. I've always been a fan of her, and I think it'll carry on until I die..."
5,* Ray Of Light *,"This is definitely a ray of light to my CD collection. It's adventurous and atmospheric - definitely a great work.There are no low points to the album, every song is beautiful in its own way.This album is very well thought of, which is no surprise to me. It's a great work, very forward-thinking and definitely one of Madonna's best. If you are a fan of Madonna, or even if you're not, you should listen to this album. Simply amazing."
4,My favorite Madonna album,"I'm not a big fan of Madonna's music as I once was but Ray of Light remains my favorite album she has put out. A lot of the credit goes to producer William Orbit who provides a killer sonic background to her lyrics. I think it is Madonna's most mature effort she has put out and it shows in her lyrics. I like how subtle the dance beats are and how they allow Madonna's vocals to be front and center. The ballads on this album are the best that Madonna has ever done especially ""The Power of Goodbye"", ""Frozen"", and ""Skin"". Ray of Light is not a perfect album.There were a few tracks that I didn't care for but most of the album I love."
4,The Madonna record for people who used to hate Madonna,"This is a great record, due in no small part to William Orbit. Madonna has always been talented, but I never cared for her public image. This newly maternal side may just be another phase, but who cares? The woman knows how to entertain and do so with grand style. Ray of Light is chock full of grand melodies and she 'rawks' out if you can believe it.Favorite songs have to be Frozen and Swim. Madonna is pregnant again, so there's no telling what her next record will be like."
3,Madonna matures,"A noticeable difference in her voice came across in the 1996 hit ""You'll See"" - clearer and stronger. That 'improved' sound continued into this album release. Not only do you get an excellent cd cover, you get quite a range of interesting tracks which become better and better with each listen. Personal favourites include 'Substitute for love' where we see Madonna opting for guitar sounds rather than synthesizers. Other favourites include 'Power of Goodbye' and the 'feel good' title track. Except for a couple of tracks which don;t seem to fit in very well, the album is excellent and most fans will agree that she just gets better and better."
3,A little overrated and a little overcooked,"As big and devoted fan I am of Madonna's, I don't necessarily gush at everything she releases. Is Ray of Light a good album? Sure. Is it a masterpiece? Well, let time be the judge of that. It definitely has its moments (the whirligig title track, Swim, Little Star), but most of Ray of Light, I find, ironically, to be a dense affair bogged down by arty lyrics. If you want a masterpiece, check out Like a Prayer and come back to me in ten years if you want my final opinion on Ray of Light."
4,One of her best,"I love the first half of this album, however, the last few songs are not my favorites. Madonna, please take a hint, stop whining about your mother, it is getting OLD!"
4,Solid Groove,"After hearing the single ""Ray of Light"", I decided to give the rest of the abum a try. This is the first time I have ever purchased a Madonna product- and I am impressed. The album has heart and soul (with a dash of electronica blended in for a good measure). While I don't think that this album will turn me on to ""Like a Virgin"", I do think that Madonna has matured enough to turn a new audience of listeners on to her music."
4,Not da best but good enough,"I was never much of a fan of her's,but I've researched Madonna's musical history.Although this album is a masterpiece,it completely violates what music she used to do.I understand that it's her maternity album but the music isn't anything like I thought it would be.She gives techno music a new up-beat style,which I have been hoping for a long time.""Frozen"",""Ray of Light"",and ""Swim"" are my favorites.A new genre of music.Call it Madonna!!"
5,Madonna's Greatest:A Work Of Art,"This is an amazing album.It takes you places you never thought Madonna would take you.She finally seems to have exited the bedroom,put on her bathrobe and decided to write her memories of the past 15 years in the form of 13 songs.This is an extreme change from her old material.She sounds at peace,calmer,happier,more content with life.She credits the changes to her daughter,nicknamed Lola.It has techno dance beats but deep meaning and life experience.Madonna seems to have finally grown up."
4,"The C.D. is excellent, but not as upbeat as I expected.","Bringing techno into her music was a great idea. It makes her music different from everything that is out there. Her singing, as usually is spectacular and meaningful. I feel, though, she should have tried to make he music more upbeat and fun to listen to. For example the single ""Ray of Light""."
5,phenomenal,"it's sad that Madonna doesn't make CDs like this anymore. these songs have alot of heart and are spiritual. I also like her Erotica CD. Rain was great. Some of my favorites from this CD: frozen, substitute for love and power of goodbye"
3,Okay.,"I think that this album is pretty good but can be better.I think that most of her songs our a little long, but hey, there pretty good."
4,very good album,"This is another great upbeat dance album by Madonna! Highlights of the album are Nothing Really Matters, Little Star, and Ray Of Light. The disapointments of the album are Swim and Candy Perfume Girl. Nothing Really Matters, Ray Of Light, Skin, and Sky Fits Heaven are all great upbeat dance tracks. If you like dance, pop, electronica, techno, and/or disco, you should buy a copy! But, I would recommend Madonna's Bedtime Stories over Ray of Light."
5,You don't have to be a madonna fan to love this cd.,"This is by far her best work in over 10 years. Even if your not a big Madonna you'll have to give it up to her for producing, writing, and delivering one 1998 best orginal, new, and refreshing recordings. This one will stay in your cd changer for a long time and never get old."
4,superb!,"Like most CDs, it's rare to like all of the songs. Ray of Light however, is different. Catchy. Rythematic. Hypnotic. Threw me into a feverish trance...! Regardless of what people say about her, she's still got the look. She's still got the rythem going. You try to pump out hit after hit for well over a decade and still come out looking as fabulous as she! I say, wash your hair, grab your favorite drink, slide the CD into your sound system, hit ""repeat all"" and relax in your favorite chair."
1,garbage,"madonna has done it again jumped on a bandwagon 5 years too late. bjork has been doing ths at least that long, and she jumped on the bandwagon before madonna. this style of music isn't new and it makes me sick that everyoen thinks she is being innovative"
1,Luck,The luckiest Star of the twentieth century morphs into another play act while the masses of the plumbers dream worshippers buy buy buy
1,go back to yourself,YOU NO SHE WAS GREAT WHEN I WAS 2 YEARS OLD AND SHE WAS SINGING LIKE A VIRGIN AND SHE STILL WAS OK ON BEDTIME STORIES BUT THE NEW CD IS JUNK SO UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY DON`T BUY IT
1,"Cliche's, cliche's","That's about all there is to the song writing and theme of this album. Infact the words(more often than not) border on grade school level writing. ROL is all image with no substance. It doesn't offer anything new or original. As for the music, many of the songs have the same monotonous sound that goes nowhere. Emotional techno? Yes I've heard it, in fact it's very common. Unfortunately, you wouldn't know it listening to this insipid dreck."
3,"FUTURISTIC , INTERGALACTIC, PLANETARY ...","Why do so many people like this album? Is it a testimant of how shallow and robotic of a soceity we are becoming? There are some memorable songs on here however, frozen, nothing really matters ...... ummm, can't think of any others, oh yeah sky fits heaven is kewl.Madonna's best albums in my oppinion were here dance oriented, less self indulgant albums, erotica and bedtime story. Old skool still rulez! So all u robots out there take notice!"
5,Different But Good,"I must admit that I did like the early 90's Madonna better but this is great as well. All the neagtive comments on this page seem to say how Madonna is over 40 and she should act her age. Would people like her music better if she was 20? Just because she's older doesn't mean her music isn't good. Some of the best songs on this album are Skin, Nothing Really Matters and the title track. Definetely a great addition to anyone's CD collection."
2,No Thanx,"I didn't really like this C.D. because I think that Madonnahas no talent. The only reason I gaveit two stars instead of one is because she has catchy beats, and I have to give her credit for being able to fool all of the record companies into thinking her music is actually more than crap, which it's not."
1,Weak!,"This Cd of Maddy is really weak. I used to like a lot of her 80s songs when I was a kid. But this CD is getting so boring after not even one month. Madonna seems to be mysterious, but somehow it seems to be rather superficial."
5,HER LAST GOOD ALBUM BUT SHE NEEDS TO RETIRE.,I believe that this is the last cd by madonna which is actually worth buying because everything after this is horrible.The songs on here are really great because they have fantastic beats to them and her singing really sounds amazing.I really like this album and I would recommend any fan of hers to own this one and skip all her later efforts because they stink.She needs to retire now because shes lost her ability to make great music anymore and is selling out and becoming trendy now.
2,its terribly recorded,first of all i am a fan of madonna. the quality of her material over the years will stand the test of time. But i cannot listen to this cd because it is so badly recorded and overproduced. Themusic itself is quite good.
1,"Without a veil to hide behind, Madonna truly shows her flaws","I can't believe that everyone is praising this album. Madonna is marketing it as 'electronica' when really all it sounds like is a heaping pile of the same old cheese pop she's been putting out for years. She repeats the phrase ""Your heart's not open"" in several songs, and resorts to putting out the same corny ballads that her fans eat up for whatever reason. Madonna was never really about music - anyone who liked her in the past did so because of her sexy image. Now she's a mother, ditched the sexpot thing for a lame new age thing, and anyone who hasn't before can see that all the songs are really pathetic. One of the worst albums of 1998."
1,I got two words for Madonna: You Suck,I hate Madonaa and her stupid Ray of Light. Madonna take music lessons. I hate to sing and I can sing better than you with leringitis
3,Sky Fits Heaven,"Madonna said, ""I love Techno music, but you never really think of it as emotional, I wanted to make it emotional."" In many of the songs, especially ""Little Star"" and ""Sky Fits Heaven"", it was as if she was speaking from her heart and soul, not groin. My favorite songs were ""Little Star"", ""Ray of Light"", ""Candy Perfume Girl"" and ""The Power of Goodbye"". Unlike many of her pop counterparts, only Madonna can reinvent herself so well."
2,"OK, but not a big deal,really","I don't know why everybody is making such a big deal of Madonna. OK, she's not bad. This CD is OK, but not overwhelming at all. After 2weeks it falls on your nerves."
2,Where's the variety?,Personally I thought most of these songs all sounded the same. Ray of Light was the only song I really liked. I expected more from one of the leading artists in the music industry.
5,Her Most Significant and Meaningful Recording,"Society will both villify and adore someone who publicly expresses what we all repress. I found it interesting that the reviews were either love or hate for the most part. Madonna has been a public symbol of the trasnformation that we all experience in our lives and I feel that fact endears her to us all. I love this CD ""Ray of Light"". I have appreciated her talent for a long time, but this one is special. Her lyrics are reflective and inspiring. The music is unique and powerful. Like a ray of light, it is refreshing to see her true being expressed. The words to frozen are so true and compelling. You can clearly see that she has been doing some spiritual studies. I look forward to discovering what she has in store for us next.DRB"
2,not so good,"There are three decent tracks on here (Ray of Light, Frozen, Power of Goodbye) but not much else. ""True Blue"", ""Like a Prayer"" and ""The Immaculate Collection"" are Madonna's truly great albums. This one, however, is a disappointment."
5,Each song captures your emotions,"After hearing all four of Madonna's singles from her Ray of Light album, I finally decided it was worth buying. I am always worried that when I buy a cd for one song, the others will be horrible. Atleast on this album, there were four that I liked, right? Wrong. When I listened to the other tracks, I found each one to be as beautiful as her singles on TV. I recommend this album to anyone who likes to hear great music and a wonderful voice."
5,MADONNA AT HER BEST!,"Madonna's best album yet! With interesting lyrics, mystical vocals and unique musical arrangements, she has never sounded better. A great album and a must for everyone's music collection!"
5,This could easily be the best cd Madonna has made yet!,I love this cd it rocks everyone should buy it because you're guaranteed to love it!
5,Still the queen!,She's done it again! Wonderfull album. People say it's different from what she did before. It's not! The more you listen to it the more you see through the bleeps and electronica. Madonna has always been about great popsongs! Best songs are those she's written with Pat Leonard who also co-wrote the best stuff on Like a Prayer. Long live the queen!!!
5,Madonna Does It Again,"Since she first emegred into the music world, Madonna has been a fashion icon, celeberity icon and of course a music icon! There is nothing she won't try to do-and this new album has an ecletic variety of sounds, which only Madonna is brave enough t try. She is just great and this alubm is too! So many people critize her, but she once again rises above those small people and comes out on top."
5,Excellant...shows Madonna's evolution as an artist.,"Ray of Light may seem different and a little strange at first, but this is where its charm lies. Madonna isn't afriad to try new things, unlike most artists, and she does it with vigor, strength and above all else- style. Most impressive is her vocal evolution, the voice is much stronger now."
2,I was disappionted,"I liked ""Candy Perfume Girl"" ""Frozen"" and ""Little Star"" but can't help thinking to myself: had this album had been put out by an unknown artist or incognito, it never would have been noticed -I can't say that about Madonna's other works."
2,Disappointing.,"Yeah, I like Madonna, but the songs on this CD were not that great. I like only three songs on this CD: #1 (Drowned World/Substitution for Love), #8 (Shanti/Ashtangi), and #9 (Frozen). I bought the CD after hearing ""Frozen"" on the radio, and was overall very disappointed. I hope no one else makes the mistake I did of buying this CD after hearing only one or two songs."
5,Not to gush--but what else is there to say?,"Madonna has yet again proven herself to be a very versatile musician, with her soulful lyrics and heavenly vocals. I think that it is great that she is venturing into the world of dance/techno music, and that she is just challenging herself to be different from most pop artists. Every song on this record captivates the listener, and you can't help singing the hook for the rest of the day. With ""Ray of Light"", Madonna has truly shown that she has survived the test of her 14 years in the music industry--and with shining colors."
2,Where's my lucky star??,I don't think people who like Madonna in 80's will enjoy this album.I'b better buy Immaculate Collection or Like a Virgin. Why can't we have fun like we did in the 80's?
5,She still is the QUEEN OF POP,"The cd is simply brilliant. IT IS CLEARLY the best since Like a Prayer. GO BUY THIS CD, MADONNA SOUNDS GREAT. SONGS: Power of Goodbye is great."
4,Madonna is evolving,Ray of light is hopefully just one step in the development of Madonna. Compared to her earlier work there's definitely going on something. I agree with some people saying that it's not all that special. Let's wait for her next step.
4,"Madonna's best since ""Like a Prayer""","This is by far one of the best pieces of works Madonna has ever completed. It really is a ""Piece of Work"", the whole album fits together perfectly (with the exception of the annoying ""Candy Perfume Girl"", which downgraded my rating from 5 stars to 4). ""Frozen"" and ""Drowned World"" are absolutly fabulous and stand out as the best songs on the album."
5,Madonna is a true artist!,My new favorite CD! This and Erik Quisling's new book THE ANGRY CLAM are the two best purchases I've made in months!
5,On of the top five best records ever...,Ray of Light is an impressive and astonishing achievement. What can a woman who just became a mother have to offer to us young people? A great dance album that at the same time has amazing ballads and an exciting electronic sound combined with deeply personal songwriting. The best of the year.
3,Its all good. i mean a fair reviev,"I have never liked Madonna that much, but when i heard the song ""frozen"" i really liked it. The cd is good except for like 3 or4 songs but i think the it is not a waste of money and its for people who like the wacked type of music. I listen to ska and punk and rock and all other kinds of music except for country, and classical. So go buy the madonna cd, you might be dissapointed but you might not."
5,"Madonna at 40, at her best","After (...), fans have wondered if Madonna was ever going to tone it down, and she proved that with a turn-around hit album ""Ray of Light."" This is probably her best album, with her new found persona of celebrating her 40s and bringing spirituality, yoga, deeper lyrics, abstract thoughts, and new dance grooves. ""Skin"" is perhaps her new [attractive] ode from ""Justify My Love"" and ""The Power of Love"". Her lyrics were more personal (""I traded fame for love, without a second thought/It all became a silly game, some things cannot be bought), and ""Swim"" is perhaps one of my personal favorite lines ""Children killing children while the students rape their teachers/Comets flying across the sky while the churches burn their preachers"". Her lyrics are rawer than ever and her praise is well-deserved."
1,"Corny , didn't deserve a grammy","I don't get all the five star reviews. There's not much cutting edge about this album. Yeah it sounds good, but there's isn't anything unique about the song writing. Plus, most of the music is adult contemporary, no real dance tunes except ROL. The album is OK, but no classic. I mean ""your frozen if your hearts not open"". Come on! I know people in my neighborhood who could write better lines than that."
1,I didn't know Madonna could be boring.,No matter how much you like Madonna I would not recommend this album to you. She tries way too hard to sound older and spiritual and just turns out sounding boring and crappy.
1,It sucks,"This whole album is just Madonna complaining about how people mistreat her and how smart she thinks she is. Her singing stinks, and so does her attitude. Does she really think people should be impressed it took her until she was fortysomething to realise money and fame don't buy happiness? I knew that before I was twelve."
1,Lite wanna-be electronica,This album is a perfect example of what Madonna is good at. She manipulates the most popular current style of music and applies her faux intellectualism and musical background to fashion it into something as her own. It is like taking in a lost dog and feeding it out of you own dog's plate. The sources for this type of music are far better than this run-off of drainage electronica.
1,"one good song, the rest sound similar, all kind of slow","madonna's music is often unique. Much is dancable, and much is easy enough to sing along with. This new album goes away from that. Only one song on the cd sparked a fire in me."
1,Not good.,Madonna is not good. this is her worst music ever. she can't sing at all. she should retire. she's old she can't perform at all. she made a fool out of herself this past year with her crapy tv performances. No wonder she decided not to tour.
2,Get Original!!! This whole album sounds like 80's Erasure,"I do like some songs, but frankly, I think Erasure does better music."
2,"Liked it the first time, when it was called ACHTUNG BABY","A big disappointment. Ray of Light is the ONLY song with any energy at all; the others are limp, ""introspective"" wet noodles. I'm a huge fan and ran to the store the first day this came out, but I'm sorry I need to dance and this doesn't deliver. Also the resemblence to U2 is blatant and stale."
5,Madonna Electronica!,"It is 1998 and she is back with the best album of her career. Ray of Light is full of haunting ballads (Frozen) , groovy dance songs (Ray of Light, Skin) and electro style lullaby's (Little Star). This is a must for ALL Madonna fans. Go buy it now and see what all the fuss is about!"
1,What the...?,"Madonna didn't used to be this bad. I recall the song ""I'll Remember You"" being somewhat good...However, this CD (And the Ray of Light video) just don't match up to the standards Madonna used to have."
1,Frozen and No Place to Thaw,"I thought the fact that ""Ray of Light"" won Madonna her first ""real"" Grammy Awards meant this album had something to offer music fans. If you like Britney Spears, Hanson, Brandy, you'll love this! Lots of electrical shorts, an incessant beat, no real melodies or significant lyrics of any kind."
1,This Cd isn't much of anything,"Infact ROL comes of as rather tired and fake. The vocals are poor and the lyrics are manufactured with nothing real to digest. Not innovative or inspiring, just another manufactured career move."
1,BORING!!!,"This is the best Madonna album? Her beats are retreads on earlier material by other better artists. Her lyrics are typically self-centered and she still cannot sing. Get ""Erotica""."
4,Two Madonnas,"I liked ""Frozen"" and ""The Power of Goodbye"" more than Madonna's usual stuff. I liked the rest of the songs on this album less than her earlier songs. The lyrics of ""Frozen"" and ""The Power of Goodbye"" are just great. As to the rest of the songs, their techno energy is just not the same as the real, raw passion of the younger Madonna. These things are a matter of taste, of course. This album is both a mature and polished Madonna and a valiant techno effort."
4,some really creative work on this CD,"swim, candy perfume girl, ray of light, frozen, power of goodbye and little star are some of madonna's most experimental music of her career in which there are sophisticated songwriting, electronica, r&b and dance music combined with unique sounds and fabulous videos for the songs mentioned that were released. Getting the album for these songs alone is worth it, believe me!"
5,An exellent Album!!,"Ray of light is an emotional aquatic music album.When I hear the song Swim I feel like I 'm in the middle of the ocean. My favorite songs are Swim, Candy Perfume Girl, Sky Fits Heaven and ray of light. If you liked this album you'll probably like her new album ""Revenge"". The song ""Revenge"" is the best of the album I also lkie ""Love Affair"" and ""CyberraGA"""
4,"A great book, where is it?","This is a great book on the Colonel's life. It's an easy great read. I would recommend it along with ""Grinding it Out"" by Ray Croc (the McDonald's Story.) and Dave's Way also (Wendy's Story.) I would recommend it to all who work in the fast food industry. All of these are easy reads and you learn about the fast food industry and the ability of people to create something great."
4,"The stories the spawned the ""classics"".","Sometime between going from a magazine writer to a schlock B-movie maker himself, writer/director Jim Wynorski put together this collection of short stories that served as the basis for numerous classic and cult classic movies. For any B-movie buff this book is required reading just to see how close (or far) the adaptations kept to the source stories. Especially noteworthy is John Campbell's Who Goes There, it will give you an added appreciation to John Carpenter 1982 film version of the tale. Great stuff. Find it, buy it, read it."
5,This is one great game,This game is very good but there are better games out there. Also if you consider yourself very good at video games then rent this game first because chances are you will get sick of it. Other than that this game is great.
5,the best game EVER made,"The amount of words you can use in this space is too little to even begin to describe how great this game is, The trick system is great, the graphics are Unbelievable, the courses are laid out really well, the characters are awesome. even if you dont skateboard you will love this game, go out and buy it if you dont already have it."
2,Controls are too hard,"The controls are too hard for me. If you have a Playstation or a N64, get the game for that. If not, skip this game. I think Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 would be 3 stars. Don't get this game!"
2,bad game,"I was convinced that this was a great game by all the good reviews, so I got it thinking it was worth the money... But guess what, IT'S NOT! It may be fun in the begining but after a few days, after you get used to the controls, it's just the same boring thing over and over again. So take my advice and skip this one."
5,The best skater ever made,"Tony Hawk on Dreamcast hasn't changed anything from the playstation version except for better graphics but thats great.Tony Hawk has some of the best graphics I've ever seen and the gameplay keeps you playing.But if you have the playstation version of Tony Hawk you basically have this version.Still after playing this game one time you instantly get addicted and you won't stop playing till you beat all the levels.Tony Hawk offers many different modes and if you have a friend over play horse its amazingly fun.The best thing about this game is the value Tony Hawk never stops being fun even after playing it over and over .Don't buy any of the other imitators of Tony Hawk get this game now ,it's worth your money"
5,Must buy 4 Dreamcast Owners,"I heard some people say this game stinks but thatz cuz they don't respect it as the original. They've just been spoiled by THPS3 which is obviously the best game yet, but for the first shot at a THPS game this 1 was a sucess! The Dreamcast version also has improved graphics & sound quality with the same good gameplay as PlayStation."
4,Amazing!,"Amazing! That's the word that best describes Tony Hawk's Pro Skater! When I first heard of this game I thought: How much fun could a game be where all you do is ride around on a stupid skateboard? A lot of fun, was the answer I got when I finaly rented the game to try it out. I never knew you could have so much fun just riding a skateboard in a video game! This game is one of the best out there, the only thing keeping it from getting five stars is that the graphics are not that much better from the Playstation version and do not take advantage of the Dreamcast's power."
5,Time to catch some phat air!,"I'll just say this--I rented it, and an hour later I had Kozmo delivering my own copy. This game is incredible. If you like hardcore skating, you have to get this game!Of course, if you can wait, you really should buy it ......................"
5,Great Game!,I got this game 3 days ago and I love it. The 2 player modes are awesome. The single player modes are good as well. Plenty of hidden characters and levels to send you coming back for more. Go get this game now!
1,Never again,"I bought the canon ip80, the canon ip90 and finally the canon ip90v because of the portability. All of them failed long before the should have. I will never buy a canon product again. They are marketed to be mobile but they cannot survive the simplest trips. At this point (after 4 pritners in a year) it is cheaper to go back and use the business center at the hotel no matter what it costs. At least I don't have to carry a broken printer in my breifcase or luggage."
4,Great Versatile Compact Photo Printer,"Great Printer, Had Canon BJC-80 with scanner and love it but new laptop didn't have printer ports anymore only USB. So I decided to get another Canon, this time with Blue Tooth, The Old one had Infrared so it was wireless too. Keep the quality products coming Canon!"
3,Canon IP90v,I love these little printers and the quality they produce. However this is my third model because they simply wear out! I am now using the IP100 model. I also wish you could put in a larger ink cartridge.
4,"Too Bad...Otherwise, Very Good","All I have to say is, I really love the printer, other than, the door hinge did indeed break early on. I've tried to glue it, but after 5 different times of fixing it and having it break again, I am now searching to see if a new door is available, and what extra cost I'll have to pay. Still, not sorry I purchased the printer, as the size and operation are perfect for our business needs."
1,software nightmare,The unit is a great size and I like its size. However the installation was a nightmare and I eventualy gave up. If it takes this much energy to install the soft ware it makes me nervous for the future computer conflicts. Also I was disapointed that the unit did not come with a USB cord to attach the printer to the computer
1,not as advertised,"My printer arrived, minus two critical components: 1) no usb cable--nice if manufacturer told me--I could have at least ordered one right away, and 2) no color ink cartridge. Printer doesn't work without it (obviously). So here I sit. Easier just to go to Best Buy and purchase one than to screw around with Amazon or Canon. I'm very displeased with the unnecessary hassles."
4,Nice Printer,"This portable printer was exactly what I was looking for. The HP 400 series were too bulky for my backpack.Pros: Size is great. The picture quality is great. Easy to install. The battery lasts long, even thought you must purchase it separately.Cons: Very slow to print. I personally had no problem with the speed of print, but it is slower than most other printers."
4,Canon picture printer,"This printer is great. It is compact but prints clearly and precisely. The colors reflect real life. It prints quickly and although the cartridges are tiny, they last a while."
2,"Nice printer, but didn't last long","Purchased less than two years ago, and it stopped printing in black ink (only color). Take a look through [...] and find out how many other people had this exact same issue!After getting in touch with Canon, they were able to provide a discount on a new printer. Servicing this one did not make sense given that the diagnostic fee from the authorized Canon service center was $80+. Worked great for the time that I had it though."
4,Canon ip90,"This is a great little printer for dragging around. I am a home inspector doing on site printing. The only drawback I see is that I get about 40 pages per black cartridge, however the tanks are cheap and small, I just have to carry several for when they run out. Other than that it is small, light weight, and works great. I print mostly text and mostly black, not any photos except my logos. I do not yet use the wireless or battery options but expect to in the future."
4,"Great portable printer, except for one thing...","I received this printer as a Christmas gift from my parents, since I admired their same model. Printing speed, resolution, and color look just as good as my larger HP Photosmart. The size and weight make for relative ease in mobility; it fits nicely in my school bag. The only issue I have with the printer is not with the printer, it's with Canon. For the price of this printer ($319 original price), I would think they could throw in a USB cable. Other than the inconvenience of an additional trip to the Radio Shack, the printer is great."
4,cannon pixma ip90v,Easy to use and prints quick. Have not tested the blue tooth technology. A little heavy for transporting. Overall 4 star.
5,Great wipers,"Honestly, I didn't really need new wipers, and had no intention of buying them. The only reason I bought these was to push my order above the amount that would get me free shipping.That said...these are amazing wipers! They clean SO much better than the cheaper ones you typically get at an auto parts store. And they last much longer, too! I'll be buying these again next time when these finally do wear out. Highly recommended!June 2010 update: Two years later, Bosch has changed these wipers, and I can no longer recommend them. Whatever they did, has caused the wipers to last only two to three months before streaking and needing replacement. The guy at the nearby NAPA store has said the same thing - he no longer recommends them to his customers."
5,"Lex Orandi, Lex Crendi","I came across Praying the Catechism as I was looking for different ways to incorporate the richness of my Catholic faith into my everyday life. At times the Catechism of the Catholic Church can be difficult to approach but I find this book opens up the simple beauty of the faith in very user-friendly way. Designed to compliment the four pillars of the faith, the daily meditations provide a wonderful beginning point for internalizing, through prayer, what we believe."
4,Works for me,"Have tried using MP3 player and Sirius Satellite Radio. Key is to use the best open FM frequency and maximize the output settings on the input device - seems to work just fine then. Had the ""underwater"" affect on the MP3 player until we cranked up the volume - then all was well. Not bad for under $30."
1,WARNING -- DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"The idea was great and still is great.but not this product. it's horrible.What was SIIG thinking?Signal strength is very weak and there's constant background noise. The sound quality is absolutely horrible and not acceptable to most people. It comes with an audio cable to connect from the wireless card to an audio device. it fits very loosely and it makes sound quality even worse. also the whole unit is extremely sensitive to touches and bumps. every time i hit a bump, i end up loosing signal and have to readjust connections.if you're trying to get this to play music, this is not the one.I don't even know how SIIG got this to work up to 10 Meters.the farthest distance mine worked was 1 meter.if you still cannot resist and absolutely have to try this product, buy it from a local store with a generous return policy.good thing i bought this from a local store. i'm taking back tomorrow."
3,A Stooges Fan Must Have,"The latest installment of the Three Stooges Collection (Volume-7)is not the best of the lot, however it contains the two rare 3D shorts "" Spooks"" and ""Pardon My Backfire"" which are worth the price of admission. Most of the volume contains remakes, but there are certainly a few gems in there that are worth having for your collection."
4,Not the Last of Shemp,"Volume 7 will not be last of Shemp. Yes he died suddenly in November 1955, but this volume goes through the end of 1954! Hence, there are 16 more shorts with Shemp, which were released through 1956. Then we have the 16 with Joe Besser. As a guess, these 32 will comprise the last volume, unless Sony splits them down the middle. This volume 7 also includes the worst Stooge short of all time - Coo Coo on a Choo Choo - even though it was Larry Fine's favorite. I look foward to this volume and the remaining 32 shorts."
2,3D titles are mis-encoded horribly!,"Bought this solely for the 3D shorts that everyone is raving about (usually BEFORE the set was even released)...on MY copy the two 3D shorts are in interlaced format instead of progressive scan like the rest of the disk, and they screwed something up in the process...the video is HORRIBLY grainy with SEVERE interlace artifacts....WTH? Hoping they corrected this...contacting Sony today about it...what a disappointment."
2,Shame on you Sony,"I must give Sony credit for including the 2-D and 3-D versions of Spooks and Pardon My Backfire. But come on Sony! The 3-D encoding is awful! Horrible digital grain as well. Not to mention, what's with the magenta and green encoding?! Sure that is one way to do it but red-blue is standard with the anaglyph format. Glasses are not included either. Lucky for us, the 2-D versions are there. So... I used DVD shrink, ripped the tittles, opened up my Xilisoft 2-D to 3-D video converter program and BAM! Burned it onto DVD, threw on my standard red-blue 3D glasses and it looks amazing. Why is it that I did all of this on my crappy PC home computer in about an hour and a studio like Sony can't get it right? The only reason I bought Stooges vol. 7 is for the 3-D titles that I enjoyed as a kid. I'm glad I was able to remedy the situation."
4,Shemp to the rescue,"Vol. 7 of 'The Three Stooges' collection continues with the 'Shemp' years. I've always liked Shemp, and in his own way, I think, is just as funny as his brother, the great 'Curley'! This set contains, probably, the last of the good Shemp's, but I sincerely hope the series continues right through to the final shorts with Joe Besser, who stood in after Shemp's sudden death!With all the current 'hype' about the resurgence of 3D, it would seem a good idea that the two shorts made in that format, are included here, pity they just don't work over TV? With the glasses included in the set, they just come over as 'crap', better enjoyed in the regular 2d format, thankfully, also included here! It may just be that 3D doesn't come across well on TV? I've never seen any that really work on TV? But, that slight 'hiccup' aside, Vol. 7 is still a strong enough entry to warrent good sales! Keep going!"
4,"Good, but On the Decline","I'm total satisfied with how Sony has released this collection. I really commend them for putting every short in the volumes, however this is when the shorts start to decline. Overall, the dvd is good. The shorts are restored to really good quality and they have included a couple of 3D shorts. It also comes with two pairs of 3D glasses which is nice. Most of the shorts included with this volume are recycled shorts already made with Shemp and even some Curley shorts with Shemp in his place. Still a good one to add to the collection."
2,"SO PRETTY, but not sturdy","This ring is so pretty, I got so many comments on it. But it's not very sturdy or strongly made. I slipped my hand into a file cabinet and the ring caught on a file folder and snapped right in half! I was so upset because it's so pretty and I loved wearing it. So my advise would be - wear when you're not working!"
2,not good quality,"I purchased this ring only to return it. It's a beautiful ring, but the quality is not very good. It says it is adjustable, but when I tried to tighten it, it sounded like it was cracking. I thought it would break in half. It felt like a plastic ring, rather than sterling silver."
4,To All New Paintballers,"Yes this lens looks sweet, but do not put the cart before the horse. I made the mistake of ordering this item and figured that the ""Elite"" meant nothing. Well, Elite means the style of JT mask so just keep that in mind. I thought Amazon mislead me on this purchase. I bought the JT Flex 8 and underneath of that item, this lens was listed. I just figured it would fit. Stupid Me"
2,Goggle lens,This lens won't fog up but it is very difficult to install and clean. I'd recommend going to some other brand of facemask that has a quick release lens.
3,Hilarious Piece of Propoganda,"This is an old movie - 1949. And not a particularly good movie either. It felt like more of a propaganda piece than a real movie. The overriding message was: State Department officers bravely serve America abroad. The acting was terrible and the storyline thin and predictable. It was good for some laughs at how outrageous it was though.Also, if it was an accurate portrayal of Foreign Service Officers back in 1949, it is not now. They don't carry guns and they don't single handedly take on Mongolian warlords. Anyway, an interesting movie and fun piece of history if not cinematic excellence."
3,17th Century Soap Opera,"Deborah Moggach's Tulip Fever reads like a soap opera from the 17th Century: characters are on the surface, motives are obvious but hidden, and plots are far out. But, like many soap operas, it's an enjoyable, guilty little pleasure. Take it for what it's worth: a compelling and quick read, with a little geographical and historical education thrown in. In short, the book is worth the short amount of time you need to invest in it."
3,Doomed lovers oddly boring,"I just couldn't feel very sympathetic to the doomed lovers in this book. It was clear that they WERE doomed all the way through, but I didn't really care about them. I thought that Sophia was callow and superficial, leaving her adoring husband for a guy that didn't seem to have any attractive qualities. Cornelis's only sin seemed to be that he was older than her. I just wasn't very interested in these characters or their dilemma"
4,she's a master,"I think Deborah Moggach is a master of misdirection. It really fascinates me how she can lay something so obvious right in front of your nose but then prevent you from seeing it. I don't always engage with her characters deeply, but I always like the mind of the writer behind what I'm reading."
4,A Tale that Blossoms,"Appearing at first to be shallow, predictable, and simplistic, Tulip Fever blossoms into a rich tale of passion and deception. A full cast of characters that includes a maid in a difficult situation, a servant who can't be trusted, and a doctor with regrets, all play a role in the deception planned by the two lovers. Moggach acquaints us with the ambitions, dreams, passions and disappointments of the characters which enable the deception planned by the two lovers to stand a chance at success. Although the tulip trade is not the central focus of the book, Moggach skillfully weaves it into the tale along with the cultural mores and frustrations of Amsterdam society and draws a clever parallel between tulip fever and the risks that people are willing to take to achieve happiness. Despite what I would consider to be an implausible relationship between the characters, I found Tulip Fever to be fascinating look at human nature and what drives people to do astonishing things."
2,ok I guess,"This was one of the last books I had read during my ""dutch"" phase (i.e Girl in Hyacinth Blue, Girl with Pearl Earring, Coffee Traders..) so maybe I was getting bored with the period. Or maybe I can't imagine people getting so invested - emotionally and financiall - in tulips.The ending was too...easy. I usually hate a sad ending but since I didn't really like Sophia I would have preferred something darker at the end."
3,"written for the screen, not the book club","I was hoping for a good, historical novel that would give me a sense of both Amsterdam and the tulip market in the 1600s. Instead, I got a made-for-the-screen romance, with Amsterdam and tulips merely props. The book did draw me in, but it was very light-weight. It took my book club about 5 minutes to discuss it, and all any of us could say was whether we liked it."
1,Ludicrous and offensive!,"As an art historian, I found this book ludicrous and offensive! (...) but THIS book is just a smutty attempt at historical fiction. I couldn't finish, I was too disgusted."
2,too precious,"There seem to be one of a raft of books set during the Dutch era of tulip speculation. (I assume this has some weird link to our own era of dot-com excesses.) As a guy who reads mainly women authors, even I found it too chick-flicky (although, admittedly, I only got a third of the way through). The epigraphs were distracting. I'm surprised other people found the sex offensive -- that was the best part. I think that Gregory Maguire's ""Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister"" is a much more compelling treatment of the same era."
3,A Mediocre Read,"I found this book to be a bit of a disappointment. The writing was too simplistic and the character development was mediocre at best. However, the time period in The Netherlands provided an interesting backdrop. It was a quick read, and I was happy to be finished!"
5,A Fascinating Tale,"I have to say that I was quite surprised in that this book was a last minute choice of mine from the reduced table at Barnes & Noble. The pithy but elegantly exact language made this story intriguing and enjoyable. No, it's not Austin or Bronte prose, but the ebb and flow of description and dialogue draws one in and before one can really settle in, the story has reached its ultimate climax. With its numerous scriptural references, it is somewhat like a parable. All the ingredients are there: Love, deceit, greed, adultery, repentance, and redemption. The twists and turns of the author gives flavor to events that has the tulip mania of Holland of the 17th century as its backdrop. A good read that has brevity of language but a richness of content, a miniature gem if not delicate flower."
2,Tulip Fever,"Just didn't hold my interest but, for what it was (period piece taking place in Amsterdam)...well written. I did truly love ""Marigold Hotel"" so assumed I'd enjoy this as well."
3,I'd like to know more...,"After I saw ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"", I wanted to read the book which occasioned it. The movie is ""Hollywood"": entertaining and enjoyable, but Deborah Moggach's original is darker and much more thought provoking. Of course, it was a short step from there to anything else she'd written. I'm of Dutch descent, and I've become interested in the period when ""tulipomania"" gripped The Netherlands. The Dutch care passionately about both tulips and religion, and I find it hard to believe that the main characters in this story would have ever married--at that time. I found the pace of this book too slow in the third quarter, but the ending is magnificent!"
4,Character studyy,"In addition to being and engrossing read, ""Tulip"" has a lot to say about the human condition. It looks into individuals, and manages to sepaparate how they appear from how they actually are,and lets you really examine how ordinary people create fictions of their own lives that are at odds with how they actually feel and how they actually live. I feel the author did a masterful job,and I would certainly look forward to any new work by her."
1,Boring!,"I love historical fiction, but you have to be a fourth grade girl to appreciate this cliche, slow-paced story about a serving girl in love with a painter. The rich, vivid setting is not done justice in the least, as the story mostly takes place in one house, and the historical magnitude of the events of the Golden Age are barely mentioned. It's disappointing overall, and not worth the read."
1,Tulip Fever,"Admittedly, I did not get beyond page 27, but this is a Harlequin romance in disguise. The offensive sexual content was enough to make me stop reading (at page 27 no less). This was recommended to me because I also bought Artemisia, which is an excellent read. The two couldn't be more different. Artemisia actually told a story, but the plot in Tulip Fever took a back seat to the sexual exploits of the book's main characters.Don't be fooled by packaging or other reviews. If you like romance novels, this is for you. If not, you will be disappointed."
3,not particularly memorable,"Speedy little novel about a young married woman, Sophie who falls in love with the painter who has been commissioned by her husband to paint them.I found this novel rather predictable, and didn't really accept or understand Sophie's love for Jan, it didn't seem 'real'. The added pictures throughout the book gave the story an authentic air, however, I enjoyed ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"" much more."
5,Exit 747 Will Get You Hooked,"I first heard Tim ""Love"" Lee late one night when ""Exit 747"" started playing on an acid jazz college radio show. The song started out in the odd way it does, but, by the end, I was hooked. I proceeded to spend about two weeks trying to track down the album, but it was worth it.It has less dance music than Lee's earlier album, but what it lacks in dancing, it makes up for in being one of the greatest late-night road trip albums in history.Honestly."
5,Go Reiner!,"The Reiner/CSO recordings are some of the greatest of all time, and this one follows suit. He was a tyrant, but there's no doubt he got every last ounce of playing out of the Chicago Symphony. The rhythmic accuracy and sense of control is uncanny throughout, with impeccable playing from the brass section."
4,Mussorgsky. Pictures at an Exhibition,This was purchased as a gift. I know nothing about this music but the recipients were satisfied with the CD. Additional CD's may be purchased in the future.
5,MY FIRST BEATLES ALBUM,I oreded this cd because I was allowed to sample online. When it does come the entire disc will be put on my instumel-mix ipod.
2,Untrue representation of what was being sold,"THe picture of the book advertised is the edition I wanted. What arrived was an earlier edition. While the book's contents are fine for the purpose, I don't appreciate the deception about what was being offered. If a picture of the cover of the earlier version was unavailable to paste in, then there should have been a clear indication that it was the earlier edition that was being offered for same."
1,marketing without instruction,Mr Mclean's book on the golf swing is poorly written for the novice with 10% of the book devoted to why he is a great instructor. Throughout the book he uses jargon that is never defined (no glossary). For someone trying to learn a golf swing this is not the right book.
4,A good overview of 90's-era Kurdish politics,"The content of the book includes a very brief generic history chapter, with chapters analyzing the events of the 90's. I think the analysis chapters do a relatively good job of handling the material and I found nothing that appeared factually inacurate based on my other readings. The scope of the book is very brief, limited to the 90's, but concise and to the point.This is an informative book that would make a nice contribution to the reference collection of a regional specialist like myself, but it does not cover enough generalized history of material to be helpful to a random person wanting to learn more about the Middle East or the Kurds. Try the Modern History of the Kurds by David McDowall or After Such Knowledge, What Forgiveness? by Jonathan Randall."
1,CRASH PRONE HUNK OF JUNK,"I have been working on computers since 1975. I have seen some awful programs, including some that I have written. This is the single most crash prone piece of software I have ever had the misfortune to use. No mater what you do, it WILL crash. It WILL corrupt HOURS of work and leave you with no option but to delete the file and start over again.USE ANYTHING BUT THIS SOFTWARE"
1,Total Garbage,My computer crashed multiple times. Frustrated I looked for online reviews to see if it was my computer or the software. Well..it is the program...this is a joke. Don't even bother.
1,Horrible DO NOT BUY !!!,I am designer & programmer w/25 years experience. This software does NOT work. It is a waste of your valuable time. I agree an empty box wouldn't have made me as angry as this. This is SO BAD it is my first ever posting of a review in over 25 years of programming.
4,I got a new game Jones,"Mr. Digger, while appearing fairly simple, is really a very addictive, enjoyable game. Mr. Digger is trying to dig his way down to the depths of the earth while avoiding blocks that keep falling on him. The twitch factor is very good and the strategy (mostly which block to drill) requires split second timing. While not really that original, it's a pretty fun game."
3,Soft and Mellow Sound,"This is a delightful album from the 'Finn Brothers', showcasing their mellow sound and luscious harmonies. The songs are rich and get better with every listen. There are no upbeat numbers here and it is more a soothing collection and best listened to solo. Standout tracks for me are 'Edible Flowers', 'Won't Give In' and 'Gentle Hum'. If you like Crowded House, you will love this. It is vintage 'Finn' sound, and not everyone's cup-of-tea, but the harmonies had me captivated."
3,There's always at least one killer tune on a Finn Brothers album,"Nothing on this one of the caliber of ""Only Talking Sense"" though. I bought it, played it a couple of times, but wasn't driven to play it to death. Lots of non-songs, that is, songs without unique and memorable melodies that set them apart from a gezillion other similar songs."
3,nature walks,Nature walks in orange county is a very good book. I liked the way the author gave listings of trails and what they include what to look for and hazards and even medical places to seek help if injured. i just find this book very interesting for the hiker in all of us.
2,A failed attempt to compare two historical periods,I felt rather disappointed reading this book. I seems to me that the author failed in giving a convincing picture. His comparisons of the Vietmam experience and classical or Homeric Greece are either superficial or forced. I suppose that the book may attract persons more involved in the Vietnam affair than I but I am convinced that this is caused by the Vietnam experience and not by the comparisons with classical Greece.
5,A Great Place to Start,"I'm new to classical music, and I was lucky enough to make this my first purchase. What a great place to start! As a jazz fan, the only thing I can relate it to is purchasing Miles Davis' Kind of Blue as your first jazz album. What emotion on this album. If you love music, you'll feel this album in your gut, heart and mind. It's wonderful."
5,"The best ""Emperor"" on disk","Van Cliburn is perfectly suited to play this work. He provides thunder when appropriate, and wistful poetry in the beautiful second movement. This work has been played by all of the great pianists, but Cliburn's interpretation leaves all of them far behind.The Rach. #2 is played with sensitivity; Cliburn's feel for this work is right on target. I cannot think of another performance as heart-felt as his."
5,"Brown Leather 5"" Stiletto Heeled Boots","The actual sizing runs a bit small for the tagged sizing. Otherwise, these boots are a good quality purchase."
5,it works!,"Works with 12 vdc, operating distance is about a little over 1/2"". You must follow the polarity of the arrows on both pieces, You can turn either piece 90 degree and will work. e.g, mounting one of the piece off 90 degree will work but not 180 degree. It's great for the opened-garage-door warning light, no more sticking your head out in the middle of the night."
3,Low voltage only!,"Make sure you need a low voltage switch or this is not the product for you. Will work to switch 110V with a relay and a little work! I ended up purchasing a larger white magnetic switch from an electronics distributor which had a stronger magnet in it and was a little larger and more suited to my application (which still required a relay!) I found no 110V magnetic switches available. I realize I can't really review this products reliability or proper functioning but wanted to put a 'buyer beware' notice for the reasons above. Also, the packaging mentions that this is an automotive device."
2,Switch 'sticks' when the current flows,"I am using this in a 12v DC application, and the switch sticks when the magnet is applied and then removed, presumably due to the current flow. It is running a small bilge pump, so the current must be too much. There are no amp ratings anywhere in the description or packaging, so it's up to your best guess if it will work for you. I took the unit apart to see if there was an obvious issue, but none was evident. The tolerances in the glass tube that houses the reed are incredibly tight, and there is hardly a difference in the open/closed positions. Sensitive little bugger."
3,"Works great, magnet could be a little stronger","The switching mechanism is fine. The screws were easy to turn and left enough room for wires to be put in. The inserts were clearly labeled. The problem is that without some careful planning the wires can rub together, shorting the circuit. This is due to the close proximity of the inserts but that allows it to be small. So, in this case the benefit of size outweighs the minor inconvenience. The triggering magnet could also be a little stronger but it worked well for my intentions."
2,Cheaply made,"These things have foam tape already attached in addition to having mounting holes. In my application I didn't need or want the tape, but when I removed it, it pulled the plastic case apart. I wasn't hard to glue it back together, but this clearly should not be necessary.They also require a pretty wide motion of the magnet to change state. I would not recommend using them in close quarters where a wide motion isn't possible."
2,Not worth the money,Have three year old twin granddaughters who love ALMOST anything animated...but not this. Watched maybe 2 minutes and have never asked to see it again. I'll be donating this to the next charity pick up.
5,My son goes nuts for this DVD!,The real world test for a DVD like this is whether it can capture your child's attention. This DVD works very well for our 20 month-old son and it is his second-favorite DVD of all time (next to Happy Feet!)An unexpected surprise is that we like it too! It has all your favorite nursery rhymes with a pop/rock edge to them that makes them just a little more listenable for the adults in the house/car while it is playing.It also has a good message about 911 and how to get help if a child has a serious accident.Overall a solid 5 star purchase for any parent looking for a good children's DVD.
5,This calendar is a must for busy families!,I found this calendar at Target last winter and bought it for myself. I love it so much I'm probably going to buy a bunch to give as Christmas gifts this year!
2,Rarely reaching up,"2 1/2There are a few inspired tracks whose uplifting programming effectively seeps into the skin, but too much shallow songwriting repeats and reiterates itself as sub-Stereolab endeavor."
1,Nothing executive about this workout,"I bought this dvd because I was looking for a workout that I could do in my hotel room while on business trips. The problem I encountered is that bands and weights are used in many exercises, making the whole workout irreleveant unless you have those elements with you. Now, if somewhere in the cover, or at the beginning of the workout, it was explicited that you will require other elements, it would be different. But the whole idea of this dvd was that you were able to do it in your hotel room, so why not using elements that are likely to be there (towels, bed, sidebed table... )? Besides, who wants to carry weights in his-her suitcase? There's no reference to the ""executive"" side of the workout, except for some blurry shots that separate one section from the other, showing individuals in some sort of corporate presentation... Big disappointment."
4,great sack,Sleep sacks are the best invention ever. The only reason it lost a star is because the zipper gets caught in the lining too easily. I would recommend a sleep sack to everyone with a baby. My son went right from the miracle blanket swaddler into the sack and he sleeps 12-13 hrs per night.
5,A VERY COOL ALBUM,This album is filled with the smooth harmonies and pop sounds that characterize Os Mutantes. It is a great introduction for Anglos into the world of this great Brazilian band. The translation into English of the lyrics allow those that do not speak Portuguese to appreciate all the songs fully.
2,Mutating Into English,"Os Mutantes are incontrovertibly hip. They were the first band picked by Luaka Bop (David Byrne's world music label) for the World Psychedelic Classics series, never mind that they haven't been a group in decades. And they are the reason Beck called his most sophisticated album ""Mutations."" This is a band you must hear.Tecnicolor, however, is not the place to start, and not even much of a place to continue if you're already a fan. The songs are English-version rehashes of their Portuguese classics, toned down so that they are less interesting, and badly translated so that they are just plain silly.If you want everything the Mutants ever produced, this is a required part of the collection. Otherwise, get one of the other records. Because those are brilliant."
1,Not So Good,"Tried using this product in a ""Havahart"" trap. Just did not work for me. I have used regular peanuts and various other baits in the past with pretty good results and tried this product looking possibly for even better results. I am now back to using peanuts in a shell."
1,Not Effective,"I got better results with peanuts and/or a small jar of peanut butter. Also, I was turned off by the name ""Revenge"". I'm looking for a product to help me humanely trap a squirrel who's taken up shop above the garage and needs relocating. I'm not some knuckle-dragging neanderthal who needs to take 'revenge' on a critter 1/100th my size."
2,Not a great follow up,"my daughter loved marsupial sue, but did not like this story at all and neither did I. Marsupial Sue is not even the central character in this story."
2,so dissapointed this was not an original marsupial sue story,"rather, a total rip-off of the old gingerbread man tale. If this had been free, I guess I wouldn't care. But for $13.00, I expected more from Lithgow. My daughter (and I) loved his other, original stories (I'm a Manatee; Marsupial Sue) so I expected great things. I feel badly writing this in the face of 10 reviews with 5 stars, but we were incredibly dissapointed that marsupial sue was not even in this story, other than I guess she's playing the Auntie character. The CD is great, so I'll give it 2 stars since I feel like I paid $13.00 for a few minutes of listening fun in the car. My daughter looks at the book while Lithgow tells the story in his always terrific style."
1,Not the right thing,"I bought this thinking that it was Beckett's annual baseball card price guide that lists and prices every card ever made. I have bought such price guides in the past, so there was nothing to lead me to think otherwise. However, when I finally received it and started looking up prices, I was stunned to find a lack of listings. There are no insert cards listed, period. Also, there are only select sets listed as well. Needless to say I was very displeased with this book. I have since looked on Beckett's own web site and found that there is such a 2005 edition of their price guide. It is, however, listed as #27. What is the deal here? Is Beckett purposely running two editions concurrently to confuse people like me?"
2,Not enough entries,"I have a very large baseball card collection, and am using the book to rate the cards. So far, after going through several hundered cards, I have had a very difficult time finding many of the cards listed in the book. It is very frustrating. I expected more from Beckett."
5,...fascinating...,"First of all, because I am of the age group that this book was intended for, I feel that my review should be read carefully, and with an open mind. I found the book, ""Others See Us"", to be quite fascinating. The plot was well written, and it captured my attention throughout the book. As a result, it was very thought-provoking. I would highly reccomend it as an exciting adventure into the world of science fiction."
2,Kind of flat,"I dont see why this book has such high reviews. I like Sleator normally, but this book lacking something that the other books Ive read by him dont; Marco's Millions, the Last Universe etc. A broader plot for one. And characters that I kind of care about. I find it hard to have empathy for these incest minded charaters. The only thing I got from the book is a strong desire to want to read minds!!!!"
3,"""Addictive""","I'm a non-reader. I don't really read because I'm to lazy, but i enjoy reading sometimes. "" Others See Us"" is one of the few books I enjoyed reading. It not only has a twist in the end, but it also leaves you thinking about everything that happens in the story. Sometimes in the book, you ask your self questions which you have no answer to. What kept me asking my self was if there are actually people who have special abilities to read mines, and if so, who? I never know if a person close to me can read mines, and because of that, I can't beaware of when I should hide or can feel my personal part of the mine or build walls in my head to protect my mine from others. This book is a mysterous and intresting one. You can't put it down once you start reading it."
3,there's a lot of incest in this book,"i mean there is a LOT of incest in this book.the psychic battles were cool and for a mid-to-late-90s young-adult novel it holds attention, but yeah. incest-o-rama."
4,Others See Us,"I thought this was a great book! It had a lot of detail without getting boring. Also it was intresting and went to topicsslower than some books. This made it easy to follow and not to confusing. The characters were very developed, so it was easy to relate to them. Somthing I didn't like about the book was that it didn't completly explain everything. It left me hanging. Even at the end it left things unanswered. Especially things about grandma. I really enjoyed the ending it was a big twist. I think the moral of the story was you cant judge a book by its cover, but in this story it was backward. I also loved all of the cliffhangers. So if you love suspense this is the book for you."
3,"Good, but not great","This book, like other William Sleator books, had a great concept, but this one falls short of his others. When I read this book, I didn't get into it the way I got into his others - I didn't find it particularly compelling. I think it might have been charcter development that I found to be lacking. However, I think this book is worth reading for young adults because it is intelligent and it gives young people something to think about. Like other Sleator books, I find myself thinking about different aspects of the book, even years after reading it."
4,Excellent Sci-Fi Adventures for Dr. Who Fans,"I was wondering how David Tennant would do without his regular companions, in the David Tennant specials, but he is such a great actor with great story lines, so it was again a pleasure to watch the shows."
5,Love it!,A pleasure to watch! As always Dr. Who did not disappoint. I've been looking for this episode and it was definately a can't miss special!
4,Allons-y!,"These are brilliant episodes. These specials blow any other television show out of the water. Even though Matt Smith is my favorite Doctor, David Tennant will always be one of my favorites. The Waters Of Mars is a great special, and the new characters are so complex and interesting. These specials get you thinking, they stimulate your mind. I love it. Wonderful. The only problem I have with it is that they weren't available for free streaming for a long time."
4,Time Lords and Cacti and David Tennant. Oh My!,"Wonderful, inspiring, poignant, and sweet are a few words that come to mind when describing this two-part episode. Tennant's portrayal of the Doctor is always spot-on and his supporting cast members are wonderful as well. The story is true to the spirit and verse of Doctor Who and leads us gently to an inevitable end that no one wants."
2,So disappointed...,"I love the Dr. Who series. Unfortunately, this special is really bad. It's way beyond the ""little bit cheesy"" that I expected; it's simply too ridiculous to enjoy. Poor direction, poor storytelling, and an overall disappointment."
2,The end of an awful era of Doctor Who...,"The words cannot be found to express how joyful it was to see the Russel T Davis / David Tennant era of Doctor Who come to an end. From the endless whining to the on going ""I'm Sorry I'm So Sorry"" to a string of awful companions not to mention the idiocy of the 10th Doctor blubbering about 'not wanting to move on'... well what can I say, there's a reason why Matt Smith was praised as perhaps the best Doctor ever after 3 series of pure tripe."
5,I couldn't watch Planet of the Dead on Netflix so I bought it here,It was a pretty cool episode and honestly pretty important to the 3 episodes that come after it. Titty Sprinkes
3,Skip-able,"We bought this on Amazon Instant because we had gotten hooked on the Doctor Who series on Netflix and were watching each episode in order... However Netflix didn't have ""Planet of the Dead"", so Amazon Instant came to the rescue. The video quality was great and all, but the episode itself was just okay, and if you're like us and are newly hooked Doctor Who fans, and want to watch the whole series, this particular episode is not integral to the overall Doctor Who plot, doesn't have any past beloved characters, and is overall ""skip-able"" if you don't want to shell out the $3 for it on Amazon Instant. Not saying it was a waste of time, just not fantastic."
5,A Brilliant End to Tennant's Tenure.,"I laughed with the Doctor, I cried with the Doctor, I lived the series through the Doctor. Truely, his final two episodes were the highest point of the series thus far. No actor has made me care for a series quite like David Tennant. His acting was high tier through and through, and his occasionnal witty and snarky remarks always made me roll on the floor laughing.My only complaint is that Tennant had to end his role in the series here. I hope to see him again."
3,Not bad...,"This was a short but good book. At times I got bogged down with the ""darkness"" in the book but overall it was okay."
2,Poor as a documentary,"A guy with a camera goes from place to place getting quotes from people about divinity and religion. There are some translations into English. There are images of thought provoking faces, interesting rituals and eye catching vistas.There are a lot of comments about ""maybe this"" and ""maybe that"". There are also numerous declarations about what is the absolute truth.Excluding the appeal to emotion, this is a documentary that doesn't do as good a job in 98 minutes as a Wikipedia article I would spend 30 minutes reading."
3,not my favorite,I thought this DVD had been too hyped up. I was disappointed and returned for refund.
3,Where was the third disc,"There was no third disc, that fraud, as far as I am concern. I have to say I am tired of nuns."
1,Not as Advertised,"I just received this product today and have not viewed the videos so i am not commenting on them per se. But there are only 2 dvds in this set, not 3 as advertised. The dvd ""The History of Nunsploitation"" is not in this set."
1,detesto esta clase de literatura,"estos libros, que no se sabe lo que son, si son novelas, o libritos de autoayuda realmente me dan nauseas, son como las novelitas rosas escritas para niñas para leer entre quehaceres domesticos. es un pseudogenero sin ningun valor. volar y no tener limites nos dice el autor no estoy de acuerdo con que la gente joven lea esta clase de cosas, realmente pueden llegar a creer que en la vida todo es asi prefiero para los jovenes algo mas real mas palpable, sin tener necesariamente que ser crudo.. LUIS MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do"
5,Loved it!,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Thee were many laugh out loud moments. Totally worth the rental price. I highly recommend it.It was great sering Chris Rock in such a subdued role.
3,Meh,Some funny moments but a step down from other Chris Rock movies. I would pass on this one if you have something else to watch.
1,Bad,This is movie is so pointless. Not sure what is about.This is an awful to write about. Do not bother with this movie.
3,2 Days in New York,"It's was an okay movie not as fun as I expected and if the recommend but not as Best Picture,"
1,Awful.,"Pay-per-viewed this movie at home. Or, I should say, started to. Shut it off after about 30 minutes. This is one of the more unfunny scripts & deliveries I've seen. Rented it based on a positive review from Roger Ebert, who I generally trust.We disagree on this one.Chris Rock & Julie Delpy are a couple who share an apartment and children, and who are visited by Delpy's cliched, boring ""goofy"" family members. A trite plot with no jokes.Rent/view at your own risk."
1,Painful,Really painful and long. We speak French and English and it actually made it worst as we could understand the whole story which made even more boring.
1,Very Bad Movie,"Julie Delphy wrote, directed, produced and starred in this movie. Sometimes multiple roles works and sometimes they do not. In this case, we have a major failure.Watching this movie made me tired. I don't know if was the subtitles or the bad script and acting. There is an occasional bit of humor that is all too rare. Mostly it just seems a movie of discord and bickering.The only good thing I have to say about this flick is that it is now over as I turned it off. It was too bad to finish."
3,quirky,"was a bit disappointed not as funny as i expected from Chris Rock but enjoyable, would recommend it to friends"
4,Fantastic!,Julie Delpy and Chris Rock make a funny couple in this movie. Great to see Chris Rock in a role like this. I enjoyed the sister.Adult siblings still fighting in public like kids.
2,Chris in this nonsense... Well I know he's a comedian...,"Chris in this nonsense... Well I know he's a comedian... but where was the comedy? I bought this because I love Chris Rock in ANYTHING! Sorry, just not in this nonsense... I had to spend too much time reading caption than watching the movie... but that is not the tough part - it is just boring! So I did not see it to the end..."
4,bizarre yet funny,"We liked this movie, it was nice for Thanksgiving, as it was about bizarre relatives that come to stay and make Chris Rock's character more annoyed by the minute."
1,Just Sad,"This movie is wrong on almost every level. Chris Rock who is a comedic genius, should have taken off after the first day of filming. This Woody Allen wanna-be, uses potty humor, incessant French chatter (sub-titled) and scads of desperately contrived plots thrown together in the hopes that these inane plots might seem artsy. The result is an embarrassingly bad film.The writing and directing honestly seem more akin to a bad high school play. I can't believe I bought the thing. The DVD went right into the trash. I wouldn't waste anyone's time trying to recycle the film. It is that bad."
1,Stupid and boring,Don't waste your money on this movie. This is a really stupid script with bad acting and vulgar language. I kept watching in the hope it would get better. Unfortunately it kept getting worse.
2,I couldn't make it through,"Very disappointing. I finally had to turn it off after more than halfway in. Between the unnecessary subtitles and no plot, it was horrible."
2,"""2 Days in New York""","I found it boring, and not very funny. Just plain tedious, with only a few amusing scenes. Some of my friends did like this movie."
2,It's too chatty with no direction,"I think this film attempts to be funny, but honestly it's just a lot of chatter with no real direction. The humour isn't there."
2,Boring,"The movie was the girlfriend's choice so I really TOFTT. Julie Delpy is usually fantastic but her talents were not put to good use. I believe she either directed or wrote the screenplay but either way, missed the mark. Chris Rock was surprisingly unentertaining in this. They theoretically could have used anyone to fill that role."
3,Okay,"Funny, but not as much as the trailer led us to believe. Delpy has a distinct style, but this was no Before Sunrise or Before Sunset."
4,Good value,"I like that this keyboard plays louder if you hit the keys harder and softer when you touch the keys.There are a lot of programs on here so you can learn to play new songs, record etc.This is a good price for what you get. I searched for the better part of a year and this is the keyboard that had the best price and options for me."
4,Not just for fans (?),"South Park is a killer show, but lets face it Chef's Luv Shack left MUCH to be desired from the average fan of the show and casual gamer. South Park Rally is hilarious, cute, and rude at the same time. The graphics are, well South Park-ish, but Cartman and friendz get to pop out of their 2D worlds and actually have *gasp* graphic depth. There are plenty of races to choose from, and some of them are even challenging...but this game (like Luv Shack) is best in multiplayer mode. It's sic fun throwing salty balls at your friends and [vomiting] on them as they try to pass you. The load time is pretty annoying, waiting for each race to load, but each track is worth the wait. There are plenty of characters to choose from, and an exclusive Dreamcast track (the graphics are also tweaked and much better than the Playstation version)...I have yet to get bored with this game. If you're not a fan, I'd recommend renting it first...but I think you'll love it."
4,Best racing game!,"I have been playing more traditional racing games. This is the first of this kind that I played. It was really fun. Unlike other racing games, you can do dirty tricks to win! The graphic is OK. It's South Park. What do you expect? The courses are a bit challenging at advanced levels, but it still is very enjoyable. The only things that I didn't like was the loading time. I had to wait about 10 seconds for the game to load every time I do a new race. The beginning sequence always shows the logos and the usual South Park song which cannot be turned off, so you have to spend at least 20 seconds looking at those things everytime you turn on the machine. But I think it is worth the wait."
5,Exactly what a flash card should be,"These cards are meant to be carried everywhere -- they are sturdy business-card size. Waiting for the bus, in the departure lounge in the airport, with some dead moments before a lecture... perfect moments to pull out the cards. I especially like the stroke order -- I can trace them with my finger on the large character, even if I don't have a pencil or exercise book. Others have commented on the sample sentences and compounds. The publisher explains that these are to illustrate some of the range of meanings , they are no substitute for a text, dictionary or grammar! A flash card is for review, not for primary learning, and should be judged as such. The order of characters presented is also logical: groups of related characters (e.g. I, you, him/her/it) and in increasing order of complexity.Finally, my native speaker (PRC) tutors love these cards and the clever sentences and interesting sayings included ""for fun""."
2,Wish I hadn't bought them...,"These cards are well made, no problem there, and the design of the cards are great. The problem is that each character is printed separately on its own card, whereas a high percentage of Chinese vocabulary are made of of two characters; for example, ""garden"" is hua-yuan, but, there's a character card for hua and another card for yuan. It would be like English cards that had a card for base and another card for ball, but, no card for baseball as one word, or for sweet potato or for study hall. The cards would work well for learning to recognize distinct, separate characters, but not for practical vocabulary practice : you may not mind this, and I wouldn't have imagined it to be a problem, either, but, for what it's worth, I no longer use the cards (instead,I have made my own so I have all of those two-character words on one card...)."
2,Not for absolute beginners,"The flashcards are fine, but I would recommend them only as supplementary material once you are acquainted with some of the principles of character formation (there are several fine books for this), like character roots, and the more you know about this, the easier it will be to remember the characters. The booklet that comes with the flashcards is only a very shallow introduction to this. I think that, if I had begun to study characters with these flashcards, I would have been completely overwhelmed. (By the way, if you are an absolute beginner and still have not acquired basic pronunciation skills, I would reccomend not starting to learn characters right away, but instead trying to get some speech proficiency first, using Pimsleur for example)"
1,IS THIS A JOKE?,"I cannot recall the last time I heard or read ""Jinri Yangguang Puzhao"" (simple sentence). Maybe in elementary school? yeah? maybe in 1980's text books? Nobody says, or writes ""jinri yangguang puzhao"". Except mintally ill people who has lived through culture evolution. or, when you are joking.Come on, go find another book."
2,Not what I expected,Too many little cards which is quite painful to sort out and look for words you need. I would not recommend it.
2,"Great idea, poor execution","Perhaps it's a question of trying to put too much information out, but the cards are very difficult to read due to small font size."
5,Great Flash Cards,"Tuttle's ""Chinese in a Flash"" cards are superb. As shown in the sample photographs, the cards include both traditional and simplified characters, stroke order, and sample phrases which demonstrate usage. The photos speak for themselves.It would have been nice if a small card-sized box were included for portability. Thankfully, the flash cards are not too much smaller than gaming cards (e.g. Magic cards), so something like the Ultra-Pro ""Deck Box"" is a decent fit (for roughly a third of the cards in the set)."
5,Great for beginners.,"I am learning Chinese & these flashcards are great! They are a very nice size to carry around, plus they have several different words listed at the bottom of the card that also use the character. They show the simplified & original character. The biggest plus for me is they show you the order in which to write the character (they only show order on the simplified character)! I would highly recommend these cards if you are learning Mandarin Chinese."
5,Lively and insiteful writing,This collection of poems covers a lot of ground. Worth twice the cover price just for the poem about Chuck Berry.
5,Meat Wisdom: Chew on this,"In a world where form is scorned as a tool of yesterday, which stifles so-called freedom of true expression, this slim but substantial book of sonnets proves everyone wrong.Sex. Drugs. Rock and Roll. The natural world outside your kitchen window. It's all represented here.The stuff of life.Music is the key. Whether it be a bird's song (""Blackbirds at Dawn""), or the innermost pain of the genius (""John Lennon""), music and its rhythms pervade every poem.If songs be written, then write them from these poems."
2,"Editing error in Variations for Piano, op. 27","Track 18, the first movement of the Variations for Piano, op. 27, has an editing mistake. The four-beat phrase at measure 39 to m. 40/beat 1 in the score (1:11-1:13 in track 18) repeats literally at 1:14-1:16 in the recording. This repetition does not occur in the score, where m. 40/beat 3 through m. 41 are the retrograde of mm. 39 to m. 40, beat 1.For those interested in the Symphony, op. 21, I recommend the CD reissue of Herbert von Karajan's 1974 recording with the Berlin Philharmonic on DGG."
3,The one Burroughs book to buy,"The one book by William S. Burroughs you should buy. The unique genius that William truly was-yes, indulgent, odd and unsettling at 80, but how great it would have been to have known him young and probably pretty in 1950-is best understood with the direction of J. Grauerholz, although a bourgeois beatnik, for sure, who did love him and is the world expert on him. Ira Silverberg is a true young publishing genius, the new Ferlinghetti, and most responsible for the book. My earlier review I withdraw. Although true, it did not reflect the genius and truth of William-and Jack, Allen, Anne, Philip, Lawrence, Gregory, Gary, even Neal and Huncke, et al. View their literature with a full and clear understanding of their weaknesses and that we, the readers, are almost certain to have less ability to `drive-on' pass the drugs, sex, parties, confusion-to produce as they could or can. At least be warned. A lot of souls have been lost on the beat road."
1,The Man in the Iron Mask (1939) VHS -- Colorized!,"Beware! This is a wonderful film, not yet available on DVD, but at least one of the VHS versions being sold has been colorized--which is a hideous and disrespectful thing to do to a great old black and white film. It would be helpful if Amazon could include this information on its sale pages. Since they don't, before buying a VHS, if getting the original B&W matters to you (and I hope it does), then inquire carefully of your seller. I got a VHS from Video Treasures, it was colorized, and I returned it."
1,Man in the Iron Mask w/Louis Hayward,I did not receive this VHS tape.I have been pretty patient but now I'd like to know why I have not.Cheryl Gump
5,Only Game in Town,"The movie gets five stars, while the ""Movieology"" dvd version gets between three and four stars. The bottom line with ""The Man in the Iron Mask (1939)"" is that this version is the only dvd available. I saw this movie a few times on tv in my youth and absolutely loved it. Several years ago, I was finally able to obtain a pricey VHS copy, and now, thanks to Firecake Entertainment, I can enjoy the movie in dvd format. Yes, I certainly wish somebody will eventually restore it and that the quality of the print would be much better, but until that time, this dvd is the only game in town and it was offered at a very reasonable price. As for the movie, it is Louis Hayward at his best, with Joseph Schildkraut stealing the movie."
2,Unmasked Iron Mask,"Unfortunatley this DVD is a major disapointment.This is a wonderfull movie classic but there has been no digital re mastering,and what we have here is a dub of an average quality film print,or possibly video print, onto the DVD. Why bother,unless you are going to enhance the already available video. Sorry chaps,not this time .Garry Stewart- Melbourne ,Australia."
5,Great scanner for a great price,"I recently purchased a scanner to scan in my old 35mm slides but found that something was wrong with the scanner and/or driver. So, after doing some research (and returning the other scanner)and since I've wanted to replace my old scanner, I decided upon the Epson Perfection. To my surprise, the installation was easy, the pictures looked great and the slides were almost perfect! For only $70 more, I got a full scanner that scanned my slides and film strips as well."
2,not 10.3 friendly,scanner is just barely compatible with panther. Useless software. All the updates available won't make it run on Epson software. Be prepared. Only scans to Photoshop. Many hours spent setting up. Three calls to Epson. At one point I was told I didn't have enough memory and I have 1.25 Gigs! Stupid scanner - real hog. Dissappointed. Gonna try the PS solution - let you all know.
3,Black spots under the glass,"I loved the scanner as of the moment it came out of the box. Great quality scans and friendly software. Unfortunately, when I started scanning pictures with a great deal of light colours, I noticed black dots in the same place on all scans. It turned out these lint-like spots that were under the glass and could not be cleaned. Also the glass had some scratches. I see one more review with the same problem. Please inspect your scanner upon purchase. If I had realized this a few days later, I would not have been able to get my money back. I am thinking of getting another Epson scanner, but now I am not sure of the quality and dedication Epson puts into their scanners."
3,Does not support USB 2.0 in Macintosh,"Expected it to work with USB 2.0, so ordered USB 2.0 PCI card when I ordered the Scanner. When the scanner was delivered and tried out, I found it did not support USB 2.0 on the Mac...It states this on the box, but nowhere did I see that it was not supported when I ordered it.Also, much of the software does not work with Panther(OS10.3.5). I finally found it could be used by ignoring the buttons on the scanner front. Turning the power on the scanner and waiting for the light to glow steady, then launching the Epson Scan application by double clicking allowed me to scan.The scanned results were very nice and I scanned a bunch of old 35mm slides with excellent results. I hope Epson upgrades its software to make all of this scanner's features work with Panther."
3,Software can really confuse you,"Most of the time all works well if you operate in ""full auto"" mode. It does get confusing at times because the software that comes with the scanner constantly opens and closes windows, sometimes with a long delay in between. The scanner has big trouble with washed out pictures. Then things can get really confusing!"
1,Terrible Product for Mac,"I had an old Epson scanner - it was perfect - easy to use, great quality scans, I loved it ( I gave it to my son). This new 3170 is awful. The software is buggy and severly limits the types of files you can save. On top of all this, Amazon took 3 weeks to send it even though the site said it would ship in 2-3 business days.Save your money for something that works well, this is not it."
3,Insufficient Information For Scanning negatives,"I purchased this scanner , and got it delivered to me yesterday. As far as the photo scanning is concerned, I think this is ok. But what concerns me is that, even after I connect the film adapter cable, and use the home mode/professional mode, the scnner is not able to scan negatives. I use the negatives adapter unit for this. Everytime I scan, the home mode does not show color film/transperancy/negatives as a document type option. I also removed the scanner cover while trying to scan negatives, but no change! Did anyone else have the same problem? If you can suggest something for this, I guess Illtry it out and keep the product, else Im planning to return this. Because I purchased this product to mainly scan all my negatives!!!Thanks"
2,3170 problems,"My new Epson 3170 scanner works intermittently. I purchased the scanner primarily to scan 35mm slides. In that mode, when I insert four slides into the adapter, I do a preview, and all slides show perfectly. When i click on ""SCAN"" sometimes I get four good scans, sometimes I don't. On one occasion, with a perfect preview, the scan indicated five slides, and gave me one good slide and four portions of the other three. When it works properly the quality is excellent. I have had no problems with scanning prints."
4,"Very nice scanner, Very poor software.","I'm kind of having mixed emotions about this one. While it produces some of very decent quality scans , the software that claims to be the help (as the copy function or scan and mail) in fact is the nail in the chair padding. It takes time to realize that without this bunch of garbage that Epson has packed with the default installation we will do much better.The scanner by itself is very versatile,it is reasonably quick and has very good color rendition. It accepts MF film that makes many things for the inspired photographer much simpler. I'm not sure does it posses as much of the physical resolution as it claims to be, but I will describe it of as decent and reliable. It takes your works into much more expensive level that was out of reach (by monetary meanings) for most of us only couple years ago.I would give it 3.5 stars. 5 stars for hardware for the price range, and 0 stars for shamefull software."
3,Software stinks!,"Having never owned a scanner I'm am quite impressed with the quick and beautiful job this thing does of putting my old photos into the computer. But the bundled software really leaves alot to be desired. A really elegant piece of software is usually immediatly comfortable and intuitive. Epson's ""Smart Panel"" software leaves me cursing and gritting my teeth. I've figured out pretty much how to quickly do whatever I want (except right now I cannot even figure out how to quickly change my default save folder), but after using this program I almost feel dirty. It is that sloppy. It's too bad. I guess I never thought about what scanner software would entail. I just figured it would be something simple, something like 'select your resolution/settings, choose your destination, scan.' It's amazing how convoluted the programmers made the interface."
5,Always download driver from the WEB SITE! (apple G5),"I purchased a microtek at the same resolution capacity and it was AWFUL!!! Software crashed and it wouldn't work on my apple g5 running 10.3.1 OR windows XP. So, I tried this one for 50 dollars more and it's fabulous. I would think by now people would learn that when you buy something that didn't just come out yesterday, ALWAYS go to the web site for the most recent driver(s)! It has updated patches and drivers for mac os 10.3 and I've had no problems whatsoever. This is the 3rd scanner I've tried to scan slides on and this one is by far the best quality. Who cares about speed ? Quality is there - you're not going to get a rocket for $199. It is the most convenient, regarding use with slides - no outside attachment and you can do 4 at a time."
1,The Worst Scanner on the Planet,I have found overall the Epson might possibly have the worst products. I am in the computer programming business and have had the opportunity to work with several different models. I recently purchased the 1670 which I returned to the store within 24hours - the software was so unintuitive and the scanning was pathetically slow. I then tried the 1370 thinking if I spent more money I would get a better product -WRONG. The software crashed so many times on my computer (Mac OS X 10.3) that I also returned it 24hours later. I haven't found a scanner that I love yet - so good luck with your search.
3,I enjoy studying with it,I am using it this semester a I really have learned a lot. It explains things very well. I was not able to read English because I am from soutamerica but now because of this book I can.
1,What???,"When I unpackaged this pump I was surprised to learn that the lower part of the housing comprising the inlet filter is not attached to the main body of the pump. The filter unit has a loose slip fit, and it just slips right off. There is no way that the filter will stay attached to the unit, and hence the unit will fail as there is no viable inlet filter. I keep looking to see if a screw is missing or something, but it appears it is designed this way. It looks very different than what it does in the picture, and I am confused if the pump was really designed this way, or if I was just sent a random collection of pump parts.This is the second MAJOR disappointment I have received from Little Giant pumps, and I assure you I will NEVER purchase another product from them. This was a waste of $90."
2,Can't really recommend it.,"Although side 1 has some useful information, I found the ""self-hypnosis"" portion on side 2 to be rather irritating. The recording is hallow sounding, and the music got on my nerves. I guess it comes down to personal taste, but I can't rate this very highly."
5,"Dark, moody and ohh so good.","I heard this band when they supported System Of a Down in Sydney in 2001, and I was in awe of them. The laziest comparisons are drawn between these guys and Tool,because they both play expansive and melodic metalic rock. To limit these guys to being Tool knock offs is downright wrong. Flynn Gower has an almost angelic voice, though capable of raging when the mood requires it, his guitar playing underplayed and subtle. The real star of the show, live especially, is drummer Lucious. Never retaining a straight beat, this guy is amazing, effotlessly pounding out flurry after flurry on his kit, though a little lost on the E.P. due to the fact it was recorded on a 4 track. Despite that fact, the sound is very clear.If you like Tool, and other driving metalic bands like Dreadnaught, Karnivool and their ilk, check this band out. One of the finest bands Australia has ever produced."
4,Thought provoking,"It paints a spiritual picture of a number of characters in Dan'l Quorm's life that 1) allows you to see into the persono of each character; 2) relate to the almost proverb-type thoughts in very human ways; and 3) see the humanity in relationships within a fellowship group. Perhaps best, it is thought-provoking, and although not written for the purpose, could serve as a small group study text, using the thoughts of the characters as study/discussion material, or chapter-by-chapter discussion. The insights are very appealing; the writing style is perhaps too ""Old English"" traditional. Overall, an excellent little book."
3,didn't work for us (:,didn't work for us (: it might not be the product as our cat has a blind eye but it might work for other things/problems just was not right product for our cat
2,"""Eldorado"" shimmers, but the rest is weak.","""Eldorado"" as done by Fleming and John (who?) is amazing and wonderful....the singer just absolutely makes the song her own.The rest of the album is pretty marginal....every song other than the aforementioned ""Eldorado"" suffers from either amateurish performance or miles-off-the-mark reinterpretation (i.e, Todd Rundgren's drum-and-bass ""Bluebird is Dead"": I know the idea seems cool, but- trust me, you *don't* want to pay to hear it.)Oh well."
4,"Interesting Project, Varying Quality","The inestimable Doug Powell put together a disparate group of artists to cover songs of Jeff Lynne, all the way from The Move to ELO to solo to The Traveling Wilberries.Although the songs are all superior, some covers are much better than others. I particularly enjoyed Jamie Hoover's cover of ""Handle With Care,"" as well as Todd Rundgren's beautiful take on ""Bluebird."" Solid contributions also by Swag, Bill Lloyd, Earl Slick, and Jason Falkner.I might have spliced this down to a single disc, and gotten rid of some of the covers that don't add much. But on balance this is a nice tribute to a great artist."
2,This book is done right horrible,"A version of Lex Luther is trying to find the perfect Earth while Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman deal with some problems they created (namely the spy satelite that Batman created and the murder comitted by Wonder Woman on international television).I found this book to be very confusing. It jumped around too much and had way too many characters in it. It looks like every DC character ever created has a major role in this book. The reader does not get a good feel for what is going on with many of the characters. The character development is lousy. I've enjoyed most of the other Batman related books that I have read even the ones that brought in DC characters that I wasn't overly familiar with, but this one, no, it just didn't work for me because I don't feel like I've gotten to know any of the characters that well. In the end I didn't much care for any of them, even Batman. For someone not familiar with the DC Comics, this is a terrible book to read for that."
4,Super cute,This book is lots of fun. Twenty-six pages of pictures of professions starting with each letter of the alphabet. Then there are other various items on each page all starting with the same letter. The book is as advertised and we had fun reading. Although pointing to/naming every item on 26 pages can take awhile!
3,"Great concept, poorly edited","As part of our daughter's first birthday present, we purchased this book from Amazon. The concept for the book is wonderful; it reinforces the letters of the alphabet while introducing new readers to a panoply of exciting occupations. We particularly like that the examples span from traditional gender roles (e.g. ballerina) to traditionally male-dominated occupations (e.g. zoologist). Unfortunately, the book was not copy-edited well prior to production. The pages for the letters C and D are missing, and the font used throughout the book is very small and is neither terribly attractive nor engaging for a toddler. For the price, I suppose the positives of the book outweigh the negatives, but the workmanship could have been much better."
1,LIVE concert .. not original recordings,Anyone expecting the original versions of the Classic Johnny Cash tunes listed on this album will be disappointed. This is a recording of an unknown Live concert. The sound quality is fine... but only the true Cash Collector interested in something unusual should invest in this pile.
2,Don't believe the 5-star reviews,"This book is terrible. The writing is exceedingly poor, perhaps matched in sub-par quality by the editing. I am a sucker for a zombie novel, but this one really isn't worth the price at all.The main character is at the best of times completely wooden and unbelievable as a human being and at the worst of times a sort of talking prop. The author obsesses over extremely minor things in a vain (in both sense of the word) attempt to show his familiarity with weapons.At best this is a poorly edited zombie novel, but even its best isn't good enought to make it worth spending money on."
3,It's OK,"I like zombie movies. Sadly, I have yet to read a great zombie book.This one is alright, and avoids many of the cliches I expected, but it isn't anything to write home about.It doesn't pack any punch, visceral, emotional, or otherwise.It isn't bad and it isn't great. It is OK."
3,"Horrible editing, good storyline","Good story - not all that original, but worth the read. I've read reviews from other books by the same publisher that had the same editing complaint. There are tons of grammar issues throughout this book. At first I thought it might be part of the aesthetics of the novel, but the grammar issues really have no rhyme or reason.This publishing company needs to do its authors' justice and edit these novels professionally."
1,Weak writing and story,"Echoing other comments in the crowd that did not enjoy this book - the writing style was not only amateurish, it came off as extremely juvenile as well. The spelling and grammatical errors don't work when the 'journal' was typed out neatly as opposed to being at least a handwriting font. The storyline was sub par to begin with, but the weak writing and editing really killed this.This book was a big disappointment based on the 4.5 star reviews."
1,Disappointing to say the least,"If you up for extremely unrealistic zombie fiction that is full of grammatical errors, this is the book for you. If, however, you're looking for a well-written and more realistic book for your reading enjoyment, look elsewhere. As I said in my review of this book's sequel, I realize that zombie fiction is fantasy, but some authors make the experience as realistic as they can, which adds to the enjoyment. But when the main character is a military officer who is already prepared for the apocalypse and is the luckiest person in the world, it just gets plain boring. Canned characters are aplenty in this novel. The dialog is corny. The novelty of the ""journal"" style of writing wears off quickly.There are plenty of zombie novels out there. Pick any other. Nothing can get worse."
1,Save your money,"Save your money and buy a different book. I purchased this book based on the reviews and that was an enormous mistake. Obviously, there are multitudes of individuals that have no standards on the quality of writing they read. Bourne's writing is simplistic, boring, and trite. If that is your style, by all means, buy this book."
2,"amateur, could have been written by a high school kid","Just so you know, the main character prefers FOX news and uses the word ""liberal"" pejoratively. The main character is also completely without personality, background, hobbies, and significant friends beyond the military. Go figure.If you're a serious zombie apocalypse fan, this might be worth checking out at a USED price, but be warned. This is no World War Z caliber story telling."
3,A Daily Log of Death...,"My wife and I found Mr. Bourne's debut novel - Day by Day Armageddon - to be a pretty sleek and cool read. But we found there wasn't enough building characterization for us.Although somewhat unique in execution of the typical zombie novel, the main character's first kills seemed glossed over, not showing how he felt about taking a life, or an undead life. Just did it. Even a true blooded soldier fresh from combat would feel something.But alas, it was not found nor explored here. It made the realism and the horror shock value of the story deadened for the reader. (Pun intended.)But overall, for a first time novel, Bourne writes pretty well and fast-paced. Although he needs an editor. We spotted tons of misspelled words and usage of 'to' instead of the proper 'too'.But we love action/adventure/horror novels. And although not as well written as Brian Keene's The Rising, it was still a breezy, nice read."
1,Outdated,If you are like me and consider slow moving zombies not only outdated and boring then do not read this book. How does anyone not get away from anything that moves .5 mph? Seriously.
4,Zombielicious,"I am a huge fan of Zombie fiction and was not disappointed by this novel. However I am biased and I do agree with other reviewers that sticking to the traditional Romero zombie makes a better novel. I have read novels where zombies drive and talk, to me that completely belongs in another genre. This novel is written in journal format and although there a few typos here and there they might be stylistic. It has a fair amount of action and although many reviewers have complained that the protagonist is over prepared, well if he wasn't there really wouldn't be a survival journal would there? I don't want to spoil the story but if you like World War Z you will enjoy this novel, but it definitely does not have the same political agenda or commentaries on society. It is a pure survivalist tale, a little reminiscent of The Road but with zombies and not cannibals."
3,Good read for zombie fans,"I have to give Bourne credit for completing and self publishing a novel at all, but personal kudos aside, Bourne would be hard pressed to find a publisher willing to print his story in its current state. I wonder if the narrative style here is deliberate, but more often than not I think Bourne is simply writing the manner most comfortable for him. He story is obviously a ""here's what I would do if zombies took over the world"" fantasy realization for him. I will say that for an avid zombie fan this is not a bad read as the story makes up for serious lack of depth in sentence structure or vocabulary. For someone wanting to get into the zombie scene or just looking for a good read, I would suggest passing this up. The ending did leave a bit lacking but there seems to be a sequel in the works though the teaser chapter does not contain the same characters from this novel. In that aspect, I guess we will have to wait and see."
4,A genuinely good read. Thought provoking.,"Some people have trashed this book for it's pace, or the way that it's written. It's not Shakespeare but it is interesting. The time spent on specific preparations for the disaster should make you all reevaluate your own preparations for any crises. It's easy to pick up, but I found that I had to read it in one sitting I could not put it down. It's a disaster story more than a strict ""Zombie Novel"" and so there's not a ton of gore or zombie battles going on. The characters were a little formulaic I thought but they weren't unbelievable. As far as any ""right leaning"" concepts I didn't really see them. Take the book at face value and have a good time with it."
4,Happily surprised!,"This was my first Zombie book & I loved it. I like post-apocalyptic type stories so I rushed to read Max Brooks' zombie books next, but was disappointed with them. ""Day by Day Armageddon"" would make a great movie. Hope a part 2 will be coming soon."
3,Good Read,"I tore through this book in about 3 days. It evoked great imagery and really took me there painting a good picture of what was going on.The ending really disappointed as it could have easily been left as a cliff hanger, but the scene was completed and one was left with the feeling of ""is that it?""Looking forward to the second one as certain things were left unexplained that I want to know about!Over all, it was a good book. A solid 3 stars (Lord of the Rings being 5)"
3,entertaining,"I occasionally read zombie books. I get the itch every couple of months to pick up a good book and read it. The book wasn't bad; it just couldn't stand up to ""World War Z"" which was my previously read book. The format perhaps is what made the pages short and didn't allow any depth to enter the story. Still a good zombie read. Entertaining"
5,Awesome,I think that this is probably the greatest zombie novels I have read. I can't wait for the next book.
5,Best zombie novel by far!!,This book made me feal like this could actually happen. The journalistic aproach was an awesome way to go. It made the book much more interesting . It made me want to just keep reading to see if the guy's situation would get any better. This book is a must read for any zombie fans out there.
5,I've reread this book at least a dozen times while waiting for the sequel to come out...,"I've read a vast number of zombie books, and Day by Day Armageddon is one of the absolute best. Initially I thought that the journal-style of the book might annoy me, but I quickly fell into the story and completely forgot about the format. Bourne is a master of creating an intense, suspenseful situation and will quickly suck you in to this story.I got this book for Christmas two years ago, and I had finished reading it before bed that night. It's so very hard to put it down! If you're looking for a well-written, George Romero style zombie novel, go for this one."
4,Engaging Zombie Fiction - Recommended,"I am a zombie and apocalypse survivor story fan, so this book was a dead on hit for me (no pun intended). This engaging story is presented in diary form, with mostly short entries in the beginning and somewhat longer ones towards the end as the story unfolds. We never learn the name of the military officer who kept the journal, but it starts just before the zombie plague spreads and ends somewhat abruptly (leaving a clear place for the sequel, which is due in mid-2010).This was a fairly quick read and I finished it in one sitting. I liked the journal format as it made the story move very quickly, but at times it felt like I was reading the ""Cliff Notes"" of a more in-depth book. This didn't detract much for me, but my wife wanted more detail.This is a good fit for fans of the genre and even contains a few surprises for hard core zombie fans.Highly Recommended!CFH"
4,"A very good read, worth picking up but a little ""too perfect"" for my tastes=",Let me be clear from the start - I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Fans of zombie apocalypse speculative fiction would be well served picking up this book if they have not already done so. The author is clearly intelligent and has done his research and his attention to detail is fantastic.My problem is that the story is a little bit too perfect - the protagonist is just too good at what he does and his luck appears to be just too good. There doesn't appear to be a single skill or ability that he or his crew doesn't have to tackle the myriad of situations they're faced with. This is not a story about your `average joe' who rises to the nigh impossible challenge of surviving in a world filled with the undead. It's more like MacGyver vs. the Undead.
5,its a book that put you into his world,you feel what he's going through and can tell the thought he put into the storyline. very nice and different book.
3,Solid fast paced novel,"Day by Day Armageddon was a good book, but like other reviews have noted it really lacks any type of character development beyond the main character.The plot was inviting, but at times really predictable. However, I loved the fast paced movement of the novel. I read the whole thing in a day.The author has a great imagination, but he needs to stop with the military mumbo jumbo and needs to focus his prose on character developmentand descriptiveness of the zombies and the chaos around him."
3,Surprisingly well written,"Didn't expect much from a ""Zombie Novel"" but this was actually pretty well written.I would recommend this for the zombie lovers everywhere.You know who you are."
4,Quite the awesome journal of the apocalypse,"Day by Day Armageddon is a book that I think I had placed in my shopping cart upwards of 10 times only to remove it. Eventually, I ended up buying it and was quite pleased with it. The book tells of a man on the run from a zombie outbreak that somehow manages to keep a daily journal of the events. The book is very gory and I will commend it on that. It manages to scare without over-the-top hijinks (not that I have a problem with over-the-top hijinks!) but if you are a fan of the zombie genre, do pick this one up.Also, I've read a lot of people complain about the writing. One thing you have to remember is that this book is supposed to be kept by a military pilot on the run from zombies - I think the diction works. I'm not for a moment saying that the the typos and grammatical mistakes were intentional, but they add to the journey nonetheless."
4,I read it in 2 evenings.....Not Bad....,"Having read some of the other reviews and the less thanglowing comments, I don't agree with most of them. True,this is not the ""normal"" Zombie story that we have beenreading forever. I like the way Mr. Bourne differs fromthe ""format"" many have grown used to reading. This storyis written in the form of a journal and I find that aninteresting and different view of a Very Bad New Worldthe writer finds himself in. Is it a ""text"" book way toteach us about how to survive in a Zombie World, NO it isfiction for crying out loud. I like Zombie books of ALLkinds and have already ordered the next 2 in this series.Am I ready for the Zombie Invasion of 2012? Not yet butI am getting there. Are You? Something is coming our way,and remember Zombies come in MANY WAYS. Enjoy this story,or is it indeed only a story....."
3,"very ""Guy"" book","this is really good but a very GUY book. The guy lives ready for a zed invasion. I mean who lives like that? It would be more intrasting if he were a normal person and had to servive, but he is a trained military guy who is perfectly capable of surviving ZED"
4,way to go Mr Bourne (if that is your real name ;),"Good 1st go at the zombie genre - could you let us know when the 2nd one is coming out?!? The only thing that keeps the book from 5 star status (besides spelling, punc., errors) is the fact that we need a follow up in order to help with this cliffhanger! Please help us out and get another book out that can solve some of the open issues from the 1st excellent book. Cool that is is ""self"" published - lets hear it for the little guy!"
3,Over rated - Good but not great,Some very interesting scenarios and as is pointed out in many reviews this is a diary style book and the author did not develop he characters - they lacked depth. An easy read and not worth $9.99 price tag. Recommend world war Z instead
5,Great read!!,"I LOVED this book!! I am a huge Zombie fan. This book had it all... suspense, lots of zombies, terror, and more zombies. I read this book so fast because it was so suspenseful that I couldn't put it down. This is exactly what I would want in zombie fiction. Never a dull moment!"
4,Great -Journal Format- story.,"I've found Day by Day Armageddon to be a very entertaining book. So entertaining, that I actually finished it in two days. Literally a non-stop.However, there's one thing that I should clarify. It's not precisely a novel, but more like a ""fiction diary"".You'll find colloquial language and not precisely the smoothest writing style. But hey! It's supposed to be a diary after all, so the author can get away with that.If you're a fan of the genre, and think you would be ok with the journal format of the book (I actually rather enjoyed it), then you should definitely read it."
4,A solid entry.,"Day by Day Armageddon is the story about a military aviators struggle for survival in the zombie apocalypse. Its presented uniquely through a diary type format which some will either love or hate. I personally found it interesting and it seemed to work well with the story.The story itself was well thought out, engaging and well paced. The main character did seem a little to prepared but the ideas presented arnt to far fetched Their are many survivalist among us believe it or not ).I do however, have a couple of complaints about the book. A couple of the characters served no purpose and added absolutely no value to the story. Its as if they were introduced to late in the story then forgetten and all focus was put into the ending. Which leads me to my next complaint, the ending felt rushed and sloppy (most likely due to there being a sequel).At the end of the day the book was quick and enjoyable which resulted in a solid novel."
4,Good Zombie Book,"This is a pretty decent book. I enjoy the journal entry perspective although sometimes I wonder how he has the time and or paper to write such lengthy entries. It allows you to immerse yourself in the story.The zombies appear mostly mindless and are somewhere between slow and fast zombies.My only gripe with the book is that the main character seems to be great at everything he does. He never seems to make a mistake which makes it difficult to associate with the main character. Otherwise, it is a good zombie book well worth the read."
2,Needs an Editor,"This book is basically a plot-less tale of survival in the zombie apocalypse. Very little character development, very little action, and no clear plot. The best part of the book are the last 20 pages or so, and even those events end in a trite manner. I can't recommend this book as it's nothing particularly memorable or worth reading. I don't want to bash the author but it's clear this book would have been a lot better if there were an editor involved - someone to correct grammar and more importantly to tell the writer to develop and polish an outline for the story they are trying to tell. There's no story being told at all, just a log of someone trying to survive. Reading a book that has no arc and no character development means it's a throwaway story because there's nothing or no one to care about."
1,Crap would be an understatement for this book,"I know it was written by an amateur, which is stated in the book, but that doesn't excuse it. IMHO, the book was glib and boring. Nothing new, no ambiance created in work, no texture of storytelling.If you've never read a zombie novel before, then this one might seem interesting, but in the end it's a wash."
4,"If you want toast, use a toaster.","This book is what it is - a military guy's day by day journal of a zombie Apocalypse. I was put off at first by the style/format of the writing, but if you're trying to write a novel in the journal style, Bourne makes it work. His pacing is fine, he doesn't worry about character development, he just tells the story. I initially thought Day by Day Armageddon was some first year creative writing students' fan fiction, but I kept reading it. And the fact it kept my interest and I made an effort to get back to the book must mean Bourne did exactly what he wanted to. I could crab about some elements, but, hell, it's an easy read and a memorable book."
2,Day by day aramaddon,"It was okay but, it was a little to slow and the discriptions just go on forever making this book much longer than it should be."
5,Great!,"Great book - I would recommend to anyone interested in zombie themed or Armageddon/apocalypse themed stories. The book goes into great detail regarding weapons used, defense setups and strategy for survival which movies always seem to gloss over."
5,RaptorMan ROCKS!,I've thought this guy was great since I found him on the net a long time ago. His publishing of the original on-line journal just shows that he has the mettle it takes to survive an undead world. I'm waiting now for the next installment!Nemain
4,Bring on volume two!,The journal format is a unique take on the genre and I especially like the detailgiven to gear and survival methods. The author obviously knows his stuff. What's also impressive is that this novel is self published. I'm surprised someone hasn't taken notice and offered J.L. Bourne a publishing deal. He's good!
5,Day by day Armageddon,"This was a book I could not put down. I don't believe I have ever burned through 200 pages so fast.. except maybe for the Fairtax book.I look forward to the continuation of this story, and hope it surpasses book 1 by leaps and bounds."
4,Manages to be fresh in a very stale genre.,"I bought Day by Day Armageddon based on its good reviews and I have to say I was very impressed. It's not easy to get your heart rate up when so much zombie fiction is indistinguishable these days. This story has a great balance of fleshed-out characters you care about, the overall picture and the nuts and bolts of survival in an impossible situation. The story loses some steam once the group gets to the military complex... but I really enjoyed it overall. This book deserves it success and I believe it surpasses what was done by Max Brooks in World War Z."
5,Outstanding!,I have loaned this book to several people and I have not received anything less than a glowing review.
5,Must read imo,I enjoyed this book. I never thought it would be cool read another person's journal including one found in a zombie infested world. I can't wait for the sequel and i hope it will be up on Kindle 2. Continue the great work J.L. Bourne.
4,Excellent.,"I bought this on a lark and was incredibly suprised! I read it in less than a day and I am usually a real slow reader. My wife, who hates all things horror or Sci-Fi read it in just a few hours - she loved it and even passed it to her g/f's who only like popular books like Harry Potter or Davinci Code and they loved it too. This grabs you, pulls you in and wont let you go.My only complaint is it is too short - I wanted more, more, more!Cant wait for the follow up and hopefully, the movie.This was more entertaining than most of the zombie movies made recently.Kick butt!"
3,Re done,"Nearly all of this was on his web page free. When I emailed him to see if there was any new material in the book, he was rude to me."
5,Bridget's Review,A new kind of terror is lurking in the shadows. It seems the dead have found a way to rise again and they are determined to rule indefinitely. One man has taken it upon himself to stand against them and try to rid the world of this evil. This is his story.Amazingly vivid. A truly horrific book - this is meant as a huge compliment. I'm a huge zombie fan and this is one of the best zombie tales I've read yet.
3,"wow, paid too much!!!","Not bad. But, I paid full retail. Too much. Ok...there are better z books out there. See my other reviews if you want. I will read volume 2 but I will never get sucked in to a $20.00 Z book again. Not my top 20!!!!"
5,Excellent!,"Really enjoyed this book, the writing style, the fast pace, the characters... will read again because the novel is just a plain good read!"
5,"Great book, now I'm on Book 2","There is already numerous reviews on this. I could not put this book down and I passed it to a friend who read it through the night. I'm on book 2 which read more like a novel, another 5 star book. If you like Zombie stories, you will like this one. I also read World War Z which got me started on zombie books."
5,"Great Book, possibly my favorite zombie novel.","If you love the bloody, gore, and violent zombie scenario this is the book for you.The style of the book being written in journal format really kept me hooked not tomention the main character's sense of survival. The main character isn't looking fora permanent area to hide out in nor is he looking for a cure, he is simply surviving bykeeping a new nomadic lifestyle. I recommend this book, it was great hopefully sequelis just as good if not better."
4,Really Enjoyable,Excellent zombie fiction. The main character is interesting and beliveable. As an ex-military man I enjoyed the fact that the main character was active duty military. The action is good although the main way the characters deal with the zombies is to be real quiet so they are not discovered. One action scene where the protaganists parachute from an airport tower seemed silly and contrived and a romantic subplot is hinted at but never materializes. Despite these minor flaws (as well as a few editing problems) I found the book to be a real page turner and hope for a sequel in the near future.
3,"A Fast Food Zombie Book - not great, but good for a quick bite","Nothing really new or groundbreaking in this book. The only interesting idea, without hopefully giving too much away, was the affects of radiation on zombies.Being written in a journal format makes it easy to read an entry, go do something else, come back and read another, go do something else, repeat. I finished the book in two hours while scanning some documents. While books like World War Z and the Morningstar Virus books spank this one, I have come across some zombie stinkers much worse than this book.I have some issues with the fictional author of the diary being military and spending his time cleaning guns and lamenting his situation instead of modifying his environment or making more use of the knowledge that fire will kill the zombies. If you have time to lean, you have time to clean."
3,Not bad,"Not a bad book as far as zombie literature goes, but not nearly as great as World War Z. The main character decides to start a daily journal, and quickly notes a virus sweeping China. Well, you know what happens next. In a few weeks the world is populated by flesh eating zombies. What I didn't buy was the part of the main character keeping a journal, especially when he was on the run. On some days, he has pages and pages of what happened during that day, in great detail. Personally, if I was being chased by flesh eating zombies, I don't think I would have the time, energy or inclination to write entries in a daily journal each day, in long hand. But if you can get past that, the book isn't all that bad. I would usually read it before bed to help put me to sleep."
5,Action and Zombie Lovers Get Ready.,"This was one of the most creative books I've yet to read in the Zombie genre, Mr. Bourne takes it to a new level with the journal format he uses.This is a quick and enjoyable read. I cant wait for the next installment.Strap in for a great ride!"
2,poorly written with inaccurate tech details,"Reads like a high schooler's zombie fan fiction. I get that it wasn't written by a ""professional"" but the journal format is just an excuse for the author to write badly and mix up homophones. ""To"" for ""too"", ""lightening"" for ""lightning"", ""breaks"" for ""brakes"", it goes on and on. Get an editor. What was the point of the girl rescued from the car? I think she disappeared at one point for like 50 pages.For a story so hung up on technical details it's surprising that there wasn't more accuracy in the aviation bits. As a flight instructor myself these are somewhat glaring errors. According to the author, the hydraulic brakes in a Cessna 172 don't work too well when the engine's off. Oh really. There are lots of little mistakes like this that show the author's lack of research and attention to details."
5,"Lock, Load & Kill Some Zombies","My opinion - Borne is the BEST zombie fiction writer today! All around great writing, superb story, solid characters, and an exciting edge of your seat read. Plenty of other detailed reviews but I could not put the book down! Highest Recommendation!"
3,Half-decent romp through familiar territory.,"A worthwhile read if you're a big zombies fan. I was a bit annoyed by how hollow the protagonist felt at times, and how contrived his apocalypse preparations felt, but the plot hooks kept me in some suspense. An intrinsic problem with the diary format is you know the protagonist has survived. On top of this the other characters never felt well developed enough for me to care about their fates."
4,Pretty good,"It's not the best zombie book around, and I found alot of typo's. But it keeps you interested enough to want to keep reading.Looking forward to the sequel."
1,Why?,"I understand that is written as a journal but the writing is so incredibly bad that it's barely readable! Poor grammar, word usage, sentence formatting, syntax, and bad analogies combine to make this one of the worst books I have read in awhile. This book makes it seem as if the journals' author barely made it past 8th grade english, in my opinion. A bad buy for my $11; I'll be buying no more books in this series. I really don't understand how everyone can be giving this book such high ratings."
2,Not pleased at t'all !!,"After reading the first two books in a matter of days i was so much looking forward to the third and (perhaps)final book to the story?The first problem being that I wasn't sure if I'd still be alive by the time it was released? I was beginning to wonder if Mr. Bourne and George Martin were playing golf together down in Santa Fe?After the release date was moved back, Shattered Hourglass was mine to buy, I did ... not Narrated like the first two and it seemed like someone else wrote this? It was so rushed at the end that I felt cheated out of a Great story?Of course it's only one mans opinion?"
3,"Not the best, not the worst either","I had expected more from this book. The plot and the events in it are so similar to other zombie fiction and movies (especially 28 Days Later) that I have to wonder how much is original. It was entertaining, but I don't feel compelled to wait for a sequel or to pick it up and read it again. The characters are the strongest part, they react to events like real people and not stereotypes, but the book as a whole is very unoriginal."
1,What a rip off,Ok story but come on 11 dollars for a couple of Hundred pages...and then I found out after buying it I could have bought the 1st and second books (Paper backs together)for $12 and change. What a rip off
1,A good idea that suffers from terrible execution,"The journalistic approach this book takes to the end-of-the-world-by-zombies is a great idea, but unfortunately it reads like a high school book report, complete with the awful character development, grammatical errors, and terrible wordcraft. The main characters are completely generic without any of the emotional content that would naturally go along in a story like this. The descriptive language is repetitive, awkward and cheesy during the fight scenes. The book ends way too abruptly without any sort of closure. I don't care who the author is in real life, he can't write fiction."
1,Are You a Child?,"This is seriously the worst book I almost read. By that I mean I absolutely tried to finish it and couldn't. (And I finished Clown Girl which I didn't think was possible). I love zombies but this time I want to hit Bourne with my copy until I get my money back and he becomes one. Unless you are illiterate, mentally handicapped, or seven don't read this book because it will be a waste of your cognitive capacities. Hands down the #1 worst book I have ever read."
3,A nice read for zombie fans,"It was clear from the beginning that a lot of thought had gone into the creation of this novel. As a big fan of the zombie genre, I found that Day by Day Armageddon definitely has some interesting plot lines and thought provoking takes on surviving the imminent zombie apocalypse. However, I would describe the writing style as somewhat simplistic in nature, and without spoiling the content, I sometimes found myself thinking that things seemed to work out a little too conveniently for the main characters at times, which tends to diminish the realistic feel of the book. These are minor complaints though, and overall I thought the book was worth the price tag. Fans of the zombie genre will not be dissappointed."
4,Satisfying Zombie Action/Great Kindle edition,"This is an excellent Zombie story, with some great set pieces (some of the escapes our characters have to make are very exciting). I took off a star because it doesn't add much to zombie lore (these are closely related to the Romero zombies) and some of the developments feel a bit too formulaic (possible dangerous biker gangs, humans becoming a more dangerous enemy, etc.) It's not bad, but it just felt like those moments were included because they ""had to be"" rather than the story demanded them.I'm really interested in the government intrigue introduced in the story (who controls the government? Did all of the military defect? Can anyone claiming to be the official government be trusted?). I hope the sequel addresses this issue.The Kindle edition is well formatted (the few typos appear to be intentional), though some of the drawings/pictures are a bit too blurry."
5,awesome series!,I would highly recommend this book/series. Hands down the best zombie book I have had the pleasure to have come across. Most of the zombie books I have come across I throw out before im just a few pages in to as either they dont make sense or are boring as hell. This book is a real treat and makes you comming back for more.
5,Good story!,The author definitely injects his own experience and knowlege to this novel (minus of course the zombies). I can very much feel the military background of the author and the events are really well laid out and covered in a realistic journal form.
4,"Meh, not too bad.","I'm a huge fan of ""zombie material"", and this book definitely has some truly amazing moments. However the ending is abrupt without any real closure and the pacing is a little strange at times. Even so, the book knows how to make the audience trip balls and keep them interested and tense throughout pretty well."
3,Ok. Short for the price. Needs another Edit,"The book used ""to"" in place of ""too"" at least 4 times. I noticed some others errors as well. And I am not a careful editor. I read quickly and tend to miss little things like that, so odds are there are lots of editing errors I missed.The book is ok. As noted by others, thin characters and not much story. I still found it compelling enough to read.As noted by others, the story ends abruptly. This is a pretty short book for the price. The rating most people are giving it is just too high."
4,Keeps you reading,I really enjoyed this book and could not put it down.The first person perspective works and keeps your interest.I look forward to the sequel.I give it four stars as I reserve 5 stars only for a masterpiece.
4,Very good read!,Do not listen to the few negative reviews for this novel. It's very good and is meant to be read like someone's personal journal not as a routine story. Keep that in mind and you will be drawn in.
3,Not too shabby,"I was on the fence between 3 and 4 stars for this book. It's an interesting read, and pretty well written to boot. The main character gets into some unique situations. The only problem I had was that there wasn't much in the way of character development. This is partly due to the ""journal of a survivor"" format the book takes, and you never have the opportunity see things from other people's perspectives. Bourne also writes relatively little about the people the main character encounters. If he pens a few sequels, maybe the characters will become a bit more fleshed out and lively. Near the end of the book was also a bit dissapointing. I wouldn't want to spoil it, but the main character gets -rediculously- lucky finding something.Overall nice story, and easy read. I reccomend it."
1,A very juvenile read.,Ack. Where to start? Small vocabulary hinders this short story. Page after page is predictably chunked out in the same fashion. To further degrade this zombie novel author seems to be living out a personal fantasy rather than hooking the reader with a plot. All this would not be bad if his main character wasn't a wimpy nerd geek that feels uncomfortable when he hasn't shaved for a few days. The main character as well as the minuscule development just does not fit with a person that survives the zombie hordes. Day by Day Armageddon is a less than average try at a novel and should have been a free read on the internet bulletin boards. There are far better zombie novels to spend money on.
1,Jumping on the Zombie Bandwagon (and falling off badly),"The premise was very good, but the military hero's daily diary was not dynamic enough to hold my attention. I also have serious problems with absolutely wretched editing. The author promises a sequel. Please, NO!!!!"
2,over priced for a simple story,"Well, what does a fan of zombies not a fanatic say about a book with so many good reviews, even the preface got me going. I won't say this is the best book ever so pick it up but damn the ebook version not worth the price. yeah, yeah, ex millitary but some time I just began to get a little confused with the times because it seemed some times was it day or night dusk or dawn. I still use the 24 hour clock in my day to day life. Also seemed to do some filling in with the same stuff a few times. his detail of the area of texas was nice because its in my back yard. I'll give it a few weeks before i read the second one."
3,A cut above,"This one was perilously close to two stars, having received a significant penalty for including the word ""mist"" with any of ""brain,"" ""head"" or ""skull."" But contrary to one reviewer's opinion, the grammar was actually a cut above some of the other...product...out there. I think this might be some of the Permuted Press output, you can pretty much tell that what goes in is what comes out without any kind of pesky editor interfering in the process. Thankfully, J.L. Bourke appears to be able to string a sentence together. Decent storyline, decent characters, not too many cringes."
5,One of the best Zombie books I have read in a long time.,J.L. Bourne has a classic on his hands here. I love books about the end of the world and Zombie infestation I have always been a Zombie lover since the first time I watched the original Night of The Living Dead. I would only assume that the author is in or was in the military or has done extensive research on military terms and aeronautics. I couldn't put the book down once I picked it up. I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I read the book in one day and cannot wait till the next installment comes out. I was in the Marines and love all the military references and how he portrays the government in times of turmoil. I highly highly highly recommend this book to anyone who loves Zombie literature. If you like Max Brooks you'll love J.L. Bourne.
4,awesome but short,great book wish it was longer other then that great buy for the money would highly recomend to zombie fans
3,Good read,I liked the premise of the story and the viewpoint. But I found it a little slow sometimes. I'll probably read the rest of the series however.
2,shood bee free,"this is something a buddy writes and says read this! you read it then say ""that was really good"". to say it is great? yuck. world war z is a zombie classic- this one is an enthusiasts solid effort...not worth 10 bucks! please get an editor....the spelling errors are so easy to fix...another set of eyes is all it takes."
2,day by day armageddeon,"the book shoulda stated that it was part 1......it left me hanging for an ending, and the rest of the middle. its like leaving the theatre right when the movie starts getting good."
4,Fun Read,"I really enjoyed this book, had a real feel to it and had that ""trapped"" feeling while reading it. I do look forward to a sequel by this author.My only critique would be the characters weren't fleshed out other than the main."
5,Awesome!,"If you're Conan the Grammarian and have the urge to impale yourself on your own sword every time you see a spelling or grammatical error in a book, you might want to pass on this. If, on the other hand, you want to read an awesome book about the zombapocalypse, then get this book now... and while you're at it get DBDA2: Beyond Exile. Its in stock now!"
3,Took a minute...,"But it finally warmed up around the last 2/3 of the story.Two things that where just ridiculous 1.In a apocalypse he manages to find every single thing he needsplanes,night vision,ammo,food,weapons,super secure underground misslebase,the holy grale ect... 2.this seems to be a really common problem in almost every ""zombie apocalypse"" book Ive read BAD ONE DIMENSIONAL characters.It was good enough to read the sequel however."
4,Creative ways to make studying easier,"I purchased this book to assist my two of my children with study skills because they were getting ready to attend a more competitive school. I think some of the ideas like learning through visualization work well in theory but getting a child to do it isn't always that easy. On the other hand, my kids were able to grasp the ideas of time management, better note taking and organizational skills a lot easier. I think it's a good reference but parents/teachers have to spend some time with their kids getting them to understand the concepts. I do recommend this."
1,Gonzo Stain Remover,"Product said it would work on red stains, i.e. punch etc. It didn't even lighten the stains...did not work at all, very disappointed and will not purchase from this company again."
2,Did Not Work,"I bought this product with such high hopes after reading all of the positive reviews and I must say I was extremely dissappointed. I tried this on three different stains (urine, clothing and a stain on my sofa) and it did absolutely nothing. This product is a complete waste of money!"
5,Why did I use Lemi Shine for so long?,"I've got a well and VERY hard water, and scale is a problem in this house. For years I've usedLemi Shinein the dishwasher, in the laundry rinse cycle, and to clean sinks and bathtubs. Because Lemi Shine is even more expensive here than it is locally, I figured I'd try citric acid.I wish I'd tried it years ago. It works just as well as Lemi Shine, and is far cheaper. Packaging wasn't a problem, since it was double-bagged. I didn't want to store it in a plastic bag, so I refilled my old Lemi Shine container (about 12 ounces worth) and then poured the rest into a 2-litre bottle. It was a perfect fit, and seems to be keeping the citric acid from clumping.I've signed up for Subscribe and Save. If you've got hard water, I recommend this."
5,"If you have a front loading washer, buy this ! No more musty smell","After years of having a smelly front loading washing machine and trying so called cleaners from Tide and others, this actually worked. A few detergent scoops of citric acid, boiling water poured into the drum and the machine set on wash. After the wash cycle was completed, I stopped the machine, let it sit with the water still in the drum. Finished the wash cycle in the morning and drained the clean out hose and lint trap. After repeating this again, no more mildew, musty odor! ! ! This big bag of citric acid is handy because I also use this in the dishwasher in the main wash cup with detergent in the pre wash cup for spot free glasses."
4,Cost effective savior for hard water problems,"This has been a great way to deal with the problem of hard water. (VERY big problem in my area). I just add it in the extra detergent dish, and everything comes out great. It has even gottonbetter with time as the accumulated gunk has cleared out. Highly recommend."
5,Good product,I got rid of just about all the deposits (after 7 years of usage) in the 4 liter Z hot water pot after cleaning the pot 5 times with citric acid. I had better results in my last 2 attempts using 4 tablespoonfuls of citric acid. This product is certainly much cheaper than the product sold by the manufacturer of hot water pot.
3,Good rust remover,"I use the citric acid to remove rust from my dad's old tools. It is simple and does the job well. When finished, I dry the tools and usually spray them with some kind of protective spray or I may paint them with Rustoleum. I don't usually measure the solution, but I started out using a 5-10% solution years ago, and i just eye ball it now. The mixture is not harmful so I just dump the remaining solution in the back yard."
5,Consistently sized granules,"I have purchased a lot of citric acid from iffy sources and been disappointed by it's lack of purity. So, I was very happy to see Amazon carrying a good quality citric acid at an affordable price. The granules in the Spicy World Citric Acid all seem uniform (important when you want consistent results), the color is good (no yellowing), it wasn't clumped or sticky. I will definitely buy this again."
2,item okay but poor packaging,"***this 5 pounds of citric acid was ordered 6-20-11, arrived 6-27-11. order was fulfilled by amazon and sent in a plastic bag inside a cardboard box with no additional padding to protect it in transit. fortunately the box suffered no damage so contents arrived safely. had there been damage to the box it is highly likely that the bag could have been punctured and the citric acid granules would have then spilled out. i do not recommend that you buy this sort of item from amazon-my personal experience with merchandise packaged by amazon is usually that no padding whatsoever is used or that the padding is insufficient and not properly placed between the product and outer box.the citric acid meets the need for which it was bought.***"
5,dishwasher acting better now,"I bought this because I have really hard well water and my dishwasher cleans but my glasses are cloudy. So I started making my own dishwasher detergent out of a cup of washing soda a cup of boraz a half cup of salt and a half cup of citric acid. It is a wonderful rinse agent. I have also used this to freeze peaches. It keeps the peaches bright in color. Since my glasses are coming out cleaner, I'm happier so citric acid is a great mood enhancer around my home."
1,this sucked,arrived all clumpy and hard (huge clumps as hard as rocks). i was going to make bath bombs out of this but don't have the time to take a chisel to it. should not have arrived this way. will not purchase again.
1,don't waste your money,"vienna have other products that is very good, but this one i think is the worst one she have. for that prise i thought that will be something really good. i just waste my money. the produt is a powder that you need to mix it with water to scrub your face it's very missy. it took for ever to clean it from the face. is just a waste of time and money that's all."
3,"Decent knives, but you can do better for the price","These knives are serviceable. They come well packaged, the construction seems solid, and the balance is nice. They take an edge fairly well. They are not extraordinary. I suspect you can find similar quality cheaper (or better quality for the price). That said, they are good enough, and I won't be returning them--so I can't make specific recommendations about where else to look."
2,not up to Ms. Barton's standards,"These two annoyed me. Hank and Susan have wanted each other for years. Hank and Susan are pregnant because Susan's dead husband begged Hank to donate his sperm. When we get to the real story, both the h & h lack the courage to go after what they really want - each other. Instead of being honest and talking with each other, they allowed themselves to be dictated by other people's opinions of how they should live their lives. This book was 200 pages of ""We shouldn't do this. We shouldn't feel this, but I really want you"" until they finally realized that as adults, they can do and feel whatever they please."
5,I thought that this book was a great book,"This book was a thriller. It kept you guessing at everything. The stange pictures and wird names took me many days to figure out how to solve them. I have read the first two but this one explains every thing that you would need to know. Every page brought new suspence. I would recomend this book to anyone that likes action, and magic books."
4,Blanchard Road a Murder in The Finger Lakes,"Sabina was my cousin and the only complaint I have about the video is they did not have a real picture of Sabina, only a drawing that apprently was a memorial drawing. The facts of the story hit right on to the real life corruption that occurs in this nation to convict the first person that has the slightest potential for guilt, bite marks....crazy. The defendant wrong place wrong time, no wrong threats right time and he paid for it by being railroaded and wrongly convicted. After the story watch the full interview with Roy Brown, ""Where is the Justice"" there was no Justice for Sabina.Jimmer Breck"
5,"Brilliant, creepy, ominous","Very creepy and ominous, with Ms. Germano whispering disturbing lyrics over a dark background. I like the comparison to Nick Drake's _Pink Moon_... except that _Geek_ is much darker. I have been trying to find a bad or throwaway song on the album and not succeeding. Definitely *NOT* the album to put on the CD player when you want a romantic evening though."
1,Better pictures on Ebay,"I bought this book based on the one review, and I have to completely disagree. The pictures in this one are dark and muddy, it's very hard to see details. And that's the point, isn't it? The cleaning and repairing chapter is moderately helpful if you have no clue. The chapters are arranged by COLORS. Not by designers, or eras, or anything else that might make sense. The author will mention that something is in the style of Schreiner, but never go into any detail about what that style might entail. A waste of money."
2,A few interesting things....,"This is one of the oddest collections of Broadway music ever put together. This collection of ""novelty songs"" includes some from classic musicals such as ""I can't say No"" from ""Oklahoma"", ""A Well Known Fact"" from ""I Do, I Do"" and a few others. It also contains one of the worst songs ever recorded - ""Chicken is He"" as well as ""Mama will Provide"". Some of the lesser known songs such as ""Arthur in the Afternoon"" and the ""Crossword Puzzle"" are pleasant but this isn't one you'll listen to again and again."
4,Order The Cheaper One,"I ordered this Kitchen Supply bowl based on the reviews, but Amazon sent me the Anchor Hocking bowl instead. While it appears to be similar enough to keep, I'm a bit disappointed that Amazon would substitute without asking. At any rate, the Anchor Hocking is a few dollars less and you might save some money by ordering it instead.Update: If you zoom in on the lid, you will find that the bowl in the product picture is Anchor Hocking. When I reported this apparent error to Amazon, they responded that the image was correct. This suggests that Kitchen Supply buys their batter bowl from Anchor Hocking, so that there is no difference and no reason to pay more."
4,Love the Lid,"This is the second one of these I've owned. Not because there was anything wrong with the first one, but just because it seemed to get left behind the last time I moved. I had to replace as soon as I noticed it had gone missing.I really love how secure the lid fits on, much better than all the other measuring bowls I've seen. Great for making batter or other things that you want to be able to measure/store/pour.My only complaint is that I wish the handle was open at the bottom so that I could stack it inside of other things with the handle outside of the bowl. But this is a minor complaint."
2,Doesn't pour,"I bought this bowl because I frequently work with straining and pouring a gallon of liquid at a time into narrow bottles, and I wanted to have a larger bowl to work with than my trusty 1 quart Pyrex. This is an Anchor product. I love that it has a lid that fits snugly, and I use this to store things like soup in the refrigerator, so it's not totally useless (hence the 2 stars instead of 1), but in terms of what I bought it for it is a huge fail. The spout does not narrow the flow of the liquid at all. In fact, it's messy and spills everywhere. It caused me great frustration until I just decided to stop trying. It is easier to pour neatly out of my 8 quart stock pot, off the straight sides, to be honest! I am very disappointed with this product and I'm sorry I tried to save money by getting an inferior product. I'm going with the 2 quart Pyrex instead. Lesson learned."
2,Solid but too heavy,"Good quality glass but too heavy. Had I known how heavy they were I would not have purchased them. The lids do not seal well and liquids pour out easily, specially when children carry them..."
5,I agree - Awesome bowl!,"I've had my batter bowl for about 2 years now, and have used it a lot in the past. I used to make my own ice cream and tried to make enough ice cream to last for a bit. This bowl is large enough to accommodate a good amount of stuff in it and was the perfect size for me for the amount that I made (a lot). Also, with the lid, I was able to cool the custard overnight in this bowl, which was really handy.While I did have some problems pouring it into the ice cream maker while it is spinning on the kitchenaid, I can't say that this was the fault of this bowl. With the spinning attachment in the ice cream maker, you don't have a lot of room to get it in there. The other reviewers indicating that they had problems pouring when the bowl was full maybe right. However, for me this is a minor issue with an otherwise great bowl.Made in the USA and a solid product. Worth it."
3,Great stuff!!,"Haven't has a chance of using its yet, cause the glove is to small for my hand. Have to send its back but the thing look and feel really good, well made material"
1,dispointed,"I ordered the Small/Medium, Yellow, Left and right-hand seperatelly but got 2 Right-hands in diffrent colour, one in yellow and another one in red.Finally, I have a pair of Lindy gloves with both are right-hand in diffrent colour.I am going to leave USA on Nov.9 that means NO time for me chang the right one.really dispointed."
4,Best Vocalist in Power Metal,"I am new to the genre of power metal. I'm more of a Cannibal Corpse kind of gal. However, when I heard that voice, I couldn't get enough of it. This guy can really sing! A lot of bands try too hard to sound like opera stars, but Falconer has serious vocal talent. I don't have the know-how to break down the music and really give you a detailed review of this album. But I can tell you that the album has standard renaissance rhythms that I found very enjoyable and even infectious. I just wanted to inform everybody out there that no matter what your metal taste, if you have an ear for quality vocals, you need to listen to this album."
2,Disappointing Follow up.,"I have to disagree with most of the reviews on Falconer's 2nd.The cd just doesn't cut it. The debut is much better in allareas. The songs on Chapters.. are just not as memorable as those on the first release. The only exception is the opening track, which is quite good, but after that the album just falls flat. I love power-metal and Falconer is one of those bands thatare unique, but if you want their best, get the debut, you won'tbe disappointed like I was with this one."
3,"Expensive little things, aren't they?",The material is thicker than I thought it would be but it is still much better than the fleece for summer weather. I found this item to be difficult to find - maybe that is why it is so expensive?
5,Darnielle is a genius...,"When it comes to taking independent recordings to a limit, Darnielle manages to do so. Armed with just his acoustic guitar and a panasonic boombox, Darnielle's lyrical honesty and folk-driven guitar playing is immediately catchy and one that you have to listen to over and over again.Even with such a basic combination (man and a guitar), Darnielle's voice and style of music is instantly recognizable. With his nasal voice and stark observations on life, he manages to show the beauty in every day things and an apperciation of nature.To talk about this CD as a whole, it's one that you wouldn't normally pick up but when and if you did, it would be an instant classic to your collection. Full Force Galesburg is a CD that will constantly impress and demand repeated listenings."
4,Fautz,"good stuff for a historical interested European, who himself is a descendent of a four century old family of soldiers. Quality of the printed paper is rather poor."
3,Only Okay,I gave the book three stars for the information but the author's opinions make this book less valuable then it otherwise might have been. For instance he claims the fact that Jackson never lamented his decisions meant he never thought he made a mistake. Jackson wasn't the type of person to go around talking about feelings so no one knows if he did or not. Also the author claims he must have an child out of wedlock and cites sources (just the word sources and not actual people) while at the same time discounting others who claimed the rumors were a lie. The author is just a bit too judgmental and quick to believe things without any proof to back them up. The information may be okay but I found it hard to read with so many of the author's opinions being paraded around as facts.
3,Readable but not riveting,"The book was readable (appropriate for a general audience) and had footnotes with up-to-date information. I think it definitely debunked this larger-than-life figure, but I must admit that I was disappointed that the book wasn't more compelling to read---as one would the expect with a subject of such fame and notoriety. It actually made me wonder what all the hype was about over this general, besides his grueling long marches?....surely there's more to this man than what is being portrayed. I think Stonewall enthusiasts will the find this book kind of deflating. I may try reading another Stonewall bio (perhaps Burke Davis or James Robertson) for comparison (hopefully it will be a more enthrawling read)."
4,A brief look at the Pope,"I enjoyed Biography's coverage of the late Pope John Paul II.The video is too brief only 40 minutes long. The first 20 minutes talk about the years before his Pontificate. The last 20 minutes cover the time as Pope. It ends rather abruptly. Also, the video was filmed in the late 90's, six years before his passing on. There is no coverage of his final six years.For a pope who accomplished so much, I felt the covergage was too little. There are good interviews with Childhood friends of the Pope as well as one of his Biographers, Tad Szulc. One major theme is that this Pope helped bring a peaceful end to communism in Poland.The effort is well done but I found myself wanting more details and broader coverage.The DVD extras that are included are only text.Biography has done a good job one the video however if you only want to purchase one video, purchase Witness to Hope by Weigel."
5,WOW!,"A book-and-CD package devoted to new and unheard of musical instruments, full of magnificent photographs, informative text and great music, every page and every track overflowing with ideas and originality. Some of the world's most interesting and inventive musical instrument makers appear in the book with music from them included on the CD. This will become a collector's item."
5,Music of your dreams,"My experience as a seeker of just-so sounds has never been so rewarded in one place as in the "" place"" of this superb collection.It rewards on every level listening on every level .Isn't that your ultimate goal?-C"
2,Narrow shoe,I bought this shoe 1/2 size bigger than I usually wear and it was still too narrow. I gave it away.
2,Wish I bought an ipod,"I purchased this item for my five year old son since he was always after my ipod. However, I don't believe this item to be easy to use at all. My music is imported on itunes and I could not convert the files to MP3 format. We also had a hard time trying to figure out how to use the buttons and features. The item has many features, but it takes some time to figure out. If you don't have MP3 or WAV files of music, I suggest sticking with the ipod. A shuffle costs about 79 bucks, but so much easier to use."
3,Fair,"Product arrived quickly and in good condition, but is rather flimsy and broke quickly. Overall, it worked as a simple workout MP3 player for long enough that I didn't feel ripped off."
3,"Stiff 3rd, Okay 5","If you prefer your Sibelius tight and dark, this coupling is fine but I like my Sibelius open and bright. Davis is a great conductor but these performances sound stiff, although No. 5 has much more life. Nothing wrong with the marketplace price, but I would look elsewhere."
2,Sometimes Less Is Less,"Don't get me wrong. I'm a big fan of World Jazz (or Jazz Beat), a true coming together of the jazz tradition and some authentic world/folk music, such as Afro-Cuban jazz, or Celtic jazz. Leon Parker has proved in the past that he can make effective records in this musical mode.The problem with this outing is that there just isn't enough of musical substance here. While the formula is similar to his previous records, the results are inferior. Things are so stripped down that on some of the cuts virtually nothing happens. Personally, I think he's milked the minimalist formula as far as it can go, to the point of diminishing returns. For a much more successful disk using a similar approach, check out either one of bandmate Sam Newsome's CD's with his his group Global Unity (one or both of which I'll be reviewing soon)."
5,A first-person story of recovery,"Teen Rose can't help but relive the accident that left her older sister in a coma: her efforts to resolve or distract herself from the memories aren't working, and her family and friends are no help. Slowly she finds ways of working through her haunting memories in All Rivers Flow To the Sea, a first-person story of recovery."
2,poorly written and disappointing,"I loved Alison McGhee's Shadow Baby, so I was looking forward to reading this book. I was really disappointed with the writing and the lack of character development. I had a tough time getting through it."
4,the girl with shorts,"Jose cummings A2In my English class we just finshed reading Keeping the Moon,and it was okay.At first i thought it was going to be a girl book.Why well because in the front cover there is a girl in shorts in the back cover ththeir are flowers.But then when i started reading the book it wasn't a girl book.I think this book is for everybody to read not just girls."
3,ehhh,"This is a perdictable beach reading book. It was highly amusing and I enjoyed myself while reading it, but would I read it again? No. It was the first book in this genra I have read so I can not compare it to anything. I found the main character shallow and anoying. The story line was exsactly as I thought it would be. The saving grace was the scene where the main character and her two friends are dancing to 'first I was afraid I was petrafied I knew I could not live with out you by may side I spent so many nights alone thinken how you did me wrong and now I strong'"
3,Keeping the Moon,"Well, if it wasnt for my teacher Ms.Cummings I probably wouldn't have ever read this book. Keeping the Moon was OK in my opinion. It is a good book for teens who are in the range of 14-16 years old because you can relate to it. The book is about a 15 year old named Nicole, who moved in with her aunt in Colby, North Carolina, she is very self conscience about her looks. Shes fat and her lips turn people away from talking to her. This could relate to alot of teens because most high school students are trying to figure themselves out and are trying to become the person that they would like to be. Some parts of the book was hard for me to understand (maybe because its a chick book) but most of the events that happened were easy to understand.Last if you are the kind of person that is interested in teens or you are a teen, Keeping the Moon would be a great addition to your book collection."
4,Dessen lover,"I absolutely love Sarah Dessen! Her books are amazing, and really get the point of view of a teenage girl across. This was the last of the 5 of her books that I've read, and I loved it! The main character is a fifteen year old girl named Colie. After loosing 45 and a half pounds on her ""recently-slim"" mom's new diet plan, Colie finds herself in Colby, North Carolina. There, she is supposed to spend the summer with her Aunt Mira. Colie expects the worst but ends up finding out who she really is, and that even she has the ability to be special. Through the unexpected friendship with Isabel and Morgan, Colie learns that there's more to her than the ""used-to-be-fat"" and rumored ""easy"" girl that she has come to be recognized as, as well as the companionship of Norman, artist extrordinar and collector of everything! I sincerely recomned this book to anyone who's ever had or has self-esteem issues, a fan of Dessen, or any girl that wants something to do on a rainy day!"
3,Good message within a fun story,"This was the first Sarah Dessen book that I liked. It's very thought provoking and the characters are very relatable and real. The message is good, and I like seeing the character gain more self-esteem throughout the story. It's a good entertaining read."
3,"""okay""","I would have to say this book is just okay. At some parts, it really bored me. Other times I thought it was great!"
4,All depends on the person.,"First off, let me say I never would have touched this book if it wasn't a school assignment. A guy picking up a pink book just ain't right. But it WAS an assignment. So here we go:Girls: Lonely? Depressed? Just want to read a book out of total randomness? Then this is the book for you! This first-person novel is sure to enhance your knowledge and confidence in the world and life.Boys: Have some weird secret life you don't want your friends to know about? Then grab this book and get to the nearest bathroom stall...or closet. You might learn a thing or two about life.Personally, I enjoyed reading it (as long as nobody saw the pinkness). There was deep meaning and the characters seemed real.But you can buy it or leave it. It's all your choice."
5,Keeping the Moon,"I loved this book! I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read. Keeping the Moon really makes you think about life. I enjoyed reading about Colie and her fitness trainer mom,Kiki Sparks.I also like reading about her Aunt Mira and her new friends that she made. They are Isabel, Morgan, and Norman. The characters seem so real. I think that teeneagers especially would like it because it has to do with a teenage girl and her life at school, and with other people. This book tells you all the hard times that she went through and how she kept going even though she didn't think she could. I'm sure that most people can relate to this book in a certain way. I really liked this book and I'd definitely read it again!"
2,GIRLY,I didnt like it . it was too girly. It was not made for guys to read and I wish I didnt. I know its harsh but it is a pink book. Come on not many guys are gonna read a book with flowers actually I dont like reading at all but specially a girl book.
3,average,"this is a really light-hearted book..which finds simple solutions for tough issues..i felt that it tended to gloss over the darker stuff....however, while simplistic, this IS an entertaining bk. and its not entirely stupid. i did learn something from it. its slightly better than the average teen novel, but its far from brilliant. somewhere along the lines of princess diaries i would say."
5,Keeping The Moon,"This is a really great book for many reasons. the first reason is that everyone can relate to the main character because everyone goes through the same things that she does. The second reason is that you start to root for the character to do the right thing.the main character is Colie, a girl who is sent to to live with her unique aunt in Colby while her mom, a fitness guru, is on a european tour. while in colby she gets a job as a watress and makes friends with two other waitresses and the fry cook. each of these people and her aunt help her realize things about herself that she never took the tiem to notice"
4,I love this book!,"Keeping the Moon, by Sarah Dessen is one of the best books I have ever read! I'm sure almost everyone can relate to Colie and her feelings of being an outsider. This book was so encouraging to read, because it shows that if you just be yourself, lip ring and all, people will like you for that, and if they don't, they aren't worth it."
4,keeping the moon...,"I absoluty hated the beginning of this book. It probably took me 3 days to start it. But once I got into it I loved it! It was a really good book, and I LOVE Sarah Dessen. I've read most of her other books, and loved them too! This is a great read, besides the bad beginning!"
5,Everyone has a Beauty Waiting to be Seen,"Fifteen year old Colie believes she is going to have to spend the worst, most depressing summer of her life at her spontaneous, fairly odd Aunt Mira's house while her mother tours Europe doing her weightloss aerobics. How wrong was she.Colie and her mother Kiki have recently lost very much weight after being teased and taunted by , in my opinion, the worthless souls around them. Those memories haunt her day after day, even while she is fifty pounds lighter and spending a summer at her Aunt Mira's house. She meets unforgettable friends, Isabelle, Morgan, and Norman. They, even without knowing it themselves, touch her heart more than she could ever imagine.This novel was deep and really casued me to think. I believe Sarah Dessen is now my favorite author, and I highly reccomend this to any girl who has not completely found herself. I enjoyed this book very much and I hope you will too!"
3,Colie's Summer,"Colie has never fit in with kids her age even after she lost weight and her mom became Kiki Sparks. For a summer she is forced to stay with her eccentric aunt Mira. Colie doesn't expect to make friends in North Carolina, but by some chance she gets a job at the ""Last Chance Bar and Grill"". With Morgan and Isabel working with her they show her that she can be comfortable with herself and how she can show her confidence. She also finds even though those who already knew her aren't going to change their views her new friends see her for who she is.I really enjoyed this book. For how long I have been reading Young Adult Literature it's not very often that I find a topic dealing with how weight loss can affect a person and those she goes to school with. This is the first book I have read from Sarah Dessen, but I would read more books written by her."
4,Friendships and Friends,"One girl struggles at making friends. Colie is this one girl; she has no friends until her mom sends her to her fat aunt Mari. Then she starts a new beginning.Colie's mom is a fitness woman on TV. Colie does not really fit in where she used to live, but for the summer she is not where she normally lives. Morgan, Norman, and Isabelle all work together in a dining facility. Norman lives next door from Mari. Colie is gaining friendship between all these people. This novel has friendship, passion, drama, and plenty more.This novel grabbed me and pulled me in. Friends are the key to life; this is what the novel has shown me. It will change your prospective of a friend and friendship.-Shaina Lyon"
5,My favorite book,"I am 15, the same as Colie, but I first read this book when I was about 10 or 11. It's a book that I've read over and over again and can never seem to put down. It's your classic coming-of-age story, about learning to love yourself (and blah blah) but more importantly, it doesn't chastise you about that. It's witty and clever and it's one I'll always read...even when I get older and become an expert at analyzing literature."
5,"Damn, This Was Good","This book had a realy nice light-hearted feeling to it. It was written so realisticly (well, except for the part where Colie's mom is an international super-star). I bet you are tired of reading those sad, depressing, ""downward spiral"" teenage books. You might think that this book is one of those, being that the main character used to be fat and teased a lot. But it's not. It's actually a great pick-me-up. So read it for god's sake!"
2,keeping the moon,"When i read the book i thought it was really boring, i couldn't wait til i was done with it so i could move on. It was a book a lot of girls could relate to, but i thought it was poorly written."
2,keeping the moon,i order this product at least a month ago and still haven't got it yet. mostlikely won't buy from these people again.
3,Keeping My Interest...,"Hmm, what to say about this... First of all, this really was a good book, but I can't give it 5 stars, or 4 for that matter, because it just didn't WOW me. It's kind of hard to explain but basically this book just isn't my 'type'. The whole thing was pretty boring all the way up until the last three or four chapters. Keeping the Moon is about a 15 year old girl who is sent to live with her Aunt while her mother is touring the world with her famous fitness company. Colie struggles to fit in and forget her haunting past of being overweight. Throughout the story, Colie learns a lot about life and what is important to her. I say if you enjoy stories with no tragedies and a good love-filled, happily ever after ending, then you will love this story."
3,Disappointing....,"I had just finished Dessen's ""The Truth About Forever,"" one of the best books I have ever read, and thought this one would be equally wonderful. I was disappointed. The plot is weak, the characters are weak, everything about this book is weak and boring. It wasn't an overall failure, just a lot less than I expected. It's strange to think it was written by the same author as ""The Truth About Forever"" and ""This Lullaby,"" both outstanding books, when this one is so much the opposite."
4,Great,This book shows what some teens actually go through. Having peer pressure on them and not having self confidence in themselves. Colie used to be fat and she's trying to figure out what to do in life. an excellent read.
1,Keeping the Moon,"Bad Bad Bad business. I'm sure it's illegal to publish a book titled ""Keep the Moon"" and publish a book titled ""Last Chance"", which is the SAME read, yet Sarah Dessen sales them as two different books. What a RIP-OFF! I purchased these two books for my granddaughter, to find they are the same book!"
5,I love this!,"okay. keeping the moon gave me a real since of reality.this book actually shows u how women can really be with out reallly noticing it!Are class Acually meet Mrs.Dessen, and i understand what she was trying to say. it makes perfect since.i think that colie was a perfect person to be in this story and i really loved this book.i would read more books by this author.so 5 stars"
2,Keeping the Moon,"this book is about 15 year old Nicole Spraks (Colie) she is sent to her aunt Mira's house for the summer becasue her mom Ki-Ki Sparks, fitness star, is on tour for the summer. Both Nicole and her mom use to be over weight, but now slim Nicole still has no confadence. with the help of to waitress's she meets, Isabel and Morgan, she finds that it doesn't matter what you look like, just take care of your slef.I found this book to be dull and boring at times. i dont recomend it."
5,Keeping The Moon,"""Keeping The Moon"" was one of the best books I have read so far. I really thought it was something most all teen girls could not only enjoy, but relate to. This book is funny,happy,and in some parts really sad. The main character Colie, is a girl with little self confidence, and no friends. That all changes after spending one summer with her Aunt Mira. Colie meets three people (Isabel,Morgan,and Norman) who change her whole perspective on herself,and life in general. I highly recommend this book to teen girls everywhere. You won't regret reading it :0)"
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,Lyndon LaRouche is insain...he is a convicted felon and yet still manages to convince many progressive-minded young people to throw away their lives and donate their time and money to him.
4,fuel pump,"So far so good,easy to install(did it in my driveway in about 2 hrs)was smaller than original but installed in same location.No cutting or spliceing of wires,came with an electrical adapter.Small rubber hose and 2 hose clamps connect fuel line and pump.Would definetly buy again."
5,Master Force!!!!,grew up watching this every sat. now i got it in my collection. would recommend it if your a transformers fan!
2,super cheap masterforce,"First off let me say that im a die hard, i have owned everything that the g1 transformers have released from beta to bluray! That said I am extremely disappointed with this and the headmasters dvds, I know this is a japan product but how hard would it have been to include the half decent english audio that has been on every cheap bootleg released?? I can not enjoy the animation trying to read, not to mention that the japenease music just ruins the vibe of the show competelly. Its a shame shout took a cheap way out! Save your money on this, go to ebay and buy all 3 imported transformers series for less then 40 bucks with ENGLISH!!!"
3,Good product,"The product stands up to its brand name.Cant give much of a review about this because I use only the VGA port to coonect laptop to TV. I really couldnt figure out how to use the other ports like the USB and stereo ports. There is no manual for this and I hate to sit googling for ""How Tos"" on using all the ports of this cable.I'm happy with I bought for. One of my good investments."
5,italian Garden architecture,"This is a beautifully illustrated book depicting an ancient villa near Siena, Italy, which was restored before the second world war. An Italian aristocrat married a wealthy Anglo/ American woman who was acquainted with an English landscape architct and the three of them created gardens that we now consider classic formal italian landscaping. The woman kept a diary of the work on the gardens and villa and the second world war coming into the estate, published as "" War in Val d'Orcia"". Invaluable records."
3,Weird,"Looking for one of the weirdest videos ever??? Then you've found it. Pure random kaos with the Monkeys and the famous Mickey Mouse club girl. There's really no way to describe this video. There's no plot, no story line, there's really no point to this movie. It's a bunch of random nonsense, but amusing at that. It leaves you wondering what the heck is going to happen next. Could make for an interesting drinking game. There's really no other movie to compare this to. It's interesting and worth watching at least once."
4,Slips A Lot But Is Decent,This rug slips and slides around a lot on anything but carpet. I had to put sticky things on the bottom to stop it. I have had no problem cleaning it and it dries in the same amount of time as a normal rug.
4,...gem,I had never heard of these guys and only had the covers to go by when I bought it. It's a satisfyingly diverse album of laid back drum and bass acid jazz. It seems to draw from a mix of influences and a contains a variety of styles and instruments. Not bad ....
3,"Same as the old edtion, little fort detail","This is basically an updated version, but is mainly a history with little description of the various types of fortifications that made up the great German defensive barrier."
3,Love MCR,"But, and this is a big but, I don't love the way this product came. It was wet. The art work inside was ruin.But this is my second time buying this CD/DVD set because the first one got stolen from my locker at the gym.It's an amazing album."
1,Where is it?,"Ive called every cd store in Chicago and none of them had even heard about this anticipted album ""life on the murder scene"" where is it and where can i get it and when can i get it? Is the only place we can get it is on Amazon.com? this is so screwed up!"
1,Where's the rock?,"This is possibly the worst group of songs from possibly the worst band ever created. I'd rather shove a pushpin into my cornea and pull by eyeballs out than listen to this so called rock music. If your going to listen to this music don't dare tell me that you like Zeppelin and AC/DC at the same time. There is no way in hell that you could possibly enjoy the two most polar opposites of the rock genre. This is like being friends with God, and Satin at the same time, NOT GONNA HAPPEN. My ears are bleeding as we speak for just listening to the first 7.89 seconds of the album. Take this review into advisement when your even thinking about buying material from this ""band.""REXER ROX MY SOX!!!"
5,Freaking AWSOME!!!,"I LOVE this dvd/Cd, I went and bought it the day it came out and I havn't stopped watching it. they have everything from before the major record when they were with eyeball records till now. it's great! there are little snippits of new music for their new record...hopfully. they portrey everything so well ""From Sky high to rock bottom"" it was awsome. if you are a huge fan or even if your just getting to know the genius band, it's a must have for everyone. you'll love it!"
5,Hell yeah!,"If you love this band you will love this dvd. Its freakin awesome, you come to know everything about the band and them telling you the story not anybody else. I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,*WARNING* You CANNOT play this on your DVD player,This is NOT a DVD. THese are mini UMD disks and you will have to buy a PSP (roughly $200) in order to watch this !!!I did not discover this until it was too late and I'd already opened the box.The band must've made some exclusive deal with Sony.
1,Very Dissappointing,"This is NOT A DVD ... everything on the page said ""great DVD"", but in reality, if you do not have a PSP, you can not watch this video. I was very dissappointed!"
2,Not recommended,"I bought this album the day after it was released and was expecting it to be great, but i was dissapointed. The video diary was very good but not the rest. It doesn't even have all the music videos.The live performances aren't too good either."
4,A nice addition to the collection,"To start, I've read all the reviews, and laugh at the people who say ""You can't like this and like that."" Guess what, the very fact you're trying to tell people what they can and can't like is stupid.Getting back to the point of the reviews, MCR has a style that is kinda hard to classify from time to time. Their style changes depending on the message, but the same basic message of being yourself is always there. I'd have to say they're better Live than not, but overall it's all good. I recommend this group and this CD to anyone who has an open appriciation of music and isn't too picky to hate something in the first few minutes."
3,i solved it!!!!!,"Alright everyone I solved the problem!!!! Go on www.mtv.com and go to MCR's artist page. There's a news article titled ""My Chemical Romance Plot 'Murder' for Early Next Year"". Apparently it was supposed to come out around now but Reprise isn't finished with the DVD yet. So hold your horses everyone....it's coming (eventually). And, yes, the customer image is the actual cover. Personally, I like the drawing a lot better :)."
4,A Noble Effort,"Broadway is most known for its upbeat showtunes, finding the terrific ones shouldn't be too hard right? Well kind of. The best songs on this album were the ones I had never heard of - I had no idea Lucille Ball was on Broadway, other than her movie attempt in ""Auntie Mame"", but her song ""Hey, Look Me Over!"" is one of the best on the album. Liza Minelli's Broadway debut song, ""Sing Happy"" is another winner, along with Grand Hotel: The Musical's ""H-A-P-P-Y/We'll Take A Glass Together"". I think though, that if I hear Oliver's ""Consider Yourself"" one more time I'll have to hurt someone. I give it a 4 stars, but I think they got lucky - the songs are good but none of them truely memorable."
3,Decent ending with a twist,This disc ends the show and while I thought I knew how everything was going to turn out I was surprised. It was an ok end to a decent series.
4,A very good resource,"This is a very good general resource for the airpower enthusiast. It covers ALL military air arms all the way down to tiny countries that may own only a few aircraft. ""Open"" countries like most in the West are covered quite well, often down to squadron-level details of what aircraft they fly, how many, and from what bases. Air arms for the different branches of service (navy, army, etc.) are often covered separately. ""Closed"" countries like North Korea and Iraq are covered more generally, often with a simple list of the estimated types and numbers of aircraft. A very nice feature is that each entry includes a map showing the locations of airbases.If you're looking for details about the aircraft themselves, this is not the resource you want. This reference will include the specific versions of each aircraft in use by a particular user, but that is about as detailed as it gets. Also, this was published in 1999, so hopefully there will be an updated edition in the next few years."
1,18 months and no longer works,"Like other users have experienced, this unit is no longer functional after 18 months. The wired base is still working but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights. Poor product Netgear!"
1,No support from Manufacturer,"I've had three of these units. You would think I'd learn! The first crapped out and customer support was not responsive. The second worked intermittently and would disconnect without notice or reason. The third won't allow iPod or iPad to connect and won't allow printing to one printer from a PC but OK to another wireless printer. Many requests for help from manufacturer, even offered to pay shipping both ways to send product for evaluation or repair, were ignored. Never got an answer. No more NetGear for me!"
1,Don't buy it unless you are a computer geek,"It's impossible to install it! After searching the internet forums, I did follow some instructions and it worked in Windows XP once. Then, it stopped working again. Could never install it in Windows 7 and couldn't find any support on the internet. Really, a big headache and money down the toilet. I don't recommend it unless you are a computer geek and like challenges."
1,defective still no refund,"Hooked bridge up to my router then extender to the room I need internet and room was still dead area. Sent it back for refund and it has been over almost a month without any response from seller or Amazon, I had to email Amazon and was told seller has 6 months to refund money. Product was sent in a timely manner is the only positive thing I can say"
2,Dead,"It worked nicely for awhile but as expected it died, took just 8 months. I've plugged in my back up unit but I think it's time to look for a different powerline unit"
1,Didn't work with my LinkSys wireless router,I couldn't get this product to work with my existing equipment. The Netgear extender had a default IP address of 192.168.0.101. Linksys routers serve IP addresses in the 192.168.1.x range. I couldn't get beyond this incompatibility. My search of the Internet for a solution only found more people reporting the same problem. I finally returned the Netgear extender for an equivalent Linksys product which I had no problem getting to work.
1,WGX102 Prone to Hardware Failure,"I purchased a WGX102 about 18 months ago. The first unit I purchased failed after a few months. NetGear replaced it, because it was under warranty. The replacement unit worked nicely for about 15 months, then it failed too, with pretty much the same symptoms. The unit only has a one year warranty, so NetGear told me I would have to buy another. I'm not going to do that, because the units don't seem to last, and I don't want to have to buy another one every 18 months or so.I've seen a number of reviews on various sites by other customers who have had the same experience. Be warned."
4,Netgear,I recently purchased the Netgear wireless range extender system. It was truely plug and play. I didn't have to do anything other than plug it in and start using it.Excellent job.
1,Not Worth The Money,"I bought my unit in February, 2006. It no longer works. Simply put, it does what others have said--breaks down after about 15 months. Mine just died a day or two ago. I have little hope that Netgear will do anything to replace it. I now have to look for another solution for extending the range of my wireless system. I'll keep looking, you should too.Let the buyer beware!"
3,Far better than the CNET review,"I wanted my old windows 98SE computer at the other end of my 5000 sq. ft. house to be wirelessly connected so I wouldn't need to keep switching telephone modem plugs depending on which PC needed internet access. My Netgear WGT624 sent out just enough signal but the 98SE connection would fail as soon as the main PC was accessing the internet, too. I went through several different set up hassles with other routers and antennas - nothing worked.I got this range extender expecting the worst since the outlet I would use is about 75 feet away. I followed the simple directions - Plug ethernet cord into router and the ethernet bridge. Plug bridge into wall outlet. Restart computer. Plug range extender into room where internet access is desired. Wait one minute. Well, wait more like 15 seconds and the 3 lights went on. I turned on the windows 98Se computer and I had a connection speed of 54 mbps - just like that - contrary to what CNET says.Amazing - worth every dollar."
5,Simple and Easy,Just plug it in and it works great -- none of the extenders with an antenna worked as well. Range of the WGX102 is not large but it's easy to move from one electric socket to another so it's easy to get a strong signal wherever you are.
1,"Worked poorly, then broke!","This thing was a major hassle from the start. Difficult to set up (even for an experienced computer user like me). Once it was set up, it took about 5 minutes to get an IP address every time I connected to it. For the non-tech savvy, that means I would turn on my computer, connect to the network, then wait 5 minutes to be able to go online, even though I was laready fully connected to the device. That level of terrible performance is simply unacceptable.Then, about 4 months after I bought it, it up and broke.Don't waste your money on this terrible, terrible piece of equipment."
4,"Improved my posture, not too uncomfortable","This posture garment helped my back, but can sometimes be a little uncomfortable -- it tugs on my shoulders at times. It's well made and reasonably priced. It washes up well, but don't put it in the dryer."
5,Nothin' like 'em 'round here.,"I never knew how grand the bakeries of Paris where until I read Boulangerie! I wish we had a similar tradition in my home town. I love bread and soup above all other foods! Some day, when I visit Paris, I'll search the city with a copy of this pocket guide in my hand.I also enjoyed the pictures of the boulangeries of Paris on the authors Web site: Dorseybooks.com"
3,Headrest Monitor,It does work as advertised but it I wish it was a little more stable. It doesnt hold my monitors upright all the time.
4,So far so good!,"I bought this product recently and tried couple of time, so far it is working fine cleaning carpets well. I was expecting it little light as mentioned in product description but overall it is pretty good."
3,"If you look for an attachment, this is NOT for you","I bought this at a great price, but it doesn't work for us as it does NOT come with the attachment that you needed to clean the many stairs that we have. Amazon has great service, so we easily returned it."
4,Good for the Value,I had an older version of this product with just a fixed brush. This product has a power brush and does an excellent job. We have a second home and we use an expensive Hoover Steamer at that location. This product does just as good of a job and it is more than half the price.
5,Great Little Cleaner,"I bought this unit when it was offered as a Gold Box Deal for $59.99. I figured, at that price, I couldn't really go wrong - which turned out to be correct. Of course, it's not really a true steamer, but at this price, that's a little much to expect. However, the warm water and solution do an excellent job of cleaning my wool area rugs and my three rooms of carpeting - as evidenced by the dirty water extracted. It was super easy to assemble and very easy to use and clean afterwards - which means I use it a lot more often than I would something more complicated and heavy. All in all, I am very happy with this little unit. It does exactly what it said it would and the price was great."
4,Great for light clean up!,"Got this little steamer for $59 with free delivery! Very easy to use, although you do have to read the instructions carefully. It came with a small bottle of carpet shampoo, but no tools.WE used it twice so far for the living room carpet which gets lots of use from our 2 year old. With the provided l""ight duty"" cleaning solution, it took out minor stains and freshened upo the room very nicely. I think with some added vinegar one can clean even old stains better.Light, easy to use and great for periodic clean ups. The carpet was not even wet after an hour. Overall a good product for a very good price."
1,it sucks,"I don't know why in one day this item was rated the top 1 for all vacuums in Amazon. Then I bought it. After using it, I found it does nothing except making my carpet wet."
3,Not one of her best,"I've enjoyed all of this author's books that I've read but, wasn't too jazzed about this one. The plot idea was good but I too figured out who the culprit was about half way through the book.The characters were not well-developed. Because of the fact that we didn't get enough background, it was not easy to figure out their motivations for the things they did.Jack's attitude toward Maggie was arrogant & self-centered. She was good enough for him to have sex with, but not good enough to have anything more with because she was an alcoholic. Who by the way hadn't had a drink in almost ten years and during that time gone to law school and had a thriving practice. I realize his mother was an alcoholic but his mother NEVER stopped drinking! And it's not like he was perfect!"
2,Subject Matter too Dark and stressful to enjoy,"This book was a disappointment as someone looking for an easy romance. Its nothing like the Hawk's Way series and, to my mind, I read for enjoyment and stress reduction. Reading about dead children, brain damaged children, a cold blooded murderer without a conscious, a drowning and comatose child, and alcoholism is just not my idea of a relaxing read. And what happened to the breathtaking romance Joan Johnston created in prior novels? You will not find it here. I say skip this one in favor of the Hawk's Way novels if you are seeking a romance read."
3,HMB,"I did notice a little less soreness, but nothing like what other reviewers stated. Not an overly expensive product, and I will probably try it again. Difference maker? N"
4,Great way to keep metabolism high.,I have ordered this product several times now. It is a great fat burner and keep my metabolism high for a longer period of time after workout. It doesn't work well if you don't work out hard.
4,Great product,"Great product. I looked for a product like this. You get one dose in one pill. The pill size is the only negative, so if you have trouble with larger pills this product may not be for you."
4,Pretty good,"This supplement work pretty good in helping increase lean mass, I did an expirment and did not take this a few weeks and notice my fat burning was not doing as a good job without this suppplement, , so for best value go with this, for best hmb supplement I have personally tried go with the eas version, they used to call it betagen but I belive it has new name for it, the eas has hmb and creatine so thus of course should work better"
3,"Good product, poor price","I bought this about a year ago for $23 on here. I'm not really a supplement junkie, and the only supplement I use consistently is protein powder. That said, I did enjoy using HMB. I took 2-3 caps per day and noticed some nice mass gains in my arms. The gains weren't anything amazing but definitely noticeable, and for $23, it was a great deal. Now that ON decided to raise the price, though, I would hardly say this product is worth it. Unless you have money to throw around, I would definitely look for a better deal. I think bodybuilding.com has a cheaper HMB product, which is what I will probably purchase instead. Overall nice product, just not worth the price."
4,SOME SIDE EFFECTS,i fell my throught sore some times and i do get thouse rashes form the side effects but i can live whith it.i have read that it works well with createen.
1,Watch out for side effects,"My experience with this product was very bad. I developed a persistent allergic reaction with swollen skin and itchy rash on my thighs, waist and shoulders. Contrary to another reviewer's coment, there is plenty of information about HMB side effects: Breathing problems; or tightness in your throat or chest; Chest pain; Skin hives, rash, or itchy or swollen skin. There was no noticeable benefit. Your 'mileage' may vary, but use with caution!"
2,Noticeable Results: Not Really,"I did not expect any type of pump or energy boost, but there was not a significant, noticeable effect from using one bottle of this product.I was expecting to see my muscles get harder at the end of this cycle. While I gained 2 pounds and reduced my body fat by about 1%, I cannot say it was directly related to the use of this product.My opinion: This product is for professional bodybuilders and not really for the avid lifter like me. I will not purchase this product again."
5,disco great,GREAT PRODUCTS MY WIFES 70'S PARTY WAS GREAT DIDNT END TILL 430AM & BALL RAN THE WHOLE TIME WITHOUT A PROBLEM
3,Cool kit but lights didn't last long,I installed this kit on my back patio under the roof structure so it's out of the elements. It's been up for 4-5 months. After about 1-2 months the lights stopped working. The bulbs have burned out. We run the lights most nights for 1-4 hours. So maybe that is the lifetime of the bulb...i don't know. Replacement bulbs are available for $4-5. I haven't replaced them yet...hoping that's all it is. When it does work it lights up the whole yard (good size yard) and it's supercool.
1,"Poor CD quality. skips, very disappointed","Seller probably did not know that this CD is a second cuz it skips and sticks on various songs. Wish they would replace it with a ""good"" one that is not damaged."
3,Not quite what I'd hoped...,Still great music from a great artist.I'm happy Michael is once again a part of the Gaither Vocal Band.
3,"Good disc, but the Broadway cast is better.","Ruthie Henshall and Kirby Ward are the leads in this London production of CRAZY FOR YOU, and if anything they are better than their Broadway counterparts. The rest of the cast, however, isn't quite as good although not bad. The recording has a flat, dry sound unlike the open, spacious, stereo sound of the Broadway disk. The packaging has a detailed synopis and libretto. The Broadway disc is a little longer (70:48, vs. 65:58 for the London cast) and includes the title song which has been eliminated from the London cast disc. For these reasons, the Broadway disc is preferred."
5,Clear summer night-no work tomorrow-Lets just sit right here,"Wow!! What a wonderful group AAS are. Gorgeous music that blends so well ya forget there is soo much going on at times--- soft instruments/vocals just gliding over each other. This music has an odd effect of calming my mind and energizing my spirit. I had the good fortune of seeing AAS on the last night of their tour. As a whole they looked as bad as they smelled----Ahhh, but the music!!! They pulled off every luscious note,-crystal clean. They could of played all night. You have shows and you have experiences. They were an experience beyond simple music."
2,Not what Stanley used to be . . .,"This chisel is great if you're a DIYer who's looking for something to make corner cuts in plywood, square up lock mortices and the like. The steel cap it nice and a necessity because it you don't wack it with a hammer, its not going to cut anything. The steel doesn't take or hold a sharp edge well, hence the steel cap. I use/abuse mine for rough cutting but these should not be used to shave that 1/32 off a board to get it to fit or to do any sort of fine woodworking."
5,The best band no one's heard of...,"No, they're not that obscure, but TAAS lies far beyond the mainstream. I cannot think of another band with such deep compositional strength. There aren't any riffs that stand on their own, but everything taken together is pure brilliance in timing and subtle interwoven melody. On a simple level, it's just damn good chill music and something I'm always happy to put on at the end of the evening or first thing in the morning.Know By Heart is probably the most consistent album, start to finish, and is filled with greatness. I always play that for newbies first. But this album has some of the greatest gems in their library. Gone to Earth is a work of art and will probably go down in my top 10 songs of all time. It has so many wonderful pieces to it, it alone is worth the price of the album (though there is plenty else to be admired).Get this and Know By Heart and say hello to your new favorite band."
4,"Dreamy, Minimalist, Bedtime Melodies","I saw AAS at South by Southwest back in '97 or '98 and was enthralled by their deliberately paced electronic music. Having had already listened to the CD a few times prior to their show it was a pleasure to see and meet them (they couldn't have been nicer!). For months this is what I fell asleep to, which doesn't mean it bores you to death, but rather that it is mellow, dreamy music completely stripped down and totally hypnotic. Start here with their first album and then see how they have progressed."
4,Fine arrows for beginners,These are not the $150 per dozen arrows. These arrows are meant for the archery novice. They can take the punishment of missing the target and getting buried into the ground or hitting the target's wood frame. The fletches are plastic not feather and that is perfect for the beginner. These are inexpensive arrows that can be knocked around.
3,"Nice and light, pretty accurate but tips damage if your not careful",Fly very straight and are easy to learn on but the tips are pressed and flatten if you hit a tree or rock. I have also had a tip come off another. I had to file the nock open to fit my 25lb bow but that was my fault for getting a heavier string.When I get better I would consider these again but not until my aim improves
1,nocks were too tight!,"I don't know why, but the nocks were all very tight on my string. Had to return them. Besides the nocks, they looked to be in good quality."
4,Horray for St Patricks Day,My children ages 6 and 3 really enjoyed this book. they really got a kick out of the flaps that you lift up and see whats under it.
3,yes and no,Daughter enjoys finding the hidden leprechauns on each page and lifting flaps. Wished story was a little longer.
3,Too Late Baby,"Book was ordered in plenty of time to receive, wrap and send out as a gift - or so I thought.I selected a seller with a state location right next to mine.I thought that would speed up the process. The book arrived long after the holiday, so now it's packed away for next year!One positive - for a new book, the price was right (slight crease on back cover, however.)"
4,Great Value,"These par cans are constructed out of powder-coated aluminum, and seem to be good quality. They use standard gel sheets, but I found that I had to cut down the 7"" gel sheets a little so they could fit. The bulbs that come with them are 150W. They are okay, but seem cheaply made. The light coming off of the bulb is uneven, so you may want to buy diffuser sheets or use a different bulb if this bothers you. I ended up buying 6 sets of these (12 total), so I am obviously pleased with this product."
2,These are not pin spots...,"Other reviewers seemed to indicate that these lights would work with a mirror ball; nothing could be further from the truth. They broadcast light throughout the room; the included flood light isn't special, either - The light it projects is not even, with hot spots throughout the range.Get these only if you are trying to light up a large area / room."
2,Extremely HOT,"You cannot run one of these for any longer then 15 minutes without having to worry about it burning the outlet it's plugged into. The shell also reaches temperatures hot enough to burn you if touched. Since realizing this I've discontinued the use of them.Though, they are extremely bright, and simply designed.Beware : These do not come with color shields, nor clamps. They must be purchased aside from this individually."
3,The cheapest thing that can work,"These are basically just lightweight receptacles for the lamp and the gel. Simple zipcord two prong power. The Chauvet models are much more professional grade, but these are cheap and do the job I suppose. The lamps (bulbs) have a poor stippley dispersion which is common, but it's just a PAR38 Medium base and you can get plenty of alternates."
5,The American DJ Par 38B can flood light get 's the job done.,"The American DJ Par 38B can flood light get 's the job done. There are a range of bulbs that work with these floods, and it was within my budget!"
2,Not what I expected,The description was what I was looking for. The lights were nothing like the description and one of them even was defective. They really are just a light source not the directional spot that I wanted. They went back.
5,Right on target,Bought these crimpers for my dad. He being an old new englander was grumbling to me about how he needed to find a way to install his new wood stove in the basement but couldn't find a pipe with two male ends. Amazon to the rescue! These crimpers stopped his grumbling and even earned a positive review from my grumpy old man.
1,Bad music,"This cd has many songs that maybe a few people would be interested but overall this is a terrible cd. Many other, better music cds can be found, besides this. ""Get away"" is pretty good, if only I could find a cd with only that on it. Its just a warning. there are plenty of other better cds than this."
4,I agree with Adrian,"This is cd is a must for any hardcore freestyle freak out there.One tune in particular absolutely kills and that's ""Destiny"" by my boy ROCCO. This cat's sick bomb is produced by one Florida's all time best hitmakers, ""G.T."" This dude back in the day, drop the beats and hooks like nobody in the biz. He put together other sexy tunes like ""not a second time"" and ""another night"".Ya wanna get stroked, drop these goodies on your 12's, you're gonna luv it!!Enjoy . . . Mykey"
2,Can't say they didn't warn you...,"I like bad horror movies, so the title alone sold me on this one. It definitely was the worst, or maybe tied with Geek Maggot Bingo...but bingo is alot funnier (intentionially)It was obviously made by a bunch of Jersey/New York 80's metalheads who never grew up...I'm also one of those people and I still didn't get through it. I fell asleep just after the turd-demon scene. In fact, we all fell asleep...I woke up after the disc ran out to the sound of 3 people snoring. Seriously."
3,Lets Face It! The Title Saids It All!!!,"Who could resist such a title? When I Saw this in the store I saw it more as a challenge, a gaunlet, dare if you will. It IS the sickest and most depraved thing I have EVER seen. I couldn't believe the truly tackiness of this venture, but on a certain level, it still manages to entertain because you have NO idea where this film is going to go...and how far. This is not for the faint of heart, the squimish, or anyone who enjoyed the movie ""The English Patient."" It is sick, even by John Waters standards. OK boys and girls you have been warned...now watch if you dare."
1,Low Grade Crap,"Had to shut this off after 10 minutes, Shot with a camcorder and the special effects are cheesy computer effects, that look like they were made from a computer from the 1980's. Crap like this gives horror movies a bad name. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,"Great, but I wanted so much more!","A beautifully constucted book for as far as it goes, but we Sister Wendy lovers are left wanting more! If anything, it seems too small in scale. Like a delicious meal that we're only allowed to take a couple bites of. This is actually a great thumbnail introduction to saints for all us non-Catholics. The usual great paintings with Sister Wendy's wonderful, insightful commentaries. But we wish for bigger visual and literary feast. Everything about the book is small scale. Some of the illustrations should have been blown up to a larger size. We wish Sister Wendy would have gone on longer in her commentaries. At 93 pages, we wish for at least 100 more. She shouldn't have limited her selections to paintings from just one Italian exhibition. For all its brevity, I highly recommend the book. Lasty, don't pass up any chance to snag a copy of the video version of this book which aired on PBS."
4,Genealogy resource for Lawrence Co Indiana,"This is a wonderful book written in 1984 by Gloria Brewer Jones of Plano TX. It has information on many of the Lawrence and Monroe Families including Brewer, Hawkins, McKnight, McPike, Ragsdale, Norman, Meadows, Browning and others. It includes many pieces of information not commonly found in other books like copies of obituaries, pictures, copies of wills and other sources on these families. It is a true treasure. It is hard bound with a black cloth binding published by Gatwway Press, Inc of Baltimore."
3,Something Even the Grandchildren will Enjoy,"This is a terrific Chrismas record that the whole family can enjoy. It is done in the traditional way that we are used to from Sinatra, Bennet to Crosby. My grandchildren especially like this music around the holidays now that they are a little older and in college. Civisca's voice reminds me of Steve Lawrence with his smooth velvety tones. All in All this is a fun record for the holiday season although it does not offer the jazz listener much to think about."
4,good moto,it has a very short charge time which is great. the battery last very long with the bluetooth ear piece.its great stuff.
1,Krzr,"The phone did not get good signal and it did not ring most of the time. I might purchase the phone again, but NEVER will I use this company again, MobileCityOnline. I would not suggest them to anyone. They have very very poor customer service!!"
5,What a great cellphone I've ever got!,It's hard to express how I love this stuff.I've used it for months and keep loving it more and more.Hope more people will love it!
4,Just perfect for us,"It's a great unit for the price. I own and iPod and it's no comparison. But I will tell you it's great for people who don't need more than a simple, easy to use MP3 player. It certainly does all the basic functions my iPod does, plays music, fast forward, skip, replay, shuffle, etc. It has a lock to prevent bumping and shut-offs. It's light, small and lasts LONG time with one AAA battery. The LCD is difficult to read in sunlight."
4,lots of music for little money,It does take awhile to figure out how to actually use it BUT its well worth the effort. I highly recommend it. Its inexpensive has excellent battery life.....
4,Walking grandma,This little gadget delivers a big punch for very little money. The sound is great and it is easy to load directly from your computer. I am quite pleased with it. It is very lightweight and easily carried around my neck (or anywhere).
1,It Worked...At First...,"When i first got the MP3 player it was great, it worked fine and i was very pleased with its battery life. But then only 3 weeks after i bought the product it broke and unfortunately for me i threw away the box and everything that came with it once i thought it was working satisfactorily. Oh well. All i have to say is if given the chance i would NOT have bought the product in the first place, and regret doing so now."
1,worst MP3 I've seen,"First one didn't work, got a replacement - both easy to put music on the device but the music will not play ... very clugy button setup and even the neighborhood tekky kid couldn't get the songs downloaded to play - don't buy this item!"
3,Hard to Use,"It took me weeks to figure out how to use it. I downloaded the disk that came with it, but it was of no help. And I scoured the instructions that came with it with a fine tooth comb, but I still did not get directions for how to use it or how to get songs onto it."
2,Doesn't work with Windows Media Player,"This player doesn't work with Windows Media Player. This player works by dragging files in Windows Explorer so any protected content WMAs will only cause a format error. If you are only playing songs you took off your own CDs then this player should work fine, but if you have any music you've downloaded from a Napster type service then you are out of luck."
5,4 Year Old Loves It!,Wanted something inexpensive for the little one. He loves listening to his own music and can run it without a problem.
3,mixed---,"The manual is written in micro-print and in techno-Chinlish... It never does say how to put music on it - luckily trial and error showed it to just act like a USB thumb drive - IE just copy and paste from windows explorer.Goes through AAA batteries fast, invest in a charger and a couple of rechargeable AAAs.That said it worked and the 12 year recipient loved it.Will fit 12 CD's more or less.The chip technology is SONY which means it is over featured for a youngster. Luckily she is a budding technogeek. MP3 player with several equalizer modes, FM radio, voice recorder and playback - plus extensive setup options of language, color etc etc etc that I did not explore before Santa came."
2,a small point,"Mollin and Williamson is perhaps the most poorly bound paperback I've ever used. Of all the students who purchased the paperback and used it throughout freshman year, I know of perhaps 5 whose book is still intact. The pages start falling out almost as soon as you open the book. If you want to purchase a copy, I suggest you go with the hardbound version. Given the price of the book, this alone is enough to merit a low rating. The text itself is satisfactory,; a bit confused at times, and with an insufficient lexicon, but altogether fairly easy to use and understand."
1,Nice looks but hard to read.,It might be my vision but I've never owned a watch in my life so hard to read as this one. Unless you have 20/20 vision don't buy it.
4,good tool,"tool works great, the case is cheap and was already ripped when it arrived at my house. i would definatley recommend this tool"
5,Best Available Software Technical Support Book,"Strong coverage of Escalation, Service Design, Measuring & Metrics, Scheduling, Staffing, Kinds of Support, Surveying Clients, Workflow.Weak/silent on Phone Skills, Call Monitoring, Time Management, Teamwork, Support Systems."
3,Wooden Performances,"Gerhard Oppitz's interpretations of these gems of solo piano music lacks any sense of atmosphere or poetry at all. Take Liszt's Liebestraum No.3 for example. I've never heard such wooden performance of this beautiful music - he articulates every note as if playing Bach or Beethoven and converys no sense of the dreamy, trance-like wistfulness of the music whatsoever. Compare it with Daniel Barenboim's exquisitely sensitive reading on DG, then you know what I mean."
4,Explains Different Views Well,"This book explains four major views of divorce and remarriage within a narrow stream of evangelicalism. Not only are the four views explained, but the authors of opposing viewpoints are allowed to reply and respond. This book will help Christian leaders, particularly those serving as volunteer leaders, determine their position on these issues."
3,Cute,"Great little gift for dog-lovers. Dropped it to 3 stars because the magnet that keeps them together has already come off of one of the dogs (less than a month). No biggie; we'll glue it, but that makes it a 3-star product to me."
3,It's ok,"The cookbook is ok... I enjoyed some of the other books in the series, such as the Provence one. This could be because the French books seem more exotic, i.e. me not being from France and all. The book gets three stars as it has good recipes and poritions, just didn't strike me the same was as others in the series."
2,Review of vendor Vema Electronics,"So far, I'm not impressed with VEMA Electronics, a supplier of computer products through the Amazon store.They do not answer the phone. No greeting at all but you do get unceremoniously dumped into voicemail. No timely return call.Supposedly ""Michael"" is the customer service contact. (425) 894-5142 is the number published.My issue was, and still is, the product I ordered was mis-represented in the product description and photo. As a result, product is not compatable with my PC, causing me delay.I rely on the vendors accurate description and depiction of the product on Amazon as I make go/no-go decisions. While this may be an instance of unintended oversight on their part, it makes no excuse for ignoring customers request for timely remedy."
4,Interesting,Full of interesting off beat information about a group of towns the author visits and rates according to his unique scale. Fun to read especially if you have visited any of the areas.
5,"a nice read, use Google Maps to see actual places","For people looking for a sterile, authoritative writing style, this book is not so good.For those looking for the honest opinion of one man concerning small towns that are fun and rewarding to live in, it's a great read"
2,coast to coast navel-gazing,"Pindell's book is not about visiting a number of places in America and comparing how livable they are. He's already got some ideas about what makes a place livable, and doesn't set out to challenge them in the least. He visits a handful of cities and towns, talks to some people he meets in bars, and moves on. He doesn't consider any large cities. He's mostly interested in how people like him (middle aged, middle class, white collar, married with children) will find the area.As an unmarried, childless person in my 20s, I found this book next to useless."
1,Inaacurate,"I used to live in one of the towns that is discussed in this book. In fact, I was living there at the time the author made his visit(s), and I can honestly say that his research was sloppy at best. Pindell mentions events that never took place, gets the names of town officials and areas in town wrong, and confuses several other facts. If he bungled the job on this one chapter, I can only imagine how inaccurate all the others are."
4,A Good Read,"Well written, an interesting exploration of Americans constant quest for ""a good place to live"". The author takes the reader from West Coast to East with stops in the middle. Recommended"
5,"Scholarly, superbly researched and eminently readable","This book really is a superbly researched work by an author who has a real feel for the subject. It contains in-depth, well researched information which has been succintly put together. Where there is doubt about the authenticity of any source material, this is clearly stated in the text. This book is definitely the best place to start for anyone with an interest in the subject of saints."
4,Indispensable for the Casual Anglo-Saxonist,"Other reviewers have cogently noted Farmer's English bias in his otherwise witty and eminently readable accounts of Saints' lives, but I might add that this fills a necessary niche in a crowded field. English and Welsh saints are lacking in many major references of this kind, and Farmer, publishing under the appropriate Oxford imprint, provides a welcome reprieve from this omission."
5,My new go-to saints reference book.,"Compared to the Delaney Dictionary of Saints (1980) and the Walsh Dictionay (A New Dictionary of Saints East and West), a cursory review of the this Oxford Dictionary by David Farmer leads me to believe it is the best of the three; it is the more inclusive (e.g. the only one of the three with a listing for Saint Rule, who was the custodian of Saint Andrew's relics in the 4th Century.)"
1,Lacking substance,"Holiday for Pans is a CD that has been comprimised since it was written.This CD is patchy at best,with lesser name Bass Players finishing up the CD after Jaco`s death and is NOT AUTHORIZED BY THE PASTORIOUS ESTATE MOST OF THIS CD IS NOT ACTUALLY JACO PLAYING"
3,Controversial unfinished recording by late great bassist.,"Holiday for Pans is unavailable in the United States.This album has a convoluted history made worse by the fact that the upredictable Jaco himself may have traded or sold the unfinished master tapes several times before his untimely death. Relying heavily on the steel pans of Othello Mollineaux, this album is at times darkly compelling. Its sound is definately unique. The opening tune, Mysterious Mountain, really sets a tone that the album doesn't deliver in the end. Still, check out the fabulous version of Coltrane's Giant Steps - have you ever heard this difficult tune played on pans? Unfortunately, the album was never really finished, and there are ""holes"" in some of the pieces where you can just imagine what Jaco might have intended. Still, this album is a must-have for the Jaco freaks and fusion collectors who like obscure expensive import titles."
5,Great quality!,"I spotted this collar at a Petsmart and had to have it for my dog Suzy. I found it on amazon for a MUCH better price and 6 months later, Suzy is still wearing her spike collar with class. I wash the leather with soap and hot water and it doesnt retain any doggy smell!"
5,Stunning effort!,"Poor recording aside, this is one of my all-time favorite discs, it needs to be remastered. ""Eastern Voices"" is one of my favorites and would be a great song on any disc but my favorite and one of my all-time favorite gems is ""Sustain Upright"". ""Sustain Upright"" is one of the most eerily addictive songs I have ever heard and cannot get enough, despite owning this disc for nearly 20 years. State of Mind is very reminiscent of Future Sound of London and can't help but wonder if this disc was a big influence for FSOL. I heartily recommend this disc for any music fan but don't give up on the first couple of listens. Give it several listens to build the synapses and you will be rewarded. If you don't buy then you should definitely download ""Sustain Upright""."
5,State of Mind >,"This is FLA's second album and just like early Delerium, early FLA was much better than the FLA now. This is possibly due to the style of instruments back in the early 1990's but the primitive industrial beats sound good and are not disruptive to listen to like later FLA albums were. I was impressed with the quality of music on show here, the songs flowed smoothely and did not carry on for 7-10 minutes like most FLA songs do these days. The synths mixed well with the industrial aspects of the song and moments of dark gothica fusion melded well with the overall dynamics of the songs. There is also a 'Delerium' influence within a few of these songs most noticably in 'Eastern Voices', 'Landslide' & 'Consequence'.This CD will be played regularly by me as it is a 1 hour escape into the pleasures and fundaments of musical nirvana."
3,80's not there best years,Don't get me wrong i like this FLA album.... but if you listen to the later stuff it's much mere better. One of the things i don't like about this album is must of the songs do not sing in it! im guessing only 3 or 4 songs do have vocials. Im so glad i got this CD in my FLA collecton! this CD is hard to come by these days.
5,Great telling of events,"I received this book today and was extremely satisfied with how it describes the battle. Much more than I anticipated is revealed with the turn of each page. Data tables are precise and maps flawless. Especially interesting was the fact the Tigers of Army Detachment Kempf were unable to reach Prohkorovka to help in the outcome.Also, how strong the Soviet defences were and how minefields took a terrible toll on the panzers and just how costly the campain was to both sides."
2,not a lot of meat,"After receiving my Reiki I attunement, I wanted very much to find a book that cleared up a few remaining questions and also to give me a more comprehensive background on Reiki. I picked up this book but soon found the ""traditional"" in the title to be a little misleading.The information on Reiki's origins is very much the standard myth that was first spread by Hawayo Takata when Reiki was first taught in the United States. It has since been debunked by modern Reiki practitioners who traveled to Japan to get the real story.Overall, I found Amy Rowland's book to contain not much more information than you'd get from your average Reiki I class. This may not mean anything regarding Ms. Rowland as a Reiki teacher, but if you're looking for a more in-depth overview of Reiki's history, practice and spirit, I would recommend ""The Spirit of Reiki,"" by three of the foremost Western Reiki teachers. It also contains many very useful Japanese Reiki techniques."
4,A full-color guide for the traveler,"A well-organized, informative guidebook. Each entry includes most important features, growth structure, leaves, flowers, fruits, occurence, other names, and additional information, illustrated with one or two photos designed to aid in identification. A great deal of data in a small package with, unfortunately, very small print. In addition to the standard categories of trees, palmlike plants, bushes, and climbing plants, there are sections on herbs, crops, epiphytes, and water plants a well. Index. For additional information on a number of these plants, seeOrnamental Plants & Flowers of Tropical Mexico."
2,you get what you pay for,"Good-light-warm-cheapBad-easily torn-not good slippers for summer time-doesnt last long-small if your foot-size is larger than 9Tip for those who have foot-size larger than 9:you can't make this longer(this is long enough no worry),but you can loosen it by stretching its upper part (it will make some sound like tearing apart, but it works anyway)I want to recommand ppl to pay little more to buy better one."
5,Perfect for traveling,"It comes in a resealable plastic. It is about men's size 8, but the open toe accommodates a range of sizes. Cheap enough to dispose after a week's hotel stay, or sturdy enough to use for months."
4,Good Text,"This is a great text for the amount you pay. It's full of great pictures of the brain and was very useful for my neuroanatomy class. The only downside is that the index is not very useful and you have to search through the pages to find specific structures. For a beginner in neuroanatomy, it is annoying, but once you start knowing the structures and the levels they appear, it becomes easier."
3,"Great color, doesn't last so long","I bought Shocking Blue to dye my sister's tips with. The color was really vibrant and it looked great. However, it faded really fast. She didn't wash her hair for a week and after that she used color protecting shampoo and conditioner and it still faded very quickly into a much lighter and duller blue."
5,Manic Panic!,"i've been an avid user of manic panic for 5years,i'm never displeased with the brillant colors for processing time,i leave mine in for 3-6 hours depending on the shade of color i bought,i rinse it with color water and don't use shampoo for 3days though i shower daily i just use conditioner,to keep color mix your extra manic panic in a small bottle with your shampoo,it keeps the color fresh and great looking"
4,:),"I originally bought this product because I wanted to mix it with Splat's blue envy to make a green shade. Turns out, the green was too dark and the dyes wouldn't mix well together because Manic Panic's was too runny. So I wouldn't recommend mixing different brands of hair dyes together lol. Has horrible results.BUTTTT if you want to use it alone, it works pretty well :3 I got tons of compliments on my red/yellow hair!It's great and I'd totally recommend it."
4,Shipped fast,Product shipped quickly and as described. I love the bright vibrant color that stays true for about two weeks without fading.
2,not for darker hair,"This color, electric lizard, does not work on dark brown hair. I've had other panic colors, and they stain perfectly, but this one was a dud. Unless you are going to be under a blacklight, don't bother."
3,It's okay,"The shipping and price were great, but this really won't work unless your bleaches to a VERY VERY light yellow. My hair was a medium yellowish with some orange areas after 2 bleaches, and the manic panic virgin snow had no effect ):"
2,Awful,"Washed out way too quickly. The initial color was really nice, but after a week, it faded into pink. Don't waste your money on this."
3,Neat!!!,"The color was perfect but it didn't leave my hair like I wanted it to be. I wanted it to show on the sun or where the light was but I guess I needed to bleach it first so it would come like I wanted it . on the other hand, the product is great and the color is amazing. c: worth the money !!!"
5,"Great, especially if you want silver hair!","This also acts as a great blonde toner!I've been wanting silvery grey hair for years now and every hair stylist told me that it was impossible because my hair is so dark. Well, finally, I have gotten what I wanted, sort of by accident. I dyed my hair to a pale yellow using Beyond The Zone radical bleach kit (left it on for 90 minutes and my hair didn't fall out), then I conditioned and dried it. Then I mixed about a teaspoon of lie locks with about a cup and a half of conditioner (which made the mixture a lovely pastel blue based purple). I left it on over night, and then left a deep conditioner in my hair for an hour after rinsing it out, and then rinsed that out. The color came out exactly how I had mixed it and my hair felt so soft! I dyed it 3 weeks ago and my hair is still purple( I wash it 3-4 times a week)! It's just a silvery purple, and I love it! Now I'm contemplating dying my whole head this color, it's so lovely."
2,...VERY iffy...,"The product features pretty much lie when they say that the fading is gradual. The first time I washed this it turned my hair downright moldy-looking. Although, this could probably be the fact that it is turquoise. I bought this because when I think turquoise, I think a pretty bluegreen shade. This made me look kinda gross. I found this product very frustrating, and probably would not recommend it to a friend."
2,Pretty But Lasted About 2 Minutes!,"So when you initially dye your hair with this, it's a really pretty lillac. You really need to goop it on too, it's pretty faint. But it comes out very nicely. However, by the next morning, it has already faded considerably. And then you wash it and boom, it's faint to the point of being invisible. I re-dyed it the day after but it didn't hold any better...Recommended only if you're interested incredibley temporary dye. Also, I was only doing 2 - 3 chunks of hair, so get multiples. You have to really slop it on so if you're doing your whole head, you'll definietly need more than 1. It gets 2 stars because I love the color and want it to work!"
2,"Virgin Snow toner didn't damage hair, but didn't work","First off let me say that IN GENERAL I love manic panic. I've used their Vampire Red and After Midnight Blue amongst others with no problem whatsoever.But the Virgin Snow toner just simply did not do ANYTHING, which for over 10 bucks was very frustrating.I made sure my hair was a VERY light blonde, in good enough condition, clean enough, etc-I mean basically I've been dyeing my hair long enough to know what I'm doing-and after washing the stuff out my hair still had the same amount of yellow as before.I'm sure this works fine for some people, and at least it didn't damage my hair.Honestly though I've had more extreme and overall better results so far with using Clairol Shimmer Lights conditioner to tone the yellow out."
2,Decent..,I bought this in the hopes of returning my hair back to jet black (after totally screwing it up...)It didn't work out so well. My hair was jet black for all of a day before it started to fade... now its a rather light black/ dark brown color... Not at all what I was looking for. I prefer Splat's version of jet black.
1,Dyed everything but my hair.,"I have very thin, black hair for starters. I bought the bleach kit, used it, had very pale, brown hair as a result. I used half of the jar of Lie Locks on the small amount of hair I wanted dyed, left it in for over 40 minutes before rinsing it out and all I got was one very pale streak of purple. So then I bleached the hair again, had it VERY light, and tried again with the other half of the jar. Left it in for over 40 minutes again, and even applied heat, but got the same exact results. Just one little streak of pale purple with the rest of the bleached hair simply darkened as if I hardly bleached it at all.Of course everything the dye touched that wasn't my hair is beautiful and brightly colored."
3,Red is pink,"I was looking for a red color, even dark red is ok, but this is more of a magenta-pink. Ive left the dye in overnight to try for a darker color but all I can get is pink. My hair is not bleached but a very light blonde in spots, but because the dye looks so pink I don't think my hair color matters much. The pink color is very pretty, but not red."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,"I was SO disappointed! I had heard great things about this product, bought it, was super happy, then I dyed it! I put plenty in, and followed directions, but it turned out as nothing, but my hair turned darker. I am trying to keep my hair naturally blond as long as I can, but it just made my hair darker and that's all. And for when it does work, I heard it's WAY too light. SO disappointed! If I do buy from them again, I guess a darker color should be used!"
1,made my scalp bright red and burn,"although i did use this after i had dyed my hair with another product, it turned my scalp bright red and made it feel really awful, itching and burning. faded quickly, and when i called manic panic about it the girl just gave me a nasty, snooty attitude"
2,gunk?,"I have never had a problem with Manic Panic before. I love their products. However, even after being left on for about an hour, the change in hair color was barely noticeable. It seems like someone stuffed the container with random blue gunk. Also a little strange that it didnt have any kind of seal..."
3,Not amethyst for me,"I lifted the color from my hair and used this color, but the result was a silver- light blue.I ultimately used Special Effects electric blue for Great results."
2,ROCKABILLY BLUE BLEEDS VERY BADLY!!,"I applied Manic Panic Rockabilly Blue to my teenage daughter's hair. She has had many shades of blue and this one looked like it would be the brightest yet. The color is stunningly blue. HOWEVER, the bleeding is horrendous. Her face, neck, ears, hands, and shoulders are BLUE!! Even after several shampoos, the color continues to bleed out everywhere. We have to spend 30 minutes in the bathroom every morning just cleaning up her face. Then it just returns in an hour, anywhere her hair has touched. I have never experienced anything like this. This product needs to be pulled from the shelves and reformulated to reduce the bleeding. I regret ever using this on my poor daughter. It is her choice to attend middle school in the midwest with blue hair. I commend and respect her bravery and sense of independence. She did not choose to attend middle school with blue skin."
3,great color,"Couldn't find this color at any store where i live, not at a sally or a beauty supply store, great price compared to buying it from the manic panic store online, or in nyc, works great, not permanent but that's what makes it fun!"
5,Amazing,"This color is amazing!! I am mixing in a little with my conditioner every 2 weeks or so to keep my color bright in between permanant dyes. I learned the hard way to rinse it out in my laundry sink instead of in the shower, as it ended up everywhere. I love it."
4,"If you want more than just One color in your hair, this is the dye","The first time I wanted to dye my hair was last year. I used VOL 40 bleach for my medium brown hair and used cotton candy pink. It faded FAST. I left it on for two days and it still faded after 4 days. Okay I wasn't mad because I did go in the pool so the chlorine must have leaked it out.The second time I wanted to get creative so I bought RAW's Sunset Orange and Manic Panic Electric Lava. I used the Lava color for the base and the Orange for the tips.Oh my gosh, Beautiful. It came out just as I imagined. No. Even BETTER than I imagined. I loved it. I dyed my hair over a month ago and i STILL have a bit of the color. It's faded but you can tell it's orangy reddish."
3,Good in the short term,"(There's a picture of my hair in customer images. I'm the one in the red shirt.)My natural hair color is chocolate brown so I bleached the bottom two inches before applying.I had to redye my hair every week to keep it looking good. Otherwise the green would fade to much and my hair would look really gross. I tried everything to extend how long the dye would last. Including:-Washing my hair in cold water-Leaving the dye in for hours-Applying heat while dying-Washing my hair every other dayThese things helped but the dye never lasted more than a week. It looked good the first day, but rapidly faded.If you're dying your hair for a night at the club or a high school football game Manic Panic might be good. However if you are looking for long term results I would recommend using a more permanent dye."
2,didnt work,This product didnt work wth just one application. Where it did it was nice but my hair half looked yellow n the white so maybe i didnt do it right but it looked ridiculous on me anyway lol.
1,virgin snow and 40 vol amplified bleach kit,Would not recommended either of these products. Makes ur hair turn yellow and ugly. Fried my hair also>:/ 1 star for sure!!
2,Rockabilly Blue Nightmare!,"So I did not search for reviews of Rockabilly blue before I bought it and never thought I would have such a horrible experience dying my hair!! I did as I usually do with hair dye and applied it generously, using about 75% of the bottle. It got everywhere, I turn blue every time I step in the shower and I even turn blue when I try to do my hair. I CANNOT TOUCH MY HEAD WITHOUT STAINING MY HANDS. I dyed my hair on Tuesday. It's still like this after several showers. I honestly don't know what to do anymore and when I found out I wasn't the only one who was having this problem, I was relieved. I have to sleep with an old t-shirt over my pillow so it won't stain. Next time when I use Manic Panic I will stick to using Atomic Turquoise because I've never had any problems with that on. I gave this a 2 because although it's a nightmare, the blue is amazing."
2,Doesn't work all that great on dark hair.,"Does give some highlights and will not do much damage to hair, but the color could be a little more noticeable. I tend to get more compliments when I use Jerome Russell on my hair. His color is more noticeable though he rinses out fast too. Manic Panic just isn't strong enough for my hair I guess."
2,Too light,"I have blonde hair -- a combination of medium blonde and light blonde. I dyed some of my hair with this, and it didn't take very much at all -- if your hair is bleached blonde, then this would work. Otherwise, opt for a darker colour."
1,Terrible!,"This was a waste of time and money!A lot of people said that you could use it on unbleached hair, it is a LIE! I tried to use it on my black hair and it didn't show any change. Then I bleached my hair and when I tried to dye my hair with the after midnight blue dye it turned in to a greenish blue! Also a friend of mine who has light blonde hair tried a little bit and it turned green!It was terrible!My hands got more color than my hair.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!"
1,CAUTION: DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER! I JUST GOT MY PACKAGE AND I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. I PAID ALMOST $11 FOR THIS TINY BOTTLE THAT IS LITERALLY HALF THE SIZE OF MY CELL PHONE (galaxy s3)!!!! THIS IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!! I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING A BIG JAR OF THIS STUFF TO LAST ME AT LEAST A YEAR!! THIS LITTLE THING WON'T LAST MORE THAN 2 USES!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!
2,manic panic hair dye,it didnt work at all. but i think it's all my fault so i really can't say if it's a good product or not when used correctly.
2,Not so great.,"I love manic panic products, but I'll never be buying this particular dye again. The runoff from rinsing it out stained my tub, shower curtain, and most of my skin blue. Normally with manic panic products any staining will wash off fairly quickly- not the case here. I spent more than half an hour scrubbing and my hands and feet are still VERY blue.My hair, by the way is also very blue. Not green. It's navy blue. My hair was bleached to a light blonde when I applied the dye, so I honestly don't know why the color is so off. It's still a pretty color, so that part isn't too upsetting, but it's still not at all the color it was supposed to be.tl;dr- I would highly recommend every hue of manic panic dye EXCEPT THIS ONE."
2,Ehhh.,"The turquoise color is nice at first, but honestly to get it vibrant, you have to leave it in for an hour or more. It also fades VERY quickly. I grabbed this dye instead of Special Effects which is what I usually use. Never again. The dye is runny and just kinda goes everywhere. I get a ton of compliments when it's freshly dyed, but otherwise it gets called a green color. It's an ugly green color too. I can't wait until I can dye over this with some Special Effects."
1,"Litterally the worst hair dye I've ever used, ever, and I dye my hair A LOT.","I put this in, expecting it to work since it cost so much. Alas, not only did it hardly dye any of my hair, the portion that it did dye came out a hideous color nothing like it was supposed to. I even took the extra measure of leaving it in twice as long as I needed too, just to make sure the color soaked in, since i always do that when I dye my hair and it works incredibly well. I have dyed my hair various colors at least 10 times, and it has never turned out so badly. Even the time I had to mix 6 different hair dyes and some water together to get enough to cover my whole head turned out better than this. I will never be buying anything from manic panic ever again. They have ruined my Halloween costume with their horrible product. I just hope I can find a way to cover this up before school tomorrow so I don't have to break my arm to get out of going to school."
5,Highly Recommended and After Care Advice,"My wife uses this often. It is the longest she's used any one brand of hair coloring. Even though she has naturally black hair, this hair color cream does a great job of giving it a nice vibrant.Her advice about after care is to be careful when your hair is wet during the first week after coloring it. She said that when her hair is wet the coloring may bleed onto clothing a little. This only lasts a week, and of course Manic Panic will wash right out of clothing, but it's something to be aware of if you are off to a meeting in the morning and the hair is still a little wet.This is a very safe hair coloring that does a good job of adding color to even hard-to-color black hair."
4,Love Manic Panic,Ive been using Manic Panic dyes for a couple years now and I have to say the blue is a little harder to work with only because it fades so quickly. I find leaving it on for the full 30 minutes and completely coating it and re-applying after 15 minutes.Using less shampoo also helps with fading but over all I really love the color extremely happy with this product.
2,Didn't take,"The seller was great, shipping went wonderfully. But this dye would not take, I tried three times. Placing it over my pale green, bleaching it again then applying next day and leaving it on all night. I would only get a few purplish my little pony style streaks. So I wouldn't reccomed this."
3,Beautiful on some of my hair..,"Packaging was cute, it came undamaged. I was super excited to use it on my hair, it was a very light blond without yellow or orange tones in it..However it turned my hair silvery in some parts, a beautiful amethyst in others, a bright blue on some pieces, and a plain purple on others. o_O I like the variety of colors, EXCEPT the silver. If it weren't for the weird silver it'd be great! :D My hair was super soft after using it, and it was shipped a day early."
1,NOT USB 2.0 - limited to 12 Mb/s,"Despite the description listed by the seller, this unit can only handle slow USB 1.1 speeds.The manufacturers website makes this clear: [...]"
2,"Nice idea, however.........","I purchased four of these and am very disappointed in that they don't fit my windows. They would, but it would leave enough room for my little dog to escape.The window in your vehicle has to be straight, not rounded like my Camry windows.Should be in description of item that it only fits SUV's, as far as I can determine.Here they sit."
5,A great way to reinforce a love of reading!,"Is your preschooler a fan of Dora the Explorer? If so, Dora the Explorer: Dora's Royal Rescue, is a DVD your going to want to add to your collection. The DVD includes a double-length episode, ""Dora's Royal Rescue,"" which features the voices of Andy Garcia as Don Quixote and Placido Domingo as Malambruno. Also included, is the new-to-DVD episode, ""Dora's Knighthood Adventure,"" which features the voice of Garcia as Don Quixote.This has fast become one of our car travel favorites! The boys love Dora & Boot's adventures and I love that they are defending their love of books and reading - which reinforces just how important reading is! One of the other things that I like is that because this is a double length adventure, it moves beyond the 'typical' layout a little bit, making it just different enough to be more inviting to my parental ears!Disclaimer: I received a copy of this DVD in exchange for my honest opinion"
5,Buy it - You won't be disappointed,This Bible software contains a lot of useful material for any student of the Word. The material is easy to use and presented in an attractive format.
1,Cheap quality.,"I always buy items sold by amazon.com directly, so did this one, but this product gives a feeling its been bought by some thrid party and then amazon.com have forwarded it to me.The back cover had some problem..."
2,Choose a different phone,"I bought this phone last week and although I can live with it, there are many things that just bug the heck out of me.I'll list here what I didn't like:*The screen is way too small, especially for a phone this bulky.*The screen is VERY hard to see in sunlight.*The 262,000 color screen, well, it's not enough.*camera is of poor quality (it's VGA)*The navigation is awkward and not very intuitive.Just pick a different phone."
4,Detroit Lions NFL Men's Uncuffed Hat,"One size is supposed to fit all, but my husband has a relatively small/medium head and he said it barely fits him. So, if you have a big head, don't buy this one.Other than that, this is a great hat! Looks great, feels great. Hubby very pleased!"
3,Its ok,"Its alright, but fits a little loose, it doesnt really constrain down to your head and fit tightly like a beanie normally does. I am a really big Lions fan though,so I was still happy when I got it anyway, but its an alright beanie. Not my favorite I own tho."
5,"Irresistible book for young and struggling readers, especially boys!","This series is fantastic for early readers--vivid pictures, manageable text, and a great introduction to natural wonders and animal life around the globe. I use these books with students at the East Harlem Tutorial Program in New York City--and they just can't get enough of them. I highly recommend them to parents and teachers everywhere. The bilingual books are also terrific with my English Language Learners."
1,Junk,"The mic barely picks up any sound, there is tons of noise in the signal, and the components are terrible quality. I got what I paid for. Get a more expensive set."
2,Nice price if you can put up with a few bugs,I purchased this product for my boss to record his meetings. It seems cheaply made. The buttons make a distinct cheap-sounding scratching sound when used. Voice quality is OK. The price is very reasonable compared to more expensive systems if you can put up with a few quarks.
3,Not recommended for children,"There are 72 sudoku puzzles in this book. All the puzzles are 9x9 grids. The solutions are all at the end of the book. The first 4 pages contain hints and strategies for solving Sudoku puzzles. Many of the puzzles in this book are hard - definitely not for children. For simpler puzzles, check the two books ""The Big Book of Kindergarten Sudoku"" and ""More Kindergarten Sudoku"" for a variety of simple 4x4 puzzles especially designed for children."
5,Great Debut Album From Madonna's Long-Time Back-Up Singer,"When you are an international phenomenon like Madonna, you want to make sure you select background singers who are good and have voices that blend well with yours. Donna Delory has one of those fantastic voices.This album was released in 1992. It was the pop quality of the early 90s songs. Very easy to listen to. It contains a variety of songs from ballads to dance songs. There is even a song that Madonna wrote and produced for Donna that she decided she felt didn't fit ""The Immaculate Collection"" when she recorded it so she gave it to Donna. Donna takes the song and makes it one of the stand out hits on the album. You can hear Madonna's back-up vocals, too!There are several stand-out tracks:Think It OverPraying For LoveIt's My houseeJust a DreamWorld With No ShameI love this album!"
3,compilation,"This book is a compilation of several previously released books put together. It's great for those pokemon fans who have not read any of the series, but just a repeat for those who have."
5,Healthy Eating Doesn't Have to Be Difficult!,"After hearing about the Mediterranean Diet for years I finally decided to take the plunge with learning more about this program. This is a great book because it gives you a firm basis in exactly what the Mediterranean Diet is and how to implement it in your life. This book, along with C.D. Shelton'sMediterranean Diet (Mediterranean Diet: Eat, Drink and Be Healthy the Greek Way)are the only Mediterranean Diet books you'll need to succeed in looking and feeling great."
5,The Mediterranean Diet,The book is very interesting with a lot of good information. I bought it for my brother who had 2 strokes and needs to learn to eat better. he also has got a lot of good ideas.
5,"Everyone should read this, or any thing about this diet","Writing is a bit...exagerated, but the information is sound. My problem will be to get my meat and potatoes partner to adopt this."
3,Not What I Expected,"This book is so full of theory and scientific-type data that I lost interest in it early on. If I hadn't already had a bit of exposure due to The Sonoma Diet, I wouldn't even bother with this book at all. In fact, it was due to the similarity of The Sonoma Diet that I purchased this book, and now I'm not sure it was a good use of my money."
2,So-So,"You can pick up a few good nutrition ideas here, and maybe one or two good recipes: but the pickings here are slim, in both areas. This book is not a complete waste of money, and it's not terrific either: just so-so, any way you slice it."
4,"Selling a lifestyle change, not a ""diet plan""","What I liked most about this book was that it wasn't just a few pages of dumbed down info and then straight into recipes. This book is helping me work subtle lifestyle changes into my kitchen, and helping me to re-learn how to savor food again. Maybe because I am a nurse it is easier to understand some of the words and phrases. And I appreciated the inputs of simialr foods from different areas of the world that have the same type dietary considerations even if they aren't from around the Mediterranean region. Again, I don't feel like the book is trying to sell me anything, like other books that also go on to try to sell the cookbook seperate, a diet plan, a health consult, a workout plan, etc. Thanks to the authors!"
4,Oops! I should have read the reviews.,"I was looking for a book of reciepes on the topic. This book has a few reciepes but not too many. Now if you are looking for a book about all the information about this specific diet then this book is for you. It covers topics such as the mediterranean diet food pyramid,fats & how olive oil fits in,heavy use of veggies as the book brings out is the heart & soul of the diet. Fruits are covered,grains & legumes,meat, fish, dairy, & eggs. Even the mediterranean lifestyle is covered. A lot of information. But.not enough reciepes."
1,Bad,"I don't know where the author of this book has read or seen a person living in the Mediterranean area and eating according to the Mediterranean diet eat or drink soy products, this is simply not true, if a vegan wants to eat according to the Mediterranean diet has to eliminate soy and seitan from his/her eating plan. It's not a good idea to describe an eating plan and living style and modify it, this isn't that plan anymore, it's something else."
3,"Great book, awesome price.",This is a great book with a lot of good information. The price was very reasonable and was sent in a timely manner.
1,waste of paper & ink,"Glad I only paid a penny for this book. Most any one could figure this out without a book to tell us... nothing.Maybe a Mediterranean Cook Book would have been better? ...no, wait... I already looked those over. Seemed like a bit of useless info to me."
3,Mediterranean diet.,It is a good read if you want to eat healthy. The problem that I see with it is that a lot of the food is not readally available where I live.
3,Not crazy about the paperback format,"To be honest, I am just not enough of a cook to really get into this cookbook, but I think if the format were nicer it might be more enticing to cook from. It is just a small cheap paper back with no photos...hard to keep open if you were trying to look at a recipe, hard to keep my interest enough to read it. But there are some recipes that look interesting and the info on the diet is probably good as well -- not revolutionary, but seems fairly sound."
4,Easy Read and Informative,"Looking into this ""diet"" at a doctor recommendation and found that in reading this, not only is it a diet but written in a way to make you think more about a lifestyle than a dreaded diet. Lots of information about food, some good recipes listed, and makes you want to make a change in life."
4,pretty good,it was a good book i think it could have been better but it is all about elizabeth so it really catches you up with her life right now
3,Color is off,"I purchased the lime greem mesh shirt as part of a costume for our daughter. The quality and fit of the shirt are fine and happy with that part. But the color is way off. It looks more like neon yellow, similar to a highlighter pen. It does not resemble the color sample shown, nor does it look like any lime we've ever seen as described."
4,Good for small dogs - reasonably priced,"The doggy steps are easy to assemble and the cover fits well. Our beagle uses the steps with ease. As stated in the doggy steps information, the steps have a weight limit and should not be used above the weight limit."
4,dog steps,"Look good, but my hubby was afraid to have the dogs use them, because they might fall. grrr I gave them away."
1,Junk,A piece of junk. I bought two. I should have read the product descriptionmore carefully. They look like a child's cheap plastic Christmas toy. Bothare off to Goodwill. Embarrassing to have in the house. Out they go!
1,Piece of Crap,"I'm a pretty easy going person, and it takes a lot to offend me... but truly, this product is a piece of crap. It is basically several pieces of flimsy wood that you have to assemble yourself, and they give you a low-quality piece of fabric to put over it. It looks like something a child would put together in wood shop. I sent it back for a refund.I whole-heartedly would NOT recommend this to anyone. Spend a few extra bucks and get something durable."
2,Deluxe Doggy Steps Review,"These steps are acceptable for the price paid, but they are slightly rickety. Putting them together was easy, and the directions were very clear. We thought we were purchasing the foam steps with a cover, so we were very disappointed in the product when it arrived. It should be noted very clearly in the product description that they are made of plastic. Our little dog enjoys climbing up and down on them."
5,"Easy assembly, great for my dog!","Assembly was very easy with the instructions.They even give you tips on how to help your dog get used to using the stairs.I first got it because my dog (toy poodle) is getting a little older and my bed is high off the ground. As of lately he would cry in the middle of the night for me to pick him up onto my bed. In need of uninterrupted sleep, I caved in and decided to try the TeleBrands Deluxe Doggy Steps. At first my toy poodle was a little hesitant, but after encouragement and reward, he uses it all the time! The steps don't look cheap and fit in great with my bedroom (something I was a little nervous about). Overall, Great buy!"
2,Copy of Original,"Poor copy of the original ""Doggy Steps."" Cover fits loosely, more difficult to make the pieces fit and they appear to be of lower quality."
3,Doggy Step,When I purchased the item I thought it looked bigger then the actual item. When I received and I had my dogs try it and it was still to small for them to jump onto the bed or chairs.
1,Total junk,"This looks good in the picture, but is very poor quality. The cover doesn't fit the flimsy frame well at all, and the puppy is afraid to use it. I have taller stair of a different brand that he's fine with, so I guess I'll be ordering a smaller replacement for this one. Total waste of money and of an hour assembling this!"
3,Nice steps but moves on hardwood,I bought these steps so my dog could get onto the bed. I have hardwood floors and the steps have a tendency to move when the dog uses them. I bought a piece of rubber to put on the bottom and it seems to have corrected the issue. If you have rugs then these steps will work well.
4,Pet steps,"I needed something for my aging cat that would help her get up and down off the furniture and bed. The steps are very helpful, but need to be one step taller. I think it should come with it, but you have to order the 4th step separately. The nice thing was that the assembly is easy and the sheepskin cover fits nicely without slipping. I recommend it for small pets and elderly pets that need help so they don't jump down and injure themselves and can get to you to cuddle on the couch with ease. Both owner and pet will benefit from the steps."
5,Doggy Steps,These are easy to assemble and lightweight to move around; great for smaller pets. A good buy!
3,dog steps,the steps really are great but they are very small and short. Didn't begin to reach my bed. one more step wouldn't have helped me but to reach a couch they are great.
1,A piece of junk,"I bought this before all the negative reviews were posted below. I have to agree with them. This is a piece of garbage and a rip off. You have to pay another 14.98 (if you include shipping) to get the fourth step. It looks like it will fall apart any minute. And even worse, it comes with a large bright purple slogan across the top step (not depicted in the picture) that you can't remove and that is hideous so it doesn't even blend in with your furniture. Wish I had seen these reviews before wasting my money."
1,Stairs broke,"These plastic stairs collapsed when my 12 year old dachshund finally climbed up them. After all of the work we did to get him to climb them by himself, I don't think he'll be trying out any stairs again. He's only 14 lbs, so they should've held him. What a waste."
3,Good but not!,"The steps are very good & sturdy. Would have worked well if the would have been tall enough. I saw flyer in the box that said order the extra step by calling this number.... so I threw away the box and called the number. Well, the number no longer works, the extension step I can't find anywhere, so the steps are useless to me. An unfortunate mistake on my part."
